2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Schizophrenia is a life-long psychiatric disorder. The cardinal symptoms fall into 3 domains: positive 
symptoms such as delusions and hallucination, negative symptoms such as lack of drive and social 
withdrawal, and cognitive symptoms such as problems with attention and memory. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating mental illness that affects 0.7% of the population worldwide. 
Moreover, an analysis has estimated that the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in Europe 
is 0.31 % and 0.51 % in North America. The prevalence of the disorder seems to be equal in males and 
females, although the onset of symptoms occurs at an earlier age in males than in females. Males tend 
to experience their first episode of schizophrenia in their early 20s, whereas women typically experience 
their first episode in their late 20s or early 30s. Research into a possible link between the geography of 
birth and the development of schizophrenia has provided inconclusive results. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Biological theories of schizophrenia have focused on genetics and, structural and functional 
abnormalities in the brain. Family, twin and adoption studies indicate an important genetic contribution 
to the aetiology of schizophrenia. Most studies seem to agree that many patients appear to suffer from 
a disorder of early brain development. Methodological problems have limited studies into the possible 
aetiology of schizophrenia but many of these problems are being overcome by modern technology.  
Clinically, schizophrenia is heterogeneous and this may point to heterogeneous aetiology. It seems that 
genetics, neurodevelopmental problems, neurochemistry and abnormal connectivity, as well as 
psychosocial stressors probably all contribute to developing the typical clinical pictures of 
schizophrenia. 
Abnormalities in neurotransmission have provided the basis for theories on the pathophysiology of 
schizophrenia. Most of these theories focus on either an excess or a deficiency of neurotransmitters 
including dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate. Other theories implicate aspartate, glycine, and 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as part of the neurochemical imbalance of schizophrenia. 
Abnormal activity at dopamine receptor sites (specifically D2) is thought to be associated with many of 
the symptoms of schizophrenia. Four dopaminergic pathways have been implicated. The nigrostriatal 
pathway originates in the substantia nigra and ends in the caudate nucleus. Low dopamine levels within 
this pathway are thought to affect the extrapyramidal system, leading to motor symptoms. The 
mesolimbic pathway, extending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to limbic areas, may play a role 
in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia in the presence of excess dopamine. The mesocortical 
pathway extends from the VTA to the cortex. Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia 
are thought to be caused by low mesocortical dopamine levels. The tuberoinfundibular pathway projects 
from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. A decrease or blockade of tuberoinfundibular dopamine 
results in elevated prolactin levels and, as a result, galactorrhea, ammenorrhea, and reduced libido.

The serotonin hypothesis for the development of schizophrenia emerged as a result of the discovery 
that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) enhanced the effects of serotonin in the brain.1 Subsequent 
research led to the development of drug compounds that blocked both dopamine and serotonin 
receptors, in contrast to older medications, which affected only dopamine receptors. The newer 
compounds were found to be effective in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia. 
Another theory for the symptoms of schizophrenia involves the activity of glutamate, the major 
excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. This theory arose in response to the finding that 
phenylciclidine and ketamine, two noncompetitive NMDA/glutamate antagonists, induce 
schizophrenia-like symptoms. This, in turn, suggested that NMDA receptors are inactive in the normal 
regulation of mesocortical dopamine neurons, and pointed to a possible explanation for why patients 
with schizophrenia exhibit negative, affective, and cognitive symptoms. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating psychotic disorder characterized by positive, negative and 
cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms are the most easily identified and these are: delusions, 
hallucinations, and abnormal motor behaviour in varying degrees of severity. Negative symptoms are 
more difficult to diagnose but are associated with high morbidity as they disturb the patient’s emotions 
and behaviour. The most common negative symptoms are diminished emotional expression and 
avolition (decreased initiation of goal-directed behaviour). Patients may also experience alogia and 
anhedonia.  Cognitive symptoms are the newest classification in schizophrenia. These symptoms are 
nonspecific; therefore, they must be severe enough for another individual to notice them. Cognitive 
symptoms include disorganized speech, thought, and/or attention, ultimately impairing the individual’s 
ability to communicate. 
A patient usually gradually recovers from the first episode of schizophrenia. However, relapses are 
common, and pattern of the illness during the first 5 years indicates generally the course. In general, 
deterioration in the patient’s baseline functioning after each relapse happens. Positive symptoms tend 
to ease with time, but the socially debilitating negative and deficit symptoms may increase and become 
more severe. Only 10-20% of schizophrenia patients have been described to achieve a good outcome. 
It has been estimated that 20-30% continue to experience moderate symptoms and 40-60% remain 
significantly impaired. This means that patients with schizophrenia often have great difficulties in 
integrating in society and to normal life by impairing functioning, for example through the loss of an 
acquired capability to earn a livelihood or the disruption of studies. In addition, comorbidity with other 
somatic diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, as well as with 
substance abuse is common in patients with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia have a 40-60% 
higher rate of dying prematurely than general population due to physical health problems and suicide. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia in addition to psychosocial 
interventions. Antipsychotics diminish symptoms and reduce relapse rates. Antipsychotics have a wide 
variety of pharmacological properties but they all have a capacity to antagonize postsynaptic dopamine 
receptors in the brain. 
In the event of an acute psychotic episode, drug therapy should be administered immediately. During 
the first seven days of treatment, the goal is to decrease hostility and to attempt to return the patient 
to normal functioning (e.g., sleeping and eating).  At the start of treatment, appropriate dosing should 
be titrated based on the patient’s response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 11/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment during the acute phase of schizophrenia is followed by maintenance therapy, which should 
be aimed at increasing socialization and at improving self-care and mood. Maintenance treatment is 
necessary to help prevent relapse. The incidence of relapse among patients receiving maintenance 
therapy, compared with those not receiving such therapy, is 18% to 32% versus 60% to 80%, 
respectively. Drug therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after the remission of the first 
psychotic episode. 
Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are the agents of choice for first-line treatment of 
schizophrenia. Clozapine is not recommended because of its risk of agranulocytosis. SGAs are usually 
preferred over first-generation (typical) antipsychotics (FGAs) because they are associated with fewer 
extrapyramidal symptoms. However, SGAs tend to have metabolic side effects, such as weight gain, 
hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. These adverse effects can contribute to the increased risk of 
cardiovascular mortality observed in schizophrenia patients. 
About the product 
Brexpiprazole is 7-[4-(4-Benzo[b]thiophen-4-ylpiperazin-1-yl) butoxy]quinolin-2(1H)-one, a chemical 
entity discovered by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and is being developed jointly with H. Lundbeck 
A/S.  
Under the name of Rexulti, brexpiprazole 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg was approved 
by the FDA on 07/10/2015 for the treatment of major depressive disorder as an adjunctive therapy to 
antidepressants and for the treatment of schizophrenia. 
Brexpiprazole mode of action, as claimed by the Applicant is: 
i.  
ii.  
partial agonist activity at serotonergic 5-HT1A and at dopaminergic D2 receptors 
antagonist activity at serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors, with similar high affinities at all of these 
receptors  
(Ki: 0.1-0.5 nM);  
iii.  
antagonist activity at noradrenergic α1B/2C with affinity in the same sub-nanomolar Ki range  
(Ki: 0.2-0.6 nM);  
iv.  
a broad spectrum of binding affinities and actions on several other central monoaminergic 
receptor  
subtypes.  
Development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The development program for brexpiprazole does not entirely comply with EMA Guidelines. First, the 
design of the dose response study is a multiple flexible doses study rather than a fixed dose.  
In this regard, the EMA Guidelines for the investigation of products for the treatment of schizophrenia 
state: 
[…] dose-response relationships need to be established in clinical trials using validated efficacy 
endpoints. The minimum effective dose and the dose at which best efficacy is obtained should be 
established. Flexible dose designs are unsuitable to provide this information and therefore designs with 
multiple fixed doses and a placebo control are required. It is preferred to make direct dose comparisons 
of multiple doses in a single study. Dose response is typically established in short-term studies, and this 
information serves as a basis for dose selection in both additional short-term phase 3 studies and the 
longer term maintenance study. It is strongly recommended to establish the dose-response of the 
investigational drug prior to the start of confirmatory trials (Phase 3) as the use of inadequately justified 
doses may hamper interpretation of the latter trials. 
The EMA gave 3 Scientific Advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/261256/2011, EMA/CHMP/SAWP/451459/2012, 
EMA/CHMP/SAWP/352896/2013) on clinical development of brexpiprazole in the treatment of 
schizophrenia and agitation in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

The EMA scientific advice issued in 2011 (EMEA/H/SA/2104/1/2011), warned Applicants on 
uncertainties around the dose and on the need to establish a clear dose-response prior to start a phase 
3 trial. A fixed dose finding study was suggested. 
In addition, the Applicant conducted four pivotal studies three of which were placebo controlled. 
EMA Guidelines for the investigation of products for schizophrenia in this regard state that:  
Crossover designs are unsuitable for trials in patients with schizophrenia. Confirmatory trials should be 
double-blind, randomised, parallel group trials.  
The study protocol should provide a justification of the choice of the active comparator – this would 
normally be an active comparator with proven efficacy and, if from a similar class, a similar clinical 
pharmacological profile to the test product. If the product is the first in its class an appropriate active 
comparator would be a product licensed in the target indication and population or, if there is no suitable 
licensed product, a medicinal product recognised as the “gold standard” for the target indication and 
population in clinical practice should be chosen as a suitable active comparator.  
If the aim of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority to an active comparator, then a three-arm study 
of placebo, test product and active comparator is recommended (see also section 4.4.3.7.). Superiority 
to placebo should be demonstrated in order to ensure assay sensitivity of the study.  
Alternatively, a two-arm study of test and active comparator would be acceptable provided superiority 
of the test product over an appropriately justified active comparator was demonstrated. 
Having all this above considered the most logical comparator in a fixed dose study (or studies) should 
have been aripiprazole. 
In addition, advice was given on the planned bioequivalence study between oral tablet and the future 
oral solution. 
General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
GMP: 
A valid Qualified Person declaration, confirming that the active substance manufacturing sites operate 
in compliance with current guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice for active substances, has been 
provided. 
Valid GMP certificates have been provided for the batch releasers and manufacturers of the drug 
product. 
GLP: 
All safety/toxicological in vitro and in vivo studies on brexpiprazole and on its main metabolite were 
performed between 2006 and 2012 in Japanese test facilities. Studies were declared to be GLP 
compliant: since Japan joints the mutual acceptance of data, this can be considered acceptable. 
GCP: 
The clinical trials conducted to support this submission were performed in accordance with the 
principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH), and those carried out within the European Community met the ethical requirements of Directive 
2001/20/EC. Clinical trials carried out outside the European Union were conducted in accordance with 
the principles of GCP and the ethical requirements equivalent to the provisions of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Only a small number of patients from Dr. Podea’s site participated in the brexpiprazole schizophrenia 
clinical program. Excluding these patients from the efficacy reanalysis did not have any impact and the 
conclusion on the efficacy analyses remains the same. Similarly, review of all Treatment Emergent 
Adverse Events (TEAEs) at the site including narratives for all Immediately Reported Events and given 
the low number of subjects at the site in comparison to the cumulative safety database, it is concluded 
that the safety profile of brexpiprazole remains unchanged.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. Brexpiprazole is synthesized in 5 main steps using 
well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene bag which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC 
and EC 10/2011 as amended, closed with a tie-wrap, which is then packaged in another polyethylene 
bag and closed with a tie-wrap. The double-polyethylene bag is stored in a fibre drum with a securely 
fitting lid. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description (visual), identification (UV, IR), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.). Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold 
according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications 
have been set.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 6 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from one of the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. 
Bulk container stability studies are in progress for three pilot-scale batches of brexpiprazole 
manufactured at the second proposed manufacturing site. Samples will be stored in the intended 
commercial package under long term conditions and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions. 
The stability protocols and packages for the batches made at this manufacturing site are the same as 
those for the first manufacturing site. 
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, melting point, drug-related impurities, 
residual solvents, water content, assay, and particle size distribution. The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
Little or no variability was observed for all tested parameters for all batches manufactured by both sites 
under both accelerated and long term conditions.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No significant 
changes were observed to any of the tested parameters. The photostability study confirms that 
brexpiprazole is not light sensitive.  
Results under stressed conditions at 50 °C (closed amber glass bottle), 25 °C / 90% RH (open Petri 
dish), and 40 °C / 75% RH (open Petri dish) for 3 months and under white fluorescent/near ultraviolet 
for 600 hours were also provided for 1 pilot scale batch from one manufacturing site. The stability 
results under stress conditions demonstrate the stability of the active substance to heat and humidity.

The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period without specific storage 
conditions in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
RXULTI is presented as light brown (0.25 mg), light orange (0.5 mg), light yellow (1 mg), light green (2 
mg), light purple (3 mg), and white (4 mg) round, shallow, convex, bevel-edged film-coated tablets, 
debossed with BRX and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively on one side. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except the coating agents, which are well-known mixtures compliant with in house 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The tablet dosage form was chosen as a convenient delivery system for the oral route of administration.  
The formulation development of brexpiprazole is based on prior knowledge and systematic enhanced 
approaches. 
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was established based on previous experience and potential 
critical quality attributes (CQAs).  
The active substance attributes and excipient attributes were assessed to understand their influences 
on potential CQAs.Design of experiments (DoEs) were carried out to evaluate and understand the 
formulation and granulation process factors. The dissolution test method for brexpiprazole tablets was 
designed so that it could distinguish between differences in formulation and manufacturing process 
variants.  
All strengths of the tablets used in clinical trials and the proposed commercial tablets were the same 
shape, 6 mm in diameter and 93 mg of tablet weight, and no changes were made except the 
film-coating components and debossing. All clinical tablets were the same red colour while the proposed 
commercial tablets differ in colours for strength differentiation. 
The finished product is manufactured by wet granulation method using a high shear mixer granulator. 
There have been no significant changes in the manufacturing process from phase 1 clinical trial tablets 
to the proposed commercial tablets except for the drying method and an increase of batch size.  
The primary packaging is aluminium/PVC blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The granules for brexpiprazole tablets are manufactured by a wet granulation process using a high 
shear mixer granulator. The wet granules are dried, sized, blended and mixed with lubricant, following 
by compression into tablets with a rotary tablet press and film-coating. The process is considered to be 
a non-standard manufacturing process. 
Validation of 6 commercial batches (one per strength) has been performed. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description/appearance (visual), identification (HPLC-PDA), impurities/degradation products, 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018

uniformity of dosage units by content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), dissolution, assay (HPLC), and microbial 
limit test (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches per strength of finished product stored for up to 36 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the 
medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested against the same specifications as for release. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating. 
No significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed when the finished product 
was stored under long term or accelerated conditions. 
In addition, photostability studies were conducted on loose tablets, and on tablets packaged in 
PVC/aluminium foil blisters. One representative batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined 
in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results of the 
photostability studies indicate theproductis no sensitive to light. 
Open dish studies were conducted on loose tablets using one representative batch of each strength over 
periods of 3 months. The data from the open dish studies demonstrate the stability of brexpiprazole 
tablets to humidity. 
A freeze-thaw cycling study was performed on the tablets packaged in PVC/aluminium foil blisters or 
double polyethylene bags/fibre drums using two representative lots of each strength, stored for 10 
hours at –20 ºC and 10 hours at 40 ºC, with a complete cycle every 24 hours for 2 weeks. The data 
indicate that the product is not affected by temperature excursions and may be shipped through normal 
distribution channels. 
An elevated temperature (50 ºC) stress study was carried out on one representative batch of tablets of 
all strengths, packaged in PVC/aluminium foil blisters over a period of 3 months. The data from elevated 
temperature study demonstrate the stability to heat.  
Stability studies were also conducted on two production scale batches of bulk tablets of each strength 
packaged in the proposed double polyethylene bags/fibre drum shipping container, stored at 30 
ºC/65% RH for 12 months. Since no significant changes were observed at any of the test points, a 12 
month holding period has been assigned for the bulk tablets in double polyethylene bags/ fibre drums 
when stored below 30 ºC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without any special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacological profile of brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) was characterised in several in vitro 
receptor, transporter, and enzyme assays, both in binding studies and in relevant functional tests. In 
most of the studies, the in vitro brexpiprazole features were compared to those of aripiprazolefrom the 
same MAH approved for the treatment of schizophrenia (Abilify). 
Additionally, in vitro binding affinities and functional effects of the major metabolite, the S-oxide of 
benzothiophene moiety of brexpiprazole DM-3411 (Lu AF59163), were determined for a broad range of 
receptors.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Dopaminergic receptors 
In human receptor binding assays, brexpiprazole showed the following affinity (Ki nM) to the D receptor 
subtypes tested: D2L (0.3) >D3 (1.1)> D4 (6.3)>D1 (160). High affinity was demonstrated to D2L and 
D3, while moderate and very low affinities were shown towards D4 and D1. Binding affinity of 
brexpiprazole to D2L and D3 was quite similar than that of aripiprazole (0.87 and 1.6, respectively): 
both receptors are known to play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. 
Functional assays were only performed for D2L and D3 that, together with D4, are receptors coupled to 
inhibitory G-proteins. On D2L, brexiprazole inhibited the cAMP accumulation more potently than 
aripiprazole (nM EC50=4.0 vs 5.6) but with a lower intrinsic activity relative to dopamine (Emax %=40 
vs 60). A similar behavior was observed when the calcium mobilization assay was used, even if this 
latter test was much less sensitive than cAMP assay.  
Also on D3, brexpiprazole inhibited the cAMP accumulation more potently than aripiprazole (nM 
EC50=2.8 vs 5.9) with a lower intrinsic activity relative to dopamine (Emax % =15 vs 28).  
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 19/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on these in vitro results, OPC-34712 could be classified as a partial agonist for dopamine D2L and 
D3 receptors with lower (approx 1.5-1.8 fold for D2L and D3, respectively) intrinsic activity compared 
to aripiprazole and an higher potency. This can translate into an in vivo brexpiprazole behavior/features 
closer to that of traditional antagonist drugs than aripiprazole. D3 weak partial agonism could improve 
cognitive and emotional symptoms.  
Serotoninergic receptors 
In human receptor binding assays, brexpiprazole showed the following affinity (Ki nM) to the 5HT 
receptor subtypes tested: 5HT1A (0.12-0.15) >5HT2A (0.47)> 5HT2B (1.9)> 5HT7 (3.7)> 5HT7A 
(9.5)> 5HT2CS23C (12) >5HT1B (32) =5HT2C (VSV) (34) > 5HT6 (58) > 5HT5A (140). 
High affinity was demonstrated to 5HT1A, 2A, 2B, 7 while moderate affinity was shown towards 5HT7A, 
2CS23C, 1B, 2C (VSV) and 6, and very low affinity towards 5HT5A. Binding affinity of brexpiprazole was 
generally higher than that of aripiprazole: 6- to 10-fold higher to 5HT1A (0.88 in brain tissue -superior 
frontal cortex- and 1.3 in cloned receptor), 10-fold higher to 5HT2A (4.7), 3-fold higher to 5HT2C (VSV) 
and to 5HT7A.  
In functional assay measuring [35S]-GTPS binding to cells expressing cloned 5-HT1A receptors, 
brexpiprazole acted as potent (EC50=0.49 nM) partial agonist leading to increase of binding with an 
Emax of 60% relative to serotonin: the maximum intrinsic activity vs serotonin was slightly lower than 
that of aripiprazole (73%) even if brexpiprazole was > 4-fold potent (nM EC50 0.49 vs 2.1). The same 
behavior was observed when the superior frontal cortex receptor (not known whether it was from 
healthy or schizophrenic subject) was tested. However, at comparable Ki values, in superior frontal 
cortex absolute EC50 and Emax values were much lower than that found in the cloned assay in HeLa 
cells (33% vs 60% in HeLa cells). It is noted that in superior frontal cortex the intrinsic activity for 
brexpiprazole was calculated vs the agonist compound 8-OH-DPAT and not vs setotonin that reached an 
higher maximal effect (approx. 120% vs 90% 8-OH-DPAT): this further overstimates the value.  
Brexpiprazole showed to be a moderate antagonist towards 5HT2A (IC50=6.5 nM) > 2B (IC50=14 nM) 
in functional assay measuring serotonin-induced production of inositol monophosphate (IP1): no 
comparison with aripiprazole is possible since this latter was not tested. 
Brexpiprazole showed to be a weak antagonist towards 5HT6 and 7A in functional assay measuring 
cAMP accumulation. The 5HT7A receptor isoform is the most predominant isoform expressed in human 
brain (limbic brain regions that regulate motions, mood and cognition) over 7B and 7D. Since 
aripiprazole was not tested in these assays, no comparison is possible. 
Brexpiprazole showed to be a moderate partial agonist towards the 5HT2C (VSV) receptor using the 
[35S]-GTPS assay. The 5HT2C (VSV) receptor isoform was selected for functional assay since it is one 
of the predominant splice variant isoforms expressed in human brain. Despite being 2-fold potent and 
2-fold affine to 5HT2C (VSV) than aripiprazole, brexpiprazole showed similar Emax vs serotonin (approx 
10%).The Applicant did not perform any functional assay for human D4 and 5HT1B receptors for which 
brexpiprazole showed a moderate binding affinity (Ki = 6.3 and 32 nM, respectively). 
Adrenergic receptors 
Brexpiprazole showed high affinity towards the human adrenergic receptor alpha 1B (Ki = 0.17 nM), 
alpha 2C (Ki = 0.59-1.0 nM), and alpha 1D (Ki = 2.6 nM), moderate affinity to the alpha 2A receptor (Ki 
= 15-21 nM), alpha 2B receptor (Ki = 17 nM), beta 1 receptor (Ki = 59 nM) and beta 2 receptor (Ki = 
67 nM), low binding affinity to the beta 3 receptor (47% inhibition at 10 μM). 
A complete cellular functional screening of brexpiprazole on adrenergic receptors was performed. 
Brexpiprazole showed potent antagonism on alpha 1B (cIC50 = 0.66 nM cAMP accumulation assay) and 
alpha 1A receptors (cIC50 = 5.0 nM calcium mobilization assay), moderate antagonism at alpha 1D 
(cIC50 = 19 nM inositol-1-phosphate) and alpha 2C receptors (cIC50 = 62 nM cAMP accumulation 
Assessment report

assay), and low antagonism at beta 1 (cIC50 = 160 nM cAMP accumulation assay), alpha 2A (cIC50 
>140 nM impedance assay), alpha 2B receptor (cIC50 >1200 nM cAMP accumulation assay), beta 2 
receptor (cIC50 =230 nM cAMP accumulation assay), and beta 3 receptors (no significant inhibition at 
10 μM, cAMP accumulation assay). Since aripiprazole was not tested in these assays, no direct 
comparison is possible; it is known that qualitatively aripiprazole shares the same adrenergic profile 
with brexpiprazole. However, brexpiprazole showed a 60-100 fold difference in affinity vs potency 
(antagonism) at the human alpha 2C receptor unlike aripiprazole and the reason for this difference, 
remains unclear. 
Histaminergic receptor  
Brexpiprazole showed a moderate binding affinity to H1 receptor (Ki 19 nM) on which acted as a 
moderate antagonism (cIC50 = 6.8 nM). 
In summary, in in vitro human cloned receptors, brexpiprazole showed a high binding affinity for 5HT1A 
> alpha1B > D2L > 5HT2A > alpha2C. Its intrinsinc activity as partial agonist is: 5HT1A > D2L > D3. Its 
antagonistic potency is: alpha1B > alpha1A > 5HT2A.While affinity and potency were overall higher 
compared with aripiprazole, Emax values were overall lower than aripiprazole. In conclusion, the lower 
intrinsic activity at D2 receptors makes brexpiprazole a step closer to D2 antagonism on the 
agonist-antagonist spectrum. Along with less intrinsic ability to D2 receptor, brexpiprazole has a 
greater potency than aripiprazole with regard to D2, D3, 5HT1A alpha1A receptors. 
Brexpiprazole major human metabolite DM-3411 displayed affinity for several human receptors 
although in a lower extent than the parent compound. High affinities (Ki ≤5 nM) were observed for 
5HT2A, 5HT2B, and D2L receptors, while moderate affinities (Ki between 5 and 100 nM) were shown for 
D2Short > 5HT1A > D3 > 1B > H1 > 1A > 5HT7. At D2L receptor the binding affinity of DM-3411 was 
approx 10-fold lower than the parent compound. Regarding its functionality, DM-3411 was a weaker 
partial agonist (Emax 22%) on 5HT1A vs brexpiprazole. It acted as an antagonist towards 5HT2B 
receptor showing 63% inhibition in IP1 assay. Differently from brexpiprazole at D2Short and D3 
receptors DM-3411 acted as antagonists with potencies of 4.1 nM and 38 nM, respectively. The quite 
potent antagonism of metabolite DM-3411 towards dopaminergic receptors is not in line with the partial 
agonism of brexpiprazole. It should noted that D2Short receptors are mainly autoreceptor (differently 
from the primarily a postsynaptic D2L isoform receptor) which provides feedback inhibition that controls 
cell firing and the synthesis, release, and uptake of dopamine; antagonism at D2S receptors 
increases dopaminergic release.  
Although in PK distribution study, DM-3411 was not detected in the rat brain following single oral dose 
of 1000 mg/kg dual-label 14C-brexpiprazole (report 020074), no brain distribution studies was carried 
out in monkey and/or human tissues. Although with 16-fold lower affinity than brexpiprazole, DM-3411 
still binds with high affinity to hD2L receptor (Ki =5 nM) and it showed a potent antagonism activity to 
hD2Short (IC50<5 nM). A weaker than to D2L antagonist activity was also observed to hD3 receptors. 
Differently from brexpiprazole, DM-3411 had no effect (agonist or antagonist) for 5HT2A receptors 
although it bound highly to them. DM-3411 bound to rat 5HT1D moderately (Ki 48 nM) showing an 
intrinsic activity (Emax) of 55% (impedance assay). 
DM-3411 showed a much lower ability than brexpiprazole in binding the human dopamine transporter 
(50% vs 90%) and similar ability to bind serotonin tranporter (approx 65%). However, DM-3411 will 
unlikely influence the central effects of brexpiprazole in humans due to its poor CNS permeability 
demonstrated in rat following oral administration and its unability to increase dopamine release in 
microdialysis study in the rat.

Other minor metabolites of brexpiprazole were detected to be able to bind to human D2 receptors. 
These are OPC-54050 (0.518 nM), DM-3404HCL (0.324 nM), DM-3412 (0.175 nM), DM-3413 (0.355 
nM), each with very similar Ki value to the parent compound (0.295 nM), and are therefore considered 
to be pharmacologically active. However, according to results from multiple dose mass balance clinical 
trial (CSR 331-08-205), the potential patient exposure to metabolites of brexpiprazole - DM-3411, 
DM-3412, OPC-54050, DM-3404HCL, DM-3413 and SFO-34318, is negligible sufficiently low enough to 
have no or limited pharmacological contribution to the overall pharmacological effect. A single 
metabolite was detected at low levels in the rat brain, SFO-34318, however it is acknowledged that this 
metabolite has limited capacity for pharmacological activity due to its low affinity for human D2 
receptors.  
In vivo occupancy, mechanistic, and behavioral studies were also performed.In 2 separate studies in 
vivo receptor binding and ex vivo autoradiography in rat brain, a time-dependent brexpiprazole binding 
was observed with 90% maximal occupancy at 5HT1A, 75% to 80% maximum occupancy to D2, and 
more moderate occupancy (maximal at 56 and 41%) at both 5HT7 receptors and SERT. Brexpiprazole 
occupancy profile mirrored the in vitro rat binding affinity except for 5HT2A receptor for which the in 
vivo (cortex) occupancy was higher than the in vitro binding affinity data in rat cloned receptor (Ki= 3.8 
nM).  
Brexpiprazole plasma (trunk blood, 2 hrs post dose) exposure was strongly correlated to receptor 
occupancies differently from aripiprazole: in rats, about 50% of D2 and 5HT2A receptors were occupied 
at plasma concentrations reached with oral doses lower than 5 mg/kg (i.e. 49 ng/ml reached with 2.5 
mg/kg; 91 ng/ml reached with 4.6 mg/kg). Indeed, in classical behavioural experiments for D2 
antagonist antipsychotics (see later on), the ED50 for brexpiprazole was lower or close to 5 mg/kg 
value. However, in vivo receptor occupancy cannot be considered without taking into account intrinsic 
activity at D2 receptors and other determinants for the clinical outcome of the medicinal product: 
receptor state (e.g. high/low affinity), density and sensitivity, activation of presynaptic or reserve 
receptors, basal level of dopamine, modulatory effect by concomitant activation of different receptors 
(e.g. brexpiprazole partial agonism to 5-HT1A receptor which regulate dopaminergic neuronal activity).  
These rat plasma concentrations/receptor occupancy curves were used by the Applicant to extrapolate 
human information. In the 2.6.2.6.1 section of the "Pharmacology Written Summary", the Applicant 
stated the following: “, Figure 2.6.2.6.1-1 was generated to illustrate a simulation of estimated receptor 
binding occupancy of several 5-HT receptors in human generated by combining results from in vivo/ex 
vivo binding studies in rats and D2 receptor occupancy study in human patients using positron emission 
tomography (PET). [from Phase I single oral dose of OPC-34712, Protocol 331-07-202]”. This strongly 
suggests that at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) (ie, 4 mg), a substantial level of 
binding would be expected on these receptors in patients."

Figure 2.6.2.6.1-1   Human Occupancy Simulations for Brexpiprazole 
Human occupancy simulations for brexpiprazole at the D2 receptor are from human PET data. The estimated human 
occupancy levels at other targets were calculated from results of rat in vivo and ex vivo binding studies and the PET 
study.101  The estimated occupancy ranges at different steady-state human doses/exposures are indicated by 
boxes. 
The Applicant's conclusions regarding the PD (receptor occupancy)/PK (plasma concentrations from rat 
trunk blood) correlation, extrapolated by rat data, that "this strongly suggests that at the maximum 
recommended human dose of 4 mg, a substantial level of binding would be expected on these receptors 
[D2, 5HT2A, 5HT1A] in patients." appears not adequately supported by clinical evidence for which no 
clear dose-response relationship can be obtained. From the figure above, it seems that even at plasma 
strengths lower than those obtained in patients administered with 4 mg/day, a high receptor occupancy 
predictive of clinical outcome, is reached. The therapeutic window of most antipsychotics in adults with 
schizophrenia is generally recognized as 60–80% occupancy of striatal D2 receptors; greater receptor 
occupancy can lead to cognitive dysfunction as reviewed by Gerretsena et al., 2017 and Reeves et al., 
2017.  
A number of rat microdialysis studies were performed in order to investigate the effect of brexpiprazole 
on extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in brain. 
Acute OPC-34712 > 10 mg/kg slightly inhibited basal levels of extracellular dopamine and moderately 
increased its metabolites 3,4-dihydrox-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the 
nucleus accumbens microdialysate collected 3-hrs post orally dosed rats. This effect correlated with 
brexpiprazole relative intrinsic activity at dopamine hD2L receptors and was intermediate to that 
produced by dopamine D2 receptor partial agonists with higher relative intrinsic activity (e.g. (-)3-PPP, 
and aripiprazole) and to that of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist olanzapine. This is consistent with 
in vitro biochemical evidence that brexpiprazole is a dopamine hD2L receptor partial agonist with a 
lower relative intrinsic activity than aripiprazole. The fact that brexpiprazole (and aripiprazole) did not 
stimulate large increases in extracellular dopamine, DOPAC and HVA can be due to their partial agonism 
to 5-HT1A receptor which regulate dopaminergic neuronal activity. 
Dose-dependent increase of DOPAC and HVA levels was also observed in microdialysate samples of 
medial prefrontal cortex collected 3-hrs post dose of freely-moving orally dosed rats. These effects were 
qualitatively similar to those produced in the same brain region after acute aripiprazole treatment.  
No effect on basal extracellular dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin was recorded in medial 
prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus in microdyalisates collected up to 180 min post-dose, and in 
medial prefrontal cortex of freely-moving orally administered rats no extracellular acetylcholine levels 
were induced by brexpiprazole while a dose-dependent histamine extracellular levels increase was 
Assessment report

observed in microdyalisates collected up to 200 min post-dose: this latter may be likely mediated by 
histamine H1 antagonism (hH1 cIC50=6.8 nM) (report 14805). 
Local infusions of brexpiprazole into the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex of freely 
moving rats saw dose-dependently increased extracellular levels of serotonin but exerted no effects on 
DA and NA levels. This suggests that the lack of effect after systemic administration could be due to the 
multi-receptor profile of brexpiprazole, in which its effect in one brain region may mask the effect in 
other brain regions. Since in the same study, a local infusion of the selective α2 adrenoceptor antagonist 
idazoxan enhanced hippocampal serotonin levels, the Applicant’s hypothesis that brexpiprazole ability 
to increase serotonin levels could be mediated by its antagonism to 2-adrenoceptors is plausible even 
if no functional study was performed on rat adrenergic receptors. Overall, OPC-34712 and aripiprazole 
have the potential to regulate prefrontocortical dopamine function due to their additional action as 
serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. 
Effects on some functional CNS effects mediated by pre- and postsynaptic D2 receptors and by 5HT2A 
receptors were explored in vivo in rats. 
In electrophysiological studies in chloralhydrate-anaesthetized rats dosed IV with brexpiprazole and in 
some cases with aripiprazole, in presynaptic areas (autoreceptors) brexpiprazole acted as a potent 
5-HT2A antagonist, a 5-HT1A agonist, and a D2 partial agonist. Compared to aripiprazole, brexpiprazole 
is a more potent 5-HT1A agonist with less intrinsic activity at D2 autoreceptor. In postsynaptic areas, 
brexpiprazole acted as an antagonist on α1B- and α2-adrenoceptors, the latter located on 5-HT 
terminals. Systemic administration of brexpiprazole did not alter the action of the 5-HT and NE 
transporters, and does not change the responsiveness of 5-HT1A and α2-adrenoceptors found on 
pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of hippocampus. Furthermore, local application of brexpiprazole 
showed full agonistic action on postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. 
In rats treated with SC reserpine and IP 3-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), a 
DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, oral administration of brexpiprazole (1 hour before the sacrifice) 
significantly inhibited the reserpine-induced increase in DOPA accumulation in rat striatum but in a 
lower manner than aripiprazole (2 hour before the sacrifice). These results suggest that brexpiprazole 
has a slightly lower presynaptic dopamine autoreceptor agonistic activity than aripiprazole.  
Dopamine released by the hypothalamus acts as a hormone to inhibit release of prolactin via activation 
of D2 receptors in anterior pituitary cells. Brexpiprazole was able to significantly decrease serum 
hyperprolactinemia induced by reserpine only at low dose of 3 mg/kg in male rats 1 hour before 
sacrifice. In contrast, the D2 receptor antagonist risperidone further increased prolactin levels in male 
rats pretreated with reserpine. The difference between these compounds can be associated with the 
partial agonist activity of brexpiprazole on D2 receptors of the anterior pituitary cells. However, it 
should be noted that in toxicity study 020467, brexpiprazole increased the serum prolactin levels in 
both male and female rats following a single oral administration at 100 mg/kg for males and 30 mg/kg 
for females about 7- and 99-fold than the control after 1 hour after administration. Notwithstanding its 
partial agonism, the ability to increase serum prolactin levels was also observed in clinical trials. In the 
Phase II short-term controlled trial the incidence of prolactin elevations observed in the brexipiprazole 
2-4 mg group (13.7%) and in the 4 mg/day group (15.3%) was higher than the one observed with both 
aripiprazole (0) and quetiapine (8.2%), even though the limited number of patients included in the 
active comparator groups should be taken into account in the interpretation of data (see Clinical safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018

section). The lower intrinsinc activity as D2 agonist respect aripiprazole, which makes brexpiprazole a 
step closer to D2 antagonism, could be responsible to this effect. 
Brexpiprazole was assessed in a series of behavioural studies in rats and monkeys predictive of 
antipsychotic activity. Oral administration of brexpiprazole significantly inhibited the serotonin 
5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI)-induced head twitch in rats 
in a dose dependent manner. The effect of brexpiprazole (administered 1 hour before before the 
injection of DOI) was weaker than those of olanzapine and risperidone and stronger than that of 
aripiprazole (administered 2 hours before the injection of DOI). These results suggest that OPC-34712 
has a postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic action in vivo stronger than aripiprazole.  
The atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone have been shown to have lower incidence of the 
extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and sedative side effects in clinic than the typical antipsychotic 
haloperidol. Catalepsy and ptosis responses are considered as animal models reflecting the EPS and 
sedation. Brexpiprazole induced catalepsy with the maximum response observed at 6 hours postdose: 
in terms of both EC50 and onset time, this effect was stronger than that of aripiprazole and milder than 
that of atypical antipsychotic risperidone. The same trend was observed for ability to induce ptosis. 
Inhibition of conditioned avoidance response (CAR) in rats trained to avoid foot shock after a warning 
tone, is considered as one of the most predictive tests to evaluate the effects on positive symptoms of 
schizophrenia. The dose-dependent effect of oral brexpiprazole in inhibit the conditioned avoidance 
response in rats was stronger than that of aripiprazole and was almost comparable to those of atypical 
antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone. It is noted that brexpiprazole and the other compounds were 
administered 1 hour before the observation while aripiprazole was given 2 hour before testing. 
However, these results account for a lower intrinsic activity of brexpiprazole to D2receptors. 
The effects on apomorphine (APO)-induced behaviours (hyperactivity and stereotypy in rats and eye 
blinking in monkeys) are classical tests for D2 antagonist antipsychotics. APO-induced hyperlocomotion 
was inhibited in rats in a dose-dependent manner following a single oral dose of brexpiprazole. This 
effect was milder than haloperidol and stronger than that of aripiprazole both of which also significantly 
inhibited this behavior. It should be noted that while aripiprazole was administered 2 hour before SC 
injection of APO, the other compounds were administered 1 hour prior APO injection. However, these 
results account for a lower intrinsic activity of brexpiprazole to D2 receptors. 
The effect of brexpiprazole on APO-induced stereotyped behavior was evaluated in rats. Single oral 
doses of brexpiprazole significantly inhibited stereotyped behavior in a dose-dependent manner. The 
effect of brexpiprazole was more potent than that of aripiprazole, weaker than those of haloperidol and 
almost comparable with that of olanzapine and risperidone. These results suggest that OPC-34712 has 
a postsynaptic D2receptor antagonistic action in vivo, comparable to current available antipsychotics 
tested. Aripiprazole was orally administered to rats 2 hours before the SC injection of APO while all other 
compounds were orally administered to rats 1 hour before APO injection. 
Combining results from the 4 studies in rats (on EPS, on conditioned avoidance response, on 
APO-induced hyperlocomotion and stereotyped behavior), the catalepsy and ptosis liability values were 
calculated by the Applicant respect the EPS. The conclusions that OPC-34712 has more possible risk to 
cause a sedation than both aripiprazole and haloperidol (study report 020417) and to induce less 
sedative effect than olanzapine and risperidone in (study report 020244) and that OPC-34712 has a 
lower propensity to induce EPS than those of the atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine and risperidone)

and the typical antipsychotic (haloperidol) (study report 020417), are not easily traslated into clinical 
setting since clinical trials used different comparator. Anyway, it is noted that in short term controlled 
trials 2-4 mg brexpiprazole showed an higher rate of sedation than placebo and EPS-related TEAEs 
(mainly driven by akathisia events) higher than placebo was observed only for 4 mg. Both akathisia and 
sedation are reported as common adverse drug reactions in SmPC section 4.8 and akathisia as an 
important identified risk in RMP is also supported by non-clinical data.  
Spontaneous eye blinking is thought to reflect central dopaminergic function and frequent eye blinking 
occurs in schizophrenia. Single oral doses of brexpiprazole were able to inhibit APO-induced eye blinking 
in a dose-dependent manner in monkeys. This result indicates that brexpiprazole has a D2 receptor 
antagonistic action in cynomolgus monkeys. 
It is known that chronic treatment with D2 receptor antagonist’s increases sensitivity of postsynaptic 
receptors in animals and humans, possibly by increasing the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) 
in the well-known phenomenon of up-regulation. The hypersensitivity of the D2 receptor induced by 
chronic administration of antipsychotics is considered a possible cause of tardive dyskinesia. Repeated 
oral doses of brexpiprazole (6 mg/kg) equivalent to haloperidol 1 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks in rats did not 
relevantly enhanced APO-induced stereotyped behavior in rats (borderline p value 0.0489 vs 
haloperidol). These results indicate that the repeated administration of OPC-34712 has at least a 
comparable potential to enhance sensitivity of postsynaptic D2 receptors than haloperidol; whether this 
translates in a similar potential to induce the tardive dyskinesia haloperidol should be assessed in 
clinical chronic setting. 
Cognitive impairments are a common feature of several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. 
Disturbed cognitive function is observed across a number of domains, including episodic/working 
memory and executive function. Recently, novel rat models have been suggested to mimic cognitive 
deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., deficits after withdrawal of subchronic treatment with the noncompetitive 
NMDA receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP). Different cognitive functions were used for the 
characterization of brexpiprazole action in comparison to aripiprazole.   
Acute administration of brexpiprazole dose-dependently reduced the discrimination index (i.e. time 
spent exploring the novel object adjusted for total exploration time) in subchronic Phencyclidine 
(subPCP)-treated rats in a discrete assay/model system, namely the novel object recognition (NOR) 
validated by Lundbeck. In contrast, aripiprzole failed to attenuate the subPCP-induced deficits in novel 
object exploration.  
In a follow-up study it was shown that both 5-HT1A receptor partial agonism and 5-HT2A receptor 
antagonism contributes to the procognitive activity of oral brexpiprazole (3 mg/kg).The Applicant 
concludes that results are suggestive of brexpiprazole procognitive activity in declarative memory, 
object recognition memory, long-term memory even if no explanation was given for the different 
behavior shown by aripiprazole although the 5-HT1A partial agonism and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism 
are shared. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Brexpiprazole was tested for additional activity across a wide spectrum of receptors, ion channels and 
transporters in an in vitro study at a concentration of 10 µM.  The inhibition ratios of Brexpiprazole were 
52.23% to 100.00% for α2-adrenergic (non-selective), β-adrenergic (non-selective), dopamine 
transporter (human), muscarinic (non-selective), muscarinic M1 (human), Na channel site 2,

neurokinin NK1 (human), neurokinin NK2 (human), opiate (non-selective), opiate μ (human), oxytocin, 
serotonin transporter (human), sigma (non-selective), and monoamine oxidase (MAO-B).  
Both aripiprazole and brexpiprazole showed a pattern of effects consistent with an antiimpulsivity 
therapeutic effect in a behavioral paradigm of impulsivity using the Five Choice Serial Reaction Time 
Test (5CSRTT) in rats. The effects were seen at the lower oral doses in the following range used 
aripiprazole at 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg and brexpiprazole at 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg, with higher doses 
resulting in a reduction in responding. Attention and impulsivity are characteristics of several disease 
states including mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia and ADHD. 
Using a recent rat model for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related memory typical feature in 
the anxiety disorder, oral administration of brexpiprazole 0.03-0.3 mg/kg, administered 7 days after 
the fear conditioning, reverses the paradoxical pattern of PTSD-like memory, restoring thereby a 
normal contextual fear memory. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In a battery of safety pharmacology studies, brexpiprazole was evaluated for effects on central nervous 
system (CNS), respiratory system, and cardiovascular system. Brexpiprazole induced dose dependent 
CNS depression and decrease in body temperature at 30 and 100 mg/kg doses, corresponding to an 
AUC0-24 (derived by toxicokinetic data at day 1 in the 4 week rat study 019254) of 3601 and 19928 
ng.h/mL. The NOAEL for CNS effects is 10 mg/kg (AUC0-24 1754 ng.h/mL). Exposure margins (5.0) in 
excess of the human AUC of 3950 ng.h/mL at the maximum human recommended dose (MHRD) of 4 
mg exists only for the higher dose used, therefore brexpiprazole-induced CNS depression effect is likely 
relevant, consistently with what is observed in clinical (depression (8 of 2869 subjects 0.3%) was the 
most frequently occurring serious TEAE in Trial 331-10-238).  
No effect on the respiratory system of rats was seen, when administered up to 30 mg/kg.  
Concerning cardiovascular system there was an effect on human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) 
tail current by brexpiprazole with an IC50 of 0.12 µM, i.e. concentration hundreds of times higher than 
the one reached in patients treated with the brexpirazole MHRD (corresponding to approximately 4 
ng/mL of free brexpiprazole, due to its 98% binding to plasma proteins). In vivo brexpiprazole 
administered orally at 30 mg/kg (Cmax 2048, exposure margin 10) in conscious adult dogs (report 
019648) induced a prolongation of the QT interval and QTc. Moreover, prolonged QT and QTc were also 
observed in monkeys at 10 (Cmax 496.9 ng/mL, exposure margin 2.5) and 30 mg/kg/day (Cmax 1427 
ng/mL, exposure margin 7.2) on Day 1 in the 4- and 13-week repeated dose studies respectively, and 
in the juvenile dog toxicity report at 30 mg/kg, corresponding to brexpiprazole exposure in excess of 
about 10 fold of the clinical exposure at the MHRD. 
The Applicant considers that QT effect may be indirectly associated with the brexpiprazole 
pharmacologically-mediated decrease in body temperature, but no findings of dog lower body 
temperature were recorded by the Study Director of the report 019648. Even though the in vitro and in 
vivo effects are observed at much higher concentration and exposure (approximately 2.4-7.1 fold in 
term of Cmax at which QT prolongation is most closely associated) than those reached in patients 
treated with brexpiprazole MHRD, the effects on QT prolongation associated with brexpiprazole 
administration may be considered to represent a potential risk to patients particularly at dose initiation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 27/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
even in light of available clinical data (Clinical Trial 331-10-242) in which significant signs of QT 
prolongation have been observed in female patients (see Clinical efficacy section). 
No hERG study data has been provided for DM-3411. The relative exposure of DM-3411 has been 
indicated to be 162 ng/ml (Cmax) and 3320 h.ng/ml (AUCt) from the clinical thorough QT study. In 
addition, exposure at the maximum daily dose would result in plasma levels of the parent and 
metabolite well below levels expected to cause an arrhythmogenic effect.   
Brexpiprazole at oral doses >3 mg/kg induced hypotension. The Applicant provided sufficient data 
supporting the hypothesis of decreased blood pressure in dog by blockade of α1-adrenoceptors in 
peripheral blood vessels, as observed with risperidone. This is adequately reflected in SmPC section 5.3. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The current RXULTI application is for approval of brexpiprazole as monotherapy in the treatment of 
schizophrenia. Anyway, concomitant medications are commonly used in schizophrenic patients: e.g. 
antidepressants, anxiolytics. Since pharmacology of brexpiprazole is believed to be mediated by a 
combination of activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors, the potential for pharmacodynamic 
drug-drug interactions is to be considered. In the absence of non-clinical and clinical pharmacodynamic 
drug interaction studies, adequate information on the most commonly concomitant medications sharing 
the same brexpiprazole targets or adverse effects is reflected in the RXULTI SmPC section 4.5. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of brexpiprazole was investigated in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies conducted in mice 
(in vitro only), rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys, including studies of brain concentration for 
brexpiprazole and its metabolites. The PK of the major metabolite DM-3411 (the S-oxide of the 
benzothiophene moiety of brexpiprazole), was also assessed. 
Analytical methods using HPLC with UV detection and LC-ESI-MS/MS were validated to quantify 
concentrations of unlabeled brexpiprazole or the metabolites DM-3411 and other metabolites and 
reference compounds in plasma (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and monkey), in mouse skin homogenate, in 
matrices obtained from in vitro protein binding (ie, mouse, rat, monkey, and human serum and 
dialysate) and from rat hepatic S9 sample mixtures. The LLOQ for brexpiprazole was 1 ng/mL in rat, 
dog, and rabbit plasma, and 0.3 ng/mL in monkey plasma. 
Absorption 
In fed conditions, absorption was dose dependent in male rats and cynomolgus.  
AUC in fed female rats orally administered with 3 mg/kg were 1.50 fold higher than those in the male 
fed rats and feeding (assessed only in male rats) reduced absorption. The absolute bioavailability of 
bexpiprazole in male rat at 1 mg/kg was only 13.6%. In fed conditions in dogs, Cmax and AUC∞ were 
approximately 3.0 to 3.7 times of the values obtained under the fasted conditions. Thus, feeding 
increased the plasma concentration profiles of OPC-34712 after a single oral administration of 30 mg/kg 
to the male beagle dogs. In fed conditions, AUC in male fasted cynolgus orally administered with 3 
mg/kg were higher (1.3 times) than those in the male fed cynomolgus. The absolute bioavailability of 
bexpiprazole in male cynomolgus at 1 mg/kg was only 31%. 
Following oral administration, an approximately linear PK profile was observed in rats and monkeys 
species used in toxicological evaluations. In both rat and monkey a food effect reducing absorption of 
brexpiprazole was observed (differently from the dog). In fed female rats a higher exposure was

observed compared to the male fed rat. In contrast to human bioavailability (95%), brexpiprazole 
showed low bioavailability in rats (13.6%) and monkeys (31%). 
Distribution 
In vitro, brexpiprazole was highly bound to serum protein in all tested species (Mouse, Rat, Rabbit, Dog, 
Monkey, Human). Brexpiprazole was bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein in 
human serum. At brexpiprazole concentration saturating the binding sites (higher than the clinical 
Cmax of 199 ng/ml (clinical tral 331-08-205), digitoxin was able to displace brexpiprazole (6.6-9.1%) 
to serum protein binding; howevr, this extent is not considered clinically relevant. Neither warfarin nor 
diazepam affected brexpiprazole binding to human albumin.  
In vitro, DM-3411 protein binding in the the monkey and human sera was lower than that of 
brexpiprazole.   
In vivo brexpiprazole protein binding in rat and monkey plasma was lower than in vitro protein binding, 
ranging from 91.8% and 94.0% in rat and 93.9% and 95.5% in monkeys; no gender effect in rat and 
no overall time dependency was observed up to 48 hours. From clinical studies, brexpiprazole bound 
human plasma protein to 99%. 
Following oral administration in rats, the concentration of radioactivity in all tissues in female rats 
(except for sex organs) was like that of male rats with radioactivity peak in all tissues 0.5 to 8 hours 
postdose. Concentrations in the CNS were generally lower than in plasma and were quantifiable up to 
24 hr post-dose in males and up to 8 hr post-dose in females. The radioactive concentrations in plasma 
and brain of brexpiprazole and metabolite DM-3411 were higher for collectively housed rats compared 
with individually housed rats. The Applicant attributed this difference in the mean values could be a 
function of the variability introduced by the small number of animals (N = 5) in each group. An uneven 
brexpiprazole distribution pattern was observed: almost no radioactivity was observed in the white 
matter. 
The major metabolite DM-3411 was not detected in rat CNS; since no brain distribution study was 
performed in other species nor in human. It is not possible to exclude a different behaviour of DM-3411 
in CNS. 
In autoradiograpy study, brexpiprazole and/or its metabolites tend to be distributed in the gray matter 
containing the neuronal cells not but the white matter containing the myelinated fiber and 
oligodendrocytes. From these results, there was no evidence on the relationship between the cerebral 
distribution of this drug and the brain lesions (demyelination and necrosis of the oligodendrocytes in the 
neurotoxicity toxicity studies 019906 and 20278).  
Results from pregnant rats indicate that brexpiprazole and its metabolites are transferred into the fetus 
at concentrations that were generally comparable to levels seen in maternal blood. Brexpiprazole and 
its metabolites are excreted into rat breast milk. 
In pigmented rats (Long-Evans) orally administered with a single dose of 3 mg/kg, concentration of 
radioactivity in the skin was higher than those in plasma and non-pigmented skin: although these 
results suggest brexpiprazole has an affinity for melanin, brexpiprazole resulted non-phototoxic in in 
vivo studies in albino and pigmented mice (see Toxicological section).  
Brexpiprazole displays evidence of binding to melanin, with retention to the skin and eyes in several 
animal species.  In addition, in brexpiprazole was photocytotoxic to cultured mammalian cells

(BALB/3T3 cells) in vitro.  There is no evidence of potential phototoxicity related to this enhanced 
retentionanyway brexpiprazole is anticipated to be used chronically with the potential of dose 
accumulation to melanin containing tissues.  Given the absence of toxicological findings the retention to 
skin and eyes may have limited clinical implications.   
The proposed metabolic pathways of brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) in animals and humans is depicted 
below: 
M = mouse, R = rat, D = dog, Rb = rabbit, Mk = monkey, H = human, LS9 = liver 9000  g supernatant (S9) 
fraction. Source:  Reports: 019018, 019521, 019635, 020277, 023749, 023880, 024026, 024102, 024787, 
331-07-201, 331-08-205 and 331-08-206. 
Metabolic fate of brexpiprazole was investigated with in vitro and in vivo studies.  
In rat liver S9 fraction, the S-oxide of the benzothiophene structure of brexpiprazole (DM-3411) 
resulted the most abundant brexpiprazole metabolite across species (mouse, male rat, rabbit, dog, 
monkey, human) except in the famale rat. In human, brexpiprazole was mainly metabolized to 
DM-3411 by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. This was also demonstrated by the fact that in human liver 
microsomes ketoconazole (a known CYP3A4 inhibitor) inhibited the formation of DM-3411 approx. 
70%.  
Brexpiprazole showed a high inhibitory potential to CYP2B6 isoform (Ki=5.01 M) in human liver 
microsomes and a small induction potential to CYP1A2, CYP3A4/5 and CYP3A4 activity in primary 
cultured human hepatocytes.

In conclusion, the biotransformation profiles of brexpiprazole were qualitatively similar across species. 
CYP3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible for metabolism of brexpiprazole in human liver 
microsomes.  
DM-3411 did not significantly inhibit several CYP isoenzyme while no induction potential by DM-3411 
was assessed. 
In vivo 
In dedicated in vivo studies in rat and monkey, DM-3411 was confirmed to be the major metabolites 
across species contributing to 23.6% of the overall administered dose. Based on overall exposure, 
DM-3411 was the most abundant metabolite in plasma from male and female rats with no marked sex 
differences were observed. Being pharmacologically active in rat, monkey and human, DM-3411 was 
fully characterized from the safety point of view (see Toxicological part of this AR). Safety margins of 
DM-3411 based on exposure at NOAELs are consistently below 1, except for male rats in the fertility 
study (3.6-fold), and female rats in the embryo-fetal development (1.7-fold) and carcinogenicity 
(1.6-fold) studies.   
Excretion 
Excretion studies were conducted in rats and monkeys, evaluating the extent of elimination following 
single oral administration of radiolabelled 14C-brexpiprazole. In both female and male rats and male 
monkeys unchanged brexpiprazole was eliminated mainly with feces and excretion was almost 
complete by 168 hr post-dose: in rats >93% of recovered radioactivity was present 168 hours 
post-dose; in monkeys, recovery was lower than in rats at 63% with a greater extent present in urine 
(15%). In male and female bile duct-cannulated rats, more than 71% of radioactivity was present in 
urine and bile. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Brexpiprazole was not an MDR1 substrate but it together with DM-3411 inhibited the digoxin transport 
meditated by MDR1. Brexpiprazole was not a substrate of BCRP transporter but it together with 
DM-3411 inhibited BCRP efflux transporter. However, Results of DDI trials have further confirmed that 
the administration of brexpiprazole had no effect on the MDR1 (Pgp) (fexofenadine used as substrate) 
or BCRP transporters (rosuvastatin used as substrate). Both Brexpiprazole and DM-3411 slightly 
inhibited BSEP.  
Brexpiprazole is not a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1 transporters. Brexpiprazole and 
DM-3411 inhibited OATP1B1, OCT2, and OCT1. Brexpiprazole showed no inhibition of OAT1 and 
OAT3-mediated transport and DM-3411 has weak inhibitory potency for OAT1 and OAT3-mediated 
transport. Brexpiprazole and DM-3411 showed no inhibition of OATP1B3-mediated transport.  
Brexpiprazole and DM-3411 had an inhibitory potency against the MATE1- and MATE2-K. 
Overall, based on the results from in vitro CYP, transporter studies, and clinical DDI studies, the 
potential for brexpiprazole or DM-3411 to produce systemic drug-drug interactions appears minimal. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Rats and cynomolgus monkeys were used in general dose-repeat toxicity studies. They are considered 
relevant species for assessment of human safety due to presence of the pharmacological target, and 
comparable metabolic profile with humans, although the very low exposure reached in monkeys is 
acknowledged.

Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity of brexpiprazole was tested in rats and monkeys by oral and i.v. administration up to 
2000 mg/kg. The Approximate Lethal Dose in male and female rats was >2000 and >800 mg/kg 
respectively by the oral route and >1.2 mg/kg by i.v. route. In monkeys, the ALD was >100 mg/kg by 
oral route and > 0.56 mg/kg by i.v. route. 
Behavioural signs observed in these studies were consisted of CNS effects (hypoactivity, closed eyes, 
and abnormal postures) and hypothermia. 
In 13-week (pre-carcinogenicity) repeated dose toxicity in mice orally administered, no target organs 
was identified, decrease in body weight with a remarkable decrease in food consumption, incomplete 
eyelid closure, staggering gait and creeping, were observed. These changes did not differ from those 
observed in rats and monkeys.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose oral toxicity evaluations in rat included studies of 1 and4-week (non-pivotal) and 13 
(+4-week recovery), and 26 (+13-week recovery) week duration. In the 1-week study doses were 300 
and 1000 mg/kg/day, in the 4-week study, doses were 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day, in the 13-week 
study the doses were 30, 100, 300 (M)/10, 30, 100 (F) mg/kg/day, and in the 26-week study the doses 
were 3, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day. In all studies, there was a largely consistent pattern of observations 
including decreases in body weight gain and food consumption, incomplete eyelid closure, hypoactivity, 
lacrimation, creeping, staggering gait, poor physical condition (consistent with the depression of CNS as 
the brexpiprazole pharmacodynamic effects), hyperreactivity and aggressiveness that might be 
excessive adaptive-responses to the brexpiprazole-induced depression of CNS.  
Flaccidity and dilatation of the scrotum in male rats during 26-week study have been attributed by the 
Applicant to brexpiprazole activity on dopaminergic receptors as the same effects were reported in the 
rats 12-month repeated oral dose toxicity study of perospirone, another atypical antipsychotic (Yamada 
T. “Twelve-month repeated oral toxicity report of SM-9018 in rats.” CLINICAL REPORT - Basic and 
Clinical Report).  
Although the causes of male reproductive organs alterations were not definitively discussed, the effect 
on scrotum seems not to be clinically relevant, since it was not observed in monkeys nor in humans and 
no impairment of male reproductive function were detected. 
Clonic convulsions occurred at exposure in term of AUC0-24 of about 11 fold higher than that reached in 
patients receiving the MHRD of 4 mg/kg of brexpiprazole. Clonic convulsion seems to depend more on 
the duration of treatment than on the amount of exposure. In fact, this effect has not been observed in 
rats treated for 13 weeks at a dose of 100 mg/kg/d corresponding to exposure about 15 times higher 
than that reaches at the MHRD. In clinical long-term controlled Trial 331-10-232, there were no reports 
of TEAEs associated with seizure in any treatment group during the Double-blind Maintenance phase of 
Trial, but during the Stabilization Phase, convulsion was reported in 1 subject, who was treated with 
brexpiprazole 4 mg/day: the event resolved and the subject continued the trial. Therefore, clonic 
convulsion although no longer present during the recovery phase of the report, is judged to be a toxic 
change in rats due to brexpiprazole exposure. Clonic convulsion/seizure is regarded as a dopamine 
underactivity condition mediated by dopamine antagonist agents (Starr, 1996). "Seizure" is considered 
a potential risk for humans in the RXULTI RMP and adequate warning in SmPC section 4.4 is included for 
patients who have a history of seizure disorders or have conditions associated with seizure.  
Haematology and clinical chemistry changes induced by brexpiprazole are considered not toxicologically 
relevant due to their sporadic nature, the absence of a doseresponse relationship, small magnitude of 
change, almost total reversibility, and possible association with decreased food consumption and body 
weight or stress and absence in monkeys and in humans.

Brain lesions were observed in rats at brexpiprazole exposures about 29 and 7 fold higher for males and 
females respectively, than the exposure in patients receiving the MHRD. The lesion included necrosis of 
oligodendrocytes, demyelination, and vacuolation of white matter or gray matter, chromatolysis of 
neurons; necrosis of granule cells in olfactory bulb; and necrosis of Purkinje cells. The incidence of these 
lesions was low and these lesions were observed primarily in rats which had severe hypothermia, died 
or were moribund (i.e., a time-dependent change could not be demonstrated). Besides findings in the 
rats, chromatolysis of neurons was also observed in non-human primates; however the finding was only 
noted in the moribund animals and was considered secondary to poor food consumption, deteriorating 
condition and once again low body temperature.  The Applicant hypothesis that brain lesions (necrosis 
of oligodendrocytes, demyelination, and vacuolation of white matter or gray matter, chromatolysis of 
neurons; necrosis of granule cells in olfactory bulb; necrosis of Purkinje cells) observed in rat and 
monkey are related to hypothermia is shared. Indeed, when alleviation of hypothermia was reached 
through group housing (5 rats per polycarbonate cage with paper pulp bedding) prevention of brain 
lesions were observed. Finally, the cause of histopathologic lesions in the brain was considered to be 
pharmacologically-induced hypothermia, rather than a direct toxic effect of brexpiprazole. 
Thermogenesis is under direct control of the CNS, and an effect on thermogenesis (such as hypothermia) 
has been observed with other centrally-acting drugs. In the SmPC it is reported the disruption of the 
body’s ability to reduce core body temperature. In the All Phase (1/2/3) Brexpiprazole Trials Safety 
Sample one TEAE of hypothermia (1/7897, 0.01%)   occurred. This adverse event of hypothermia 
occurred in a, enrolled in Trial 331-13-214, evaluating brexpiprazole as an adjunctive therapy in MDD. 
The subject was on brexpiprazole 2 mg plus venlafaxine. The non serious adverse event of hypothermia 
occurred 21 days after the last brexpiprazole dose. The outcome of the event was reported as not 
recovered. Review of the vital signs during the trial did not provide any abnormality for body 
temperature (baseline 36.2°C; lowest value at Week 14: 35.9°C on 17 Mar 2016). The investigator 
assessed the event as mild and not related to the investigational medicinal product. Thus, the 
non-clinical observation of brain lesions in rat and monkey attributed by the Applicant to hypothermia 
apparently does not find a correlation in clinical experience up to now. Anyway, temperature regulation 
disorder (e.g. hypothermia, pyrexia) is reported in the table of ADRs (frequency not known) in RXULTI 
section 4.4 SmPC risk of hyperthermia, is indicated in the SmPC section 4.4 under "Neuroleptic 
Malignant Syndrome (NMS)" and "Body temperature regulation" headings.  
In conclusion, since available data do not allow to rule out a possible association between hypothermia 
and brexpiprazole administration, hypothermia should be monitored in upcoming PSURs. 
Spermatogenesis, hypertrophy of corpus luteum, uterus atrophy and mucification, increased ovary 
weights and increased incidence of lobular hyperplasia with secretion of milk in the mammary gland 
(pseudopregnancy) and femminization of mammary gland in males observed at high doses, are 
considered consequences of drug-related pharmacologically mediated hyperprolactinemia. 
In the 13 week rat study focal myocardial necrosis was observed in controls (4), 3 mg/kg/day (4), 10 
mg/kg/day (4), 100 mg/kg/day (8) and the 300 mg/kg/day (6) groups. After a 4 week recovery period 
focal myocardial necrosis was seen in the control (1) and at 300 mg/kg/day (2), and focal myocardial 
fibrosis, an anatomic repair-finding to myocardial necrosis, in the control (1) and at 300 mg/kg/day (4).  
According to the literature this finding is commonly found as a spontaneous lesion in the rat with limited 
implications for humans.  There does not appear to be a dose-related event and there is increased 
incidence in the brexpiprazole treated animals, although it is agreed that this is not to a great extent.

The toxicological meaning of deposition of pigment granules observed in many organs of male and 
female rats at exposures in term of AUC0-24 3-fold higher that corresponding to the MRHD, could not be 
definitively clarified, but the relevance of this finding to humans is not certain. 
Most changes observed during the dosing phase of 13- and 26-week studies in rats resolved during the 
4 week recovery periods, except the pigment granules deposition for the adrenal, thyroid, and ovary ah 
the highest doses.  
Repeat dose oral toxicity evaluations in monkey included studies of 2- and 4-week (non pivotal) and 13 
(+4 week recovery), 39-week duration. In the 2-week supplementary study performed to calculate the 
NOEL value, the doses were 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg/day, in the 4-week study the doses were 3, 10, and 30 
mg/kg/day, in the 13- and 39-week studies the doses were 1, 3 and 30 mg/kg/day, while. Similar to 
studies in the rat, there was a largely consistent pattern of observations linked to brexipirazole 
pharmacodynamics. Unlike the rat, tremors, limited to the extremities in 4- and 13-week studies and 
whole body tremors in the 39-week studies, were observed. The Applicant considered tremors of 
extremities not toxicologically significant since similar signs were also observed during the pre-test 
phase ECG in 9/16 animals/sex, and whole body tremors an adaptive response to cold due to reduction 
of body temperature consistent with the pharmacology of brexpiprazole. However, this explanation 
does not originate by the conclusion of Study Director of the 39-week study, in which the observed 
whole body tremors was not explained and the tremors observed at the low dose were judged incidental. 
Tremors are not considered mediated by pharmacological CNS depression. The whole tremors are 
present at exposures even lower than those observed in patient receiving the therapeutic dose of 
brexpiprazole, and they are not reversible in females monkeys dosed at exposure 1.3 fold higher that 
reached in patients. Tremors are one of the signs of tardive diskinesia associated with long-term use of 
antidopaminergic agents characterised by irreversibility after removal of the antidopaminergic agent 
(Ure et al., 2016). This is likely mediated by sensitisation of D2 recepotors. In pharmacodynamic study 
020354, repeated administration of 6 mg/kg brexpiprazole showed at least a comparable potential to 
enhance sensitivity of postsynaptic D2 receptors than haloperidol.  Whole body tremors observed in 
39-week toxicity study in monkeys are considered as an acute pharmacological effect rather than a late 
effect due to prolonged D2 blockade such as tardive dyskinesia. The partial agonist feature of 
brexpiprazole makes its safety profile different from that of antipsychotic agents known to cause tardive 
dyskinesia. However, the lower intrinsic activity of brexpiprazole at D2 receptors than aripiprazole 
(relative to dopamine -Emax, %- 40% vs 60%) makes brexpiprazole a step closer to D2 antagonism on 
the agonist-antagonist spectrum. 
Atrophy of the thymus, adrenals and spleen observed at high doses were considered to be associated 
with a stress response. The etiology of hyperemia of the oral mucosa was not further discussed by the 
Applicant, but the presence only in 13-week report at 2.5 x exposure margins in term of clinical 
exposure and the full recovery, allows to consider this finding of uncertain nature and not clinically 
relevant. 
In 39 weeks study at Day 273 TK values at 30 mg/kg/day were lower than those observed on Day 1 or 
Day 91, and the decline was as much 60% lower, e.g., in females.  The Applicant cannot confirm on the 
basis of TK/NOAEL obtained in repeated-dose toxicity studies, that the monkey is the non-rodent 
relevant animal species for toxicity extrapolation to human. The absence of margins of exposure, 
especially in monkey is due to the fact that brexpiprazole toxicity observed in mice, rats and monkeys 
was mainly related to its exaggerated pharmacological activity (e.g. hypoactivity, hypothermia or 
hyperprolactinemia). The lower exposure seen in female monkeys at 30 mg/kg/day on Day 273 in 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 34/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
39-weeks monkey study, was justified due to high variability in the measured plasma concentrations 
coming from only 2 animals. 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of brexpiprazole was investigated in a bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay, 
an in vitro mammalian mutagenicity assay in L5178Y tk+/- Mouse Lymphoma cells and two in vivo rat 
bone marrow micronucleus tests with a two day exposure period and in unscheduled DNA Synthesis 
Test. The Applicant conclusion is that brexpiprazole was weakly genotoxic at cytotoxic doses in the in 
vitro mammalian cell reports, however since brexpiprazole was negative in the bacterial reverse 
mutation test and in the in vivo genotoxicity tests (bone marrow micronucleus, in vivo/in vitro 
unscheduled DNA synthesis) no mutagenic potentials emerged. It is therefore considered that the 
available evidence from genotoxicity investigations are affected by some uncertainties. With regard to 
the Unscheduled DNA Synthesis, in fact it is considered a test with scarcely sensitivity. With regard to 
the micronucleus in vivo test on bone marrow, the Applicant clarified that the highest doses used in the 
in vivo micronucleus test (2000 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg in male and female rat, respectively) were 
selected on the basis of previous toxicity studies i.e. single dose toxicity study 018982 and the 
non-pivotal repeated dose toxicity study 019075, in which unfortunately no TK analysis was performed. 
Athough no toxicity sign at the bone marrow has been descripted in the in vivo micronucleus test, the 
highest doses used in this genotoxicity study were much higher than doses used in pivotal repeated 
toxicity studies in rat (e.g. 300 mg/kg in male, and 100 mg/kg in female) for which systemic exposure 
was reached. Since the bone marrow is a well perfused tissue it is asssumed that brexpiprazole 
exposure to the bone marrow was reached.  
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of brexpiprazole was studied in CD-1 mice at doses of 0.75, 2 or 5 
mg/kg/day and in SD rats at doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg/day in males and 3, 10 or 30 in females. In mice 
at the highest dose, systemic exposure attained a 3.1x and 1.1x multiple of human therapeutic 
exposure in male and female mice, respectively in term of AUC. In rats exposure multiples of 1.0x and 
4.4x were achieved in the high dose males and females, respectively in term of AUC. At the maximum 
dose, in male and female mice, exposure at steady state was approximately 3.1x and 1.1x, respectively, 
the human exposure associated with 4 mg brexipriprazole (3950 ng.h/mL). Although the proposed 
safety margin for mice and rat carcinogenicity is quite low, both assays are considered overall adequate. 
In both cases the doses were recommended by the FDA CDER's Executive Carcinogenicity Assessment 
Committee. In mice the 0.75, 2, and 5 mg/kg doses used are based on mortality in both sexes and the 
excessive decrease in body weight in males at doses >10 mg/kg observed in the 13-week subchronic 
toxicity reports and the exposure to parent brexpiprazole and its main metabolite during the report 
period was confirmed in TK groups. In rats the MTD was achieved as decreased body weight gain 
associated with decreased food consumption was observed in high dose groups (the final body weigh 
was lower by 19% in high dose -males and by -13% at medium dose and -28% in high dose females). 
Survival was unaffected by brexpiprazole treatment. 
In CD 1 mice daily oral gavage administration of brexpiprazole to male up to 91 weeks and to female up 
to 98 weeks at dosages of 0.75, 2 and 5 mg/kg/day, revealed no notable changes in tumorigenic 
potency in males, but revealed degenerative changes in mammary glands and pituitary in females 
given >0.75 mg/kg/day without dose related difference. The Applicant's current hypothesis of the 
pathophysiologic mode of female mammary gland and pituitary carcinogenesis is that brexpiprazole 
induces a cascade of non-genotoxic events initiated by brexpiprazole dopamine "D2 antagonistic effect" 
that block dopaminergic receptors promoting prolactin secretion. This hypothesis is mainly based on 
results of two additional studies showing that brexpiprazole has a potency to increase the serum 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 35/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prolactin levels in male and female rats with a single oral administration of the compound at 100 mg/kg 
for the males and 30 mg/kg for the females, and in the female and male mice with at 5 mg/kg, with 
potency judged to be weaker in the males when compared to that of the females in both species. The 
more remarkable serum prolactin levels of the females than those of the males are reflected in the 
results of the CD-1 mice carcinogenicity assay. Antipsychotic agents are demonstrated to promote the 
secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland by their blocking action on the dopaminergic receptors in 
mice (Xu et al., 2002), supporting the Applicant argumentation that brexpiprazole had a potency to 
increase the serum prolactin levels through dopamine "D2 antagonist effect" in mice. It should be of 
note that increased mortality associated with the occurrence and incidence of mammary tumour and 
pituitary gland tumour only in mice and not in rats was also reported for another "D2 partial agonist" 
[“In mice, dietary administration of aripiprazole at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day for 104 weeks was 
associated with increased incidences of mammary tumours, namely adenocarcinomas 
/adenoacanthomas and pituitary adenomas in females at the mid- and high doses. Increases in 
mammary and pituitary neoplasms as well as other drug-related mammary/reproductive tissue 
alterations in females were considered, by the applicant, likely to be secondary to aripiprazole-related 
increases in serum prolactin” Abilify EPAR EMA]. 
On these bases the hyperprolactinemia hypothesis for mice female tumours is considered plausible 
taking also into account that no pattern of change was observed for other hormones linked to mammary 
tumours.  Hyperprolactinaemia is not rodent-specific: prolactin related effects are seen across studies 
and in all species.   
Regarding  the  in  vitro  findings  for  brexpiprazole  and  its  metabolite,  DM-3411,  and  D2  antagonistic 
activity,  the  applicant  confirms  that  these  antagonistic  effects  may  contribute  to  findings  of 
hyperprolactinaemia.    Hyperprolactinaemia  and  related  disorders,  has  been  raised  as  an  important 
potential risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).   
The  role  of  prolactin  in  human  breast  tumours  remains  unsettled.  Several  studies  have  linked 
hyperprolactinemia to an increased risk of breast  cancer  (Halbreicht et  al.,  2003; Hankinson  et al., 
1999). Several epidemiological studies have investigated whether female psychiatric patients receiving 
antipsychotics have a higher incidence of breast cancer, with conflicting results. However, the study 
performed with the most strong methodology (retrospective cohort design and comparison between 
women  who  were  exposed  to  antipsychotics  with  age-matched  women)  found  that  antipsychotic 
dopamine receptor antagonist conferred a small but significant risk of breast cancer (Wang et al., 2002). 
Conversely,  other  studies  (Cohen  et  al.,  2000;  Mandalà  et  al.,  2002)  have  shown  no  correlation 
between  hyperprolactinemia  and  breast  cancer.  Therefore,  at  this  time  we  have  no  definitive  data 
suggesting increased risk of breast cancer secondary to hyperpolactinemia caused by antipsychotics, 
and  further  prospective  studies  with  large  number  of  patients  are  considered  desirable  in  this  area 
before a definitive answer can be provided (Vyas, 2012). The same author recommends detection of 
existing  mammary  tumours  before  examination  or  studies  (mammogram)  prior  administration  of 
neuroleptics.  In  light  of  current  knowledge,  the  induction  of  mammary  neoplastic  lesions  by 
hyperprolactinemia cannot yet be considered definitively an exclusive ‘rodent-specific’ phenomenon as 
stated by the sponsor Available clinical data derived  only by short-term trials, showed that median 
prolactin  values  increased  from  baseline  in  the  brexpiprazole  2  to  4  mg/day  group  and  were  more 
pronounced in females compared with males and in general the increase in prolactin was not associated 
with an adverse clinical outcome (i.e., AEs potentially related to prolactin elevation). 
The NOAEL for mice tumorigenicity was not determined for female i.e. no margin exists for female, and 
considered 5 mg/kg/day for male mice at this dose level the AUC0-24 is 12430 ng.h/mL, corresponding 
to a margin of exposure of 3.1.

In SD rats no brexpiprazole related neoplastic lesions were observed up to 10 mg/kg/day (M) and 30 
mg/kg/day (F) administered for 104 weeks. 
Regarding non neoplastic lesions, yellowish brown pigments in cortical cells and macrophages in the 
adrenals were observed in the 26-week repeated oral dose toxicity report and these pigments were 
considered to lipofuscin. Although the deposition of yellowish brown pigment in cortical cells and 
macrophages is a spontaneous change observed in aged rats, the mechanism of pigment deposition 
was unclear. In lungs, white focus represented alveolar foamy cells in histopathological examination 
and severe changes were observed only in the high dose group. Similar changes were reported in the 
26-week repeated oral dose toxicity study but the causes of these changes were not clarified. Atrophy 
of the pituitary pars intermedia observed also the 26-repeated oral dose toxicity report was considered 
to be pharmacologically mediated and secondary to the D2 partial agonistic activity of brexpiprazole as 
a D2 agonist, bromocriptine, reduced the number of cell layers of the pituitary pars intermedia 
(supporting publication provided). Also, the finding has little or no relevance to humans since humans 
have no distinct pars intermedia. 
Retinal changes observed in carcinogenicty rat assay were considered by the Applicant “to be a 
spontaneous change observed in aged rats and there were no clear differences in the incidence or 
severity of retinal atrophy among the animals that were sacrificed as scheduled, it is considered to be 
related to the increase in survival rate in females and not related to administration of the test article”. 
Bilateral retinal degeneration was also observed in rat carcinogenicity reports with aripiprazole 
attributed to the greater lifetime exposure to light due to a higher survival rate in these groups. On 
these bases retina effects is not considered related to the pharmacological profile of brexpiprazole or 
aripiprazole. Although statistically significant, non-neoplastic and retinal changes observed in 
carcinogenicity rat assay were considered to be of limited toxicological significance. The Applicant 
presented historical data on retinal atrophy up to 2012 of the test facility Gotemba Laboratory in which 
brexpiprazole rat carcinogenicity study was performed. The incidences of retinal atrophy observed with 
brexpiprazole were within the range of the incidence of spontaneous lesions observed in the historical 
control database and the apparent increase in the incidence of retinal atrophy in the brexpiprazole 
treated groups reflects the increased survival of animals in the treated groups, especially females, and 
is not of toxicological significance. 
The NOEL for tumorigenicity in the rat was determined to be 10 and 30 mg/kg/day for male and female 
respectively; at this dose level the AUC 0-24 is 3912 ng.h/mL for male and 17409 ng.h/mL for female, 
corresponding to a margin of exposure of 1.0 and 4.4, respectively. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In the rat fertility and early embryonic developmental toxicity study, male fertility was 
unaffected up to 100 mg/kg, but male fertility end-point effects/test effects were noted in the general 
toxicology studies and dog juvenile toxicology study. Prolonged estrus and decreased fertility 
(pregnancy rate of 80.0% and 78.9%, respectively, as compared with 95.0% in controls) at 3 and 30 
mg/kg (4.1 exposure margins in term of AUC) were observed in female rats, as well as increased 
pre-implantation losses at 30 mg/kg (17.7% vs 3.0% in control 3.0%). These findings are likely to be 
related to the increase serum prolactin induced by brexpiprazole. 
The NOAEL for female rat reproduction was 0.3 mg/kg/day (, 0.3 exposure margins in terms of AUC). 
In the preliminary rat embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study, the high dose, 100 
mg/kg/day, was clearly shown to be (above) the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), since only 1 litter 
remained for investigation due to maternal mortality in 3 dams and complete litter loss in 3 dams. Two 
related skeletal malformations were observed at this high dose level; namely cervical vertebrae, 
absence of vertebral arch and deformed vertebral arch were seen in one fetus (R7) in one litter (F10027) 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 37/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with no observations in controls or other dose groups. Since the incidence is low and seen at a dose level 
at or above the MTD, the findings should be interpreted with caution. One visceral malformation 
(ventricular septum defect in one fetus) was also observed at 30 mg/kg/day with no observations in the 
control group.  
In the pivotal rat embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study, ventricular septum defect was 
observed in 2 control fetuses (from 2 litters) and in 1 fetus at the highest dose tested 30 mg/kg/day. 
Based on the incidence of the findings in the control group, the observation is considered likely 
incidental. The fact that litters only from the control and only the high dose group (30 mg/kg/day), is 
consistent with ICH S5. Moreover, data from the pilot study show that at lower doses (10 mg/kg) no 
obvious signs of teratogenic effects.  The lack of TK data in pregnant rats is considered a weakness in 
the evaluation especially since pregnant rats seem more sensitive to brexpiprazole toxicity than 
non-pregnant females as the NOAEL for general toxicity in female rats was 10 mg/kg/day (hypoactivity 
and closed eye) in the 13- and 26-week repeat dose studies, while being 3 mg/kg/day in the pivotal 
embryo-foetal development study.  
Anyway, limited differences in distribution of radiolabelled brexpiprazole in pregnant and non-pregnant 
rats was observed, being the only difference distribution to the submaxillary gland in pregnant animals, 
which may not be of toxicological significance.  
Data from the preliminary and pivotal studies suggest a steep dose-toxicity response relationship, as 
about a doubling of the estimated exposure at a well-tolerated dose, resulted in high maternal toxicity. 
Overall, it is agreed that no clear signs of fetal malformations were observed in brexpiprazole-treated 
animals when tested up to the approximate clinical AUC exposure (estimation based on TK data in 
non-pregnant rats).   
The NOAEL for rat general toxicity in dams is considered 3 mg/kg/day, for reproductive effects in dams 
and embryo-foetal development is considered to be 30 mg/kg/day. 
In the preliminary rabbit embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study there appeared to be a 
decrease in implants at 100 and 150 mg/kg, an increase in preimplantation and slight decrease in live 
foetuses (although not statistically significant) at both these doses. At 150 mg/kg/day microphthalmia 
in one fetus and narrowed aortic arch in two fetus were observed. This was not seen in control. Thymic 
remnant was seen in the neck in 3 animals at 150 mg/kg and in 1 control. Eigth lumbar vertebrae were 
seen in 7 controls and 16 animals at 150 mg/kg/day. Fused sternebrae was seen at 3 at 150 mg/kg/day: 
these findings were not seen in controls.  
In the pivotal rabbit embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study no effect on foetal viability was 
observed at any dose (10, 30, or 150 mg/kg/day). Foetus malformations were seen only at the highest 
dose 150 mg/kg (~16-fold the clinical AUC): vertebral malformations were noted in 3 fetuses from 2 
litters. These skeletal malformations although seen at a low incidence were not observed in the control 
group and their incidences are outside the historical control data of the test facility and of that reported 
in the literature. In addition, the incidence of the visceral malformation (absence of gall bladder) seen 
in 2 foetuses of 1 litter is also outside the historical control data and literature data. 
The NOAEL for rabbit general toxicity in dams is considered 10 mg/kg/day, for reproductive effects in 
dams and embryo-foetal development is considered to be 30 mg/kg/day. 
In rat pre- and postnatal toxicity study brexpiprazole caused neonatal toxicity (delayed growth and 
physical development and impaired viability) at a dose level inducing maternal toxicity (3 mg/kg/day), 
including impaired nursing behaviour. Foetus and milk transfer of [14C]-brexpiprazole after 
administration to rats was demonstrated.

The RMP was satisfactorily updated as regards the non-clinical safety findings on 
reproductive/developmental toxicity and their relevance to the use in humans. 
Other toxicity studies 
Brexpiprazole does not pose risk for irritancy and haemolytic potential. 
Brexpiprazole did not exert any effects on the sheep red blood cells -specific antibody response in rats 
under up to 30 mg/kg /day administered once daily for 4 weeks. Moreover, weight of evidence 
demonstrates that brexpiprazole is not immunotoxic in the species used in the preclinical studies and 
therefore is not considered to have an immunotoxic potential in humans under the conditions of 
therapeutic use. 
The calculations provided by the Applicant for class 2 Drug Substance impurity is agreed and the 
proposed specification provides safety margins in excess of unity. It has been identified that impurity is 
non-genotoxic following the conduct of QSAR analysis (DEREK NEXUS and Leadscope methods).  The 
impurity is present at levels below ICH Q3A levels for qualification.  
The specified impurities were tested for genotoxic properties in bacterial reverse mutation assay 
providing negative results ..  
The negative result in the two appropriate in vivo phototoxicity report supersedes the positive in vitro 
result. Therefore, brexpiprazole was not considered to be phototoxic. 
As regard the abuse liability/potential, brexpiprazole was considered to possess discriminative stimulus 
effects in rats but no withdrawal signs suggestive of physical dependence production were evident in 
rats, nor reinforcing effect in the i.v. self-administration experiment in rhesus monkeys. No withdrawal 
signs were recorded in the recovery periods of the rat and monkey repeated dose toxicity studies.

Brexpiprazole is very persistent and very bioaccumulative, but not toxic substance: possible enrichment 
of brexpiprazole in terrestrial food chains might pose a concern; this is reflected in section 5.3 and 6.6 
of the SmPC.  
Post-approval, the PECsediment and PECsoil will be calculated using the adsorption data (Koc) in soil 
from the OECD 106 study and the SimpleTreat model described in the European Union System for the 
Evaluation of Substances (EUSES). Revised risk assessments will be provided for the sediment dwelling 
organism study and the terrestrial effects studies. An updated ERA report will then be submitted with 
the revised risk assessments.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: The Applicant should perform an OECD 106 
study to determine the adsorption of brexpiprazole in three soils and the re-evaluate the ERA once 
completed.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712, OPC-331, and Lu AF41156) is intended to treat schizophrenia in adult 
patients. Dopamine overactivity is traditionally considered as the main cause in the occurrence of 
psychotic disorders and it can be pre-synaptic (an excess of dopamine release from dopaminergic nerve 
terminals) or postsynaptic (an increase in the density of D2 receptors or an increase in post-receptor 
action). 
The pharmacological in vitro and in vivo profile of brexpiprazole is mediated by a combination of high 
binding affinity and functional activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors and is qualitatively very 
similar to aripiprazole (Abilify, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and from the same MAH of 
Rxulti): their common denominator is their partial antagonism at 5HT2A and D2 receptors with high 
5HT2A/D2 affinity ratios (both for human 1.6 and rat 1.1 receptors). They can activate D2 receptors, 
but they can also dampen the action of the endogenous transmitter dopamine on D2 receptors; this 
dampening of dopamine is directly proportional their intrinsic activity.  
Brexpiprazole showed a high binding affinity (Ki) for human cloned receptors: 5HT1A (0.12-0.15 nM) > 
alpha1B (0.17 nM) > D2L (0.3 nM) > 5HT2A (0.47 nM) > alpha2C (0.59-1.0 nM), D3 (1.1 Nm) and 
showed antagonistic potency (IC50) towards: alpha1B (0.66 nM) > alpha1A (5.0 nM) > 5HT2A (6.5 
nM). 
In terms of intrinsic activity, brexpiprazole showed a lower Emax than aripiprazole to D2L (40 vs 60 nM) 
and D3 (15 vs 28 nM) receptors and, in a lesser extent, to 5HT1A (60 vs 73 nM).  
The lower intrinsic activity at D2/D3 receptors makes brexpiprazole a step closer to D2 antagonism on 
the agonist-antagonist spectrum. 
Brexpiprazole showed a moderate binding affinity to H1 receptor on which acted as a moderate 
antagonism. 
Along with less intrinsic activity to D2, D3 and 5HT1A receptors, affinity (Ki) and potency (ED50) were 
overall higher compared with aripiprazole; this accounts for in vivo lower effective doses respect to 
aripiprazole. 
It should be noted that for the functional characterization, the GTPγS binding assay is the most reliable 
functional test for G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) since it reflects events close to the receptor and 
so results are not subject to strong amplification unlike other more downstream assays for GPCRs, for 
example, inhibition of cAMP which results may be higher as compared with corresponding values in 
GTPγS binding assays (Payne et al., 2002). Unfortunately, this endpoint was only used in brexpiprazole 
functional assays on 5HT receptors thus no sound comparison could be done across brexpiprazole 
functionality on the different receptors tested.  
Brexpiprazole was able to inhibit human dopamine (90%) and serotonin (65%) efflux transporters. 
Brexpiprazole major human metabolite DM-3411 displayed affinity for several human receptors 
although in a lower extent than the parent compound. Regarding its functionality, DM-3411 was a 
weaker partial agonist (Emax 22%) on 5HT1A vs brexpiprazole and differently from brexpiprazole at D2 
Short and D3 receptors. DM-3411 acted as antagonists with potencies of 4.1 nM and 38 nM, 
respectively. It should be noted that antagonism at D2S (mainly auto-receptors) increases 
dopaminergic release. The contribution of DM-3411 to the clinical outcome of brexpiprazole as full 
dopaminergic antagonist cannot be excluded. 
Differently from brexpiprazole, DM-3411 had no effect (agonist or antagonist) for 5HT2A receptor 
although it bound highly to it. DM-3411 showed a much lower ability than brexpiprazole in inhibit the 
human dopamine transporter (50% vs 90%) and similar ability to bind serotonin transporter (approx 
65%).  
Other minor metabolites (OPC-54050, DM-3404HCL, DM-3412, DM-3413) had a great affinity to human 
D2 receptors with Ki < 0.6 nM.

In rat brain the brexpiprazole receptor occupancy profile mirrored the in vitro rat binding affinity except 
for 5HT2A receptor for which the in vivo (cortex) occupancy was higher than the in vitro binding affinity. 
Following oral administration a time-dependent brexpiprazole binding was observed with 90% maximal 
occupancy at 5HT1A, 75% to 80% maximum occupancy to D2, and more moderate occupancy 
(maximal at 56 and 41%) at both 5HT7 receptors and SERT. Exposure was strongly correlated to 
receptor occupancies differently from aripiprazole: about 50% of D2 and 5HT2A receptors were 
occupied at plasma concentrations reached with oral doses lower than 5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg is the 
brexpiprazole EC50 for classical behavioural experiments for D2 antagonist antipsychotics). 
Results from microdialysis in orally administered rats showed no effect on basal extracellular 
norepinephrine and serotonin. The moderate increase in extracellular dopamine and its metabolites 
3,4-dihydrox-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) was between the increase 
produced by aripiprazole and the full D2 antagonist olanzapine. This confirms the in vitro brexpiprazole 
D2 partial agonism. The dose-dependent extracellular histamine level increase observed may be likely 
mediated by brexpiprazole histamine H1 antagonism. 
Electrophysiological studies in rats dosed IV with brexpiprazole and in some cases or aripiprazole, 
further confirmed the in vitro brexpiprazole multimodal activity on D2 and 5HT receptors: at D2 
presynaptic areas (auto-receptors) brexpiprazole showed a slightly lower agonistic activity than 
aripiprazole. 
In addition, the postsynaptic 5HT2A antagonistic action in vivo was confirmed with the ability of 
brexpiprazole to inhibit the 5HT2A/2C receptor agonist (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine 
(DOI)-induced head twitch. 
In male rats brexpiprazole was able to significantly decrease serum hyperprolactinemia induced by 
reserpine only at low oral dose of 3 mg/kg: with brexpiprazole at 10 and 30 mg/kg no difference from 
reserpine hyperprolactinemia control value was observed. On the contrary, all doses of the D2 receptor 
antagonist risperidone further increased prolactin levels. It should be noted that in toxicity study 
brexpiprazole increased the serum prolactin levels in both male and female rats following a single oral 
administration at 100 mg/kg for males and 30 mg/kg for females about 7- and 99-fold than the control 
after 1 hour after administration. Notwithstanding its partial agonism, the ability to increase serum 
prolactin levels was also observed in clinical trials. The lower intrinsinc activity as D2 agonist respect 
aripiprazole, which makes brexpiprazole a step closer to D2 antagonism, could be responsible to this 
effect. 
In a series of behavioural studies in rats, single oral administrations of brexpiprazole was able to: 
-  
induce catalepsy and, to a less extent, ptosis responses (which are considered as animal models 
reflecting  
the extrapyramidal symptoms and sedation) only at high doses;  
-  
-  
-  
inhibit the conditioned avoidance response; 
inhibit the apomorphine (APO)-induced hyperlocomotion; 
inhibit APO-induced stereotyped behavior. 
In all the above mentioned studies the effect of brexpiprazole mediated by postsynaptic D2 receptor 
antagonism was stronger than aripiprazole, weaker than haloperidol and almost comparable to atypical 
antipsychotics, olanzapine and risperidone. These results account for a lower intrinsic activity of 
brexpiprazole to D2receptors.  
In short term controlled trials 2-4 mg brexpiprazole showed a higher rate of sedation than placebo and 
extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)-related TEAEs (mainly driven by akathisia events) higher than placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 43/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were observed only for 4 mg. Both akathisia and sedation are reported as common adverse drug 
reactions in SmPC section 4.8 and EPS is listed as important identified risk in the RMP and it is the only 
one also supported by non-clinical data.  
Single oral doses of brexpiprazole were able to inhibit APO-induced eye blinking in monkeys. This result 
indicates that brexpiprazole has a D2 receptor antagonistic action in cynomolgus monkeys.  
Repeated administration (3 week) in rats of oral doses of brexpiprazole equivalent to haloperidol 
showed at least a comparable potential to enhance sensitivity of postsynaptic D2 receptors than 
haloperidol measured as enhanced APO-induced stereotyped behavior. The hypersensitivity of the D2 
receptor induced by chronic administration of antipsychotics is considered a possible cause of tardive 
dyskinesia. 
No off targets activity of brexpiprazole was observed in a binding assay towards several receptors, 
channels and enzymes. The potential to be helpful in cognitive impairment in psychotic disorders was 
shown. 
In rats brexpiprazole induced dose dependent CNS depression and decrease in body temperature at 30 
and 100 mg/kg doses at exposure margins (5.0) in excess of the human AUC of 3950 ng.h/mL at the 
maximum human recommended dose (MHRD) of 4 mg only for the higher dose used; therefore, 
brexpiprazole-induced CNS depression effect is likely relevant, consistently with what is observed in 
clinical. 
No effect on the respiratory system of rats was seen, when administered up to 30 mg/kg.  
Concerning cardiovascular system brexpiprazole administered orally at 30 mg/kg (Cmax 2048, 
exposure margin 10) in conscious adult dogs induced a prolongation of the QT interval and QTc. 
Moreover, prolonged QT and QTc were also observed in monkeys at 10 (Cmax 496.9 ng/mL, exposure 
margin 2.5) and 30 mg/kg/day (Cmax 1427 ng/mL, exposure margin 7.2) on Day 1 in the 4- and 
13-week repeated dose studies respectively, and in the juvenile dog toxicity report at 30 mg/kg, 
corresponding to brexpiprazole exposure in excess of about 10 fold of the clinical exposure at the 
MHRD. Even though the in vitro and in vivo effects are observed at much higher concentration and 
exposure than those reached in patients treated with brexpiprazole MHRD, the effects on QT 
prolongation associated with brexpiprazole administration may be considered to represent a potential 
risk to patients particularly at dose initiation, even in light of available clinical data (Clinical Trial 
331-10-242) in which significant signs of QT prolongation have been observed in female patients.  
The current RXULTI application is for approval of brexpiprazole as monotherapy in the treatment of 
schizophrenia. Anyway, concomitant medications are commonly used in schizophrenic patients: e.g. 
antidepressants, anxiolytics. Since pharmacology of brexpiprazole is believed to be mediated by a 
combination of activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors, the potential for pharmacodynamic 
drug-drug interactions is to be considered.  
Following oral administration, an approximately linear PK profile was observed in rats and monkeys 
species used in toxicological evaluations. In both rat and monkey a food effect reducing absorption of 
brexpiprazole was observed (differently from the dog). A gender effect in fed female rats was observed 
with higher AUC value. In contrast to human bioavailability (95%), brexpiprazole showed low 
bioavailability in rats (13.6%) and monkeys (31%).

In vitro, brexpiprazole was highly bound to serum protein across species tested (mouse, rat, rabbit, 
dog, monkey, human). Brexpiprazole was bound predominantly to albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein in 
human serum. In vivo brexpiprazole protein binding in rat and monkey plasma was lower than in vitro 
protein binding; no gender effect in rat and no overall time dependency was observed up to 48 hours. 
From clinical studies, brexpiprazole bound human plasma protein to 99%. 
In vitro, neither warfarin nor diazepam affected brexpiprazole binding to human albumin while digitoxin 
was able to displace brexpiprazole only at low extent not clinically relevant. 
In vitro, DM-3411 protein binding in the monkey and human sera was lower than that of brexpiprazole.   
Following oral administration in rats, the concentrations of radioactivity the CNS were generally lower 
than in plasma and were quantifiable up to 24 hr post-dose in males and up to 8 hr post-dose in 
females. An uneven brexpiprazole distribution pattern was observed: almost no radioactivity was 
observed in the white matter. From these results, there was no evidence on the relationship between 
the cerebral distribution of this drug and the brain lesions (demyelination and necrosis of the 
oligodendrocytes in the neurotoxicity toxicity studies. The major metabolites DM-3411 was not 
detected in rat CNS; since no brain distribution study was performed in other species nor in human 
tissue. It is not possible to exclude a different behavior of DM-3411 in CNS.  
Although results in pigmented rats (Long-Evans) suggested brexpiprazole has an affinity for melanin. 
Brexpiprazole resulted non-phototoxic in albino mice toxicological studies. 
Brexpiprazole and its metabolites were transferred into the foetus of pregnant rats at concentrations 
that were generally comparable to levels seen in maternal blood. 
The S-oxide of the benzothiophene structure of brexpiprazole DM-3411 resulted the most abundant 
brexpiprazole metabolite both in vitro and in vivo across species except for female rat where DM-3404 
was the predominant in vitro metabolite. In Human Cytochrome P450s Baculovirus Insect Cell 
Expressed and in human liver microsomes, brexpiprazole was mainly metabolised to DM-3411 by 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Brexpiprazole showed a high inhibitory potential to CYP2B6 isoform (Ki=5.01 M) 
in human liver microsomes and a small induction potential to CYP1A2, CYP3A4/5 and CYP3A4 activity in 
primary cultured human hepatocytes.  
The biotransformation profile of brexpiprazole was qualitatively similar across species.  
DM-3411 did not significantly inhibit several CYP isoenzyme and no induction potential by DM-3411 was 
assessed. Being pharmacologically active in rat, monkey and human, DM-3411 was fully characterised 
from the safety point of view. 
In both female and male rats and male monkeys unchanged brexpiprazole was eliminated mainly with 
feces and excretion was almost complete by 168 hr post-dose. No sex differences in excretion of 
brexpiprazole were noted in rats. 
Overall, based on the results from in vitro CYP and transporter studies, and clinical DDI studies, the 
potential for brexpiprazole or DM-3411 to produce systemic drug-drug interactions appears minimal. 
Rats and cynomolgus monkeys were used in general dose-repeat toxicity studies. They are considered 
relevant species for assessment of human safety due to presence of the pharmacological target, and 
comparable metabolic profile with humans, although the very low exposure reached in monkeys raises 
concerns.

In all rat studies, there was a largely consistent pattern of observations including decrease in body 
weight gain and food consumption, incomplete eyelid closure, hypoactivity, lacrimation, creeping, 
staggering gait, poor physical condition (consistent with the depression of CNS as the brexpiprazole 
pharmacodynamic effects), hyperreactivity and aggressiveness that might be excessive 
adaptive-responses to the brexpiprazole-induced depression of CNS.  
Clonic convulsions occurred at exposure in term of AUC0-24 of about 11 fold higher than that reached in 
patients receiving the MHRD of 4 mg/kg of brexpiprazole. Although no longer present during the 
recovery phase of the study, clonic convulsions is judged to be a toxic change in rats due to 
brexpiprazole exposure. Clonic convulsion/seizure is regarded as a dopamine under activity condition 
mediated by dopamine antagonist agents (Starr, 1996). "Seizure" is considered a potential risk for 
humans in the RXULTI RMP.  
Haematology and clinical chemistry changes induced by brexpiprazole are considered not toxicologically 
relevant due to their sporadic nature, the absence of a dose-response relationship, small magnitude of 
change, almost total reversibility, possible association with decreased food consumption and body 
weight or stress and absence in monkeys and in humans. 
Brain lesions were observed in rats at brexpiprazole exposures about 29 and 7 fold higher for males and 
females respectively.  
Spermatogenesis, hypertrophy of corpus luteum, uterus atrophy and mucification, increased ovary 
weights and increased incidence of lobular hyperplasia with secretion of milk in the mammary gland 
(pseudopregnancy) and femminization of mammary gland in males observed at high doses, are 
considered consequences of drug-related pharmacologically mediated hyperprolactinemia. 
Similar to studies in the rat, in monkey studies there was a largely consistent pattern of observations 
linked to brexipirazole pharmacodynamics. Unlike the rat, tremors, limited to the extremities in 4 and 
13 week studies and whole body tremors in the 39 week studies, were observed. Tremors are not 
considered mediated by pharmacological CNS depression. The whole tremors are present at exposures 
even lower than those observed in patient receiving the therapeutic dose of brexpiprazole, and they are 
not reversible in females monkeys dosed at exposure 1.3 fold higher that reached in patients. Tremors 
are one of the signs of EPS a common composite adverse reaction due by antidopaminergic effect of 
antipsychotics. In short term controlled trials EPS-related TEAEs (mainly driven by akathisia events) 
higher than placebo was observed only for 4 mg. EPS is an important identified risk in RMP also 
supported by non-clinical data. Thus the claimed intermediate level of brexpiprazole dopaminergic tone 
that should allow to remain beneath the threshold development of positive symptoms and avoid 
adverse effect as EPSs (Frankel and Schwartz, 2017) appears not met in clinical settings at higher 
doses. 
Among the EPS, tardive diskinesia is associated with long-term use of antidopaminergic agents and is 
characterised by irreversibility after removal of the antidopaminergic agent (Ure et al., 2016). This is 
likely mediated by sensitisation of D2 receptors. In pharmacodynamic study 020354, repeated 
administration of 6 mg/kg brexpiprazole showed at least a comparable potential to enhance sensitivity 
of postsynaptic D2 receptors than haloperidol. 
The genotoxic potential of brexpiprazole was investigated in a bacterial reverse mutagenicity assay, an 
in vitro mammalian mutagenicity assay in L5178Y tk+/- cells and two in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus tests with a two day exposure period and in unscheduled DNA Synthesis Test.  
Assessment report

Brexpiprazole was weakly genotoxic at cytotoxic doses in vitro Mouse Lymphoma study, however 
brexpiprazole was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation test and in the in vivo genotoxicity tests 
(bone marrow micronucleus, in vivo/in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis).  
Although the proposed safety margin for mice and rat carcinogenicity is quite low, both assays are 
considered overall adequate. In CD 1 mice daily oral gavage administration of brexpiprazole revealed 
degenerative changes in mammary glands and pituitary in females given >0.75 mg/kg/day without 
dose related difference. The hyperprolactinemia hypothesis mediated by brexpiprazole dopamine "D2 
antagonist effect" for mice female tumours is considered plausible taking also into account that no 
pattern of change was observed for other hormones linked to mammary tumours, even if some 
clarification is needed as regards the claimed pharmacodynamics brexpiprazole D2 partial agonist 
activity. Although the induction of mammary neoplastic lesions by hyperprolactinemia cannot yet be 
considered definitively an exclusive ‘rodent-specific’ phenomenon, the role of prolactin in human breast 
tumours remains unsettled therefore, at this time we have no definitive data suggesting increased risk 
of breast cancer secondary to hyperpolactinemia caused by antpsychotic, and further prospective 
studies with large number of patients are considered desirable in this area before a definitive answer 
can be provided (Vyas, 2012). Available clinical data derived only by short-term trials, showed that 
median prolactin values increased from baseline in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group and were 
more pronounced in females compared with males and in general the increase in prolactin was not 
associated with an adverse clinical outcome (i.e., AEs potentially related to prolactin elevation). 
Rat male fertility was unaffected up to 100 mg/kg. Prolonged estrus and decreased fertility (pregnancy 
rate of 80.0% and 78.9%, respectively, as compared with 95.0% in controls) at 3 and 30 mg/kg, were 
observed in female rats, as well as increased pre-implantation losses at 30 mg/kg (17.7% vs 3.0% in 
control 3.0%). The NOAEL for female reproduction was 0.3 mg/kg/day (0.3 exposure margins in terms 
of AUC). Impaired female rat fertility islikely related to the increase serum prolactin induced by 
brexpiprazole. 
Based on results from rat and rabbit embryo-foetal development studies, no clear signs of fetal 
malformations were observed in brexpiprazole-treated rats when tested up to the approximate clinical 
AUC exposure (estimation based on TK data in non-pregnant rats). In rabbit, vertebral malformations 
were seen at exposeure ~16-fold the clinical AUC. These skeletal malformations although seen at a low 
incidence were not observed in the control group and their incidences are outside the historical control 
data of the test facility and literature data. In addition, the incidence of the visceral malformation 
(absence of gall bladder) seen in 2 fetuses of 1 litter is also outside the historical control data and 
literature data. The "use in pregnancy and lactation" is a missing information in the RMP and the 
participation in the National Pregnancy Registry for Atypical antipsychotics has been requested to be 
included in the RMP as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
Delayed growth, physical development and impaired viability of the offspring were only observed at 
maternally toxic brexpiprazole doses in a pre-/postnatal development toxicity study in rats. 
Fetus and milk transfer of [14C]-brexpiprazole after oral administration to rats, was demonstrated at 
concentrations that were generally comparable to levels seen in maternal blood.  
In the table below a comparison of Cmax and AUC0-24h values for brexpiprazole and the main 
metabolite DM-3411 at the NOAELs of pivotal toxicology reports vs human exposure at the proposed 
therapeutic dosage of 4 mg/day (derived from clinical trial report 331-08-205: brexpiprazole Cmax 199 
ng/mL and AUC 0-24 3950 ng.h/mL at day 14) and respective exposure multiples, is reported: 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 47/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At NOAEL safety margins based on toxicokinetic exposure data (Cmax and AUC both for parent 
compound and the main metabolite) are quite low in both chronic rat and monkey reports and in rat and 
rabbits female fertility studies. In monkeys margins still remains low also at the highest doses.  
In the repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, brexpirazole-induced effects were generally 
mild at the low dose levels (male rats 3, female rats 1 mg/kg/day, monkeys 1 mg/kg/day). At these 
doses, exposure margin in term of AUC does not exist: 0.1 M-0.8 F and 0.4 in male and female rats and 
monkeys, respectively. More evident effects were observed at the high dose levels where exposure 
multiples were 11.2 in males and 8.7 in females rats and 1.8 in males and 1.35 in females monkeys, i.e. 
not in high excess of human therapeutic exposure, especially in monkey. This can be due to the fact that 
brexpiprazole toxicities observed in mice, rats and monkeys were mainly related to the exaggerated 
pharmacological activity (e.g. hypoactivity, hypothermia or hyperprolactinemia). Despite this, the 
studies conducted are considered sufficiently adequate to support the current application taking also 
into account that histopathological changes other than those related to these clinical conditions and 
other toxicities were not evident in animals that survived the dosing phase.  
Drug substance impurities were chemically and toxicologically qualified.  
Brexpiprazole was not considered to be phototoxic in albino mice studies. 
As regard the abuse liability/potential, brexpiprazole was considered to possess discriminative stimulus 
effects in rats but no withdrawal signs suggestive of physical dependence production were evident in 
rats, nor reinforcing effect in the IV self-administration experiment in rhesus monkeys. No withdrawal 
signs were recorded in the recovery periods of the rat and monkey repeated dose toxicity studies. 
Brexpiprazole is very persistent and very bioaccumulative, but not toxic: possible enrichment of 
brexpiprazole in terrestrial food chains might pose a concern. This risk is reflected in sections 5.3 and 
6.6 of the SmPC.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of brexpiprazole are considered adequately assessed and supportive of the 
marketing autorisation of RXULTI in the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. The CHMP 
considers the following measures necessary to address the non clinical issues: The Applicant is 
committed to perform an OECD 106 study to determine the adsorption of brexpiprazole in three soils 
and then re-evaluate the ERA once completed.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712, OPC-331, and Lu AF41156) is a new chemical entity developed for 
treatment of schizophrenia (and other psychiatric disorders) in adult patients. The pharmacology of 
brexpiprazole is believed to be mediated by a combination of high binding affinity and functional 
activities at multiple monoaminergic receptors. 
The maximum daily brexpiprazole dose is 4 mg per day. In order to reduce the risk of undesirable 
effects, the recommended target dose is achieved by upward titration after the initial 1 mg per day dose 
during the first 4 days. The recommended target dose range is 2 mg to 4 mg per day. Increase dose to 
2 mg per day on Day 5 through Day 7, then to 4 mg per day on Day 8 based on the patient’s clinical 
response and tolerability. The recommended target dose range is 2 mg per day to 4 mg per day. 
Analytical methods 
A summary of the analytical methods supporting brexpiprazole PK evaluation is provided below.

Table 3 Bioanalytical Methods Used in Clinical Trials 
As general comment, analytical methods supporting brexpiprazole PK evaluation, were correctly 
developed and validated. 
Biopharmaceutics 
The mean absolute bioavailability of brexpiprazole oral tablets was 95.1%. Brexpiprazole, is considered 
to be a BCS Class II compound, i.e. a high Permeability, low Solubility drug, according to the 
Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Guidance.  
Initially, 0.05 mg, 0.25 mg, 1 mg, and 5 mg brexpiprazole tablet strengths were developed and used in 
the majority of phase 1 clinical trials. For phase 3 safety and efficacy trials, additional brexpiprazole 
tablet dose strengths (0.5 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4mg tablets) were developed. The planned marketed 
(commercial) brexpiprazole tablets are 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg dose strengths.     
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 52/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Brexpiprazole tablets intended for commercial use are identical to the tablets developed for the Long 
Term Stability Studies (LTSS) in terms of dose strengths (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg and 4 
mg), method of manufacturing, manufacturing scale, colorant, composition and debossing (LTSS 
tablets included dummy debossing). Thus, the Commercial tablets, hereafter, are referred to as 
LTSS/Commercial tablets. 
Bioavailability studies demonstrated that: the 3 mg LTSS/Commercial tablet is bioequivalent to the 3 
mg P3 Clinical tablet (study 331-13-209) and 3 x 1 mg P2 Clinical tablets (study 331-10-243); the 2 mg 
LTSS/Commercial tablet is bioequivalent to 2 x 1 mg P2 Clinical tablets (study 331-10-243); and the 4 
mg LTSS/Commercial tablet is bioequivalent to 4 x 1 mg P2 LTSS/Commercial tablets (study 
331-10-245). 
In trial 331-13-209, 3 mg tablets were used to determine bioequivalence between the commercial and 
clinical tablets to support the request for a strength biowaiver. However, the applicant has applied for 
0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mg tablets in this marketing authorisation. The applicant has discussed the 
rational for investigating the 3 mg, as this was triggered by results form the dissolution testing, ad it is 
agreed that a bioequivalence study of the 4 mg dose is not required.A high-fat meal does not affect the 
rate and extent of absorption of orally administered brexpiprazole at the highest dose of 4 mg 
commercial brexpiprazole tablet (Trial 331-10-246) or 2 mg P2 Clinical tablets (Trial 331-07-201). 
Solubility of brexipiprazole is pH dependent, being highly soluble at acid pH, however administration 
with 40 mg omeprazole did not affect the Cmax of brexipiprazole however there was 22% and 18% 
increase in AUCτ and AUC∞, respectively. This increase in exposure does not appear to be clinically 
significant. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data have been obtained from 28 clinical pharmacology trials. Data from 4 
studies conducted in Korea and Japan (1 in healthy subjects, 1 in patients with schizophrenia) have 
been provided but not used to support this application. 
A summary of PK studies is shown in the Table reported below.

Absorption  
Brexpiprazole is rapidly absorbed with an overall median Tmax of approximately 4 hours post single dose 
on Day 1 and of approximately 3 hours after multiple dose on Day 14. The plasma exposure of 
brexpiprazole after once-daily single- (0.2 mg to 8 mg) and multiple-dose (0.5 mg to 4 mg) increased 
approximately dose proportionally. The steady-state is reached after 10 to 12 days of daily dosing 
administration, in line with its half-life of about 90 hrs after multiple dose administration. The 
accumulation ratio after Day 14 following multiple dose daily administration seems also consistent with 
the elimination half-life of the compound.  
Distribution 
Brexpiprazole and DM-3411 are highly protein bound: more than 99% for brexpiprazole and more than 
96% in human serum for DM-3411. In human serum, brexpiprazole is bound predominantly to albumin 
and α1-acid glycoprotein in human plasma, and is not affected by warfarin, diazepam, or digitoxin, nor 
is it altered in patient s with hepatic or renal impairment. From the population PK model, the apparent 
volume of distribution (V/F) in the central and peripheral compartments was estimated to be 105 L and 
28.4 L respectively. In the responses to LoQ D120 the Applicant also provide a summary statistics of the 
estimated appartent volume of distribution (V/F) form single dose trial (127 L, SD 95.3). 
Elimination  
After single oral dose (0.2 mg to 8 mg) administration the mean half-life was 79.3 hours and 73.6 hours 
for brexpiprazole and DM-3411, respectively. After multiple, once daily administration (1 mg to 12 mg), 
the mean half life was 91.4 and 85.7 hours for brexpiprazole and DM-3411 respectively. A mass balance 
was performed in 16 healthy male subjects. The brexpiprazole dose was a combination of 
non-radiolabelled (2 mg) and radiolabelled compound (microdose tracer amount, <270 nCi) with 14C 
-brexpiprazole radiolabel inserted in either the quinolinone (8 subjects) or benzothiophene ring (8 
subjects). Samples were collected for up to 20 days (480 hours) after dosing. Hepatic clearance is the 
major route of elimination of brexpiprazole followed by renal clearance. 
Excretion 
After a single 2 mg oral dose of 14C-brexpiprazole solution (<270 nCi), mean recovery in faeces and 
urine was 46.0% and 24.6% of the oral brexpiprazole dose administered, respectively (total urinary and 
faecal radioactivity 71.1%). The total radioactivity recovery was low (71.1%). The applicant has 
qualified brexpiprazole, DM-3411, and DM-3412, MOP-54522 OPC-54050, OPC-34835 and OPC-3952 in 
plasma (SFO-34318 was not quantified) following 14 days of dosing in subjects with schizophrenia (CSR 
331-08-205). Furthermore, the applicant has performed sparse sampling in late phase studies and 
quantified brexpiprazole and DM-3411 in these studies. However, the applicant has not addressed the 
potential accumulation of the metabolites; while the metabolites (apart from DM-3411) appear to have 
minimal contribution to the primary effects of brexpiprazole, this does not negate any off-target effects 
if there is accumulation. Most brexpiprazole elimination is due to faecal excretion followed by urine 
excretion.  The percentages of unchanged brexpiprazole recovered in urine and faeces form less than 
1% and 14% of the dose administered, respectively. 
The little amount (<1%) of unchanged brexpiprazole recovered in the urine indicates that the large 
majority of the administered dose is metabolised. 
Metabolism 
Results from ADME study showed that brexpripazole is extensively (>97%) metabolised in humans. 
Less than 1% of unchanged brexipripazole could be detected in urine. The predominant human CYPs 
concerned with metabolism of brexpiprazole were identified as CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The contribution of 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 55/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolic pathway to the total apparent CL of brexpiprazole is estimated to be 
46.7% and 43.3% and about 10% attributed to other minor pathways [i.e., flavin-containing 
monooxygenases (FMO3)]. Other CYPs that contribute to brexpiprazole include CYP2B6, CYP2C19, 
CYP1A1. The main metabolite identified was DM-3411, in human studies, the metabolites OPC-3952, 
SFO-34318, DM-3411, DM-3404, DM-341, DM-3413, MOP-54522, and OPC-34835, were observed in 
urine. 
Brexpipraxole has a maior circulating metabolite (>10%); metabolite DM-3411. PK parameters of 
metabolite DM-3411 were evaluated in all single and multiple dose phase I and phase II studies. The 
Applicant claimed that this metabolite is not considered pharmacologically active, however the non 
clinical review of data showed that it is a potent antagonism activity to hD2Short (IC50<5 nM). 
DM-3411 brain penetration has been shown to be poor based on a non-clinical study in rats 
administered high doses of radiolabelled brexpiprazole.  
The metabolite-to-parent ratio of DM-3411 following 2 mg single- and 4 mg multiple-dose 
administration (21 days) was 34.9% and 32.6% of brexpiprazole exposure (AUC), respectively. The 
metabolite-to-parent ratio of DM-3411 and DM-3412 metabolites was similar across trials and following 
single- and multiple-dose administration. 
In study 331-08-208, comparison of the AUC values in subjects in Group 4 (poor metabolizers of 
CYP2D6 isozyme) to the subjects in Groups 1 through 3 (extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 isozyme) 
indicates that brexpiprazole exposure was about two-fold higher in poor metabolizers of CYP2D6; 
however, no definitive information can be drawn from this study due to the limited number of subjects. 
The effect of CYP2D6 poor metabolism has been further evaluated in a larger population and as a 
component of the population PK analysis 
The effect of CYP2D6 metabolism status (poor, intermediate, and ultra-rapid relative to extensive) on 
CL/F was included as significant covariate in the final PopPK model (considering the inferred CYP2D6 
metabolic status among subjects included in the popPK analysis, 3% were PM, 24% IM, 38.7% EM, 
1.4% UR, and 33% were missing/inconclusive).  
In subjects who are poor (PM), intermediate (IM) and ultra-rapid (UR) CYP2D6 metaboliser, CL/F was 
estimated to be -32%, -20% and +18%, respectively when compared to the value estimated for 
extensive (EM) CYP2D6 metabolizer subjects, corresponding to a +47%, +25% and -21%, change in 
brexpiprazole exposure (AUCτ), respectively. Dose adjustment of half of the label-recommended 
maintenance dose is recommended in patients with poor CYP2D6 metabolism status and the necessity 
of a mandatory genotyping assay should be discussed by the applicant. The percentages of UR, EM, IM 
and PM are highly comparable among the three pivotal studies (331-10-002, 331-10-230 and 
331-10-231).   
For brexpiprazole and DM-3411 there was a proportional increase in exposure (Cmax, AUCτ, or AUC) 
with increases in dose. Inter-subject variability for brexpiprazole was 19.0%–32.0% for Cmax and 
40.0%–55.0% for AUC∞. Intra-individual variability (residual proportional error in the population PK 
model) for brexpiprazole was 3.7% and 3.2% for the phase 1 and phase 2/3 data, respectively. 
Intra-subject variability based on BE studies was 11.9%–16.0% for Cmax and 10.8%–14.6% for 
AUC∞. 
Population PK 
A 2-compartmental population PK model was developed for oral brexpiprazole. The population PK 
analysis was performed including a total of 2654 quantifiable brexpiprazole plasma concentrations from 
154 healthy subjects and 3114 quantifiable plasma brexpiprazole concentrations from 1140 subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 56/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with MDD and 5072 PK samples from 1247 schizophrenia subjects (2541 total subjects) were available 
for the population PK analysis. The evaluable dataset included 2357 subjects, who had at least one 
measurable brexpiprazole concentration. 
Parameters estimates in the final model were: CL/F (1.65 L/hr), Q/F (0.701 L/hr), Vc/F (105 L), Vp/F 
(28.4 L) and ka (0.635h-1).Shrinkage was acceptable for CL/F (5.3%) and Vc/F (23%) but high for ka 
(58%), boot strapping and other diagnotic plots including pcVPC and GOF plots indicated a fair 
description of the data by the model however, the model underestimated the absorption phase. A 
bioavailability scaling factor was required for the subjects with MDD possibly due to non-compliance in 
these subjects. Covariates identified included age on Vc/F, weight om Vc/F, sex on CL/F and Vc/F and 
CYP2D6 genotype on CL/F. 
Regarding population pharmacokinetic analysis, the applicant has provided the pcVPCs stratified for 
each covariate. Is is agreed that there is general agreement between the observed and predicted data, 
except where there is limited data i.e., for CYP2D6 poor and ultra-rapid metabolisers. The observed 
underprediction of AUCt, especially following single-dosing, is recognised by the applicant. However, it 
is agreed that the broad conclusions following of comparing the AUCs between the different populations 
of interest can be maintained.  The applicant has further discussed the approach taken for choosing the 
final model exponents and justified this against the approach of using fixed exponents. The model 
appears adequate and using the final derived model exponents (vs fixed exponents) has minimal impact 
on the simulations.  
Special populations 
A dedicated study, study 331-09-226, was performed to determine the effect of renal impairment on 
the pharmacokinetics (PK) of brexpiprazole following a single 3 mg oral dose. This study was a 
single-dose, open-label, parallel-group, matched trial with a reduced design, evaluating the 
pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole in subjects with normal renal function and renally impaired subjects 
(subjects with severe renal impairment). 
The applicant performed a study in subjects with severe renal impairment, following a reduced design. 
The study showed an increased exposure of 68% in patients with severe impairment following 3 mg 
dose. On the basis of these study results, the Applicant proposes a maximum dose of 3 mg in these 
patients and also in patients with moderate renal impairment (not studied). 
Although a study with a full design would have provided more precise information, the applicant 
justification to apply the same dose limitation (3 mg) for safety reasons, also for moderate renal 
impairment, seems acceptable. 
Additionally, the effect of mild and moderate renal impairment was evaluated in the popPK analysis.  In 
the popPK analysis, a 22% increase in brexpiprazole exposure was observed in severe, a 13% increase 
in moderate and a 5% increase in mild renal impairment 
As already observed by the applicant there is a discrepancy in the percentage of increased exposure in 
between study 331-09-226 and popPK analysis, probably because the popPK did not account for the 
concomitant reduced hepatic clearance and CYP activity observed in subjects with severe renal 
impairment.  
This explanation is accepted, and considering the more informative data for dose recommendation in 
subjects with renal impairment as those form study 331-09-226.  
Study 331-09-225 was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of brexpiprazole in subjects 
with normal hepatic function and subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, 
and severe). This was a single-dose, open-label, parallel-group, matched trial evaluating the 
Assessment report

pharmacokinetics of brexpiprazole in subjects with normal hepatic function and hepatically impaired 
subjects after a single oral 2 mg dose of brexpiprazole.  
Brexpiprazole AUC increase by 24%, 60%, and 8% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic 
impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic functions. This unclear effect on 
brexpiprazole AUC (60% increase in hepatic function moderately impaired subjects compared to 8% 
increase in severe ones) is probably due to the small number of subjects in each group. It is noted that 
AUCinf of total and unbound (AUCinf,u) brexpiprazole is lower in SEVERE Matched Normal Hepatic 
Function Group: AUCinf =788 ng*h/ml and AUCinf,u =3.63 ng*h/ml when compared to the MODERATE 
and MILD Matched Normal subgroup where the AUCinf equal 1345 and 1393 ng*h/ml respectively and 
AUCinf,u equal 5.62 and 5.85 respectively ng*h/ml respectively. The applicant, as requested, provides 
additional comments and plausible explanations regarding the observed unclear effect of different 
degrees of hepatic impairment on brexpiprazole AUC (60% increase in hepatic function moderately 
impaired subjects compared to 8% increase in severe ones). 
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the increase of brexipripazole AUC (60%) is in line with 
the decreased CL due to the decrease hepatic function.  In subjects with severe hepatic impairment the 
absence of a change in brexpiprazole exposure (AUC increase by 8% only) may be due to counteracting 
mechanisms (reduced hepatic clearance and reduced bioavailability/increased apparent Vd/F) which 
cancel each other out.  
Moreover, decrease in total brexipiprazole Cmax by 55% and increase in the t1/2 by about 50% when 
compared to matched normal subjects are indicative of increased Vd/F and reduced hepatic CL. A trend 
in decrease of brexpiprazole Cmax of total and unbound (Cmax,u) brexpiprazole was observed across 
different degree of hepatic impairment. The Applicant was requested to further discuss the possible 
causes of this decrease in the Cmax, and comment on the possible reason why in the MILD Matched 
Normal Hepatic Function Group, the Cmax of total and unbound (Cmax,u) brexpiprazole value is 
significantly higher: Cmax= 26.7 ng/mL and Cmax,u =0.114 ng/mL  compared to the MODERATE and 
SEVERE Matched Normal subgroup where the Cmax equal 19.3 and 17.7 ng/mL and Cmax,u equal 
0.0779 and 0.0760 ng/mL, respectively. The Applicant, as requested, further discuss on a possible 
explanation for the effect of hepatic impairment on brexpiprazole absorption. The Cmax decrease is 
probably due to a possible counteracting mechanisms (reduced hepatic clearance and reduced 
bioavailability/increased Vd/F).  
In the SmPC section 4.2 where it is stated: “The maximum recommended dose in patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 7) is 3 mg once daily” as this adjustment 
considers the AUC increase but not the Cmax decrease. The recommended dose adjustment in patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment is based on the observed exposure changes in this group (AUC 
increase by 60%) and the applicant proposal to apply the same dose limitation also for subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment is deemed acceptable 
The systemic exposure of brexpiprazole in female subjects was approximately 40% to 50% higher 
(Cmax and AUC∞) compared with male subjects. The population PK estimated that females would have 
a 25% higher brexpiprazole exposure (AUCτ).  
Race (Caucasian, Black or Asian) was not identified as a covariate in brexpiprazole PK parameters in the 
population PK model. 
Weight was a significant covariate in the population PK model, however that difference between the 5th 
and 95th percentiles (53.5 kg and 118.6 kg) on the apparent central volume of distribution was less 
than 20% (-11% to +14%). 
There does not appear to be a significant difference in the PK of brexpiprazole in the elderly compared 
to subjects <65 years of age. Pharmacokinetic data are available for an adolescent population but no 
other paediatric patients. These data in adolescents have not been reviewed as the indication is for 
adults only. The applicant has a paediatric investigation plan for brexpiprazole for the treatment of

schizophrenia in children, with a waiver for the paediatric population from birth to less than 13 years of 
age (EMA decision P/0234/2016). 
CYP2D6 status was a statistically significant covariate for CL/F; CL/F of poor and intermediate CYP2D6 
metabolizers were estimated to be 32% and 20% lower (47% and 25% higher AUCtau) in these subjects 
compared with CYP2D6 EM subjects. Dose adjustment of half of the label-recommended maintenance 
dose is recommended in patients with poor CYP2D6 metabolism status. 
Drug-Drug interactions. 
In vitro 
In vitro studies demonstrated that brexpiprazole and the metabolite DM-3411 were not inhibitors of the 
CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 or the transporters MDR1 (P-gp), OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations. In vitro 
studies demonstrated that brexpiprazole1A2, 2C9, 2B6, and 3A4. In vitro studies identified 
brexpiprazole as a potential inhibitor of BCRP. Brexpiprazole does not appear to be a substrate for MDR1, 
BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 at a 14C-brexpiprazole concentration of 1 µM. 
Regarding in vitro interactions and as requested, the applicant has provided a justification for only 
performing the incubation for 48 hours, namely that phenobarbital lead to an adequate increase in 
CYP2B6 mRNA levels. The CYP inhibition studies investigating whether the metabolite DM-3411 causes 
mechanism based inhibition was provided. Given the lack of effect on the probes for CYP3A4, 2D6 and 
2B6 enzymes following brexpiprazole dosing for 8 days, mechanism-based is unlikely. 
The applicant considers that since DM-3411 is produced by human liver microsomes it is likely to be 
involved in the in vitro induction studies utilising brexpiprazole as a perpetrator. 
Population PK analyses were utilized to determine the effects of coadministration of strong CYP3A4 and 
strong CYP2D6 inhibitors with brexpiprazole (dual inhibition). Compared with CYP2D6 EM subjects 
simulated AUCτ was:  
-  
-   
-  
1.8-fold higher in CYP2D6 EM subjects co-administered strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; 
4.8-fold higher in CYP2D6 PM subjects co-administered strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; and 
5.1-fold higherCYP2D6 EM subjects co-administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (fluoxetine and 
paroxetine)  
antidepressants and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (dual inhibition). Dose adjustment in 
these subjects is  
recommended. 
Taking into account the consistency between observed data (with one inhibition) and simulations and 
also considering that the popPK model used for such simulation was well validated internally and 
externally, in principle dose reduction to one quarter (25%) in case of co-administration of strong 
CYP3A4 and strong CYP2D6 inhibitors with brexpiprazole (dual inhibition) is acceptable. VPCs plots 
generated using data from DDI study 331-12-208 (with CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors) were provided. 
Model predicted concentrations were consistent with the observed data. 
In vivo 
Brexpiprazole as victim 
In vivo DDI studies were performed to evaluate the effects of other drugs on brexpiprazole PK 
parameters and vice versa. 
In study 331-08-208 the co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole, 200 mg twice 
daily for 6 days starting from day 14) with brexpiprazole (2 mg single dose administered without 
inhibitors (Day 1) and with inhibitors (Day 14)) resulted in similar brexpiprazole Cmax. Brexpiprazole 
Assessment report

AUCt and AUCinf were 59% (GMR: 1.59, 90% CI: 1.44-1.75) and 97% (GMR: 1.97, 90% CI: 1.63-2.37) 
higher, respectively, and t1/2 was about 50% longer with ketoconazole. 
Co-administration of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (quinidine, 324 mg dose of quinidine gluconate 
extended release once daily, for 6 days starting from day 14) with brexpiprazole (2 mg single dose 
administered without inhibitors (Day 1) and  with inhibitors (Day 14)) resulted in similar brexpiprazole 
Cmax. Brexpiprazole AUCt and AUCinf were 63% (GMR: 1.63, 90% CI: 1.34-1.97) and 94% (GMR: 1.94, 
90% CI: 1.49-2.53) higher, respectively and t1/2 was about 50% longer with quinidine. 
Co-administration of a strong CYP2B6 inhibitor (ticlopidine, 250 mg twice daily) did not result in 
significant changes in the brexpiprazole PK (Cmax and AUC). 
Based on the results of these DDI trials, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 were identified to be primarily responsible 
for the metabolism of brexpiprazole. Dosage adjustment to one-half of the target dose is recommended 
in subjects who are taking concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors. 
Results from Study 331-09-224 showed that co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin, 
600 mg once daily) with brexpiprazole (4 mg) resulted in 31% and 73% lower brexpiprazole Cmax and 
AUC∞, respectively.  For DM-3411, co-administration with rifampin resulted in Cmax values being 
reduced by 50%, AUCt and AUC∞ were similar/slightly decreased. These results suggest that DM-3411 
is formed and metabolised by the CYP3A4. 
The applicant has simulated the effect of coadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer on the PK of 
brexpiprazole, based on the clearance observed in the DDI study. Simulations of 12 mg once daily, 16 
mg once daily, 6 mg twice daily and 8 mg twice daily administration of brexpiprazole were provided by 
the applicant. On the basis of the submitted simulations the SmPC sections 4.2, and 4.5 have been 
amended to reflect that if brexpiprazole is used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. 
rifampicin), the total daily dose requirement of brexpiprazole is increased by approximately a factor of 
three at steady state. Once daily dosing results in high peak to trough fluctuation, hence twice daily 
divided dosing is preferable from a PK perspective.  
Brexpiprazole as perpetrator 
In vivo studies indicate that brexpiprazole does not change the PK of lovastatin (a CYP3A4 substrate), 
bupropion, (a CYP2B6 substrate), and fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) with no changes in Cmax or 
AUCτ. Brexpiprazole did not alter the Ae48h dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio indicating 
brexpiprazole is not a 2D6 inhibitor. 
Administration of rouvastatin (a BCRP transporter substrate) with brexpiprazole resulted in similar AUCt 
and AUC∞ but 24% lower Cmax values for rouvastatin compared to rouvastatin alone. In a secondary 
analysis, similar results were observed when only healthy subjects homozygous for c.421CC were 
analysed. 
In the SmPC, the applicant states that ‘brexpiprazole does not affect absorption of medicinal products 
that are substrates of BCRP transporter (rosuvastatin) and Pgp transporter (fexofenadine). This 
statement does not fully reflect the findings of the clinical studies, given the minimal impact of 
brexpiprazole on the PK of the BCRP transporter, rosuvastatin, however this issue is not pursued. 
Omeprazole is a CYP2C19 inhibitor (and a CYP1A2 inducer), while CYP2C19 metabolism is a known 
albeit minor metabolic pathway between brexipiprazole and DM-3411. Administration of brexpiprazole 
with omeprazole (Study 331-10-240) does not affect its rate or extent of absorption as the GMR and 
90% CI for Cmax and AUC PK parameters were within the pre specified equivalence limits of 0.50 to 
2.00, however, the Applicant was requested to discuss clinical relevance of apparent decrease in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 60/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure (Cmax) of DM-3411 observed in the omeprazole interaction study. The Applicant has 
recognised that CYP2C19 may be involved in the higher brexpiprazole and lower DM-3411 exposure 
caused by omeprazole, however has concluded this is not clinically relevant.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics of brexpiprazole has been relatively poorly described in the dossier. The receptor 
binding profile has been characterised as having modulatory activity at the serotonin (5-HT) and 
dopamine (D) systems that combines partial agonist activity at serotonergic 5-HT1A and at 
dopaminergic D2 receptors with antagonist activity at serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors, with similar high 
affinities at all of these receptors and antagonist activity at noradrenergic α1B/2C receptors. The 
mechanism of action has also been insufficiently described as possibly correlating to the 5-HT1A/D2 
receptor partial agonist activity in combination with 5-HT2A and α1B/2C receptors antagonism and 
since this is a new compound a full and well informed discussion on presumed mechanism of action was 
requested to the Applicant. The applicant has provided the requested information. While it mainly 
consists of hypothetical inferences, it is broadly based on the known pharmacology and therefore 
valuable.Detailed analysis of primary pharmacology has been conducted through the Studies 
331-07-202 (A Phase 1, Open-Label, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Study in Healthy Subjects 
Following a Single Oral Dose of OPC-34712) and 331-09-219 (A Multiple Dose Positron Emission 
Tomography study). The results from these studies confirm the affinity of brexpiprazole to dopamine 
and 5HT receptors.  
Study 331-07-202 was conducted to determine the degree of striatal dopamine D2/D3 receptor 
occupancy after single dose brexpiprazole administration (0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 
or 6 mg) in healthy subjects. 
According to this study results, brexpiprazole Cmax and AUC PK parameters as well as mean D2/D3 
receptor regional occupancy increased accordingly to brexpiprazole doses. Additionally, plasma 
brexpiprazole concentration up to ~64 ng/mL (reached after 6 mg brexpiprazole administration) 
corresponded to more than 80% (Omax=89.2%, EC50=8.13 ng/mL) and 90% (Omax=95.4%, 
EC50=7.75 ng/mL) dopamine D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the putamen and caudate nucleus, 
respectively. 
Study 331-09-219 assessed D2/D3, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, and SERT occupancies at steady state for low (1 
mg/day) and high (4 mg/day) brexpiprazole doses for 10 consecutive days in patients with 
schizophrenia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 61/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A higher receptor occupancy was observed following treatment with brexpiprazole 4 mg/day vs 1 
mg/day (67% vs. 27% for D2 and 45% vs. 28% for 5-HT2A, respectively). D3 receptors resulted bound 
only upon administration of brexpiprazole 4 mg/day (31%). Negligible occupancy was detected at 
5-HT1A receptors and SERT (both tested at 4 mg/day only), although no definitive assumptions can be 
drawn for SERT considering the anomalous PK data concerning patient cohort 3 vs. cohort 1, both of 
which received brexpiprazole 4 mg/day. 
According to the EC50-only model, it appears that brexpiprazole would be moderately D2-preferring 
(EC50=68 ng/mL) as compared to other receptors (EC50=313 and 92 ng/mL for D3 and 5-HT2A 
receptor, respectively). 
Considering the brexpiprazole single dose-linked PK/PD modelling results from study 331-07-202 and 
the steady state PK parameters after brexpiprazole multiple dosing (study 331-08-205), it appears that 
multiple-dose, once-daily administration of brexpiprazole from 1 to 2 mg would be suitable to reach the 
Omax values observed in study 331-07-202 and, thus, worth pursuing to be further studied in 
schizophrenia treatment. In study 331-07-202, PET scans (n=3 sans for each subjects) were performed 
4 hours post dose (Cmax) and 23.5 hours post dose that represents the Ctrough concentration, 
considering a once daily administration. PET data at these time point are condideres sufficient to 
correlate plasma concentration with receptor occupancies. 
The analysis performed in study 331-09-219 shows similar criticalities. The EC50 values estimated in 
study 331-09-219 (EC50=68, 313 and 92 ng/mL for D2, D3 and 5-HT2A receptor, respectively) would, 
in principle, fit better with the multiple-dose administration of brexpiprazole 4 mg/day (resulting in Css, 
min=112 ng/ml) rather than brexpiprazole 1 mg/day (giving Css, min=21.2 ng/ml). The Applicant was 
requested to provide an exposure-occupancy relationship that considers brexpiprazole trough 
concentrations at Day 10 pre-last dose for an adequate evaluation of receptor occupancies at the 
indicated time sampling. The applicant provided the trough concentrations at Day 10 pre-last dose and 
also figures showing the requested exposure-occupancy relationship. However, this study should not 
considered as informative, considering the low number of patients in each group and the consequent 
high CV% around PK parameters. 
The off-site actions (secondary pharmacology) have primarily been investigated in the dedicated QT 
study. The placebo-corrected change from baseline in QTcI in study 331-10-242 showed no significant 
impact of brexpiprazole on cardiac repolarisation in the overall study patient population. Analysis of the 
placebo-corrected change from baseline in QTcI in study 331-10-242 showed no significant impact of  
brexpiprazole on cardiac repolarization in the overall study patient population at the recommended dose 
(4 mg) and supratherapeutic dose (12 mg, 3-times highest recommended dose. However, the threshold 
level of regulatory concern (upper bound of the 95% CI>10 ms) was observed in female patients both 
at therapeutic (4 mg) and supratherapeutic (12 mg) brexpiprazole doses (see also safety concerns). 
Further insights on these outcomes are thus deemed necessary, and the Applicant was requested 
toanalyze and discuss study 331-10-242 results concerning the primary endpoint (Time-matched, 
Placebo-adjusted Mean Change from Baseline in QTcI and QTcF) using weight categories, CYP2D6 
phenotype categories (UR, EM, IM, PM) as well as concomitant medications (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 
inhibitors) and subject sex as stratification factors. The Applicant explains that any further subgroup 
analysis of the data (by weight or by CYP2D6 metabolic status) is not warranted due the small number 
of subjects expected in each category and that the range of concentrations observed in the 
supratherapeutic arm of study 331-10-242 are well above the slightly higher concentrations that may 
be observed in subjects due to weight, age, CYP2D6 metabolism status or gender. 
In particular, the observed differences between genders were most likely related to the smaller number 
of female than male subjects in each treatment group (14 females versus 48 males for brexpiprazole 4 
mg, 13 versus 40 for brexpiprazole 12 mg, and 13 versus 50 for moxifloxacin). 
Assessment report

A supplemental exposure-response analysis in males and females were provided by the company. The 
model showed a non significant effect of brexpiprazole and its metabolite on QTcF in both male and 
female sub-groups. 
The applicant has not provided any requested information on pharmacodynamic interactions of 
brexpiprazole. This lack of information is not deemed critical at this stage, but the prescribers must be 
informed of it. The following statement shoul be added to the section 4.5 of the SmPC under the 
subheading “Potential for brexpiprazole to affect other medicinal products”: “No information on 
pharmacodynamic interactions of Brexpiprazole is available at present. Caution should be exercised 
when prescribed with other medications.” 
The applicant has stated that no genetic effects on pharmacodynamics have been investigated. The 
CYP2D6 genetic differences are primarily a pharmacokinetic issue. This lack of data is not deemed 
critical, but the prescribers should be informed of it in the product information. As requested, the 
following statement “Influences of genetic variation on the pharmacodynamic responses to 
Brexpiprazole have not been investigated” has been added to the section 5.1 of the SmPC under the 
subheading “Pharmacodynamic effects”. 
PK-PD relationship has been examined. Exposure-PANSS response analysis suggests that the increases 
of brexpiprazole dose between 1 and 4 mg were associated with PANSS improvement over placebo. No 
relationship between exposures was observed for increased insomnia, percent change in bodyweight or 
akathisia, except for a potential relationship between the 3rd tertile for Cmax and akathisia. 
Overall, the pharmacodynamics of brexpiprazole has been minimally described. It is recognised that the 
relevance of this information is limited for the efficacy but it is more important for the safety and the 
posology of the product. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data have been obtained from numerous clinical pharmacology trials. Overall 
the clinical pharmacology of brexpiprazole and its metabolite, DM-3411 are reasonably well described 
characterised. Some pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues were addressed during the 
procedure. 
The applicant has qualified brexpiprazole, DM-3411, and DM-3412, MOP-54522 OPC-54050, 
OPC-34835 and OPC-3952 in plasma (SFO-34318 was not quantified) following 14 days of dosing in 
subjects with schizophrenia (CSR 331-08-205). Furthermore, the applicant has performed sparse 
sampling in late phase studies and quantified brexpiprazole and DM-3411 in these studies. However, 
the applicant has not addressed the potential accumulation of the metabolites; while the metabolites 
(apart from DM-3411) appear to have minimal contribution to the primary effects of brexpiprazole, this 
does not negate any off-target effects if there is accumulation. In conclusion, except for DM-3411 and 
DM-3412 metabolites (32.6% and 5.76% of brexpiprazole exposure, respectively; SCP, the exposure to 
all other identified metabolites were at consistently low concentrations and no further accumulation is 
expected for these metabolites.   
Given the lack of effect on the probes for CYP3A4, 2D6 and 2B6 enzymes following brexpiprazole dosing 
for 8 days, mechanism-based is unlikely. 
The applicant argues that assay sensitivity decreases as the concentration of the substrate increases, 
which is agreed with. Nonetheless, the applicant has investigated a substrate concentration significantly 
lower than the concentration expected in the gut and it can be argued that it may not be physiologically 
relevant. Despite not being in line with recommendations in the guideline, the issue is not pursued. 
The applicant has simulated the effect of coadministration of a CYP3A4 inducer on the PK of 
brexpiprazole, based on the clearance observed in the DDI study.  
Assessment report

Simulations of 12 mg once daily, 16 mg once daily, 6 mg twice daily and 8 mg twice daily administration 
of brexpiprazole were provided by the applicant. On the basis of the submitted simulations the SmPC 
sections 4.2, and 4.5 have been amended to reflect that if brexpiprazole is used concomitantly with 
strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin), the total daily dose requirement of brexpiprazole is increased 
by approximately a factor of three at steady state. Once daily dosing results in high peak to trough 
fluctuation, hence twice daily divided dosing is preferable from a PK perspective. This is reflected in the 
wording of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The issues raised during the procedure have been solved.   
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The short term efficacy of brexpiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in one phase 
2, three phase 3 placebo-controlled studies and one active control study:  
 
Trial 331-07-203 is a phase 2, 6 weeks fixed-flexible dose trial with an active reference 
(aripiprazole) 
 
Trials 331-10-231 and 331-10-230 are two phase 3, 6 weeks, fixed-dose, global trials each 
including a 2mg/day and a 4mg/day dose arms and a lower dose arm for each trial of 0.25mg 
and 1mg, respectively 
 
Trial 331-10-002 is a phase 3, 6 weeks fixed-dose, regional trial conducted in Japan including 
a 1mg/day, a 2mg/day and a 4mg/day dose arms 
 
Trial 14644A is a 6 weeks, flexible-dose trial with an active reference (quetiapine) including a 
2-4mg dose brexpiprazole arm 
The long term efficacy of brexpiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in one phase 
3 long-term, maintenance trial  
 
Trial 331-10-232 is a multicentre double blind placebo controlled relapse prevention trial to 
assess the efficacy safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole (1 to 4mg/day) as maintenance 
treatment in adult patients with schizophrenia 
Phase 2 dose-response study 331-07-203 
Trial 331-07-203 did not meet the primary or key secondary endpoints.  The trial did not show assay 
sensitivity, as neither aripiprazole nor any of the brexpiprazole treatment arms separated from placebo.  
The higher numeric improvement in terms of reduction of PANSS total score, compared to placebo, was 
achieved with the flexible dose 0.5-1.5 mg (LS mean change -18.47) and the flexible interval 5 ± 1 (LS

Short term studies 
Study 331-10-231 results 
The primary endpoint of mean change in PANSS Total Score from baseline to Week 6 was superior for 
the 4 mg/day (LS mean difference=−7.64, p=0.0006) and brexpiprazole 2 mg/day (LS mean 
difference= −8.72,  
p < 0.0001) groups over placebo. The brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group showed practically no 
improvement in comparison to placebo in the change in PANSS Total Score from baseline to Week 6 (LS 
mean difference= −2.89, p = 0.2910). Improvement for both the 4 and the 2 mg arm was shown 
starting at week 2 (with some signal of efficacy already at week 1). The key secondary endpoint for this 
study was the LS mean change from baseline to week 6 in the CGI-S score. 
The LS mean of the brexpiprazole 2mg treatment arm was -1.20 therefore the separation from placebo 
was statistically significant (p = 0.0056), the same applies for the 4mg treatment arm (LS mean -1.15)

which separated significantly from placebo (p = 0.0012). Patients treated with the dose of 0.25 
improved minimally (LS mean change from baseline -0.85) and resulted non-statistically significant. 
These data provide evidence of efficacy of brexpiprazole at the dose of 2 and 4 mg/day in terms of 
reduction of psychotic symptoms as measured by the PANSS. No clear dose-response is observed. 
Study 331-10-230 results 
The demographic characteristics were balanced across the treatment arms. Of 674 randomised patients, 
657 were included in the efficacy analysis set and 32% did not complete the study.  
Only patients treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg showed a statistically significant separation from placebo 
in the primary endpoint (change from baseline to week 6 at the PANSS) and key secondary endpoint 
(change from baseline to week 6 in CGI-S). Patients on placebo improved -13.53 in 6 weeks compared 
to patients on brexpiprazole 4mg who improved -20 points. Patients on brexpiprazole 2 mg showed a 
reduction of -16.6 at the PANSS and therefore their difference with placebo was not statistically 
significant. Patients in the brexpiprazole 1mg arm improved as much as those on 2mg (-16.9 points), 
although the randomization was unbalanced and the 1 mg arm counted only 117 patients.  The onset of 
efficacy, when measured at the PANSS, was already significant at week 1, but only in the 4 mg arm. The 
difference in CGI-S scores between treatment and placebo showed a similar pattern where only patients 
in the 4 mg arm separated significantly from placebo (-1.19 LS mean vs -0.81 treatment and placebo 
respectively). Numeric improvement in the 2 mg and 1 mg arms was similar.These results support an 
effect of brexpiprazole in reducing schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS at the dose of 
4 mg. In addition, the dose of 1 mg shows similar results as the dose of 2 mg. 
Study 331-10-002 (Japan) results 
Between 40% and 30% of patients discontinued from the study depending on study arm and as 
expected the highest discontinuation rate was found in the placebo arm. The relative proportion of 
males in the study is sensibly lower as compared to studies 231 and 230. In this regional phase 3 short 
term pivotal study only patients treated with brexpiprazole 2 mg showed a statistically significant 
separation from placebo in the primary endpoint (change from baseline to week 6 at the PANSS). Of 
note, the placebo group improved less than in previous studies (230 & 231) with a LS mean change at 
week 6 of -7.63 at the PANSS. The group treated with 2 mg improved substantially (LSmean change 
-14.95, p = 0.0124) and kept the statistical significance also with the hochberg procedure. This 
difference appeared at week 3 of treatment and remained trought the study period.  The group treated 
with 4 mg improved less (-3.86 difference from placebo, not statistically significant). The lowest 
numerical improvement was observed in the group treated with 1mg. These results support the efficacy 
of brexpiprazole in reducing schizophrenia symtoms as measured by the PANSS at the dose of 2 mg. 
The frequency of the CYP2D6 genotype should be taken into account when comparing these results with 
those from the multisite international population (studies 231, 230, and 14644A). However, the 
percentages of UR, EM, IM and PM are highly comparable among the three pivotal studies (331-10-002, 
331-10-230 and 331-10-231), therefore it is unlikely that the inconsistency of the pivotal efficacy 
results with respect to brexpiprazole doses may depends on pharmacogenomic issues.

Study 14644A (short-term, flexible dose) results 
In this flexible dose, active and placebo controlled study the group treated with the dose range of 2-4 
mg brexpiprazole failed to separate from placebo in the difference in reduction of PANSS total scores at 
6 weeks. Placebo patients showed a reduction in PANSS total scores at week 6 equal to -15,9 (higher 
than what seen in all the other 3 phase 3 trials), therefore the improvement with brexpiprazole (-20) 
was not sufficient to achieve clinical and statistical difference, whilest patients treated with flexible 
doses of quetiapine XR improved by -24 points therefore this different was statistically significant in 
comparison to placebo. The difference in CGI-S scores between the brexpiprazole group and placebo 
was statistcally significant (LS mean -1.2 vs -0.9 for placebo, p = 0.0142), although the numeric 
improvement was slightly inferior to that of the quetiapine group (LS mean -1.4, p = 0.0002). However, 
the primary and the key secondary endpoints had to be tested hierarchically. Therefore, since the 
primary endpoint was not statistically significant (p = 0.056), the analysis of the key secondary 
endpoint should not to be  formally considered. The magnitude of treatment effect of quetiapine 
appears larger than brexpiprazole, and this puts the efficacy of brexpiprazole in context even though it 
is acknowledged that the trial is not powered for superiority or head to head comparison.

Long term relapse prevention study 331-10-232
The primary efficacy endpoint in Trial 331-10-232 was the time from randomization to impending 
relapse. The prespecified interim analysis of efficacy data for time to impending relapse included 167 
randomized subjects and 45 events (50% of projected total of 90 events). The results of the interim 
analysis, which was performed by an independent committee, showed that time to impending relapse 
was statistically significantly delayed with brexpiprazole compared with placebo (p = 0.0008; log-rank 
test). The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard model for the brexpiprazole to placebo 
comparison was 0.338 (95% CI: 0.174, 0.655). Based on this outcome and prespecified criteria in the 
protocol, the independent committee recommended to terminate the trial. 
The final efficacy analysis included 53 impending relapse events in 200 randomized subjects included in 
the efficacy sample, of whom 13.54% of brexpiprazole and 38.46% of placebo subjects met the criteria 
for an impending relapse. The results were consistent with the interim analysis results in showing that 
time to impending relapse was statistically significantly delayed with brexpiprazole compared with 
placebo (p < 0.0001; log-rank test). The hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazard model for the 
placebo to brexpiprazole comparison in the final analysis was 0.292 (95% CI: 0.156, 0.548); thus, 
subjects in the brexpiprazole group had a 71% lower risk of experiencing impending relapse than the 
subjects in the placebo group. 
The percentage of subjects meeting the criteria for impending relapse at end of the Double-blind 
Maintenance phase in the interim analyses was significantly lower (p = 0.0016) in the brexpiprazole 
group (15.38%) than in the placebo group (37.08%). In the final analysis, the percentage of subjects 
meeting the impending relapse criteria was statistically significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in the 
brexpiprazole group (13.54%) than in the placebo group (38.46%). For both treatment groups in both 
the interim and final analyses, the most common criterion for impending relapse met was the CGI-I 
(overall improvement) + PANSS (symptom severity) scores criterion followed by hospitalization. 
Only 23 subjects met the stabilization criteria at doses of 1 or 2 mg. The majority of patients (between 
63% and 83%) were stable at the dose of 4 mg depending on the week of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 68/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Results of other secondary endpoints (evaluated for final analyses only) supported the efficacy of 
brexpiprazole 1 to 4 mg/day in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. These included a larger 
proportion of subjects meeting stability criteria, improvement in clinical symptomology (as assessed by 
PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I [ANOVA, LOCF]), improved functioning (as assessed by PSP and GAF scales 
[ANOVA, LOCF]), and prolonged time to trial discontinuation, as compared with placebo. 
The proportion of subjects who continued to meet criteria for stability at the last visit in the Double-blind 
Maintenance phase was 79.17% in the brexpiprazole group compared with 56.73% in the placebo 
group (p = 0.0007). The mean PANSS Total Score was maintained during the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase in subjects randomised to brexpiprazole; whereas, mean scores worsened for subjects 
randomized to placebo. Comparable results were observed in mean change from baseline on the PANSS 
Positive and Negative Subscale scores and Marder Factor scores, PEC, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores at 
endpoint. The PSP and GAF scales, which assess functioning, were supportive of the efficacy of 
brexpiprazole treatment, as was the time to trial discontinuation (for reasons other than termination of 
the trial for positive interim analysis).

Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Brexpiprazole (OPC-34712) as Maintenance 
Treatment in Adults with Schizophrenia 
Study identifier  331-10-232 
Design 
This was a phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to 
assess the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole as maintenance treatment in adults 
with schizophrenia. The trial consisted of a screening period during which eligibility 
criteria were assessed; a period for conversion from other antipsychotic(s) to oral 
brexpiprazole and washout of prohibited concomitant medications, if applicable; a 
single-blind treatment phase to stabilize subjects on oral brexpiprazole; a 
double-blind randomization phase to assess maintenance of effect, and a 
post-treatment follow-up for safety monitoring. 
Duration of screening phase:

O’Brian-Fleming spending function. An additional “final” analysis was 
performed including 8 impending relapse events occurred between the interim 
analysis cu-off date and the trial termination (last visit in the Double-blind

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy of brexpiprazole 2 and 4 mg was analysed across trials in a series of pool analyses which 
confirmed that PANSS change from baseline to week 6 was significantly different from placebo either 
when the dose of 2 mg and 4 mg were analysed in separate pools and also when the doses were pooled 
together. As stated earlier in the assessment, this difference confirms superiority of numerical 
improvement at the PANSS in the brexpiprazole group as compared to placebo but does not show a 
clear dose-response.  
If only the two global fixed dose trials are pooled, the dose response appears more pronounced 
(treatment effect −5.46 for 2 mg/day and −6.69 for 4 mg/day). 
A flatter dose response arises when pooling also regional trial 002; which may depend on differences in 
the gender and mean age distribution as compared to the global trials. For this reason the Applicant 
provided a post hoc analysis adding age and gender as fixed effects in the MMRM model.

In study 002, brexpiprazole 4 mg/day separates from placebo (p < 0.05) at Week 3 (−5.05, p = 
0.0337), Week 4 (−7.18, p = 0.0082), and Week 5 (−6.07, p = 0.0420). At Week 6, a trend towards 
statistical separation is observed (−5.59, p = 0.0710). 
Analyses by Region 
The Applicant presents subgroup analyses by Region, including Europe.  In the single trials analyses 
(primary endpoint), the following observations are made in relation to the European population:  
In trial 231, efficacy of both the 4 and the 2 mg dose is confirmed, with the 2 mg dose showing higher 
numerical improvement. 
In trial 230, efficacy of the 4 mg dose is confirmed only in the North American population but not in the 
EU population. 
In trial 14644A, despite the failure of brexpiprazole to demonstrate superiority to placebo, the 
numerical improvement in the EU population is superior to the numerical improvement in the North 
American population. 
Only 218 individuals (12.1%) of those included in the efficacy population are European. All EU patients 
are of white ethnic background, as compared to the ROW population which had different ethnic 
background. The proportion of males recruited in the EU population is smaller than the ROW population. 
Gender distribution and ethnicity are not thought to affect B/R in the small EU population of the 
program.  
Analyses by Age 
All short term trials enrolled subjects with an age included between 18 and 65 years. In all single trials 
sub-group analyses, a significantly lower proportion of subjects with more than 55 years of age were 
enrolled. Across the 4 short term trials, 12.3% were older than 55 years of age. From the data 
presented by the Applicant and considering the small sample, no interaction for age was found and data 
do not allow to assume a different B/R in the subgroup older than 55 years. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No efficacy studies have been conducted in elderly populations. Instead the applicant has submitted a 
subgroup analysis of change in PANSS total score by age for the 4 of the 6 efficacy studies (331-10-231, 
331-10-230, 331-10-002 and 14644A). Special populations have been looked into during the 
development programme primarily in terms of safety but not in terms of efficacy.  A paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP) has been agreed and its completion has been deferred to 2022. Study 
331-10-233 in adolescents is marked as ongoing and a synoptic report has been submitted. The current 
indication restricts the use of the product to adults and no paediatric data are available yet. The lack of 
specific efficacy data in the elderly is reported in the SmPC. 
Supportive studies 
No studies have been presented as supportive. 
In addition to the controlled trials the applicant has conducted following open label trials in patients with 
schizophrenia.

Some of the studies listed as the main have more supportive than pivotal role in the development 
programme. All studies listed in support of the claim of efficacy have been presented and assessed 
under the Main Studies heading above. 
The applicant has not made any claims regarding efficacy based on the open label studies. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy of brexpiprazole was studied in three 6 weeks, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled pivotal trials 
(331-10-231 and 331-10-230), one of which is a regional study conducted in Japan (331-10-002). In 
addition, another pivotal study was a six-weeks, flexible-dose study with active reference quetiapine 
(14644A). A relapse prevention study with a randomized withdrawal phase was conducted to assess 
long-term maintenance efficacy of brexpiprazole in schizophrenia (331-10-232). 
A 6-weeks dose-finding study with active reference aripiprazole was also conducted (203). The doses of 
brexpiprazole utilized in the phase 3 program ranged between 0.25 mg/day and 4 mg/day and were 
selected based on the collective efficacy, safety, and D2 occupancy data from a positron emission 
tomography (PET) trial in healthy subjects (Trial 331-07-202) and a phase 2 trial in adults with an 
acute relapse of schizophrenia (Trial 331-07-203). The results from the PET trial, predicted 
steady-state D2 receptor occupancies of 79.3% at brexpiprazole 1 mg/day, 88.8% at brexpiprazole 2 
mg/day, and 95.1% at brexpiprazole 4 mg/day. For a D2 partial agonist, ≥ 85% receptor occupancy is 
generally considered to be the threshold for a clinical effect versus a 65% to 80% threshold for D2 
antagonists.   
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 84/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the applicant conducted four pivotal studies out of which three were placebo-controlled 
despite the EMA Guidelines for the investigation of products for schizophrenia recommended a 
three-arm study of placebo, test product and active comparator. The lack of an active comparator arm 
in studies 331-10-231, 331-10-230 and 331-10-002 is a limitation for the efficacy assessment.  
The study 14644A is a flexible dose double blind placebo and active control study; this design is more 
informative, the active comparator is quetiapine, however, the most suitable comparator should have 
been aripiprazole. The Applicant states that the active reference was added only to confirm assay 
sensitivity and no comparison between brexpiprazole and quetiapine has been carried out. 
Each of the three fixed-dose trials investigated the efficacy and safety of the dose of 2mg/day and 
4mg/day, but also had a lower dose arm. With the exception of the 331-10-002 regional study, the 
randomization was imbalanced with fewer patients in the lower doses arms. In the 231 study the lower 
dose was 0.25mg (3:3:2:3 randomization), in the 230 study the lower dose was 1mg (2:2:1:2 
randomization) and in the 002 trial the lower dose was 1mg (1:1:1:1 randomization).  
The choice to investigate lower doses is appreciated because the minimum effective dose should be 
established. Indeed, from the PET studies it appears that brexpiprazole possesses a pharmacologic 
activity compatible with producing clinical effects already at the dose of 1mg. The titration scheme 
differs between the fixed dose trials (maximum dose of 4 mg is reached in 7 days) and the flexible dose 
trial (maximum dose of 4mg/day is reached in 4 days). In the latter, the titration scheme is faster to 
allow a comparison with the established quetiapine titration scheme.  
The fact that evidence of efficacy comes solely from the three fixed dose trials, implies that the 
maximum dose of 4mg/day should be reached through Day7, so modification to the SmPC 
recommendations were propsed and accepted by the Applicant 
All 4 short term trials have the same primary endpoint which is “change from baseline to week 6 in the 
PANSS total score”. The PANSS is an established and clinically meaningful endpoint and the choice of 
the same primary outcome measure for all trials allows comparability. As per Guidelines the CGI-S scale 
was chosen as a key secondary endpoint to allow assessment of clinical meaningfulness. 
The primary efficacy analysis, most of sensitivity analyses and secondary efficacy analyses, are 
comparable across trials. The MMRM with a MAR assumption was chosen as primary efficacy analysis.  
The protocol-specified primary efficacy endpoint for the fixed-dose, short-term trials (331-10-231, 
331-10-230, and 331-10-002) was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS Total Score. 
The PANSS Total Score was evaluated with assumption of missing data being missing at random (MAR) 
using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. The MMRM model with fixed-effect factors of 
trial site (global Trials 331-10-231 and 331-10-230 only), treatment, visit, treatment-visit interaction, 
and fixed-effect covariates of baseline and baseline-visit interaction was applied to the change from 
baseline from Week 1 to Week 6 based on all available data (observed cases [OC]).  
The data were modelled using an unstructured variance-covariance matrix for the within-subject 
variation. The statistical test of the least squares mean differences (LSMDs) between brexpiprazole at 
4 mg/day and 2 mg/day doses and placebo at Week 6 of the MMRM analysis served as the analysis of 
the primary efficacy endpoint. For the regional Trial 331-10-002, the MMRM model applied to the 
protocol-specified analysis did not include trial site as a factor; however, trial site was included in the 
comparison across trials. 
For Trial 14644A, the primary endpoint was analysed using the same MMRM model as for the fixed-dose 
Trials 331-10-231 and 331-10-230 with trial site, visit, and treatment as fixed effects, baseline score as 
a continuous covariate, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline score-by-visit interaction. An 
unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-subject errors. The Kenward-Roger 
approximation was used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom. The analysis was based on all 
available observations in the treatment period (from baseline to the completion/withdrawal visit) from 
the brexpiprazole, quetiapine, and the placebo treatment groups. The mean differences between 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 85/172 
 
 
 
 
 
brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day and placebo were estimated based on least squares (LS) means in the 
MMRM model. 
The primary statistical comparisons of interest for all efficacy analyses in the fixed-dose trials were 
brexpiprazole 4 mg/day versus (vs) placebo and brexpiprazole 2 mg/day vs placebo. In the 
flexible-dose Trial 14644A, the primary statistical comparison of interest for all efficacy analyses was 
the difference between brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day and placebo at Week 6. Although not part of the 
primary analysis, quetiapine vs placebo was analyzed for assay sensitivity using the same method 
described for the comparison of brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day vs placebo, which included all available 
observations in the treatment period from the brexpiprazole, quetiapine, and placebo groups. 
The Hochberg procedure was specified in the original protocols to control for multiplicity in the analysis 
of the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints in Trials 231 and 230 and in the analysis of the 
primary endpoint in Trial 002. The Hochberg procedure was replaced by the Average Effect method 
(stepwise procedure) to handle multiplicity in the analysis in Amendment 2 to protocols 231 and 230 
and Amendment 6 of protocol 002 while the trials were still blinded. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of trial results, since they are based on 
the MAR assumption. In the phase 3 short-term, placebo-controlled trials, sensitivity analyses for the 
MAR assumption were performed under various assumptions of selected data being missing not at 
random (MNAR). These analyses used Pattern Mixture Models based on multiple imputation (MI) with 
mixed missing data mechanisms. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) dataset was also performed in these trials to allow for comparison with legacy trials. 
Other secondary endpoints are: PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, PANSS Marder 
Factor, the CGI-I and the PSC functional scale. In addition proportion of responders and proportion of 
withdrawals due to lack of efficacy are included in the evaluation. All clinical continuous endpoints 
assessing the antipsychotic effect of brexpiprazole are based on the PANSS. Ideally primary and 
secondary endpoints should measure different concepts of interest so that they provide complementary 
and contextual information, rather than redundant information.  
The definition of response provided in the protocol uses either of the following criteria: ≥30% PANSS 
reduction OR CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). The Applicant provided also 
a sensitivity analysis with the proportion of responders who achieved a 40% or 50% reduction from 
baseline. 
The maintenance study is a relapse prevention study with a double blind randomized withdrawal phase 
where patients are randomized to flexible doses of brexpiprazole (1-4mg) and placebo after a 12 weeks 
stabilization phase.  
In this type of study the definition of impending relapse is of pivotal importance. The Applicant 
discussed the proposed definition and it was concluded that the definition of impending relapse (and not 
full relapse) was confirmed/reviewed by a Relapse Adjudication Committee and the definition is 
consistent with that of previous registrational trials (aripiprazole) and scientific literature. It is 
acknowledged that impending relapse, as opposed to relapse, is an endpoint that assures the safety of 
the subjects in the trial. 
Dose finding 
Study 331-07-203 is a dose finding study where doses from 0.25 up to 6 mg are tested. Aripiprazole 
flexible doses from 10 to 20 mg were used for assay sensitivity. The size of the samples for each dose 
arm are compatible with a phase 2 setting. 
Patients were selected with similar criteria as compared to the phase 3 studies.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in the PANSS Total score at week 6) was analyzed 
using ANCOVA in the LOCF dataset. This method is less conservative than the MMRM in this context, 
however results were confirmed also with the MMRM (efficacy sample).

This study could be regarded negative for both efficacy (superiority to placebo) and assay sensitivity: 
neither brexpiprazole, nor aripiprazole separated from placebo. This could be due to a greater than 
expected improvement in the placebo arm (LS mean change -13.77/-14.38, however this is only 
speculative. The higher numeric improvement in terms of reduction of PANSS total score, compared to 
placebo, was achieved with the flexible dose 0.5-1.5 mg (LS mean change -18.47) and the flexible 
interval 5±1 (LS mean change-18.02), although this was not statistically significant.  
The lower 0.25 dose and the flexible 2-3 mg dose groups showed a lower numerical improvement (LS 
mean change -9.76 and -15.22, respectively).  
A dose response is not clearly evident, which suggests a non-linear receptor occupancy between 1 and 
6 mg, which however is not confirmed in the PET study 331-09-219 at steady state (in patients) where 
relevant D2/D3 occupancy was observed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The first pivotal phase 3 study (331-10-231) supports efficacy of brexpiprazole at the doses of 2 and 4 
mg/day in terms of reduction of symptoms as measured by the PANSS.  
The mean reduction of PANSS total score at week 6 was -20.73 for the group treated with 2mg and was 
-19.65 for the group treated with 4mg, therefore the separation from placebo (LS mean -12) was 
statistically significant (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0006, respectively). Patients treated with the dose of 0.25 
improved minimally (LS mean change from baseline -14.90), although the power calculated for the 0.25 
arm was less than 70% (imbalanced randomization). 
Efficacy is also supported by the results at the key secondary endpoint change from baseline to week 6 
in the CGI-S score. The LS mean of the brexpiprazole 2mg treatment arm was -1.20 therefore the 
separation from placebo was statistically significant (P = 0.0056), the same applies for the 4mg 
treatment arm (LS mean -1.15), which separated significantly from placebo (p = 0.0012). Patients 
treated with the dose of 0.25 improved minimally (LS mean change from baseline -0.85).  
In study 331-10-231 the sample size of the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group was set at 90 subjects, 
resulting in a power less than 70%, the Applicant was not expecting a clinically meaningful effect at the 
dose of 0.25 mg and the imalanced randomization was motivated by safety/ethical reasons. 
The second phase 3 short term pivotal study (331-10-230) supports an effect of brexpiprazole in 
reducing schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS but only at the dose of 4 mg.  
During the trial, patients on brexpiprazole 4mg improved significantly after 6 weeks as compared to 
placebo patients (LS mean -20 points; -13.53, respectively). The groups treated with the dose of 1mg 
and 2 mg showed similar numeric improvement (-16.9, -16.6 respectively) despite this being not 
statistically significant. Of note, in this trial, the randomization was unbalanced and the 1 mg arm 
counted only 117 patients, this number however allowed a fully powered statistical analysis.  
The onset of efficacy, when measured at the PANSS, was already significant at week 1, but only in the 
4 mg arm. 
The difference in CGI-S scores between treatment and placebo showed a similar pattern where only 
patients in the 4mg arm separated significantly from placebo (-1.19 LS mean vs -0.81 treatment and 
placebo respectively). Numeric improvement in the 2mg and 1mg arms was similar. 
In the regional phase 3 study (331-10-002) results support the efficacy of brexpiprazole in reducing 
schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS but only at the dose of 2 mg.  
Several Amendments were implemented after trial initiation date (07 Dec 2011) and before trial 
Completion (07 Jul 2015). Amendments of 09 Oct 2012 and 24 Dec 2014 lead to several modifications 
in the analysis method. 
The Applicant provided the rationale and the content of all the amendments of the study 331-10-002, 
reassuring that all the changes in statistical analysis plan were done to match the revised protocol of the 
global trial (the bridging target trial). Moreover, the Applicant also provided the comparison of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018

results of the primary analysis conducted according to the final protocol, i.e. by MMRM and using 
multiple comparison procedure, with those of primary analysis as originally planned, i.e. ANCOVA model 
with LOCF imputation and the Hochberg procedure for the multiplicity control method (already available 
in the submitted documentation), in order to prove that the change did not impact on the conclusion of 
the study. The additional information is reassuring on the conduct of the analysis and on the conclusion 
of the study that remains unchanged. 
Of note, during this trial, the placebo group improved less than in the global studies (230&231) with a 
LS mean change at week 6 of -7.63 at the PANSS. The group treated with 2 mg improved substantially 
(LS mean change -14.95, p = 0.0124) and kept the statistical significance also with the Hochberg 
procedure. This difference appeared at week 3 of treatment and remained through the study period. 
The group treated with 4 mg improved less (-3.86 difference from placebo, not statistically significant). 
The lowest numerical improvement was observed in the group treated with 1mg. 
Analyses of the CGI-S showed no significant difference from placebo and this is a key element to judge 
efficacy. Of note, it is reminded that since in the primary analysis, only the 2 mg dose arm showed 
statistically significant separation from placebo, secondary analyses can be considered only supportive 
from a statistical point of view. 
In a clinical perspective, it is noted that the analyses of secondary outcomes shows an effect on the 
negative symptoms domain, both at the PANSS negative subscale (LS mean was −3.48 in the 2 mg 
group and −3.24 in the 4 mg group, vs −1.20 in the placebo group) and at the Marder factor score 
negative symptoms where the 2 and 4 mg groups separated from placebo; the 2 mg group separated 
from placebo also in the disorganized though factor. In the positive symptom factor there was no 
separation from placebo. 
To assess the comparability of the results between the regional and the global trials, the frequencies of 
UR, EM, IM and PM (for the CYP2D6 genotype) were calculated and resulted highly comparable, 
therefore it is unlikely that the inconsistency of the pivotal efficacy results with respect to brexpiprazole 
doses may depend on pharmacogenomic issues.   
Additional  analyses  of the regional  Japanese  trial revealed  that gender distribution  and mean age 
differed as compared to the global trials. As such, a posthoc analysis was conducted to further explore 
these differences.  The results  of this analysis show that when age and gender  are added as fixed 
effects  to the MMRM  model, brexpiprazole  4 mg/day separates  from placebo  (p < 0.05) at Week 3 
(−5.05, p = 0.0337), Week 4 (−7.18, p = 0.0082), and Week 5 (−6.07, p = 0.0420). At Week 6, a 
trend towards statistical  separation  is observed  (−5.59,  p = 0.0710).  
In the flexible dose, active and placebo controlled study 14644A, the group treated with the dose range 
of 2-4 mg brexpiprazole failed to separate from placebo at the primary endpoint. Placebo patients 
showed a reduction in PANSS total scores at week 6 of -15.9 (higher than what seen in the fixed dose 
phase 3 trials), therefore the improvement with brexpiprazole (LS mean change -20) was not sufficient 
to achieve statistical difference, whilst patients treated with flexible doses of quetiapine XR improved on 
average by -24 points therefore this different was statistically significant in comparison to placebo.  
The failure of the brexpiprazole group to separate from placebo was confirmed in several sensitivity 
analyses, however when using OC ANCOVA or LOCF ANCOVA the results were statistically significant. It 
is to be noted that the ANCOVA is not considered a conservative approach in this context.  
When measuring the differences in reduction of PANSS total scores between the brexpiprazole group 
and the placebo group at weeks 2, 3 and 4, the difference was statistically significant, confirming an 
onset of therapeutic effect at week two, like most antipsychotics. 
The difference in CGI-S scores between the brexpiprazole group and placebo was statistically significant 
(LS mean -1.2 vs -0.9 for placebo, p = 0.0142), although the numeric improvement was slightly inferior 
to that of the quetiapine group (LS mean -1.4, p = 0.0002). However, the primary and the key 
Assessment report  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 88/172 
 
 
 
 
 
 
secondary endpoints had to be tested hierarchically. Therefore, since the primary endpoint was not 
statistically significant (p = 0.056), the analysis of the key secondary endpoint should not to be formally 
considered.   
A limitation in the assessment of efficacy comes from the fact that both active comparator studies 203 
(dose response) and 14644A were negative for brexpiprazole. While in study 203 a comparison between 
brexpiprazole and ariprazole was not possible, in study 14644A assay sensitivity was demonstrated and 
in all comparisons, including the sensitivity analyses, the magnitude of PANSS scores reduction was 
greater for the quetiapine group than for the brexpiprazole group.  
The applicant carried out additional analyses of responders and looked into significance of CGI-I and 
Personal and Social Performance scale scores. The responder analysis uses relative risk to demonstrate 
that both quetiapine and brexpiprazole differentiate from placebo, which is shown for reduction in 
PANSS scores ≥30% and ≥40% but not for ≥50% which failed for both active treatments. The change 
in Personal and Social Performance scale and CGI-I are statistically significant.

In addition to the pre-specified analyses assuming missing data to be MNAR, to further investigate the 
potential impact of missing data being MNAR in the conclusions of these trials, an estimand of 
treatment-policy with a hypothetical strategy as if other medications had not been available for use was 
considered. In this estimand, all subjects who discontinued brexpiprazole are considered as falling ‘back 
to placebo’ from the time of discontinuation onwards because of the intended symptomatic 
improvement of the trial medication. Thus, missing data were imputed using placebo based multiple 
imputation (PMI) to construct back to placebo analysis for all subjects who discontinued, ie, in addition 
to missing data in placebo group, missing observations in the brexpiprazole groups were imputed

following a model not from the observed data in brexpiprazole groups but rather from the observed data 
in the placebo group. 
As shown in Table , the PMI ‘back to placebo’ analysis of the primary endpoint of change from baseline 
in PANSS Total Score to Week 6 showed consistent results and a similar magnitude of treatment effect 
(point estimate)  as that observed in the pre-specified MMRM primary analysis. So do the CGI and most 
secondary endpoints.

Maintenance of effect was investigated in the relapse prevention trial (331-10-232). 
The study was stopped at the first interim analysis for demonstration of efficacy, indeed, relapses were 
significantly delayed in the brexpiprazole group as compared to placebo (p = 0.0008) and subjects 
treated with brexpiprazole had 66% lower risk of experiencing impending relapse compared to placebo.  
The criteria pre-specified needed for making an efficacy claim at the first interim analysis in study 232 
were met. The interim analysis was conducted when 45 events occurred (13 Oct 2014)  and a final 
analysis was also performed based on 53 events as additional 8 impending relapse events occurred 
during the time period from 13 Oct 2014 to 14 Jan 2015 (last visit in the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase).

In addition, it was initially unclear if subjects randomized to placebo had been discontinued from 
brexpiprazole abruptly or gradually. The Applicant clarified that acute events or any reaction that could 
be attributable to a rebound effect were unlikely to have contributed to the results of study 232, even 
though treatment discontinuation was abrupt. First of all brexpiprazole has a long half-life; second, the 
Kaplan Meier curves started separating after 28 days and; third, events that occurred in the first 4 
weeks of the double blind phase were censored in a sensitivity analysis which is presented.  
The sensitivity analysis demonstrated efficacy in maintenance of treatment effect similarly to the 
primary analysis, with time to impending relapse significantly delayed with brexpiprazole as compared 
to placebo (p = 0.0003). 
The overall discontinuation rate from the Stabilization Phase was 56.5% (262 of 464 subjects). Of all 
subjects  who discontinued  from the trial, approximately  38% (176 of 464) discontinued  due to a 
specific cause while the remaining 18.5% (86 of 464) discontinued due to sponsor termination of the 
trial. The most frequently  reported  reasons  for discontinuation  due to a specific  cause from the 
Stabilization  Phase  were:  subject  withdrew  consent  to participate (n = 60; 12.9%),  AE without 
impending relapse (n = 43; 9.3%), subject met (protocol-specified) withdrawal criteria (n = 22; 4.7%) 
and lack of efficacy  (n = 21; 4.5%). 
Results of other secondary endpoints (evaluated for final analyses only) supported the efficacy of 
brexpiprazole 1 to 4 mg/day in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. These included a larger 
proportion of subjects meeting stability criteria, improvement in clinical symptomology (as assessed by 
PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I [ANOVA, LOCF]), improved functioning (as assessed by PSP and GAF scales 
[ANOVA, LOCF]), and prolonged time to trial discontinuation, as compared with placebo. 
The proportion of subjects who continued to meet criteria for stability at the last visit in the Double-blind 
Maintenance phase was 79.17% in the brexpiprazole group compared with 56.73% in the placebo 
group (p = 0.0007). The mean PANSS Total Score was maintained during the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase in subjects randomised to brexpiprazole; whereas, mean scores worsened for subjects 
randomized to placebo. Comparable results were observed in mean change from baseline on the PANSS 
Positive and Negative Subscale scores and Marder Factor scores, PEC, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores at 
endpoint. The PSP and GAF scales, which assess functioning, were supportive of the efficacy of 
brexpiprazole treatment, as was the time to trial discontinuation (for reasons other than termination of 
the trial for positive interim analysis). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Evidence of efficacy for brexpiprazole comes from the three short-term, placebo-controlled pivotal 
studies 331-10-231, 331-10-230, 331-10-002. The first pivotal phase 3 study (231) supports efficacy 
of brexpiprazole at the doses of 2 and 4 mg/day in terms of reduction of symptoms as measured by the 
PANSS and confirmed by the CGI, key secondary endpoint. The second phase 3 short term pivotal study 
(230) supports an effect of brexpiprazole in reducing schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the 
PANSS but only at the dose of 4 mg. In the regional phase 3 study (002) results support the efficacy of 
brexpiprazole in reducing schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS but only at the dose of 
2 mg. In the flexible dose, active and placebo controlled study 14644A, the group treated with the dose 
range of 2-4 mg brexpiprazole failed to separate from placebo at the primary endpoint, whilst patients 
treated with flexible doses of quetiapine XR improved in a statistically significant fashion. The numerical 
improvement as measured by mean reduction of PANSS scores is similar in all global trials and 
considered clinically relevant.  
The assumptions on the missing data handling, should provide a realistic description of the treatment 
effect to enable patients and prescribers to make informed choices at point of prescription. For this 
reason the Applicant presented a secondary analysis using an MMRM approach with PMI imputation.

Results from the primary and secondary analysis were consistent and results showed a similar 
magnitude of treatment effect (point estimates) for primary and secondary endpoints. 
The relapse prevention trial (232), was stopped at the first interim analysis for demonstration of 
efficacy. A clear dose-response was not observed in the short term studies, which is compatible with 
results from similar development programs of antipsychotics, a dose response curve is evident when 
pooling the two global trials A concern in the assessment of efficacy arises also from the fact that both 
active comparator studies 203 (dose response) and 14644A were negative for brexpiprazole. While in 
study 203 a comparison between brexpiprazole and ariprazole was not possible, in study 14644A assay 
sensitivity was demonstrated and in all comparisons, including the sensitivity analyses, the magnitude 
of PANSS scores reduction was greater for the quetiapine group than for the brexpiprazole group. No 
further direct comparisons with other second-generation antipsychotics are available.

Table 16 Summary of Subject Disposition (Randomized Sample: Short-term, Controlled 
Trials –Schizophrenia) 
The three fixed-dose short term schizophrenia trials included 1284 patients treated with brexpiprazole 
(0.25 mg: n=90; 1 mg: n=235; 2 mg: n= 482; 4 mg: n= 477) and 484 patients treated with PBO. 
In the five short-term, controlled trials, the mean (SD) brexpiprazole dose for those 1199 subjects 
randomized to receive a dose in the range of 2 to 4 mg/day was 2.7 mg/day (0.8). For the all 
brexpiprazole treatment group, the most frequent modal and final dose was brexpiprazole 4 mg/day. 
In the flexible dose 6 weeks controlled study 14644A (active reference quetiapine XR), the average 
modal and mean doses of brexpiprazole were 3.8 mg/day and 3.5 mg/day, respectively, and the 
average modal and mean doses of quetiapine were 697 mg/day and 674 mg/day, respectively. 83% of 
the patients in the brexpiprazole group and 65% of the patients in the quetiapine group reached the 
high dose of IMP. 
In the fixed dose Phase 2 Study 331-07-203 (active reference aripiprazole XR), the average daily dose 
at the end of double-blind treatment was as follows: 0.25 mg in the 0.25 mg/day in the brexpiprazole 
fixed-dose group; 1.30 mg in the 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/day brexpiprazole group; 2.74 mg in the 2.5 ± 0.5 
mg/day brexpiprazole group; 5.45 mg in the 5.0 ± 1.0 mg/day brexpiprazole group; 16.58 mg in the 
aripiprazole 15 ± 5 mg/day group. In addition to double-blind treatment, 65 subjects received 
open-label brexpiprazole for ≤ 21 days in the non-responder open-label arm. More than half of the 
subjects who entered the open-label arm (40/65 subjects, 61.5%) received brexpiprazole for a duration 
of 15 to 21 days. The average daily dose of brexpiprazole during open-label treatment was 2.79 mg.

Table 18 Extent of Exposure(Cumulative) in Double-blind, Maintenance Phase C of Trial 
331-10-232 (Randomised Sample) 
The majority of subjects were exposed to brexpiprazole for a duration of 12 to 18 weeks during the 
Stabilization phase. During the Double-blind Maintenance phase, the majority of subjects had a 
cumulative exposure to IMP in the range of 2 weeks up to 28 weeks due to the early termination of the 
trial by the sponsor following the positive results of the interim analysis; no more than approximately 
30% of subjects had a cumulative exposure ≥ 32 weeks. The last visit mean average daily dose of 
brexpiprazole was 3.427 mg for all subjects in the Stabilization phase and 3.557 mg for all subjects 
randomized to brexpiprazole in the Double-blind Maintenance phase. The mean modal dose was 3.567 
mg/day, and the most common modal dose for subjects randomized to brexpiprazole was 4 mg/day (64 
subjects, 66%), followed by 3 mg/day (25 subjects, 25.8%).

Exposure in Long-term, Open-label Trials Group – Schizophrenia 
Table 19 Treatment Duration and Overall Exposure (Safety Sample: Long-term, Open-label 
Trials –Schizophrenia) 
In the long term, open label trials, the mean (SD) brexpiprazole dose was 3.1 mg/day (0.8). The mean 
(SD) dose in the completer population was 3.2 mg/day (0.8). The most frequent modal dose overall was 
4 mg/day  
(n = 663, 46.5% of subjects), followed by 2 mg/day (n = 442, 31.0% of subjects). At their final dose, 
the largest proportions of subjects had brexpiprazole 4 mg/day (n =702, 49.3%) or 2 mg/day (n = 368, 
25.8%). For the completer population, the most frequent modal doses were also 4 mg/day (52.9%), 
and 2 mg/day and 3 mg/day (both 22.2%); the 2 most frequent final doses were 4 mg/day (52.7%) and 
3 mg/day (22.2%). 
The mean brexpiprazole dose by treatment duration reached 3.22 mg/day among subjects with ≥ 4 
weeks of exposure, and 3.28 mg/day among subjects with ≥ 52 weeks of exposure. The overall mean 
dose was 2.99 mg/day, and the mean endpoint dose (last nonmissing dose taken during the trial) was 
3.29 mg/day.

Table 20 Composition of Long-term, Open-label Trials Group 
Of the 1426 subjects who received brexpiprazole in the long term, open label trials, 428 were enrolled 
in North America, 574 in Europe, 334 in Asia, and 90 in Latin America. The percentage of subjects who 
discontinued from the trials was higher for subjects enrolled at sites in North America (68.5%) than 
subjects at sites in Europe (43.2%), Latin America (52.2%), and Asia (47.0%). Frequently cited 
reasons for discontinuation in all regions were “AEs” and “withdrawal of consent.” Subjects withdrawing 
because they “met protocol specified withdrawal criteria” was the primary difference in discontinuation 
rates between sites in North America and other regions, with a higher percentage of subjects at North 
American sites withdrawing for this reason (14.0%) than at sites in Europe (1.4%), Latin America 
(4.4%), and Asia (3.0%). A higher percentage of US subjects met the withdrawal criteria for illicit 
substance abuse (7.0%)  and/or noncompliance with visit windows (5.6%), resulting in a larger 
proportion of US subjects being withdrawn from the trials, compared with subjects from the rest of the 
World.

Exposure in the All Brexpiprazole Trials Group 
Table 22 Treatment Duration and Overall Exposure (Saftey Sample: All Brexpiprazole Trials 
Group) 
Overall, 2263 subjects were exposed to 1 mg (< 1.5 mg) brexpiprazole across indications 
(schizophrenia, MDD, ADHD, PTSD). The majority of subjects (n = 4459) were exposed to brexpiprazole 
within the proposed therapeutic dose range (2 to 4 mg/day); 1981 subjects were exposed to 2 mg (≥ 
1.5 to < 2.5 mg) doses, 1574 subjects were exposed to 3 mg (≥ 2.5 to < 3.5 mg) doses, and 904 
subjects were exposed to 4 mg (≥ 3.5 to ≤ 4.5 mg) doses of brexpiprazole. A total of 298 subjects 
received doses of brexpiprazole > 4 mg (> 4.5 mg). 
Exposure in Clinical Pharmacology Trials 
Across all the clinical pharmacology trials, 877 subjects received treatment with brexpiprazole either 
alone or concomitantly with another product (eg, antidepressant therapy or stimulant). Across the 
trials, the majority of the subjects were exposed to a dose of brexpiprazole 1 to 4 mg/day. 
Overall, a majority (88.8%) of the subjects completed the trials. The most frequently reported reasons 
for discontinuation were “withdrawal of consent” (4.3%) and “AEs” (3.3%). Trial 331-08-206 was 
terminated by the sponsor before completion of the trial because the protocol-specified tolerability 
criteria were met for the 3 mg dose. Enrollment and dosing in Trial 331-08-208 Group 4 were 
terminated prior to completion of the trial by the sponsor; no safety concerns were identified.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events in Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the Single-blind Stabilization phase of Trial 331-10-232 (Phase B) a total of 464 subjects were 
treated with brexpiprazole (1 - 4 mg/day). Of these subjects, 267 (57.5%) had TEAEs during the 
Stabilization phase. The most frequently occurring TEAEs (≥5% of subjects) were insomnia (12.1%), 
akathisia (9.1%), agitation (6.5%), schizophrenia (6.0%), weight increased (5.2%), and headache 
(5.0%).  
During the Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232, the most frequently occurring TEAEs 
in the brexpiprazole group were headache (6.2%) and insomnia (5.2%), both of which occurred at a 
higher incidence in the placebo group. The most frequently occurring TEAEs in the placebo group were 
headache (9.6%), insomnia (7.7%), schizophrenia (6.7%), nasopharyngitis (6.7%), and psychotic 
disorder (5.8%). Events reported in ≥ 2% of subjects in the brexpiprazole group with a higher incidence 
relative to placebo, included tremor, pruritus, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, muscle spasm, 
and toothache. The incidence of TEAEs in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC was 9.3% in the brexpiprazole 
group compared with 24.0% in the placebo group.

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the brexpiprazole group were schizophrenia, weight increased, 
insomnia, and headache, similar to the short-term trials. The incidence of subjects with weight 
increased was higher in the population of subjects who completed 52-weeks of treatment (12.5% of 
completer’s vs 8.5% of safety sample) than in the pooled population that included subjects who were 
treated for a shorter time period. Conversely, the incidence of subjects with schizophrenia was lower in 
the population of subjects who completed 52-weeks of treatment (2.9% of completer’s vs 14.2% of 
safety sample) than in the pooled population that included subjects who were treated for a shorter time 
period. 
Table 29: TEAEs Reported by At Least 5% of Subjects by SOC and PT (Safety Sample: 
Long-term, Open-label Trials - Schizophrenia) 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Severity 
In the Short term controlled trials severe TEAEs occurred in 6.6%, 5.4%, 8.6% and 6.6% of 
subjects in the brexpiprazole < 2 mg/ day, 2 to 4 mg/day, brexpiprazole >4 mg/ day and placebo 
groups, respectively.  
Most of the severe TEAEs reported by more than 1 subject in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group 
were in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC and included schizophrenia (3.2% vs 4.3%), agitation (0.7% vs 
0.5%), psychotic disorder (0.3% vs 0.5%), and insomnia (0.3% vs 0.1% in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 
mg/day and placebo groups respectively). Other severe TEAEs experienced by more than 1 subject in 
the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group were blood CPK increased (3 subjects [0.3%] and 1 subject 
[0.1%], in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day and placebo groups, respectively), psychomotor 
hyperactivity (2 subjects [0.2%] and 1 subject [0.1%], respectively), and rhabdomyolysis (2 subjects 
[0.2%] and 0 subjects, respectively).  
In the 3 Phase 3 Fixed dose trials, the incidence of severe TEAEs was lower with higher doses (10.0%, 
6.4%, 5.0%, and 4.6% in the brexpiprazole 0.25, 1 mg, 2, and 4 mg/day groups, respectively), and 
most groups had a lower incidence than in placebo (7.6%). 
In the 3 Phase 3 Fixed dose trials, apart from severe TEAEs in the psychiatric disorders SOC (agitation, 
insomnia, psychotic disorders, schizophrenia), no severe TEAE by PT occurred in more than one subject.  
In the Single-blind Stabilization phase of Trial 331-10-232 severe TEAEs occurred in 4.1% of subjects 
and in the Double-blind Maintenance phase severe TEAEs occurred in 2 [2.1%] brexpiprazole treated 
subjects (severe insomnia and decreased appetite) and 3 [2.9%] placebo treated subjects (severe 
psychotic disorder, suicidal ideation, and hypertension).

In the long-term open-label trials, severe TEAEs were reported in 7.4% of subjects. Most severe TEAEs 
were related to the underlying condition: schizophrenia (3.9%), psychotic disorder (0.6%), and 
agitation (0.4%). The only other severe TEAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject were weight 
increased (2 subjects, 0.1%), akathisia (2 subjects, 0.1%), suicidal ideation (2 subjects, 0.1%), and 
peritonitis (2 subjects, 0.1%, in one case fatal). 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Potentially Related to Investigational Medicinal 
Product 
In the short term controlled trials TEAEs potentially related to IMP occurred in 34.3%, 55,9% and 33% 
respectively in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg, brexpiprazole >4 mg and placebo treated subjects respectively. 
TEAEs potentially related to IMP occurred more frequently in the SOCs Nervous System Disorders, 
Psychiatric disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders. The most frequent TEAEs potentially related to IMP 
by PT, that occurred in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg treated patients more frequently than in PBO, with a 
difference form PBO >0.5%, were: akathisia (4.9% vs 3.6%), weight increased (3.3% vs 1.8%), 
tremor (2.3% vs 0.7%), sedation (1.7% vs 0.8%), extrapiramidal disorders (1.5% vs 0.8%) and 
dizziness (1.4% vs 0.8%). 
In the fixed dose Phase 3 trials, a dose relationship was observed for TEAE assessed as potentially 
related to IMP (26.8%, 29.9%, 35.6%, of subjects in the brexpiprazole 1, 2, and 4 mg/day groups 
respectively, compared to 30.8% in placebo groups). These events were primarily in the Nervous 
System Disorders (11.1%, 15.4%, 19.3%, of subjects in the brexpiprazole 1, 2, and 4 mg/day groups 
respectively, compared to 13.4% in the placebo group), Psychiatric Disorders (8.5%, 8.9%, 10.7%of 
subjects in the brexpiprazole 1, 2, and 4 mg/day groups respectively, compared to 9.1% in placebo 
group), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (3.8%, 7.3%, 7.8%, and 7.9% of subjects in the brexpiprazole 
1, 2, and 4 mg/day, and placebo groups, respectively) SOCs, and consisted of events such as headache, 
akathisia, insomnia, schizophrenia, agitation, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, and diarrhea. 
In the 3 Phase 3 Fixed dose trials, among Potentially Drug Related TEAEs that occurred in at least 1% 
of subjects in the All Brexpiprazole Group and with a frequency higher than PBO, all TEAEs occurred 
more frequently in the brexpiprazole 4 mg group compared with lower doses (akathisia: 3.0%, 3.9%, 
5.7%, and 3.9%; extrapyramidal disorders: 0.4%, 0.6%, 2.5% and 0.6%; sedation: 0.9%, 0.6%, 
2.1% and 0.2%; dizziness: 0.9%, 0.6%, 1.9% and 0.6%; weight increased: 1.3%, 2.1%, 3.1% and 
1.2%; blood creatinine phosphokinase increased: 1.3%, 0.6%, 1.5% and 0.6% in the brexpiprazole 1 
mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and placebo groups, respectively) apart from tremor and somnolence that occurred 
with similar frequency in the brexpiprazole 4 mg group compared with lower doses. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events in Long-term Trials 
In the Single-blind Stabilization phase, a third of all subjects (33.2%) had potentially drug-related 
TEAEs, most of which were associated with the Nervous System Disorders (20.5%) or Psychiatric 
Disorders (9.5%) SOCs. Akathisia (8.2%) and insomnia (5.8%) were the most frequently occurring 
potentially drug-related TEAEs. 
In the Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232 subjects treated with brexpiprazole had a 
lower incidence of potentially treatment-related TEAEs (14.4%) compared with subjects who received 
placebo (24.0%), primarily due to a lower incidence of potentially treatment-related Nervous System 
Disorders (7.2% vs 12.5%) and Psychiatric Disorders (4.1% vs 7.7%). Among TEAE assessed as 
potentially drug-related reported in at least 2% of subjects that occurred in the brexpiprazole group at 
a frequency higher than PBO was tremor (3.1% vs 0%). 
The percentage of subjects in the long-term, open-label trials who reported an event that was assessed 
by the investigator as potentially related to IMP was 37.1%. Weight increased (7.4%), akathisia 
(5.4%), insomnia (3.9%), schizophrenia (2.9%), headache (2.5%), somnolence (2.3%), tremor

(2.3%), extrapyramidal disorder (1.3%), dyskinesia (1.2%), and agitation (1.1%) were the most 
frequently reported (≥ 1% of subjects) TEAEs assessed as potentially related to IMP. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Time of First Onset in long term open label trials 
The time intervals used for analysis of the incidence of first onset of any TEAE in the long-term open 
lable trials were as follows:< 8 weeks (n = 1426); ≥ 8 weeks but < 14 weeks (n = 1118); ≥ 14 weeks 
but < 26 weeks  
(n = 998); ≥26 weeks but < 52 weeks (n = 849); ≥ 52 weeks (n = 458).  
The incidence of first onset of any TEAE was higher at < 8 weeks (43.5%) than at the subsequent time 
intervals (23.3%, 31.5%, 37.3%, and 11.6%, respectively).  
In the Psychiatric disorders SOC, the following frequencies were observed by time intervals: 16.2%, 
5.99%, 7.01%, 12.01%, 2.18% at onset time intervals < 8 weeks; ≥ 8 weeks but < 14 weeks; ≥ 14 
weeks but < 26 weeks; ≥26 weeks but < 52 weeks, >52 weeks). The PT with the higher frequency of 
AE was schizophrenia, with the following frequencies observed by time intervals: 5.82%, 2.50%, 
3.71%, 5.77%, 1.31% at onset time intervals < 8 weeks; ≥ 8 weeks but < 14 weeks; ≥ 14 weeks but 
< 26 weeks; ≥26 weeks but < 52 weeks, ≥52 weeks).   
AEs of weight increased presented the following distribution by time interval: 1.96%, 2.24%, 3.31%, 
and 3.89% at onset time intervals < 8 weeks; ≥ 8 weeks but < 14 weeks; ≥ 14 weeks but < 26 weeks; 
≥26 weeks but < 52 weeks). The frequency in the time interval ≥52 weeks was 0.66%. When patients 
were separated in groups according to prior treatment received, a higher frequency of reported events 
of weight increased with increasing exposure is most markedly seen in the prior brexpiprazole group, 
where reporting frequencies ranged from 1.82% to 6.17% for exposures of less than 8 weeks and 26 to 
52 weeks, respectively. 
In the time interval ≥52 weeks (n = 458) two events (0.4%) of tardive diskinesia occurred, compared 
to no events at earlier time intervals. 
AEs of Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, presented the following distribution by time intervals: 3 events 
(0.21%) <8 weeks, 0 events >8->14 weeks, 1 event (0.10%) >14-<26 weeks, 3 events (0.35%)  ≥26 
weeks -< 52 weeks, 0 events ≥52 weeks. 
AEs of Prolactin increased presented the following distribution by time intervals: 3 events (0.21%) <8 
weeks, 1 event (0.09%) >8->14 weeks, 3 events (0.30%) >14-<26 weeks, 6 events (0.71%)  ≥26 
weeks -< 52 weeks, 0 events ≥52 weeks.

Note:  Search criteria for TEAEs of interest (PTs) are presented in Appendix 5 of the SCS Statistical

once in total SOC row. 
Source:  Module 5.3.5.3, SCS, Appendix 4, CT-ST-SZ-6.9.1.4, CT-ST-SZ-7.6.3, CT-ST-SZ-7.9.3, CT- 
ST-SZ-7.10.3, CT-ST-SZ-7.13.3, CT-ST-SZ-7.16.3, and CT-ST-SZ-9.3.2.2. 
Effect on glucose and on lipids were analysed in the following ways (besides being components of 
metabolic syndrome): 1) changes over time for metabolic parameters; 2) potentially clinically relevant 
changes (PCR) in metabolic parameters; 3) treatment-emergent shifts in glucose and lipids from 
normal at baseline to high at last visit; 4) TEAEs associated with glucose and lipids.  
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus 
In short term controlled trials, differences form placebo in the percentage of subjects meeting values of 
Potential Clinical Relevance for fasting glucose (>100 mg/dl) (37.5% vs 24.9%) and in the proportions 
of patients with shifts in fasting glucose from normal (<100 mg/dL) to high (≥126 mg/dL) to high (8.8% 
vs 3.1% respectively) were observed only for the brexpiprazole >4 mg dose group. 
However, in the maintenance phase of the long-term controlled trial 331-10-232, a higher frequency of 
patients treated with brexpiprazole (1-4 mg) experienced shifts in fasting glucose from normal to high 
(4.55%) and from normal or impaired (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to high (3.8%), compared to PBO group 
(0 and 1.3%, respectively), and a slightly higher frequency  of subjects met values of Potential Clinical 
Relevance in fasting glucose [20/89 (22.5%)  in the brexpiprazole 1-4 mg  , compared to 17/88 
(19.3%) in the PBO group]. 
In long-term open-label trials, the percentages of subjects meeting Potential Clinical Relevance criteria 
for fasting glucose was higher (44.2%)  and the percentages of subjects with shifts in fasting glucose 
from normal to high (6.1%) and from normal or impaired to high (16.94%) was higher than those seen 
in the short-term trials. 
The TEAEs included in the search for effects of brexpiprazole treatment on glucose were based on the 
Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA] Query [SMQ]) narrow search for 
hyperglycemia plus terms from the broad list.   
In short term controlled trials, the incidence of TEAEs related to blood glucose were reported by a 
similar proportion of subjects across treatment groups (0.4% brexpiprazole 2-4 mg vs 0.5% PBO). One 
serious TEAE of type 2 diabetes mellitus (from study 14644A, Patient) has been reported in 1 subject in 
the 2-4 mg dose group, in a who was diagnosed with moderate type II diabetes mellitus 20 days after 
the first dose of IMP. The event was considered by the investigator as related to IMP. BMI was obesewith 
no other relevant medical history. blood glucose was 5.9mmol/L at the Screening Visit; it increased 
during the study and was 6.7mmol/L at the Baseline Visit, 14.3mmol/L at Visit 6, and 17.7mmol/L at the 
Completion Visit. The HbA1c was 6.2% at the Screening Visit and 10% at the Completion Visit. Urine 
glucose was negative at both the Screening and Baseline Visits. However, it was 3+ at the Completion 
Visit. completed the study but the outcome of the event was not recovered. 
In the Stabilization phase of trial 331-10-232, TEAEs related to metabolic parameters were diabetes 
mellitus (n = 1), hyperglycemia (n = 1), hypoglycemia (n = 1), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 4). 
Assessment report

None of these TEAEs were serious or resulted in discontinuation. In the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase, TEAEs related to blood glucose were reported by none of the subjects treated with brexpiprazole 
and by 1 subject in the placebo group.  
In long term open label trials, treatment-emergent AEs related to blood glucose were reported by 22 
subjects (1.5%) and 3 subjects (0.2%) were discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE related to blood 
glucose. The TEAEs reported by more than 1 subject were type 2 diabetes mellitus (9 subjects [0.6%]), 
blood glucose increased (5 subjects [0.4%]), 3 subjects each (0.2%) with hyperglycemia and diabetes 
mellitus, 2 subjects each (0.1%) with glycosylated hemoglobin increased and glucose tolerance 
impaired. All of the TEAEs related to blood glucose were considered to be not serious in the opinion of 
the investigator. 
Ongoing Trials 
In ongoing open-label MDD Trial 331-10-238, TEAEs of glycosylated haemoglobin increased and type 2 
diabetes mellitus led to discontinuation of IMP for 3 subjects each; of these events leading to 
discontinuation, 1 event of type 2 diabetes mellitus was considered serious. Other TEAEs associated 
with glucose or lipid metabolism that led to discontinuation of IMP were reported in 1 subject each (PTs: 
blood glucose increased, blood triglycerides increased, and glucose tolerance impaired). 
Dyslipidemia 
In short term controlled trials and in the double blind maintenance phase of the long term trial 
331-10-232 there were no relevant differences between brexpiprazole treatment groups and PBO in the 
percentage of subjects meeting Potential Clinical Relevance criteria for fasting lipids (total cholesterol 
fasting ≥240 mg/dl; LDL cholesterol fasting ≥160 mg/dl; HDL cholesterol fasting <40 mg/dl men and < 
50 mg/ dl women;  triglicerid fasting ≥150 mg/dl). However, in the long-term, open-label trials the 
percentages of subjects meeting Potential Clinical Relevance criteria for metabolic parameters were 
higher than those seen in the short-term trials. 
In the fixed-dose trials treatment emergent shifts in fasting lipids from normal at baseline to 
borderline/high at last visit showed a higher frequency for the 4 mg dose group compared to PBO, for 
fasting total cholesterol [from <200 mg/ dl to ≥200: 23.9% vs 16.2%); fasting LDL (from <100 mg/ dl 
to ≥100: 38% vs 29.4%); for fasting triglycerides from normal (<150 mg/ dl) to high (200- <500)  
(8.3% vs 4.6%). One subject in the brexpiprazole 4 mg group presented shifts in fasting triglycerides 
from normal at baseline (<150 mg/ dl) to very high (≥500 mg/dl) at last visit, compared to no such 
events occurring in the PBO group or with lower brexpiprazole doses. In the overall “Short term 
controlled” safety sample, the incidences of treatment-emergent shifts for fasting LDL from normal 
(<100 mg/ dl) to borderline/ high (≥100) showed a higher frequency in brexpiprazole treated subjects 
compared to PBO (brexpiprazole 2-4 mg: 33.7%; >4 mg 34.3%; PBO: 31.1%).  
A higher frequency was observed in the brexpiprazole >4 mg group compared to PBO in 
treatment-emergent shifts for fasting triglycerides from normal (<150 mg/ dl) to high (200- <500)  
(60%, 6/10; vs 36.4%, 36/99) and in treatment emergent significant changes in fasting HDL 
cholesterol from normal (≥40 mg/dl) to low  (<40 mg/dl) (17.2%, 11/64 in the >4 mg brexpiprazole 
group; compared to 11.8%, 63/ 534 in PBO). 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to lipids were reported by 8 (0.7%) subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 
4 mg/day group and no subjects in the placebo group. One of the 8 subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 
mg/day group with TEAEs also had a change that met the Potential Clinically Relevant criteria. One 
subject (, brexpiprazole 2 mg/day) was discontinued from IMP because of a TEAE related to lipids (blood 
triglycerides increased). All of the TEAEs related to lipids were considered to be not serious in the 
opinion of the investigator.

In the long term open label trials 13 subjects (0.91%) presented TEAEs associated with lipid 
parameters, with no event leading to discontinuation. 
Emergence of Metabolic Syndrome 
The percentage of subjects who developed metabolic syndrome (meeting ≥ 3 of the following criteria at 
a visit: central obesity [measured by waist circumference, ≥ 102 cm for males and ≥ 88 cm for 
females], dyslipidemia [triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and/or HDL< 40 mg/dL for males and < 50 mg/dL for 
females cholesterol], hypertension [systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg and Diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg] , and fasting 
glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL) was similar in the brexpiprazole and placebo groups in the short-term controlled 
trials (1.0% in both groups).  
In the fixed-dose trials, the percentage of subjects with metabolic syndrome was 0.9% [9 subjects, 2 in 
0.25 mg (2.8%), 5 in 2 mg (1.3%), and 2 in 4 mg/day (0.5%) groups] in the all brexpiprazole treatment 
group and 0.5% (2 subjects) in the placebo group 
In the single blind Stabilization phase of study 331-10-232, a total of 10/384 subjects (2.6%) met 
criteria for metabolic syndrome. During the Double-blind Maintenance phase of the trial, no subjects in 
either treatment group developed metabolic syndrome (meeting 3 or more criteria at the same visit). 
In the long term open label trials, a total of 33 subjects (2.9%) met 3 or more criteria for metabolic 
syndrome at the same visit in the long-term trials. Triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL was the most frequently 
met criterion (31.9%). 
Body Weight 
A weight increase that met the PCR criterion (increase of ≥7% from baseline in body weight) was 
observed in a higher percentage of subjects treated with brexpiprazole compared with placebo, both in 
short term controlled trials (9.1% in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group vs 3.8% PBO) and in the 
Double-blind Maintenance phase of the long term controlled trial 331-10-232 (5.2% vs 1.0%). At the 
end of the Stabilization phase of study 331-10-232 a ≥ 7% increase in body weight was reported for 
25/202 subjects (12.4%).  
The incidence of PCR weight increase (increase of ≥7% from baseline in body weight) in the fixed-dose 
trials showed a trend towards dose dependency (4.4%, 7.2%, 9.1% and 8.4% in the brexpiprazole 0.25 
mg/day, 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, and in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day groups respectively, compared with 
3.3% in the placebo group and 12% in the >4 mg group in short term trials.   
In the long term open label trials, 20.7% of subjects had a weight increase that met the PCR criterion 
(increase of ≥7% from baseline in body weight). Overall, in the subjects who had a weight gain meeting 
the PCR criterion (weight gain ≥7%, 20.7% of subjects at any visit)-, weight increased over time, with 
mean weight gains of 7.0, 7.8, 9.0, 10.3, and 10.2 kg at Weeks 8, 14, 26, 38, and 52, respectively .  . 
No subjects in the short term controlled trials or in the maintenance trial 331-10-232 were discontinued 
from IMP due to a TEAE associated with weight increased) (BMI increased, obesity, waist circumference 
increased, weight gain, and weight increased.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Related to Extrapyramidal Symptoms 
Fixed dose short term controlled trials 
Table 32 :  Summary of Incidence of TEAEs Associated with EPS (Safety Sample: 
Schizophrenia  Fixed-dose Trials 331-10-230, 331-10-231, and 331-10-002) 
akathisia events: include akathisia and psychomotor hyperactivity 
parkinsonian events: includes bradikinesia, extrapiramidal disorder, hypertonia, parkinsonism, tremor 
For most akathisia events –also in the PBO group- the time of first onset was in the category “study days 
8-21” (4.45%, 2.86%, 0.92%, 0%, 2.71% in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day, 2 mg/day, 1 mg/day, 0.25 
mg/day and placebo groups respectively). The incidence of subjects taking at least 1 EPS medication 
during the trial increased with dose of brexpiprazole (2.2%, 6.7%, 8.2%, and 13.5% of subjects in the 
brexpiprazole 0.25, 1, 2, and 4 mg/day groups, respectively). The incidence in the placebo group was 
7.3%. 
Short term controlled trials 
In the pool “short term controlled trials”, the percentage of subjects who reported TEAEs associated 
with EPS was 12.0% in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group compared with 9.6% in the placebo 
group. Akathisia was the most frequently reported EPS TEAE in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group 
(5.6%), followed by tremor (2.7%), included in the category parkinsonian events. 
No subjects in any treatment group had a serious TEAE of EPS.  
Most TEAEs associated with EPS were mild or moderate in severity. Four subjects (0.2%) in the all 
brexpiprazole treatment group had TEAEs associated with EPS that were considered to be severe 
(myoclonus 0.25 mg, dose not changed, recovered/ resolved-, 2 cases psychomotor hyperactivity: 2-4 
mg, drug withdrawn, recovered/resolved-; 4 mg, drug withdrawn, recovered/ resolved- akathisia: 5 
mg±1 mg, dose not changed, not resolved) and 1 subject (0.1%) in the placebo group had 
psychomotor hyperactivity.  
Eight subjects (0.4%) in the all brexpiprazole treatment group were discontinued from IMP due to a 
TEAE associated with EPS: two subjects receiving brexpiprazole 5 mg±1 mg, 4 subjects receiving 
brexpiprazole 4 mg (2 psychomotor hyperactivity, tremor, extrapyramidal disorders), and 2 subjects 
receiving brexpiprazole 2-4 mg (tremor, psychomotor hyperactivity). Two subjects in the placebo group 
discontinued from IMP because of EPS (extrapyramidal disorder and psychomotor hyperactivity).  
In short-term controlled Trials 331-07-203, 331-10-230, and 331-10-231, a total of 88 subjects 
(10.7%) in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group took a medication for EPS during the trial, compared 
with 36 subjects (7.8%) in the placebo group.

Short term active controlled study 14644A  
In the quetiapine arm of study 14644A the frequency of patients with EPS related to TEAEs was 9.2% 
(n=14), similar to the frequency in the brexpiprazole arm (10.7%, n= 14), and higher compared to PBO 
(6.2%, n=6.2%). Akathisia was the most frequently reported EPS TEAE in the brexpiprazole group 
(6.0%, compared to 3.9% in quetiapine treated patients and 3.1% in PBO) followed by tremor (3.3%, 
compared to 4.6% in quetiapine treated patients and 6.6% in PBO). 
Short term active controlled study 331-07-203 
In the aripiprazole 15 ± 5 mg arm of study 331-07-203 the frequency of patients with EPS related to 
TEAEs was 12% (n = 6), similar to the frequency in the placebo arm (13.7%, n= 13), compared to 
24.7% (n = 23), 14.4% (n = 13),15.7% (n = 14) and 7.1% (n=3) in the brexpiprazole groups 5.0 ± 
1mg, 2.5 ± 0.5 mg, 1.0 ± 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg respectively. Akathisia was reported as EPS TEAE in the 
brexpiprazole groups (2.4% in the 0.25 mg dose group, 6.7% in the 1 ± 0.5 mg dose group, 5.6% in the 
2.5 ± 0.5 mg dose group, 15.1% in the 5 ± 1mg dose group compared to 4.0% in aripiprazole treated 
patients and 4.2% in PBO). 
Long-term trials 
In the double-blind maintenance phase of long-term trial 331-10-32, at least one TEAEs related to EPS 
occurred in 6.19% (6/97) and 4.81% (5/104) of subjects in the brexpiprazole and placebo treatment 
groups respectively.  
In long-term open label trials 11% (159/1426) of subjects experienced TEAE associated with EPS. In 
five of these subjects the events were serious (resulted in hospitalization) and led to discontinuation (4 
subjects) or dose reduction (1 subject). In the long-term open label trials there were two events of 
tardive dyskinesia.   The incidence of EPS-related TEAE in the long-term, open-label trials by prior 
treatment in the parental trial showed a higher frequency in the prior placebo (12.6%) and de novo 
groups (14.5%), compared with the prior brexpiprazole group (9.1%). 
All Clinical Pharmacology Trials Group 
Treatment-emergent AEs associated with EPS leading to discontinuation of IMP (PTs: akathisia, 
dystonia, and extrapyramidal disorder) were reported for a total of 10 subjects in the Clinical 
Pharmacology Trials group in the brexpiprazole-treated subjects (n = 877) as follows: extrapyramidal 
disorder (5/877 subjects [0.6%], including 3 subjects with schizophrenia and 2 subjects with MDD), 
akathisia (4/877 subjects [0.5%], including 2 healthy subjects and 2 subjects with schizophrenia), and 
dystonia (1/877 subjects [0.1%], 1 subject with schizophrenia). There were no EPS-related events in 
placebo-treated subjects (n = 105). 
One EPS-related event (extrapyramidal syndrome) considered serious, severe in intensity, possibly 
related to the study medication and leading to discontinuation of IMP occurred in one MDD subject 8 
days after randomization to brexpiprazole 4 mg. The subject had no reported medical history. 
Concomitant medication taken at the time of the event included escitalopram oxalate and propanolol. 
Analyses of Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale Evaluations  
Changes from Baseline in EPS Evaluations  
In short term controlled trials, the mean scores at baseline for the SAS, BARS, and AIMS were similar 
across groups. For all 3 evaluations, the mean changes from baseline to last visit were small and similar 
in the all brexpiprazole and placebo groups. Similar results were seen for analyses using the fixed-dose 
trials; no meaningful differences were seen among the 4 dose groups of brexpiprazole.

In the Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232, symptoms of akathisia, involuntary movement, or 
tremor at baseline were very infrequent in both treatment groups based on mean baseline scores for the 
SAS, BARS, and AIMS evaluations (all mean scores ≤ 0.5). 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
For all 3 EPS scale evaluations, the mean change from baseline was small and there was minimal 
variation during the course of the long-term trials.  
Treatment-emergent Shifts in EPS Evaluation Scores  
In short term controlled trials, treatment-emergent akathisia, based on on-treatment shifts from 
baseline in BARS Global Score from ≤ 2 to > 2, was observed in 1.3% (16 subjects) and 1.1% (8 
subjects) of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day and placebo groups, respectively. 
Treatment-emergent Parkinsonism, based on on-treatment shifts from baseline in SAS Total Score from 
≤ 3 to > 3, was observed in 7.1% (68 subjects) and 4.8% (29 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 
mg/day and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment emergent shifts from baseline in AIMS Total Score 
from ≤1 to ≥2, were observed in 47/1188 subjects (4.0%) in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg and 36/728 (4.9%) 
in placebo group. 
Available data from fixed dose trials showed a trend towards a higher frequency of PCR shifts in BARS 
with higher brexpiprazole doses (0.9%, 0.8%  and 2.1% in the 1 mg group, 2 mg group and 4 mg group 
respectively, compared with 1.0% in the placebo group), SAS (5.9%, 5.9% and 7.8% in the 1 mg, 2 mg 
and 4 mg groups, respectively compared with 5.3% with PBO) , or AIMS (2.6%,  3.8%  and 4.0% in the 
1 mg group, 2 mg group, and 4 mg group, respectively, compared with 4.6% with PBO). 
Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
The mean changes from baseline to last visit were small (< 0.2) for all of the EPS evaluation scales, and 
similar between the brexpiprazole and placebo groups. Treatment-emergent akathisia, based on 
on-treatment shifts from baseline in BARS Global Score from ≤ 2 to > 2, was observed in 1 subject each 
(1.0%) in the brexpiprazole (1/96) and placebo group (1/104). No brexpiprazole-treated subjects with 
on-treatment shifts from baseline in BARS Global Score had a serious TEAE or discontinued because of 
a TEAE of akathisia. 
Treatment-emergent Parkinsonism, based on on-treatment shifts from baseline in SAS Total Score from 
≤ 3 to > 3, was observed in 2/96 (2.1%) and 4/104 (3.9%) subjects in the brexpiprazole and placebo 
groups, respectively. Of the subjects with shifts, parkinsonism was not a serious TEAE nor did it lead to 
discontinuation of IMP.Treatment emergent shifts from baseline in AIMS Total Score from ≤1 to ≥2, 
were observed in 6/96 subjects (6.25%) in brexpiprazole and 10/104 (9.62%) in placebo group. 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
Treatment-emergent akathisia, based on on-treatment shifts from baseline in BARS Global Score from 
≤ 2 to > 2, was observed in 28/1411 subjects (2.0%). The majority of these shifts were a 1-time 
occurrence. Akathisia led to discontinuation of IMP in four subjects with shifts. Treatment-emergent 
Parkinsonism, based on on-treatment shifts from baseline in SAS Total Score from ≤3 to > 3, was 
observed in 70/1129 subjects (6.20%). No subject with shifts had a Parkinsonism TEAE that led to 
discontinuation of IMP. Treatment emergent shifts from baseline in AIMS Total Score from ≤1 to ≥2, 
was observed in 91/1411 subjects (6.45%). 
Agranulocytosis, Neutropenia, and Leukopenia 
In short term controlled trials, a similar proportion of subjects experienced these TEAEs between 
brexpiprazole and PBO treated subjects (0.2 vs 0.4%), no such events occurred during the double blind

maintenance phase of trial 331-10-232,  and 6 subjects (0.42%) in the Long-term open label trials 
experienced TEAEs of hematopoietic/leucopenia events.  
In the brexpiprazole < 2 mg/day group, 1 subject (0.2%) had a TEAE of agranulocytosis.  The 
agranulocytosis was reported as a TEAE based on a single occurrence of a low (PCR) percentage of 
neutrophils (9.8%) on Day 22.  On Day 8, the neutrophil percentage was within the reference (45.9%).  
The dose of IMP was not changed in response to the TEAE.  On Day 30, the neutrophil percentage was 
within normal range (50.2%). 
Two (2.1%) subjects in the brexpiprazole group had PCR values for WBC (one case of decrease ≤2800 
and one case of increase >16.000), compared with 0 (0.0%) subjects in the placebo group. 
Ongoing Trials 
In ongoing blinded trials, TEAEs related to haematopoietic effects/leukopenia resulted in 
discontinuation of one subject and one was considered to be serious as of the cutoff date.  In ongoing 
double-blind, placebo-controlled MDD Trial 331-12-282, 1 subject experienced a TEAE of differential 
WBC count abnormal which led to discontinuation of IMP.  In ongoing, open-label MDD Trial 
331-10-238, 1 subject had a serious TEAE of iron deficiency anemia. 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome 
There were no subjects in the short-term, controlled trials, in any treatment group during the 
Stabilization or Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232, or in the long-term, open-label 
trials who reported a TEAE related to NMS. A search conducted in the Applicant’s safety database for 
postmarketing events of the PT ‘neuroleptic malignant syndrome’ reported with brexpiprazole 
cumulatively through 25 Jun 2017 retrieved 9 reported events of NMS in the postmarketing setting. 
Even though the limited available data do not allow to definitely conclude on the causal association with 
brexpiprazole in these specific cases (either due to little or no detail regarding time to onset, little 
information regarding concomitant medications, possible cofounders in medical history or concomitant 
medications or in some cases not clearly described events of NMS), a causal relationship is suspected 
due to the known association between NMS with administration of antipsychotics. 
Orthostatic Hypotension, Dizziness and Syncope 
In short term controlled trials, potentially clinically relevant changes in orthostatic hypotension (≥20 
mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure and ≥25 beats per minute increase in heart rate from supine 
to sitting/ standing) were observed in 1.6% in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg  treated patients compared to 
2.3% in placebo. In the Long term, Controlled Trial 331 10 232, there were no TEAEs of orthostatic 
hypotension reported in any treatment group during the Double blind Maintenance phase.  During the 
Stabilization phase a PCR value of orthostatic hypotension was reported in 4 subjects. In long term open 
label trials  15 subjects (1.1%) met PCR criteria for orthostatic hypotension. 
In short term controlled trials, TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or orthostatic hypotension occurred in 2.8% 
of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/ day group compared with 1.5% in the placebo group. Dizziness 
was the most frequently reported TEAE of this set of events in all groups. 
Two subjects had severe events that led to discontinuation of IMP: one serious event of dizziness 
(brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group) and one event of syncope (brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day group).

The incidence of PCR prolactin elevations at > 1 × ULN in the fixed-dose trials for female subjects was 
higher in the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day and 4 mg/day groups (18.5%, and 15.3%, respectively) 
compared with the 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day dose groups (12.4% and 12.1%, respectively). A total of 
20 female subjects, in the brexpiprazole 1 mg/day, 2 mg/day, and 4 mg/day dose groups, had an 
elevation > 2 × ULN. Five female subjects (2 subjects each in the 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day dose groups, 
and 1 subject in the 1 mg/day dose group) had an elevation > 3 × ULN at 1 visit only. Three female 
subjects (1 subject in the 2 mg/day dose group and 2 subjects in the 4 mg day dose group) had an 
elevation > 3 x ULN at more than one visit.  Data were similar for male subjects.  Five of 
8 brexpiprazole-treated male subjects with elevations > 3 × ULN were in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day 
group. Elevations were reported for 7 of the 8 subjects at 1 visit only and were asymptomatic. 
The frequencies of shifts from baseline with potential clinical relevance of increase for prolactin in 
patients with normal prolactin values at baseline,  as well as mean and median changes from baseline, 
showed a trend  towards a dose-dependency in females patients, in fixed dose trials (> 1 x ULN  during 
treatment in females with normal prolactin at baseline were observed in 16.4%, 15.2% and 20.4% in 
females treated with brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively, compared to 9.8% in PBO. 
Increases >2 x ULN were observed in 3.0%, 5.8% and 1.4% in females treated with brexpiprazole 1 
mg, 2 mg and 4 mg, respectively, compared to 3.8% in PBO. Increases > 3 x ULN occurred only in 
subjects treated with the higher 4 mg brexpiprazole dose (3/144, 2.1% in females, compared with 0 in 
PBO).    
In males smaller changes were observed, with smaller differences from placebo.  
From available data, frequencies of prolactin increases from baseline PCR in females patients with 
normal prolactin at baseline tended to be higher in long term uncontrolled trials compared to those 
observed in short term trials (long term uncontrolled trials: females: >1 x ULN: 24.2%,  >2 x ULN: 
3.9%,  >3 x ULN: 2.9%;  males: >1 x ULN: 17.1%,  >2 x ULN: 2.7%,  >3 x ULN: 0.5% vs short term 
controlled trials: females: >1 x ULN: 17.8%,  >2 x ULN: 2.9%,  >3 x ULN: 0.9%;  males: >1 x ULN:

The majority of subjects in the Double-blind Maintenance phase were male; 116 male and 76 female 
subjects were assessed for prolactin.   
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
Values of PCR for prolactin (> 1 × ULN) were observed in 98 female subjects (19.8%) and 87 male 
subjects (12.9%); the incidences in the short-term trials were 13.9% and 9.0%, respectively.  There 
were 19 female subjects (3.8%) and 27 male subjects (4.0%) with a value > 2 ×ULN. There were 
15 female subjects (3.0%) and 14 male subjects (2.1%) with a value > 3 × ULN.  Of these 29 subjects 
with a prolactin value > 3 × ULN, 23 met that criterion at only 1 assessment.  None of these subjects 
reported a reproductive system symptom. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Associated with Prolactin  
To assess for clinical significance, a search was conducted in subjects with a prolactin elevation 
> 1 × ULN using the following PTs:  blood prolactin increased, blood prolactin abnormal, 
hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea gynaecomastia, breast swelling, breast enlargement, breast mass, 
breast tenderness, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, anovulatory cycle, hypomenorrhea. 
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to prolactin (blood prolactin increased, blood prolactin decreased, or 
hyperprolactinemia) were reported in 22 subjects (1.3%) in the brexpiprazole-treated groups (subjects 
were in the 2 to 4 mg dose group [n = 17; 1.4%], < 2 mg dose group [n = 3; 0.7%], > 4 mg dose 
group [n = 2; 2.2%]) and 8 subjects (1.1%) in the placebo group.  All of these TEAEs were considered 
mild or moderate in severity by the investigator.  The dose of IMP was not changed for any of these 
subjects due to the increase in prolactin.  Five of these subjects had a prolactin level > 3 × ULN. In the 
fixed-dose trials, blood prolactin increased was observed in 10 subjects (2.1%) in the brexpiprazole 
4 mg/day group, 6 subjects (1.2%) in the brexpiprazole 2 mg/day group, 3 subjects (1.3%), in the 
brexpiprazole 1 mg/day group, 7 subjects (1.4%) in the placebo group, and by no subjects in the 
brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group.  Hyperprolactinemia was reported in 2 subjects each in the 
brexpiprazole 1 mg/day (0.9%), brexpiprazole 2 mg/day (0.4%), and placebo groups (0.4%), and by 
1 subject (0.2%) in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day group.  No subjects reported hyperprolactinemia in the 
brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group. 
A search of the clinical database for TEAEs in the SOCs of Reproductive System and Breast Disorders 
and Psychiatric Disorders (sexual function-related AEs; eg, decreased libido, anorgasmia) for the 22 
subjects with TEAEs related to prolactin revealed that they had none of these types of TEAEs in these 
SOCs. 
In short term controlled trials among subjects with potentially clinically relevant changes (PCR) in 
prolactin (> 1 × ULN), one patients each in brexpiprazole and PBO group experienced dysmenorrea and 
no subjects experienced sexual function related TEAEs.

Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
No TEAE meeting the criteria for prolactin have been reported in Trial 331-10-232. 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to prolactin (blood prolactin increased, blood prolactin abnormal, 
hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhea gynaecomastia, breast swelling, breast enlargement, breast mass, 
breast tenderness, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, anovulatory cycle, hypomenorrhea) were reported in 
23 subjects (1.6%); 7 male subjects (3 with blood prolactin increased and 4 with hyperprolactinemia) 
and 16 female subjects (11 with blood prolactin increased and 5 with hyperprolactinemia).  The dose 
was reduced in 4 female subjects due to the increase in prolactin, but no subject was discontinued due 
to the increase.  Two of these 23 subjects had an elevation of > 3 × ULN.  A search of the clinical 
database for TEAEs in the SOCs of Reproductive System and Breast Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders 
(sexual function-related AEs; eg, decreased libido, anorgasmia) for the 23 subjects with TEAEs related 
to prolactin revealed none had these types of TEAEs in these SOCs. 
In long term trials among subjects with potentially clinically relevant changes (PCR) in prolactin (> 1 × 
ULN) one patient presented a TEAE of menstruation irregular and one patient presented a TEAE of libido 
decreased. The event was mild in severity and was considered possibly related to the study drug.

A total of 7 subjects (0.5%) had a TEAE related to QT prolongation. There were 8 TEAEs of ECG QT 
prolonged in 7 subjects.  All were considered related to IMP, were mild or moderate in severity, and 
were not serious TEAEs.  Two subjects were withdrawn from IMP.   
Potentially Clinically Relevant ECG Changes  
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
The most frequently reported PCR changes overall were ST/T morphological changes, including 
myocardial ischemia, symmetrical T-wave inversions, and increases in QTcF  450 msec, which were 
reported in a comparable proportion of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day, all brexpiprazole, 
and placebo groups.  In short-term, Controlled Trials, increases in QTcF  450 msec occurred in 9/439 
(2.1%), 28/1156 (2.4%), 4/91 (4.4%) and 20/699 (2.9%) subjects, in subjects receiving 
brexpiprazole <2 mg, 2-4 mg, >4 mg and placebo respectively. 
In fixed dose trials, increases in QTcF  450 msec were observed in 2/85 (2.4%), 6/226 (2.7%), 11/466 
(2.4%)  and 8/453 (1.8%) and 10/452 (2.2%) subjects, in subjects receiving brexpiprazole 0.25 mg, 1 
mg, 2 mg, 4 mg and placebo respectively.

(Double-blind Maintenance Phase, Safety Sample) 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
The most commonly reported PCR changes overall were ST/T morphology abnormalities: myocardial 
ischemia in 18 (1.3%) subjects, symmetrical T-wave inversions in 58 (4.2%) subjects, and increase in 
QTcF ≥ 450 msec in 66 (4.8%) subjects.  In addition, the heart rhythm disorders sinus bradycardia, 
supraventricular premature beat, and ventricular premature beat were reported by 34 (3.1%), 39 
(2.8%), and 26 (1.9%) subjects, respectively.  
All Clinical Pharmacology Trials Group 
There were 2 events of potential interest related to ECG or cardiac abnormalities in clinical 
pharmacology trials; both led to discontinuation of IMP.  An elderly subject with MDD (Subject, treated 
with brexpiprazole) was discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged that 
was assessed as related to IMP.  A healthy subject (Subject, treated with brexpiprazole) was 
discontinued from IMP due to TEAEs of chest discomfort and chest pain; the cardiac assessments 
(enzymes, ECGs) were negative, the etiology was undetermined, and both events were assessed as 
unlikely related to the IMP.   
Ongoing Trials 
In ongoing, double-blind agitation associated with dementia of Alzheimer’s type Trial 331-12-283, two 
–still blinded- subjects were discontinued from IMP due to nonserious TEAEs of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged. 
In ongoing, open-label MDD Trial 331-10-238, 3 events of electrocardiogram QT prolonged have been 
reported that resulted in discontinuation from the trial, 1 of which was a serious TEAE.

Change from Baseline - Electrocardiogram Results 
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
Mean baseline ECG parameters were similar among treatment groups.  Mean changes from baseline at 
last visit were small in magnitude and similar across groups.  For QTcF, there was a small increase in the 
brexpiprazole < 2 mg, brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg, all brexpiprazole, and placebo groups (1.78, 1.18, 
1.18, and 2.10 msec, respectively).  None of the changes observed in the ECG parameters were 
considered to be clinically relevant.

Long-term, Open-label Trials 
Similar to short-term and long-term controlled trials for the brexpiprazole group during double-blind 
treatment, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline at last visit in any ECG parameter 
in the long-term, open-label trials.  
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation and Rhabdomyolysis  
The evaluation of CPK elevation and rhabdomyolysis included a review of TEAEs as well as an 
assessment of change from baseline and PCR values for CPK.  The TEAEs that were included in the 
search for rhabdomyolysis and CPK elevation were based on the SMQ for rhabdomyolysis.  
In short term controlled trials, in the all brexpiprazole treatment group, 7.7% of subjects had a PCR CPK 
value (≥3 x ULN), compared with 5.5% in the placebo group. A CPK value ≥ 5 × ULN was reported in 
3.7% of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group compared with 2.8% in the placebo group.  
A CPK value ≥ 7 × ULN was reported in 1.7% of the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group and 4.3% of the

brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day group compared with 1.9% of the placebo group. A CPK value ≥ 10 ×ULN 
was reported in 1.0% of the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group compared with 1.1% of the placebo 
group. There was no correlation observed between the length of time IMP was taken and the elevation 
of CPK.  Most elevations of CPK to over 1000 U/L were transient and limited to 1 time point. 
During the Double blind Maintenance phase of trial 331-10-232, the incidence of PCR changes in CPK (≥ 
3 × ULN) was lower in the brexpiprazole group (1 subject [1.1%]) compared with the placebo group (4 
subjects [4.0%])  
In the long-term, open-label trials, a total of 109 subjects (8.1%) had PCR CPK test results (≥ 3 × ULN); 
among these, 44 subjects (3.1%) had a PCR CPK value ≥ 5 × ULN, 27 subjects (1.9%) had a PCR CPK 
≥ 7 × ULN, and 12 subjects (0.8%) had a PCR CPK ≥ 10 × ULN. 
Rhabdomyolysis was reported as a TEAE in 3 brexpiprazole treated subjects in the short-term 
schizophrenia trials (2 in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group, 1 in the brexpiprazole < 2 mg/day 
group). All 3 events in were serious TEAEs and 2 led to discontinuation of IMP. This TEAE was considered 
to be severe in 2 subjects in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group and mild in 1 subject in the 
brexpiprazole < 2 mg/day group. A further event of rhabdomyolysis occurred in the aripiprazole group.  
In the aripiprazole group; the subject had a severe event that was a serious TEAE and resulted in 
discontinuation of IMP. Further examination of the subjects in the brexpiprazole groups with 
rhabdomyolysis reported during the short-term trials showed that none were symptomatic (eg, all were 
afebrile; HR and BP were stable, no urine blood, and no muscle complaints).  At least one event of 
rhabdomyolysis possibly related to brexpiprazole occurred in brexpiprazole CDP and at least one further 
event for which a causal relationship with brexpiprazole may not be excluded occurred in the 
post-marketing setting. In the short term controlled trials, increased blood CPK was reported as a TEAE 
in 9 subjects (2.0%), 26 subjects (2.2%), 5 subjects (5.4%), and 8 subjects (1.1%) in the 
brexpiprazole < 2 mg/day, 2 to 4 mg/day, > 4 mg/day groups, and placebo group, respectively.  There 
was 1 report of blood CPK increased as a serious TEAE, and 2 reports of blood CPK increased leading to 
discontinuation of IMP.   
There were no TEAEs of rhabdomyolysis reported during the Stabilization and Double blind Maintenance 
phases of Trial 331 10 232.  There were also no TEAEs associated with CPK elevations in the 
Investigations SOC in Double-blind Maintenance phase.  In the Stabilization phase there were 6 (1.3%) 
subjects with a TEAE of blood CPK increased. 
There were no reports of rhabdomyolysis or related events in the long-term schizophrenia trials.  A total 
of 26 subjects (1.8%) were reported to have blood CPK increased.  None were serious TEAEs, 1 was 
severe, and 2 resulted in discontinuation of IMP.  All except 3 events resolved or were resolving.  Of the 
26 subjects, 7 subjects had a TEAE that was assessed as related.  Onset of CPK elevation in these events 
varied from -14 to 383 days. 
Seizures  
In short term controlled trial, seizures related TEAEs were reported in two subjects each in the 2-4 mg 
brexpiprazole dose group (0.16%) and in placebo group (0.27%).  
Patient (from study 14644A), had a severe grand mal convulsion (a single seizure) 4 days after the first 
dose of IMP. was hospitalised and was stable the next day. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no 
signs of active paroxysmal activity and neurological examination showed no focal symptoms. had no 
relevant medical history but had two episodes of nonserious agitation 4 days and 1 day prior to the 
convulsion. The patient recovered but was withdrawn from the study due to the event. 
In long term controlled trial 331-10-232 one event of convulsion was reported in a subject treated with 
brexpiprazole 4 mg. Two events of seizures (one serious) occurred in long term, open label trials, both 
leading to withdrawal.

Somnolence  
The TEAEs that were included in the search for somnolence (no SMQ exists) were the following:  
hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence. 
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
A TEAE related to somnolence was reported by 54 subjects (4.5%) in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day 
group compared with 28 (3.8%) subjects in the placebo group. There were no serious TEAEs related to 
somnolence and no subject discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE related to somnolence. With the 
exception of severe sedation in Subject (brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group), all TEAEs related to 
somnolence were mild or moderate in severity. Almost all events related to somnolence resolved. In 
Fixed dose trials, the incidence of somnolence events was higher in the 4 mg/day brexpiprazole group 
(4.6%), compared to lower doses (1.1%, 2.6%, and 3.1% in the brexpiprazole 0.25, 1, and 2 mg/day 
groups). The incidence in the placebo group was 2.9%. 
Study 14644A 
In study 14644A, somnolence related TEAEs were reported in 40/153 patients (26.1%) in patients 
treated with quetiapine, compared to 11/ 150 (7.3%) in brexpiprazole treated subjects and 12/ 161 
(7.5%) in Placebo.  
Study 331-07-203 
In the brexpiprazole groups, somnolence was reported as follows: 0/42 subjects (0.25 mg/day, 0.0%); 
3/89 subjects (1.0 ± 0.5 mg/day, 3.4%); 3/90 subjects (2.5 ± 0.5 mg/day, 3.3%); and 5/93 subjects 
(5.0 ± 1.0 mg/day, 5.4%). Somnolence was reported in 2/95 placebo subjects (2.1%) and 0/50 
aripiprazole subjects (0.0%). 
In the brexpiprazole groups, sedation was reported as follows: 2/42 subjects (0.25 mg/day, 4.8%); 
1/89 subjects (1.0 ± 0.5 mg/day, 1.1%); 3/90 subjects (2.5 ± 0.5 mg/day, 3.3%); and 4/93 subjects 
(5.0 ± 1.0 mg/day, 4.3%). Sedation was reported in 0/95 placebo subjects (0%) and 2/50 aripiprazole 
subjects (4.0%). 
Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
There were no reports of somnolence, hypersomnia, or sedation within the Nervous System Disorders 
SOC in any treatment group during the Double-blind Maintenance phase of the trial. 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
A TEAE related to somnolence was reported by 60 subjects (4.2%) in the long-term open-label trials; 45 
subjects (3.2%) had somnolence, 13 subjects (0.9%) had sedation and 2 subjects (0.1%) had 
hypersomnia.  One subject was discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE related to somnolence.  There was 
1 serious TEAE related to somnolence; Subject experienced moderate somnolence that was considered 
to be not related to IMP, and which resulted in hospitalization.  The dose of IMP was not changed and the 
event resolved.  Of the 45 subjects, 1 subject reported somnolence/drowsiness that was assessed as 
severe. 
Suicidality 
In short-term, controlled Trials, TEAEs related to suicidality were reported by 8 subjects (0.5%) in 
the all brexpiprazole treatment group and 3 subjects (0.4%) in the placebo group. The only two serious 
events related to suicidality (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) both occurred among brexpiprazole 
treated subjects and were considered related to IMP by the investigator; in one event (suicide attempt 
5 days after the first dose of IMP, Patient from study 14644A,) the drug was withdrawn and the event

resolved. PANSS total score was 87 at the Screening Visit and increased during the study; the last 
available measure was a PANSS total score of 105 at Visit 3. The patient had a score of 2 on the actual 
suicide attempts (based on the C-SSRS assessment at the Screening Visit) and the C-SSRS scores were 
not improved.  Seven of the 8 events occurred in fixed dose trials, with no evidence of dose dependency, 
even though the limited number of events do not allow to draw any firm conclusion. 
Analyses of the C-SSRS indicated that 3 brexpiprazole treated subjects had treatment-emergent 
suicidal behavior during the short-term trials, compared to one subject in placebo.  
Treatment-emergent suicidal ideation was assessed in a similar percentage of the all brexpiprazole (53 
subjects, 3.0%) and placebo (26 subjects, 3.5%) groups.   
Long term controlled trial 331-10-232: During the Stabilization Phase there was no 
treatment-emergent suicidal behavior as measured by elements in the C-SSRS.  The emergence of 
suicidal ideation was reported in 23/464 (5.0%) subjects, and the emergence of serious suicidal 
ideation was reported in 3/464 (0.6%) subjects according to the C-SSRS. 
The incidence of TEAEs associated with suicidality was lower in the brexpiprazole group compared with 
the placebo group during the Double blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331 10 232.  Two subjects (1.9%) 
in the placebo group experienced suicidal ideation during the Double-blind Maintenance phase of the 
trial; there were no reports of TEAEs associated with suicidality in the brexpiprazole group. 
Analysis of the C-SSRS indicated that 1 (1.0%) subject in the brexpiprazole group had 
treatment-emergent suicidal ideation compared with 4 (3.8%) subjects in the placebo group during the 
Double blind Maintenance phase of the trial.  No subjects in either treatment group had 
treatment-emergent suicidal behavior or serious suicidal ideation based on the C-SSRS.  One subject 
(1.0%) in the brexpiprazole group had treatment emergent worsening of suicidal ideation during the 
Maintenance phase. 
In long-term, Open-label Trials, TEAEs related to suicidality were reported for 23 subjects (1.6%).  
Suicidal ideation was reported in 16 subjects (1.1%); self injurious behavior in 3 subjects (0.2%); 
suicide attempt and intentional self-injury in 2 subjects each (0.1%); and intentional overdose and 
completed suicide in 1 subject each (0.1%).  Five subjects had a TEAE related to suicidality that was 
assessed as severe. Per the C-SSRS, a total of 4 subjects (0.3%) had treatment-emergent suicidal 
behavior.  Assessing the highest level of suicidal behavior, there were 3 subjects with actual attempts 
and 1 subject with aborted attempt. 
Ongoing Trials 
In the ongoing, open-label MDD Trial 331-10-238, 8 subjects were discontinued from IMP due to 
somnolence. 
There were two reports of TEAEs related to VTEs in the short-term, controlled trials.  Subject  (Trial 
331-10-002, brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group) was discontinued from IMP on Day 2, and experienced 
deep vein thrombosis on Day 15 and pulmonary embolism on Day 17.  Both events were considered to 
be not serious, related to IMP, and resolved.  The pulmonary embolism was rated as severe in intensity.  
No action was taken with IMP for either event. 
Venous Thromboembolytic Events 
Short-term, Controlled Trials  
There were two reports of TEAEs related to VTEs in the short-term, controlled trials.  Subject  (Trial 
331-10-002, brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group) was discontinued from IMP on Day 2, and experienced 
deep vein thrombosis on Day 15 and pulmonary embolism on Day 17.  Both events were considered to

be not serious, related to IMP, and resolved.  The pulmonary embolism was rated as severe in intensity.  
No action was taken with IMP for either event. 
There were no events of VTE reported in Long-term controlled Trial 331-10-232 and in long-term, 
open-label trials. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths in the brexpiprazole CDP  
In controlled schizophrenia clinical trials, no deaths occurred in the PBO arm, compared with three 
deaths  (0.1%) in brexpiprazole arms (one found dead 12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole 
trial, cause of death unkown, considered unlikely related to IMP by the investigator; one: death due to 
12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole trial, considered not related to IMP by the investigator; 
one: death due to in the single blind stabilization phase of the long term trial, considered not related to 
IMP by the investigator). Other 6 deaths occurred in schizophrenia open-label trials (gastric ulcer 
perforation/peritonitis , with no confounding factors, treated with brexpiprazole 2 mg, septic shock, 
cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, completed suicide, uterine cancer), all considered not drug 
related by the investigators. 
In MDD trials no deaths occurred during the controlled treatment period, while 7 subjects died during 
the long term open label brexpiprazole trials (2 cases of completed suicide; one case each of: metastatic 
malignant melanoma, pulmonary embolism, gastric ulcer perforation/peritonitis, ovarian cancer, acute 
myocardial infarction/ myocardial rupture), all considered not drug related by the investigator, apart 
from one case of completed suicide considered possibly related. Six further cases of death (out of 548 
randomized subjects, 1%) occurred in AD subjects whosetreatment remains blinded in ongoing trials, 
(one case each of: intracranial haemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, dementia Alzheimer’s type, 
obstructive airways disorder, encephalitis and brain oedema/ vascular encephalopathy) all considered 
not related by the investigators, apart from the case of intracranial haemorrhage considered unlikely 
related to IMP by the investigator.

Serious Adverse Events in Phase 3 Fixed-Dose Trials 331-10-230, 331-10-231, and 
331-10-002 
There were 40 brexpiprazole-treated subjects in the fixed-dose trials that experienced a serious TEAE. 
At least one serious TEAE occurred in 4.4%, 4.7%, 2.9%, 2.3% and 4.5% in subjects treated with 
brexpiprazole 0.25 mg, 1mg, 2 mg, 4 mg/ day group and PBO, respectively. Most subjects (37/40 
subjects in brexpiprazole groups and 20/22 subjects in placebo group) had events in the Psychiatric 
Disorders SOC that were related to the underlying condition (ie, acute psychosis, aggression, irritability, 
psychiatric symptom, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, or suicidal ideation). Other serious TEAEs in 
subjects in the brexpiprazole groups consisted of 1 subject in the 0.25 mg/day group (subject) with 
acute myocardial infarction, which was severe, not related to IMP, and resulted in discontinuation of 
IMP, and 1 subject in the 2 mg/day group (Subject) with rhabdomyolysis, which was severe, unlikely 
related to IMP, resulted in discontinuation of IMP, and resolved.  
Serious Adverse Events in Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the Stabilization phase, serious TEAEs were reported for 7.3% of subjects, most of which were 
associated with the Psychiatric Disorders SOC (6.3%). Schizophrenia (4.7%), psychotic disorder 
(0.6%), and suicidal ideation (0.6%) were the only serious TEAEs that occurred in more than 1 subject 
during the Stabilization phase. One subject had a fatal serious TEAE   during the Stabilization phase that 
was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to brexpiprazole therapy.  
Overall, 7.0% of subjects had a serious TEAE during the Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 
331-10-232. Subjects treated with brexpiprazole had a lower incidence of serious TEAEs (3 subjects, 
3.1%) than subjects who received placebo (11 subjects, 10.6%), primarily due to the lower incidence 
in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC. Each serious TEAE in the brexpiprazole group occurred in only 1 
subject.

Table 45:  Serious TEAEs by SOC and PT for the Double-blind Maintenance Phase of Trial  
331-10-232 (Safety Sample) 
Serious Adverse Events in Long-term, Open-label Trials 
The overall incidence of serious TEAEs in the long-term, open-label trials was 13.5%. Similar to results 
seen in the short-term trials, the highest incidence of serious TEAEs in the long-term trials (11.4% of 
subjects) occurred in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC, reflective of the underlying disease. Most other 
serious TEAEs in other SOCs were experienced by only 1 subject.  
Twenty-three subjects had schizophrenia reported as serious TEAEs that were considered related to 
IMP; other serious TEAEs assessed as related to IMP were akathisia (4 serious TEAEs), psychotic 
disorder (3 serious TEAEs), and 1 serious TEAE each of anxiety, cardiac failure congestive, general 
tonic-clonic seizure, aggression, panic attack, extrapyramidal disorder, and diabetic ketoacidosis. 
Serious Adverse Events in the All Brexpiprazole Trials Group 
The overall incidence of serious TEAEs in the All Brexpiprazole Trials group was 5.8% (406/7020 
subjects). The highest incidence of serious TEAEs occurred in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC (4.2% of 
subjects), with 3.0% of subjects reporting schizophrenia. Serious TEAEs were reported in 0.4% of 
subjects in the Nervous System Disorders SOC. The percentage of subjects who reported a serious TEAE 
was 9.9% for subjects with schizophrenia (313/3170) and 2.5% for subjects with MDD (93/3672); none 
of the subjects with ADHD (0/155) or PTSD (0/23) experienced a serious TEAE. The investigator 
considered the majority (> 69%) of serious TEAEs to be not related to IMP.

All 4 subjects who reported a serious TEAE recovered from their respective events; 2 subjects continued 
in their respective trials and 2 were discontinued due to their respective serious TEAE. 
Serious Adverse Events in Ongoing Trials 
Serious TEAEs reported during ongoing trials as of the data cutoff date of 31 Aug 2016 have been cited 
among safety topics of interest, where relevant. 
Laboratory findings 
Hepatic parameters 
In short-term, Controlled Trials no relevant difference between brexpiprazole and placebo were 
observed in the percentages of subjects with PCR hepatic values. 
In Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232, a higher frequency of potentially clinically relevant 
elevations in ALT and AST of ≥ 3 × ULN [in 2 (2.2%) and 3 (3.3%)] were reported in brexpiprazole 
treated subjects compared to PBO subjects [1 (1.0%) and 0]. 
In Long-term, Open-label Trials, two (0.1%) subjects had ALT ≥10 × ULN and 3 (0.2%) subjects had 
ALT ≥5 × ULN.  Values for AST ≥10 × ULN were reported in 1 (0.1%) subject; AST ≥ 5 × ULN was 
reported in 6 (0.4%) subjects.  One subject met Hy’s Law criteria (ALT > 3 × ULN or AST > 3 × ULN and 
total bilirubin > 2 × ULN).   
The incidence of subjects who reported TEAEs related to hepatic function was similar in the 
brexpiprazole 2-4 mg and placebo group in short term controlled trials (1.8% vs 1.9%).  
Five brexpiprazole treated subjects discontinued from IMP due to TEAEs related to hepatic function 
(0.3%) (PTs: 1 drug induced liver injury, 3 hepatic enzyme increased and one aspartate 
aminotransferase increased), compared to two discontinuations in the PBO group (0.3%) (PTs: 2 liver 
function test increased).  Among the 5 brexpiprazole treated subjects, one subject had hepatic enzyme 
elevation prior to treatment with IMP, one subject had a confounding factor/ alternative explanation 
(chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis) and in one subject hepatic enzyme elevation temporally 
corresponded to CPK elevation and blood lactate dehydrogenase increased). 
In the fixed-dose short term controlled trials no clear dose-dependency was observed in the incidence 
of TEAEs for hepatic impairment (0, 0.9%, 2.1%, 1.5% and 2.5% in the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day, 1 
EMA/556923/2018

mg/day, 2 mg/day, and 4 mg/day groups, and in the placebo group), even though the limited number 
of events do not allow to draw any firm conclusions. 
In the maintenance phase of long term controlled trial 331-10-232, hepatic enzymes increased, ALT 
increased, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were each reported for 1 (1.0%) subject in the 
brexpiprazole group; there were no TEAEs associated with hepatic function reported in the placebo 
group.  The subject with non alcoholic steatohepatitis discontinued brexpiprazole treatment due to the 
event, which was considered unrelated to IMP. The event of hepatic enzymes increased was reported as 
serious but was assessed as not related to IMP and did not lead to discontinuation. 
The incidence of subjects who reported ≥ 1 TEAE related to hepatic function in the long term, open-label 
trials was 2.4%, slightly higher than the incidence in the all brexpiprazole treatment group in the short 
term, controlled trials (1.4%).   
A TEAE related to hepatic function was reported in 34 subjects, among whom 8 were discontinued (liver 
disorder, ALT increased, hypertransaminasemia, hyperbilirubinemia, ALT increased, AST increased, and 
blood bilirubin increased and hepatic function abnormal.  The most frequently reported TEAE was ALT 
increased, which was reported for 10 (0.7%) subjects.   
One subject in the open label trial 14644B, experienced the serious TEAEs of ALT increased, AST 
increased, and blood bilirubin increased on Day 151.  That day, the subject met the PCR criteria for 
alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and AST.  The events were considered by the investigator to be not related, 
severe in intensity, and not resolved.  IMP was discontinued. 
Ongoing Trials 
Discontinuation of IMP due to a TEAE of ALT increased was reported for 3 subjects in the ongoing, 
open-label MDD Trial 331-10-238. 
Discontinuation of IMP due to TEAEs of AST increased and GGT increased were reported for at least 1 
subject each in ongoing, long-term, open-label MDD Trial 331-10-238. Discontinuation of IMP due to 
the nonserious TEAE of hepatic enzyme increased was reported for 1 subject in the ongoing agitation in 
AD Trial 331-12-284. 
Changes in Creatine Phosphokinase, Glucose, Lipids, Prolactin, White blood cells 
See dedicated sections among safety topics of special interest 
Other laboratory findings 
Mean changes from baseline to last visit, incidence of PCR values, and associated TEAEs reported for all 
hepatic and renal parameters, electrolytes, hematology and coagulation factors, urinalysis parameters, 
and adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and thyroid stimulating hormone were similar among 
treatment groups in all trials and not clinically meaningful. 
Vital Signs Parameters 
Mean changes from baseline to last visit for vital signs (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic 
blood pressure) were small, similar in brexpiprazole treatment group compared with placebo group in 
controlled trials and not considered clinically meaningful.  
Orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and syncope are discussed as safety topics of interest.  
The percentages of subjects with PCR changes in other vital signs were similar in brexpiprazole 
treatment group compared with placebo group in controlled trials.

Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
After single-dose administration of brexpiprazole to elderly ( 65 years) and adult (18 to 45 years) 
subjects in a clinical pharmacology trial, brexpiprazole exposure (maximum plasma concentration 
[Cmax] and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity [AUC]) was similar in 
both age groups.  Based on the results of the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis, age was 
identified as a statistically significant covariate on apparent central volume of distribution (Vc/F); the 
effect of age on Vc/F within the 5th and 95th percentiles of the population was -19% to 14%, and not 
considered clinically relevant. 
Table 5: Summary of Demographic Characteristics (Randomized Sample: Short-term, 
Controlled Trials - Schizophrenia) 
The use of brexpiprazole in elderly patients with schizophrenia was not systematically investigated in a 
dedicated trial.  
A dedicated 26-week, open label trial (Trial 16160A) enrolled 132 elderly patients (mean age of the 
patients was 71 years; 26% were ≥75 years), with the primary objective to evaluate the long-term 
safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole (1 to 3 mg/day) as adjunct treatment to anti depressive 
treatment in elderly patients with MDD. The mean modal and mean doses of brexpiprazole were 1.91 
mg/day and 1.80 mg/day, respectively.  
Approximately 77% of the patients had one or more TEAEs. The TEAEs with the highest incidences were 
fatigue (15%), restlessness (13%) and increased appetite (10%) followed by akathisia, weight 
increased, anxiety and dizziness (all approximately 8%). The overall incidence of patients with severe 
TEAEs was 8%. A total of 6 patients (4.5%) had 11 SAEs; 2 patients had in total 5 SAEs that were 
considered related to brexpiprazole by the investigator: One patient had hypotension and worsening of 
depression and the other patient had fall, facial bones fracture, and eye contusion. A total of 25 patients 
(19%) were withdrawn from the study due to TEAEs. The most common TEAE leading to withdrawal was 
fatigue (3.0% of patients). The proportion of patients with EPS-related TEAEs was 16% (21 patients); 
the 21 patients had 30 events; most patients had akathisia (11 patients) and tremor (9 patients). An 
increase in mean prolactin level was seen during the study, predominantly in women; 16% of patients 
had PCS high plasma level for prolactin. There were no consistent clinically relevant findings seen with 
other laboratory parameters during the study (including fasting glucose and lipid values), vital signs, 
weight, or ECG parameter values. A mean increase in weight (0.9kg) was noted from baseline to Week 
26 for those with a Week 26 assessment; a mean increase of 0.8kg from baseline to last assessment 
was noted. Among patients with post baseline assessment of metabolic syndrome, a total of 18 out of 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 137/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
89 patients fulfilled criteria for metabolic syndrome at last visit; however, 8 of them fulfilled the criteria 
already at baseline. 5 patients met criteria at baseline, but not at the last visit, and 66 patients had 
unchanged status, all suggesting no consistent shift following long-term exposure to brexpiprazole. 
Only a minimal change on the MMSE was seen; the mean score changed from 28.7 to 28.5 during the 
study. 
Pregnancy 
Neonates whose mothers are exposed to antipsychotic drugs, like brexpiprazole, during the third 
trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms. 
No adequate or well controlled trials with brexpiprazole have been conducted in pregnant women. No 
confirmed pregnancies were reported during the short-term schizophrenia trials. Six pregnancies were 
reported in the long-term trials: 2 in the controlled trial and 4 in the open-label trials. Five of the 6 
subjects were exposed to brexpiprazole. As of the data cutoff date (31 Aug 2016), follow-up information 
was available for 3 of the 6 pregnancies. There was one spontaneous abortion (subject randomized to 
placebo), 1 elective abortion, and 2 live births of normal infants with no complications reported during 
either delivery. Of the 2 remaining pregnancies, one subject was lost to follow-up and no further 
information was as yet available for the other subject. 
Adverse Events by Metabolizer Status 
In fixed-dose schizophrenia trials there were only 16 subjects CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. 
A comparison of the TEAEs from the 3 phase 3, fixed-dose schizophrenia trials showed that the 
incidence of subjects who received brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day who reported  1 TEAE was 62.5% in 
CYP2D6 PM (10 of 16) and 60.5% in CYP2D6 EM (150 of 248).  When evaluating individual TEAEs, there 
were no events that seemed to be predominantly or exclusively reported in PM subjects. The 
interpretation of this finding should be made with consideration for the small number of PM subjects 
overall (n = 16). 
Although no clinically meaningful differences were observed with respect to the intrinsic factor of 
CYP2D6 metabolizer status (poor versus extensive), a dose adjustment to one-half the maintenance 
dose is recommended in subjects with known CYP2D6 PM status to account for higher expected 
concentrations (up to 2-fold) in these subjects. 
Adverse Events for Subjects with Hepatic Impairment 
Short term controlled Phase 2-3 studies excluded patients with hepatic impairment (exclusion criteria: 
AST or ALT ≥2 x ULN), thus brexpiprazole safety in schizophrenic subjects with hepatic impairment has 
not been evaluated 
The only information on subjects with hepatic impairment come from the few subjects enrolled in the 
Phase 1 Trial 331-09-225, receiving a single 2 mg oral dose of brexpiprazole (see PK section).  
In Trial 331-09-225, subjects (n=22) with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification as mild, 
moderate, and severe) were administered an open-label dose of 2 mg brexpiprazole and followed for 8 
days with the objective of evaluating PK. The incidence of subjects reporting ≥ 1 TEAE was 31.8% in 
subjects with hepatic impairment and 26.1% in subjects with normal hepatic function. For patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score ≥ 7), the maximum recommended dosage is 
3 mg once daily for patients with schizophrenia. 
Adverse Events for Subjects with Renal Impairment 
Short term controlled Phase 2-3 studies excluded patients with renal impairment (exclusion criteria: 
creatinine ≥2 mg/dL in all studies, apart from study 14644A: serum creatinine value >1.5 upper limit of 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 138/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the reference range), thus brexpiprazole safety in schizophrenic subjects with renal impairment has not 
been evaluated. 
The only information on subjects with Renal Impairment come from the few subjects enrolled in the 
Phase 1 Trial 331-09-226 receiving a single dose of 3 mg brexpiprazole. In Trial 331-09-226, subjects 
(n=10) with severe renal impairment were administered an open-label dose of 3 mg brexpiprazole and 
followed for 8 days with the objective of evaluating PK. Pharmacokinetic results showed modest 
increases (68%) in brexpiprazole exposure while no effect on brexpiprazole Cmax was observed in 
subjects with severe renal impairment. Somnolence was reported in 3/10 subjects (30%) with renal 
impairment and orthostatic hypotension was reported by 2/10 subjects (20%) with renal impairment 
(one event severe), while no such event occurred in normal subjects (n=9). Subject in the renally 
impaired group had a TEAE of orthostatic hypotension on Day 1 at 5 hours postdose that was assessed 
as severe and related to IMP. 
For patients with moderate, severe or end-stage renal impairment (creatinine clearance CLcr < 60 
mL/minute), the maximum recommended dosage is 3 mg once daily for patients with schizophrenia. 
Adverse Events by Gender 
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
In short term controlled trials, among brexpiprazole treated patients 59% (1041/1748) of subjects 
were males. Among placebo treated subjects 57% (429/740) were males.  
In the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 61.9% 
for male subjects and 58.9% for female subjects. 
The incidence between genders was similar for the most frequently reported TEAEs (TEAEs reported by 
≥ 5% of subjects), apart from vomiting which occurred among female brexpiprazole treated subjects in 
5.3%, 4.6% and 6.4% compared to 0, 1.4% and 1.1% in males in >4mg, 2-4 mg and <2 mg groups 
respectively; no difference between genders was observed in the frequency of vomiting among placebo 
treated subjects (2.6% vs 3.0%).  
Nausea occurred more frequently among female brexpiprazole treated subjects in 4.8%, 4.8% and 
10.5% compared to 1.1%, 2.8% and 3.6%  in males in <2mg, 2-4 mg and >4 mg groups respectively; 
no difference between genders was observed in the frequency of nausea among placebo treated 
subjects (2.2% vs 3.1%).  
Similarly headache occurred more frequently among female brexpiprazole treated subjects in 12.3%, 
10% and 10.5% compared to 6.3%, 8.8% and 5.5%  in males in <2mg, 2-4 mg and >4 mg groups 
respectively; the frequency of headache among placebo treated subjects was 10.5% in males vs 7.4% 
in females.  
Based on the results of the population PK analysis, female subjects were predicted to have 22% smaller 
apparent Vc/F and 20% lower apparent clearance compared with male subjects, leading to 25% higher 
brexpiprazole area under the concentration-time curve during the dosing interval at steady state 
(AUC). 
Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the brexpiprazole group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 48.3% for male 
subjects and 35.9% for female subjects. The incidence between genders was higher in males for 
headaches (8.6% vs 2.6%) and insomnia (8.6% vs 0); whereas it was similar for the other most 
frequently reported TEAEs (TEAEs reported by ≥ 5% of subjects). The higher frequency in males for 
headache was observed also in PBO treated subjects (14.1% vs 2.5%), while insomnia among PBO 
treated patients occurred more frequently in females (males 3.1% vs females 15%).  
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 139/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
The incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 38.4% for male subjects (n = 799) and 41.8% for 
female subjects (n = 627).  For the TEAEs reported by  5% of subjects, the incidence of insomnia was 
9.1% in male subjects compared with 7.2% in female subjects.  Nasopharyngitis and headache were 
reported at a higher incidence in female subjects (8.9% and 8.5%, respectively) compared with male 
subjects (4.5% and 6.3%, respectively).  There was no clinically meaningful difference in incidence 
between the genders for other TEAEs. 
Adverse Events by Race Group 
Short-term, Controlled Trials 
In the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 51.9% 
in white subjects and 70.5% in subjects in all other races. The frequently reported TEAEs of akathisia, 
diarrhea, headache, and weight increased all occurred more often in other races than in white subjects.  
Agitation and insomnia were more frequent in white subjects than in subjects of other races.  There was 
no clinically meaningful difference in incidence between the race groups for other TEAEs. 
Of note, the population PK analysis did not identify race as a covariate in brexpiprazole PK parameters. 
Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the brexpiprazole group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 38.7% in white 
subjects and 51.4% in subjects in all other races. The commonly reported TEAEs of headache occurred 
more often in white subjects than in other races.  There was no clinically meaningful difference in 
incidence between the race groups for other TEAEs. 
Long-term, Open-label Trials 
The incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was 35.2% in white subjects (n = 754) and 45.2% in 
subjects in all other races (n = 304). For the TEAEs reported by  5% of subjects, headache was more 
frequently reported in white subjects (8.6%) compared with subjects in all other races (5.7%).  
Nasopharyngitis, akathisia, insomnia, and schizophrenia were reported more frequently in subjects of 
other races (10.9%, 7.9%, 10.4%, and 16.1%, respectively) compared with white subjects (2.5%, 
3.7%, 6.4%, and 12.6%, respectively).  There was no clinically meaningful difference in incidence 
between the race groups for the TEAE of headache.

In the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was higher 
in North America (73.4%) and Asia (71.2%) compared to Latin America (63.5%) and Europe (46.0%). 
For the most frequently reported TEAEs, headache, weight increased, and akathisia were reported more 
frequently in North America (18.4%, 10.2%, and 9.6%, respectively) when compared with other 
regions. 
Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the brexpiprazole group, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE was higher in North 
America (61.8%), compared with Latin America (50.0%), Asia (40.0%) and Europe (29.8%). For the 
most frequently reported TEAEs, headache was reported more frequently in Europe (10.6%) when 
compared with other regions.

Long-term, Open-label Trials 
For the TEAEs reported by  5% of subjects by region, Latin America reported a higher incidence of 
weight increased (when compared to Asia, Europe, and North America (13.3%, 6.3%, 9.6%, 7.7%, 
respectively).  Subjects in North America reported a lower incidence of schizophrenia when compared to 
Asia, Europe, and Latin America (8.9%, 20.7%, 13.8%, and 18.9%, respectively.  Subjects in Europe 
reported a lower incidence of akathisia when compared to Asia, North America, and Latin America 
(3.0%, 7.5%, 7.2%, and 8.9%, respectively.  Subjects in Asia reported a higher incidence of 
nasopharyngitis when compared to Europe, North America, and Latin America (19.8%, 2.3%, 2.8%, 
and 1.1%, respectively).  There was no clinically meaningful difference in incidence among regions for 
other TEAEs. 
Overdose 
In Trial 331-10-242 (QT study), 56 subjects (age range 21-55 years) in the brexpiprazole 12 mg 
treatment arm were exposed to this dose for up to 11 days. Seven subjects out of 67 (10.4%) assigned 
to the 12 mg dose group discontinued due to the following TEAEs dizziness 2 subjects (3%), 
extrapyramidal symptoms (3 subjects), joint stiffness, akathisia, psychotic disorder, 1 subject each. 
There was 1 subject () in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group with a TEAE possibly associated with 
overdose.  The event was an overdose of Nitrazepam, and occured on Day 43 after the trial was 
complete.  A TEAE of intentional self-injury (VT: self mutilation [neck abrasions]) was reported for this 
same subject.  The events were mild in severity, not related to IMP, and not serious.  No action was 
taken with IMP.  The events resolved and the subject recovered.  Subject, in the same treatment group, 
experienced a serious TEAE of suicide attempt.  The event was moderate in severity, and considered by 
the investigator to be related to IMP.  The subject discontinued from the study, and recovered from the 
event.  Intentional self-injury was reported for a patient    ( right forearm bite self inflicted) in the 
brexpiprazole < 2 mg /day group in the fixed dose Trial 331-10-230.  The TEAE was assessed as 
moderate in severity, not related to IMP, and not serious.  The dose of IMP was not changed.  The event 
resolved and the subject recovered.  One other subject in the < 2 mg/day group () experienced a TEAE 
of self injurious behavior.  The event was mild in intensity, not related to IMP, and not serious.  No 
action was taken with IMP.  The event resolved and the subject recovered. 
There were no reported overdoses (> 12 mg/day) of brexpiprazole in the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase of Trial 331-10-232, and overdoses were reported (> 12 mg/day) for 2 subjects in the long-tem, 
open-label Trial 331-10-237. 
In long-term, open-label schizophrenia trials, TEAEs of accidental overdose were reported for 6 
(0.42%) subjects.  In all 6 subjects the TEAE was rated as mild in severity and the subjects recovered.  
The dose was not changed and all subjects continued the trial.  Intentional overdose was reported for 
1 subject.  The intentional overdose TEAE was rated as severe and the subject recovered. 
Self injurious behavior was reported for 3 subjects.  The TEAE was assessed as mild or moderate in 
severity, all subjects recovered.  The dose was not changed for 2 subjects, and was withdrawn in the 
third subject. 
Suicide attempt was reported for 2 subjects.  The TEAE was assessed as moderate in severity in 1 
subject and as severe in the other subject.  Both subjects recovered and were withdrawn from the trial.   
Eight events of overdose with brexpiprazole have been reported to date from the postmarketing 
setting; none of these events was serious or resulted in any adverse outcomes.   
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No formal assessments of withdrawal have been conducted in human subjects. 
In the short-term, controlled trials, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE in the 30-day 
follow-up period was 18.0% in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group (121 of 671 subjects), and 
EMA/556923/2018

18.7% in the placebo group (83 of 445 subjects).  The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
schizophrenia (16 [2.4%] subjects in the 2-4 mg brexpiprazole treatment group and 10 [2.2%] 
subjects in the placebo group), constipation (12 [1.8%] subjects in the 2-4 mg brexpiprazole treatment 
group and 4 [0.9%] subjects in the placebo group), nasopharyngitis (9 [1.3%] subjects in the all 
brexpiprazole treatment group and 6 [1.3%] subjects in the placebo group), and headache (9 [1.3%] 
subjects in the all brexpiprazole treatment group and 4 [0.9%] subjects in the placebo group). 
In the long-term, controlled Trial 331-10-232, no subject in the brexpiprazole group experienced a 
TEAE in the 30-day follow-up period.  In the placebo group the incidence of subjects who reported  1 
TEAE in the 30-day follow-up period was 1.9% (2 of 104 subjects). 
In the long-term, open-label trials, the incidence of subjects who reported  1 TEAE in the 30-day 
follow-up period was 4.9% (53 of 1074 subjects).  The most frequently reported TEAE was 
schizophrenia (13 [1.2%] subjects) followed by back pain (3 [0.3%] subjects) and agitation 
(2 [0.2%] subjects); no other TEAE was reported in more than 1 subject.  There was no indication of a 
withdrawal syndrome attributable to brexpiprazole.

No trials have been conducted to evaluate the concomitant administration of alcohol and brexpiprazole. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations in Short-term, Controlled Trials 
The percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs leading to discontinuation of IMP was 8.8% (106 subjects) 
in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group and 13.1% (97 subjects) in the placebo group.  
AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP were predominately in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC [9.4% (43 
subjects) in the brexpiprazole <2 mg/ day group, 6.7% (80 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day 
group, 7.5% (7 subjects) in the >4 mg group and 10.5% (78 subjects) in the placebo group] and were 
likely related to the underlying condition (schizophrenia: 7,0%, 5.3%, 3.2% and 8.8%; psychotic 
disorder: 1.1%, 0.7%, 2.2% and 1.1%; agitation: 0.2%, 0.2%, 1.1% and 0.3%, hallucination: 0.2%, 
0.1%, 0 and 0 in the Brexpiprazole <2 mg, 2-4 mg, >4 mg and PBO respectively).  
Among subjects treated with aripiprazole 0/50 experienced AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP in the 
Psychiatric Disorders SOC; among subjects treated with quetiapine 4/153 (2.6%) experienced AEs 
leading to discontinuation of IMP in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC.  
Five brexpiprazole treated subjects discontinued from IMP due to TEAEs related to hepatic function 
(0.3%) (PTs: 1 drug induced liver injury in a subject treated with brexpiprazole 2 mg, 3 hepatic enzyme 
increased -2 in subjects treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg and one in a subject treated with 2 
mg/day-and one aspartate aminotransferase increased, in a subject treated with brexpiprazole 1 mg), 
compared to two discontinuations in the PBO group (0.3%) (PTs: 2 liver function test increased). 
Other TEAEs that led to discontinuation in > 1 subject in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group were 
dizziness, rhabdomyolysis (both reported by 2 subjects each, 0.2% vs 0 events in PBO) and 
psychomotor hyperactivity (4 subjects in the 2-4 mg/ day group, 0.3% compared to one subject, 0.1% 
in PBO. A further subject treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg, discontinued due to blood creatinine 
phosphokinase increased and one subject in the 2 mg group discontinued due to blood triglycerides 
increased. 
One event each of electrocardiogram QRS prolonged (2-4 mg group, 0.1%) and electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged (>4 mg group, 1%) leading to discontinuation occurred in brexpiprazole treated subjects, 
compared to one event of electrocardiogram QT prolonged in PBO (0.1%).    
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 142/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Among subjects treated with aripiprazole 3/50 subjects (6%) experienced TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation (one event each of rhabdomyolysis, alanine aminotransferase increased and complex 
partial seizure).   
Among subjects treated with quetiapine 4/153 subjects (2.6%) experienced TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation (3 events of schizophrenia and one event of anxiety). 
Discontinuations in Phase 3 Fixed-Dose Trials 331-10-230, 331-10-231, and 331-10-002 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of IMP in the fixed-dose trials was 13.3% (12/90 
subjects) in the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group, 12.8% (30/235 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 1 
mg/day group, 7.9% (38/482 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 2 mg/day group, and 10.1% (48/477 
subjects) in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day group, compared with 15.5% (75/484 subjects) in the placebo 
group.  
AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP were predominately in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC [11.1% 
(10/90 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day group, 11.9% (28/235 subjects) in the 
brexpiprazole 1 mg/day group, 6.4% (31/482 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 2 mg/day group, and 8.0% 
(38/477 subjects) in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day group, compared with 12.2% (59/484 subjects) in the 
placebo group] and were likely related to the underlying condition (pooled PTs schizophrenia, psychotic 
disorder, agitation, hallucination: 10.6%, 6.2%, 7.5% and 11.5% in the brexpiprazole  1 mg/day 
group, 2 mg/day group, 4 mg/day group and placebo group, respectively). 
Except for these psychiatric disorders TEAEs, only hepatic enzyme increase (2 subjects [4 mg]) and 
psychomotor hyperactivity (3 subjects [4 mg]) were experienced by more than 1 subject in any of the 
brexpiprazole dose groups. 
Discontinuations in Long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232 
In the single blind Stabilization phase of the long term trial 331-10-232, the most frequently occurring 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of brexpiprazole therapy were related to the subject’s underlying 
disease (schizophrenia). In the Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232, discontinuations 
of IMP due to TEAEs occurred more frequently in the PBO group (11.5%) compared with the 
brexpiprazole group (5.2%), due to a lower incidence of discontinuations due to Psychiatric Disorders 
(schizophrenia, psychotic disorder, and suicidal ideation) for subjects in the brexpiprazole group.  
Discontinuations in Long-term, Open-label Trials Group - Schizophrenia 
In the Long-term, Open-label Trials, 226 subjects (15.9%) had a TEAE leading to discontinuation. Most 
subjects who discontinued IMP because of a TEAE had events in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC (182 
subjects, 12.8%), such as schizophrenia (144 subjects, 10.1%), psychotic disorder (18 subjects, 
1.3%), insomnia (4 subjects, 0.3%), and agitation (3 subjects, 0.2%). Other events leading to 
discontinuation of more than 2 subjects in the Long-term, Open-label trials were weight increased (5 
subjects, 0.4%), akathisia (7 subjects, 0.5%), alanine aminotransferase increased (3 subjects, 0.2%), 
and pregnancy (3 subjects, 0.2%). 
Post marketing experience 
Brexpiprazole was approved for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) 
in Jul 2015.   
Based on an approximated 26130894 tablets of brexpiprazole distributed through 30 Sep 2016, the 
cumulative number of patient-years treated with marketed brexpiprazole was 71591. This estimate of 
patient exposure is based on the availability of monthly product distribution figures, and patient 
exposure estimates are based on calculations from these figures.  Due to the limitations of this 
approach, it is not possible to reliably estimate the number of subjects treated with marketed 
brexpiprazole. 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 143/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The postmarketing safety information for brexpiprazole was reviewed from 5 quarterly Periodic Adverse 
Drug Experience Reports (PADERs), covering the period from 10 Jul 2015 through 09 Oct 2016. 
Cumulatively through 30 Sep 2016, the most frequently reported ADRs for marketed brexpiprazole 
included weight increased (n = 235, of which 7 were serious), akathisia (n = 162, of which 8 were 
serious), and anxiety (n = 81, of which 5 were serious). 
Eight (8) events of overdose with brexpiprazole have been reported to date from the postmarketing 
setting; none of these events was serious or resulted in any adverse outcomes.  Thus, the information 
regarding the risk associated with an overdose of brexpiprazole remains limited. 
In total, 5 cases of NMS, 4 cases of suicide attempt, 35 cases of suicidal ideation, and 4 cases of 
completed suicide have been reported in the postmarketing setting, with very limited data provided.  A 
causal relationship could not be established in these cases due to lack of information regarding either 
indication, dose administered, treatment duration, clinical feature or course of the events. 
2.1.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The brexpiprazole clinical development program (CDP) consists of trials for monotherapy of 
schizophrenia and as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Additionally, the CDP 
contains trials for brexpiprazole for monotherapy of agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
(still blinded) and adjunctive treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
As of the data cut-off date, 3450 subjects with schizophrenia have been exposed to brexpiprazole. In 
the entire brexpiprazole CDP, 7020 subjects in phase 2/3 trials (for MDD, schizophrenia, ADHD, and 
PTSD) and 877 subjects in clinical pharmacology trials have been exposed to at least 1 dose of 
brexpiprazole in clinical trials conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. 
The clinical pharmacology trials conducted in the brexpiprazole CDP include diverse populations (male 
and female subjects, healthy subjects, subjects with psychiatric diseases [including schizophrenia, 
MDD, and ADHD], subjects with hepatic or renal impairment, and limited numbers of elderly subjects), 
different trial designs, and doses ranging from 0.2 mg/day to 12 mg/day (1 mg/day to 12 mg/day for 
schizophrenia). 
An adequate number of patients are available to assess the short-term safety of brexpiprazole in 
subjects with schizophrenia compared with placebo: 1748 patients were exposed to brexpiprazole in 
fixed dose (Phase 3 trials: 331-10-231, 331-10-230, 331-10-002) or flexible dose (Phase 3 trial 
14644A; Phase 2 Trial: 331-07-203) 6-weeks trials, compared to 740 patients randomized to placebo.  
Of these short-term 6 weeks brexpiprazole-treated patients, 1199 were treated with the recommended 
maintenance dose range requested for marketing authorization (2 mg per day to 4 mg per day). In the 
short term controlled trials only about half of the patients (56%, n=986) were exposed for 6 weeks 
(expected duration of the study). Among the most frequent reasons of discontinuation, there were AEs 
(9.4%), consent withdrawal (12.3%) and lack of efficacy (7.4%). Only two of these 6 weeks short-term 
trials included an active controlled arm: Study 14644A, a Phase 3 flexible dose study, included 153 
patients treated with quetiapine XR 400-800 mg and Study 331-07-203, a fixed-flexible dose, phase 2 
study included 50 patients treated with aripiprazole 15±5 mg.  
The three Phase 3 fixed dose short term controlled trials –that include approximately 70% (n=1284) of 
subjects of the Short Term Controlled Safety Sample- evaluated the following brexpiprazole doses: 
0.25 mg/day (n=90), 1 mg/day (n=235), 2 mg/day (n=482), and 4 mg/day (n=477). These pooled 
data by fixed dose are the only data that allow an evaluation of a dose-dependent brexpiprazole safety 
within the proposed therapeutic brexpiprazole dose, as in the overall Short Term Controlled Safety 
Sample, three integrated dose groups are presented: < 2 mg/day, 2 to 4 mg/day, and > 4 mg/day.  
The only controlled long term safety data come from the 97 brexpiprazole-treated patients within the 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 144/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232 comparing brexpiprazole with placebo (n=105), 
administered for up to 52 weeks in subjects who were previously stabilized on brexpiprazole 1 to 4 
mg/day. Thus in the interpretation of the safety data of this long-term controlled pool it must be taken 
in consideration that this is a selected patient population (only patients who tolerated brexpiprazole and 
presented the stability criteria of psychotic symptoms on brexpiprazole 1-4 mg for a consecutive period 
of 12 weeks were randomized in the maintenance period).  Approximately half of the subjects in the 
brexpiprazole group (52%, n=50) completed 24 weeks of therapy during the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase compared with 38% of subjects (n=40) in the placebo group. Few subjects (16 
brexpiprazole-treated subjects and 9 subjects in placebo group) were treated through Week 52 of the 
Double-blind Maintenance phase, due primarily to the early termination of the trial. Most patients 
(63.9%, n=62) received brexpiprazole 4 mg/ day, while 25 patients (25.8%) received brexpiprazole 3 
mg/ day.  
Most long-term safety data come from Open-label Trials in Schizophrenia, where 1426 patients 
received brexpiprazole (all doses). 846 subjects (59.3%) were exposed to ≥ 26 weeks of treatment and 
654 subjects (45.8%) were exposed to ≥ 52 weeks of treatment. The most frequent modal dose was 4 
mg/ day (46%, n = 663), followed by 2 mg/ day (31%, n = 442) and 3 mg/ day (20%, n = 279).  
Other safety data come from the US post marketing setting, as brexpiprazole has been approved for 
marketing by the US FDA in July 2015, for the following two indications: adjunctive therapy to 
antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment of schizophrenia. 
The schizophrenia patient population included in the safety database is not entirely representative of 
individuals affected by schizophrenia who are the targets of the claimed indication, as elderly subjects, 
subjects with psychiatric comorbidities, chronic medical illnesses -including cardiovascular diseases and 
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus- subjects with substance abuse, hepatic impairment and renal 
impairment have been excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, common concomitant medications 
used in schizophrenia were prohibited in the brexpiprazole schizophrenia protocols, thus data regarding 
brexpiprazole use with concomitant medication in the schizophrenia program is limited. 
In the short term controlled pool similar frequencies of any TEAEs (60.7 vs 62%), occurred in 
brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/day group and PBO treated subjects, even though TEAEs potentially related to 
IMP occurred with higher frequency in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/day group compared to PBO (55.9% vs 
33%). In fixed-dose trials a dose relationship was observed for TEAE assessed as potentially related to 
IMP (26.8%, 29.9%, 35.6%, of subjects in the brexpiprazole 1, 2, and 4 mg/day groups respectively, 
compared to 30.8% in placebo groups). Severe TEAEs (5.4% vs 6.6%) and serious TEAEs (3.1% vs 
4.2%) occurred with similar frequencies respectively in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group and PBO treated 
subjects, with no dose-relationship observed in fixed dose trials. TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
IMP occurred frequently in both treatment groups in the short term controlled pool (brexpiprazole 2-4 
mg: 8.8% vs placebo: 13.5%). In both treatment groups TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
predominantly in the psychiatric disorder SOC, likely related to the underlying condition (PTs 
schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, agitation and hallucination).   In Phase 3 short term fixed dose trials 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred with higher frequency in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/ day group 
(10.1%) compared to brexpiprazole 2 mg/ day group (7.9%); however TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation likely related to the underlying condition (PTs schizophrenia, psychotic disorders, 
agitation and hallucination) occurred with a lower frequency in the brexpiprazole 2 mg/day group 
(6.2%) and 4 mg/day group (7.5%) compared to 1 mg/ day group (10.6%) and PBO (11.5%).   
In the long term maintenance phase of study 331-10-232, a higher frequency of any TEAE, TEAEs 
potentially related to IMP, serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred in PBO arm 
compared to brexpiprazole 1-4 mg/ group. The apparently worse safety profile of the PBO arm is mainly 
due to lack of efficacy as a consequence of the study design; the incidence of TEAEs in the Psychiatric 
Disorders SOC was of 9.3% in the brexpiprazole group compared with 24.0% in the placebo group (with 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 145/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the most evident differences for the PTs schizophrenia and psychotic disorders).  
A higher frequency of serious TEAEs (13.5%) and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of IMP (15.8%) 
occurred in long term open label trials, compared to short term controlled trials. This may at least in 
part be a consequence of the longer exposure in long term trials, even though exposure adjusted rates 
of TEAEs have not been provided by the Applicant.  
The most common TEAEs in the short term controlled trials, occurring ≥0.5% more often in 
brexpiprazole 2-4 mg treated subjects compared with PBO, where in the SOCs Nervous System 
Disorders (akathisia 5.6%, tremor 2.7%, dizziness 2.3% and sedation 1.9%), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (nausea 3.6%, diarrhoea 3.3%, abdominal pain upper 1.3%) and Investigations (weight 
increased 3.9%, blood CPK increased 2.2%). Most of the common TEAEs by PT occurred in fixed dose 
trials with higher frequency in the 4 mg dose group, compared with lower doses:  akathisia (3.0%, 
4.6%, 6.5% in the brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg groups), weight increased (1.7%, 2.9%, 3.4%), 
diarrhea (2.1%, 3.1%, 3.8%), back pain (1.7%, 2.1%, 2.9%), dizziness (0.9%, 1.5%, 2.9%) in the 
brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg groups, respectively. The types of most frequently reported TEAEs 
in the long term trials were similar to the short-term trials. Akathisia occurred with a higher frequency 
during the stabilization phase of study 331-10-232 compared to the short term controlled trials (9.1% 
vs 5.6%). Blood pressure has been identified as an ADR (in short term controlled trials, TEAEs of blood 
pressure increased occurred in 0.7% of patients in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/ day group compared to 0.1% 
in PBO). 
Weight increase is a common side effect of atypical antipsychotics. Weight gain is a known risk factor for 
the development of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Data from clinical studies 
clearly indicate that brexpiprazole treatment is associated with weight gain: a weight increase that met 
the PCR criterion (increase of ≥7% from baseline in body weight) was observed in a higher percentage 
of subjects treated with brexpiprazole compared with placebo, both in short term controlled trials (9.1% 
in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group vs 3.8% PBO) and in the Double-blind Maintenance phase of 
the long term controlled trial 331-10-232 (5.2% vs 1.0%). At the end of the Stabilization phase of study 
331-10-232 a ≥ 7% increase in body weight was reported for 25/202 subjects (12.4%). The incidence 
of PCR weight increase (increase of ≥7% from baseline in body weight) in the fixed-dose trials showed 
a trend towards dose dependency (4.4%, 7.2%, 9.1% and 8.4% in the brexpiprazole 0.25 mg/day, 1 
mg/day, 2 mg/day, and in the brexpiprazole 4 mg/day groups respectively, compared with 3.3% in the 
placebo group and 12% in the >4 mg group in short term trials.  In the long term open label trials, 
20.7% of subjects had a weight increase that met the PCR criterion (increase of ≥7% from baseline in 
body weight). In short term controlled trials, the incidence of PCR weight increase (increase of ≥7% 
from baseline in body weight) in the 2-4 mg group (9.1%) was higher than the one observed with 
aripiprazole (4%) and lower than the one observed with quetiapine (16.3%), even though the limited 
number of patients included in the groups treated with active comparators should be taken into account 
in the interpretation of these data. 
Weight increase by time period showed a tendency towards an increased incidence over time (1.96%, 
2.24%, 3.31%, 3.89 % at onset time intervals < 8 weeks; ≥ 8 weeks but < 14 weeks; ≥ 14 weeks but 
< 26 weeks; ≥26 weeks but < 52 weeks). In long term open label trials, the incidence of subjects with 
TEAEs of weight increased was higher in the population of subjects who completed 52-weeks of 
treatment (12.5% of completers vs 8.5% of safety sample) than in the pooled population that included 
subjects who were treated for a shorter time period. In long term open label trials -in the subjects who 
had a weight gain meeting the PCR criterion (weight gain ≥7%, 20.7% of subjects at any visit)- weight 
increased over time, with mean weight gains of 7.0, 7.8, 9.0, 10.3, and 10.2 kg at Weeks 8, 14, 26, 38, 
and 52, respectively.   
Due to the progressively lower number of subjects included at longer time intervals, available data do 
not allow to conclusively evaluate increased incidence over time of uncommon/rare TEAEs. Weight gain

is listed among important identified risks in the RMP. In the proposed SmPC weight gain is listed among 
ADRs in section 4.8 and in section 4.4 of the SmPC there is a warning on weight gain recommending 
clinical monitoring of weight and providing the information that the frequency of weight increased 
increases with increased exposure.   
Hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus: In the maintenance phase of the long-term controlled trial 
331-10-232, a higher frequency of patients treated with brexpiprazole (1-4 mg) experienced shifts in 
fasting glucose from normal to high (4.55%) and from normal or impaired (≥100 and <126 mg/dL) to 
high (3.8%), compared to PBO group (0 and 1.3%, respectively), and a slightly higher frequency  of 
subjects met values of Potential Clinical Relevance in fasting glucose [20/89 (22.5%)  in the 
brexpiprazole 1-4 mg, compared to 17/88 (19.3%) in the PBO group]. One serious TEAE of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (from short term controlled study 14644A) considered by the investigator as related 
to IMP, occurred in a in the 2-4 mg dose group, after 20 days of brexpiprazole treatment. TEAEs related 
to blood glucose (including diabetes mellitus) occurred in open label long term schizophrenia trials and 
in ongoing MDD trial, as well as in the US post-marketing setting. Hyperglicaemia has been included as 
important potential risk in the RMP. A warning on hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus has been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, recommending to assess fasting plasma glucose before or soon 
after initiation of antipsychotic medication, and monitor periodically during long term treatment. 
Dyslipidemia: Treatment-emergent AEs related to lipids were reported by 8 (0.7%) subjects in the 
brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group and no subjects in the placebo group. One subject was discontinued 
from IMP because of a TEAE related to lipids (blood triglycerides increased). In the fixed-dose trials 
treatment emergent shifts in fasting lipids from normal at baseline to borderline/high at last visit 
showed a higher frequency for the 4 mg dose group compared to PBO, for fasting total cholesterol, 
fasting LDL and fasting triglycerides. One subject in the brexpiprazole 4 mg group presented shifts in 
fasting triglycerides from normal at baseline to very high (≥500 mg/dl) at last visit, compared to no 
such events occurring in the PBO group or with lower brexpiprazole doses. A warning on weight gain and 
dyslipidaemia has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, recommending to assess fasting lipid 
profile at baseline and monitor periodically weight and lipid profile during treatment. Furthermore, 
blood triglycerides increased are listed among ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia are common adverse reactions of antipsychotic medications, 
even if atypical antipsychotics are considered to have a reduced burden of extrapyramidal symptoms 
and akathisia relative to the older conventional antipsychotics. In short term controlled trials, a 
dose-response relationship for TEAEs related to extrapyramidal symptoms was observed for 
brexpiprazole (4.4%, 7.2%, 9.8%, 14.3% and 24.7% in brexpiprazole dose groups 0.25 mg/day, 1 
mg/day, 2 mg day, 4 mg day in fixed-dose trials and 5±1 mg day in the fixed/flexible trial 331-07-203, 
respectively). A frequency of EPS-related TEAEs higher than PBO (9.9%) was observed only for the 
higher proposed therapeutic brexpiprazole dose (4 mg). A similar pattern (dose-response relationship 
and frequency higher than placebo only for the higher proposed  therapeutic brexpiprazole dose) was 
observed for the two most frequent extrapyramidal symptoms: akathisia events (0, 3.4%, 5.0%, 7,1%, 
16.1% and 5.6%) and parkinsonian events (3.3%, 3.8%, 4.4%, 5.9%, 9.7% and 2.7%) in 
brexpiprazole dose groups 0.25 mg/day, 1 mg/day, 2 mg day, 4 mg day in fixed-dose trials and 5±1 mg 
day in the fixed/flexible trial 331-07-203, and PBO respectively). The incidence of subjects taking EPS 
medication during short term trials increased with brexpiprazole dose (2.2%, 6.7%, 8.2% and 13.5% of 
subjects in brexpiprazole 0.25, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg/ day groups, respectively). Four subjects (0.2%) 
in the short term all brexpiprazole treatment group had TEAEs associated with EPS that were considered 
to be severe and in eight subjects (0.4%) TEAEs associated with EPS led to discontinuation. For most 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 147/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
akathisia events –also in the PBO group- the time of first onset was in the category “study days 8-21”.  
In short term controlled trials, the higher proposed therapeutic brexpiprazole dose (4 mg) seems to 
present a worse safety profile due to a higher frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms TEAEs compared 
with quetiapine (14.3% vs 9.2%) and aripiprazole (12.0%), mostly driven by a higher frequency of 
akathisia events (7.1% vs 3.9% and 4.0 respectively in brexpiprazole 4 mg (n= 477), quetiapine 
(n=153) and aripiprazole (n=50) treated patients), even though the limited number of patients in these 
comparator groups should be considered in the interpretation of data.  
In the double-blind maintenance phase of long-term trial 331-10-32, at least one TEAEs related to EPS 
occurred in 6.19% (6/97) and 4.81% (5/104) of subjects in the brexpiprazole and placebo treatment 
groups respectively. In long-term open label trials, 11% (159/1426) of subjects experienced TEAE 
associated with EPS. In five of these subjects (3%) the events were serious and led to discontinuation 
(4 subjects) or dose reduction (1 subject). In the long-term open label trials there were two events of 
tardive dyskinesia. The Applicant presented also an analysis of assessments of EPS, using 
Extrapyramidal Symptom scales, that confirmed a trend towards a higher frequency of PCR shifts with 
higher brexpiprazole doses. 
In section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC akathisia has been listed as common ADR and Parkinsonism has 
been listed as uncommon ADR; furthermore the information on the dose-response relationship for 
akathisia in patients treated with brexpiprazole, with an increasing frequency with higher doses has 
been provided.  
Available data do not allow to conclude on an association between akathisia and TEAEs related to 
suicidality or violent behaviour in brexpiprazole-treated patients. The issue should be monitored in 
upcoming PSURs. 
Agranulocytosis, Neutropenia, and Leukopenia: In short term controlled trials, a similar proportion of 
subjects experienced these TEAEs between brexpiprazole and PBO treated subjects (0.2 vs 0.4%), no 
such events occurred during the double blind maintenance phase of trial 331-10-232,  and 6 subjects 
(0.42%) in the Long-term open label trials experienced TEAEs of hematopoietic/leukopenia events. In 
the brexpiprazole < 2 mg/day group, 1 subject (0.2%) had a TEAE of agranulocytosis.  Two (2.1%) 
subjects in the brexpiprazole group had PCR values for WBC (one case of decrease ≤2800 and one case 
of increase >16.000), compared with 0 (0.0%) subjects in the placebo group. Cases of leukopenia and 
pancythopenia with brexpiprazole occured in the postmarketing setting (source PADER Apr 2016- July 
2016, PADER Jan 2016 Apr 2016 and PADER July 2015 Oct 2015). As stated by the Applicant in the RMP, 
Leukopenia/neutropenia has been reported during treatment with antipsychotic agents. 
Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has been reported with some agents in the class. Possible risk 
factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count WBC) and history of 
drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Thus a warning on Leukopenia, Neutropenia, and 
Agranulocytosis has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC, similarly to the one present in the FDA 
Rexulti Label (“Perform complete blood counts (CBC) in patients with pre-existing low white blood cell 
count (WBC) or history of leukopenia or neutropenia. Consider discontinuing REXULTI if a clinically 
significant decline in WBC occurs in absence of other causative factors.”). 
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: Cases of Neuroleptic Malignant syndrome occurred in brexpiprazole 
treated patients in the post marketing setting.  Even though the limited available data do not allow to 
definitely conclude on the causal association with brexpiprazole in these specific cases, a causal 
relationship is suspected due to the known association between NMS with administration of 
antipsychotics. Thus Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome has been listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC and 
has been added as important potential risk in the RMP.  A warning regarding Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.

No events of serotonin syndrome were reported in the brexpiprazole CDP. The Applicant conducted a 
search in the safety database for postmarketing events of the PT serotonin syndrome reported with 
Rexulti cumulatively through 25 Jun 2017. As a result of this search 4 events of serotonin syndrome 
were retrieved. In all 4 cases there was a potential confounder due to concomitant antidepressant 
therapy.The occurrence of serotonin syndrome will be followed up in upcoming PSURs. 
Orthostatic hypotension and syncope: In short term controlled trials, TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or 
orthostatic hypotension occurred in 2.8% of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/ day group and 8.6% 
in >4 mg group,  compared with 1.5% in the placebo group. Two subjects had severe events that led to 
discontinuation of IMP: one serious event of dizziness (brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group) and one 
event of syncope (brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day group). Dizziness was the most frequent TEAE of this set 
of events (short term controlled trials: brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group 2.3%, >4 mg: 4.4% vs PBO 1.4%), 
followed by orthostatic hypotension (short term controlled trials: brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group 0.3%, >4 
mg: 2.2% vs PBO 0.1%) and syncope (brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day group 1.1% vs 0 PBO). The incidence 
of TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or orthostatic hypotension observed in the brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group 
(2.8%) and in the 4 mg/ day group (3.1%) was higher than the one observed with aripiprazole (2%) 
and lower than the one observed with quetiapine (14.4%), even though the limited number of patients 
included in the groups treated with active comparators should be taken into account in the 
interpretation of these data. One serious event of syncope occurred in an ongoing MDD trial 
(331-12-282). In the US post marketing setting, 4 events of syncope were reported and three events of 
orthostatic hypotension (PADER 10 Jan 2016 to 9 Apr 2016, 10 July 2016 to 9 Oct 2016). Adequate 
information are provided to the prescriber in section in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, on Orthostatic 
hypotension and syncope, stating that these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment with 
antipsychotics and during dose escalation and that in patients at increased risk of these adverse 
reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension using a lower starting dose 
and slower titration should be considered and orthostatic vital signs should be monitored. Dizziness is 
listed as ADR in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. Furthermore, in section 4.4 of the SmPC a warning 
on cardiovascular disorders has been included, on the need to use brexpiprazole with caution in patients 
with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart 
failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose 
patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medicinal 
products) or hypertension (including accelerated or malignant).  The information that brexpiprazole has 
not been evaluated in patients with a history of myocardial infarction/ ischaemic heart disease or 
clinically significant cardiovascular disease since such patients were excluded from clinical trials has 
been provided to the prescribers. 
Hyperprolactinaemia: Antipsychotics have been shown to elevate prolactin concentrations via 
dopamine D2 antagonism. In short term controlled trials, potentially Clinically Relevant Changes (PCR) 
in prolactin (> 1 ×  ULN) were more frequently observed in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group 
compared with the placebo group, particularly in females (13.7 vs 6.4% in female;11.1 vs 10.3% in 
males).  In the Double blind Maintenance phase, where most patients were males - values for prolactin 
that were > 1 × ULN and > 2 × ULN were each reported for 2 (5.3%) female subjects in the 
brexpiprazole group and 1 (2.6%) female subject in the placebo group.  The incidence of PCR prolactin 
elevations observed in the brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group (13.7%) and in the 4 mg/ day group (15.3%) 
was higher than the one observed with both aripiprazole (0) and quetiapine (8.2%), even though the 
limited number of patients included in the groups treated with active comparators should be taken into 
account in the interpretation of these data. 
The frequencies of shifts from baseline with potential clinical relevance of increase for prolactin in 
patients with normal prolactin values at baseline, as well as mean and median changes from baseline, 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 149/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
showed a trend towards a dose-dependency in female patients, in fixed dose trials. In males smaller 
changes were observed, with smaller differences from placebo. From available data, frequencies of 
prolactin increases from baseline PCR in female patients with normal prolactin at baseline tended to be 
higher in long term uncontrolled trials compared to those observed in short term trials. 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to prolactin (blood prolactin increased, blood prolactin decreased, or 
hyperprolactinemia) were reported in 2.2% (n=17) in the 2-4 mg brexpiprazole-treated groups, 2.2% 
(n=2) in the >4 mg group and in 1.1% (8 subjects) in the placebo group.  All of these TEAEs were 
considered mild or moderate in severity by the investigator.  The dose of IMP was not changed for any 
of these subjects due to the increase in prolactin.  Five of these subjects had a prolactin level > 3 × ULN. 
A search of the clinical database for TEAEs in the SOCs of Reproductive System and Breast Disorders 
and Psychiatric Disorders (sexual function-related AEs; eg, decreased libido, anorgasmia) for the 22 
subjects with TEAEs related to prolactin revealed that they had none of these types of TEAEs in these 
SOCs. In short term controlled trials among subjects with potentially clinically relevant changes (PCR) 
in prolactin (> 1 × ULN), one patients each in brexpiprazole and PBO group experienced dysmenorrea 
and no subjects experienced sexual function related TEAEs. In long term trials among subjects with 
potentially clinically relevant changes (PCR) in prolactin (> 1 × ULN) one patient presented a TEAE of 
menstruation irregular and one patient presented a TEAE of libido decreased. The event was mild in 
severity and was considered possibly related to the study drug. In the short-term trials, TEAEs in the 
SOC reproductive system and breast disorders (including erectile dysfunction, breast tenderness and 
galactorrhea) were reported in 1.6% of subjects in the 2-4 mg brexpiprazole group, 2.2% in the >4 mg 
group, compared to 0.7% in PBO. In long term open label trials, treatment-emergent AEs related to 
prolactin were reported in 23 subjects (1.6%) (hyperprolactinaemia: 9 subjects; blood prolactin 
decreased: 1 subject; blood prolactin increased 13 subjects). In long term open label trials 3 events of 
libido decreased (SOC Psychiatric disorders), 3 events of menstrual disorders, 2 events of menstruation 
irregular, 1 event each of breast discomfort, galactorrhea and hypomenorrhea occurred.  In an ongoing 
MDD trial (331-12-282), two serious TEAEs of breast cancer and intraductal proliferative breast lesion 
occurred. Through US post-marketing experience (Cut-off date October 2016), 5 events of prolactin 
increased/hyperprolactinaemia and 8 events of galactorrhoea have been reported, in addition to other 
reported events of reproductive and breast disorders (e.g. gynecomastia 2 events, sexual dysfunction 
2 events, female breast cancer 1 event, amenorrhoea 1 event) that may be induced by 
hyperprolactinemia. Also in light of nonclinical evidences, the available data do not allow to definitely 
conclude on the relevance of clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia. A warning has been 
included in section 4.4 on the occurrence of hyperprolactinaemia, and hyperprolactinaemia and related 
disorders have been classified as important potential risk in the RMP. Blood prolactin increased has been 
listed as very common ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC.    
QT prolongation: Prolongation of QT interval is a class effect for atypical antipsychotics. In the Thorough 
QT Trial 331-10-242, the by gender subgroup analysis showed significant results (upper bound CI > 10 
msec) in female subjects both at therapeutic (4 mg) e sovratherapeutic (12 mg) brexpiprazole doses 
(see PK section for details). In the Applicant’s opinion the observed differences between genders were 
most likely related to the smaller number of female than male subjects in each treatment group (14 
females versus 48 males for brexpiprazole 4 mg, 13 versus 40 for brexpiprazole 12 mg, and 13 versus 
50 for moxifloxacin). In Short term controlled trials, within the proposed therapeutic 2-4 mg dose, the 
incidence of TEAEs related to QT prolongation was comparable between brexpiprazole (0.3%) and 
placebo (0.5%), while a higher frequency was observed in the brexpiprazole > 4 mg group (3.2%) 
groups. Also regarding frequencies of categorical changes in QT, frequencies higher than in PBO were 
observed only in the brexpiprazole >4 mg group (QTcF ≥ 450 msec 4.4% vs 2.9%; increase in QTcF 
interval of ≥ 60 msec: 1.1% vs 0.1%) and for the 2-4 g dose only for increase in QTcF interval of ≥ 60 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 150/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
msec: 0.3% vs 0.1%). Available data on frequencies of categorical changes in QT by dose up to 4 mg 
dose in fixed-dose short-term controlled trials do not show dose dependency in QTcB or QTcF increases 
in brexpiprazole treated patients. In long-term open label trials a new onset QTcF interval over 500 
msec and new onset QTcB intervals over 500 msec were each reported in 1 (0.1%) subject (both 
prolongations were in Subject), compared to no QTc interval increases over 500 ms in short term 
controlled trials; a total of 7 subjects (0.5%) had a TEAE related to QT prolongation. There were 8 
TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged in 7 subjects. All were considered related to IMP. Two subjects were 
withdrawn from IMP. An elderly subject with MDD (Subject, treated with brexpiprazole) was 
discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged that was assessed as related 
to IMP. In long term controlled trial 331-10-232 the incidence of increases of QTcB > 60 msec was 3.2% 
(3 subjects) in the brexpiprazole group compared with 1.0% (1 subject) in the placebo group. With 
regard to the post marketing experience of QT prolongation with brexpiprazole, a search conducted in 
the Applicant’s safety database for post marketing events of electrocardiogram QT prolonged reported 
with Rexulti cumulatively through 25 Jun 2017 retrieved 3 events. Of these, one was reported as 
serious and one led to withdrawal. The post-marketing cases of electrocardiogram QT prolonged each 
present limited information with confounding histories of cardiac events and concomitant medications, 
co-suspect medication, or unknown medical and past drug histories. On the basis of the above, QT 
prolongation has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC (frequency unkown). A warning on QT 
prolongation has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC on the need to exercise caution when 
brexpiprazole is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or family history of QT 
prolongation, electrolyte imbalance, and in concomitant use with other medicinal products thought to 
prolong the QT interval, with cross reference to section 4.8 and 5.1. In section 4.8 of the SmPC, the 
information that subgroup analyses from the thorough QTc trial suggested that the QTc prolongation 
was larger in female subjects than in males has been provided to prescribers, with cross reference to 
section 5.1. 
Creatine Phosphokinase Elevation and Rhabdomyolysis:  In short term controlled trials, in the all 
brexpiprazole treatment group, 7.7% of subjects had a PCR CPK value (≥3 x ULN), compared with 5.5% 
in the placebo group. During the Double blind Maintenance phase of trial 331-10-232, the incidence of 
PCR changes in CPK (≥ 3 × ULN) was lower in the brexpiprazole group (1 subject [1.1%]) compared 
with the placebo group (4 subjects [4.0%]). In the long-term, open-label trials, a total of 109 subjects 
(8.1%) had PCR CPK test results (≥ 3 × ULN); among these, 44 subjects (3.1%) had a PCR CPK value 
≥ 5 × ULN, 27 subjects (1.9%) had a PCR CPK ≥ 7 × ULN, and 12 subjects (0.8%) had a PCR CPK ≥ 10 
× ULN. Blood creatinine phosphokinase increased has been included in the Table of ADRs in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. In section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction) 
the information that, in case of co-administration with drugs known to increase CPK, the possible 
additive effect with CPK increase induced by brexpiprazole should be considered has been provided to 
prescribers.  
Rhabdomyolysis is a known class effect of antipsychotics. At least one event of rhabdomyolysis possibly 
related to brexpiprazole occurred in brexpiprazole CDP and at least one further event for which a causal 
relationship with brexpiprazole may not be excluded occurred in the post-marketing section. Thus 
rhabdomyolysis has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Seizures: The frequency of seizures related TEAEs was similar in short term controlled trial, between the 
2-4 mg brexpiprazole dose group and placebo (2 subjects in each group, 0.16% vs 0.27%); a (Patient, 
from study 14644A) -with no relevant medical history- experienced a serious event,  severe in intensity, 
of grand mal convulsion, leading to withdrawal from the study, 4 days after the first dose of 
brexpiprazole 4 mg. In long term controlled trial 331-10-232 one event of convulsion was reported in a 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 151/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
subject treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg. Two events of seizures (one serious) occurred in long term, 
open label trials, both leading to withdrawal. Seizures have been listed as ADRs in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC, based on the observations of seizures both in animal and human studies, and the fact that 
seizure is a known class effect attributed to antipsychotics. 
Somnolence: The TEAEs related to somnolence (hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence) showed a 
dose relationship with higher frequencies observed with higher doses (1.1%, 2.6%, 3.1%, 4.6% in the 
brexpiprazole 0.25, 1, 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day  short term fixed dose groups and 10.8% in the >4 
mg/day short term controlled trials). The incidence of somnolence events was higher in the 4 mg/day 
brexpiprazole group, compared to placebo group (4.6% vs 2.9%). The incidence of TEAEs related to 
somnolence with brexpiprazole was comparable to the one observed with aripiprazole (4.0%) and lower 
compared to the one observed with quetiapine (26.1%), even though the limited number of patients 
included in the groups treated with active comparators should be taken into account in the 
interpretation of these data. There were no serious TEAEs related to somnolence and no subject 
discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE related to somnolence.  With the exception of one event of severe 
sedation, all other TEAEs related to somnolence were mild or moderate in severity.  There were no 
reports of somnolence, hypersomnia, or sedation within the Nervous System Disorders SOC in any 
treatment group during the Double blind Maintenance phase of trial 331 10 232. A TEAE related to 
somnolence was reported by 60 subjects (4.2%) in the long-term open-label trial.  One subject was 
discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE related to somnolence.  There was 1 serious TEAE related to 
somnolence.  The dose of IMP was not changed and the event resolved. In section 4.8 of the SmPC 
sedation is listed as common ADR. 
Suicidality: In short-term, controlled Trials, TEAEs related to suicidality were reported by 8 subjects 
(0.5%, 2 serious events, 1 leading to discontinuation) in the all brexpiprazole treatment group and 3 
subjects (0.4%, none serious) in the placebo group. In long-term, Open-label Trials, TEAEs related to 
suicidality were reported for 23 subjects (1.6%).   In Brexpiprazole CDP, one death due to suicide 
occurred in schizophrenia trials, considered not drug related by the investigator, and 2 deaths due to 
suicide occurred in MDD trials; one of these case was considered possibly related by the investigator. 
Spontaneous cases reporting completed suicide and suicide attempt were reported in the 
postmarketing setting. Suicidal ideation and suicidal attempt have been listed as uncommon ADRs in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. In section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC, a warning related to Suicidality has been 
included.  
Since non-clinical and clinical data available at the time of the initial marketing authorisation do not 
allow to rule out a possible association between hypothermia and brexpiprazole administration, 
hypothermia should be monitored in upcoming PSURs. Hypothermia should be monitored in upcoming 
PSURs. 
In controlled schizophrenia clinical trials, no deaths occurred in the PBO arm, compared with three 
deaths (0.1%) in brexpiprazole arms; one found dead 12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole 
trial, cause of death unknown; for the other two cases of death there were confounding factors/ 
alternative explanations (12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole trial; ). Other 6 deaths 
occurred in schizophrenia open-label trials, all considered not drug related by the investigators (gastric 
ulcer perforation/peritonitis: , with no confounding factors, treated with brexpiprazole 2 mg, uterine 
cancer in a treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg/ day; for the other cases of death -septic shock, cardiac 
failure, coronary artery disease, completed suicide- there were possible confounding factors). In MDD 
trials no deaths occurred during the controlled treatment period, while 7 subjects died during the long 
term open label brexpiprazole trials (2 cases of completed suicide;  one case each of: metastatic 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 152/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
malignant melanoma, pulmonary embolism, gastric ulcer perforation/peritonitis , ovarian cancer, acute 
myocardial infarction/ myocardial rupture), all considered not drug related by the investigator, apart 
from one case of completed suicide considered possibly related; for all the 7 cases of death possible 
confounding factors were in place. 
Other Serious AEs occurred with similar frequencies in short term controlled schizophrenia trials 
between brexpiprazole (3.4%) and placebo (4.2%). The serious TEAEs reported by more than 1 subject 
in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group were predominately in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC, 
including schizophrenia and psychotic disorder.   
Concerning laboratory findings, due to the higher frequency in brexpiprazole treated subjects compared 
to PBO in the maintenance phase of long term controlled trial 331-10-232 of ALT and AST increased, of 
TEAEs associated with hepatic function, and of discontinuation due to TEAEs related to hepatic function 
in long term controlled trial 331-10-232, hepatic enzyme increased has been listed as ADR in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. 
Only 5 subjects aged ≥65 years were included in short term controlled trials. No subject aged ≥63 years 
old was enrolled in the long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232. In long term open label trials only 30 
subjects aged ≥65 years old were enrolled. Elderly patients are expected to have a worse safety profile 
with antipsychotics. Per clinical trials inclusion criteria, only patients up to 65 years of age were included 
in clinical trials. Available data do not allow to assess brexpiprazole safety in schizophrenic elderly 
patients. Adequate information has been provided to prescribers in the SmPC.  
The information on the higher frequency of vomiting and nausea observed in females compared to 
males in short term trials should be added in section 4.8 of the SmPC, with cross reference to section 
5.2 of the SmPC, where the information on the  higher exposure (AUC) of brexpiprazole in women  is 
provided. 
In short term controlled schizophrenia trials TEAEs corresponding to PTs in the SMQ of gastrointestinal 
perforation, ulceration, haemorrhage or obstruction occurred with similar frequency between 
brexpiprazole treated subjects (8/1748, 0.45%) and PBO (2/740, 0.3%), with one serious event in each 
group. In long term open label schizophrenia trials, 9 events of gastrointestinal disorders were 
reported. Among these, 4 serious events including one with fatal outcome were identified. None of 
these events were assessed as related to the study drug by the Investigator. One fatal event of gastric 
ulcer was reported in the long term open label MDD study trial 331-10-238, considered by the 
Investigator not to be related to study treatment. Available data do not allow to conclude on a causal 
association between brexpiprazole treatment and gastric ulcers; the occurrence of gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage during brexpiprazole treatment should be monitored in upcoming PSURs. 
2.1.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall exposure to the drug has been relatively extensive, especially taking into account 
post-marketing experience. 
Brexpiprazole safety appears overall in line with known antipsychotic class effects. Data from clinical 
studies clearly indicate that brexpiprazole treatment is associated with weight gain, extrapyramidal 
symptoms -including akathisia-, hyperprolactinaemia, CPK increase, dizziness and sedation.  
The Applicant provided a comparison of safety data available for brexpiprazole with data available for 
other antipsychotics, using both data coming from US product labels and published data. Despite the 
limitations of the indirect comparison (for instance different definitions of EPS related TEAE were used 
and safety data from different dose ranges for each antipsychotic were pooled together), from the 
available data brexpiprazole compared with aripiprazole appears to have a lower frequency of sedating 
AEs and insomnia, a similar frequency of akathisia and EPS adverse events and a higher frequency of 
long term weight gain. A dose-dependency was observed in the frequency of the following TEAEs: 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 153/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
akathisia (3.4%, 5.0%, 7.1%, respectively in brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg; compared to 5.6% 
in PBO), parkinsonism (3.8%, 4.4%, 5.9% respectively in brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg; 
compared to 2.7% in PBO) and somnolence (2.6%, 3.1%, 4.6%, respectively in brexpiprazole 1 mg, 2 
mg and 4 mg; compared to 2.9% in PBO). Weight gain increases with increased exposure.  
Brexpiprazole appears to offer no clear advantages over other newer 2nd generation antipsychotics in 
terms of the common safety issues associated with this class of drug e.g. motor effects (EPS) or 
metabolic effects; however indirect evidences suggest a lower risk of sedation compared to other 
antipsychotics. No new and unexpected safety signals have been identified with brexpiprazole, but no 
robust direct evidence has been provided to support any claims of improved safety, compared to other 
similar partial agonist antipsychotics, either.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 (dated 20 April 2018) is 
acceptable.  
2.3.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The summary includes the following elements: 
· 
· 
· 
· 
Proof that the applicant has at his disposal a qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance 
The Member States in which the qualified person resides and carries out his/her tasks 
The contact details of the qualified person 
A statement signed by the applicant to the effect that the applicant has the necessary means to 
fulfil the  
tasks and responsibilities listed in Title IX of Directive 2001/83/EC 
· 
A reference to the location where the pharmacovigilance system master file for the medicinal 
product is  
kept. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 10th July 2015. The new EURD list entry will therefore 
use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.4.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of brexpiprazole with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers brexpiprazole to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.5.  Product information 
2.5.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
EMA/556923/2018

applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.5.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, RXULTI (brexpiprazole) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as per the following reason: 
- 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product  
authorised in the EU; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Brexpiprazole is intended for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. Schizophrenia is a severely 
debilitating psychotic disorder; symptoms are classified as so-called positive (delusions, hallucinations, 
disorganised speech, and disorganised or catatonic behaviours) and negative (affective flattening, 
restriction in the fluency and productivity of thought and speech and in the initiation of goal directed 
behaviour). In addition, cognitive deficits are common. The positive symptoms appear to reflect an 
excess or distortion of normal functions, whereas negative symptoms reflect a diminution or loss of 
normal function. A patient usually gradually recovers from the first episode of schizophrenia. However, 
relapses are common, and pattern of the illness during the first 5 years indicates generally the course. 
The aim of therapy is to treat acute episodes and control symptoms in the long term preventing further 
relapses.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need  
Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay treatment for schizophrenia in addition to psychosocial 
interventions. Antipsychotics diminish symptoms and reduce relapse rates. Antipsychotics have a wide 
variety of pharmacological properties but they all have a capacity to antagonize postsynaptic dopamine 
receptors in the brain. Only 10-20% of schizophrenia patients have been described to achieve a good 
outcome. It has been estimated that 20-30% continue to experience moderate symptoms and 40-60% 
remain significantly impaired. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs) are the agents of 
choice for first-line treatment of schizophrenia. Clozapine is not recommended because of its risk of 
agranulocytosis. SGAs are usually preferred over first-generation (typical) antipsychotics (FGAs) 
because they are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. However, SGAs tend to have 
metabolic side effects, such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Since adverse effects 
can contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality observed in schizophrenia patients. The 
hypothetical expectations of brexpiprazole’s benefit in treating schizophrenia has been based on its 
receptor profile and similarities with aripiprazole. Brexpiprazole is expected to have an efficacy 
comparable with currently available SGAs and a more favourable side effects profile, with less EPSs and 
metabolic adverse events. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Efficacy of brexpiprazole was studied in three 6 weeks, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled pivotal trials 
(331-10-231 and 331-10-230), one of which is a regional study conducted in Japan (331-10-002). In 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 158/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition, another pivotal study was a six-weeks, flexible-dose study with active reference quetiapine 
(14644A). A 6-weeks dose-finding study with active reference aripiprazole was also conducted (203). 
A relapse prevention study with a randomized withdrawal phase was conducted to assess long-term 
maintenance efficacy of brexpiprazole in schizophrenia (331-10-232). 
Each of the three fixed-dose trials investigated the efficacy and safety of the dose of 2mg/day and 
4mg/day, but also had a lower dose arm. With the exception of the 002 regional study, the 
randomization was imbalanced with fewer patients in the lower doses arms. In the 231 study the lower 
dose was 0.25mg (3:3:2:3 randomization), in the 230 study the lower dose was 1mg (2:2:1:2 
randomization) and in the 002 trial the lower dose was 1mg (1:1:1:1 randomization).  
The titration scheme differs between the fixed dose trials (maximum dose of 4 mg is reached in 7 days) 
and the flexible dose trial (maximum dose of 4mg/day is reached in 4 days). In the latter, the titration 
scheme is faster to allow a comparison with the established quetiapine titration scheme.  
All 4 short term trials have the same primary endpoint which is “change from baseline to week 6 in the 
PANSS total score”. The PANSS is an established and clinically meaningful endpoint and the choice of 
the same primary outcome measure for all trials allows comparability. As per Guidelines the CGI-S scale 
was chosen as a key secondary endpoint to allow assessment of clinical meaningfulness.  
Trial 331-10-232 is a multicentre double blind placebo controlled relapse prevention trial to assess the 
efficacy safety and tolerability of brexpiprazole (1 to 4mg/day) as maintenance treatment in adult 
patients with schizophrenia. The trial consisted of a screening period during which eligibility criteria 
were assessed; a period for conversion from other antipsychotic(s) to oral brexpiprazole and washout of 
prohibited concomitant medications, if applicable; a single-blind treatment phase to stabilize subjects 
on oral brexpiprazole; a double-blind randomization phase to assess maintenance of effect, and a 
post-treatment follow-up for safety monitoring. The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the time 
from randomization to impending relapse.  
All trials, with the exception of study 202 (Japan) enrolled also patients from the EU. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The first pivotal phase 3 study (331-10-231) supports efficacy of brexpiprazole at the doses of 2 and 4 
mg/day in terms of reduction of symptoms as measured by the PANSS. The mean reduction of PANSS 
total score at week 6 was -20.73 for the group treated with 2mg and was -19.65 for the group treated 
with 4mg, therefore the separation from placebo (LS mean -12) was statistically significant (p<0.0001 
and p=0.0006, respectively). Patients treated with the dose of 0.25 improved minimally (LS mean 
change from baseline -14.90), although the power calculated for the 0.25 arm was less than 70% 
(imbalanced randomization). Efficacy is also supported by the results at the key secondary endpoint 
change from baseline to week 6 in the CGI-S score. The LS mean of the brexpiprazole 2mg treatment 
arm was -1.20 therefore the separation from placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0056), the same 
applies for the 4mg treatment arm (LS mean -1.15), which separated significantly from placebo 
(p=0.0012). Patients treated with the dose of 0.25 improved minimally (LS mean change from baseline 
-0.85).  
The second phase 3 short term pivotal study (331-10-230) supports an effect of brexpiprazole in 
reducing schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS but only at the dose of 4 mg. During the 
trial, patients on brexpiprazole 4mg improved significantly after 6 weeks as compared to placebo 
patients (LS mean -20 points; -13.53, respectively). The groups treated with the dose of 1mg and 2 mg 
showed similar numeric improvement (-16.9, -16.6 respectively) despite this being not statistically 
significant. The onset of efficacy, when measured at the PANSS, was already significant at week 1, but 
only in the 4 mg arm. The difference in CGI-S scores between treatment and placebo showed a similar 
pattern where only patients in the 4mg arm separated significantly from placebo (-1.19 LS mean vs 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 159/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
-0.81 treatment and placebo respectively). Numeric improvement in the 2mg and 1mg arms was 
similar. 
In the regional phase 3 study (331-10-002) results support the efficacy of brexpiprazole in reducing 
schizophrenia symptoms as measured by the PANSS but only at the dose of 2 mg. The group treated 
with 2 mg improved substantially (LS mean change -14.95, p=0.0124). This difference appeared at 
week 3 of treatment and remained trough the study period.  The group treated with 4 mg improved less 
(-3.86 difference from placebo, not statistically significant). The lowest numerical improvement was 
observed in the group treated with 1mg. Analyses of the CGI-S showed no significant difference from 
placebo. In a clinical perspective, it is noted that the analyses of secondary outcomes shows an effect 
on the negative symptoms domain, both at the PANSS negative subscale (LS mean was −3.48 in the 2 
mg group and −3.24 in the 4 mg group, vs −1.20 in the placebo group) and at the Marder factor score 
negative symptoms where the 2 and 4 mg groups separated from placebo; the 2 mg group separated 
from placebo also in the disorganized though Marder factor. In the positive symptom factor there was 
no separation from placebo. 
In the flexible dose, active and placebo controlled study 14644A, the group treated with the dose range 
of 2-4 mg brexpiprazole failed to separate from placebo at the primary endpoint. Placebo patients 
showed a mean reduction in PANSS total scores at week 6 of -15.9 (the highest placebo response of all 
trials), therefore the improvement with brexpiprazole (LS mean change -20) was not sufficient to 
achieve statistical difference, whilst patients treated with flexible doses of quetiapine XR improved on 
average by -24 points therefore this different was statistically significant in comparison to placebo. 
When measuring the differences in reduction of PANSS total scores between the brexpiprazole group 
and the placebo group at weeks 2, 3 and 4, the difference was statistically significant, confirming an 
onset of therapeutic effect at week two, like most antipsychotics. The difference in CGI-S scores 
between the brexpiprazole group and placebo was statistically significant (LS mean -1.2 vs -0.9 for 
placebo, p=0.0142), although the numeric improvement was slightly inferior to that of the quetiapine 
group (LS mean -1.4, p=0.0002). A responder analysis of trial 14644A used relative risk to demonstrate 
that both quetiapine and brexpiprazole differentiated from placebo for reduction in PANSS scores of 
≥30% and ≥ 40% but not ≥50% which fails for both active treatments.  
The relapse prevention trial (331-10-232), was stopped at the first interim analysis for demonstration 
of efficacy. Indeed, relapse was significantly delayed in the brexpiprazole group as compared to placebo 
(p=0.0008) and subjects treated with brexpiprazole had 66% lower risk of experiencing impending 
relapse compared to placebo.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A limitation in the assessment of efficacy comes from the fact that the two active comparator studies 
203 (a dose finding study) and 14644A were negative. While in study 203 neither brexpiprazole, or 
aripiprazole separated from placebo, in study 14644A assay sensitivity was demonstrated and in all 
comparisons, including the sensitivity analyses, the magnitude of PANSS scores reduction was greater 
for the quetiapine group than for the brexpiprazole group. In this study the dosing regimen was flexible 
more representative of the proposed dosing regimen. Due to this difference, the results from this study 
cannot be integrated into pooled analyses or meta-analyses with the results from other short term 
studies. 
Despite the evidence of a reduction in the PANSS scores with the 4 mg dose and also with the 2 mg dose 
of brexpiprazole, data do not allow a comparison with currently available treatments, other SGAs or 
aripiprazole. It is not possible to state if the efficacy of brexpiprazole is comparable to that of other 
SGAs. The only evidence points towards a smaller effect as compared to quetiapine.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
As of the data cut-off date, 3450 subjects with schizophrenia have been exposed to brexpiprazole. In 
the entire brexpiprazole CDP, 7020 subjects in phase 2/3 trials (for MDD, schizophrenia, ADHD, and 
PTSD) and 877 subjects in clinical pharmacology trials have been exposed to at least 1 dose of 
brexpiprazole in clinical trials conducted in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. 
The clinical pharmacology trials conducted in the brexpiprazole CDP include diverse populations (male 
and female subjects, healthy subjects, subjects with psychiatric diseases [including schizophrenia, 
MDD, and ADHD], subjects with hepatic or renal impairment, and limited numbers of elderly subjects), 
different trial designs, and doses ranging from 0.2 mg/day to 12 mg/day (1 mg/day to 12 mg/day for 
schizophrenia). 
Brexpiprazole safety appears overall in line with known antipsychotic class effects. Data from clinical 
studies clearly indicate that brexpiprazole treatment is associated with weight gain, extrapyramidal 
symptoms -including akathisia-, hyperprolactinaemia, CPK increase, dizziness and sedation. The safety 
profile of the highest recommended dose (4 mg) appears worse compared with lower brexpiprazole 
doses.  
Weight gain ≥7% from baseline occurred with a considerable higher frequency in long term open label 
trials (20.7%) compared to short term trials (9.1%). In long term open label trials -in the subjects who 
had a weight gain meeting the PCR criterion (weight gain ≥7%, 20.7% of subjects at any visit)- weight 
increased over time, with mean weight gains of 7.0, 7.8, 9.0, 10.3, and 10.2 kg at Weeks 8, 14, 26, 38, 
and 52, respectively.  
In long term controlled maintenance trials, shifts in fasting glucose from normal to high occurred in 
4.5% of BRX treated subjects compared to no such shifts in PBO. TEAEs related to blood glucose 
(including diabetes mellitus) occurred in open label long term schizophrenia trials, in an ongoing MDD 
trial, and in the US post-marketing setting. In short term trials, one serious TEAE of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus  considered by the investigator as related to IMP, occurred in a, 20 days after the first BRX 
dose. 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to lipids were reported by 8 subjects (0.7%) in the brexpiprazole 2 to 
4 mg/day group and no subjects in the placebo group. One subject was discontinued from IMP because 
of a TEAE related to lipids (blood triglycerides increased). In the fixed-dose trials treatment emergent 
shifts in fasting lipids from normal at baseline to borderline/high at last visit showed a higher frequency 
for the 4 mg dose group compared to PBO, for fasting total cholesterol, fasting LDL and fasting 
triglycerides. One subject in the brexpiprazole 4 mg group presented shifts in fasting triglycerides from 
normal at baseline to very high (≥500 mg/dl) at last visit, compared to no such events occurring in the 
PBO group or with lower brexpiprazole doses.  
In short term controlled trials, a dose-response relationship for TEAEs related to extrapyramidal 
symptoms was observed for brexpiprazole (4.4%, 7.2%, 9.8%, 14.3% and 24.7% in brexpiprazole 
dose groups 0.25 mg/day, 1 mg/day, 2 mg day, 4 mg day in fixed-dose trials and 5±1 mg day in the 
fixed/flexible trial 331-07-203, respectively). A frequency of EPS-related TEAEs higher than PBO 
(9.9%) was observed only for the higher proposed therapeutic brexpiprazole dose (4 mg). A similar 
pattern (dose-response relationship and frequency higher than placebo only for the higher proposed  
therapeutic brexpiprazole dose) was observed for the two most frequent extrapyramidal symptoms: 
akathisia events (0, 3.4%, 5.0%, 7,1%, 16.1% and 5.6%) and parkinsonian events (3.3%, 3.8%, 
4.4%, 5.9%, 9.7% and 2.7%) in brexpiprazole dose groups 0.25 mg/day, 1 mg/day, 2 mg day, 4 mg 
day in fixed-dose trials and 5±1 mg day in the fixed/flexible trial 331-07-203, and PBO respectively). 
The incidence of subjects taking EPS medication during short term trials increased with brexpiprazole 
dose (2.2%, 6.7%, 8.2% and 13.5% of subjects in brexpiprazole 0.25, 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg/ day 
groups, respectively). Four subjects (0.2%) in the short term all brexpiprazole treatment group had 
TEAEs associated with EPS that were considered to be severe and in eight subjects (0.4%) TEAEs 
EMA/556923/2018

associated with EPS led to discontinuation. For most akathisia events –also in the PBO group - the time 
of first onset was in the category “study days 8-21”. In the double-blind maintenance phase of 
long-term trial 331-10-32, at least one TEAEs related to EPS occurred in 6.19% (6/97) and 4.81% 
(5/104) of subjects in the brexpiprazole and placebo treatment groups respectively. In long-term open 
label trials, 11% (159/1426) of subjects experienced TEAE associated with EPS. In five of these subjects 
(3%) the events were serious and led to discontinuation (4 subjects) or dose reduction (1 subject). In 
the long-term open label trials dyskinesia occurred in 1.2% of subjects, with two events of tardive 
dyskinesia occuring in subjects exposed in the time interval >=52 weeks (2/458). 
Cases of Neuroleptic Malignant syndrome occurred in brexpiprazole treated patients in the post 
marketing setting (source PADER July 2016 – Oct 2016, PADER Jan 2016 Apr 2016). 
Hyperprolactinaemia: In short term controlled trials, potentially Clinically Relevant changes (PCR) in 
prolactin (> 1 × ULN) were more frequently observed in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group 
compared with the placebo group, particularly in females (13.7 vs 6.4% in female; 11.1 vs 10.3% in 
males).  In the Double blind Maintenance phase, where most patients were males-  values for prolactin 
that were > 2 × ULN were reported for 2 (5.3%) female subjects in the brexpiprazole group and 1 
(2.6%) female subject in the placebo group. Cases of reproductive and breast disorders that may be 
induced by hyperprolactinemia (e.g. erectile dysfunction, breast tenderness, galactorrhea, 
gynecomastia, breast cancer) occured in subjects treated with brexpiprazole either in short term trial or 
in post marketing experience. 
CPK increase:  In short term controlled trials, in the all brexpiprazole treatment group, 7.7% of subjects 
had a PCR CPK value (≥3 x ULN), compared with 5.5% in the placebo group. During the Double blind 
Maintenance phase of trial 331-10-232, the incidence of PCR changes in CPK (≥ 3 × ULN) was lower in 
the brexpiprazole group (1 subject [1.1%]) compared with the placebo group (4 subjects [4.0%]). In 
the long-term, open-label trials, a total of 109 subjects (8.1%) had PCR CPK test results (≥ 3 × ULN); 
among these, 44 subjects (3.1%) had a PCR CPK value ≥ 5 × ULN, 27 subjects (1.9%) had a PCR CPK 
≥ 7 × ULN, and 12 subjects (0.8%) had a PCR CPK ≥ 10 × ULN.  
In short term controlled trials, TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or orthostatic hypotension occurred in 2.8% 
of subjects in the brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/ day group and 8.6% in >4 mg group,  compared with 1.5% in 
the placebo group. Two subjects had severe events that led to discontinuation of IMP: one serious event 
of dizziness (brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group) and one event of syncope (brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day 
group). Dizziness was the most frequent TEAE of this set of events (short term controlled trials: 
brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group 2.3%, >4 mg: 4.4% vs PBO 1.4%), followed by orthostatic hypotension 
(short term controlled trials: brexpiprazole 2-4 mg group 0.3%, >4 mg: 2.2% vs PBO 0.1%) and 
syncope (brexpiprazole > 4 mg/day group 1.1% vs 0 PBO). One serious event of syncope occurred in an 
ongoing MDD trial (331-12-282). In the US post marketing setting, 4 events of syncope were reported 
and three events of orthostatic hypotension (PADER 10 Jan 2016 to 9 Apr 2016, 10 July 2016 to 9 Oct 
2016). 
TEAEs related to somnolence (hypersomnia, sedation, and somnolence) showed a dose relationship 
with higher frequencies observed with higher doses (1.1%, 2.6%, 3.1%, 4.6% in the brexpiprazole 
0.25, 1, 2 mg/day and 4 mg/day  short term fixed dose groups and 10.8% in the >4 mg/day short term 
controlled trials). There were no serious TEAEs related to somnolence and no subject discontinued from 
IMP due to a TEAE related to somnolence.  With the exception of one event of severe sedation, all other 
TEAEs related to somnolence were mild or moderate in severity.  There were no reports of somnolence, 
hypersomnia, or sedation within the Nervous System Disorders SOC in any treatment group during the 
Double blind Maintenance phase of trial 331 10 232. A TEAE related to somnolence was reported by 60 
subjects (4.2%) in the long-term open-label trial.  One subject was discontinued from IMP due to a 
TEAE related to somnolence.  There was 1 serious TEAE related to somnolence.  The dose of IMP was not 
changed and the event resolved.

Prolongation of QT interval is a class effect for atypical antipsychotics. Non-clinical brexpiprazole 
studies, support an effect of brexpiprazole on QT prolongation. In the Thorough QT Trial 331-10-242, 
the by gender subgroup analysis showed significant results (upper bound CI > 10 msec) in female 
subjects both at therapeutic (4 mg) and supratherapeutic (12 mg) brexpiprazole doses (see PK section 
for details). In Short term controlled trials, within the proposed therapeutic 2-4 mg dose, the incidence 
of QT prolongation was comparable between brexpiprazole and placebo. Frequencies higher than in PBO 
were observed only in the brexpiprazole >4 mg group (QTcF ≥ 450 msec 4.4% vs 2.9%; increase in 
QTcF interval of ≥ 60 msec: 1.1% vs 0.1%) and for the 2-4 g dose only for increase in QTcF interval of 
≥ 60 msec: 0.3% vs 0.1%). Available data on frequencies of categorical changes in QT by dose in 
fixed-dose short-term controlled trials do not show dose dependency in QTcB or QTcF increases in 
brexpiprazole treated patients between 0.25 and 4 mg dose. In long-term open label trials a new onset 
QTcF interval over 500 msec and new onset QTcB intervals over 500 msec were each reported in 1 
(0.1%) subject (both prolongations were in Subject); a total of 7 subjects (0.5%) had a TEAE related to 
QT prolongation. There were 8 TEAEs of ECG QT prolonged in 7 subjects. All were considered related to 
IMP. Two subjects were withdrawn from IMP. An elderly subject with MDD (Subject, treated with 
brexpiprazole) was discontinued from IMP due to a TEAE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged that was 
assessed as related to IMP. In long term controlled trial 331-10-232 the incidence of increases of QTcB 
> 60 msec was 3.2% (3 subjects) in the brexpiprazole group compared with 1.0% (1 subject) in the 
placebo group. The post-marketing cases of electrocardiogram QT prolonged (3 events retrieved 
cumulatively cumulatively through 25 Jun 2017 retrieved 3 events, one serious and one leading to 
withdrawal) each present limited information with confounding histories of cardiac events and 
concomitant medications, co-suspect medication, or unknown medical and past drug histories. On the 
basis of the above, QT prolongation has been listed among ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. A warning 
on QT prolongation has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC providing information on the need to 
exercise caution when brexpiprazole is prescribed in patients with known cardiovascular disease or 
family history of QT prolongation, electrolyte imbalance, and in concomitant use with other medicinal 
products thought to prolong the QT interval, with cross reference to section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The frequency of seizures related TEAEs was similar in short term controlled trial, between the 2-4 mg 
brexpiprazole dose group and placebo (2 subjects in each group, 0.16% vs 0.27%); a (Patient, from 
study 14644A) -with no relevant medical history- experienced a serious event,  severe in intensity, of 
grand mal convulsion, leading to withdrawal from the study, 4 days after the first dose of brexpiprazole 
4 mg. In long term controlled trial 331-10-232 one event of convulsion was reported in a subject treated 
with brexpiprazole 4 mg. Two events of seizures (one serious) occurred in long term, open label trials, 
both leading to withdrawal. Seizures are considered ADRs, based on the observations of seizures both 
in animal and human studies, and the fact that seizure is a known class effect attributed to 
antipsychotics. 
Blood pressure has been identified as an ADR (in short term controlled trials, TEAEs of blood pressure 
increased occurred in 0.7% of patients in brexpiprazole 2-4 mg/ day group compared to 0.1% in PBO). 
In short-term, controlled Trials, TEAEs related to suicidality were reported by 8 subjects (0.5%, 2 
serious events, 1 leading to discontinuation) in the all brexpiprazole treatment group and 3 subjects 
(0.4%, none serious) in the placebo group. In long-term, Open-label Trials, TEAEs related to suicidality 
were reported for 23 subjects (1.6%). In Brexpiprazole CDP, one death due to suicide occurred in 
schizophrenia trials, considered not drug related by the investigator, and 2 deaths due to suicide 
occurred in MDD trials; one of these case was considered possibly related by the investigator. 
Spontaneous cases reporting completed suicide and suicide attempt were reported in the 
postmarketing setting. In section 4 of the Patient Leaflet, among possible side effects the following is 
listed “thoughts or feelings about hurting yourself or to commit suicide or a suicide attempt”. Even 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 163/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
though available data do not allow to draw definitive conclusions, the occurrence of cases of suicidal 
ideation and suicidal attempt should be described also in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In controlled schizophrenia clinical trials, no deaths occurred in the PBO arm, compared with three 
deaths (0.1%) in brexpiprazole arms; one found dead 12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole 
trial, cause of death unknown; for the other two cases of death there were confounding factors/ 
alternative explanations (12 days after the end of a 6 weeks brexpiprazole trial;). Other 6 deaths 
occurred in schizophrenia open-label trials, all considered not drug related by the investigators (gastric 
ulcer perforation/peritonitis:, with no confounding factors, treated with brexpiprazole 2 mg, uterine 
cancer in a treated with brexpiprazole 4 mg/ day; for the other cases of death -septic shock, cardiac 
failure, coronary artery disease, completed suicide- there were possible confounding factors). In MDD 
trials no deaths occurred during the controlled treatment period, while 7 subjects died during the long 
term open label brexpiprazole trials (2 cases of completed suicide;  one case each of: metastatic 
malignant melanoma, pulmonary embolism, gastric ulcer perforation/peritonitis , ovarian cancer, acute 
myocardial infarction/ myocardial rupture), all considered not drug related by the investigator, apart 
from one case of completed suicide considered possibly related; for all the 7 cases of death possible 
confounding factors were in place. 
Other Serious AEs occurred with similar frequencies in short term controlled schizophrenia trials 
between brexpiprazole (3.4%) and placebo (4.2%). The serious TEAEs reported by more than 1 subject 
in the brexpiprazole 2 to 4 mg/day group were predominately in the Psychiatric Disorders SOC, 
including schizophrenia and psychotic disorder.   
A higher frequency of ALT (2.2% vs 1%) and AST increased  ≥3 x ULN (3% vs 0), of TEAEs associated 
with hepatic function (3% vs 0), and of discontinuation due to TEAEs related to hepatic function (1% vs 
0) occured  in brexpiprazole treated subjects compared to PBO in the maintenance phase of long term 
controlled trial 331-10-232. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The only long term controlled safety data come from the 97 brexpiprazole-treated patients within the 
Double-blind Maintenance phase of Trial 331-10-232 comparing brexpiprazole with placebo (n=105), 
administered for up to 52 weeks in subjects who were previously stabilized on brexpiprazole 1 to 4 
mg/day. Thus in the interpretation of the safety data of this long-term controlled pool it must be taken 
in consideration that this is a selected patient population (only patients who tolerated brexpiprazole and 
presented the stability criteria of psychotic symptoms on brexpiprazole 1-4 mg for a consecutive period 
of 12 weeks were randomized in the maintenance period).  Approximately half of the subjects in the 
brexpiprazole group (52%, n=50) completed 24 weeks of therapy during the Double-blind Maintenance 
phase compared with 38% of subjects (n=40) in the placebo group. Few subjects (16 
brexpiprazole-treated subjects and 9 subjects in placebo group) were treated through Week 52 of the 
Double-blind Maintenance phase, due primarily to the early termination of the trial. Most patients 
(63.9%, n=62) received brexpiprazole 4 mg/ day, while 25 patients (25.8%) received brexpiprazole 3 
mg/ day.  
Other long-term safety data come from Open-label Trials in Schizophrenia, where 1426 patients 
received brexpiprazole (all doses). 846 subjects (59.3%) were exposed to ≥ 26 weeks of treatment and 
654 subjects (45.8%) were exposed to ≥ 52 weeks of treatment. The most frequent modal dose was 4 
mg/ day (46%, n= 663), followed by 2 mg/ day (31%, n=442) and 3 mg/ day (20%, n= 279). Other 
safety data come from the US post marketing setting, as brexpiprazole has been approved for 
marketing by the US FDA in July 2015, for the following two indications: adjunctive therapy to 
antidepressants for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment of schizophrenia. 
The schizophrenia patient population included in the safety database is not entirely representative of 
individuals affected by schizophrenia who are the targets of the claimed indication, as elderly subjects, 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 164/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
subjects with psychiatric comorbidities, chronic medical illnesses -including cardiovascular diseases and 
Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus- subjects with substance abuse, hepatic impairment and renal 
impairment have been excluded from clinical trials. Subjects at greatest risk for QT interval 
prolongation were not included in brexpiprazole clinical trials (exclusion criteria: QTcF ≥ 450 ms, only 
few included subjects had >65 years of age). Furthermore, common concomitant medications used in 
schizophrenia were prohibited in the brexpiprazole schizophrenia protocols, thus data regarding 
brexpiprazole use with concomitant medication in the schizophrenia program is limited. 
In light of both non clinical and clinical evidence, the available data do not allow to definitely conclude 
on the relevance of clinical consequences of hyperprolactinaemia long term.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity.  Brexpiprazole is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Only two of the 6 weeks short-term trials included an active controlled arm: Study 14644A, a Phase 3 
flexible dose study, included 153 patients treated with quetiapine XR 400-800 mg and Study 
331-07-203, a fixed-flexible dose, phase 2 study included 50 patients treated with aripiprazole 15±5 
mg. No active comparator is available in long term trials. Compared to the active comparator 
aripiprazole, 2-4 mg brexpiprazole group presented a higher frequency of PCR weight increase (9.1% vs 
4%), PCR prolactin elevations (13.7% vs 0); 4 mg brexpiprazole group presented a higher frequency of 
extrapyramidal symptoms TEAEs (14.3% vs 12.0%) -mostly driven by a higher frequency of akathisia 
events (7.1% vs 4.0%) - and of TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or orthostatic hypotension (3.1% vs 2%). 
The incidence of TEAEs related to somnolence observed with brexpiprazole 2-4 mg was comparable to 
the one observed with aripiprazole (4.5% vs 4.0%). Compared to the active comparator quetiapine, 2-4 
mg brexpiprazole group presented a lower frequency of PCR weight increase (9.1% vs 16.3%), of 
TEAEs of dizziness, syncope or orthostatic hypotension (2.8% vs 14.4%) and of TEAEs related to 
somnolence (4.5% vs 26.1%). Conversely, a higher frequency of PCR prolactin elevations was observed 
with brexpiprazole compared to quetiapine (13.7% vs 8.2%). The highest proposed therapeutic 
brexpiprazole dose (4 mg) presented a higher frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms TEAEs compared 
with quetiapine (14.3% vs 9.2%), mostly driven by a higher frequency of akathisia events (7.1% vs 
3.9%). However, the limited number of patients included in the groups treated with active comparators 
should be taken into account in the interpretation of these data. 
Only 5 subjects aged ≥65 years were included in short term controlled trials. No subject aged ≥63 years 
old was enrolled in the long-term, Controlled Trial 331-10-232. In long term open label trials only 30 
subjects aged ≥65 years old were enrolled. Elderly patients are expected to have a worse safety profile 
with antipsychotics. Per clinical trials inclusion criteria, only patients up to 65 years of age were included 
in clinical trials. Available data do not allow to assess brexpiprazole safety in elderly patients. Elderly 
patients are expected to have a worse safety profile with antipsychotics.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Brexpiprazole demonstrated efficacy as measured by reduction at the PANSS scores from baseline to 
week 6 at the dose of 4 mg (-19.65 points reduction in study 231; -20 points reduction in study 230, 
-11.49 points reduction in the Japanese study) and at the dose of 2 mg (-20.73 points reduction in study 
231; -16.6 points reduction in study 230;-14.95 points reduction in the Japanese study).  
Despite results not being replicated for all dose arms in the development program, a reduction of at 
least 15 points and up to 20 points on average at the PANSS scale is considered clinically relevant. 
Despite initial concerns on the MAR imputation used in the MMRM model for the primary statistical 
analysis, a secondary analysis using a more conservative PMI imputation showed consistent results and 
a similar magnitude of treatment effect for both primary and secondary endpoints. 
In study 14644A the magnitude of treatment effect of quetiapine appeared to be larger than 
brexpiprazole, and this puts the efficacy of brexpiprazole in context even though it is acknowledged that 
the trial is not powered for superiority or head to head comparison. Negative results of study 14644A 
are possibly explained by an unexpectedly high placebo response. The Applicant carried out additional 
analyses of responders which confirmed that both quetiapine and brexpiprazole differentiated from 
placebo, in reducing PANSS scores of ≥30% and ≥ 40% but not ≥50% (neither brexpiprazole nor 
quetiapine achieved 50% PANSS reduction). The change in Personal and Social Performance scale and 
CGI-I were also statistically significant.  
From a safety perspective, brexpiprazole has been investigated comprehensively, however it does not 
present a clear advantage in terms of adverse event profile. Data from clinical studies clearly indicate 
that brexpiprazole treatment is associated with weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms -including 
akathisia, hyperprolactinaemia, CPK increase, dizziness and sedation.  
The Applicant provided a comparison of safety data available for brexpiprazole with data available for 
other antipsychotics, using both data coming from US product labels and published data. Treatment 
with brexpiprazole did not present any novel safety findings compared to other atypical antipsychotics 
indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. From the available data brexpiprazole compared with 
aripiprazole appears to have a lower frequency of sedating AEs and insomnia, a similar frequency of 
akathisia and EPS adverse events and a higher frequency of long term weight gain. A dose-dependency 
was observed in the frequency of akathisia (3.4%, 5.0%, and 7.1%), Parkinsonism and somnolence, as 
expected. No robust direct evidence exists to support any safety advantages of this product compared 
to other similar antipsychotics. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the three fixed-dose placebo-controlled pivotal studies 231, 230, 002 the PANSS score reduction 
compared to placebo was in the range of 15-20 points and above 20, and therefore it was clinically 
relevant. The statistical separation from placebo was not confirmed in two dose arms, however this is a 
common finding in clinical trials for antipsychotics. In study 14644A the magnitude of treatment effect 
of quetiapine appeared to be larger than brexpiprazole and efficacy of RXULTI was not statistically 
significant compared to placebo, however the change from baseline in the PANSS score and the 
EMA/556923/2018  
Page 170/172 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responder analysis confirm a clinically relevant effect also in trial 14644A. Results are consistent across 
sensitivity analyses. 
Like other antipsychotics, brexpiprazole too, has its relatively unique safety profile and no new and 
unexpected safety signals have been identified with brexpiprazole. Also no robust direct evidence exists 
to support any safety advantages of this product compared to other similar antipsychotics. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of RXULTI is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of RXULTI is favourable in the following indication: “RXULTI is indicated for 
the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that brexpiprazole is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
Adalimumab is a recombinant, fully human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that binds 
specifically and with high affinity to the soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α and inhibits the 
binding of TNF-α with its receptors. Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of inflammatory 
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), 
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), plaque psoriasis (Ps), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). 
Problem statement 
In the EU, adalimumab received approval in June 2007 (EMEA/H/C/00481/II/0033) for the treatment 
of severe active CD in patients who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy 
with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant (IMM), or who are intolerant to or have medical 
contraindications for such therapies. Due to the uncertainties about the safety profile of the compound 
and particularly its long-term safety, given the limited safety experience available at that time 
adalimumab was initially approved for the treatment of severe CD only, even though efficacy was 
demonstrated and not questioned in the moderate CD patient population. The objective of the present 
variation is to expand the current indication of adalimumab to patients with moderately active CD who 
have failed conventional therapies. The application is based on additional analyses of clinical data from 
previously performed and assessed studies included in the original application for the CD indication and 
in the CD development programme as well as additional safety data from an ongoing post marketing 
registry in CD. 
Scope of the variation  
In this submission the MAH applied to expand the current indication of adalimumab to adult patients 
with moderately active CD who have failed conventional therapies. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of 
the SmPC have been updated accordingly as well as Annex IIIB.  
The initially applied wording for the extension of indication reads as follows (additions and deletions 
to the existing approved CD indication): 
Crohn’s disease 
Humira is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely, active Crohn’s disease, in adult patients 
who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant; or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies.

At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/63/2011 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Development programme  
The original application for the CD indication, submitted in 2006, included data from the following 5 
clinical studies, which were conducted in subjects with moderately to severely active CD defined by 
Baseline CDAI scores of ≥220 and ≤450:  
 
 
 
two 4-week induction studies, Study M02-403 and Study M04-691; 
one long-term pivotal maintenance study, Study M02-404; 
supportive maintenance study, Study M02-433, with the primary evaluation being maintenance 
through year 1, thereafter long-term extension for patients that completed Study M02-403 
 
subjects who completed Study M04-691 or Study M02-404 could roll over into Study M04-690 
The original application included safety data from Study M02-433 and Study M04-690 through 14 
February 2006. The initial approval of the CD indication was granted for patients with severe disease 
that was defined as a CDAI score >300 in combination with non-response to a full and adequate 
course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant, or for patients who are 
intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. A variation approved in July 2010 
(EMEA/H/C/00481/II/0072) presented data from a sixth study: Study M05-769 investigating the 
effects of adalimumab on mucosal healing; together with final long-term safety and efficacy data from 
Study M04-690 and Study M02-433. 
In addition to the clinical trials, an update of the 6-year registry of CD patients (Study P06-134) is 
submitted to provide additional long-term safety data. It is currently in its fifth year as part of the 
MAH’s postmarketing commitments to the EMA as described in the RMP. This global registry has 
enrolled more than 5,000 CD patients who receive adalimumab in a routine clinical setting under the 
care of gastroenterologists in accordance with local prescribing information. 
Studies M02 403, M04 691, M02 404, M02 433, M04-690, M05-769 have been assessed within 
previous type II applications (procedure EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33: original CD application and procedure 
EMEA/H/C/00481/II/72: update of SmPC related to the CD indication), while interim data from P06-
134 have been assessed annually since 2009 within Follow-Up Measure procedures, as part of the 
ongoing safety follow up. 
Thus, for the present application, the pivotal data come from the registry follow up as well as from the 
full development programme with extension studies of long duration, since those sources provide long-
term safety data from clinical use of adalimumab in patients with moderate CD.

1.2.  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1.  Clinical efficacy 
Analyses across 4 studies are contributing to the demonstration of efficacy (Studies M02-403, M02-
404, M04-691 and M05-769). The new analyses of these 4 studies presented are based on subgroups 
of subjects defined according to CDAI score and IMM use at Baseline. The analyses presented were 
performed to assess the efficacy of adalimumab versus placebo for induction and maintenance of 
clinical remission by disease activity at Baseline (moderate CDAI ≤300 or severe CDAI >300, ranging 
from CDAI 220 to 450) and to compare the efficacy of adalimumab monotherapy versus adalimumab 
plus IMMs or IMM monotherapy. 
1.2.1.1.   
Induction of remission (Studies M02-403 and M04-691) 
Methods 
Efficacy results from the 2 induction studies, Study M02-403 and Study M04-691, were analyzed by 
individual study. The efficacy analyses were conducted on the full analysis sets. The full analysis set 
included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, excluding subjects 
randomized to the adalimumab 40/20 mg treatment group in Study M02-403 because adalimumab 
40/20 mg is not an approved dosing regimen for CD. The full analysis set was analyzed as randomized. 
•  Study participants 
The patients in study M02-403 were anti-TNF naїve while in study M04-691 patients that had 
previously reported intolerance or loss of response to infliximab were included. 
  Statistical methods 
For the analyses by baseline CDAI score, the comparison of the induction of clinical remission between 
adalimumab (80/40 mg and 160/80 mg treatment groups combined in Study M02-403 and 160/80 mg 
treatment group in Study M04-691) and placebo at Week 4 was assessed using chi-square test or 
Fisher's exact test if more than 20% of the cells had an expected cell count <5 for subjects with 
moderately active CD (defined as baseline CDAI ≤300) and severely active CD (defined as baseline 
CDAI >300), separately.  For the analyses by IMM use at Baseline, pairwise comparisons of 
adalimumab monotherapy, adalimumab plus IMMs, and placebo plus IMM (IMM monotherapy) were 
performed using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test if more than 20% of the cells had an expected 
cell count <5. Subjects with a missing CDAI score at Week 4 were classified as "not in clinical 
remission". 
Results 
  Baseline data 
Data from studies M02-403 and M04-691 show that there were no major differences across the groups 
in demographic baseline characteristics apart from a smaller proportion of men in the actively treated 
group with CDAI scores ≤300 as compared to in the group >300 (23% vs. 39%) in study M04-691. 
Patients with moderate disease had lower CRP values as well as CDAI scores at baseline compared to 
patients with more severe disease.

The analyses of the induction study populations by Baseline CDAI score include data from 550 subjects, 
of whom 288 (52.4%) had moderately active CD and 262 (47.6%) had severely active CD. In each 
induction study, the proportion of subjects with clinical remission (CDAI <150) after 4 weeks of 
induction therapy was greater in the adalimumab treatment group compared to the placebo group, 
regardless of disease severity category. 
In Study M02-403, adalimumab (160/80 mg and 80/40 mg regimens combined) was superior to 
placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 4 for those with moderately 
active CD (37.2% versus 17.4%, P = 0.018) and for those with severely active CD (20.0% versus 
3.6%, P = 0.057).

Note: Clinical remission was defined as CDAI score < 150 points. Subjects with missing scores were classified as "no" to clinical 
remission. Adalimumab subjects included subjects in 160/80 mg and 80/40 mg groups combined. P-value is based on chi-square 
test or Fisher's exact test if > 20% of the cells have expected cell count < 5. 
In Study M04-691, adalimumab (160/80 mg regimen) was superior to placebo in the proportion of 
subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 4 for those with moderately active CD (32.0% versus 
9.9%, P <0.001) and for those with severely active CD (11.9% versus 4.7%, P = 0.090)

remission. P-value is based on chi-square test or Fisher's exact test if > 20% of the cells have expected cell count < 5. 
Efficacy results by Baseline IMM Use 
The analyses of the individual induction study populations by Baseline IMM use include a total of 417 
subjects, of whom 107 (25.7%) were treated with IMM monotherapy, 194 (46.5%) were treated with 
adalimumab monotherapy, and 116 (27.8%) were treated with adalimumab plus IMM combination 
therapy.  
Among subjects in Study M02-403 (all naïve), the adalimumab monotherapy treatment group had the 
greatest proportion of subjects with clinical remission at Week 4. Clinical remission was achieved at 
Week 4 by 32.4% of subjects receiving adalimumab monotherapy, 23.3% of those receiving 
adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy, and 9.1% of those receiving IMM monotherapy.

at Baseline of the study. Placebo + IMM use subgroup included placebo subjects who were on IMMs concomitantly at Baseline of the 
study. Immunosuppressants are defined as medications with generic names of azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or methotrexate. 
Among subjects who had previously failed anti-TNF treatment in Study M04-691, clinical remission was 
achieved at Week 4 by 20.9% of subjects receiving adalimumab monotherapy and 21.9% of those 
receiving adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy, compared to 7.1% of those receiving IMM 
monotherapy. Greater percentages of subjects receiving adalimumab (either as monotherapy or in 
combination with IMM) achieved clinical remission at Week 4 compared to subjects receiving IMM 
monotherapy.

1.2.1.2.   
Maintenance of remission (Studies M02-404 and M05-769) 
Methods 
Efficacy results from the 2 maintenance studies, Study M02-404 and Study M05-769, were analyzed 
both individually and pooled. Analyses were performed on the ITT population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of DB study drug, and the mITT population, which 
includes ITT subjects who were Week 4 CR70 responders. 
•  Study participants 
There were both anti-TNF naїve patients and patients who had previously failed anti-TNF agents 
included in studies M02-404 and M05-769. 
•  Statistical methods 
Individual Studies 
For the analysis by Baseline CDAI score, the pairwise comparisons of the maintenance of clinical 
remission (defined as CDAI score <150 points) of adalimumab 40 mg eow, adalimumab 40 mg ew (in 
Study M02-404 only), and placebo at Week 56 (Study M02-404) or Week 52 (Study M05-769) were 
assessed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for previous anti-TNF use in subjects with 
moderately active CD (defined as Baseline CDAI ≤ 300) and severely active CD (defined as Baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 7/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CDAI >300) separately. For the analyses by IMM use at Baseline, the pairwise comparisons of 
adalimumab monotherapy, adalimumab plus IMM, and placebo plus IMM (IMM monotherapy) were 
performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for previous anti-TNF use. Subjects with 
missing CDAI score at Week 56 (Study M02-404) or Week 52 (Study M05-769) or switched to open-
label treatment were classified as "not in clinical remission". 
For the analysis by Baseline CDAI score, the pairwise comparisons of the maintenance of steroid-free 
clinical remission (defined as CDAI score <150 points without steroid use at the visit) of adalimumab 
40 mg eow, adalimumab 40 mg ew (in Study M02-404 only), and placebo at Week 26 and at Week 56 
(Study M02 404) or at Week 28 and at Week 52 (Study M05-769) were also assessed using the 
Fisher's exact test in subjects with moderately and severely active CD, separately. For the analyses by 
IMM use at Baseline, the pairwise comparisons of adalimumab monotherapy, adalimumab plus IMM, 
and placebo plus IMM (IMM monotherapy) were performed using the Fisher's exact test. Subjects with 
missing CDAI score at the visit or at the visit after switched to open-label treatment were classified as 
"not in steroid-free clinical remission". 
Pooled Studies 
Only adalimumab 40 mg eow and placebo treatment groups were common for both Study M02-404 
and Study M05-769 and each of these treatment groups were pooled. Clinical remission at Week 26 
and at Week 56 (Study M02-404) and at Week 28 and at Week 52 (Study M05-769) was combined in 
the pooled analysis. For the analysis by Baseline CDAI score, the comparison of the maintenance of 
clinical remission (defined as CDAI score <150 points) between adalimumab 40 mg eow and placebo at 
Week 26/28 or Week 56/52 was assessed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for previous 
anti-TNF use in subjects with moderately active CD (defined as Baseline CDAI ≤300) and severely 
active CD (defined as Baseline CDAI >300) separately. For the analyses by IMM use at Baseline, the 
pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy, adalimumab plus IMM, and placebo plus IMM (IMM 
monotherapy) were performed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratified for previous anti-TNF 
use. Subjects with missing CDAI score at Week 26/28 or Week 56/52 or switched to open-label 
treatment were classified as "not in clinical remission" (NRI). 
For the analysis by Baseline CDAI score, the comparison of the maintenance of steroid-free clinical 
remission (defined as CDAI score <150 points without steroid use at the visit) between adalimumab 40 
mg eow and placebo at Week 26/28 or Week 56/52 was also assessed using the Fisher's exact test in 
subjects with moderately and severely active CD, separately. For the analyses by IMM use at Baseline, 
the pairwise comparison of adalimumab monotherapy, adalimumab plus IMM, and placebo plus IMM 
(IMM monotherapy) were performed using the Fisher's exact test. Subjects with missing CDAI score at 
the visit or at the visit after switched to open-label treatment were classified as "not in steroid-free 
clinical remission". 
Results  
  Baseline data 
Demographic baseline characteristics were comparable across groups in both studies M02-404 and 
M05-769. Patients with lower CDAI scores also had lower CRP levels. There was a larger proportion of 
patients with CDAI scores >300 in study M02-404 using CD related medication at baseline in 
comparison with patients with less severe disease.

The ITT analyses of the individual maintenance study populations by Baseline CDAI score include a 
total of 907 subjects, of whom 425 (46.9%) had moderately active CD and 482 (53.1%) had severely 
active CD. In each maintenance study, the proportion of subjects with clinical remission (CDAI <150) 
after 1 year of maintenance therapy was greater in the adalimumab treatment group compared to the 
placebo group, regardless of disease severity category. 
In Study M02-404, a greater percentage of mITT subjects in the adalimumab 40 mg eow group had 
clinical remission at Week 56 compared to the placebo group for those with moderately active CD 
(37.7% versus 14.7%, P = 0.001) and for those with severely active CD (34.7% versus 9.5%, 
P<0.001). Findings were similar at Week 56 for steroid-free remission (defined as CDAI <150 without 
steroid use at the visit), which was achieved by statistically significantly more subjects with moderately 
active CD who received adalimumab 40 mg eow compared to placebo (35.1% vs. 14.7%, P = 0.005) 
as well as by subjects with severely active CD who received adalimumab 40 mg eow compared to 
placebo (33.7% versus 7.4%, P <0.001).

Efficacy results by Baseline IMM Use  
The ITT analyses of the individual maintenance study populations by Baseline IMM use include a total 
of 739 subjects (i.e., subjects receiving placebo without IMM use were excluded), of whom 158 (21.4%) 
were treated with IMM monotherapy, 321 (43.4%) were treated with adalimumab monotherapy, and 
260 (35.2%) were treated with adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy. 
In the mITT population from Study M02-404, clinical remission was maintained at Week 56 by 33.7% 
of subjects receiving adalimumab 40 mg eow monotherapy, 39.0% of those receiving adalimumab 40 
mg eow plus IMM combination therapy, and 12.0% of those receiving IMM monotherapy. Similarly, 
steroid-free clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150 without steroid use at the visit) was achieved at 
Week 56 by 31.6% of subjects receiving adalimumab 40 mg eow monotherapy, 37.7% of those 
receiving adalimumab 40 mg eow plus IMM combination therapy, and 10.8% of those receiving IMM 
monotherapy.

subgroup included placebo subjects who were on IMMs concomitantly at Baseline of the study. Immunosuppressants are defined as 
medications with generic names of azathioprine, mercaptopurine, or MTX.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of adalimumab in the induction and maintenance of remission in patients with moderately 
active CD (defined as baseline CDAI scores at baseline ≤300) has been compared with the efficacy in 
patients with severe disease (baseline CDAI scores >300) by subgroup analyses of the data from the 
original CD application and development programme. 
In study M02-403, induction of clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 4 was achieved by a higher 
percentage of subjects treated with adalimumab (160/80 mg and 80/40 mg combined) compared to 
placebo in both moderate and severe CD. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance 
for subjects with severe CD, possibly due to limited sample size. Clinical remission was achieved at 
Week 4 by a greater percentage of subjects receiving adalimumab monotherapy compared to those 
receiving IMM monotherapy. While numerically adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy was 
superior to IMM monotherapy, the difference did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to 
limited sample sizes. The higher reported use of systemic steroids in CDAI ≤300 than in CDAI >300 
population in study M02-403 was discussed. It was clarified that subjects using prednisone or 
equivalent at a dose higher than 20 mg/day were excluded from the study. Patients with higher 
disease activity tend to require higher doses of steroids; therefore such patients were excluded from 
the study, leading to slightly higher enrolment of moderate CD subjects using steroids at permitted 
doses. The difference between the groups did not alter the efficacy or safety conclusions. 
In Study M04-691, adalimumab 160/80 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo in the 
proportion of subjects achieving clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 4 in subjects with moderate 
CD. Although a numerically greater percentage of subjects with severe CD treated with adalimumab 
achieved clinical remission at Week 4 compared to those treated with placebo, this difference did not 
reach statistical significance likely due to limited sample sizes. Greater percentages of subjects 
receiving adalimumab (either as monotherapy or in combination with IMM) achieved clinical remission 
at Week 4 compared to subjects receiving IMM monotherapy. 
In study M02-404, clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Weeks 26 and 56 was achieved by a significantly 
greater percentage of subjects with both moderate and severe CD who received adalimumab treatment 
(adalimumab 40 mg eow or ew) compared to placebo. At both time points, and in both adalimumab 
dosing regimens, clinical remission was achieved by slightly larger proportions of subjects with 
moderate CD compared to subjects with severe CD. No significant differences between adalimumab 
groups were found within moderate or severe CD categories. Efficacy results by baseline CDAI score in 
the ITT analysis set were consistent with those of the mITT analysis set. At Week 26 and at Week 56, 
a greater percentage of subjects who were treated with the adalimumab eow or ew dosing regimens 
with or without IMM therapy (adalimumab monotherapy) and were Week 4 responders (mITT 
population) achieved clinical remission, compared with subjects treated with IMM monotherapy; these 
differences were statistically significant. No significant differences between adalimumab groups were 
found within dosing regimens. Efficacy results by baseline IMM use in the ITT analysis set were 
consistent with those of the mITT analysis set. In the CDAI ≤300 population of study M02-404, the 
apparent higher discontinuation rate in the adalimumab 40 mg eow arm (39%) when compared to the 
other groups (placebo 28% and adalimumab ew 16.5%) was discussed. It was clarified that the 
discontinuation rates of subjects in the adalimumab 40mg eow in CDAI ≤300 population were not 
higher than those reported in the placebo group when only the double blind period of M02-404 study 
was considered and when subjects who were initially randomized to placebo and went on to receive 
open-label adalimumab were excluded (CDAI ≤300 population 37.3% versus placebo 48.3%). 
In study M05-769, at Week 52, a greater percentage of subjects with moderate CD, treated with 
adalimumab, achieved clinical remission (defined as CDAI <150) compared to placebo; however, this 
difference was not statistically significant, likely due to limited sample sizes in the mITT analysis set. A

greater percentage of subjects with severe CD, treated with adalimumab, achieved clinical remission 
compared to subjects with severe CD treated with placebo and the difference was statistically 
significant. Efficacy results by baseline CDAI score in the ITT analysis set are consistent with those of 
the mITT analysis set. A statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with 
adalimumab monotherapy achieved clinical remission at Week 52 compared to subjects treated with 
adalimumab in combination with IMM (IMM monotherapy) in the mITT analysis set. Efficacy results by 
baseline IMM use in the ITT analysis set are consistent with those of the mITT analysis set. During the 
procedure it was clarified that the analyses presented for study M05-769 were only those conducted to 
make the comparison between subjects with moderate CD and those with severe CD. The MAH did not 
present data for the primary endpoint of Study M05-769 (i.e. presence or absence of mucosal 
ulceration at Week 12) since the primary evaluation of efficacy for the present variation was based on 
CDAI clinical remission. The Week 12 endpoint would not have been appropriate to evaluate 
maintenance of clinical remission. The full analysis of this study was submitted previously in the 
procedure EMEA/H/C/481/II/72.  
Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
The submission is based on the re-analysis of 4 clinical studies: studies M02-403, M02-404, M04-691 
and M05-769 previously submitted and assessed by the CHMP. Studies M02 403, M04 691, M02 404, 
M02 433, M04-690, M05-769 have been assessed within previous type II applications (procedures 
EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33: original CD application and EMEA/H/C/00481/II/72: update of SmPC related 
to the CD indication). In the initial approval for the treatment of the active CD patients, the claim to 
include moderate disease in the indication was not accepted because of the limited long-term safety 
experience with adalimumab. With respect to efficacy, the data showed, at the time, a statistically 
significant effect for subjects with moderate CD treated with adalimumab compared to placebo.  
The new analyses presented were performed to assess the efficacy of adalimumab versus placebo for 
induction and maintenance of clinical remission by disease activity at Baseline (moderate CDAI ≤300 
or severe CDAI >300) and to compare the efficacy of adalimumab monotherapy versus adalimumab 
plus IMMs or IMM monotherapy. 
In Study M02-403, induction of clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 4 was achieved by a higher 
percentage of subjects treated with adalimumab (160/80 mg and 80/40 mg combined) compared to 
placebo in both moderate and severe CD. Clinical remission was achieved by larger proportions of 
subjects with moderate CD compared to subjects with severe CD in both treatment groups. Induction 
of clinical remission at Week 4 was achieved by a higher percentage of subjects treated with 
adalimumab monotherapy compared to adalimumab in combination with IMM. Induction treatment 
with adalimumab, either alone or in combination with IMM, yielded a higher percentage of subjects 
achieving clinical remission compared to treatment with placebo in combination with IMM. 
In Study M04-691, induction of clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 4 was achieved by a higher 
percentage of subjects treated with adalimumab 160/80 mg compared to placebo in both moderate 
and severe CD; however, this treatment difference was most pronounced for subjects with moderate 
CD. Induction of clinical remission at Week 4 was achieved by a larger percentage of subjects treated 
with adalimumab, either as monotherapy or combination therapy with IMM, compared to IMM 
monotherapy. 
In Study M02-404, clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Weeks 26 and 56 was achieved by a significantly 
greater percentage of subjects with both moderate and severe CD who received adalimumab treatment 
(adalimumab 40 mg eow or ew) compared to placebo. At both time points, and in both adalimumab 
dosing regimens, clinical remission was achieved by slightly larger proportions of subjects with

moderate CD compared to subjects with severe CD. Clinical remission at Week 26 and at Week 56 was 
achieved by a significantly greater percentage of subjects receiving adalimumab eow or ew, either 
alone or in combination with IMMs, compared to IMM monotherapy. 
In Study M05-769, maintenance of clinical remission (CDAI <150) at Week 52 was achieved by a 
higher percentage of subjects treated with adalimumab 40 mg eow compared to placebo in both 
moderate and severe CD; however, this treatment difference was statistically significant only for 
subjects with severe CD, likely due to the smaller sample size in the moderate group. Maintenance 
treatment with adalimumab, either alone or in combination with IMM, yielded a higher percentage of 
subjects achieving clinical remission at Week 52 compared to treatment with placebo in combination 
with IMM (IMM monotherapy). However, only the difference between adalimumab monotherapy and 
IMM monotherapy reached statistical significance. 
Based on the overall data presented the efficacy of treatment with adalimumab for induction and 
maintenance of remission of active CD is considered comparable in patients with moderate and severe 
disease. Despite some limitations mainly due to the limited number of patients in some subgroup 
analyses, the efficacy data support the extension of adalimumab indication to moderately active 
Crohn’s disease. Overall, the new analyses presented confirm the initial conclusion 
(EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33) that the efficacy of adalimumab treatment in both induction and maintenance 
of remission of active CD is similar in patients with moderately and severely active disease. 
1.2.2.   
Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The analyses presented in this application use data from previously conducted studies to demonstrate 
that the safety profile of adalimumab is similar when comparing patients with moderate CD or severe 
CD to that of placebo. Data were analyzed separately by CDAI score at baseline, with moderately 
active CD (CDAI ≤300) and severely active CD (CDAI >300). Additional analyses were performed to 
compare the safety of adalimumab monotherapy versus adalimumab in combination with IMMs or 
placebo plus IMMs (IMM monotherapy, i.e. conventional therapy). 
The MAH has evaluated data in the following analyses sets: 
-  maintenance controlled DB set with safety data from studies M02-404 and M05-769 
- 
any adalimumab safety analysis set with safety data from all patients receiving at least one dose 
of DB or open label adalimumab in the CD studies M02-403, M04-691, M02-404, M02-433, M04-
690, and M05-769 
- 
data through 01 December 2010 is presented from the CD registry P06-134. An uncontrolled, 
non-interventional registry of CD patients. In parallel to this procedure, data from the registry 
with the cut-off date 01 December 2011 has been submitted as part of the post approval 
commitment to submit annually interim report of the registry (FUM 56.5). For completeness the 
outcome of this report is also reported in this procedure. 
Two pooled analysis sets and 1 individual study analysis set were analyzed. In the maintenance 
controlled DB safety analysis set, the adalimumab 40 mg eow treatment groups and the placebo 
groups from study M02-404 and study M05-769 were combined for safety analyses. In the any 
adalimumab safety analysis set, all subjects receiving at least 1 dose of adalimumab from CD Studies 
M02-403, M02-691, M02-404, M05-769, M02-433, and M04-690 were combined into a single 
treatment group for safety analyses. Data from the CD Registry P06-134 were analyzed separately.

The number of subjects by subgroup is presented in Table 11 for baseline CDAI score and in Table 12 
for baseline IMM use. The CD registry analysis set was not analyzed by baseline CDAI score because 
CDAI score was not collected in the registry. Analyses have been performed in subgroups of regions 
where adalimumab is approved for treatment of severely active CD and for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active CD.

Of the 650 subjects who received at least 1 dose of DB study drug in studies M02-404 and M05-769 
(maintenance controlled DB analysis set), 294 (45.2%) had moderately active CD (CDAI ≤300) and 
356 (54.8%) had severely active CD (CDAI >300). Extent of exposure to adalimumab and placebo was 
comparable between subjects with moderately active CD and those with severely active CD (Table 13). 
In both subgroups, a larger percentage of subjects in the adalimumab treatment group had a full year 
of exposure to treatment compared to the placebo group.

included for patients who participated in a previous CD study and had received Humira in that study. 
The analysis by baseline IMM use revealed that there were no major differences in exposure between 
patients with or without concomitant IMMs although there are more patients included in the registry 
treated with adalimumab monotherapy than adalimumab plus IMMs. 
Adverse events 
Maintenance controlled DB safety analysis set 
Analysis by baseline CDAI Score 
Among subjects with moderately active CD in the maintenance controlled DB analysis set, only 
injection site reactions were reported by a statistically significantly greater proportion of subjects 
treated with adalimumab compared to placebo. The exposure-adjusted event rate of serious infections, 
severe AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) were lower in the adalimumab treatment group 
compared to the placebo group, as was the rate of malignancies. Although the rate of opportunistic 
infections was higher in the adalimumab treatment group compared to the placebo group for subjects 
with moderately active CD, all opportunistic infections reported for subjects with moderately active CD 
were non-serious and non-severe cases of oral candidiasis. The exposure-adjusted event rate for 
serious infections was lower for subjects with moderately active CD compared to those with severely 
active CD and to those in the placebo group.

Analysis by baseline IMM use 
The most common TEAE among patients in the maintenance safety set was CD that was reported by 
17 % of patients with CDAI ≤300 at baseline and by 25% of patients with more severe disease. The 
percentage of subjects in the maintenance controlled DB analysis set who reported AEs was slightly 
higher in the adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy group compared to the adalimumab 
monotherapy and IMM monotherapy groups. However, the exposure-adjusted event rate was higher 
for the IMM monotherapy group compared with the adalimumab monotherapy group and adalimumab 
plus IMM combination therapy groups. The exposure-adjusted event rates of infections and serious 
infections were lower in the adalimumab monotherapy group compared to the IMM monotherapy group, 
whereas exposure-adjusted event rates of infections and serious infections were similar for the IMM 
monotherapy and adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy groups. Opportunistic infections were 
reported at a higher rate in the adalimumab monotherapy group compared to both, the adalimumab 
plus IMM combination therapy group and the IMM monotherapy group; however, all opportunistic 
infections were non-serious and non-severe cases of oral candidiasis. The exposure-adjusted event 
rates for severe AEs and SAEs were also lower in the adalimumab monotherapy group compared to the 
IMM monotherapy group.  Relative to the other 2 groups, the IMM monotherapy group had the lowest 
exposure-adjusted event rate of allergic reaction related AEs and injection site related AEs, and the

highest rate of intestinal obstruction/stricture related AEs. The numbers of AEs at least possibly drug 
related were in general slightly higher in patients on both adalimumab and IMMs while after exposure-
adjustment, at least possibly related AEs dominated in the IMM monotherapy group.

Any adalimumab safety analysis set 
Analysis by baseline CDAI Score 
Among all subjects who received at least 1 dose of adalimumab in the any adalimumab analysis set, 
the percentages reporting any AEs were comparable in the moderate and severe CD subgroups. 
Subjects with moderately active disease had lower exposure-adjusted event rates of SAEs, infections, 
serious infections, opportunistic infections and a similar rate of malignancies compared to those with 
severely active disease. In the any adalimumab safety set the most commonly reported TEAE was 
Crohn’s disease that was reported by 41% and 47% in the groups with baseline CDAI score ≤300 and 
>300, respectively.

Treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with an onset date on or after the first adalimumab 
CD registry study safety analysis set 
From the registry with a cut-off date of up until 01 December 2010, the MAH has performed new 
analyses grouping data from countries where adalimumab is approved for treatment of severe CD only 
and those where adalimumab is approved for treatment of moderately to severely active CD. 
Analysis by marketing approval for moderately active Crohn's Disease 
Adverse events reported in CD Registry P06-134 up until 01 December 2010 were analyzed by region, 
grouping together countries in which adalimumab is approved only for the treatment of severely active 
CD and those in which adalimumab is indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active CD. 
The proportions of subjects reporting AEs are comparable between these 2 groups, as are the 
exposure-adjusted AE event rates. These results indicate that there is no increased risk associated with 
adalimumab when the patient population includes subjects with moderately active CD in addition to 
those with severely active CD.

Table 24 
Overall summary of registry TEAEs of special interest (all treated patients), 
cut off Dec 2011. 
a. Patient years reflect exposure in the registry only, not in the previous studies. 
Note: Data cut-off 01 December 2011. Treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with an 
onset date on or after the first dose of study drug in the registry study and up to 70 days after the last dose of 
study drug if patient discontinued prematurely from the registry or up to 01 December 2011 if patient continues in the 
registry. 
No new safety signals were observed in Registry P06-134 as of the data cut-off date of 01 December 
2011. SAEs were reported during the 4 years of the registry by 25.6 % (1295/5061) of all patients.

The SAEs considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to the adalimumab treatment 
were reported for 5.8 % (296/5061) of patients. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent 
SAEs at least possibly related to adalimumab were Crohn’s disease (n=29), anal abscess (n=18), 
pneumonia (n=12), intestinal obstruction (n=11), cellulitis (n=9), abdominal abscess (n=8), sepsis 
(n=7), small intestinal obstruction (n=7), anal fistula (n=6), herpes zoster (n=6), ileal stenosis (n=6), 
and staphylococcal infection (n=6). All other events were reported by 4 or fewer patients. Twenty 
deaths occurred during the period and an additional 6 patients died post-treatment. Events of special 
interest were identified using search criteria for the first 4 years of this registry and are summarized as 
follows: 
-  Serious opportunistic infections (excluding TB) were reported in 5 patients (<0.1 %), with 4 
patients reporting events that were considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per the 
physician. Ten cases of TB were reported. 
- 
Lymphoma was reported in 5 patients (<0.1%), leukaemia in 3 patients (<0.1%), and NMSC in 17 
patients (0.3%). Two events of lymphoma, 3 events of leukaemia, and 10 events of NMSC were 
considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
-  Other malignancies were reported in 39 patients (0.8 %), with 15 patients reporting events that 
were considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
- 
Immune reactions including lupus and lupus-like syndrome were reported in 15 patients (0.3%), 
with 13 patients reporting events that were considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per 
the physician. A serious allergic reaction was reported in 2 patients (<0.1 %), with both events 
being considered probably not related to adalimumab by the physician. 
-  Congestive Heart Failure was reported in 2 patients (<0.1 %) and was considered by the physician 
not related to adalimumab. 
-  Cerebrovascular accidents were reported in 6 patients (<0.1 %), with 2 events being considered at 
least possibly related to adalimumab by the physician. 
-  Myocardial infarction was reported in 4 patients (<0.1 %), with neither of the patients having 
events that were considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
-  Demyelinating disease was reported in 4 patients (<0.1 %), with all events considered by the 
physician to be at least possibly related to adalimumab. 
-  Serious hepatic events or hepatic events that led to study discontinuation were reported in 7 
patients (0.1 %). All these events were considered probably not related to adalimumab. 
-  Serious hematologic events or hematologic events that resulted in discontinuation were reported in 
25 patients (0.5 %). Events in 3 patients were considered at least possibly related to adalimumab 
per the physician. 
-  Worsening or new occurrence of psoriasis was reported in 31 patients (0.6 %), with events in all 
but 2 patients considered at least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
-  Vasculitis was reported in 4 patients (<0.1 %), with 3 events considered at least possibly related 
to adalimumab per the physician. 
-  Diverticulitis was reported in 3 patients (<0.1 %), with 1 event considered possibly related to 
adalimumab per the physician. 
- 
Intestinal perforation was reported in 18 patients (0.4 %). Two of these events were considered at 
least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 25/34
 
 
 
 
- 
Intestinal obstruction was reported in 316 patients (6.2 %); 33 of these events were considered at 
least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
- 
Pancreatitis was reported in 11 patients (0.2 %); events in 3 patients were considered at least 
possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
- 
Interstitial lung disease was reported in 3 patients (<0.1 %). Events in 2 patients were considered 
at least possibly related to adalimumab per the physician. 
-  AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported in 327 patients (6.5%). 
Events in 143 patients were considered possibly or probably related to adalimumab by the 
physician. 
Based on these results the CHMP concluded in FUM 056.5 that no new clinical concerns were 
established with regard to the incidence of deaths, SAEs, or AEs of special interest and no new safety 
signals were observed. The analysis of the incidence of serious infections in patients receiving 
adalimumab monotherapy versus patients receiving adalimumab plus immunomodulators is consistent 
with previous observations. 
Supportive safety data from a US claims database study 
Additional support for the safety profile of adalimumab compared to IMMs comes from an analysis of 
health care claims data, in which patients aged 18 to 64 were classified into treatment cohorts based 
on initiation of adalimumab or IMMs between 01 July 2000 and 31 December 2010 following diagnosis 
of CD. This study examined the time to development of infection and malignancy, as well as the time 
to hospitalization or emergency room (ER) visits (all-cause and specific disease-related) in CD patients 
using health care claims data. The effect of CD treatment on developing these adverse events was 
investigated by comparing patients treated with adalimumab monotherapy with patients treated with 
immunosuppressants. 
The database contains medical claims for inpatient, outpatient, emergency department care, 
prescription drug claims, health coverage eligibility and demographic information. Patients were first 
classified into treatment cohorts based on initiation of adalimumab following CD diagnosis. Remaining 
patients using immunosuppressants following a CD diagnosis were classified into the 
immunosuppressant cohort. Patients who used adalimumab and immunosuppressants concomitantly, 
defined as a prescription fill for an immunosuppressant that overlaps with the adalimumab index 
prescription, were excluded from this analysis. 
Overall, there were 9511 patients with CD that fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Of those, 2195 patients 
initiated adalimumab monotherapy and 6477 patients initiated IMM treatment. An additional 839 
patients concomitantly used adalimumab and IMMs.

Table 25  
Sample selection in the HEOR analysis report 
a. Patients were required to have at least 2 CD diagnoses (ICD-9-CM 555.x) on different days. 
b. Patients were excluded if they had more than 1 diagnosis for UC (ICD-9-CM 556.x) in the 6 months before their  
first CD diagnosis date and if they had 1 or more diagnoses for UC at any point after their second CD diagnosis date. 
c. Patients were first classified into treatment cohorts based on initiation of adalimumab following CD diagnosis. 
Remaining patients using immunosuppressants following CD diagnosis were classified into the immunosuppressant  
therapy cohort. The index date was defined as the date of first adalimumab or immunosuppressant use following first 
CD diagnosis. 
d. Concomitant use of adalimumab and immunosuppressants was defined as a prescription fill for an immunosuppressant 
that overlaps with the adalimumab index prescription. If a patient concomitantly initiated adalimumab and  
immunosuppressants, then this patient was defined as a concomitant (C) therapy patient. Otherwise, if the patient 
initiated only adalimumab, then this patient was defined as an adalimumab monotherapy (A) patient. Patients receiving 
adalimumab monotherapy may have use of immunosuppressants after the end of the index adalimumab prescription. 
e. Use of another anti-TNF therapy during the follow-up period is defined as a prescription fill for an anti-TNF that 
overlaps with the adalimumab index date or an anti-TNF prescription fill any time after the adalimumab index date. 
f. Patients were followed until the end of eligibility. 
Data could not be adjusted for disease severity but was controlled for baseline co-morbidities that were 
significantly different between the treatment groups and had >5% prevalence in at least one of the 
groups, as well as for baseline prescription medication use, which serves as a measure of baseline 
disease severity. The longest follow-up was 2799 days for adalimumab and 3739 days for IMMs 
patients, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to control for patients' age, gender, 
major comorbidities and months from diagnosis date to index date (treatment pattern). 
After adjustment, observed differences in the initial Kaplan-Meier analysis concerning risk for patients 
receiving adalimumab or IMM monotherapy for being hospitalized/visiting the ER for infection, was not 
statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.148; 95% CI: 0.886 – 1.486;P = 0.297). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 27/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
With similar adjustment for difference in baseline characteristics using Cox model, patients receiving 
adalimumab monotherapy had similar risk of malignancy compared to patients treated with IMMs 
(hazard ratio = 0.923; 95% CI: 0.668 – 1.275; P = 0.626). 
Patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy were estimated to have similar risk for being 
hospitalized/visiting the ER for malignancy compared to patients treated with IMMs (hazard ratio = 
0.527; 95% CI: 0.208 – 1.337; P = 0.177). The risk for malignancy or hospitalization/ER visit for 
infection was also estimated to be similar (hazard ratio = 1.089; 95% CI: 0.876 – 1.353; P = 0.444). 
Corresponding figures for all-cause hospitalization/ER visit were, hazard ratio = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.919 – 
1.106; P = 0.865, and risk for all-cause hospitalization, hazard ratio = 0.940; 95% CI: 0.836 – 1.057; 
P = 0.299, respectively. 
The analysis of the study data did not reveal any differences in developing malignancy, having a 
hospitalization/ ER visit for malignancy, developing malignancy or having a hospitalization/ER visit for 
infection, or having a hospitalization/ER visit due to any cause for CD patients receiving adalimumab 
monotherapy compared with CD patients treated with IMMs. 
Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
There were no significant differences in the presented studies between patients with moderate and 
severe disease in numbers of serious AEs.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory parameters, vital signs, and ECG data collected during the studies were not re-analyzed for 
this variation, which is acceptable. 
1.2.2.1.   Discussion on clinical safety 
To support that the safety profile of adalimumab in the treatment of CD is acceptable to justify 
widening the indication to use in patients with moderately active disease, the MAH has provided 
various analyses in subgroups of patients with moderately or severely active disease, as well as for 
those with or without IMM at baseline.   
- Analysis by disease severity 
Among subjects with moderately active CD in maintenance studies M02-404 and M05-769 
(maintenance controlled DB analysis set), exposure-adjusted event rates were lower in the 
adalimumab 40 mg eow treatment group than in the placebo treatment group for any AEs (864.9 
versus 988.9 events/100 patient-years [PYs]), at least possibly related AEs (245.6 versus 262.5 
events/100 PYs), severe AEs (48.2 versus 77.6 events/100 PYs), SAEs (22.3 versus 35.1 events/100 
PYs), infections (181.0 versus 194.1 events/100 PYs), serious infections (2.4 versus 5.5 events/100 
PYs), and malignancies (0 versus 1.8 events/100 PYs) during DB treatment. Opportunistic infections 
(excluding tuberculosis) were reported at a higher frequency among adalimumab-treated subjects 
compared to placebo-treated subjects with moderately active CD (5.9 versus 1.8 events/100 PYs); 
however, all infections categorized as opportunistic were non-severe, non-serious events of oral 
candidiasis/fungal infection. In the maintenance controlled DB safety set, the proportion of patients 
with AEs in the two adalimumab treatment groups (CDAI score higher or lower than 300) was in 
general of similar magnitude apart from AEs at least possibly drug related and injection site related 
AEs that were more frequently reported in the group with baseline CDAI score ≤300. This was also 
reflected in the exposure-adjusted analysis. Overall, the safety profile for patients with baseline scores 
of less severe disease is comparable with the safety profile for patients with severely active CD. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 28/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
In any of the CD studies (any adalimumab analysis set), in general, there was no difference between 
subgroups with moderate and severe disease respectively, although a slightly higher number of events 
were reported in the severe group. Exposure-adjusted event rates were lower or similar for those with 
moderately active disease compared to those with severely active disease for SAEs (23.8 versus 35.6 
events/100 PYs), infections (113.3 versus 131.1 events/100 PYs), serious infections (4.0 versus 7.1 
events/100 PYs), opportunistic infections excluding TB (1.3 versus 1.9 events/100 PYs), and 
malignancies (1.8 versus 1.2 events/100 PYs for all malignancies and 0.2 versus 0 events/100 PYs for 
lymphoma).  
- Analysis by baseline IMM use 
In the maintenance controlled DB analysis set treatment with IMM monotherapy was associated with a 
higher overall exposure-adjusted incidence of AEs compared with adalimumab monotherapy or 
adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy. Exposure-adjusted rates of infections and serious 
infections were similar for the IMM monotherapy and adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy 
groups; by comparison, the rates of infections and serious infections in the adalimumab monotherapy 
group were lower. Opportunistic infections excluding TB were reported more frequently in the 
adalimumab monotherapy group and adalimumab plus IMM combination therapy group compared to 
the IMM monotherapy group; however, all opportunistic infections were non-severe, non-serious 
events of oral candidiasis/fungal infection. 
In the any adalimumab analysis set, the exposure-adjusted event rates were higher in the IMM 
combination therapy group compared to the adalimumab monotherapy group for SAEs (34.3 versus 
25.4 events/100 PYs), serious infections (6.7 versus 4.5 events/100 PYs), opportunistic infections 
excluding TB (1.8 versus 1.4 events/100 PYs), and malignancies (2.3 versus 0.8 events/100 PYs). 
Overall, comparison of the safety between patients on adalimumab monotherapy and those given 
adalimumab or placebo plus IMM treatment at baseline showed a higher adverse event rate in the 
placebo with IMM baseline therapy subgroup in the maintenance controlled DB analysis. In the any 
adalimumab analysis set higher incidences of malignant and serious infection-related adverse events 
were seen with the combination of adalimumab and azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine compared with 
adalimumab alone. 
- CD registry Study P06-134 
Concerning the CD registry safety set, SAEs and AEs of interest were analysed. Adverse events of 
interest include serious opportunistic infections (including TB), occurrence of symptomatic intestinal 
obstruction, lymphoma including hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma; leukaemia and non-melanoma skin 
cancer (NMSC), other malignancies (except lymphoma, leukaemia, and NMSC), lupus/lupus-like illness, 
demyelinating disorders, and congestive heart failure. 
In this ongoing CD registry, analysis by CDAI was not possible as CDAI score is not available for these 
patients. Adverse events reported in the CD registry through 01 December 2010 were analyzed by 
region, grouping together participating countries in which adalimumab is approved only for the 
treatment of severely active CD and those in which adalimumab is indicated for the treatment of 
moderately to severely active CD. The exposure-adjusted event rates were comparable between these 
2 groups. There was no increased risk associated with adalimumab when the patient population 
includes subjects with moderately to severely active CD compared to the patient population that 
includes subjects with severely active CD only. In the analysis by baseline IMM use, the exposure-
adjusted AE rates were comparable for subjects receiving adalimumab with IMMs and those receiving 
adalimumab without concomitant IMM use, including serious opportunistic infections excluding TB (<

0.1 events/100 PYs in both groups). Among the events recorded, there are no new safety signals that 
have been identified. The events observed are as expected based on clinical trials experience and in 
line with known class effects for anti-TNF agents and with what is reflected in the adalimumab product 
information.  
A most recent data set of the CD registry (cut-off December 2011) has been assessed within FUM 
056.5 and overall the results presented confirmed the well characterised safety profile of adalimumab 
and no new safety issue was identified. Concerning this FUM the CHMP concluded in March 2012: 
“…Currently, exposure up to 1 year is relatively large with 4082 patients and up to 2 years 3474 
patients. This corresponds to 10,579 patient’s years. … Among the events recorded, there are no new 
safety signals that have been identified. For hepatic events, the MAH states that those being serious or 
leading to discontinuation were probably not related. However, for certain of these events, a 
relationship to adalimumab cannot be excluded. There are two ongoing variations 
(EMEA/H/C/481/II/92 and EMEA/H/C/481/II/93) addressing serious hepatic events and autoimmune 
hepatitis, and the PI will be updated. Overall, the events observed are as expected based on the 
clinical trials experience and in line with known class effects for an anti-TNF agent and with what is 
reflected in the product information. With continued data collection, this data source will become even 
more valuable to assess long-term effects of adalimumab in Crohn’s disease”.  
- US claims database study 
The supportive data from the US claims database did not reveal any differences in developing 
malignancy, having a hospitalization/ ER visit for malignancy, developing malignancy or having a 
hospitalization/ER visit for infection, or having a hospitalization/ER visit due to any cause for CD 
patients receiving adalimumab monotherapy compared with CD patients treated with IMMs. 
1.2.2.2.   Conclusion on clinical safety  
Based on the re-analysis presented from previous submitted studies, the safety profile for patients with 
moderate disease is comparable with the safety profile for patients with severely active CD. In general, 
it appears that the safety profile for patients with less severe disease is related to a lower rate of AEs. 
Furthermore, percentage of subjects who reported any AE was similar for adalimumab-treated subjects 
without concomitant IMMs versus with concomitant IMMs. The exposure-adjusted incidences of serious 
infections and malignancies were higher for the IMM combination therapy group compared to 
adalimumab monotherapy. This was reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Long term safety data from the CD registry P06-134 showed that the exposure-adjusted incidence of 
AEs was comparable for subjects receiving adalimumab with IMMs and those receiving adalimumab 
without concomitant IMM use. There was no increased risk associated with adalimumab when the 
patient population includes subjects with moderately to severely active CD compared to the population 
that includes subjects with severely active CD only. No direct study comparisons with IMM or 
corticosteroids were available. As indicated from the US claims database, the safety profile of 
adalimumab as compared with IMM appears comparable in CD patients concerning the risk of 
developing malignancy, having a hospitalization/ ER visit for malignancy, developing malignancy or 
having a hospitalization/ER visit for infection, or having a hospitalization/ER visit due to any cause. 
In the initial CD application (EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33) the CHMP concluded that: The safety profile 
observed in the CD studies seemed to correspond to the earlier known safety profile of anti-TNFα drugs 
with increased risk for infections, including opportunistic infections. Furthermore, uncertainties related 
to long-term effects remain. Therefore, the CHMP did not agree with the inclusion of moderate disease 
in the indication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 30/34
 
 
 
 
 
The current safety experience with adalimumab, including long-term safety, is extensive and the safety 
profile is now well characterised. It is characterised by the risk for injection site reactions, infections, 
including serious infections, risk for malignancy including rare event of HSTCL, as well as other events 
including demyelination, psoriasis etc. Those risks warranted a structured post marketing follow up 
progressively put in place over the years as well as adequate risk minimisation activities, which are in 
place already. 
No new safety signal was identified from the re-analysis presented as well as from the registry data. 
The events observed were as expected based on the clinical trials and extensive postmarketing 
experience. Overall, these events are already reflected in the product information and addressed in the 
RMP when appropriate. 
In conclusion, the data presented show that the safety profile in patients with moderate CD is similar 
to that in patients with severe CD. Data submitted in this application confirm the known safety profile 
observed with the approved indications. The extensive knowledge gained particularly in terms of long-
term data, is deemed sufficient to now broaden the patient population to subjects with moderate CD. 
1.2.2.3.   Risk Management plan 
Version 9.2.2.1 of the Humira Risk Management Plan (RMP) received a CHMP positive opinion in June 
2012 (EMEA/H/C/481/II/85). This version of the RMP already covers a moderate-to-severe CD 
population. As no new safety issue has been identified in the data presented for this application, no 
update to the currently approved RMP is considered necessary for the moderate CD population. 
2.  Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The characterization of beneficial effects is based on the re-analysis of 4 clinical studies: studies M02-
403, M02-404, M04-691 and M05-769 previously submitted and assessed by the CHMP within previous 
type II applications (procedures EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33: original CD indication application and 
EMEA/H/C/00481/II/72: update of SmPC related to the CD indication). In the initial approval for the 
treatment of the active CD patients, the claim to include moderate disease in the indication was not 
accepted because of the limited long-term safety experience with adalimumab. With respect to efficacy, 
the data showed, at the time, a statistically significant effect for subjects with moderate CD treated 
with adalimumab compared to placebo. The new analyses presented were performed to assess the 
efficacy of adalimumab versus placebo for induction and maintenance of clinical remission by disease 
activity at Baseline (moderate CDAI ≤300 or severe CDAI >300) and to compare the efficacy of 
adalimumab monotherapy versus adalimumab plus IMMs or IMM monotherapy. The overall data 
presented showed that the efficacy of treatment with adalimumab for induction and maintenance of 
remission of active CD is comparable in patients with moderate and severe Crohn’s disease. 
Acknowledging some limitations mainly due to the limited number of patients in some subgroup 
analyses, the efficacy data support the extension of adalimumab indication to moderately active 
Crohn’s disease. The new analyses presented confirm the initial conclusions 
(EMEA/H/C/000481/II/0033) that the efficacy of adalimumab treatment is demonstrated for the 
induction and maintenance of remission of active CD in patients with moderately and severely active 
disease. Overall, taking together data from the initial CD application and data from this re-analysis, the 
efficacy of adalimumab treatment in moderate disease is considered sufficiently demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/609117/2012  
Page 31/34
 
 
 
 
 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In terms of long-term beneficial effect of adalimumab used in earlier stages of Crohn’s disease, it is 
generally uncertain whether early introduction of the treatment may induce a more sustained long-
term effect (e.g. reduced need for surgery) and if the treatment may affect the natural course of the 
disease. However, it is considered only feasible to address this in long-term observations. Surgery 
reports will continue to be followed in the ongoing CD registry as described in the RMP. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Data from the submitted analyses of the CD studies (1594 patients exposed) indicate that the safety 
profile for patients with moderate CD is comparable with the safety profile for patients with severely 
active CD. From the CD registry P06-134, with total exposure to adalimumab of 10,579 patient years, 
the incidence of AEs was comparable for subjects receiving adalimumab with IMMs and those receiving 
adalimumab without concomitant IMM use. There was no increased risk associated with adalimumab 
when the patient population includes subjects with moderately to severely active CD compared to the 
population that includes subjects with severely active CD only. No new safety signal was indentified 
from the re-analysis presented as well as from the registry data presenting extensive long term safety 
data. The events observed were as expected based on the clinical trials knowledge and extensive 
postmarketing experience. Overall, these events are already reflected in the product information and 
addressed in the RMP when appropriate.  
Overall, taken together, the now available extensive experience on the long term safety in patients 
with moderate CD is considered sufficient to demonstrate that the safety profile is consistent with the 
known safety profile of adalimumab in patients with severely active CD as well as the one known for 
other approved indications. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are limited data from direct comparisons of the safety profile of traditional therapies and 
adalimumab. Standard treatment options are also associated with risks for serious adverse events. 
Analysis of subgroups of patients with or without IMM at baseline showed, in the maintenance 
controlled DB analysis, a higher adverse event rate in the IMM monotherapy subgroup. However, in the 
any adalimumab set there appear to be higher incidences of serious infections and malignancies in the 
IMM combination therapy group compared to adalimumab monotherapy. This information has been 
reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Serious infections and malignancies are known risks with 
adalimumab use, as they are with IMMs. They are addressed in the SmPC as well as in the RMP 
including ongoing monitoring through long-term clinical studies and registries as well as through 
additional risk minimisation activities in the form of an educational program. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
There is a need for alternative therapies in moderate Crohn’s disease not adequately responsive 
despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an immunosuppressant, or in 
subjects who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. The efficacy results 
show that adalimumab is efficacious in moderately active CD, not adequately responsive or intolerant

to standard treatment with IMM and corticosteroids. Maintenance of clinical response is a main 
component of the efficacy profile of a product aimed at the treatment of CD. The demonstrated 
positive beneficial effect of adalimumab in the maintenance setting of moderately active CD 
significantly supports the clinical benefit of adalimumab in the sought indication.  
The safety profile of adalimumab is adequately characterised and no new treatment-related AE or 
safety signal was identified from the extensive long term data submitted. Data from the 4 year interim 
summary of safety registry P06-134 supports the known safety profile of adalimumab. It is noted that 
serious infections and malignancies are known to occur with adalimumab treatment and should be 
taken into account especially in subjects treated with concomitant IMM.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The demonstration of efficacy in this application is supported by the re-analysis of 4 clinical studies: 
studies M02-403, M02-404, M04-691 and M05-769 previously assessed by the CHMP through 
procedures EMEA/H/C/00481/II/33: original CD application and EMEA/H/C/00481/II/72: update of 
SmPC related to the CD indication. In the initial approval for the treatment of the active CD patients, 
the claim to include moderate disease in the indication was not accepted because of the limited long-
term safety experience with adalimumab. With respect to efficacy, the data showed, at the time, a 
statistically significant effect for subjects with moderate CD treated with adalimumab compared to 
placebo. Adalimumab treatment has been shown to be effective in patients with both moderate and 
severe active Crohn’s disease. The new analyses presented confirmed this conclusion on a 
demonstrated efficacy of adalimumab in patients with moderate CD.  
The main focus for this assessment therefore concerns whether the long term safety profile for 
adalimumab in the treatment of patients with moderate CD is acceptable to justify widening the 
indication to use in patients with also moderately active disease, who have inadequate response to 
conventional therapies. In support, the MAH has provided various new safety analyses in subgroups of 
patients with moderately or severely active disease, as well as for those with or without IMM at 
baseline from the complete CD development programme. In addition data from the ongoing CD 
registry P06-134, comprising more than 10, 000 patient years of exposure, has been presented. 
Data showed that the safety profile for patients with moderate CD is comparable with the safety profile 
for patients with severely active CD. Data in a sub-group analysis showed that there appear to be 
higher incidences of serious infections and malignancies in the IMM combination therapy group 
compared to adalimumab monotherapy. This information was reflected in the SmPC to inform 
physicians on this potential risk in case of combination therapy. From the CD registry the incidence of 
AEs was comparable for subjects receiving adalimumab with IMMs and those receiving adalimumab 
monotherapy. There was no increased risk associated with adalimumab when the patient population 
includes subjects with moderately to severely active CD compared to the population that includes 
subjects with severely active CD only. No new safety signal was identified. The safety profile of 
adalimumab in the treatment of patients with moderate CD appears comparable to the one observed in 
the severe CD population and also consistent with the well-characterised adalimumab safety profile 
across all approved indications. 
Overall, the current extensive adalimumab safety experience from the complete CD development 
programme and the ongoing CD registry as well as the extensive safety postmarketing experience 
across other approved indications, provide sufficient evidence on the safety information to conclude 
that no emerging safety issue is associated with adalimumab when used to treat patients with 
moderate CD and that its safety profile in this indication is consistent with the well-characterised

adalimumab safety profile. The extensive knowledge gathered particularly in terms of long-term data, 
is deemed sufficient to now broaden the patient population to subjects with moderate CD. 
In conclusion, based on the available efficacy and safety data presented, the benefit risk balance of 
adalimumab is considered positive for the treatment of patients with moderately active Crohn’s disease 
who have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with corticosteroid and/or IMMs 
or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such therapies. 
3.  Conclusion 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore does recommend, by consensus, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6 Change(s) to 
Addition of a new therapeutic indication or modification of 
II 
therapeutic indication(s) 
an approved one. 
Extension of indication for the treatment of adult patients with moderately active Crohn's disease who 
have not responded despite a full and adequate course of therapy with a corticosteroid and/or an 
immunosuppressant. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated accordingly as 
well as the package leaflet.

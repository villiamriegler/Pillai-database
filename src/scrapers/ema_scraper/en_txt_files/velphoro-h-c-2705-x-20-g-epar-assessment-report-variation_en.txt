Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma France submitted on 20 August 2019 a group of 
variation(s) consisting of extensions of the marketing authorisation and the following variation: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for an addition of a new pharmaceutical form with a new strength -powder for oral 
suspension 125 mg. 
In addition, the MAH proposed an extension of indication to add an indication to use Velphoro for the 
control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age and older with CKD stages 4-
5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with CKD on dialysis, based on the 
results from an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, parallel group, multicentre, phase 3 study 
investigating the safety and efficacy of Velphoro and calcium acetate in paediatric and adolescent 
CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia (Study PA-CL-PED-01). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 
4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The RMP version 7.0 has also been submitted. The Package 
Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Furthermore, the list of local representatives was updated, and the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (2) points (c) and (d) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
And Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0196/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0196/2018 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0196/2018. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

explanation before the CHMP during the meeting on 
The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific 
discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
a marketing authorisation to Velphoro on  
17 September 2020 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Within this procedure, the MAH proposes the following new additional therapeutic indication:   
“Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with 
CKD on dialysis.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Hyperphosphataemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
Hyperphosphataemia is a common and serious complication in patients with CKD, particularly those 
with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, and it occurs in over 70% of ESRD patients. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Hyperphosphatemia plays an important role in the pathophysiology of major CKD complications, such 
as secondary hyperparathyroidism, mineral and bone disorder (MBD) and cardiovascular disease. 
Complications most relevant to the paediatric population are renal bone disease, cardiovascular 
disease and growth failure. High serum phosphorus levels are considered a risk factor for mortality, 
morbidity and hospitalisation in patients with ESRD. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
See chapter above. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Transplantation is the preferred treatment for ESRD in the paediatric population, and dialysis is used 
for the relatively limited period while awaiting a transplant, or in patients not qualifying for renal 
transplantation. However, the waiting period before transplantation is variable. Kovalski et al., 2007 
reported that more than 75% of children require chronic dialysis while awaiting transplantation, with 
waiting periods varying between a few months and several years. Hyperphosphatemia cannot be 
satisfactorily controlled by dietary restriction alone in these patients. Protein restriction is not effective 
in slowing the progression of CKD in children and is generally not recommended due to the possibility 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 8/84 
 
 
 
 
 
of adverse effects on growth and development. In addition, dialysis is not particularly effective in 
removing phosphate, as phosphates are mainly stored intracellularly after gastrointestinal (GI) 
absorption; hence, it is necessary to employ therapeutic means of binding phosphate to reduce dietary 
uptake.  
For adults, several phosphate binders are currently available for treating hyperphosphatemia with CKD 
and on dialysis (haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD)). Calcium salts are widely used, but their 
use is limited by the development of hypercalcaemia, which has been reported to occur in over 50% of 
CKD patients on HD. Furthermore, calcium salts exacerbate hypercalcaemia caused by resorption of 
calcium from the bones, particularly in patients receiving active Vitamin D metabolites (which increase 
intestinal calcium absorption) or when bone turnover is low. Together with raised phosphorus levels, 
this may contribute to vascular calcification and arterial and coronary sclerosis. For this reason, it has 
been suggested that calcium-based phosphate binders should be avoided in many, if not most, adult 
patients undergoing dialysis. Use of calcium salts may also result in over-suppression of parathyroid 
hormone. Aluminium salts are rarely used today and are associated with toxicity related to aluminium 
absorption which may lead to Vitamin D-resistant osteomalacia and neurological problems such as 
encephalopathy and dementia. Newer phosphate binder products include sevelamer hydrochloride, 
sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate. Sevelamer is a non-absorbable, cationic polymer 
capable of reversibly binding anions such as phosphate. It is effective in reducing phosphorus levels, 
but has a relatively high pill burden, requires swallowing of large tablets without chewing. Lanthanum 
carbonate appears to be well tolerated and has a reduced pill burden compared to sevelamer. 
In children, the use of phosphate binders for treatment of hyperphosphatemia with advanced CKD is 
widespread, but not all of these substances are approved in this population. To date, only sevelamer 
powder for oral suspension is approved for children >6 years of age. The National Kidney Foundation 
(NKF) (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD-MBD Guidelines and Kidney Disease 
Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Guidelines) and the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical 
Excellence recommend the use of phosphate binders in children. Calcium-based phosphate binders are 
recommended by these guidelines as the first choice, in addition to dietary management. Hence, 
although used off-label, with these medicinal products, is most experience in children in clinical 
practice. Their use is, however, associated with the risk of hypercalcaemia.  
About the product 
Velphoro contains sucroferric oxyhydroxide, also known as, PA21 or a mixture of polynuclear iron (III)-
oxyhydroxide (pn-FeOOH), sucrose and starches. It is an iron-based phosphate binder for oral 
administration. Phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and/or 
water and the phosphate ions throughout the physiological pH range of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Serum phosphorus levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. 
Velphoro is currently approved as 500 mg chewable tablets for use in adults only. The MAH, Vifor 
Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma France (VFMCRP), submitted a grouped extension/ type II 
variation application for authorisation of a new pharmaceutical form of a powder for oral suspension 
with a new strength 125 mg for a separate indication in the paediatric population from 2 years of age 
with CKD with hyperphosphatemia. 
Therefore, the MAH provided results of a quality-related study for the development of the powder for 
oral suspension and results of study PA-CL-PED-01, which is an open-label, randomised, multicentre, 
active-controlled parallel group trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of PA21 in children from birth to 
less than 18 years of age with hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease, with a 24-week open-
label extension to evaluate safety. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 9/84 
 
 
 
Based on these study data, the MAH applies/requests for the authorization of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a new pharmaceutical form of an oral powder suspension associated with a new strength 125 mg, 
for a separate indication in paediatric CKD patients aged 2 years and older with 
hyperphosphataemia, 
an update of the SmPC for the existing 500 mg chewable tablets with the paediatric indication, 
consequential changes to SmPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 and patient leaflet and an updated 
version of the RMP 7.0, and 
an extended marketing protection period for a new indication of significant clinical benefit in 
comparison to existing therapies. 
The current therapeutic indication is:  
“Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Velphoro should be used within the context 
of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin 
D3 or one of its analogues, or calcimimetics to control the development of renal bone disease.” 
Velphoro is currently only indicated in adult patients. The safety and efficacy of Velphoro in children 
and adolescents below the age of 18 years has not yet been established. No data were available. 
Within this procedure, the MAH proposes the following new additional therapeutic indication:   
“Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with 
CKD on dialysis.” 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
 Scientific advice 
No scientific advice with regard to the proposed paediatric indication has been requested.  
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
Within this application, the MAH submits final results for an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
for Velphoro® (PA21), EMA PIP number EMEA-001061-PIP01-10-M03, as approved on 17 July 2018 
(EMA decision P/0196/2018) and requests verification of compliance with the agreed PIP as a part of 
the validation of this line extension application.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The present application concerns a line-extension of the already authorised product Velphoro 500 mg, 
chewable tablets using the same active substance. The MAH applied for the addition of a new 
pharmaceutical form with a new strength -oral powder in sachet 125 mg for paediatric patients. 
The finished product is presented as an oral powder in sachet containing 125 mg iron (as sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide also known as a mixture of polynuclear iron (III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose, and starches 
(potato starch and pregelatinized maize starch)) as active substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 10/84 
 
 
 
Other ingredients are: maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose, xanthan gum, colloidal anhydrous silica 
and magnesium stearate. 
The product is available in child-resistant twin single-dose polyethylene terephthalate / aluminium / 
polyethylene laminate sachets. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance (PA21) is a mixture of iron (III)-oxyhydroxide, sucrose and starches (polynuclear 
iron (III)-oxyhydroxide stabilised with sucrose and starches). A mixture of pregelatinised starch and 
potato starch is used. The active substance part of the dossier remains the same as for the authorised 
Velphoro 500 mg chewable tablets, except for minor changes and corrections of typing errors to the 
specification of the raw material and minor textual change in section 3.2.S.3.2 that are part of the 
variation application. These changes are acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Velphoro oral powder in sachet consists of a reddish-brownish granulated powder which may contain 
white speckles in single dose sachets. The powder is suitable for suspension in water or mixing with 
food. The commercial product contains 125 mg iron per sachet. Velphoro oral powder is contained in 
child-resistant twin sachets with aluminium as water vapour barrier as the primary packaging material.  
The oral powder in sachet has been developed in addition to the chewable tablets which are not 
considered appropriate for children less than 6 years of age by the MAH due to the tablet size and the 
risk of accidental choking. The quality target product profile (QTPP), an evaluation of the active 
substance properties and intended finished product properties has been the starting point in the 
development of meaningful in vitro performance tests, both for the tablet and the powder formulation. 
The choice of the pharmaceutical form and strength adequately addressed the clinical need. No further 
elements of QbD have been used. 
Velphoro acts by adsorbing dietary phosphate in the GI tract, preventing its uptake into the blood, 
thereby reducing the serum phosphorus levels. The tablets and the granulated powder contain 
polynuclear iron (III)-oxyhydroxide and work by disintegrating in the upper GI tract and binding 
dietary phosphate on its surface, which is then eliminated via faeces. Thus, the site of action for this 
drug lies in the GI tract. The iron (III)-oxyhydroxide in PA21 is practically insoluble. 
Characteristics of the active substance (AS) that potentially affect the finished product performance 
have been adequately discussed. Particle size of the active substance was not identified as critical but 
is controlled by laser diffraction as part of the active substance specification. The manufacturing 
process of the AS is well controlled and consistently produces the amorphous form which does not 
change upon storage.   
The excipients in the formulation are well known, are widely used in oral pharmaceutical products. 
Compatibility studies were performed with binary mixtures of active substance with several standard 
excipients. The excipients colloidal silicon dioxide, woodberry flavour, magnesium stearate and 
neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, which are ingredients of the chewable tablet were also tested in binary 
mixtures. Appearance, phosphate adsorption, iron release and moisture content were evaluated 
showing no significant impact with the finished components. The choice of the excipients has been 
described and justified. The selected excipients have been shown not to impact the phosphate binding

capacity of the finished product, which is considered a relevant in vitro performance parameter. There 
are no direct safety issues foreseen with regards to the excipients and their quantities for use in 
children from 2 years of age and are considered acceptable for use in children as indicated. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Overall, the formulation development has in general been described in sufficient detail. The QTPP of 
the product seems logical in view of the aim to develop a suitable formulation for use in younger 
children where the chewable tablet formulation is less suitable. The formulation seems suitable to be 
used for children from the age of 2 years. The excipients are suitable, the strength of 125 mg provides 
sufficient dosing flexibility and the product seems to have been well accepted in the clinical studies.  
During the clinical study more dose formulations (125 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg powder for oral 
suspension, and 250 mg, 500 mg chewable tablets) were available. The proposed strength and dose 
recommendations have been justified. 
Velphoro 125 mg oral powder in sachet should be mixed with a small amount of soft food (such as 
apple sauce) or beverage and taken with meals according to the recommendation in the SmPC and 
taken within 30 minutes after being prepared. Results of a compatibility study of the finished product 
with apple sauce and tap water were provided. The compatibility was confirmed for 120 minutes at 
room temperature (i.e. 20-25°C). No impact on potency (iron content) and efficacy (phosphate 
adsorption) was seen. These results confirm the suitability of the SmPC recommendations. Although, 
acceptability/palatability of the finished product mixed with soft foods and beverages was not 
specifically investigated as part of the clinical studies, overall clinical study results were positive with 
regards to acceptability. This is considered sufficient. Furthermore, the feasibility of administration of 
the product through an enteral feeding tube (as claimed in the SmPC) has been investigated and 
relevant information has been included in the product information in accordance with the quality Q&A 
on Administration of oral immediate release medicinal products through enteral feeding tubes. 
The batches of the powder formulation used in the clinical phase 3 paediatric efficacy and safety study 
are representative for the finished product. It has been sufficiently justified from a quality point of view 
that the different formulations (chewable tablet or powder) will not impact the finished product 
performance and no further bridging is needed. 
The manufacturing process development has been adequately described. Wet granulation was selected 
to produce a good granulated powder for the sachet filling. Critical process parameters have been 
identified by a risk evaluation. Laboratory scale trials permitted the selection of the best formulation 
and process for scale-up. The scale-up trial confirmed the high-shear wet granulation as able to 
produce a good granulated powder for the sachet filling. Further optimisation trials were done with the 
wet granulation process by optimisation of the granulation (end point detection of the granulation) 
part. Optimisation of the tooling on the filling line and of the operational parameters was done and 
allowed the process to run with tight in-process control limits especially for the mass variation as 
described. 
The finished product is packed in child-resistant twin single-dose polyethylene 
terephthalate/aluminium/ polyethylene laminate sachet. The container closure system provides 
suitable protection against moisture and light. The suitability of the container closure system was 
confirmed in the stability studies and seal integrity was demonstrated by dye-ingress testing.  
During investigation it was observed that sachets cut along the drawing (diagonally at the lower right 
corner) could not be emptied completely and this resulted in out of specifications (OOS) for the iron 
content and uniformity of dosage units during the stability study. To improve the emptying of the 
sachet and prevent related OOS issues, the positioning of the cutting line was changed to allow for 
removal of the full amount of powder. The choice of the packaging has been justified. The sachet foil

composition was stated and a certificate of analysis of the sachet foil was provided. The packaging 
complies with EN 14375 (Version 2003). The resins of the inner layer made of PE are intended to be in 
contact with the product, comply with the compositional requirements of the Ph. Eur. (3.1.3 
Polyolefines) and with the European Regulation No. 10/2011.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard manufacturing process for solid dosage forms with wet 
granulation, fluid bed drying, sieving and subsequent filling into sachets. No process intermediates are 
isolated during the manufacturing process.  
A risk assessment has been carried out with regard to the target product profile of the product, 
whereby the critical steps in the manufacture of the finished product have been identified and are 
controlled by acceptable in-process controls. Overall, the process is well under control and several 
batches have been manufactured with consistent quality.  
The manufacture of the bulk powder has been evaluated on 20 batches at full production scale at the 
current manufacturing site. The sachet filling process has been evaluated on three full production scale 
batches. The process was shown to be adequately under control leading to finished product with 
consistent quality. For the current manufacturing site, the manufacturing process has been adequately 
validated.  
The MAH submitted a change management protocol with the scope to switch to a new site for the 
commercial supply of the product together with some related changes in the wet granulation step by 
means of a post-approval variation. The protocol for this change has been provided in the dossier and 
is acceptable. 
For the post-approval change of the manufacturing site, an adequate process validation scheme for the 
first three commercial batches of the 125 mg product has been provided.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance (visual), suspendability (visual), identification of iron (colour reaction/precipitation-Ph. 
Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.), assay (complexometric 
titration), loss on drying (halogen moisture analyser), in vitro phosphate adsorption (UV), and iron 
release (UV).  
The potential impurities of PA21 had been discussed in detail in the already approved active substance 
part. The active substance consists of polynuclear iron (III)-oxyhydroxide containing β-FeOOH, 
stabilised with sucrose, starch and pregelatinised starch. No impurities are present in the finished 
product which are not already present in the active substance. The effect of degradation of the 
components of the finished product on its pharmacological performance has been considered and found 
to be negligible.  
A risk assessment for elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D is described in the dossier. 
Active substance, excipients, manufacturing process and container closure system were evaluated as 
potential sources of elemental impurities. The starting material is identified as the main contributor of 
elemental impurities in the active substance. The assessment concludes that the risk of elemental 
impurity contribution from other sources than the active substance is negligible and the proposed 
control strategy for the finished product is sufficient to meet the requirements of ICH Q3D.

Risk assessment, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for both the finished product 
manufacturing process and the active substance with respect to potential formation of nitrosamine 
impurities. The outcome of the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities 
formation and no risk for cross-contamination with other products. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for nine production scale batches was provided and results complied with the 
specification and therefore indicate consistent manufacture of the finished product. In addition, 
supportive batch analysis of 14 batches of the 250 and 500 mg strengths (used in clinical studies) 
were also presented; all complied with the specifications. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out on three commercial scale batches of Velphoro 125 mg oral 
powder in sachet manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site stored at long term conditions (25 
°C ± 2 °C / 60 % ± 5 % RH and 30 °C ± 2 °C / 75 % ± 5 % RH) for 36 months and at accelerated 
conditions (40 °C ± 2 °C / 75 % ± 5 % RH) for 6 months according to the ICH guidelines. 
Additional supportive stability data were presented for three batches of 500 mg oral powder in sachet 
(strength not intended for marketing) under the same storage conditions as supportive information. 
The following parameters were investigated in the stability studies: appearance, microbiological 
quality, assay (iron), loss on drying, iron release, in vitro phosphate adsorption and uniformity of 
dosage units. The analytical methods used for testing the stability samples are the same as those used 
for release testing. The reported results complied with the specification under long term and 
accelerated conditions. 
No clear trends were seen in any of the tested parameters at all three storage conditions. Incidental 
out-of-specification results (OOS) for assay and uniformity of dosage units have been observed in one 
of the three stability batches at a couple of time points stored under long term conditions. The 
observations and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) were described in detail in the 
stability report. The root causes were identified, and subsequent batches were manufactured after the 
appropriate CAPA took place. The CAPA concerned adjustment of the sachet filling weight based on the 
actual iron content of the bulk and amended sachet opening instructions which allows the sachet to be 
completely emptied. The accelerated storage stability data indicated good chemical and physical 
stability. No chemical or physical changes have been observed. No OOS results have been reported. 
The bulk powder was stated to be slightly hygroscopic. Although no formal photostability study for the 
powder formulation has been provided in the dossier, it is known from the chewable tablet formulation 
that both the active substance and chewable tablets were not sensitive to light exposure. It is 
considered justified to extrapolate these results to the powder formulation. Moreover, the finished 
product is packed in sachets that provide moisture as well as light protection and it is unlikely that the 
product will be stored outside its primary packaging. Therefore, it is not considered necessary that the 
need for moisture or light protection is further investigated or that a corresponding precautionary 
statement is included in the labelling. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted on the active substance being subjected to aqueous, 
acidic, basic and photo stress conditions. The results of these studies which have been assessed during 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 14/84 
 
 
 
the initial authorisation can be extrapolated to the finished product Velphoro 125 mg oral powder in 
sachet considering the nature of the active substance the formulation of the finished product and the 
excipient compatibility study results. 
Based on the overall stability data the proposed shelf-life of 3 years without special storage conditions 
as per sections 6.3 and 6.4 can be accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. The 
excipient magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing process for the finished product is non-
standard and the required validation data has been provided. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical 
performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted within this application which is considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Non-clinical studies have shown that very little iron is released from PA21 in simulated GI) conditions 
representative of the fed state. Maximum release of iron (approximately 6%) has been shown to occur 
at pH <2, and in humans, pH levels <2 in the GI tract are normally observed in an empty stomach, 
i.e., in a fasting state. Since PA21 is to be administered with food, a pH <2 in the stomach will not be 
encountered in the normal clinical use of PA21. Moreover, only a fraction of the iron released from 
PA21 is expected to be absorbed. Iron absorption is a highly regulated process with physiological 
limits; in patients with CKD, levels of hepcidin are increased, resulting in reduced absorption of iron 
from the intestinal tract. Together with the low release of iron from PA21, systemic absorption of iron 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 15/84 
 
 
 
from PA21 is expected to be low. As such, a conventional programme of clinical pharmacology studies 
has not been performed for PA21. No new Non-clinical Pharmacology studies have been submitted in 
this application which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Velphoro remains and acts locally in the GI tract. Therefore, systemic interactions are not considered 
likely, although they might occur in the GI tract. The approach taken was to study adsorption to PA21 
and/or degradation of concomitant drugs in the presence of PA21 in vitro under physiologically relevant 
conditions. The low potential for PA21 to bind to or interact with an extensive number of commonly co-
administered drugs and dietary components (including vitamins) has been demonstrated, and selected 
drugs were identified for a clinical study in vivo. No new Non-clinical Pharmacokinetic studies have 
been submitted in this application which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies were submitted by the applicant. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Carbohydrates like sucrose and starches are exempted because they are unlikely to result in significant 
risk to the environment (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006). Therefore, only the polynuclear iron 
(III)-oxyhydroxide (pn-FeOOH) needs further consideration. Since Fe is an (essential) metal, the PBT 
assessment is not required. The default PECsw in the influent of the sewage treatment plants (STP) is 
estimated at 0.024 mg/L. Against a background concentration of phosphate (P) of 7 mg/L in STP 
influent in the Netherlands (CBS 2019), an environmental risk assessment is deemed not necessary, 
given the nature of the active ingredient that is bound to phosphate. It is also considered that in STP 
where chemical phosphate binding is required, iron salts are added to the influent water in a Fe/P ratio 
of 3:2. At 7 mg P/L iron would be added at a concentration of approximately 19 mg/L. Sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide is already used in existing marketed products and no significant increase in 
environmental exposure is anticipated based on above justification. Therefore, the increased use of 
Velphoro due to the newly added paediatric indication is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment and no new ERA studies are warranted. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data was submitted, and no issues are raised regarding the non-clinical aspects. 
Overall, the primary pharmacodynamic studies already provided with previous applications provided 
adequate evidence that Velphoro is efficacious for the proposed indication. The increase to the 
environment of velphoro due to the newly added paediatric indication does not warrant new ERA 
studies. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
This application for a line extension / extension of indication is approvable from a non-clinical 
viewpoint.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Overview of clinical studies 
One study was performed: 
Study PA-CL-PED-01 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, prospective, open-label, parallel-group, 
active-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of PA21 (Velphoro®; sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide) for reducing serum phosphorus levels in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD in 
comparison with Phoslyra liquid solution, a calcium acetate phosphate binder, approved in the US 
without age restriction. 
The PDCO had suggested the possibility of an additional comparison with an external control (e.g. 
sevelamer). The applicant made an effort for this additional comparison with an external control from 
paediatric Study SVCARB07609, a published Phase 2 study conducted with sevelamer carbonate (SC) 
in CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia (from Fathallah-Shaykh et al, 2018, and ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT01574326). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The MAH did not perform new PK studies which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. This 
submission pertains to the agreed PIP, which were to include only single safety and efficacy study, thus 
no additional report was submitted on human PK. The PA21 drug substance is presented as a chewable 
tablet with a content of approximately 2.5 g PA21, containing 500 mg iron. Two slightly different PA21 
drug formulations have been used to manufacture the PA21 chewable tablets used in the clinical 
studies. Comparability of the 2 drug substance formulations was demonstrated by comparison of iron 
release, structure, oxidation state, hydration state, particle size, batch analysis, and stability data. 
In addition, a limited programme of non-clinical “bridging” studies showed that PA21-2 behaved in a 
similar manner to PA21-1 in terms of toxicity profile, genotoxic potential, and iron uptake/absorption. 
Velphoro is almost not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
PA21-2 drug substance was used to manufacture the chewable tablets used in the Phase 3 studies (PA-
CL-05A/05B and PA-CL-PED-01) and in in vivo DDI studies. PA21-2 drug substance was also used for 
the powder for oral suspension used in the paediatric study PA-CL-PED-01, subject to this application. 
In the Phase 3 paediatric study PA-CL-PED-01, 2 PA21 dosage forms were used: a powder for oral 
suspension, provided at dosage strengths of 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg and iron, and chewable 
tablets, provided at dosage strengths of 250 mg and 500 mg iron. The doses used in the paediatric 
study started at 125 to 1,250 mg iron depending on subject age and were up titrated to maximum 
doses of 1,000 to 3,000 mg iron. 
The 500 mg chewable tablets used in the paediatric study PA-CL-PED-01 are similar to the registered 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 17/84 
 
 
 
500 mg chewable tablets, while the 250 mg tablet is dose-proportional to the 500 mg tablet. The new 
powder for oral suspension was used to obtain the 500, 250 and 125 mg doses. The same drug 
substance as used in the registered chewable tablets, i.e. PA21-2, is used for the powder for the oral 
suspension. Considering the composition of the formulations, no difference in binding properties is 
expected.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new PK or PD data has been presented with this application which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. The 500 mg chewable tablets used in the paediatric study PA-CL-PED-01 are similar to the 
registered 500 mg chewable tablets, while the 250 mg tablet is dose proportional to the 500 mg tablet. 
The new powder for oral suspension was used to obtain the 500, 250 and 125 mg doses. The same 
drug substance as used in the registered chewable tablets, i.e. PA21-2, is used for the powder for the 
oral suspension. Considering the composition of the formulations, no difference in binding properties is 
expected.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The application is considered approvable from a pharmacological viewpoint. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The MAH did not perform dedicated dose-response studies, this was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study PA-CL-PED-01 
Study PA-CL-PED-01 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, prospective, open-label, parallel-group, 
active-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of PA21 (Velphoro®; sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide) for reducing serum phosphorus levels in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD in 
comparison with Phoslyra liquid solution, a calcium acetate phosphate binder, approved in the US 
without age restriction. 
Methods 
A schematic diagram of the study design is presented below in Figure 1:  
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 18/84 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Study design 
The study consisted of: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a screening period of up to 4 weeks,  
a washout (pre-randomisation) period of up to 3 weeks for subjects previously taking PBs 
whose serum phosphorus levels were below age-specific targets,  
a dose titration period of up to 10 weeks (Stage 1),  
and a 24-week safety extension (Stage 2); subjects were followed for 14 days after their last 
study visit.  
Thus, the expected duration of subject participation was a maximum of 43 weeks.  
Study Participants  
Subjects whose serum phosphorus levels were above age-specific pre-randomisation targets (see 
Figure 1 above) were eligible for the study. 
Inclusion criteria 
The study planned to enrol subjects 0 to <18 years old at the time of consent who had CKD and 
hyperphosphatemia according to age-specific criteria.  
Subjects ≥1-year-old were to have: 
−  Stage 4-5 CKD defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 or  
−  Stage 5 CKD with at least 2 months of adequate maintenance HD or PD before screening.  
−  Home HD subjects could be included; no nocturnal HD (overnight stay at the site) was allowed. 
Subjects < 1-year-old were to have CKD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 19/84 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were to be either phosphate binder-naïve or receiving a stable regimen of a phosphate 
binder(s) for at least 1 month prior to screening. Subjects who were receiving phosphate binders 
whose serum phosphorus levels were below age-specific target ranges were to undergo a mandatory 
washout before randomisation. 
Subjects or their parents/legal guardians were to provide written informed consent (and, where 
appropriate/required, assent) before any study-specific procedures were performed, including 
screening procedures. 
Exclusion criteria 
Key exclusion criteria were as follows: hypercalcaemia (per age-specific definition) or hypocalcaemia 
(serum total corrected calcium <1.9 mmol/l (7.6 mg/dl)) at screening; iPTH levels >700 pg/ml at 
screening; parathyroidectomy planned or expected within the next 12 months; body weight <5 kg 
(phosphate binder -naïve) or <6 kg (receiving stable phosphate binder regimens) at screening; a 
history of major GI surgery or significant GI disorders; estimated life expectancy of <12 months; (for 
subjects on PD) history of peritonitis in the last 3 months or ≥3 episodes in the last 12 months; and 
use of more than two phosphate binders concomitantly before screening. 
Other exclusion criteria were: known sero-positivity to human immunodeficiency virus; a history of 
haemochromatosis or other iron accumulation disorders; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal at screening; use of any prohibited medications; 
hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the active substances or excipients to be administered; 
previous randomisation in this study; current participation in or recent completion of any other 
investigational drug or device study (within 30 days before screening), or use of any other 
investigational agent; pregnancy, breast-feeding, or unwillingness to use highly effective contraception 
during the study and up to 1 month after the last dose of study drug; a history of substance abuse 
within 2 years before screening; and any other significant medical condition or anticipated need for 
major surgery that could result in increased risk to the subject or interfere with study assessments or 
outcomes. 
Treatments 
Washout (pre-randomisation) period 
Subjects who were phosphate binder -naïve or previously taking phosphate binders and whose serum 
phosphorus levels were as indicated in Table 2 could be randomised when results from the screening 
visit were available for assessment of study eligibility. 
Subjects previously taking phosphate binders whose serum phosphorus levels were below pre-
randomisation targets (Table 2) underwent a washout period of up to 3 weeks before randomisation. 
Serum phosphorus levels were to be monitored weekly for up to 3 weeks of washout. As soon as their 
serum phosphorus levels increased to those specified in Table 2, they could be randomised and begin 
the treatment period. If serum phosphorus remained below the levels specified in Table 2 after 3 
weeks of washout, the subject was not to be randomised.

Table 1 Study PA-CL-PED-01- Age-related serum phosphorus targets pre- and post-
randomisation 
Stage 1 
Stage 1 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, dose-titration period during which subjects 
received PA21 or Phoslyra for up to 10 weeks.  
Doses of PA21 or Phoslyra were increased or decreased as required to achieve age-specific target 
serum phosphorus levels, provided a subject had received a stable dose for a minimum of 2 weeks 
(see Table 1 above), or for safety or tolerability reasons at any time. 
Serum phosphorus levels were measured weekly during the screening and washout period and two-
weekly during Stage 1 and Stage 2. Dose modifications could, therefore, be done two-weekly during 
Stage 1 and Stage 2.  
Subjects randomised to PA21 received PA21 at a starting dose based on their age (see Table 2 and 
Table 3 below for dose modifications and maximum doses of Velphoro).  
Subjects randomised to Phoslyra (calcium acetate) received either Phoslyra at the starting dose of 0.45 
ml/kg/day or an equivalent dose of their previous phosphate binder (calcium-based or sevelamer) if 
the Investigator considered this more appropriate (see Table 4 and Table 5 below for dose 
modifications and maximum doses of Phoslyra).

Beginning at Week 4, once a subject achieved the age-specific target serum phosphorus level (see 
above - Table 2 for age-related serum phosphorus targets), he or she moved to Stage 2. 
Stage 2 
Stage 2 was an open-label, long-term safety extension lasting 24 weeks. All subjects were to enter this 
safety extension stage. During Stage 2, subjects continued the dose they were receiving at the end of 
Stage 1, unless a dose change was required; dose modifications followed the same guidelines used in 
Stage 1.

Numbers of participants to be included 
It was planned to enrol approximately 130 subjects, of whom  
•  100 would be randomised to receive PA21 and  
•  30 would be randomised to receive the active comparator Phoslyra (calcium acetate).  
The study also aimed to randomise minimum numbers of subjects in particular age groups. 
Dosing of study medication 
Subjects in this study were randomised to receive either the test medication PA21 (Velphoro) (100 
subjects) or the active comparator Phoslyra (calcium actetate) (30 subjects). 
•  Subjects randomised to PA21 were to receive PA21 at a starting dose based on their age. 
Subjects randomised to PA21 were to be provided with the formulation most appropriate for their 
age group:  
−  powder for oral suspension for subjects <6 years old or  
− 
chewable tablets for subjects ≥6 years old.  
−  However, due to the possibility of increments of 125 mg/day for dose changes in subjects 6 
to 9 years old, subjects in this age group would ideally receive powder for oral suspension.  
−  Subjects could change formulations if necessary but were to continue the same dose. 
•  Subjects randomised to Phoslyra received either Phoslyra at the starting dose of 0.45 ml/kg/day or 
an equivalent dose of their previous phosphate binder (calcium-based or sevelamer) if the 
Investigator considered this more appropriate. 
Doses of PA21 or Phoslyra were to be increased or decreased as required to achieve age-specific target 
serum phosphorus levels, or for safety or tolerability reasons (at any time). Serum phosphorus levels 
were measured weekly during the screening and washout period and two-weekly during Stage 1 and 
Stage 2. Dose modifications could, therefore, be done two-weekly during Stage 1 and Stage 2. 
Study medications 
• 
PA21 (Velphoro), at an age-dependent starting dose of 125, 500, 750 or 1,250 mg iron/day, to be 
titrated in increments of 125 to 500 mg iron/day according to efficacy and safety criteria (age-
dependent maximum doses ranged from 1,000 to 3,000 mg iron/day). Two formulations of PA21 
were used in this study: a red-brown powder for oral suspension, provided at dosage strengths of 
125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg, and a red-brown chewable tablet, provided at dosage strengths of 
250 mg and 500 mg. Dose increments of 125 and 250 mg; 125, 250 and 375 mg; and 500 mg 
were possible for age groups 2-6 years, 6-9 years, and > 9 years, respectively. 
•  Calcium acetate (Phoslyra; Lyne Laboratories Inc., Brockton, MA 02301, US), at a starting dose of 
0.45 ml/kg/day, to be titrated in increments of 0.1 to 0.2 ml/kg/day according to efficacy and 
safety criteria (body weight-dependent maximum doses ranged from 6.0 to 44 ml/day). Phoslyra 
was provided as an oral solution containing 667 mg of calcium acetate per 5 ml, equivalent to 169 
mg (8.45 mEq) calcium. 
Duration of study treatment 
Duration of treatment was as follows:  
•  Stage 1: Up to 10 weeks. 
Beginning at Week 4, subjects who achieved the target levels or who completed 10 weeks of 
treatment could move on to Stage 2. 
Assessment report

•  Stage 2: 24 weeks. 
A long-term safety extension in which they continued on the same dose they were receiving at the 
end of Stage 1, unless dose change was required.

end of Stage 1 of 1.2 mg/dl and a standard deviation for the change of 2.0, and further allowing for an 
estimated drop-out rate of 30%, 100 randomised subjects would provide more than 90% power. One 
hundred (100) subjects were also considered sufficient to provide robust safety and dosing information 
for PA21 in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised to treatment (PA21 or Phoslyra) via IRT at the baseline visit at the 
beginning of Stage 1 (following screening or washout where required), and were allocated a 
randomisation number in accordance with the randomisation schedule generated by the Biostatistics 
department of ALMAC Clinical Technologies and reviewed by the Sponsor biostatistician.  
Randomisation was stratified by age group, and also aimed to randomise minimum numbers of 
subjects per age group. Subjects retained their randomisation numbers for the duration of their 
participation; randomised subjects who withdrew from the study for any reason, regardless of whether 
they received treatment, also retained their randomisation numbers 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was conducted in an open-label manner. However, the Sponsor was not to receive any data 
or data summarised by treatment group during the conduct of the study in order to preserve the 
integrity of the trial. In particular, the Sponsor was not to attend closed sessions of DSMB meetings 
where data summarised by treatment group could be disclosed. 
Statistical methods 
Population used for the primary analysis 
The following subject populations were used for presentation and analysis of the data: 
• 
• 
FAS population: all subjects randomised to treatment at Stage 1 who received at least 1 dose of 
randomised treatment and who had at least 1 post-BL assessment of the efficacy endpoint (serum 
phosphorus level), analysed according to treatment randomised.  
PPS population: all subjects in the FAS population who had no major protocol violations, analysed 
according to treatment randomised.  
•  Safety population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication, analysed 
according to treatment received.  
•  Stage 2 safety population: all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication during 
Stage 2, analysed according to treatment received.

The FAS population was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy parameters. It was also 
used for analyses of protocol deviations, demographic and BL characteristics and medical history. A 
subset of BL characteristics and efficacy parameters was evaluated for the PPS population. The safety 
population was the primary population for the analysis of safety endpoints. 
General Methods 
Tabulations were to be produced for appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy and safety 
parameters. For categorical variables, summary tabulations would present the total number of 
observations and the number of missing observations as well as the number and percentage within 
each category of the parameter; for continuous variables, summary tabulations would present the total 
number of observations and the number of missing observations, mean, median, standard deviation 
(SD), first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum values. Formal statistical 
hypothesis testing was to be performed on the primary endpoint only, at a 2-sided 0.05 significance 
level.  
Summary statistics were to be presented, as well as confidence intervals for selected parameters, as 
described below. Other statistical testing within each group could be performed for the secondary 
efficacy endpoints depending on observed clinical differences. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change in serum phosphorus levels from baseline to the end of 
Stage 1 (i.e., considering the last available value from Stage 1) in the PA21 group. It was to be based 
on central laboratory data; in case of missing data, the change from baseline was to be computed 
using pre- and post-treatment values from the local laboratory.  
The change from baseline was to be analysed using a linear mixed model with treatment, baseline 
serum phosphorus, age (in categories) at randomisation, region and gender as fixed effects. Summary 
statistics with the estimate of the adjusted mean change from baseline and its 95% confidence interval 
(95% CI) as well as the corresponding p-value from the t-test were also to be provided. Sensitivity 
analyses were to include a repeat of the main analysis based on observed data from the central 
laboratory only (with no imputation using local laboratory data).  
Homogeneity of the results of the primary endpoint was to be investigated through analysis of change 
from baseline in subgroups defined by age at randomisation, region, gender, prescribed formulation, 
serum phosphorus at baseline according to the age-related normal range and the combination of age 
at randomisation and serum phosphorus at baseline according to the age-related normal range using 
the same linear mixed model as above. 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints related to change from baseline in serum phosphorus level, 
summary statistics with 95% CIs for the mean change were to be provided by treatment group using 
the same linear mixed model as for the primary efficacy endpoint. Box plots were to be generated for 
the change in serum phosphorus levels from baseline for each treatment arm to the end of Stage 1 
and to the end of Stage 2 for the FAS and PPS Populations. Serum phosphorus values over time based 
on central and local laboratory measurements were to be summarised separately by treatment group 
using descriptive statistics. 
In addition, plots were to be provided with one curve for each treatment arm representing the mean 
change (±standard error of the mean (SEM)) from baseline in serum phosphorus levels at each time 
point to the end of Stage 1 and to the end of Stage 2 for the FAS and PPS Populations using central 
laboratory data. For the percentages of subjects with serum phosphorus values within specified ranges, 
number and percentage calculated using the number of subjects with non-missing serum phosphorus 
level as denominators with corresponding exact 95% CIs were to be provided by treatment group.

Safety Analyses 
Summaries were to be presented for all TEAEs, for TEAEs by causality, by intensity (as assessed by the 
Investigator) and by age at randomisation (0-<2 years, 2-<6 years, 6-<12 years and 12-≤18 years), 
TEAEs of special interest (those potentially related to diarrhoea, potential iron overload, potential 
masking of GI bleeding, and deficiencies in growth and skeletal development or abnormalities of bone 
markers), treatment-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs, serious treatment-related TEAEs, serious TEAEs 
leading to death, non-serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, and TEAEs by time 
of onset.  
Percentage of subjects who developed at least 1 episode of sustained hypercalcaemia after start of 
treatment was to be provided by treatment group. For clinical laboratory parameters including serum 
iPTH levels, actual values and changes from baseline were to be summarised at each time point by 
treatment group based on central laboratory measurements. For serum phosphorus, total calcium and 
albumin, both central and local laboratory summary tables were to be provided. Shift tables from 
baseline to each post-baseline visit were to be produced using the low/normal/high classification based 
on laboratory reference ranges (if available for the paediatric population).  
For vital signs, actual values and changes from baseline at each time point were to be summarised by 
treatment group, also by categories of age at randomisation within treatment groups.  
Other Analyses 
Patient-reported palatability and acceptability assessments were to be summarised by treatment 
group. Subject-reported palatability and acceptability were measured using a 5-point facial hedonic 
scale combined with a 10-cm VAS. The ends were defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be 
measured, oriented from the left (better; lower scores) to the right (worse; higher scores). 
Results 
The MAH provided the following flow diagram of Figure 2. Of the 120 subjects screened, 85 subjects 
were randomised (66 subjects were randomised to PA21 and 19 were randomised to Phoslyra). All of 
these subjects received at least 1 dose of their randomised study treatment.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
• 
• 
The clinical study protocol version 1.0 was finalised on 26 March 2015. An amendment to the 
protocol was issued during the phase of regulatory submission. The protocol version 2.0 was 
finalised on 22 September 2015 and was used for global study conduct. 
Two (2) country-specific substantial amendments were made to the protocol upon requests from 
local regulatory agencies: Protocol version 3.0 (France only), dated 23 June 2016, and Protocol 
version 4.0 (Russia only), dated 6 September 2016. 
•  On 17 July 2018, the EMA agreed to reduce the required minimum numbers of recruited subjects 
to at least 60 subjects to be randomised into the PA21 group, as mentioned earlier in this AR. 
Following the agreements with the EMA and FDA, the Sponsor ended the study on 11 March 2019. 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were identified in a total of 33 (41.3%) subjects, 23 (35.4%) subjects in the 
FAS PA21 group and 10 (66.7%) subjects in the FAS Phoslyra group. Most of the major deviations in 
the PA21 group and all of those in the Phoslyra group concerned non-compliance with study drug. 
Three subjects were included in the FAS and Safety Populations despite major deviations from study 
eligibility criteria (one took anti-convulsive medication; one started on growth hormone and one has 
exclusionary intact parathyroid hormone level). Major protocol deviations are summarized in table 
below (Table 6): 
Table 6 Major protocol deviations (FAS population) 
Treatment compliance 
In the PA21 group, mean (SD) compliance was 87 (26.9) % during Stage 1, 75 (25.8) % during Stage 
2 and 79 (23.6) % during the overall study.  
In the Phoslyra group, mean (SD) compliance was 72 (56.0) % during Stage 1, 55 (35.8) % during 
Stage 2 and 62 (37.9) % during the overall study.  
Results in each age group showed the same general pattern seen in the full Safety Population. 
Compliance during Stage 1 was generally comparable across age groups. During Stage 2 and during 
the overall study, compliance was lower among subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation than in 
the younger age groups.  
Compliance was slightly higher among female subjects than among male subjects during Stage 1, 
slightly higher among male subjects during Stage 2 and comparable between genders during the 
overall study; standard deviations were large in both subgroups.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 29/84 
 
 
 
 
Compliance was slightly higher among non-US subjects than among US subjects; however, standard 
deviations were large in both subgroups.  
During Stage 1 and during the overall study, compliance was slightly higher among subjects prescribed 
sachets only or both tablets and sachets than among those prescribed tablets only. However, the 
smaller numbers of subjects prescribed sachets only and both tablets and sachets should be 
considered. Standard deviations were also large in all 3 subgroups. 
Baseline data 
Demographic data 
In the FAS population, subject age at randomisation ranged from 2 to 18 years. At baseline, 54 
(67.5%) subjects in the FAS Population were on haemodialysis and 10 (12.5%) subjects were on 
peritoneal dialysis; no subjects were on both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and 16 (20.0%) 
subjects were not on dialysis. See Table 8 below for demographic data:

Demographic characteristics in the PPS population were similar to those in the FAS population. 
Assessment of the baseline (BL) comparability of treatment groups is difficult in this population due to 
the small number of subjects in the PPS Phoslyra group (N=5).

Baseline (BL) disease characteristics in the PPS and safety population were similar to those in the FAS 
population.  
Dose 
Forty-six (46) of the 66 subjects in the PA21 group were prescribed tablets only; 10 subjects were 
prescribed sachets only, and 10 subjects were prescribed both formulations. The average daily dosage 
and an average number of sachets/tablets for each subgroup are displayed below. Similar data are 
displayed according to age group. 
During the overall study, the maximum prescribed daily dosage in the PA21 group ranged from 500 to 
3000 mg iron, with a mean (SD) of 1856.1 (744.61) mg iron. The maximum prescribed daily dosage in 
the Phoslyra group ranged from 7 to 44 ml, with a mean (SD) of 25.3 (13.18) ml. 
During Stage 1, the actual average daily number of tablets/sachets taken ranged from 0.7 to 6.9, with 
a mean (SD) of 3.18 (1.111) and a median of 3.14. During the overall study, the actual average daily 
number of tablets/sachets taken ranged from 0.5 to 7.5, with a mean (SD) of 3.24 (1.262) and a 
median of 3.26.

Numbers analysed 
Numbers of subjects in the various analysis populations (defined in the statistical methods section of 
this synopsis) are presented in the table below in Table 10: 
Table 10 Numbers of subjects included in populations for analysis (safety population) 
Only 51 subjects were included in the Stage 2 safety population, and only 47 subjects were included in 
the PPS; numbers were particularly small in the Phoslyra group (8 subjects and 5 subjects 
respectively). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The overall change in serum phosphorus levels from baseline to the end of Stage 1 in the PA21 group 
As shown in Table 12 below, change in serum phosphorus level from BL to the end of Stage 1 was not 
statistically significant in the FAS PA21 group (p=0.1456), with an LS mean (standard error (SE)) of -
0.120 (0.081) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.282, 0.043).

Table 12 Change in serum phosphorus level from baseline to end of stage 1 in PA21 group, 
by age at randomization (FAS population) 
As expected, baseline serum phosphorus levels were higher in the younger age groups. 
Change in serum phosphorus level from baseline to the end of Stage 1 in the PA21 group was not 
statistically significant in the full FAS Population. Reductions in serum phosphorus level were observed 
with PA21 in all age groups; however, a statistically significant reduction in serum phosphorus was 
achieved only in the subgroup of subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation. 
•  Among subjects ≥2 to <6 years old at randomisation (N=6), the LS mean (SE) for change from 
baseline was -0.078 (0.123) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.468, 0.312) or -0.243 (0.380) mg/dl (95% CI: -
1.450, 0.965). 
•  Among subjects ≥6 to <12 years old at randomisation (N=17), the LS mean (SE) for change from 
baseline was -0.200 (0.158) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.541, 0.141) or -0.620 (0.489) mg/dl (95% CI: -
1.675, 0.436). 
•  Among subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation (N=42), the LS mean (SE) for change from 
baseline was -0.149 (0.062) mmol/l (95% CI -0.274, -0.023) or -0.460 (0.192) mg/dl (95% CI: -
0.850, -0.070). The change from baseline in this age group was statistically significant 
(p=0.0220).

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Change in serum phosphorus levels from baseline to the end of Stage 1 in the Phoslyra group   
The actual mean serum phosphorus levels for Phoslyra were 2.15 mmol/L at baseline and 2.14 mmol/L 
at stage 1 (reduction by 0.01 mmol/L). The LS mean (SE) for change between baseline and stage 1 
was -0.615 (0.320) mmol/l (95% CI: -1.339, 0.110) based on the mixed model calculations (i.e. 
results are obtained from a linear mixed model which includes change in serum phosphorus levels from 
baseline to the end of Stage 1 as dependent variable and treatment, baseline serum phosphorus, age 
(in categories) at randomization, region (Non-US/US) and gender as fixed effects). Also, here the 
difference was not statistically significant. 
In the PPS population, the LS mean (SE) for change in serum phosphorus level from BL to the end of 
Stage 1 in the Phoslyra group was -0.502 (0.000) mmol/l; the associated 95% CIs could not be 
computed due to the small number of subjects in this group (N=5) (see below Table 13). 
Table 13 Change in serum phosphorus level from baseline to end of stage 1 in Phoslyra 
group (FAS population) 
Change in serum phosphorus levels from baseline to the end of Stage 2 in the PA21 and Phoslyra 
groups  
In the FAS population, the LS mean (SE) for change in serum phosphorus level from BL to the end of 
Stage 2 was 0.099 (0.198) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.306, 0.504) in the PA21 group and -0.393 (0.218)

mmol/l (95% CI: -3.167, 2.380) in the Phoslyra group. However, it should be noted that the 
corresponding 95% CIs did not exclude zero; therefore, no true underlying difference between 
treatments was demonstrated. It should be noted that results for the end of Stage 2 were available for 
only 36 subjects in the PA21 group and 6 subjects in the Phoslyra group. Serum phosphorus levels at 
BL were generally comparable between treatment groups (see below Table 15).  
In the PPS population, results for the PA21 group were similar to those in the FAS population: the LS 
mean (SE) for change in serum phosphorus from BL to the end of Stage 2 in this group was 0.149 
(0.198) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.266, 0.564) for the PA21 group. Data from the end of Stage 2 were 
available for only 3 subjects in the Phoslyra group; as a result, LS means (SEs) and corresponding 
95% CIs for change from BL could not be calculated for this group.

Table 15: age-related serum phosphorus targets post-randomization 
At BL, 2 (3.08%) subjects in the FAS PA21 group had a serum phosphorus level below the age-related 
target range as assessed by the central laboratory, 11 (16.92%) subjects had levels within target 
ranges, and 52 (80.00%) subjects had levels above target ranges.  
In the Phoslyra group, 1 (6.67%) subject had a level below, 1 (6.67%) subject had a level within, and 
13 (86.67%) subjects had levels above target ranges. At the end of Stage 1, 39.06% of PA21 subjects 
and 13.33% of Phoslyra subjects with central laboratory data had serum phosphorus levels within 
target ranges; the corresponding figures at the end of Stage 2 were 35.00% for PA21 and 25.00% for 
Phoslyra.  
At BL, 1 (2.38%) subject in the PPS PA21 group had a serum phosphorus level below age-related 
target ranges as assessed by the central laboratory, 9 (21.43%) subjects had levels within target 
ranges, and 32 (76.19%) subjects had levels above target ranges. In the PPS Phoslyra group, all 5 
subjects had BL levels above target ranges. At the end of Stage 1, 45.24% of PPS PA21 subjects and 
40.00% of PPS Phoslyra subjects with central laboratory data had serum phosphorus levels within 
target ranges; the corresponding figures at the end of Stage 2 were 39.29% for PA21 and 50.00% for 
Phoslyra.

ranges, and 40 (61.54%) subjects had levels above normal ranges.  
In the Phoslyra group, 1 (6.67%) subject had a level below, 5 (33.33%) subjects had levels within, 
and 9 (60.00%) subjects had levels above normal ranges.  
At the end of Stage 1, 60.94% of PA21 subjects and 40.00% of Phoslyra subjects with central 
laboratory data had serum phosphorus levels within normal ranges; the corresponding figures at the 
end of Stage 2 were 57.50% for PA21 and 25.00% for Phoslyra.

At BL, 1 (2.38%) subject in the PPS PA21 group had a serum phosphorus level below the age-related 
normal range as assessed by the central laboratory; 16 (38.10%) subjects had levels within normal 
ranges and 25 (59.52%) subjects had levels above normal ranges.  
In the PPS Phoslyra group, 3 (60.00%) of the 5 subjects had levels within normal ranges and 2 
(40.00%) had levels above normal ranges. At the end of Stage 1, 71.43% of PPS PA21 subjects and 
80.00% of PPS Phoslyra subjects with central laboratory data had serum phosphorus values within 
normal ranges; the corresponding figures at the end of Stage 2 were 57.14% for PA21 and 50.00% for 
Phoslyra. 
At BL, only 2 subjects in the PPS PA21 group had local laboratory assessment of serum phosphorus; 1 
(50.00%) subject had a level within the age-related normal range and 1 (50.00%) subject had a level 
above the normal range. No subjects in the Phoslyra group had local laboratory data at BL. At the end 
of Stage 1, 50.00% of PPS PA21 subjects and 33.33% of PPS Phoslyra subjects with local laboratory 
data had serum phosphorus values within normal ranges; the corresponding figures at the end of 
Stage 2 were 60.00% for PA21 and 0% for Phoslyra (it should be noted that results for end of Stage 2 
were available for only 15 PPS PA21 subjects and 2 PPS Phoslyra subjects). 
In summary, reductions in serum phosphorus level were observed with PA21 in all age groups; 
however, a statistically significant reduction in serum phosphorus was achieved only in the subgroup of 
subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation. Important and statistically significant reduction in 
Assessment report

serum phosphorus was achieved in subjects with serum phosphorus levels above the age-related 
normal range at BL. 
Serum phosphorus values at each visit during Stage 1 and 2  
In the FAS population, serum phosphorus levels assessed by the central laboratory showed consistent 
slight decreases from BL in the PA21 group, while fluctuation relative to BL was observed in the 
Phoslyra group: the small numbers of subjects in the Phoslyra group (total N=15) should be noted (see 
Figure 3).  
In the PPS population, serum phosphorus levels assessed by the central laboratory showed slight 
decreases from BL at nearly all time points in the PA21 group. In this population, the Phoslyra group 
also showed small decreases from BL at most time points; it should be noted that only 5 Phoslyra 
subjects were included in the PPS population.

population) 
Patient-reported palatability and acceptability 
Subject-reported palatability and acceptability were measured using a 5-point facial hedonic scale 
combined with a 10-cm VAS. The ends were defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be 
measured, oriented from the left (better; lower scores) to the right (worse; higher scores). 
At time points where data were available for more than a few subjects, scores were generally low 
(indicating good palatability/acceptability) for both treatments. At the end of Stage 2, mean scores 
were lower (more favourable) for PA21 than for Phoslyra. Time points at week 4, end of Stage 1 and 2 
were scored by 49, 60 and 39 subjects, respectively. 
•  Overall like/dislike: mean (SD) scores at the end of Stage 1 were 3.58 (2.445) cm in the PA21 
group, and 3.39 (2.905) cm in the Phoslyra group; corresponding figures at the end of Stage 2 
were 2.43 (2.862) cm in the PA21 group and 5.47 (4.161) cm in the Phoslyra group.

take: mean (SD) scores at the end of Stage 1 were 4.13 (3.006) cm in the PA21 group and 3.95 
(3.603) cm in the Phoslyra group; corresponding figures at the end of Stage 2 were 4.47 (3.729) 
cm in the PA21 group and 5.10 (3.607) cm in the Phoslyra group. 
The items “how easy to give to your child” and “your child found acceptable” were assessed by the 
parent or carer for subjects ≤2 years old using a 10-cm VAS. The ends were defined as the extreme 
limits of the parameter to be measured, oriented from the left (better; lower scores) to the right 
(worse; higher scores). Results for these items were available for only 1 PA21 subject for most time 
points, and no data were available for Phoslyra. 
•  How easy to give to your child: scores in the PA21 group ranged from 0.30 to 7.90 cm; the mean 
score at the end of Stage 1 was 4.10 cm.  
• 
Your child found acceptable: scores in the PA21 group ranged from 0.50 to 8.00 cm; the mean 
score at the end of Stage 1 was 3.90 cm. 
In conclusion, results for subject-reported palatability and acceptability were available for very few 
subjects at most time points. At time points where data were available for more than a few subjects, 
scores were generally low (indicating good palatability/acceptability) for both treatments. At the end of 
Stage 2, mean scores were lower (more favourable) for PA21 than for Phoslyra. 
Ancillary analyses 
Primary efficacy endpoint according to age-related normal ranges at baseline 
Among subjects whose serum phosphorus was above age-related normal ranges at baseline (N=40), 
serum phosphorus levels showed statistically significant decrease from baseline to the end of Stage 1 
(LS mean (SE): -0.282 (0.096) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.476, -0.087) p=0.0058), while no significant 
change was observed among subjects whose baseline phosphorus was within or below normal ranges 
(N=25; LS mean (SE): 0.082 (0.146) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.224, 0.388).  
Greater reduction was seen in all age groups among subjects with high baseline phosphorus. Among 
subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation, the decrease seen among subjects with high baseline 
phosphorus (N=23) was statistically significant (LS mean (SE): -0.312 (0.081) mmol/l (95% CI: -
0.482, -0.141) p=0.0011).

Primary efficacy endpoint according to other subgroups 
Patients not on dialysis 
Additional analyses have been performed to investigate the characteristics of the group of paediatric 
patients not on dialysis at baseline as well as the treatment effect, safety profile and the dosing in 
order to address the benefit/risk in this group. 
−  Demographics 
Regarding the demographic characteristics, it was shown that from the total of 66 subjects on Velphoro 
in the SAF population, 15 (23%) were not on dialysis and 51 (77%) were on dialysis. Distribution of 
subjects not on dialysis and on dialysis (and their demographic characteristics) was reasonably 
balanced across age groups: 12-≤18 years (60% in not on dialysis group; 66.7% in group on dialysis), 
6-<12 years (26.7% and 25.5%) and 2-<6 years (13.3% and 7.8%).  
−  Treatment effect 
A smaller change in serum phosphorus level from baseline to end of stage 1 was observed in the group 
not on dialysis (LS mean (SE) of -0.042 (0.080) mmol/L vs -1.174 (-0.083) on dialysis), which can 
likely be explained by the lower, close to normal range, serum phosphorus level at baseline in this 
group not on dialysis (i.e. 1.84 mmol/L) than in the group on dialysis (i.e. 2.15 mmol/L) and 
percentage already at normal range at baseline (60% vs 32%), and thus on average a lower need for 
change to reach normal serum phosphorus levels.  
Also, the proportion of patients reaching normal range levels was slightly higher in the subjects not on 
dialysis at stage 1 (20% vs 25%) and stage 2 (13% vs 23%), however, the total proportion of patients 
in the normal range was greater in the patients not on dialysis than for the dialysis patients both at 
Stage 1 (57% vs 80%) and during the maintenance phase Stage 2 (55% vs 73%). 
−  Dosing 
The average daily dose was only slightly lower in the not on dialysis group (1742 mg vs 1890 mg), and 
the actual number of tablets/sachets taken were comparable (n=3.1 vs n=3.3). The number of 
subjects with at least one dose change was generally comparable between groups not on dialysis 
(n=10 (67%)) and on dialysis (n=37 (72.5%)). Findings were largely similar across age groups. These 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 47/84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data suggest that comparable dosing has been applied to patients not on dialysis, and dose 
recommendations should therefore not be different for these group of patients.  
Gender 
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by gender showed greater decreases in serum phosphorus 
in females than in males. However, the 95% CIs for the respective subgroups overlapped considerably. 
LS means (SEs) for change from baseline were -0.177 (0.096) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.373, 0.018) for 
females and -0.026 (0.130) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.294, 0.242) for males. 
Region 
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by region (US/non-US) showed greater decreases in serum 
phosphorus in US subjects than in non-US subjects; the decrease observed among the US subjects 
was statistically significant. However, the 95% CIs for the respective subgroups overlapped 
considerably. LS means (SEs) for change from baseline were -0.214 (0.103) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.424, 
-0.005) for US subjects (p=0.0450) and -0.060 (0.139) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.348, 0.228) for non-US 
subjects. 
Formulation 
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by formulation - Greater decreases in serum phosphorus 
from baseline to the end of Stage 1 were observed among PA21 subjects who were prescribed sachets 
only or both formulations than among those prescribed tablets only; however, the 95% CIs for the 
respective subgroups overlapped considerably. Among subjects who were prescribed tablets only 
(N=46), the LS mean (SE) for change from baseline was -0.032 (0.094) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.222, 
0.159). Among subjects who were prescribed sachets only (N=10), the LS mean (SE) for change from 
baseline was -0.232 (0.140) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.621, 0.157). Among subjects who were prescribed 
both formulations (N=9), the LS mean (SE) for change from baseline was -0.166 (0.166) mmol/l (95% 
CI: -0.626, 0.293). However, the smaller numbers of subjects prescribed sachets only and both tablets 
and sachets should be considered.

Title: An Open-label, Randomised, Active-controlled, Parallel Group, Multicentre, Phase 3 
Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of PA21 (Velphoro®) and Calcium Acetate 
(Phoslyra®) in Paediatric and Adolescent CKD Patients with Hyperphosphataemia 
Study identifier 
PA-CL-PED-01  
Design 
Study PA-CL-PED-01 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, prospective, 
open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled study. 
Stage 1 was an open-label, randomised, active-controlled, dose titration 
period during which subjects received PA21 or Phoslyra. 
Stage 2 was an open-label, long-term safety extension lasting 24 weeks. All 
subjects were to enter this safety extension stage. During Stage 2, subjects 
continued the dose they were receiving at the end of Stage 1, unless a dose 
change was required. 
Serum phosphorus levels were measured weekly during the screening and 
washout period and two-weekly during Stage 1 and Stage 2. Dose 
modifications could therefore be done two-weekly during Stage 1 and Stage 
2. 
To evaluate the efficacy of PA21 in reducing serum phosphorus levels in 
paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD at the end of Stage 1.

Hypothesis 
The primary hypothesis is a reduction in serum phosphorus levels from 
baseline to the end of Stage 1 in the PA21 group. 
Treatments groups 
PA21 (Velphoro; sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide) 
100 subjects to receive PA21 at a starting 
dose based on their age.  
In Stage 1 dose will be increased or 
decreased as required to achieve age-
specific target serum phosphorus levels (see 
Tables 5 and 6 above for dose modifications 
and maximum doses of PA21).  
30 subjects to receive Phoslyra received 
either Phoslyra at the starting dose of 0.45 
ml/kg/day (see Tables 7 and 8 above for 
dose modifications and maximum doses of 
Phoslyra) or an equivalent dose of their 
previous PB number randomized.

Descriptive comparison with Sevelamer 
Following EMA Paediatric Committee advice from the Modification Summary Report Day 30 
(EMA/170421/2018), the Sponsor decided to include additional comparison with an external control 
from paediatric Study SVCARB07609 (EudraCT No. 2011-002329- 23), a Phase 2 study conducted with 
sevelamer carbonate (SC) in CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia (Fathallah-Shaykh et al, 2018) 
where appropriate. 
The Sponsor selected this external control from available studies in hyperphosphataemic paediatric 
patients with CKD due to the large sample size and the fact that results of this study supported the 
extension of the indication for SC to paediatric patients in the EU (EMA/271022/2016 and 
EMA/352101/2017). However, due to differences in the design of the studies, there are limitations to 
this comparison.

Figure 3 Design of sevelamer study SVCARB07609 
Most notably, the age-related pre-randomisation target levels for sP were slightly higher in Study 
SVCARB07609 and a long term 26 weeks titration period after 2 weeks of fixed dose period was 
applied for the sevelamer study, while a titration period of 10 weeks followed by 24 weeks stable 
dosing was applied for Velphoro. 
Baseline sP levels were higher in Study SVCARB07609 (means (SDs): 7.22 (2.07) mg/dl for the SC 
group and 7.15 (1.92) mg/dl for the placebo group) than in Study PA-CL-PED-01 (means (SDs): 6.41 
(1.615) mg/dl for the FAS Velphoro group used in the efficacy analyses; 6.38 (1.625) mg/dl for the 
safety population), and higher percentages of subjects in Study SVCARB07609 had elevated sP at 
baseline. 
In both studies, compliance with study treatment was generally good; mean compliance rates were 
≥68% in all treatment groups and study periods. Compliance rates for Velphoro treatment were higher 
than those for SC or its matching placebo. 
Although decreases in sP levels were observed with Velphoro treatment both at the end of the DTP 
(Stage 1; primary efficacy endpoint) and at the end of the maintenance period (Stage 2; secondary 
endpoint), these changes were not statistically significant.  
In contrast to Velphoro, with sevelamer the change from baseline in sP levels was statistically 
significantly greater with SC than with placebo at the end of the 2-week fixed dose phase; little change 
was observed in the placebo group. At the end of the DTP (titration phase), changes from baseline in 
sP level were statistically significant in both treatment groups (subjects originally randomised to SC 
and subjects who crossed over from placebo to SC during the DTP), as well as in the 2 groups 
combined (p<0.0001). Mean changes from baseline in sP level in the SC treatment groups were 
numerically greater than those observed with Velphoro; however, the differences in the designs of the 
2 studies limit the interpretability of this difference. 
• 
• 
In Study PA-CL-PED-01 (Velphoro), the LS mean (standard error (SE)) change from baseline in sP 
levels at the end of Stage 1 (DTP) was -0.371 (0.251) mg/dl in the FAS Velphoro group 
(p=0.1456); the LS (SE) for change from baseline to the end of the maintenance period (Stage 2) 
was 0.307 (0.614) mg/dl (p=0.6207). 
In Study SVCARB07609 (sevelamer), the LS mean (SE) difference between the SC and placebo 
groups in sP levels at the end of the FDP (SC minus placebo) was -0.90 (0.270) mg/dl (p=0.001); 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 53/84 
 
 
 
 
 
mean (SD) changes from baseline at this time point were -0.86 (1.649) mg/dl for SC and 0.04 
(1.478) mg/dl for placebo. At the end of the DTP, mean (SD) changes from baseline in sP levels 
were -1.23 (2.206) mg/dl among subjects originally randomised to SC (p=0.001) and -1.13 
(2.061) mg/dl among subjects who crossed over from placebo to SC (p=0.0001); among subjects 
who completed the study, corresponding figures were -0.94 (2.116) mg/dl among subjects 
originally randomised to SC (p=0.0010) and -1.12 (1.840) mg/dl among subjects who crossed 
over from placebo to SC (p=0.0001). 
Subgroup analysis sevelamer study 
In Study PA-CL-PED-01, statistically significant decrease in sP levels from baseline to the end of Stage 
1 (DTP) was also seen amongst subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation (N=42; LS mean (SE): 
-0.460 (0.192) mg/dl; p=0.0220; PA-CL-PED-01 CSR); changes from baseline to the end of Stage 1 
were not statistically significant for subjects <12 years old at randomisation (LS means (SEs): -0.243 
(0.380) mg/dl (p=0.5682) for subjects ≥2 to <6 years old and -0.620 (0.489) mg/dl (p=0.2271) for 
subjects ≥6 to <12 years old; PA-CL-PED-01 CSR). Subgroup analysis by both age group and baseline 
sP level showed a statistically significant decrease in sP levels from baseline to the end of Stage 1 
(DTP) amongst subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomisation whose baseline phosphorus was above 
age-related normal ranges (N=23; LS mean (SE): -0.965 (0.252) mg/dl; p=0.0011), but not amongst 
subjects in this age group whose baseline phosphorus was below or within age-related normal ranges 
(LS mean (SE): 0.146 (0.287); p=0.6198). 
Results for Study SVCARB07609 were not reported by age in the publication by Fathallah-Shaykh et al, 
2018. However, the FDA Office of Clinical Pharmacology Integrated Review Report observed that the 
difference between treatments in LS mean change from baseline (SD) amongst subjects 6 to <13 
years old was 0.05 (0.55) mg/dl (95% CI: -1.04, 1.15) versus -1.40 (0.34) mg/dl (95% CI: -2.07, -
0.72) for subjects 13 to 18 years old (N=35 for SC; N=36 for placebo), though the small number of 
subjects in the younger group (N=13) was noted. Moreover, the US Prescribing Information for 
Renvela (SC) notes that the subgroup with sP levels <7.0 mg/dl (who showed little difference between 
treatment groups) included many subjects who were 6 to <13 years old and/or not on dialysis. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study PA-CL-PED-01 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, prospective, open-label, parallel-group, 
active-controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety of PA21 (Velphoro®; sucroferric 
oxyhydroxide) for reducing serum phosphorus levels in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD, 
both on dialysis as not on dialysis aged 2 years and above, in comparison with Phoslyra liquid solution, 
a calcium acetate phosphate binder, approved in the US without age restriction. The study also aimed 
to introduce a new paediatric formulation of 125 mg powder for oral suspension to the already 
available 500 mg chewable tablets. The study consists of a dose-titration period of up to 10 weeks 
(Stage 1), and a 24-week safety extension (Stage 2). The protocol of Study PA-CL-PED-01 has been 
agreed upon in the PIP for PA21 (PIP decision: EMEA-001061-PIP01-10-M03), however amendments 
have been made to the number of patients included (see results).  
The inclusion criteria are generally acceptable to identify a paediatric population with CKD and 
hyperphosphatemia. It should be noted that the inclusion criteria and the newly claimed paediatric 
indication are wider than the current adult indication, as paediatric patients not on dialysis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 54/84 
 
 
 
classified as CKD Stage 4-5 could also be included. Exclusion criteria are generally acceptable, 
especially to yield possible optimal patient inclusion during the entire study period.  
The dosing and duration of treatment, objectives, the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary efficacy 
endpoints, as well as the safety endpoints, the proposed sample size, the randomization, the blinding 
and methodology are in general in line with the assessment of the protocol as agreed in the PIP (PIP-
decision EMEA-001061-PIP01-10-M03), and therefore acceptable.  
However, it should be noted that only single measurements were used for baseline and primary and 
relevant secondary endpoints, which can limit interpretation of the data.  
Furthermore, the primary analysis was performed using a linear mixed model including baseline value, 
age, region and gender as covariates, while in the PIP-decision a paired t-test was proposed. But 
additional analyses (paired t-test and the 2 post-hoc sensitivity) show similar and consistent results 
with those displayed in the CSR of the PA-CL-PED-01 study concerning the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient flow 
Eighty-five children were randomized in the study (Velphoro: n=66 and Phoslyra: n=19). This was 
lower as the initially planned sample size due to recruitment problems, but the number of the patients 
randomized in the study is in line with what has been agreed by PDCO/EMA on 17 July 2018, to reduce 
the required minimum numbers of recruited subjects to at least 60 subjects to be randomized into the 
Velphoro group. However, due to these limited number of patients the study was not adequately 
powered to make an adequate comparison with Phoslyra (calcium acetate) to provide clear findings to 
evaluate the effect for reducing serum phosphorus levels. Also, indirect comparison with sevelamer (as 
requested by PDCO) should be handled with caution due to study differences and small study numbers. 
There were 35 screening failures, 31 of who did not meet the inclusion criteria.  
Furthermore, the number of patients who completed the study was low, with 28 out of 85 (33%) 
randomized patients. However, safety or lack of efficacy was not the main reason for decision of 
discontinuation. Further, although numbers are small and thus data should be interpreted carefully, 
subjects with high serum phosphorus, CKD Stage 4 and those not on dialysis at baseline were at 
higher risk for discontinuations, which can be expected, since the stage of disease might play an 
important role in discontinuations.The majority of the patients are recruited from the US, with the rest 
of the population recruited in EU, which may somewhat limit interpretation for the EU setting.  
Major protocol deviations mainly included non-compliance. Compliance was generally higher in the 
PA21 group (87%) versus the Phoslyra group (72%), but numbers were too small to conclude that this 
may impact the interpretation of the data.  
Demographics and disease characteristics 
The baseline characteristics were generally sufficiently well distributed across the two treatment 
groups, although the number of patients in the Phoslyra group was small. The study population can be 
considered representative of paediatric and adolescent patients with Stage 4-5 CKD. The mean 
baseline phosphorus level was just above the target level (2.08 mmol/L; see Table 4 for age-related 
target levels) likely due to immediate inclusion of patients just after a higher level than target level 
was observed based on a single measurement.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 55/84 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose 
Considerations with regards to the dose recommendations during the study, the dose recommendation 
currently proposed in the SmPC, and dosing results in the study have been sufficiently justified and are 
appropriately reflected in the product information. 
Primary and secondary endpoints 
The primary endpoint showed a limited non-statistically significant LS mean (SE) difference from 
baseline to end of stage 1 (titration phase) in serum phosphorus levels of -0.120 (0.081) mmol/l (95% 
CI: -0.282, 0.043) in the PA21 treatment group (n=65) based on the mixed model calculations with 
actual data showing a mean of 2.08 mmol/L at baseline and 1.91 mmol/L at stage 1 (reduction by 0.17 
mmol/L).  
A limited effect was maintained during the 24 weeks follow-up (stage 2), although some fluctuations in 
mean effect over time were noticed with an effect of 0.099 (0.198) mmol/L (95% CI -0.306, 0.504) 
observed at the end of the 24 weeks period (stage 2).  
The observed decrease in serum phosphorus levels resulted in 39% of the patients being within the 
target range at stage 1 and 35% at the end of 24-week stage 2, with 17% being within the target 
range at baseline. It should however be noted that the number of patients above the target range still 
consisted of the largest group of patients, with 80% at baseline to 58% at Stage 1 and 63% at the end 
of Stage 2. 
A statistically non-significant and substantially less than initially envisaged treatment effect in these 
children was observed, that can be explained by the difficulties in treating these patient groups and 
based on several factors in design and conduct of the study, including large proportion at normal 
serum phosphorus levels. Despite these limitations, the long-term maintenance of serum phosphorus 
levels in the patients within the normal range is considered of main clinical relevance to reduce 
morbidity and mortality in this paediatric population. 
Efficacy for comparator Phoslyra (calcium acetate) 
The limited number of patients (n=15) treated with Phoslyra (calcium actetate) showed comparable 
efficacy with Velphoro although no formal statistical testing was performed. Phoslyra showed an effect 
from baseline to the end of stage 1 of -0.615 (0.320) mmol/l (95% CI: -1.339, 0.110) with actual data 
showing a decrease of 0.01 mmol/L from a baseline level of 2.15 mmol/L to 2.14 mmol/L at the end of 
stage 1 (titration phase).  
The effect (LS mean (SE) difference) was -0.393 (0.218) mmol/L (95%CI -3.167, 2.380) at end of the 
24 weeks period (stage 2), and 13% and 25% of the children were within the target range at stage 1 
and 2, respectively, while 7% of the children were within target range at baseline. Also, here, the 
majority of pediatric patients remained with a serum phosphorus level above the target range (87%, 
80%, 75% at baseline, stage 1 and stage 2, respectively). 
Subgroup analyses 
For the approximately 20% of the children who were not on dialysis, a clinically relevant treatment 
effect in patients not on dialysis comparable to dialysis patients has been observed. A smaller change 
in serum phosphorus level from baseline to end of stage 1 was observed in the group not on dialysis 
(LS mean (SE) of -0.042 (0.080) mmol/L vs -1.174 (-0.083) on dialysis), which can likely be explained 
by the lower, close to normal range, serum phosphorus level at baseline in this group not on dialysis 
(i.e. 1.84 mmol/L) than in the group on dialysis (i.e. 2.15 mmol/L) and percentage already at normal 
range at baseline (60% vs 32%), and thus on average a lower need for change to reach normal serum 
phosphorus levels. Also, the proportion of patients reaching normal range levels was slightly higher in 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 56/84 
 
 
 
the subjects not on dialysis at stage 1 (20% vs 25%) and stage 2 (13% vs 23%), however, the total 
proportion of patients in the normal range was still greater in the patients not on dialysis than for the 
dialysis patients both at Stage 1 (80% vs 57%) and during the maintenance phase Stage 2 (73% vs 
55%). Overall, such findings are considered of clinical relevance for both the dialysis and the non-
dialysis patients.  
Also, the average daily dose was only slightly lower in the not on dialysis group (1742 mg vs 1890 
mg), and the actual number of tablets/sachets taken were comparable (n=3.1 vs n=3.3). The number 
of subjects with at least one dose change was generally comparable between groups not on dialysis 
(n=10 (67%)) and on dialysis (n=37 (72.5%)). Dosing applied appears therefore not to deviate 
substantially from the dialysis group and thus dose recommendations could be similar. 
The effect for the primary endpoint (change of serum phosphorus levels from baseline to stage 1) 
appears not to be consistent across several subgroups.  
Especially, the youngest age group of 2 to 6 years showed a lower effect (LS mean (SE) of -0.078 
(0.123) mmol/L (95% CI: -0.468, 0312) than older pediatric patients (LS mean (SE) of -0.200 (0.158) 
mmol/L (95% CI: -0.541, 0,141) for 6 to 12 years of age and -0.149 (0.062) mmol/L (95% CI: -
0.274, -0.023), p=0.020 in 12 to 18 years of age), despite the highest baseline serum phosphorus 
levels in the youngest age group (mean (SD) of 2.37 (0.644) mmol/L compared to 2.24 mmol/L in the 
≥6 to <12 years old children and 1.98 mmol/L in the oldest group of children). Thus, reductions in 
serum phosphorus level were observed with PA21 in all age groups. However, statistically significant 
reduction in serum phosphorus was achieved only in the subgroup of subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years of age. 
Furthermore, subjects whose serum phosphorus levels were higher or above age-related normal 
ranges at baseline serum phosphorus levels showed greater reduction from baseline to the end of 
Stage 1. Among subjects whose serum phosphorus was above age-related normal ranges at baseline 
(N=40), serum phosphorus levels showed statistically significant decrease from baseline to the end of 
Stage 1 (LS mean (SE): -0.282 (0.096) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.476, -0.087) p=0.0058), while no 
significant change was observed among subjects whose baseline phosphorus was within or below 
normal ranges (N=25; LS mean (SE): 0.082 (0.146) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.224, 0.388). This could be a 
result of a large proportion of patients with normal range at baseline (36%) included in the study, 
which was due to a large overlap of the different target ranges at screening and at baseline and patient 
intra-variability. 
Also, a difference in gender with a higher reduction in females compared to males (LS means (SEs) for 
change from baseline to stage 1 were -0.177 (0.096) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.373, 0.018) for females and 
-0.026 (0.130) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.294, 0.242) for males) was observed.  
Moreover, US patients have shown greater decreases in serum phosphorus levels compared to non-US 
patients (LS means (SEs) for change from baseline to stage 1 were -0.214 (0.103) mmol/l (95% CI: -
0.424, -0.005) for US subjects (p=0.0450) and -0.060 (0.139) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.348, 0.228) for 
non-US subjects). 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 57/84 
 
 
 
Also, greater decreases in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of Stage 1 were observed 
among PA21 subjects who were prescribed sachets only or both formulations than among those 
prescribed tablets only. Among subjects who were prescribed tablets only (N=46), the LS mean (SE) 
for change from baseline to stage 1 was -0.032 (0.094) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.222, 0.159), for subjects 
on sachets only (N=10) this was -0.232 (0.140) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.621, 0.157), and for subjects on 
both formulations (N=10), this was -0.166 (0.166) mmol/l (95% CI: -0.626, 0.293).  
Comparison to adult data 
In general, the effect observed in this study is substantially lower than observed in adults. Adult data 
as stated in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Velphoro are: “Mean serum phosphorus levels were 2.5 
mmol/L at baseline and 1.8 mmol/L at week 12 for Velphoro (reduction by 0.7 mmol/L).”  
However, the response rates of children in the current study showed generally similar rates within the 
target range compared to adult data (45.3% at week 12 and 51.9% at week 52). 
Comparison to the adult studies may be difficult due to several reasons including difference in 
population and study conduct such as mean baseline phosphorus level only marginally higher than 
target level with a substantial proportion of patients being already within the normal ranges of serum 
phosphorus levels at baseline, compliance issues, uncertainty on baseline and endpoint values due to 
single measurements among other possible reasons. Also, the findings in Phoslyra hampers the same 
issues when any comparison to adult effects are being made.  
Comparison to sevelamer study data 
As requested by PDCO an indirect comparison was made between the Velphoro study and the 
sevelamer study. However, differences in study design and inclusion criteria, amongst other possible 
differences limit the interpretation of this comparison. Most notable differences are the higher baseline 
levels of phosphorus in the sevelamer study population, inclusion of patients > 6 years only in the 
sevelamer study and the difference in titration phase (26 weeks) for sevelamer versus stable dosing 
phase (24 weeks; stage 2) subsequent to the 10-week titration phase (stage 1) for Velphoro.  
Considering all these limitations, the best available comparison would be to compare data for patients 
>6 years only at the end of the study periods for both studies. For PA21 the effect from baseline to the 
end of stage 1 (as stage 2 data are not available) is LS mean (SE) of -0.620 (0.489) mg/dl (95% CI: -
1.675, 0.436) among subjects ≥6 to <12 years old (n=17), while for sevelamer the effect was from 
baseline (SD) to the end of the study amongst subjects 6 to <13 years old: LS mean change 0.05 
(0.55) mg/dl (95% CI: -1.04, 1.15). But the groups were small. 
Among subjects in the PA21 group ≥12 to ≤18 years old at randomization (N=42), the LS mean (SE) of 
PA21 for change from baseline was -0.460 (0.192) mg/dl (95% CI: -0.850, -0.070). The change from 
baseline in this age group was statistically significant (p=0.0220). For sevelamer the effect was -1.40 
(0.34) mg/dl (95% CI: -2.07, -0.72) for subjects 13 to 18 years old (N=35). 
These data fluctuated values and do not show large differences between both medicinal products, 
although this comparison should be handled with caution due to study differences.  
Palatability and acceptability 
Palatability and acceptability of the formulations used in the study were generally scored as good for 
PA21 and similar to better than Phoslyra. 
Starting dose and dose increments 
Based on the study protocol, the starting dose in the age group 2-6 years was 500mg and the 
recommended increments were 125 mg and 250 mg. The Applicant explained their initial proposal of 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 58/84 
 
 
 
 
250mg dose increments with that actual dose increments used during the study have shown to be 250 
mg in 4 out of 6 patients. None of the children in this age group needed a dose increment of 125 mg. 
However, to align with the study protocol, the Applicant has amended the dose increments in the 
SmPC from 250mg to both 125 and 250 mg in children from 2-6 years. This is agreed. 
Regarding the starting dose in the group 6-9 years  – The Applicant presented study data that for one 
of the seven patients the 750 mg was effective. Based on this information, it can be agreed that 750 
mg as a starting dose can be acceptable, and that 875 mg would be too high and would likely lead to 
more intolerability, as for the two patients on 750 mg they discontinued due to gastrointestinal events. 
The justification currently provided by the Applicant of a starting dose of 750 mg is supported. 
Regarding the dose increments - Based on the study protocol, the recommended increments in the 
group of 6-9 years were 125, 250 and 375 mg. The actual dose increments used during the study have 
shown to be 2 by increment of 125 mg, 10 by increment of 250 mg and 6 by increment of 375 mg. 
The Applicant proposed to only have dose increment of 250 mg in this age group for convenience for a 
simple administration scheme. However, this was not considered appropriate as it is conflicting with 
the proposal in the younger age group - two dose increments of 125 and 250 – being in line with the 
study protocol. Therefore, for consistency with the study protocol and the study data, the dose 
increment in the age group 6-9 years was amended in the SmPC into 125, 250 and 375 mg.  
The dose recommendation for the group of 9-<12 years of age was 1000 mg and was based on the 
median daily prescribed dose of 1,293 mg and clinical practice of dose steps of 250 and 500 mg in this 
age group, which is also in line with the recommendations in the study protocol. The dose 
recommendation in the SmPC for this age group of 9-<12 years can therefore be acceptable. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An overall limited reduction of serum phosphorus levels was observed in paediatric patients from 2 to 
18 years of age during 24 weeks of treatment of PA21, but this was not statistically significant. The 
limited treatment effect (which is also smaller than hypothesized) may be due to a mean phosphorus 
baseline level only marginally higher than the target level with even a substantial proportion already at 
normal level (and thus no inherent need for substantial phosphorus lowering), as a result of the study 
design and conduct. Compliance issues, intra-patient variability and perhaps suboptimal titration may 
have been other reason, among other unidentified reasons. Despite the marginal effect, a large 
proportion of patients was within the age-adjusted normal phosphorus range after treatment, 
comparable to that observed for adults, which thus can be considered clinically relevant. Moreover, 
based on the local mechanism of action, any differences in effect to adults is not to be expected.  
The effect appears not to be consistent across several subgroups. However, data are too limited to 
draw any appropriate conclusions. 
This effect was generally comparable to what has been found with the use of calcium acetate and 
sevelamer, although no formal statistics were performed for comparisons. The overall effect on the 
decrease of serum phosphorus levels with Velphoro was lower than in adults, but the responder rates 
of children in the current study showed generally similar rates compared to adult data. A more limited 
effect than for adults may likely have been driven by several issues in study conduct. The overall 
decrease in serum phosphorus levels observed in the paediatric population was small but clinically 
relevant mainly in terms of responder rates.

The highest daily doses that were prescribed in this paediatric trial were: 
•  1250 mg iron per day in subjects 2 to 6 years old at randomisation  
•  2250 mg iron per day in subjects 6 to 9 years old and  
•  3000 mg iron per day in subjects 9 to 18 years old 
The mean (SD) actual average daily dosage in the PA21 group was 1216.19 (526.433) mg iron during 
Stage 1, and 1281.44 (611.800) mg iron for the overall study; the mean (SD) actual average daily 
dosage in the Phoslyra group was 12.41 (8.071) ml during Stage 1 and 12.26 (8.782) ml for the 
overall study. 
In the PA21 group, duration of exposure was slightly longer for female subjects (N=34; means (SDs) 
48.2 (23.21) days during Stage 1 and 131.2 (80.99) days during the overall study) than for male

subjects (N=32; means (SDs) 43.0 (23.32) days during Stage 1 and 121.4 (87.94) days during the 
overall study); actual average daily dosages and maximum prescribed daily dosages were comparable 
between genders. 
In the PA21 group, duration of exposure during Stage 1 was slightly longer among non-US subjects 
(N=27; mean (SD) 49.1 (22.94) days) than among US subjects (N=39; mean (SD) 43.3 (23.43) 
days); duration of exposure considering the overall study, actual average daily dosages and maximum 
prescribed daily dosages were comparable between regions. 
Sachets or tablets 
•  46 of the 66 subjects in the PA21 group were prescribed tablets only;  
•  10 subjects were prescribed sachets only and  
•  10 subjects were prescribed both formulations.  
Duration of exposure, prescribed average daily dosages, maximum prescribed daily dosages and actual 
average daily dosages were higher among subjects who were prescribed tablets only than among 
those who were prescribed sachets only; maximum prescribed daily dosages and actual average daily 
dosages were higher among subjects who were prescribed tablets only than among those who were 
prescribed both formulations. Total numbers of tablets/sachets taken (during Stage 1 and overall) 
were higher for subjects who were prescribed tablets than for those who were prescribed sachets only, 
and were highest for those who were prescribed both formulations. As in the full Safety Population, 
prescribed dosages (and to a lesser extent actual dosages) were higher when considering the overall 
study than when considering Stage 1 only.

The compliance is defined as 100 * the total number of mg of iron received (calculated from the number of tablets/powders 
dispensed - unused tablets/powders returned - unused tablets/powders reported as lost) divided by the total prescribed dose in 
mg iron. Actual exposure data and compliance are set to missing in case all dispensed drug was reported as lost and without

Most common adverse events 
Percentages of subjects experiencing at least 1 TEAE were slightly higher in the Phoslyra group during 
Stage 1 (PA21: 42 (63.6%) subjects; Phoslyra: 13 (68.4%) subjects) and comparable between 
treatment groups during the overall study (PA21: 50 (75.8%) subjects; Phoslyra: 14 (73.7%) 
subjects). 
TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject in either treatment group up to the end of Stage 2) are

Notes: Adverse events are coded using version 19.1 of the MedDRA terminology. SOCs are sorted in descending frequency 
as reported in the PA21 column; PTs are sorted in descending frequency within SOC. If a subject experienced more than 1 
event in a given SOC, that subject is counted once for the SOC. If a subject experienced more than 1 event with a given PT, 
that subject is counted only once for that PT. 
E=Total number of events; MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; N=Total number of  subjects; n=Number of

Overall and in both treatment groups, the incidence of TEAEs was higher during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment than during the subsequent (and mostly longer) periods considered (4 to <12 weeks, 12 to 
<24 weeks, and ≥24 weeks after treatment start). In the SOC of GI Disorders, there was a notable 
decrease in incidence after the first week of treatment in both the PA21 and the Phoslyra groups (28). 
In particular, 7 of the 14 reported TEAEs of diarrhoea (all in the PA21 group) occurred during the first 
week of treatment; 11 of them occurred during the first 4 weeks. In the Phoslyra group as well, 6 of 
the 10 TEAEs reported in the GI Disorders SOC (PTs nausea, vomiting, constipation and abdominal 
pain upper) occurred during the first week of treatment.

E=Total number of events; n=Number of subjects, each subject counts only once for each adverse event; N=Total number of 
subjects; TEAE=Treatment-emergent adverse event. 
Overall, TEAEs were reported in 5 (71.4%) subjects ≥2 to <6 years old at randomisation, 18 (81.8%) 
subjects ≥6 to <12 years old and 41 (73.2%) subjects ≥12 to ≤18 years old; the majority of TEAEs in 
all age groups were reported during Stage 1. The small number of subjects ≥2 to <6 years old at 
randomisation (N=7 overall) limits the conclusions that can be drawn concerning this group. No serious 
TEAEs were reported in this age group. 
TEAEs reported in each age group were qualitatively similar to those reported in the full Safety 
Population, with events reported most frequently in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, infections 
and infestations, and metabolism and nutrition disorders. The greater variety of PTs reported in the 
older groups most likely results from the higher numbers of subjects in these groups.

Although numbers of subjects in each maximum dose prescribed category were small, there did not 
appear to be a relationship between maximum dose prescribed and incidence of TEAEs in the 
categories examined. It should be noted that many subjects required dose adjustments during the 
study, and that TEAEs may have occurred at a dose level lower than the subject’s maximum. 
Percentages of subjects experiencing TEAEs graded as severe up to the end of Stage 2 were generally 
comparable between treatment groups (PA21: 13 (19.7%) subjects; Phoslyra: 3 (15.8%) subjects), 
while percentages experiencing TEAEs graded as moderate were higher in the Phoslyra group (PA21: 
26 (39.4%) subjects; Phoslyra: 9 (47.4%) subjects). 
Patients not on dialysis 
From the total of 66 subjects on PA21 in the SAF population, 51 (77%) were on dialysis and 15 (23%) 
were not on dialysis. 
Overall, no trend could have been identified from the AEs reported in the patients on dialysis (65% 
Stage 1 and 75% Stage 2) as compared to patients not on dialysis (60% Stage 1 and 80% Stage 2)). 
The differences were small.  
Also, no substantial differences according to AE categories suggest for a different safety profile of the 
non-dialysis patients. The percentage of subjects experiencing a TEAE in the SOC of Gastrointestinal 
Disorders was higher in the dialysis group (26 subjects (51.0%)) as compared to 5 subjects (33.3%) in 
the not on dialysis group, but diarrhoea and nausea was more present in the not on dialysis group 
(diarrhoea: 33% not on dialysis vs 14% on dialyses and nausea: 13% not on dialysis vs 8% on 
dialysis).  
Regarding the treatment-related AEs occurring in more than 1 subject (PA21, not on dialysis at 
baseline group) until end of Stages 1 and 2 included PT diarrhoea was higher (5 subjects, 33%) in 
comparison to subjects on dialysis at baseline (6 subjects (12%)). However, the percentage of 
subjects experiencing a TEAE in the SOC of Gastrointestinal Disorders was comparable between the 
PA21 groups on dialysis (33%) and not on dialysis (33%) in both stages of the study treatment and 
does also not suggest for a difference in safety profile. 
The numbers of serious AEs and treatment-related serious AEs were too low to draw any appropriate 
conclusions. Regarding serious AEs 2 subjects (13%) were not on dialysis and 11 subjects (22%) at 
Stage 1. At the end of Stage 2, the percentage of subjects experiencing any serious TEAE was 13% (2 
subjects) in the non-dialysis group an 31% (16 subjects) in the on dialysis group. None of the two 
serious AEs in the not on dialysis group were reported as treatment-related or were the SOC 
Gastrointestinal Disorders.

The percentage of subjects experiencing any TEAE leading to drug withdrawal was higher in the on 
dialysis group (20%) in comparison to the not on dialysis group (7%). Also, the intensity was more 
reported as mild in the not on dialysis group (73%; n=11) compared to the dialysis group (49%; 
n=25).

Percentages of subjects with serious TEAEs were generally comparable between treatment groups 
during Stage 1 (13 (19.7%) vs 3 (15.8%)) and were higher for PA21 than for Phoslyra during the 
overall study (18 (27.3%) vs 3 (15.8%)). PTs reported as serious in more than 1 subject in the PA21 
group were hypertension (5 subjects), device malfunction (2 subjects), fluid overload (2 subjects) and 
weight increased (2 subjects); no PT was reported as serious in more than 1 Phoslyra subject.  
Serious GI TEAEs were reported in 5 subjects: gastritis, ileus, and small intestinal obstruction in the 
PA21 group and small intestinal perforation and vomiting in the Phoslyra group. Five serious TEAEs in 3 
subjects were considered related to study treatment by the investigator, all in the PA21 group: blood 
pressure increased, gastritis, hypertension, ileus and vena cava thrombosis, reported in 1 subject 
each; the blood pressure increased, hypertension and vena cava thrombosis were reported in the same 
subject.  
Deaths 
No TEAEs leading to death were reported in either treatment group. 
Other Significant AEs 
AEs of special interest were defined in the SAP based on the known safety profile of PA21, and included 
events potentially related to diarrhoea, potential iron overload, potential masking of GI bleeding, and 
deficiencies in growth and skeletal development or abnormalities of bone markers.

E = Total number of adverse events; n = Number of subjects, each subject counts only once for each adverse event.. 
Most TEAEs of special interest in the PA21 group were GI (mainly diarrhoea), while all TEAEs of special 
interest reported in the Phoslyra group consisted of hypercalcaemia. There were no reports of TEAEs 
that would suggest either potential iron accumulation or masking of GI bleeding by PA21-associated 
discolouration of faeces. One TEAE of haematochezia (considered unrelated to study treatment) was 
reported in the PA21 group; no TEAE of faeces discoloured was reported for the subject concerned. 
Only 1 TEAE of special interest was graded as severe (an event of diarrhoea in the PA21 group); there 
were no serious TEAEs of special interest in either group. Percentages of subjects with TEAEs of special 
interest that led to study drug withdrawal were comparable between treatment groups (PA21: 8 
(12.1%) subjects; Phoslyra: 3 (15.8%) subjects).  
Laboratory findings 
In Study PA-CL-PED-01, safety endpoints included serum total corrected calcium, phosphorus, Ca × P, 
and iPTH levels, percentage of subjects with at least 1 episode of sustained hypercalcaemia (confirmed 
by repeat sample 1 week later), and routine clinical laboratory tests (including blood iron parameters, 
vitamin parameters and bone markers); eGFR, vital signs and physical examination findings were also 
monitored. As in the studies in adults, the only consistent and clinically significant effect of treatment 
with PA21 for up to 34 weeks was reduction in serum phosphorus levels, the intended clinical effect. 
Changes from baseline in serum total corrected calcium were minimal in both treatment groups. 
•  As expected, the incidence of sustained hypercalcaemia was higher in the Phoslyra group than 
in the PA21 group: 4 (21.1%) subjects in the Phoslyra group and 6 (9.1%) subjects in the 
PA21 group experienced at least 1 episode of sustained hypercalcaemia during the study. 
• 
In the PA21 group, mean values for serum total corrected calciumphosphorus product (based 
on central laboratory assessment) were at or below the KDOQI target level of 4.4 mmol2/l2 
from Week 8 Stage 1 until the end of Stage 2; in the Phoslyra group, mean values were 
generally above this target level (however, the small numbers of subjects with available results 
should be noted). 
•  Mean (SD) baseline values for serum iPTH were 30.36 (26.393) pmol/l or 0.286 (0.2490) 
ng/ml in the PA21 group and 37.12 (19.527) pmol/l or 0.350 (0.1842) ng/ml in the Phoslyra 
group. No clinically meaningful changes were observed during the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 69/84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Mean (SD) baseline values for eGFR were 29.89 (17.864) ml/min/1.73 m2 in the PA21 group 
and 20.36 (3.229) ml/min/1.73 m2 in the Phoslyra group; this difference is probably related to 
the higher percentage of Phoslyra subjects with Stage 5 CKD (17 (89.5%) subjects vs 52 
(78.8%) subjects for PA21 in the Safety Population). No clinically meaningful changes were 
observed during the study. 
•  Although some changes from baseline and individual shifts relative to normal ranges were 
observed for clinical laboratory parameters including routine haematology and chemistry, liver 
enzymes, iron status parameters, vitamins and bone markers, they showed no trends or 
clinically relevant changes. 
• 
For haematocrit and haemoglobin, shifts from normal to low were observed in both treatment 
groups, but showed no trends. The majority of subjects had low baseline values for these 
parameters: of the subjects with data for End of Stage 1 (N=59 for PA21 and N=13 for 
Phoslyra), 72.9% of PA21 subjects and 61.5% of Phoslyra subjects had low baseline 
haematocrit; 66.1% of PA21 subjects and 61.5% of Phoslyra subjects had low baseline 
haemoglobin. Medical histories of anaemia were frequent (anaemia was reported in 42.4% of 
subjects overall in the Safety Population, nephrogenic anaemia in 32.9% and iron deficiency 
anaemia in 5.9%), and most subjects in both treatment groups were receiving antianaemic 
medications including growth factors, iron preparations, folic acid and Vitamin B12 (PA21: 53 
(80.3%) subjects; Phoslyra: 18 (94.7%) subjects); approximately half were receiving iron 
supplementation. 
•  There were no clinically meaningful effects on vital signs or physical examination findings, and 
no relevant differences between treatment groups were observed. 
Changes from BL in serum total corrected calcium were minimal in both treatment groups. Mean 
values for Ca × P in the PA21 group were at or below the KDOQI target level of 4.4 mmol2/l2 
beginning at Week 8 Stage 1. As expected, the incidence of sustained hypercalcaemia was higher with 
Phoslyra than with PA21 (4 (21.1%) versus 6 (9.1%) subjects). No clinically meaningful changes in 
serum iPTH levels or in eGFR were observed during the study. 
Although some changes from BL and individual shifts relative to normal ranges were observed for 
clinical laboratory parameters including routine haematology and chemistry, liver enzymes, iron status 
parameters, vitamins and bone markers, they showed no trends or clinically relevant changes. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new drug-drug interaction studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs that led to study drug withdrawal was lower for PA21 
than for Phoslyra both during Stage 1 (PA21: 11 (16.7%) subjects; Phoslyra: 6 (31.6%) subjects) and 
during the overall study (PA21: 12 (18.2%) subjects; Phoslyra: 6 (31.6%) subjects). 
Considering all events reported up to the end of Stage 2, TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were 
reported most frequently in the SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders, metabolism and nutrition disorders 
and infections and infestations. Preferred terms that led to study drug withdrawal in more than one 
subject in the PA21 group were diarrhoea (6 subjects), nausea (2 subjects) and vomiting (2 subjects); 
those in the Phoslyra group were hypercalcaemia (3 subjects) and hyperphosphatemia (2 subjects).

Supportive study 
The PDCO had suggested the possibility of an additional comparison with an external control (e.g. 
sevelamer). The applicant made an effort for this additional comparison with an external control from 
paediatric Study SVCARB07609, a published Phase 2 study conducted with sevelamer carbonate (SC) 
in CKD patients with hyperphosphataemia (from Fathallah-Shaykh et al, 2018, and ClinicalTrials.gov 
NCT01574326). 
This external control was selected due to the large sample size and the fact that results of this study 
supported the extension of the indication for SC to paediatric patients in the EU (EMA/271022/2016 
and EMA/352101/2017). However, there were several limitations to this comparison due to differences 
in study design: there was the unequal durations of the study periods and the different methods of 
summarising the reported events. 
An overview of the TEAEs during both studies is given below:

Description of AEs in Study SVCARB07609: 
Note: The documentation does not report frequencies of TEAEs other than hypertension and vomiting; 
serious and non-serious events are summarised separately (so no overall frequencies are presented for 
events reported as both serious and non-serious) and provides frequencies by preferred term only; for 
non-serious events, a cut-off of 5% of subjects is used, apparently based on frequencies during the 
DTP (overall rather than by original randomised treatment). Thus, it is not possible to provide detail for 
all of the statements made in the Fathallah-Shaykh paper. In particular, no information is available 
concerning the frequency of constipation.  
The following information on TEAEs is available: 
The most frequent TEAEs during the FDP were hypertension in the sevelamer group (reported in 2 
(4.1%) subjects) and vomiting in the placebo group (reported in 3 (5.9%) subjects). Other common 
TEAEs in the placebo group included nausea, constipation and upper abdominal pain; non-serious 
events of nausea and upper abdominal pain were each reported in 2 (3.4%) subjects in this group. The 
most frequent TEAEs during the DTP were GI disorders, including constipation, vomiting and upper 
abdominal pain. Non-serious TEAEs of vomiting were reported in 19 (19%) subjects overall, nausea 
was reported in 15 (15%) subjects, abdominal pain in 13 (13%) subjects, upper abdominal pain in 9 
(9%) subjects and diarrhoea in 8 (8%) subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 72/84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most SAEs consisted of viral or bacterial infections; others included GI disorders, metabolism and 
nutrition disorders and vascular disorders. The most frequent SAEs in the SC group were abdominal 
pain, dialysis catheter malfunction and/or occlusion and pyrexia; the most frequent SAE in the placebo 
group was renal impairment. SAEs reported in the SC group during the FDP were hypertension in 2 
(4.1%) subjects and device occlusion, hyperkalaemia and peritonitis in 1 (2.0%) subject each; the 
single SAE in the placebo group was viral gastroenteritis. During the DTP, SAEs reported in >1 subject 
overall were abdominal pain and pyrexia in 3 (3.0%) subjects each and anaemia, bacteraemia, 
constipation, device malfunction, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypotension, peritonitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection in 2 (2.0%) subjects each. 
Two subjects, 1 in each treatment group, experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
during the FDP; these consisted of mild hyperphosphataemia in both cases. During the DTP, 3 subjects 
in the continuous SC group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. 
Summary 
In summary, the applicant considered that the frequencies of TEAEs overall and of SAEs were roughly 
comparable between the Velphoro and SC groups, given the limitations resulting from the unequal 
durations of the study periods considered and the different methods of summarising the reported 
events (cumulative versus separate for each period). In both groups of subjects, GI disorders and 
events related to the underlying disease were prominent; hypertension was also noted in both groups. 
Diarrhoea, the most frequent TEAE reported in the Velphoro group, is known to be associated with 
orally administered iron compounds. Diarrhoea was not mentioned in the Fathallah-Shaykh 2018 
publication; according to the clinicaltrials.gov posting for Study SVCARB07609, non-serious events of 
diarrhoea were reported in 1 (2.0%) subject in the SC group during the FDP (versus none in the 
placebo group) and in 8 (8.0%) subjects overall during the DTP, and there was 1 SAE of diarrhoea 
during the DTP. Reported SAEs in both the Velphoro and the SC treatment groups were characteristic 
of the studied population; few SAEs in either treatment group were considered treatment-related. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were more frequent among subjects receiving Velphoro than among those 
receiving SC; in the Velphoro group, treatment-related events consisted predominantly of GI 
symptoms that occurred early in treatment. TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were more 
frequent in Study PA-CL-PED-01 (in both treatment groups) than in Study SVCARB07609 (in either 
treatment group). In the Velphoro treatment group, the most frequent TEAEs leading to study drug 
withdrawal were GI symptoms, most of which occurred early in treatment, while in Study 
SVCARB07609, TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were related to the underlying condition of 
hyperphosphataemia. 
Overall, the AE profile of Velphoro in Study PA-CL-PED-01 was similar to that reported for SC in Study 
SVCARB07609, the main difference being the occurrence of GI symptoms known to be associated with 
orally administered iron compounds (notably diarrhoea and discolouration of faeces). These events 
resulted in higher frequencies of TEAEs considered related to study treatment and of TEAEs leading to 
withdrawal of the study drug in Study PA-CL-PED-01. It should be noted that most of these GI events 
(and particularly diarrhoea) tended to occur early in the study, with a notable decrease in incidence 
after the first week of treatment. 
No trends or clinically relevant changes were observed for clinical laboratory values or vital signs in 
either study.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Known safety profile of Velphoro in adults 
The safety profile of Velphoro is characterised by gastrointestinal adverse events of mild nature, which 
reflects its local action and limited absorption. Most common events are diarrhoea and discoloured 
faeces. Potential concerns include events potentially related to diarrhoea, potential iron overload, 
potential masking of GI bleeding, and deficiencies in growth and skeletal development or abnormalities 
of bone markers. There were no new concerns or signals with regard to the TEAEs of special interest 
for Velphoro used in the paediatric population 
Pediatric study 
The applicant has submitted a clinical study (Study PA-CL-PED-01) to extend the indication to the 
pediatric population (see efficacy section for the specific design). The primary safety endpoints of this 
study were defined as the AE profile and the percentage of withdrawals due to AEs.  
The safety population was smaller than originally planned, due to enrolment difficulties. The study 
enrolled 66 subjects on Velphoro and 19 on Phoslyra, aged 0 to <18 years old. Six children in the age 
group ≥2 to <6 years were included in the Velphoro arm and 1 in the Phoslyra arm, which somewhat 
limits the interpretation of the safety data. The small number of patients in each age group for 
Phoslyra also suffers similar limitations. 
The overall duration of exposure was longer on Velphoro, compared to Phoslyra. During Stage 1, mean 
(SD) duration of exposure was 45.7 (23.23) days for Velphoro vs 37.8 (28.38) days for Phoslyra; for 
the overall study, this was 126.5 (83.92) days and 73.9 (73.57) days respectively. This may be 
affected to the fact that approximately 58% of subjects in the Phoslyra group withdrew from the study 
during Stage 1 compared to 35% for Velphoro. 
A high proportion of subjects experiencing at least 1 TEAE for both Velphoro and Phoslyra during the 
overall study (Velphoro: 50 (75.8%) subjects; Phoslyra: 14 (73.7%) subjects), but this could likely be 
of the underlying disease. Diarrhoea (18.2%), nausea (12.1%), and vomiting (9.1%) were mostly 
reported in the Velphoro group and mostly occurred at initiation and dose titration of therapy in line 
with adult observations. However, dose titration limitations due to AEs (i.e. 2 out of the 26 diarrhoea, 
nausea or vomiting reports) were rarely observed. Diarrhoea and discoloured faeces were only seen on 
Velphoro. This appears approximately in line with study data in adults, which showed 42% GI events 
with, 18.1% diarrhea, 14.9% faeces discoloured, 6.3% nausea, 4.1% vomiting. Overall, approximately 
25% of the TEAEs were considered related to study treatment. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported 
most frequently in the SOCs of GI Disorders for PA21 and Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders for 
Phoslyra. Incidence of treatment-related TEAEs of diarrhoea was most frequently observed for 
Velphoro (16.7%), while incidence of treatment-related hypercalcaemia (21.1%), was the most 
frequently observed treatment-related adverse event in the Phoslyra group. The adverse event profile 
for patients with CKD, but not on dialysis (15 patients, 60% Stage 1 and 80% Stage 2) does not 
suggest for any substantial differences in safety compared to patients on dialysis (65% Stage 1 and 
75% Stage 2).  
Although serious TEAEs were frequently reported and higher in the Velphoro group than with Phoslyra 
(18 (27.3%) vs 3 (15.8%)), only five serious GI TEAEs were considered treatment related; 3 subjects 
in the Velphoro group: one subject with ileus and one subject with gastritis during stage 1 and one 
Assessment report

Page 74/84 
 
 
 
subject with blood pressure increased/hypertension/vena cava thrombosis during stage 2; and 2 
subjects in the Phoslyra group: small intestinal perforation and vomiting. For the Velphoro serious 
adverse events, all events resolved during the study. In other cases, Velphoro was only temporarily 
interrupted in one case and treatment was maintained in the other case, which is sufficiently 
reassuring. Any case of gastro-intestinal perforation has not been observed with Velphoro, which is 
reassuring, but data are limited to detect such rare cases. No adverse events leading to death were 
reported in either treatment group, which is reassuring. 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs were lower in the Velphoro group (12 (18.2%) subjects) than in the 
Phoslyra group (6 (31.6%) subjects). Reasons for discontinuations appears to be slightly different, with 
GI symptoms being the most prominent reason for discontinuation in Velphoro patients (diarrhoea (6 
subjects), nausea (2 subjects) and vomiting (2 subjects)), and metabolism disorders (hypercalcaemia 
(3 subjects) and hyperphosphatemia (2 subjects)) in the Phoslyra group, although data were limited.  
There were no new concerns or signals with regard to the TEAEs of special interest for Velphoro used 
in the paediatric population: diarrhoea (as expected), potential iron overload (none), potential masking 
of GI bleeding (none), and deficiencies in growth and skeletal development or abnormalities of bone 
markers (e.g., fractures: none), or Phoslyra: hypercalcemia (as expected). 
No dose-relationship between dose and incidence of adverse events could be observed. However, this 
would be difficult to establish, as dose-adjustments and titration were done frequently based on 
efficacy, therefore making it difficult to know the exact dose at which the adverse events occurred. 
Also, subjects on higher doses should be expected to tolerate the drug better.  
Some changes from baseline and individual shifts relative to normal ranges were observed for clinical 
laboratory parameters including routine haematology and chemistry, liver enzymes, iron status 
parameters, vitamins and bone markers, but showed no trends or clinically relevant changes. 
Hypercalcemia is mainly observed in calcium-based phosphate binders; accordingly, as expected,  
incidence of sustained hypercalcaemia was higher in the Phoslyra group than in the Velphoro group. As 
in the studies in adults, results for serum phosphorus showed decreases from baseline for up to 34 
weeks in the Velphoro group (the intended clinical effect) while fluctuation relative to baseline was 
observed in the Phoslyra group. No trends or clinically relevant changes were observed for other 
clinical laboratory values or vital signs in both treatment groups. 
Supportive study (external control) 
As a request of the PDCO, an additional comparison was made with an external control from paediatric 
Study SVCARB07609, a Phase 2 study conducted with sevelamer carbonate (SC) in CKD patients with 
hyperphosphataemia. Sevelamer is approved for use in children >6 years. There were several 
limitations to this comparison due to differences in study design, like the age of the population, 
unequal durations of the study periods and the different methods of summarising the reported events.  
Frequencies of TEAEs overall and of SAEs could be considered roughly comparable between the 
Velphoro and sevelamer; however, besides the limitations in design, also detailed safety data are not 
available. 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were more frequent for Velphoro and Phoslyra than for 
sevelamer (or comparator group). The most frequent TEAEs on leading to study discontinuation were 
related to the known safety profile: for Velphoro GI symptoms and for Phoslyra metabolism disorders. 
For sevelamer, TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were related to the underlying condition of 
hyperphosphatemia. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial are included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD was generally comparable 
to that previously observed in adult ESRD subjects, particularly with respect to gastrointestinal AEs, 
including diarrhoea. No new or unexpected safety signals were identified during the conduct of this 
study in the paediatric and adolescent population compared to the adult population. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
There are no safety concerns remaining for this product. During parallel procedures X/10 and II/21, 
the company provided sufficient justification to remove all safety concerns. In line with GVP V rev2, the 
original missing information does not have an impact on the benefit risk of the product and can 
therefore be removed. The original important and potential risks were removed from the safety 
specification after the submission of the results from the study VERIFIE suggested that their frequency, 
severity and transient occurrence were similar to those seen in clinical trials. Further characterisation 
as part of additional pharmacovigilance activities is unlikely, therefore, these risks are considered to be 
sufficiently characterised and can be removed from the risk management plan.  
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 9.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Velphoro is an iron-based phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in adult patients 
with (severe) chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
The following additional indication is claimed for Velphoro: 
“Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with 
CKD on dialysis.” 
Hyperphosphatemia is common in patients with (severe) CKD due to the inability to excrete dietary 
phosphorus, particularly those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis. Dietary 
phosphate restriction is generally not sufficient to compensate for hyperphosphatemia and particularly 
challenging in children, also considering the general need for nutrients for growth and development. 
Besides, intensification of dialysis may also be too demanding for young children. Hyperphosphatemia 
plays an important role in the pathophysiology of major CKD complications, such as secondary 
hyperparathyroidism, mineral and bone disorder (MBD) and cardiovascular disease and is considered a 
risk factor for mortality, morbidity and hospitalisation in patients with ESRD. Complications most 
relevant to the paediatric population are renal bone disease, cardiovascular disease and growth failure.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In adults with CKD and on dialysis, several phosphate binders are currently available for treating 
hyperphosphatemia. Calcium salts are widely used. Newer PB products include sevelamer HCl, 
sevelamer carbonate and lanthanum carbonate. 
Phosphate binding takes place by ligand exchange between hydroxyl groups and/or water and the 
phosphate ions throughout the physiological pH range of the gastrointestinal tract. Serum phosphorus 
levels are reduced as a consequence of the reduced dietary phosphate absorption. 
In children with advanced CKD, the use of phosphate binders for treatment of hyperphosphatemia is 
widespread, but not all of these substances are approved in this population. To date, calcium-
carbonate and calcium-acetate are both approved for hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients without age 
restriction. Sevelamer powder for oral suspension is approved for children >6 years of age. 
KDIGO and KDOQI guidelines recommend the use of phosphate binders in children with calcium-based 
phosphate binders as the first choice, in addition to dietary management. Hence, with these medicinal 
products is the most experience in children in clinical practice. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In line with PDCO requirements, as stated in the approved PIP, one clinical multicentre, randomised, 
prospective, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled study with Velphoro (n=66) (in comparison to 
Phoslyra calcium acetate (n=19)) was submitted to (1) evaluate the effect for reducing serum 
phosphorus levels in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD stage 4-5 with or without dialysis 
and age-specific hyperphosphatemia and, (2) to introduce a new paediatric formulation of 125 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 77/84 
 
 
 
powder for oral suspension. The study consisted of a dose-titration period of up to 10 weeks (Stage 1), 
and a 24-week safety extension (Stage 2).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint showed a limited non-statistically significant LS mean (SE) difference from 
baseline to end of stage 1 (titration phase) in serum phosphorus levels of -0.120 (0.081) mmol/l (95% 
CI: -0.282, 0.043) in the PA21 treatment group (n=65) based on the mixed model calculations with 
actual data showing a mean of 2.08 mmol/L at baseline and 1.91 mmol/L at the end of stage 1 
(reduction by 0.17 mmol/L). The effect was maintained during the follow-up period (stage 2), although 
some fluctuations in mean effect over time were noticed (0.099 (0.198) mmol/L (95% CI -0.306, 
0.504). The observed decrease in serum phosphorus levels resulted in an increase from 17% of the 
patients being within the normal range at baseline to 61% at the end of stage 1 and was maintained at 
58% at the end of stage 2. Also, patients did not exceed the maximum age-specific daily dosing 
scheme as mentioned in the study protocol. 
For the approximately 20% of the children who were not on dialysis, a clinical relevant treatment effect 
in patients not on dialysis comparable to dialysis patients has been observed (i.e. the total proportion 
of patients in the normal range was greater in the patients not on dialysis than for the dialysis patients 
both at Stage 1 (80% vs 57%) and during the maintenance phase Stage 2 (73% vs 55%)). Also, 
dosing applied appears not to deviate substantially from the dialysis group and thus dose 
recommendations can be similar (the average daily dose was 1742mg the not on dialysis group vs 
1890 mg in the dialysis group). 
When Velphoro pediatric data are compared to pediatric data of Phoslyra, comparable efficacy was 
shown. Based on the indirect comparison with pediatric data of a historical sevelamer study, data were 
variable across age-groups and did not show large differences between both medicinal products. 
Furthermore, the use of the new formulation of 125 mg powder for oral suspension can be acceptable 
and meets, in general, the quality requirements and facilitates dose recommendations according to 
study and labeling recommendations, especially for the youngest children.  
Palatability and acceptability of the formulations used in the study were generally scored as good for 
Velphoro and similar to better than Phoslyra. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The two-arm controlled study was not adequately powered to make an adequate comparison with 
Phoslyra (calcium actetate) and numbers of patients included were limited to provide clear findings to 
evaluate the effect for reducing serum phosphorus levels in paediatric and adolescent subjects with 
CKD stage 4-5 with or without dialysis and age-specific hyperphosphatemia. The number of the 
patients randomized in the study, however, is in line with what has been agreed by PDCO/EMA, to 
reduce the required minimum numbers of recruited subjects to at least 60 subjects to be randomized 
into the Velphoro group. Also, indirect comparison with sevelamer (as requested by PDCO) should be 
handled with caution due to study differences and small study numbers. 
In general, the effect observed in this pediatric study is substantially lower than observed in adults, in 
whom levels were reduced by 0.7 mmol/L (section 5.1 SmPC Velphoro). The response rates of children 
in the current study showed, however, generally similar rates within the target range compared to 
adult data (58% end of the study in normal range paediatrics; adult at the normal range is 45.3% at 
week 12 and 51.9% at week 52). 
The effect for the primary endpoint (change of serum phosphorus levels from baseline to stage 1) 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 78/84 
 
 
 
appears not to be consistent across several subgroups, but data are limited. With regards to age 
subgroups, although the youngest age group of ≥2-<6 years was small (n=6), they showed an effect 
change (LS mean) of -0.078 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.468, 0312). This effect was lower compared to older 
pediatric patients (-0.200 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.541, 0,141) in children ≥6 to <12 years and -0.149 
mmol/L (95% CI: -0.274, -0.023), p=0.020 in children ≥12 to <18 years), despite the relatively high 
baseline serum phosphorus levels mean of 2.37 mmol/L in the youngest age group compared to 2.24 
mmol/L in the ≥6 to <12 years old children and 1.98 mmol/L in the oldest group of children of ≥12 to 
<18 years of age.  
An inconsistent reduction was also observed in females compared to males (-0.177 mmol/l vs -
0.026 mmol/l), in US patients compared to non-US patients (-0.214 mmol/l vs -0.060 mmol/l), and in 
subjects who were prescribed sachets only (n=10, -0.232 mmol/l) or both formulations (n=10, -0.166 
mmol/l) compared to those prescribed tablets only (n=46, -0.032 mmol/l). However, data are too 
limited to draw any appropriate conclusions. Furthermore, as expected, subjects whose serum 
phosphorus levels were above age-related normal ranges at baseline serum phosphorus levels showed 
a statistically significant reduction (n=40, -0.282 mmol/l p=0.0058), while no significant change was 
observed among subjects whose baseline phosphorus level was within or below normal ranges (n=25; 
0.082 mmol/l). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In line with the currently known safety profile as included in the product information for adults, most 
commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (33% treatment-
related) including diarrhoea (16.7%), vomiting (6.1%), gastritis (3.0%) and discoloured faeces 
(3.0%). Diarrhoea was mostly mild and occurred mostly during the first weeks of treatment initiation.  
Serious TEAEs were generally observed with a high-frequency n=13 (19.7%) during Stage 1 and 
during the overall study (18 (27.3%) vs 3 (15.8%)). However, only 5 serious TEAEs (in 3 subjects) 
were considered related to study treatment (gastritis, ileus, blood pressure increased hypertension, 
and vena cava thrombosis (last 3 in one subject)) and did not result in study discontinuation, with only 
one case of temporary treatment interruption. No fatal events were reported during the study. 
The adverse event profile for patients with CKD, but not on dialysis (approximately 20%) does not 
suggest for any substantial differences in safety, compared to patients on dialysis. 
Like in previous studies in adults, discontinuation rates were high (16.7%), with GI symptoms as most 
prominent reason for discontinuation in Velphoro patients (diarrhoea (6 subjects), nausea (2 subjects) 
and vomiting (2 subjects)).  
Hypercalcemia was only reported in 9.1% subjects, while no trends or clinically relevant changes were 
observed for the other clinical laboratory parameters. 
Despite the small number of patients, comparison with Phoslyra (calcium acetate) showed some 
differences in the type of AEs reported due to the nature of the two compounds (iron-containing and 
calcium-containing). Differences mainly included more common GI adverse events for Velphoro and 
more hypercalcemia for Phoslyra. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Percentages of total TEAEs and serious TEAEs were slightly higher in subjects ≥6 to <12 years 
compared to the other age groups. TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation were highest in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/522604/2020  
Page 79/84 
 
 
 
youngest age group (n=2), but no serious TEAEs were reported, although the number of patients in 
the youngest age group (≥2-<6 years of age) was very limited (N=6). 
No dose effect was observed on the safety data but the interpretation is difficult as most patients 
started treatment at different doses, dose-adjustments were made during the study (up and down 
titration), and the dose was based on age and weight. Some patients were below the age appropriate 
starting dose at the end of the study. However, dose titration limitations due to AEs were rarely 
observed.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Maintaining patients within a serum phosphorus level within the normal ranges of phosphorus is 
considered of clinical relevance to potentially reduce morbidity and mortality, as best demonstrated for 
adults. During the possible several years of treatment, it is at least considered important that children 
do no become markedly dysregulated until their transplantation. In the current study, a limited effect 
of Velphoro on the decrease in serum phosphorus levels has been observed in the paediatric population 
and a new paediatric formulation of 125 mg powder for oral suspension was introduced. The limited 
treatment effect (which is also smaller than hypothesized) may be due to a mean phosphorus baseline 
level only marginally higher than the target level with even a substantial proportion already at normal 
level (and thus no inherent need for substantial phosphorus lowering), as a result of the study design 
and conduct. Compliance issues, intra-patient variability and perhaps suboptimal titration may have 
been other reason, among other unidentified reasons. Despite the marginal effect, a large proportion 
of patients was within the age-adjusted normal phosphorus range after treatment, comparable to that 
observed for adults, which thus can be considered clinically relevant. Moreover, based on the local 
mechanism of action, any differences in effect to adults is not to be expected. Further, the treatment 
effect of Velphoro in children is approximately comparable with the treatment effect seen in children on 
other phosphate binders (Phoslyra and in historical control data of sevelamer), although such 
comparisons are subject to limitations.  
The safety profile of Velphoro in paediatric and adolescent subjects with CKD, including those not on 
dialysis, was generally comparable to that previously observed in adult subjects. It is mainly 
characterised by gastrointestinal adverse events, including diarrhoea, starting at the initiation of 
therapy and potentially compromising long term treatment and treatment compliance. Frequencies of 
serious adverse events were limited and did not importantly compromise treatment continuation. 
Intestinal perforation or any suggestion for GI bleeding was not observed; however, the database was 
far too limited to detect such rate events. Further, hypercalcemia was infrequent with Velphoro, which 
may be an advantage when the risk for hypercalcemia can be expected and thus guideline-
recommended calcium-based phosphate binders for younger patients may be less appropriate. Overall, 
no new or unexpected safety signals were identified during the conduct of this study in the paediatric 
and adolescent population compared to the adult population.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall decrease in serum phosphorus levels observed in the paediatric population was small but 
clinically relevant mainly in terms of responder rates. The safety profile of Velphoro in children is 
acceptable. The use of the new formulation of 125 mg powder for oral suspension can also be 
acceptable for both paediatric and adult patients and meets the quality requirements. The choice of the 
new formulation will depend on patient’s age, preference, characteristics and compliance.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Velphoro in the indication “control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 
2 years of age and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 
m2) or with CKD on dialysis” and for the paediatric formulation of the 125 mg powder for oral 
suspension is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of, Velphoro 125 mg powder for oral suspension is favourable in the 
following indications: 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
Velphoro is indicated for the control of serum phosphorus levels in paediatric patients 2 years of age 
and older with CKD stages 4-5 (defined by a glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or with 
CKD on dialysis. 
Velphoro should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include 
calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 or one of its analogues, or calcimimetics to control the 
development of renal bone disease. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Velphoro subject to 
the following conditions:

agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma 
France, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and 
considers that the new therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with 
existing therapies 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0196/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning 
the following changes:

rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) or with CKD on dialysis, based on the results from an open-label, 
randomised, active-controlled, parallel group, multicentre, phase 3 study investigating the safety and 
efficacy of Velphoro and calcium acetate in paediatric and adolescent CKD patients with 
hyperphosphataemia (Study PA-CL-PED-01). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. The RMP version 
9.0 is also agreed. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1.

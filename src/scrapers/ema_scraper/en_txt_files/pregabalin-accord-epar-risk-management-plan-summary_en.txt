the risks 
Important risks of Pregabalin Accord 25mg / 50mg / 75mg / 100mg / 150mg / 200mg / 225mg and 
300mg hard capsules, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for

and 300mg hard capsules’ risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 
  Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed including PSUR assessment (if applicable) and signal management activity, so 
that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.

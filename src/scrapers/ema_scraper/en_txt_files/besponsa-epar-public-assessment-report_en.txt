1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Limited submitted on 14 April 2016 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for BESPONSA, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 
3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 November 2014.  
BESPONSA was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1127 on 7 June 2013 in the following 
condition: ‘Treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia’. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
‘BESPONSA is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)’. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Besponsa as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
inotuzumab ozogamicin was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0304/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and a product-specific waiver. At the 
time of the submission of the application, the PIP P/0304/2014 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
ALL represents approximately 20% of leukaemias among adults and 80% of acute leukaemias in children 
(Jabbour et al., 2005).   In Europe, the crude incidence rate of ALL is 1.3 per 100,000 individuals (Sant et 
al., 2010). The B-cell subtype accounts for approximately 75% of ALL cases in adults and approximately 88% 
of cases in children (NCCN Guidelines, 2015). 
The median age of diagnosis for ALL is 14 years, with approximately 58% of patients diagnosed before the 
age of 20 years. By contrast, approximately 26% of cases are diagnosed after 45 years of age, and 
approximately 11% of patients are diagnosed after 65 years of age (Howlader et al., 2015).  
Overall, approximately 20%-30% of adult patients with ALL are Ph+, with the incidence exceeding 50% in 
patients aged 50 years or older (Jabbour et al., 2015, Thomas DA, 2007).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous haematologic disease characterized by the 
proliferation of immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and other organs resulting in 
loss of normal haematopoiesis and organ failure leading to death if left untreated (Jabbour et al., 2005). 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 9/133 
 
  
  
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical presentation of ALL and the signs and symptoms of recurrence are typically nonspecific and may 
include fatigue, lethargy, constitutional symptoms (fevers, night sweats, weight loss), dyspnoea, dizziness, 
infections, and easy bruising or bleeding (Faderl et al.,  2010,  Jabbour et al., 2005).  The presence of 
lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly on physical examination is found in approximately 20% of 
patients. The initial diagnosis of ALL requires demonstration of ≥20% bone marrow lymphoblasts.  Patients 
diagnosed with B-cell ALL in routine clinical practice undergo  screening for CD22 at their local laboratory. 
Cure rates and survival outcomes for B-cell ALL have improved over the last decades, mainly in children and 
young adults who are treated according to paediatric protocols. Advances in the understanding of the 
molecular genetics have led to the adoption of risk adapted therapy and novel targeted agents have been 
developed. About 20-30% of B-cell precursor ALL is Ph+ and the development of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors has markedly improved prognosis. There is general agreement that for Ph+ ALL a myeloablative 
allogeneic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in first complete remission is the most appropriate therapy for both 
children and adults who are sufficiently fit and have a well-matched donor.  
However prognosis remains poor in adult patients. Older adults have the poorest outcome with a 5-year OS 
rate of 24.1% for patients between the ages of 40 and 59 and an even lower rate of 17.7% for patients 
between the ages of 60 and 69 (Pulte et al. ,2014). Despite the high remission rates with first line therapy, 
only approximately 30 to 40% of adults achieve long-term disease-free survival, with the primary reason for 
failure being disease recurrence. Particular unfavourable prognostic factors include high leucocyte count 
(>30,000/µL), late haematological remission (>3 weeks after induction II), complex aberrant karyotype or 
molecular aberrations (Philadelphia chromosome positive [t9;22] or t4;11) and high minimal residual disease 
level after early consolidation ( Moorman et al., 2007; Bruggemann et al. ,2006). Risk of relapse is highest in 
the first two years after achievement of complete remission. The median survival time in adults with relapsed 
or refractory B-cell ALL is approximately 3-6 months (O'Brien et al., 2008, Thomas et al., 1999). 
2.1.5.  Management 
There is no standard treatment for relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) ALL and a 
variety of chemotherapy induction regimens, including high dose cytarabine, hyper CVAD (hyper-
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone) and fludarabine/cytarabine/GCSF are 
administered.  
Recently, Blincyto (blinatumomab), a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody, has been approved for 
the treatment of adults with Ph- relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL.  
For Ph+ patients, imatinib (Glivec) was approved in 2001 for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients 
with newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL integrated with chemotherapy. Dasatinib (Sprycel) was approved in 2006 for 
the treatment of adult patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib (Iclusig) was 
approved in 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with Ph+ ALL who are resistant to/ intolerant of 
dasatinib.  
About the product 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of a CD22 directed monoclonal 
antibody that is covalently linked to N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. Inotuzumab is a 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 10/133 
 
  
  
 
humanised immunoglobulin class G subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody that specifically recognises human CD22. The 
small molecule, N acetyl gamma calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic product.  N acetyl gamma calicheamicin is 
covalently attached to the antibody via an acid-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer 
activity of inotuzumab ozogamicin is due to the binding of the ADC to CD22 expressing tumour cells, followed 
by internalisation of the ADC-CD22 complex, and the intracellular release of N acetyl gamma calicheamicin 
dimethylhydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of the linker. Activation of N acetyl gamma calicheamicin 
dimethylhydrazide induces double-stranded DNA breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and 
apoptotic cell death (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: Besponsa is indicated for the treatment of 
adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: Besponsa is indicated as monotherapy for 
the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL). Adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) relapsed or refractory B cell 
precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (SmPC section 4.1). 
For patients proceeding to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the recommended duration of 
treatment is 2 cycles. A third cycle could be considered for those patients who do not achieve a complete 
remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) and minimal residual 
disease (MRD) negativity after 2 cycles (see section 4.4). For patients not proceeding to HSCT, additional 
cycles of treatment, up to a maximum of 6 cycles, may be administered. Patients who do not achieve a 
CR/CRi within 3 cycles should discontinue treatment. 
For the first cycle, the recommended total dose of BESPONSA for all patients is 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle, given 
as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2). Cycle 1 is 3 weeks in 
duration, but may be extended to 4 weeks if the patient achieves a CR or CRi, and/or to allow recovery from 
toxicity. 
For subsequent cycles, the recommended total dose of BESPONSA is 1.5 mg/m2 per cycle given as 3 divided 
doses on Days 1 (0.5 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for patients who achieve a CR/CRi or 1.8 
mg/m2 per cycle given as 3 divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) for 
patients who do not achieve a CR/CRi. Subsequent cycles are 4 weeks in duration (SmPC, section 4.2). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment based on the following 
grounds: 
It was not considered that sufficient data have been submitted to substantiate the request for accelerated 
assessment of inotuzumab ozogamicin. It was not certain that the data from studies intended to be 
submitted show a significant and meaningful clinical benefit over approved treatments in this setting. The 
incidence of hepatic VOD requires careful assessment and possibly follow-up in the post-authorisation 
setting. Overall survival data would be required before inotuzumab ozogamicin can be considered of major 
interest from the point of view of public health and therapeutic innovation.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin consists of a recombinant, humanized, IgG4 antibody covalently bonded to a semi-
synthetic derivative of gamma calicheamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a conjugate of the two 
intermediates: inotuzumab and the activated calicheamicin derivative.  
The antibody chosen for development of inotuzumab was selected to target CD22 expressed on B cells 
involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  
Calicheamicin is a potent cytotoxin that, once conjugated to the anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, allows 
target directed therapy. The calicheamicin is bound to the antibody via a linker which forms an amide bond 
with the antibody and forms a disulfide bond with the calicheamicin. The linker also contains an internal 
hydrazone bond, which is acid-labile. 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Division of Wyeth Holdings Corporation, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., Pearl River, NY, 
USA, is responsible for the manufacture, testing, and storage of the active substance inotuzumab ozogamicin 
and of the finished product, Besponsa. The MAH is Pfizer Limited, Sandwich UK.

In the manufacture of Besponsa two separate intermediate materials are used, the activated calicheamicin 
derivative and the monoclonal antibody inotuzumab (G544 antibody).  
The manufacture, characterisation, control and stability of the two intermediates (the activated 
calicheamicin derivative and inotuzumab (G544 antibody)) and the active substance inotuzumab 
ozogamicin are described below in three separate sections. 
Intermediate activated calicheamicin 
General Information (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
Full characterisation using various methods including  infrared radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV), mass 
spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has been carried out. The results 
demonstrate that the activated calicheamicin derivative has the expected structure. The activated 
calicheamicin derivative is a white to off white powder, amorphous solid, exhibits no crystalline properties, 
hygroscopic and is not soluble in water or aqueous solutions.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
Starting from  a working cell  bank,  fermentation  of  M. echinospora  strain  produces  -calicheamicin,  which is 
isolated  as  a  solution  in  the  antifoam  used  in  the  fermentation.  The  -calicheamicin  solution  is  used  to 
produce N-acetyl calicheamicin. Lastly, the activated linker is added to N-acetyl calicheamicin to produce the 
intermediate activated calicheamicin derivative: 
The activated calicheamicin intermediate is transferred into glass bottles prior to drying and subsequent 
storage at the recommended storage temperature. 
Control of Materials (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
Information regarding the starting materials for the synthesis of the intermediate activated calicheamicin are 
provided. Sufficient information is provided about the cell banking system used and regarding testing of

Control of critical steps and intermediates (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The control strategy, critical attributes, critical process parameters, acceptance ranges of the manufacturing 
process of the activated calicheamicin derivative, including its purification and isolation have been discussed. 
Acceptable Ranges have been set for each process parameter/ in-process tests (critical and non-critical).  
Process validation (Intermediate activated calicheamicin) 
The process validation of the calicheamicin oil, N-acetyl calicheamicin, and activated calicheamicin derivative 
manufacturing processes has been completed.  Process validation results demonstrate product and process 
control, as well as effectiveness and consistency of the manufacturing processes.

Intermediate inotuzumab 
General Information (Intermediate inotuzumab) 
Inotuzumab is an IgG4 kappa monoclonal antibody with two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light 
(L) chains, covalently linked with four inter-chain disulfide bonds.   
The N-linked glycosylation consensus sequence, NST, in the CH2 region is essentially fully occupied with 
asialo, core-fucosylated, complex-type biantennary oligosaccharides with zero and one terminal galactose 
residues, abbreviated as G0F and G1F, respectively. The C-terminal K is encoded by the H chain expression 
vector cDNA sequence, but is observed only at low levels in the mature, secreted form of inotuzumab, 
presumably due to processing by CHO cellular proteases. Therefore, the penultimate G residue is the 
predominant H chain C-terminus in inotuzumab. The theoretical molecular masses of the predominant N-
linked glycoforms, assuming C-terminal G residues in both H chains, and full disulfide bond connectivity, are 
on average 14.9 KDa. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls (Intermediate inotuzumab) 
The inotuzumab intermediate manufacturing process has been adequately described.  
The manufacturing process for inotuzumab intermediate uses a recombinant CHO cell line that contains the 
DNA encoding the sequence for inotuzumab. Cells from the WCB are thawed, and the culture is progressively 
expanded. The culture is then harvested and clarified to remove cells and debris. After this harvest step, the 
product is processed by chromatographic steps and membrane filtration steps. The ranges of critical process 
parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria are described for each step. 
The inotuzumab intermediate manufacturing process is considered acceptable.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product Besponsa is a lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1 
mg/vial of inotuzumab ozogamicin. The excipients are: tromethamine (buffer), sucrose (cryoprotectant, 
bulking agent), polysorbate 80 (surfactant) and sodium chloride (tonicifier). All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. After reconstitution with 4 mL of (sterile) water for 
injection, the concentration of the finished product is 0.25 mg/mL inotuzumab ozogamicin. The finished 
product is packaged in a 20 mL amber glass vial. The finished product contains no preservative and is for 
single use only. No solvent is provided with the product. 
An appropriate description of the pharmaceutical development has been submitted.  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is sensitive to light exposure. An amber glass container is utilized for light protection 
during packaging and storage of the finished product. The commercial lyophilized product primary container 
is a 20 mL amber vial with a rubber stopper closure and aluminum flip-off seal. The secondary container, 
which is a carton, additionally limits light exposure.  
Besponsa is administered as an IV infusion, which must be completed within 8 hours from start of 
reconstitution to end of infusion. Upon reconstitution, the Besponsa can be used immediately or refrigerated 
at 2-8 °C. Following dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride, the Besponsa solution can be infused immediately, 
held at room temperature, or refrigerated at 2- 8 °C. If stored refrigerated, equilibrate to room temperature 
for one hour prior to infusion and infuse immediately. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Besponsa 1 mg/vial finished product is as follows. The inotuzumab ozogamicin 
active substance is supplied as a frozen liquid. The frozen active substance is thawed under controlled 
conditions, mixed and then filtered into a container. The formulation buffer is then added to the mixed active 
substance to dilute the protein concentration to 0.25 mg/mL. The formulated finished product is then sterile 
filtered and aseptically filled into vials. Upon completion of the lyophilization cycle, the vials are stoppered 
and capped with an overseal. Following the capping operation, the vials are visually inspected and stored at 
2-8 °C. The lyophilzation process has been adequately documented, and suitable process controls including 
CPPs have been set.   
Product specification 
The specifications for Besponsa at release include tests for the following quality attributes: characteristics, 
identity, purity, biological activity, product related impurities and safety.  
Except for reconstitution time and container closure system, the methods are either compendial or the same 
as used for control of the active ingredient. Descriptions and validation for the methods for reconstitution 
time and container closure integrity have been submitted. The specification limits in accordance with clinical 
experience are acceptable.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
The batch analyses data of the finished product lots used for non-clinical, clinical trials, stability and process 
validation met the specifications at the time of release and additionally, the process validation lots also met 
the commercial specifications. 
Reference materials 
Reference standards are described in the active substance section. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) finished product is 24 months when stored at 
recommended temperature of 2-8 °C.  
Stability information for inotuzumab ozogamicin finished product stored under recommended 2-8 °C 
conditions has been provided. All primary finished product stability lots were manufactured with the 
commercial active substance. All test results at the recommended storage conditions met the commercial 
specifications As more stability data becomes available, the Applicant expects to extend the shelf life based 
on the suitability of the data. 
Adventitious agents 
The viral testing of unprocessed bulk is in line with what is expected for material derived from Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is considered acceptable. 
The virus validation studies are acceptable in terms of number of validated steps and model viruses used and 
effective reduction of A-MuLV, Reo 3 and PPV is indicated by the results. Validation reports are be provided 
for each study of virus reduction.  
The establishment of MCB and WCB have been set up in AHO free conditions.. 
All materials are sourced and manufactured consistent with the current industry guidelines including those 
from the EMA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) for 
minimizing the risk of transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), including bovine 
spongiform encephalopathies (BSE). The risk with TSE is considered negligible. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Four major objections were initially identified during the marketing authorisation application procedure. The 
first major objection pertained to the description of the manufacturing process for all three parts of the active 
substance as it was considered not to be sufficiently detailed to assure that future commercial batches will be 
representative for the validation batches and batches that has been used in clinical trials. During the 
procedure the applicant has provided the necessary level of detail required. As the QP declaration originally 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 19/133 
 
  
  
 
 
submitted with the application was based upon audits carried out by Regulatory Authorities, major objection 
2 requested a new QP declaration covering all relevant active substance manufacturing sites, independently 
audited on behalf of the proposed MIAH. A satisfactory QP declaration for the active substance was provided 
to address the second major objection. The third major objection highlighted that the GMP certificate, issued 
by in July 2015 by the MHRA, did not cover some Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Pearl River buildings used in the 
manufacture of Besponsa; hence; a new inspection was required. A new valid GMP certificate, following an 
inspection of the buildings used in the manufacture of Besponsa in Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Pearl River was 
provided and resolved major objection 3. The fourth major objection was related to the fact that the 
acceptance criteria applied in the specification of the finished product was set without taking clinical 
qualification into account and are in many cases considerably less stringent compared to the clinical batches. 
The applicant clinically justified and/or tightened the acceptance criteria, which was acceptable. Hence all the 
major abjections were resolved.  
2.2.5.  Conclusion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product, as updated during the procedure, is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the 
uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All studies (toxicity, reproductive and developmental, genetic toxicity and tissue cross-reactivity) were 
conducted in accordance with US FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. Safety studies were 
performed in accordance with GLP. The in vitro hERG assay with N-Ac-У-calicheamicin DMH was not GLP 
compliant but this did not affect the safety assessment. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
The binding of inotuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated antibody (G544) to human CD22 was evaluated by 
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using human CD22-Fc fusion protein (RPT-44320). Both inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and unconjugated G544 antibody bound human CD22 with similar affinities by Biacore analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 20/133 
 
  
  
 
Competitive blocking studies showed that the G544 antibody-binding site on CD22 was localized to the first 
Ig-like domain of CD22, known as CD22 epitope A/ Ig-like domain 1 of CD22 (Report –RPT-48437).  
The cell surface expression of CD20 and CD22 was shown to be lower in Reh and RS4;11 ALL cell lines 
compared to Ramos B-cell lymphoma cells. The pre-B ALL cell line SUP-B15 did not demonstrate readily-
detectable expression of CD-20 or CD22. As expected, B-cell ALL cell lines expressed undetectable or only 
negligible levels of CD33 (Report 145820). 
Specific binding of PE-labeled G544 was detected in normal human B-cells. Binding of G544-PE to B-cells 
from mouse, rat, rabbit, or cynomolgus monkey was not observed in these experiments. Furthermore, 
staining was not detected in granulocytes, monocytes, or T-cells in whole blood from any nonclinical species 
examined (Report 145201). 
The internalization and trafficking of G544 was evaluated using imaging flow cytometry (Amnis) after binding 
to CD22-positive B-ALL (Reh, RS4;11) or the B-cell Lymphoma (Ramos) cell lines. The constant exposure 
method was used to assess the internalization rate of G544. The internalization score (IS) and membrane 
and cytosolic intensity for each sample was determined using Amnis IDEAS software. To determine the 
internalization rate, the IS and cytosolic intensity were plotted versus time and nonlinear regression was 
used to derive a half-time (t½) when a saturable response with time was observed (Report 115037). 
Co-localization of G544 antibody with Lysosymal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) was detected in 
the CD22-positive Ramos, Reh and RS4;11 cell lines (Report  115037). 
The effect of inotuzumab ozogamicin on 53BP1 foci formation was  tested in CD22-positive Reh ALL cells. 
Short-term (1 hour) incubation with inotuzumab ozogamicin caused  induction of 53BP1 foci formation in the 
nuclei of most cells, indicative of DNA damage. These data suggest that inotuzumab ozogamicin elicits its 
anti-tumor activity due to the  calicheamicin payload causing DNA damage (Report 145820). 
The ability of  inotuzumab ozogamicin and unconjugated G544 antibody to induce CDC and to mediate  ADCC 
was evaluated with CD20-positive, CD22-positive Ramos B-lymphoma cells. In contrast to the IgG1 
expressing anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, neither the G544 antibody nor the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
conjugate showed effector functions in the CDC and ADCC assays. This is in line with known lack of CDC and 
ADCC effector function for IgG4 antibodies (Report RPT-51502). 
Cell viability studies using a colorimetric assay were conducted with ALL (Reh, RS4;11, SUP-B15) and 
lymphoma (Ramos) cell lines. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranged from 0.33 (Reh 
cells) to 2.5 ng/ml (Ramos cells). The nonbinding control gemtuzumab ozogamicin was up to 63-fold less 
cytotoxic against the CD22-positive cell line tested. All CD22-positive cell lines tested displayed increased 
sensitivity (75 to 564-fold) towards the cytotoxic effect of inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to control CD33-
positive HL-60 cells, which do not express CD22 (Report 145820). 
In vivo studies 
Tolerability was studied in nude and SCID mice after three IP injections of inotuzumab ozogamicin every four 
days. The maximum non-lethal dose (MND) of inotuzumab ozogamicin in non-tumorbearing nude mice was 
9.87 mg/m2 (Report-44320) and in SCID mice 3.3 mg/m2 (Report RPT-51502). 
A B-ALL Reh SC xenograft model with tumor cells implanted in irradiated, athymic nude mice was utilized to 
study the antitumor activity of inotuzumab ozogamicin. The study included the antibody drug conjugate 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017

gemtuzumab ozogamicin, where the antibody recognized CD33, another B-cell marker. Compared to vehicle-
treated mice, both inotuzumab ozogamicin and gemtuzumab ozogamicin significantly (p <0.05) inhibited 
tumor growth from day 20 onward. The control compound, gemtuzumab ozogamicin at the dose of 13.71 
mg/m2 was significantly less potent compared to inotuzumab ozogamicin administered at 6.57 mg/m2. The 
mixture of G544 antibody (9 mg/m2) and unconjugated N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH (160 μg/kg) administered 
IP Q4Dx3 was ineffective in inhibiting the growth of Reh xenografts and was associated with treatment-
related deaths of all (6/6) tumor-bearing mice (Report PF-05208773). 
The ability of inotuzumab ozogamicin to protect SCID mice against systemically disseminated Reh B-ALL was 
examined.  Mice dosed with vehicle (PBS) developed hind-limb paralysis and all of these vehicle-treated mice 
died due to the disseminated disease by day 77. Inotuzumab ozogamicin administered at a dose of 3.3 
mg/m2 resulted in 100% survival of treated mice over the 127 day observation period. At a 20-fold lower 
dose (0.18 mg/m2), 90% of the mice survived throughout the observation period (Report 190248). 
Flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow cells collected from the femur of treated mice showed a 75% 
reduction in the engraftment of the human CD45-positive leukemic cells in inotuzumab ozogamicin-treated 
mice (Report 190248). 
The antitumor efficacy of single-agent inotuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in aggressive Ramos and RL 
models of B-cell lymphoma in nude mice. Ramos is a Burkitt’s lymphoma-derived cell line whereas RL was 
originally derived from a non-Burkitt’s follicular lymphoma. The minimum effective dose (MED) of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in the Ramos model was 0.42 mg/m2. Complete tumor regressions were observed at 6.57 mg/m2 
in Ramos tumors which lasted throughout the study observation period. In contrast, the G544 antibody 
control had little effect on the growth of Ramos B-cell lymphoma. In the RL B-cell lymphoma  model, 
inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment induced dose-dependent regressions of RL xenografts over a 3 week 
period. The MED of inotuzumab ozogamicin in the RL lymphoma model was shown to be 0.81 mg/m2 Q4Dx3. 
The route of administration (IV or IP) did not affect the antitumor activity at any of these three dose levels of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin (Report RPT-44320). 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was shown to be effective in disseminated disease Ramos B-cell lymphoma 
regardless of whether it was administered on day 3 (early disease) or day 9 (advanced disease). The 
disseminated B-cell lymphoma studies in both early disease and advanced disease resulted in the best 
response at 1.65 mg/m2. The most likely explanation for decreased survival of mice at higher dose levels 
compared to lower dose levels in this study is that inotuzumab ozogamicin in the high dose group (6.57 
mg/m2) was administered above the tolerated dose levels for SCID mice (Report RPT-51502). 
The effects of CHOP chemotherapy on the survival of SCID mice bearing disseminated Ramos B-cell 
lymphoma was examined. CHOP treatment had only a minor impact on the development of hind-limb 
paralysis and/or death of SCID mice with disseminated B-cell lymphoma (p >0.05 versus vehicle-treated 
mice). In contrast, inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment almost completely inhibited (p < 0.05 versus vehicle- 
or CHOP-treated mice) growth of disseminated B-cell lymphoma (Report 172726). 
Nude mice implanted with Ramos SC xenografts initially responded to CVP or CHOP therapy and then the 
tumors relapsed within approximately 10 days for CVP and 40 days for CHOP after the initiation of the 
chemotherapy. The relapsed Ramos xenografts were poorly responsive to re-treatment with CVP or CHOP but 
remained responsive and regressed upon treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin (Report PF-05208773 and 
Report 172726).

Concurrent administration of CVP and inotuzumab ozogamicin induced regression of established Ramos 
xenografts and significantly (p <0.05) improved the antitumor activity over chemotherapy or inotuzumab 
ozogamicin treatment alone (Report 172726). 
In contrast to the results in the developing RL tumor model, rituximab had little effect on the growth of 
small, staged lymphoma tumors, while inotuzumab ozogamicin inhibited growth throughout the 40 day 
study. G544 antibody treatment was largely ineffective in inhibiting tumor growth (Report RPT-44320). 
In the developing B-cell lymphoma model, the combination of rituximab and inotuzumab ozogamicin led to a 
statistically significant increase in survival over each of the single agents (p <0.05) (Report RPT-51502). In 
contrast, the combination of inotuzumab ozogamicin and rituximab was not effective against B-cell 
lymphoma xenografts allowed to grow to small, staged tumors of ≥ 0.3 g (Report RPT-48437). Also in the 
disseminated Ramos B-cell lymphoma model, the addition of rituximab to inotuzumab ozogamicin did not 
result in an significant improvement over inotuzumab ozogamicin alone (Report RPT-48437). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin (see discussion 
on non-clinical aspects).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Inotuzumab  ozogamicin  was  evaluated  for potential  effects  on  cardiovascular  (CV),  respiratory,  and  central 
nervous system (CNS) in vivo. In addition, an in vitro hERG current inhibition assay was conducted with N-
Ac-У-calicheamicin DMH.  
The potential for inotuzumab ozogamicin to cause neurofunctional effects was assessed following 
administration of a single IV dose to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Evaluated parameters included mortality, 
general and detailed clinical observations, and assessment of CNS function (functional observational battery 
assessment, measurement of hind limb foot splay, measurement of forelimb and hind limb grip strength, and 
measurement of rectal temperature). Inotuzumab ozogamicin administered IV as a single dose of 0.78, 2.4, 
or 8.46 mg/m2 to male rats had no toxicologically important effects on CNS function (Report RPT-47140) 
The potential effect of inotuzumab ozogamicin on pulmonary function was assessed following administration 
of a single IV dose to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Respiratory function (respiratory rate, tidal volume, and 
derived minute volume) was evaluated using head out plethysmography and evaluations were conducted 
prior to dosing and approximately 0.5, 8, and 24 hours after dosing. Inotuzumab ozogamicin administered IV 
as a single dose of 0.78, 2.4, or 8.46 mg/m2 to male rats did not produce any biologically or toxicologically 
relevant effects on respiratory function (Report RPT-47139). 
The potential for inotuzumab ozogamicin to cause cardiovascular effects was evaluated following 
administration of a single IV dose to conscious cynomolgus monkeys. Daily clinical signs were collected and 
telemetered data consisted of arterial blood pressures (systolic, diastolic, and mean), heart rate, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG; heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QT interval). Heart rate, PR, QRS, and QT were 
measured and the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) was calculated for 3 time points prior to dosing and 
3 time points post dosing from ECG recordings for each animal administered vehicle control and 8.16 mg/m2 
(high dose) of inotuzumab ozogamicin. Single IV doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin were associated with mild

increases in mean arterial blood pressure at ≥1.68 mg/m2. There were no changes in PR, QRS, QT or QTc 
interval duration at a dose of 8.16 mg/m2 (Report RPT-47509). 
The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH on hERG potassium channels was >6.77 μM 
(10,000 ng/mL) (Report N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin-DMHHERG). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin (see 
discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Several assays were developed for an integrated characterization of the PK/TK of inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used for the quantitation of inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
total G544 antibody, unconjugated calicheamicin, and ADA in mouse, rat, rabbit, and/or monkey serum. In 
addition, ELISAs were used for the quantitation of calicheamicin equivalents in rat and dog plasma. Liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays were used for the quantitation of total 
calicheamicin in rat, rabbit, and/or monkey serum.  
Single dose Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in non-tumor bearing and tumor bearing mice after IP 
dosing and in rats and monkeys after IV dosing. The mean PK parameters after a single dose of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in mice, rats and monkeys are presented in Table 1,  
Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.

The tissue distribution of [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents in male Sprague-Dawley rats over the 
time course of 0.083 to 336 hours postdose was evaluated by tissue dissection/combustion and LSC after a 
single IV administration (1.88 mg/m2, 62.8 μCi/kg) of [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin. Distribution of 
[3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents into tissues was limited, with tissue-to-plasma AUCinf ratios 
≤0.6 for all tissues evaluated. These findings were consistent with the small Vss observed in rats, which was 
largely limited to plasma volume. The highest tissue-to-plasma ratios were observed in the liver (0.6), blood 
(0.5), spleen (0.4), lung (0.3), and kidney (0.3). Radioequivalents in brain were <2% of those in plasma, 
suggesting limited distribution of inotuzumab ozogamicin and metabolites across the blood-brain barrier. The 
t½ values for [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin-derived radioactivity were similar in both plasma (73.0 hours) and 
blood (73.4 hours). However, longer retention of [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents was observed 
in all other tissues evaluated relative to plasma, with t½ values ranging from 87.7 hours in skeletal muscle to 
265 hours in the kidney. 
The extent of in vitro binding of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH to mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human 
plasma proteins was determined using equilibrium dialysis at a concentration of 1.8 μM (2660 ng/mL). N-Ac-
γ-calicheamicin DMH was highly bound to plasma proteins in all species evaluated. The geometric mean 
plasma fraction unbound (fu) was 0.000942, 0.00679, 0.0263, 0.0310, and 0.0279 in mouse, rat, rabbit, 
monkey, and human, respectively. 
Blood-to-plasma partitioning was estimated in vivo in rats administered a single IV dose of [3H]inotuzumab 
ozogamicin. In rats, [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin radioequivalents in blood were lower than in plasma 
(blood/plasma radioactivity AUCinf ratio of 0.5), indicating that [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin-derived 
radioactivity preferentially distributed into plasma relative to red blood cells. 
In vitro, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH demonstrated limited distribution into red blood cells, with blood-to-
plasma partition ratios of 0.63, 0.84, and 0.71 in rat, monkey, and human, respectively.  Thus,

N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH concentrations measured in plasma are representative of the systemic exposure in 
the evaluated species.   
The primary metabolic pathway for inotuzumab ozogamicin was hydrolysis (deconjugation) at the hydrazone 
moiety to release N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH. Overall, inotuzumab ozogamicin is anticipated to be cleared 
from circulation (with concomitant deconjugation) by both target- and non-target-mediated pathways 
(Gerber et al, 2013; Kraynov et al, 2016).  The former pathway involves binding of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
to antigen on the surface of CD22-expressing cells, followed by internalization via receptor-mediated 
endocytosis, trafficking from endosomes to lysosomes, and intracellular release (hydrolysis) of 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH in the acidic lysosomal environment.  In the latter case, inotuzumab ozogamicin 
would be cleared by the normal pathways mediating IgG disposition, ie, non-specific uptake via pinocytosis 
by certain cell types (eg, endothelial cells) in multiple organs, including the liver.  Upon internalization, 
inotuzumab ozogamicin could be recycled to the circulation by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) or 
translocated to lysosomes, resulting in hydrolytic release of N-Ac--calicheamicin DMH and catabolism of the 
IgG4 portion of inotuzumab ozogamicin.  For released N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, the primary metabolic 
pathways was reduction (at the disulfide moiety). Hydrolysis (at the hydrazide moiety), oxidation, and 
adduction (with pyruvic acid) were minor metabolic pathways. 
Metabolic profiling and identification were conducted utilizing plasma, urine, fecal, and bile samples from the 
mass balance and excretion study in male and female intact and BDC rats after IV administration of a single 
0.91 mg/m2 (47.3 μCi/kg) dose of [3H]inotuzumab ozogamicin. The majority of radioactivity was recovered 
in the feces (approximately 80%). The vast majority of circulating radioactivity (~98%) remained associated 
with protein, and unconjugated calicheamicin-related radioactivity accounted for only ~2% of total circulating 
radioactivity. In plasma, the major extractable radiochemical peaks detected were M13, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH (M17), and M11, accounting for 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.2% of total plasma radioactivity, respectively, in 
male rats, and 0.3%, <0.1%, and 0.3% of total plasma radioactivity, respectively, in female rats. 
The in vivo metabolism of inotuzumab ozogamicin was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL 
administered 3 cycles of IV inotuzumab ozogamicin (1.8 mg/m2, q4 weeks). Following the third cycle of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, serum and urine samples were collected at 1 (immediately before the end of 
infusion), 3, and 48 hours postdose, pooled, and qualitatively profiled for the presence of metabolites. The 
only metabolite detected in serum was the expected hydrolytic product of inotuzumab ozogamicin, N-Ac-γ-
calicheamicin DMH (M17).

Recovery: At recovery necropsy, slight to mild hepatocellular hypertrophy was seen in 5/5 males and 
2/5 females given CMC-544 at 50 ug/kg/week. Testicular tubular degeneration and epididymal 
hypospermia were still present at recovery at marked to severe average severity. Tubular intraluminal 
proteinaceous casts were still present, randomly distributed in the renal parenchyma. In males given 
CMC-544 at 50 ug/kg/week, pulmonary alveolar macrophages were still randomly scattered within the 
parenchyma following a 4-week recovery period. The incidence was 3/5 in males. Microscopic evidence 
of sciatic nerve axonal degeneration at a greater severity was seen in males and females previously 
given CMC-544 at 50 ug/kg/week. A similar observation was made in the cervical spinal cord segment 
examined and trigeminal nerve section. Additionally, axonal degeneration (dorsal and lateral funiculi) 
was seen in the lumbar spinal cord in both males and females previously given CMC-544 at 
50ug/kg/week.  
a In this study, doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin expressed as calicheamicin equivalents on the basis of

Mortality: 5:  3 monkeys (2♀, 1♂) were electively euthanized due to a moribund condition that was 
considered CMC-544(inotuzumab ozogamicin)-related.  
Male I06983: Was electively euthanized on day 37 at approximately 26 hrs after its last dose on day 
36 (received total of 6 doses during study). Moribundity was attributed to a protein-losing 
glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis with or without systemic vasculitis is uncommon in cynomolgus 
monkeys. It could have been spontaneous in this monkey; however because of the temporal 
association with the administration of CMC-544, it was attributed to CMC-544. 
Female I06998: Was electively euthanized on day 87 at approximately 50 hrs after its last dose on 
day 85 (received total of 13 doses during study). Mortality was attributed to CMC-544; however, the 
mechanism could not be determined. 
Female I06999: Was electively euthanized on day 142 at approximately 187 hrs after its last dose on 
day 134 (received total of 20 doses during study). Moribundity was attributed to CMC-544; however, 
the mechanism could not be determined. 
Clinical signs: 5 ♂: Swollen areas (periorbital, muzzle) in 3 surviving males from week 22 to

on coded slides from animals treated at 
0, 28, 56, and 122.5 μg/kg 
calicheamicin equivalents, based on a 
trend test analysis (p = 0.001). Also, 
each dose group had a significantly 
higher proportion of micronucleated 
PCEs in comparisons with the vehicle 
control group (p ≤ 0.01, one-tailed 
Dunnett’s test). CMC-544 (inotuzumab 
ozogamicin)was positive for inducing 
micronucleated PCEs in the bone 
marrow of male mice in this study. 
Cytotoxic at concentrations equal to 
or greater than 225 μg/mL 
(calicheamicin equivalents).  High 
proportion of mPCEs at 0.28 to

N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was positive 
for mutagenic activity in the E. coli 
strain WP2 uvrA pKM101, with and 
without metabolic activation, and 
negative for mutagenic activity in the S. 
typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, 
TA1535, and TA1537 with and without 
metabolic activation under the 
conditions of this assay. 
Positive in the E. coli strain 
WP2 uvrA pKM101, with and 
without metabolic activation. 
Adequate positive and negative controls 
produced expected effects. Optimal 
cytotoxicity was not observed with any 
treatment; therefore, a repeat 
micronucleus assay was conducted at 
concentrations ranging from 0.00235 to 
39.5 ng/mL. 
Micronuclei were evaluated in 2000 cells 
per concentration. Statistically 
significant increases in the percent of 
micronucleated cells were observed at 
0.198 ng/mL in the 4-hour treatment 
without metabolic activation, at 0.0417 
and 0.0989 ng/mL in the 27-hour 
treatment without metabolic activation 
and at 0.395 and 0.618 ng/mL in the 4-
hour treatment with metabolic 
activation.  
Thus N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was 
positive for inducing micronuclei in vitro 
in TK6 cells with and without metabolic 
activation under the conditions of this 
test system.

Local Tolerance  
A separate local tolerance study was not conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin. Instead, local injection sites 
were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically in a single-dose toxicity study in rats and in the 4- and 
26-week toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. No inotuzumab ozogamicin-related findings were observed at 
the injection sites in animals in any of these studies. 
Other Toxicity Studies 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin did not show an in vitro potential for inducing haemolysis or methemoglobin 
formation in rats, monkeys, or humans (Report RPT-46353). 
There were no adverse clinical signs or effects on body weight in monkeys administered Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin with Neumega (rhuIL-11). A combination study with inotuzumab ozogamicin and Numega (rhIL-
11) suggested that animals given Neumega following inotuzumab ozogamicin have a slightly more rapid 
resolution of the (induced) thrombocytopenia (Report RPT-63930).  
G544 antibody specifically stained cryosections of the positive control human tonsil (follicular center and 
mantle lymphocytes, and intra-epithelial [migrating] or submucosal locations). G544 did not stain 
lymphocytes in the interfollicular areas of human tonsil (putative T-cells) and the negative control IgG4 
antibody did not specifically interact with any tonsillar tissues. There was no specific G544 binding observed 
in any rhesus monkey tissue examined (Report RPT-46813). 
G544 antibody specifically stained cryosections of the positive control human tonsil (follicular center and 
mantle lymphocytes, and intra-epithelial [migrating] or submucosal locations). G544 did not stain 
lymphocytes in the interfollicular areas of human tonsil (putative T-cells) and the negative control IgG4 
antibody did not specifically interact with any tonsillar tissues. G544-stained human lymphocytes were 
observed in the follicular centers and mantle regions of the lymph node and spleen, and G544 also stained 
rare to very rare lymphocytes in the interstitium in nonlymphoid tissues such as kidney, liver, and striated

skeletal muscle.  G544 did not stain human bone marrow, blood vessels (endothelium), or small intestine 
from any donor examined. There was no G544-specific staining of any monkey, dog, rabbit, rat, or mouse 
tissue examined (Report RPT-46814). 
Examination of the panel of human test tissues stained with the G544 antibody revealed staining of 
lymphocytes in lymph node (follicular), spleen (follicular and mantle; red pulp), tonsil (follicular and mantle), 
GALT, mononuclear cell infiltrates, and blood smears. Staining was localized to the membrane and 
cytoplasm. In most, but not all cases, staining was present at both concentrations of the G544 antibody 
(Report RPT-63271). 
No studies on immunogenicity have been performed by the applicant. However, immunogenicity of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin was assessed in 4- and 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys by 
measuring the levels of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in satellite animals (rats) or main study animals 
(monkeys). Two of 20 satellite rats (10%) administered inotuzumab ozogamicin (1 animal given 
4.07 mg/m2/week) or G544 antibody (1 animal) for 4 weeks tested positive for ADA at one or more time 
points after initiation of dosing. No rats were positive for ADA in the 0.41 and 1.24 mg/m2/week groups. Two 
of 15 (13.3%) satellite rats designated for ADA analysis and administered inotuzumab ozogamicin for 26 
weeks tested positive for ADA at one or more timepoints after the initiation of dosing (2 of 5 rats at 
0.073 mg/m2/week; 0 of 5 rats each at 0.218 or 0.727 mg/m2/week). In the 4- and 26-week repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in monkeys, ADA was not detected in any animals after administration of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin or the G544 antibody. Samples from monkeys given 0.216 mg/m2/week inotuzumab ozogamicin 
for 26 weeks had detectable drug concentrations at the last time point of sample collection which may have 
hindered the detection of an ADA response. 
PF-06647259, a nonbinding calicheamicin conjugate, induced thrombocytopenia and liver microvascular 
injury in cynomolgus monkeys. Characterization of liver microscopic findings showed loss of SECs associated 
with platelet sequestration on Day 3 followed by phenotypic alterations of recovered SECs (CD34 
overexpression indicative of sinusoidal capillarization) and parenchymal remodelling consisting mostly of 
sinusoidal dilation and/or hepatocellular atrophy on Day 63. Evaluation of platelet counts showed acute 
reversible platelet decreases during the 1st cycle secondary to liver SEC injury and prolonged platelet 
decreases during subsequent cycles of uncertain exact pathogenesis. Serum HA levels were increased in test 
article-dosed animals and correlated well with AST and liver microscopic changes, suggesting that HA could 
be a sensitive mechanism-based diagnostic marker of liver microvascular injury (Report 14GR346). 
The toxicity of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH (released unconjugated calicheamicin) was evaluated in mice, rats 
and/or dogs after single- or repeat-dose administration. No new important target organ toxicities were 
observed with N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH administration versus those reported for inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Nevertheless, there were differences in the severity and/or incidence of the toxicities between the two 
derivatives which perhaps can be attributed to differences in ADME properties (Reports MIRACL-24627, 
MIRACL-26628, MIRACL-26629, MIRACL-26630, MIRACL-26707). 
In studies with N-Ac-Epsilon-Calicheamicin in rats, mean heart weights were slightly decreased, and mean 
thymus weights were slightly increased. The organ weight changes were not associated with any macroscopic 
or microscopic findings. There were no N-Ac-Epsilon-Calicheamicin-related findings presented in the dog. 
Thus, it can be concluded that the ε-form of calicheamicin seems to be less toxic than the γ-form (Reports 
MIRACL-25706 and MIRACL-25707).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an ADC composed of a CD22 directed monoclonal antibody that is covalently 
linked to N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide. Inotuzumab is a humanised immunoglobulin class 
G subtype 4 (IgG4) antibody that specifically recognises human CD22. The small molecule, N acetyl gamma 
calicheamicin, is a cytotoxic product. N acetyl gamma calicheamicin is covalently attached to the antibody via 
an acid-cleavable linker. Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of BESPONSA is due to the 
binding of the ADC to CD22 expressing tumour cells, followed by internalisation of the ADC-CD22 complex, 
and the intracellular release of N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide via hydrolytic cleavage of 
the linker. Activation of N acetyl gamma calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide induces double-stranded DNA 
breaks, subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death (SmPC section 5.1). 
In vivo, inotuzumab ozogamicin exhibited dose-dependent regression of subcutaneous B-cell ALL and 
lymphoma xenografts. Sustained tumour regression was achieved in inotuzumab ozogamicin treated tumours 
compared to controls that included G544 antibody, unconjugated N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, or gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin. B-cell lymphoma xenografts treated with rituximab or chemotherapy had shorter duration 
responses, but relapsed tumours regressed upon further treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin. In a 
disseminated model of ALL, treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin effectively suppressed tumour growth in 
mice, leading to 100% survival and strongly inhibited the engraftment of human CD45-positive leukemic cells 
in mice with disseminated disease. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is currently intended as single agent treatment for ALL. Any concomitant medicines 
(i.e. steroids, anti–infectives etc.) that may be used at the time of treatment were administered during the 
clinical trials and thus specific non clinical studies are not considered warranted. It is however not anticipated 
that there will be any interaction with any routine medications that might be taken by ALL patients, as such 
medication would not be expected to have a significant effect on either CD22 binding or the DNA targeting of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin. The lack of formal pharmacodynamic interaction studies with common concomitant 
drugs, with the exception of the combination with chemotherapy above, is accepted. 
Hydrolytic release of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH from inotuzumab ozogamicin in circulation was limited. 
Plasma protein binding of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was high in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human 
plasma.

Distribution of inotuzumab ozogamicin into tissues of rats was limited. A metabolism study conducted in the 
rat showed that most of the plasma radioactivity was associated with protein(s). In rats, N-Ac-γ-
calicheamicin DMH was extensively metabolised following release from inotuzumab ozogamicin and the 
predominant metabolic pathway was reduction (at the disulfide moiety) resulting in formation of 
N-Ac-ε-calicheamicin (M16) and tetrasaccharide metabolites (M1, M5) via a putative reductive 
deglycosylation mechanism. In serum from patients administered inotuzumab ozogamicin, the only 
metabolite detected was N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH. All metabolites detected in patient samples were also 
observed in rats. In vitro studies showed that the metabolism of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH occurs primarily 
via non-enzymatic reduction. 
 Ex vivo, inotuzumab ozogamicin showed bioconjugative transformation in plasma, with the major product 
identified as an apparent adduct formed via a putative disulfide exchange reaction mechanism between N-Ac-
γ-calicheamicin and an unidentified high MW protein. Following IV administration to rats, the major route of 
excretion of drug-related radioactivity was via faeces, secondary to biliary elimination. 
In animals, the primary target organs included the liver, bone marrow and lymphoid organs with associated 
haematological changes, kidney and nervous system (SmPC section 5.3). Effects in the liver included 
adenomas, basophilic and eosinophilic foci, angiectasis and sinusoidal dilation, oval cell hyperplasia and 
cholangiofibrosis, hepatocellular hypertrophy, karyomegaly, hepatocellular vacuolation, fibrosis and increased 
extramedullary haemopoiesis.  
In non-clinical studies, cranial and peripheral sensory neuropathy was target independent and likely a 
primary cytotoxic effect of calicheamicin on cell bodies in ganglia with subsequent axonal degeneration. 
Neurotoxicity has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Animal studies demonstrated chronic progressive nephropathy (rats) and glomerulonephritis (1 monkey).. 
The former is a common spontaneous finding in rats but the latter in monkeys, although low incidence, is 
unusual and a potential link with the compound cannot be dismissed. Nephrotoxicity has been categorized as 
a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Other observed changes included male and female reproductive organ effects and preneoplastic and 
neoplastic liver lesions (SmPC section 5.3). Effects in reproductive organs were tubular degeneration in the 
testes, hypospermia in the epididymides, atrophy in the male mammary gland, decreased colloid in the 
seminal vesicles as well as effects on female organs.  
Most effects were reversible to partially reversible except for effects in the liver and nervous system. The 
relevance of the irreversible animal findings to humans is uncertain (SmPC section 5.3). 
The observation of inotuzumab ozogamicin-related effects in multiple target organs in 2 non-clinical species 
is consistent with non-specific cytotoxicity attributable to the lack of tissue-specific binding of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in either species, since the antibody component of inotuzumab ozogamicin targets the human 
CD22 antigen and does not cross-react with the CD22 antigen expressed in either rats or monkeys. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was clastogenic in vivo in the bone marrow of male mice. This is consistent with the 
known induction of DNA breaks by calicheamicin and other enediyne antitumour antibiotics. Inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay when tested up to the 
maximum feasible dose (SmPC section 5.3). 
Formal carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin. In line with current 
guidance (i.e. ICH S9), the lack of dedicated carcinogenicity bioassays is acceptable.

In toxicity studies, rats developed oval cell hyperplasia, altered hepatocellular foci, and hepatocellular 
adenomas in the liver at approximately 0.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. In 1 monkey, a 
focus of hepatocellular alteration was detected at approximately 3.1 times the human clinical exposure based 
on AUC at the end of the 26 week dosing period. The relevance of these animal findings to humans is 
uncertain (SmPC section 5.3). The observed liver toxicity is consistent with the mechanism of action of 
calicheamicin and considered a cytotoxic effect. 
Administration of inotuzumab ozogamicin to female rats at the maternally toxic dose (approximately 2.3 
times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) prior to mating and during the first week of gestation 
resulted in embryo-foetal toxicity, including increased resorptions and decreased viable embryos. The 
maternally toxic dose (approximately 2.3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC) also resulted in 
foetal growth retardation, including decreased foetal weights and delayed skeletal ossification. Slight foetal 
growth retardation in rats also occurred at approximately 0.4 times the human clinical exposure based on 
AUC (SmPC section 5.3) 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is considered to have the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in 
men and women based on nonclinical findings. In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, female 
reproductive findings included atrophy of ovaries, uterus, vagina, and mammary gland. The no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the effects on female reproductive organs in rats and monkeys was 
approximately 2.2 and 3.1 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC, respectively. In repeat dose 
toxicity studies in rats, male reproductive findings included testicular degeneration, associated with 
hypospermia, and prostatic and seminal vesicle atrophy. The NOAEL was not identified for the effects on 
male reproductive organs, which were observed at approximately 0.3 times the human clinical exposure 
based on AUC (SmPC section 5.3). 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Women should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and 
for at least 8 months after the last dose. Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use 
effective contraception during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and for at least 5 months after the last 
dose (SmPC, section 4.6).  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin must not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother 
outweighs the potential risks to the foetus. Pregnant women, or patients becoming pregnant while receiving 
inotuzumab ozogamicin, or treated male patients as partners of pregnant women, must be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus (SmPC, section 4.6). 
There are no data on the presence of inotuzumab ozogamicin or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on 
the breast-fed child, or the effects on milk production. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in 
breast-fed children, women must not breast-feed during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and for at 
least 2 months after the final dose (SmPC, section 4.6). 
In a combination toxicity study with Neumega (rhuIL-11) in monkeys, a slightly more rapid resolution of 
induced thrombocytopenia was seen with Neumega compared to inotuzumab ozogamicin alone. 
An in vitro blood compatibility study showed no potential for erythrocyte lysis in rats, monkeys or humans. 
In tissue cross-reactivity studies, unconjugated antibody did not show specific staining in any of the selected 
non-human tissues. In the cross-reactivity study in human tissues, inotuzumab ozogamicin reacted with 
potential CD22-expressing cells in the tissues evaluated. The staining appeared to be consistent with 
distribution of CD22 reported in the literature.

The PECsurfacewater was calculated to 2.4x10-7, which is below the cation level 0,01. Therefore no further 
environmental testing is required for inotuzumab ozogamicin. Accordingly, the introduction of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin is not expected to result in an increased environmental risk. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The population PK analysis included pooled PK data from two studies in patients with relapsed or refractory 
ALL (B1931010 and B1931022) and 9 studies in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL (B1931001, 
B1931002, B1931003, B1931004, B1931005, B1931006, B1931007, B1931008 and B1931016).  
Absorption  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not applicable. 
Distribution 
In vitro, the binding of the N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide to human plasma proteins is 
approximately 97%. In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is a substrate of P 
glycoprotein (P-gp). In humans, the total volume of distribution of inotuzumab ozogamicin was 
approximately 12 L (SmPC, section 5.2). 
In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide was primarily metabolised via nonenzymatic 
reduction. In humans, serum N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide levels were typically below 
the limit of quantitation (50 pg/mL)  (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin pharmacokinetics were well characterised by a 2-compartment model with linear and 
time-dependent clearance components. In 234 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the clearance of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin at steady state was 0.0333 L/h, and the terminal elimination half life (t½) at the end 
of Cycle 4 was approximately 12.3 days. Following administration of multiple doses, a 5.3 times accumulation 
of inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed between Cycles 1 and 4 (SmPC, section 5.2).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The CL or CL/f of inotuzumab ozogamicin, total calicheamicin, and total antibody following a single dose of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin ranging from 1.3 to 2.4 mg/m2 is shown in Table 14. The CL or CL/f was not 
estimable at the 0.4 and 0.8 mg/m2 dose levels. 
Table 14 Pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of a single dose of 1.3 to 2.4 
mg/m2 of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL (Studies B1931002 
and B1931016) 
The CL or CL/f of inotuzumab ozogamicin, total calicheamicin and total antibody following multiple doses of 
0.8 to 2.4 q3w inotuzumab ozogamicin is shown in Table 15. The CL or CL/f was not estimable at the 0.4 
mg/m2 dose level.

Time dependencies 
Based on the simulation from population pharmacokinetic analysis, the mean half-life of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (estimated from the beta t1/2) at steady state was 12.3 days. With the recommended dosing 
regimen of inotuzumab ozogamicin at a total dose of 1.8 mg/m2 per cycle (Day 1: 0.8 mg/m2, Days 8 and 
15: 0.5 mg/m2), the geometric mean ratio (90% CI) for accumulation in patients with ALL was 5.30 (5.12, 
5.47).

Special populations 
The effect of renal function on the inotuzumab CL was evaluated using baseline creatinine clearance (BCCL) 
in a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

a. Total clearance (CL) calculated as CL=CL1+CLt, where CLt=CL2•e (-kdes•Time). CL was obtained at the last time point 
of the last cycle for each patient. 
b. In order to summarize the ALL and NHL patients together, the total clearance (CL) was adjusted for NHL patients to 
include the covariate effects from ALL patients. 
The impact of hepatic function on inotuzumab ozogamicin CL was evaluated using the hepatic function 
defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI ODWG) (normal [A], mild [B1], 
mild [B2], moderate [C], and severe [D]) as a categorical covariate and baseline laboratory values of BALT, 
BAST, and BBIL as continuous covariates in a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

In the population PK analysis 458 patients were males and 307 females. Since gender was highly correlated 
with baseline body surface area (BBSA), it was not tested in the GAM or SCM. The incorporation of BBSA as 
covariate in the final model corrected any previous trends with respect to gender.  
In the population PK analysis 534 patients were Caucasian, 20 were Black, 155 were Asian (including 101 
Japanese), 53 ‘Other’ and 3 unknown. In the graphical plots, Asian patients tended to have lower CL1, CL2 
and V1 relative to non-Asian patients (Caucasians, Blacks and Other grouped together). During the GAM 
analysis, the effect of Asian ethnicity (Asian [including Japanese] versus non-Asian) on PK parameters CL1, 
CL2, V1 and kdes was not significant (based on AIC criteria) and hence, was not further tested for statistical 
significance in the SCM. 
Although Asian ethnicity was not tested in the SCM analysis, the ETAs on the PK parameters were corrected 
for Asian ethnicity due the effect of BBSA on CL1, CL2 and V1 in the final model and the correlation between 
Asian ethnicity and BBSA. BBSA in Asians tended to be lower compared to non-Asians, approximately 12% 
difference in the medians. The BBSA medians (ranges) for Asians (including Japanese) and non-Asians were 
1.66 m2 (1.13-2.08 m2) and 1.90 m2 (1.27-2.81 m2), respectively.

The median BBSA in the population PK analysis was 1.84 m2 with 10th and 90th percentile BSAs of 1.55 m2 
and 2.21 m2, respectively. 
Increasing BBSA was correlated with an increase in CL1, CL2 and V1. In order to evaluate the magnitude of 
the effect of BBSA on inotuzumab ozogamicin PK, CL1, CL2 and V1 were calculated at extreme values of 
BBSA (10th and 90th percentile in the analysis population) and compared with the typical values at a median 
baseline BBSA of 1.84 m2. The magnitudes of the effects of BBSA were as follows: 
- Relative to the CL1 typical value of 0.113 L/h for a BBSA of 1.84 m2, CL1 decreased by 23.4% for a BBSA 
of 1.55 m2 and increased by 32.8 % for a BBSA of 2.21 m2. 
- Relative to the CL2 typical value of 0.368 L/h for a BBSA of 1.84 m2, CL2 decreased by 24.8% for a BBSA 
of 1.55 m2 and increased by 35.3% for a BBSA of 2.21 m2. 
- Relative to the V1 typical value of 6.70 L for a BBSA of 1.84 m2, V1 decreased by 22.7% for a BBSA of 1.55 
m2 and increased by 28.8% for a BBSA of 2.21 m2. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
The potential for inotuzumab ozogamicin to reversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of 8 CYP enzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5) was investigated in human 
liver microsomes (HLM). Inotuzumab ozogamicin showedlittle or no inhibition for the CYP enzyme activities 
tested, with IC50 >10 µM (highest concentration tested) and an estimated inhibition constant (Ki) of >5 µM. 
Assessment of DDI potential with inotuzumab ozogamicin for reversible CYP inhibition, based on the IC50 
values of >10 µM determined from in vitro studies and the mean steady-state (total) Cmax of 308 ng/mL 
(00192μM) following multiple dose administration of 1.8 mg/m2 of inotuzumab ozogamicin to humans, 
indicated a low potential for inotuzumab ozogamicin to inhibit the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 (R1 value of <1.1, and Cmax/Ki <0.02).

Inotuzumab ozogamicin was also examined for time-dependent inhibition effects with several CYP enzyme 
activities in pooled HLM. Inotuzumab ozogamicin showed little or no change in time-dependent inhibitory 
potency for CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4/5 activities.  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4 mRNA expression and/or 
enzyme activity in any of the 3 hepatocyte lots evaluated at concentrations ranging from 0.003 to 0.32 μM of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin (highest concentration evaluated). 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was a substrate for the P-gp efflux transporter, but not the BCRP efflux 
transporter. In MDCK type II cells expressing P-gp, the mean basolateral-to-apical permeability (B-A) to 
apical-to-basolateral permeability (A-B) efflux ratio for N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH was approximately 5 and 
efflux was inhibited by the P-gp inhibitor PSC 833. The efflux ratio for the positive control P-gp substrate, 
quinidine, was 12. In MDCK cells expressing BCRP, the mean B-A to A-B efflux ratio for N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH was 1.2, whereas the efflux ratios for the positive control BCRP substrates, topotecan and pitavastatin, 
were 23 and 26, respectively. 
Uptake of rosuvastatin (1 μM), a known substrate for hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, 
was used as a positive control to confirm active uptake. The rate of hepatic uptake of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH was not inhibited by rifamycin SV. In contrast, the rate of hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin (positive 
control) was fully inhibited by rifamycin SV (97% inhibition). These results indicate that in vitro, N-Ac-γ-
calicheamicin DMH enters human hepatocytes by passive diffusion and that the hepatic uptake transporters 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are unlikely to be a major contributing factor in facilitating the entry of N-Ac-γ-
calicheamicin DMH into hepatocytes. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed little or no reversible inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 with IC50 values >10 µM (highest concentration tested) and an estimated inhibition 
constant (Ki) of >5 µM. However, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH did show reversible inhibition of CYP3A4/5, with 
IC50 values of 5.5, 0.42 and 0.40 µM for testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, midazolam 1’-hydroxylation and 
nifedipine oxidation, respectively. 
Assessment of DDI potential with N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH for reversible CYP inhibition, based on the IC50 
values determined from in vitro studies and the mean steady-state (total) Cmax of ≤0.050 ng/mL 
(≤0.000034 μM) or unbound Cmax of ≤9.5 x 10-7 μM following multiple dose administration of 1.8 mg/m2 of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin (administered as 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-28 day cycle) 
to humans, indicated a low potential for N-Ac-β-calicheamicin DMH to reversibly inhibit the activities of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4/5 at clinically relevant concentrations (R1 
value of <1.1, and unbound Cmax/Ki <0.02).  
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed little or no change in time-dependent inhibitory potency for CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 activities. However, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH did show time-
dependent inhibitory activity of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5 activity (as measured by testosterone 6β-
hydroxylation and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation). N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed very weak time-
dependent inhibition of CYP2C8, with the concentration at half the maximal rate of enzyme inactivation (KI) 
of >30 μM; thus, definitive in vitro inactivation kinetic parameters could not be estimated. For CYP3A4/5, the 
KI and maximal rate of enzyme inactivation (kinact) parameters were 0.077 μM and 0.00368 min-1 for 
midazolam and 0.237 μM and 0.00434 min-1 for testosterone, respectively. 
Assessment of DDI potential with N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH for time-dependent CYP3A4/5 inhibition, based 
on the inactivation parameters determined in vitro, a CYP3A4/5 kdeg value of 0.00032 min-1 (Fahmi et al, 
2008 and Obach et al, 2007), and the mean steady-state (total) Cmax of ≤0.050 ng/mL (≤0.000034 μM), 
Assessment report

indicated a low potential for N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH to inhibit CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent manner at 
clinically relevant concentrations (R2 values of <1.1). 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH did not cause induction of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 mRNA expression and/or 
enzyme activity in any of the 3 hepatocyte lots evaluated at up to 0.3 μM of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH 
(highest concentration evaluated). 
In humans, the mean steady-state total N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH Cmax after multiple dose administration 
of 1.8 mg/m2 inotuzumab ozogamicin  was ≤0.050 ng/mL (≤0.000034 μM) (Study B1931022). Since N-Ac-γ-
calicheamicin DMH did not show an induction effect on the evaluated CYP enzymes at up to 0.3 μM, which 
was >50x the Cmax, the potential for N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH to induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 
activities is considered to be low at clinically relevant concentrations. 
In the presence or absence of 2% BSA, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed  little or no reversible inhibition of 
UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 catalyzed activities (IC50 >10 μM). However, N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH inhibited UGT1A1 activity with IC50 values of 0.61 and 1.4 µM, in the absence or presence of 2% BSA, 
respectively. The unbound IC50 value could not be determined due to instability of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin 
DMH in the 5 hour in vitro HLM-BSA binding assay. 
Assessments based on the comparison of the IC50 (total) and N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH Cmax values (≤3.4 
x 10-5 and ≤9.5 x 10-7 μM for total and unbound, respectively) following multiple dose administration of 1.8 
mg/m2 of inotuzumab ozogamicin (administered as 0.8, 0.5 and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-28 
day cycle) to humans indicate a low likelihood of DDI involving N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH and the evaluated 
UGT enzymes (R1 value of <1.1, and total or unbound Cmax to Ki values <0.02). 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH showed little or no inhibition of the bidirectional transport of digoxin (P-gp 
substrate) or pitavastatin (BCRP substrate). The efflux ratio of digoxin in the absence and presence of N-Ac-
γ-calicheamicin DMH (0.3 μM) was 39.1 and 48.2, respectively, indicating no decrease in digoxin efflux ratio 
at the highest concentration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH evaluated. The efflux ratio of pitavastatin in the 
absence and presence of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH (0.3 μM) was 9.52 and 7.99, respectively, indicating a 
16% decrease in pitavastatin efflux ratio at the highest concentration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH 
evaluated. The IC50 of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH-mediated inhibition of P-gp and BCRP was estimated to be 
>0.3 μM, and the Ki was estimated to be >0.15 μM.  
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of BSEP, with a maximal 
inhibition of 35% at 1.0 μM (the highest concentration evaluated).  No concentration-dependent inhibition of 
MRP2 at concentrations up to 1 μM was observed.  The estimated IC50 values for N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH-
mediated inhibiton of BSEP and MRP2 were >1.0 μM, with estimated Ki values of >1.0 μM (Ki ~ IC50, as the 
assay substrate concentration <<Km) and >0.5 μM (calculated Ki = IC50/2), respectively. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, over the concentrations evaluated (0.0002 to 1.0 μM), did not inhibit MATE1 or 
MATE2K, while the positive control inhibitor (cimetidine) inhibited the activity for these transporters by 
>97%.  The IC50 of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH-mediated transporter inhibition was estimated to be >1.0 μM 
(Ki >1.0 μM, as the assay substrate concentration <<Km [Michealis constant]). 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH inhibited the OATP1B1- OATP1B3 and OCT1-mediated transport of the respective 
probe substrate, in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at the highest 
concentration of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH evaluated (0.1 µM) was 30% and 16%, respectively, while 
rifamycin SV (100 μM, positive control inhibitor) inhibited the transport of pravastatin and rosuvastatin by 
98% and 57%, respectively. The IC50 of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH-mediated inhibition of OATP1B1 and 
Assessment report

OATP1B3 was estimated to be >0.1 μM, and the Ki was estimated to be >0.05 μM.  N-Ac--calicheamicin 
DMH inhibited the OCT1-mediated transport of the respective probe substrate, with a corresponding IC50 and 
Ki of 0.530 μM (Ki ~ IC50, as the assay substrate concentration <<Km).  Results indicate a low potential for 
an interaction between N-Ac--calicheamicin DMH and these transporters at clinically relevant concentrations 
as the ratio of total Cmax/IC50 was <0.1, and 50 × the unbound Cmax (4.7 x 10-5 μM) did not exceed the 
estimated Ki values. 
N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH, over the concentrations evaluated ( 0.002 to 0.5 µM for OAT1 and at a 
concentration range of 0.0004 to 0.1 µM for OAT3 and OCT2, did not inhibit OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2), while the 
positive control inhibitors (probenecid for OAT1 and OAT3 and verapamil for OCT2) inhibited the activity for 
these transporters by >95%. The IC50 of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH-mediated transporter inhibition was 
estimated to be >0.5 μM (Ki >0.25 μM) for OAT1 and >0.1 μM (Ki >0.05 μM) for OAT3 and OCT2. 
In vivo 
No formal pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with inotuzumab ozogamicin.  
The effects of concomitant medications on inotuzumab ozogamicin PK were tested in the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. There were varying numbers of patients taking P-glycoprotein (PGP) inhibitors 
(18.2%), granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (GCSF, 23.9%), hydroxyurea (HYDR, 1.70%), inotuzumab 
ozogamicin given with concomitant treatment for first 2 cycles (COMB, 57.8%), prior radiotherapy (RADIO, 
25.0%), inotuzumab ozogamicin administered with rituximab (RITX, 50.22%), and salvage therapy (SALV, 
Salvage 1 = 54.7%, Salvage 2 = 32.9%, and Salvage 3+ = 11.5%). For HYDR, patients were all from the 
ALL studies and, for RITX, patients were all from the NHL studies. For SALV, patients were from the ALL 
studies, as this was not applicable/ collected in the NHL studies; and patients that were Salvage 3 were all 
from Study B1931010. 
The effects of PGP, GCSF, HYDR, COMB, RADIO and SALV were tested on parameters CL1 and CL2, and only 
SALV on kdes. The GAM results showed no significant effects (based on AIC criteria) of PGP, GCSF, COMB 
and RADIO on CL1 and CL2; however SALV was significant on kdes, and HYDR and RITX were significant on 
CL1. After testing the covariates in the SCM, RITX was retained as the only significant covariate on CL1. 
Hence, covariates PGP, GCSF, HYDR, COMB, RADIO and SALV were concluded to not affect the PK of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin. In the final model, the effect of RITX (patients that were not administered rituximab 
with inotuzumab ozogaminicin) was estimated to increase CL1 by 15.5% (95%CI: 4.64%-26.4%) 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity evaluation was performed as per the CHMP Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of 
Biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 and Draft 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1) using screening, confirmatory and neutralization assays.  
Determination of titres was also incorporated. There was no positive control (PC) against the whole molecule 
but the approach taken is reasonable. It was shown that the assay detects antibodies against inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in 2 ways – by use of anti-G544 (PC1) which gave a positive signal in the assay and by spiking 
high and low concentrations of PC1 with the whole molecule which resulted in ~ 95% and 78% inhibition. For 
establishing drug interference, PC1 at high and low concentrations was incubated with different 
Assessment report

concentrations of the whole molecule and binding assessed. The drug concentrations in the assay were 
higher than those that would be encountered in clinical samples. 
To determine assay sensitivity, affinity purified antibody was used and the sensitivity in mass calculated. For 
all other evaluations within the validation exercise, non-purified rabbit polyclonal serum at a certain dilution 
was used. 
No anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were detected in Study B1931010. 
In study B1931022 ADAs were detected in 7 of 155 (4.5%) of patients tested. Four of these patients had low 
titre pre-existing antibodies that became undetectable during the study. In five patients, the antibodies 
appeared to be specific for the calicheamicin portion of inotuzumab ozogamicin. One patient had anti-G544 
antibodies of low specificity with borderline competition results. One patient with ADAs at the EOT had a 
mixed response to calicheamicin and G544 of low specificity with borderline results in the confirmation assay. 
Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in any of the 6 patients.  
Using post-hoc clearance (CL) in the ALL studies derived from the population -PK analysis, CL of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin appeared to be comparable between patients who tested positive and negative for ADAs. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Percentage CD22 positivity 
The antibody component of inotuzumab ozogamicin, G544, specifically recognises human CD22. Prior to 
enrolment in the ALL studies, patients were screened for CD22 positivity on the blast cell surface. Testing 
was conducted at local laboratories followed by analysis of samples from subjects who tested CD22-positive 
locally at central laboratories [Genoptix, Carlsbad, CA, US (Study B1931022) or University of Washington, 
Seattle, WA, US  (Study B1931010)]. Eligibility was based on local laboratory analysis for both studies. In 
Study B1931022 patients who were CD22-negative by local laboratory testing and subsequently determined 
to be CD22-positive by the central laboratory could be considered for eligibility.CD22 measurement was 
primarily by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with immunohistochemistry analysis in patients with 
inadequate bone marrow aspirate or insufficient circulating blasts for FACS. Leukaemic cells were defined as 
CD22 positive if the level of fluorescence associated with binding of the CD22 monoclonal antibody [mouse 
anti-human monoclonal antibody clone RFB-4] was greater than the threshold value typically set based on 
the fluorescent intensity of leukemic cells stained with an isotype-matched control antibody. The validation 
report and addendums regarding peripheral blood specimens and inter-laboratory qualification were 
provided.  
Initially samples were considered to be positive if ≥20% of leukaemic blasts expressed surface CD22. The 
cut-off value was subsequently changed to >0% blasts (Protocol Amendment 2, StudyB1931022) based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 52/133 
 
  
  
 
the finding that some subjects that failed screening in the Phase 1/2 study B1931010 tested CD22 negative 
locally (≥20% cut-off) but were CD22-positive based on Central laboratory testing. 
To assess concordance between local and central testing, patients were divided into groups (≥90%, ≥70-
<90%, >0 -<70%, 0%)) based on the % of CD22+ leukaemic blasts in their baseline specimen. Similar 
results were seen for both ALL studies. By central testing (Study B1931022) most patients had over 90% 
CD22 + leukaemic blasts at baseline. There was good concordance (~99.6%) for evaluable subjects 
(252/253) between central and local testing for CD22-positivity > 0%. However, concordance was poor 
(~37%) between Central and Local laboratories with regards to the level of positivity (≥90%, ≥70 - <90%, 
90%, >0 - <70%, 0%)). In general, a higher percentage of blasts were CD22-positive when measured by 
central versus local laboratory testing, suggesting that the central laboratory test was more sensitive. 
There was reasonable concordance (87.7%) between bone marrow and peripheral blood by Central 
laboratory for assessment of the % blasts that were CD22 + at baseline based on 57 evaluable patients.  
Overall, in Studies B1931022 and B1931010, 415 patients (333 patients in Study B1931022 and 82 patients 
in Study B1931010) were evaluable by CD22 testing at a central laboratory at baseline (including 342 
enrolled patients and 73 patients who screen-failed) and, of these, 1/415 (0.2%) patients was CD22-
negative (i.e. CD22 positivity=0%) by central laboratory testing. 
Overall, of enrolled patients in Studies B1931022 and B1931010, 367 patients (305 patients in Study 
B1931022 and 62 patients in Study B1931010) were evaluable for CD22 testing at a local laboratory at 
baseline. Of these 367 patients, only one (who subsequently exhibited 86% CD22 positivity by central 
laboratory test) had CD22-negative B-cell ALL by local lab testing (ie, CD22 positivity=0%), consistent with 
CD22 positivity being an inclusion criterion for these studies. It is not possible to determine the true 
proportion of locally tested patients who were CD22-negative, since local laboratory CD22 test results were 
not formally captured for patients who failed screening and not all those who were screened negative locally 
were sent for central review.The applicant analysed reduction in CD22 % blast positivity with each cycle of 
treatment by central laboratory. Over half of the patients were missing or not evaluable by the end of Cycle 1 
in the Phase 3 study, partly reflecting limited sampling time-points in this study; the Phase 1/2 study had 
less missing information. From Baseline through to Cycle 2, where there are results for a reasonable number 
of patients, CD22+ leukaemic blasts as a proportion of the total number of blasts declined more in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin groups.

a CD22+ leukaemic blasts (%) is calculated based on the number of leukaemic blasts with CD22 greater than negative control values 
relative to all leukaemic blasts in the specimen.

c Includes patients who received a total starting dose of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle inotuzumab ozogamicin with a protocol-specified reduction in dose 
upon achievement of response to treatment  
d Number of patients in the indicated CD22+ leukaemic blasts (%) category relative to all patients treated in the indicated arm at the 
corresponding time-point. Screening and Baseline percentages are based on all patients randomized. 
e Baseline is based on the latest CD22 assessment from the central laboratory on or prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 
Similar proportions of patients who achieved CR/CRi also achieved MRD negativity (60.0 – 83.1%) in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm regardless of the baseline percentage leukaemic blasts that were CD -22 
positive. The CR/CRi rate in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm was 77.6% for patients who had ≥90% CD22-
positive leukaemic blasts at baseline and 66.7% for those with ≥70% to <90%. Only 5 patients had <70% 
CD22-positive leukaemic blasts at baseline per Central laboratory of whom 3 achieved CR/CRi. 
Based on the PK E-R modelling analysis of the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-ALL (PMAR-EQDD-B193a-DP4- 205 Supplement), the percentage of leukaemic blasts that were 
CD22-positive was a significant predictor of CR/CRi and achieving MRD-negativity. By the end of the second 
cycle (Cycle 3 Day 1), patients with ALL had a median predicted probability of 82% (95% CI: 67-91) of 
achieving CR/CRi when the percentage of leukaemic blasts that were CD22-positive at baseline was ≥70%. 
In Study B1931022, based on both univariate and multivariate stepwise Cox regression analysis, baseline 
≥90% CD22 positivity was associated with a lower risk of death than <90% CD22 positivity when CD22 
positivity was analysed as a categorical variable. For patients with <90% leukaemic blasts CD22-positive at 
baseline, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 
the control arm. CD22 positivity per central laboratory was not significantly associated with risk of death 
when assessed as a continuous variable in this analysis (p=0.09). 
In Study B1931022, there were signs of improved PFS with inotuzumab ozogamicin independent of CD22 
positivity, whereas DoR improvement for inotuzumab ozogamicin over control was apparent only in patients 
with CD22 positivity ≥90%. 
Although evaluable subject numbers were low, in Study 1931022 and Study 1931010, recurrent disease was 
not generally attributable to outgrowth of CD22-negative clones, although there were signs of potential 
outgrowth of clones with relatively low CD22 expression.  
Gene expression 
The relationship between clinical outcome and expression of genes involved in DNA damage response, 
apoptosis and B-cell antigen expression was examined. No relationship was apparent between baseline CD22 
mRNA levels in peripheral blood and efficacy outcomes. In Study B1931010, CD22 mRNA levels in peripheral 
blood decreased by Day 15 relative to baseline (median 97% decrease). By Day 15 CD22 mRNA levels in 
patients who subsequently achieved CR/CRi and MRD negativity were significantly lower than in patients who

did not subsequently achieve CR/CRi. Post-baseline changes in CD22 mRNA levels were not assessed in 
Study B1930122.  
QTc prolongation  
QTc prolongation was evaluated in three exposure- response models. The first, involving only 8 NHL patients, 
suggested an effect of inotuzumab ozogamicin on QT interval with a calculated average QTcF increase of 6.32 
milliseconds (msec) (90% CI: 1.85 – 10.8) at the mean inotuzumab ozogamicin Cmax (569 ng/mL).  
The second model was developed from 80 NHL subjects; the average QTcS increase was calculated to be 
4.66 msec (90% CI: 2.60-6.71) at the median total calicheamicin Cmax (61 ng/mL). Treatment cycle was 
suggested to be an additional covariate; after four treatment cycles, the expected increase in QTcS interval 
was 7.83 msec (90% CI: 4.83-10.8) at the median total calicheamicin Cmax.  
The final population PK-QTc model involved patients 250 treated with single-agent inotuzumab ozogamicin 
for relapsed/ refractory B-cell ALL (Study B1931022 and Study B1931010) or relapsed/ refractory NHL 
(Study B1931007). The final model is considered the most relevant for the ALL indication, as the others 
involved the 4-weekly NHL dosing regimen with a higher Cmax. Simulated QTcF showed that the median 
QTcF increased by 2.53  msec from baseline (97.5th percentile: 4.92 msec) at the average maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) estimated for patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (371 ng/mL) and by 3.87 msec 
(97.5th percentile: 7.54 msec) at a 1.5 times higher average Cmax (569 ng/mL). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In ALL patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin at the recommended starting dose of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle 
(see section 4.2), steady-state exposure was achieved by Cycle 4. The mean (SD) maximum serum 
concentration (Cmax) of inotuzumab ozogamicin was 308 ng/mL (362). The mean (SD) simulated total area 
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) per cycle at steady state was 100 mcgh/mL (32.9). 
In vitro, the binding of the N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide (DMH) to human plasma 
proteins is approximately 97%. In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin DMH  is a substrate of P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp). In humans, the total volume of distribution of inotuzumab ozogamicin was approximately 12 L.  
In vitro, N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin DMH was primarily metabolised via nonenzymatic reduction. In 
humans, serum N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin DMH levels were typically below the limit of quantitation 
(50 pg/mL).  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin pharmacokinetics were well characterised by a 2-compartment model with linear and 
time-dependent clearance components. In 234 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, the clearance of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin at steady state was 0.0333 L/h, and the terminal elimination half-life (t½) at the end 
of Cycle 4 was approximately 12.3 days. Following administration of multiple doses, a 5.3 times accumulation 
of inotuzumab ozogamicin was observed between Cycles 1 and 4.  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, race, and gender did not significantly affect 
inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition.   
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with hepatic 
impairment.  Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in patients with hepatic impairment defined by National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction

Working Group (NCI ODWG) category B1 (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN; n=133) or B2 (total bilirubin 
> 1.0 1.5 × ULN and AST any level; n=17) was similar to patients with normal hepatic function (total 
bilirubin/AST ≤ ULN; n=611) (see section 4.2). In 3 patients with hepatic impairment defined by NCI ODWG 
category C (total bilirubin > 1.5 3 × ULN and AST any level) and 1 patient with hepatic impairment defined 
by NCI ODWG category D (total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and AST any level), inotuzumab ozogamicin clearance 
did not appear to be reduced (SmPC, section 5.2). 
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin have been conducted in patients with renal 
impairment. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, the clearance of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 89 mL/min; n=237), moderate renal impairment 
(CLcr 30 59 mL/min; n=122), or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 29 mL/min; n=4) was similar to patients 
with normal renal function (CLcr ≥ 90 mL/min; n=402). Inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been studied in 
patients with end stage renal disease (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 765 patients, body surface area was found to significantly 
affect inotuzumab ozogamicin disposition. The dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin is administered based on body 
surface area (SmPC, section 5.2 and 4.2.). 
Based on in vitro data, coadministration of inotuzumab ozogamicin with inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) or uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) drug metabolising enzymes are unlikely to 
alter exposure to N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin DMH. In addition, inotuzumab ozogamicin and N-acetyl 
gamma-calicheamicin DMH are unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of CYP enzymes, and N-acetyl 
gamma-calicheamicin DMH  is unlikely to alter the exposure of substrates of UGT enzymes or major drug 
transporters (SmPC, section 4.5). 
The extent of partitioning of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH into red blood cells was determined in vitro in rat, 
monkey, and human whole blood at a concentration of 1.0 μM (1480 ng/mL). The blood to plasma 
concentration ratios of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH were 0.63, 0.84, and 0.71 in rat, monkey, and human, 
respectively. These data indicated limited distribution of N-Ac-γ-calicheamicin DMH into red blood cells of 
rats, monkeys, and humans.  
The various local tests used in the two ALL clinical studies to screen for CD22 at baseline were not as 
sensitive as the single central laboratory test. Most patients in the ITT population of Study B1930122 were 
≥90% positive per central analysis, making analysis in the other small samples of lower CD22 positivity 
more difficult to interpret. CR/CRi rates showed a statistically significant advantage over control in both those 
≥90% CD22 positivity per central analysis and those ≥70-<90%. A positive trend was seen in the small 
group < 70%. OS was statistically significantly improved in the inotuzumab group compared to control only 
in patients with ≥90% CD22 positivity per central analysis (and ≥70% CD22 positivity by local analysis 
based on ≥70- <90% and ≥90% CD22 positivity groups. The confidence intervals were so wide in the lower 
groups that conclusions could not be drawn. Study B1931022 was not designed to prospectively evaluate the 
benefit of inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to the control within or between subgroups of patients defined 
by CD22 positivity cut-offs.  
Efficacy and safety of Besponsa has not been evaluated in CD22 negative ALL patients and it is expected that 
the presence of the target is essential for the drug to exert an anti-tumour effect therefore CD22-positive 
status is specified in the indication.  There is no clear difference in outcome amongst patients with different 
levels of CD22 positivity so there is no need to specify a minimum level of CD22 expression. 
CD22 expression was assessed using flow cytometry based on bone marrow aspirate. In patients with an 
inadequate bone marrow aspirate sample, a peripheral blood sample was tested. Alternatively, CD22

expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry in patients with an inadequate bone marrow aspirate 
and insufficient circulating blasts (SmPC section 5.1).  
In the clinical study, the sensitivity of some local tests was lower than the central laboratory test. Therefore 
only validated tests with demonstrated high sensitivity should be used (SmPC section 5.1). 
Based on a pharmacokinetic exposure-response analysis in 250 patients with relapsed or refractory ALL or 
other haematological malignancies who received 1.8 mg/m2/cycle inotuzumab ozogamicin administered as 3 
divided doses on Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5 mg/m2) of a 21  to 28 day cycle or 1.8 
mg/m2/cycle administered once every 4 weeks, respectively, the median QTcF increased by 2.53 
milliseconds (msec) from baseline (97.5th percentile: 4.92  msec) at the average Cmax estimated for 
patients with relapsed or refractory ALL (371 ng/mL) and by 3.87 msec from baseline (97.5th percentile: 
7.54 msec) at a 1.5 times higher average Cmax (569 ng/mL) (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Modelling analysis suggested that QTcF prolongation was not likely in ALL patients at the mean Cmax of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin seen in the ALL studies (see discussion on clinical safety). 
The immunogenic potential of inotuzumab ozogamicin is considered to be low. No conclusions can be drawn 
regarding the impact of ADAs on efficacy/safety endpoints due to the limited number of patients involved 
(See discussion on clinical efficacy and clinical safety). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with ALL has been described using a population 
PK model supplemented by PK data obtained from patients with NHL. The pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and related covariates have been reasonably well described and reflected in the SmPC.  The 
CHMP recommended that the results from a study evaluating the extent of partitioning of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (PF-05208773) into red blood cells in vitro in rat, monkey, and human whole blood should be 
submitted by the applicant post-authorisation. 
2.4.6.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.6.1.  Dose response study  
Study B1931010 (referred to as Study 1010) 
This was a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating single-agent inotuzumab 
ozogamicin in patients with CD22 positive relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The study was conducted at 8 
centers in the US between 26 August 2011 and 25 August 2014. The data cut-off date for the CSR was 30 
January 2015 and a supplemental CSR was provided with the final results after the last patient last visit (15 
January 2016). 
The study was divided into: 
Phase 1 
Dose – escalation: Assessed the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy at increasing dose levels of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin to select the RP2D. Evidence of clinical activity was determined by the preliminary

satisfactory response rate after receiving the first dose of study drug, defined as any response other than 
progressive disease (i.e. CR/CRi/PR/resistant disease) 
Dose –expansion cohort: Further evaluated safety and efficacy at the RP2D schedule. 
Phase 2: Evaluated the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin, as measured by the haematologic remission rate 
(CR/CRi by investigator assessment) in patients in second or later salvage setting. Secondary objectives 
included evaluation of overall safety, duration of remission, MRD-negativity (per central laboratory), PFS, OS 
and PK. PD and pharmacogenomics effects were explored. 
Important inclusion criteria: relapsed/ refractory ALL with ≥20% blasts CD22 positive by local laboratory 
assessment. For Phase 2, patients had to be due to receive Salvage 2 therapy and, if Ph+ ALL, had to have 
failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). 
Important exclusion criteria: allogeneic HSCT 4 months before randomization or a history of VOD/SOS.   
Results 
Of 93 screened patients, 72 were assigned to study drug and treated. The median age was 45 years (range 
20-79); 76.4% were Salvage status ≥2; 31.9% had a prior allogenic HSCT and 22.2% were Ph+.The most 
common reasons for treatment discontinuation were: disease progression/ relapse [30 (41.7%)]; resistant 
disease [4 (5.6%)]; HSCT [18 (25.0%)] and adverse events [13 (18.1%)]. 
Phase 1 dose escalation: 24 patients were treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin by IV infusion in 2 or 3 
divided doses over a 28 day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles.

with subsequent dose reduction to 1.6 mg/m2/cycle for patients achieving CR/CRi. The decision to dose-
reduce was based on observed dose delays for patients treated at the 1.8 mg/m2/cycle dose level and 
increased inotuzumab ozogamicin exposure with subsequent doses.

Given the importance of inducing remission quickly, the RP2D was determined to be 1.8 mg/m2/cycle for up 
to 6 cycles with a dose reduction to 1.6 mg/m2/cycle after achieving a CR or CRi (0.8 mg/m2 day 1 and 0.4 
mg/m2 on days 8 and 15).  
Phase 2: 35 patients were treated at the RP2D of inotuzumab ozogamicin.

Study B1931010 completed in 15 January 2016 (last subject last visit), 72 patients had discontinued the 
study; 16 (22.2%) completed 2-year study follow-up, 55 (76.4%) had died and 1 (1.4%) discontinued due to 
‘other’ reasons. Overall, 59/72 (81.9%) patients had PFS events. The median PFS was the same as originally 
reported. The estimated median OS was the same as originally reported overall and in the Phase 2 portion of 
the study. The overall probability of survival at Month 24 was 22.8% (95% CI: 13.9-33.1%) and, in the 
Phase 2 portion, was 12.1% (95% CI: 3.9 -25.5%). 
Duration of remission and overall survival were slightly shorter in the Phase 2 portion of the study compared 
to the total population. Phase 2 had a marginally greater proportion of adverse prognostic factors compared 
to the full population, Salvage ≥2 (91.4% vs. 76.4%), complex cytogenetics (31.4% vs. 20.8%) and prior 
allogenic HSCT (42.9% vs. 31.9%). 
Results from study B1931010 supported further investigation of inotuzumab ozogamicin in CD22 positive 
relapsed/ refractory ALL in the Phase 3 setting.

The study was designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
based on both safety and efficacy parameters. Inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered on a weekly or 
biweekly schedule with a cumulative dose per 28-day cycle of 1.2, 1.6, and 1.8 mg/m2/cycle. One patient 
(out of 9 patients) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of elevated lipase at the 1.8-mg/m2 dose level. 
This DLT occurred after the first dose of 0.8 mg/m2, which was the same initial dose for all 3 dose groups; 
thus, the DLT did not occur due to a higher dose received. There were no discernible differences between the 
1.6- and 1.8-mg/m2 dose groups for gr≥3 hepatic AEs during Cycle 1, with only 1 event of gr3 ALT increased 
in each group.  
Responses (CR/CRi) were observed across all dose levels. Acknowledging small sample sizes, an exploratory 
analysis suggested a potential correlation between dose and MRD negativity. The 1.8-mg/m2/cycle dose level 
had the highest CR/CRi rate of 89% (8/9 patients achieved CR/CRi), and all responding patients achieved 
MRD negativity.   
Adverse Events (AEs) associated with dose delays were reported for 78% of patients in the 1.8-mg/m2/cycle 
cohort. Although a MTD was not formally established, it was concluded that the starting dose/cycle should be 
1.8 mg/m2/cycle based on the importance of inducing a remission quickly. Due to the rate of AEs requiring 
dose delays at this dose level, which limits dose intensity, higher dose levels were not examined, and a dose 
reduction was recommended for subsequent cycles after achievement of remission. PK results from prior NHL 
studies showing increasing exposure to inotuzumab ozogamicin with later cycles of therapy supported a dose 
reduction in subsequent cycles after achievement of remission.  
Therefore, the RP2D was determined to be 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (divided as 0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 
on Days 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle), followed by a dose reduction to 1.6 mg/m2/cycle (0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1 
and 0.4 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) once patients achieved CR or CRi. The dosing regimen 
used in study 1022 and recommended for therapeutic use is presented in Table 25.

B1931022 (1022 Study)  
Methods 
This was an open-label, randomized phase 3 study of inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to a defined 
investigator’s choice in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL). 
Study Participants  
CD22 immuno-phenotyping was performed at screening on bone marrow aspirate (or peripheral blood) by 
local laboratories. If CD22 was negative by local laboratory, the central laboratory result for CD22 
immunophenotyping was considered for eligibility.  Karyotyping was performed locally and cytogenetics 
(FISH) was performed by the central laboratory.

Treatments 
An overview of regimen and follow up for each treatment group is shown in  
Figure 1. 
Figure 1 Study scheme (Study B1931022) 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (0.8 mg/m2 
on Day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle).  For patients who achieved CR/CRi the 
duration of Cycle 1 could be extended up to 28 days.  For patients achieving CR/ CRi, the recommended 
subsequent inotuzumab ozogamicin dose was 1.5mg/m2/cycle (0.5 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day

cycle).  Patients not achieving CR/CRi continued with the dose of 1.8 mg/m2/cycle, split and administered on 
Day 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin was continued until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity up to a maximum of 6 cycles.  
Dose delays 
Dose delays within a cycle were required for non-haematologic toxicity. A minimum of 6 days was to be 
maintained between doses. Dose delay >7 days resulted in omission of the next dose within the cycle. If the 
beginning of the next cycle was delayed by more than 28 days due to treatment -related toxicity, study 
treatment was permanently discontinued unless otherwise agreed by Sponsor and investigator. Following an 
interruption of 14 days due to treatment-related toxicity patients were to resume with a single 25% dose 
reduction for the subsequent cycle (e.g. from 0.5 to 0.375 mg/m2) once adequate recovery was achieved.  If 
further dose modification was indicated, the number of doses within the cycle was to be reduced to 2. 
Following dose reduction for a drug-related toxicity, the dose was not to be re-escalated.   
Dosing with inotuzumab was to be permanently discontinued for any patient with possible, probable or 
confirmed VOD/SOS or other severe liver toxicity.  
Prior to the start of each cycle patients in both arms had to have: 
  No evidence of progressive extramedullary disease (EMD) and a decrease in blast percentage or 
stable disease on the peripheral blood count and bone marrow evaluation 
  Recovery to Grade 1 or baseline non-haematologic treatment-related toxicity  
  Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN (≤2 x ULN if elevated due to tumour) and AST, ALT ≤2.5 x ULN  
  Serum creatinine ≤2 x ULN or estimated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min  
  Recovery of ANC and platelets  
o  For patients with pre-treatment ANC 1 x 109/L: ANC 1 x 109/L; 
o  For patients with pre-treatment platelets 50 x 109/L: platelets 50 x 109/L; 
o  For patients with baseline ANC <1 x 109/L and/or platelets <50 x 109/L: ANC and platelets 
must recover at least to baseline values obtained for the prior cycle, or ANC 1 x 109/L and 
platelets 50 x 109/L, or the most recent bone marrow must demonstrate stable or improved 
disease, and the ANC and platelets are believed to be low due to disease, not test article 
  QTcF ≤470 msec (average ozogamicin of 3 ECGs); Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2 and 4 only  
To reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity, it was recommended to limit treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin to 2 
cycles or the fewest number required to achieve a CR/ CRi (if not achieved after 2 cycles) in patients who 
were proceeding to allogeneic HSCT. A gap of 5-6 weeks from the last dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin to 
HSCT was advocated.  
Dose reductions 
Following an interruption of 14 days due to treatment-related toxicity patients were to resume with a single 
25% dose reduction for the subsequent cycle (e.g. from 0.5 to 0.375 mg/m2) once adequate recovery was 
achieved (Protocol Amendment 3 dated 28 March 2014).  If further dose modification was indicated, the 
number of doses within the cycle was to be reduced to 2 for subsequent cycles.  Dose reduction of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin by 25% was also recommended for patients with CRi, whose platelet counts had not

recovered to those values obtained prior to the start of the previous cycle.  Once a patient had a dose 
reduction for a drug-related toxicity, the dose was not to be re-escalated.  Patients who were unable to 
tolerate a 25% dose reduction followed by a decrease in the number of doses per cycle to 2 doses were 
withdrawn from treatment.   
For patients who were proceeding to allogeneic HSCT, it was recommended that treatment with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin be limited to 2 cycles of induction or the fewest number required to achieve a CR or CRi (if not 
achieved after 2 cycles) in order to potentially reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity, including VOD/SOS, after 
HSCT.  To balance the risk of relapse against the potential risk of toxicity associated with an early alloSCT, a 
gap of 5-6 weeks after the last dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin was considered reasonable.  
Patients had to be weighed within 72 hours prior to every cycle Day 1 and the inotuzumab dose recalculated 
if the weight changed by >10%. If the dose administered was 10% greater or lower than the one prescribed, 
it was reported as a dosing medication error. 
Defined Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy 
Patients randomized to the control arm therefore receive 1 of 3 predefined control chemotherapy regimens: 
FLAG - fludarabine/ cytarabine/ granulocyte-colony stimulating factor for up to 4 cycles (4 weeks per cycle) 
MXN/Ara-C - methotrexate/ cytarabine for up to 4 cycles (15 to 20 days per cycle) or  
HIDAC- high dose cytarabine every 12 hours for up to 12 doses (a second cycle was allowed after 
haematological recovery) 
The dose of defined Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy was reduced when necessary to manage 
treatment-related adverse drug reactions.  Dose reductions or omissions were to be based on institutional 
guidelines or standard of care.   
Study drug(s) could be discontinued in any cycle due to initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (i.e. 
conditioning for HSCT), disease progression, patient refusal or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a suitable 
donor who achieved a response could undergo stem-cell transplantation at the discretion of the investigator. 
Other therapy during study 
Hydroxyurea was permitted for temporary control of elevated white blood cell counts in patients with 
aggressive disease both prior to and during the first 5 days of study treatment (both arms, first cycle only).  
Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis/treatment (e.g. intrathecal methotrexate) was strongly encouraged.  
Growth factors such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), including pegfilgrastim, and 
granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and corticosteroids were allowed if clinically 
indicated.   
Other anti-cancer treatments were prohibited during active treatment but allowed post end-of-treatment 
(EOT) visit. Craniospinal radiation (CSXRT) was prohibited during study treatment. Medications known to 
predispose to Torsades de Pointes were prohibited; if considered medically necessary to treat a life-
threatening condition, the Sponsor had to be notified immediately, and additional ECGs may be required prior 
to re-dosing with study drug.

Objectives 
The two primary objectives included the comparison of haematological remission and the comparison of 
overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL randomized to receive inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (Arm A) versus patients randomized to receive active comparator (Arm B). 
Secondary objectives included comparison of the rate of HSCT and the rate of VOD following HSCT between 
inotuzumab ozogamicin and the active comparator arm and to determine the population pharmacokinetic 
parameters of inotuzumab ozogamicin and confirm sources of exposure variability. 
Exploratory objectives included determination of the relationship between inotuzumab ozogamicin exposure 
and efficacy, inotuzumab ozogamicin plasma concentration and QTcF interval the effect of exposure on 
circulating micro RNA.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The two primary endpoints were haematological remission (CR/CRi) per blinded external independent 
endpoint adjudication committee (EAC) and OS. 
CR was defined as a disappearance of leukaemia as indicated by <5% marrow blasts and the absence of 
peripheral blood leukaemic blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by ANC 1000/µL and platelets 
100,000/µL. CRi was defined as CR except with ANC <1000/µL and/or platelet counts <100,000/µL. C1 
extramedullary disease (EMD) status was required and assessed using the same technique as at baseline. 
Response was determined in a step-wise manner by the EAC according the EAC Charter: pathologists 
reviewed the slides and, if the patient had <5% blasts in the bone marrow, haematologists reviewed the 
radiology reports and then, if applicable, blood counts to determine CR vs. CRi. 
Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to any cause.  
Patients without an OS event, including those who withdrew from study refusing further follow-up, were 
censored at the last known alive date. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
  CR/CRi per Investigator’s assessment  
  MRD-negativity – lowest value of MRD minimal residual disease  from first date of CR/CRi (CR 
complete remission ; CRi complete remission with partial haematological recovery rate) to EOT <1 x 
10-4 blasts/nucleated cells by flow cytometry per central laboratory analysis (Genoptix, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) 
  DoR - Duration of Remission , defined as the time from date of first remission (CR/CRi) to 
progression or death 
  Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Rate 
 
PFS - time from date of randomization to earliest date of any of the following - progressive disease 
(including investigator determined clinical progression, relapse from CR/CRi, treatment 
discontinuation due to global health deterioration); death from any cause; starting new induction 
therapy or post-therapy HSCT without achieving CR/CRi 
 
PROs: Patient Reported Outcomes  Health-related quality of life and health status as measured by the 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30,

Version 3.0) and the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire were collected at baseline (Cycle 1, 
Day 1), Day 1 of each subsequent cycle and at the end of treatment. They were completed prior to 
any tests or discussion of progress with healthcare personnel. 
Disease assessment involved bone marrow evaluation and information from laboratory, clinical and 
radiological assessment performed at Day 16 to 28 of Cycles 1, 2, and 3, then every 1 to 2 cycles and at the 
EOT visit and whenever clinically indicated. For patients who had not progressed at EOT, disease was 
assessed every 12 weeks for up to 1 year from randomization and every 24 weeks between Year 1 and 2, 
until relapse.  All patients were followed for survival every 3 months following discontinuation of study 
treatment for up to 5 years or 2 years after randomization of the last patient, whichever occurred first. 
Patients who underwent HSCT were followed for disease progression and survival. Potential VOD/SOS cases, 
irrespective of grade, causality or treatment arm were reported for up to 2 years from randomization. 
Patients without a PFS event at time of analysis were censored at the last valid disease assessment. In 
addition, patients with documentation of a PFS event after an interval >28 weeks (if there was post baseline 
disease assessment), or >12 weeks (if there was no post baseline assessment) since the previous disease 
assessment were censored at the time of the previous assessment (date of randomization if no post baseline 
assessment). Post-study treatment follow-up disease assessments were included. 
Sample size 
For the CR/CRi endpoint, 218 patients gave at least 88.5% power to detect a difference of response 
probabilities between 61% in the inotuzumab vs. 37% in the control arm for one-sided alpha=0.0125 for 
each analysis. 
The study was also designed to detect a clinically meaningful difference in OS (hazard ratio 0.67 
corresponding to medians 4.30 months on comparator arm and 6.45 months on investigational arm) with 
80% power for one-sided alpha=0.0125. Assuming accrual of 2 patients per month for the first 6 months and 
9.33 patients per month thereafter, approximately 3 months of follow-up after the last patient is accrued, 
20% dropout within 15 days, 25% dropout total on the control arm and 5% dropout total on the InO arm, 
then a total sample size of 325 patients was required.  
It was planned to randomize at least 218 patients, unless stopped earlier by the eDMC, over approximately 
29 months for the CR/CRi endpoint. An additional 107 patients (325 patients total) were to be randomized 
for determination of OS in approximately 12 more months. If accrual was not complete one year after the 
second interim analysis, the study could be stopped short of the planned 325 patients. The original sample 
size was increased from 292 patients (see Protocol Amendment 3).The number of patients randomized who 
were due to receive Salvage 2 was capped at a third of the entire trial population and the number of patients 
with Philadelphia chromosome positive disease was capped at approximately 20% of the entire trial 
population. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the investigational treatment of single-agent inotuzumab 
ozogamicin or defined Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy (FLAG, MXN/Ara-C or HIDAC). Once chosen, 
patients randomized to the comparator arm (Arm B) may not switch to an alternative investigator’s choice 
therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 66/133 
 
  
  
 
Randomization was stratified by 3 prognostic factors: duration of first remission (<12 vs ≥12 months), line of 
salvage (Salvage 1 vs 2) and patient age at randomization (<55 vs ≥ 55 years).  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study.  
Statistical methods 
There was no control of type I error across secondary endpoints, which were tested at 1-sided 0.025 (2-sided 
0.05). 
Two interim analyses of OS were planned and reviewed by an independent external Data Monitoring 
Committee (e-DMC).  
The first interim analysis was planned to assess futility only and the trial could not be stopped for efficacy at 
the first interim analysis. Assuming the interim analysis occurred at exactly 62 events, the trial could be 
stopped for futility if the p-value was greater than 0.61 (corresponding to hazard ratio of >1.07). 
The second interim analysis was planned to assess futility and efficacy when at least 60% of the target OS 
events were observed and was to be considered the final OS analysis if the pre-specified efficacy boundary 
was crossed. Assuming the interim analysis occurred at exactly 149 events, the trial could be stopped for 
futility if the p-value was greater than 0.17 (corresponding to hazard ratio of >0.86) or for efficacy if the p-
value was less than 0.003 (corresponding to hazard ratio of <0.64). 
The second interim analysis of OS was conducted based on a data cutoff date of 19 January 2015 when 163 
OS events had occurred in 326 randomized patients.  The e-DMC reviewed the results on 11 March 2015 and 
recommended the study to continue as planned. 
Adjusting for the interim analysis the final analysis for OS was conducted using 1-sided p=0.0104 as the cut-
off (equivalent to 2-sided p=0.0208). 
Haematological remission 
The final analysis of CR/CRi was planned for after the first 218 patients had been followed for at least 3 
months post-randomization. Patients who did not achieve CR/CRi, including patients who did not receive 
study treatment, were considered as non-responders. CR/CRi rates were compared between the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin arm and the control arm using the Chi-square  test or Fisher’s exact test (if any cell size was 
under 5) at 1-sided α=0.0125 significance level. For each treatment arm, the CR/CRi rate along with the 
95% confidence interval (CI) around the rate was computed. The estimate of the difference in CR/CRi rate 
between the 2 treatment arms and its 97.5% CI was computed. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the robustness of the primary analysis, CR/CRi per EAC 
assessment, including analysis of the following populations: mITT218, PP218 and ITT218 assuming all 
untreated patients are responders. Logistic regression multiple imputation analyses (missing at random 
[MAR] and missing not at random [MNAR]) and a weighted Chi-square test were conducted. The latter 
applied weights on each patient in the mITT218 population based on their probability of early drop-out, 
aiming to mitigate the impact on the response analysis resulting from the early dropouts without treatment 
in the defined Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm (B) compared with no early dropout in the 
inotuzumab arm (A). All patients in the Arm B of mITT218 population were given equal weight of 1; while for 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 67/133 
 
  
  
 
Arm A lower weights were given to patients whose baseline characteristics predisposed them to higher 
probability of early dropout had they been randomized to the control arm. 
The potential correlation between CR/CRi and intrinsic and extrinsic baseline factors were evaluated in 
mITT218 Population using logistic regression to include the treatment arm and the following covariates: age, 
race (white, other), gender, disease characteristics (blasts %), ECOG performance scores (0/1, >1), baseline 
HRQoL (standardized global health/QoL score), duration of first remission (<1 year, ≥1 year), salvage 
treatment (Salvage 1, 2), response to most recent prior regimen (CR, other), cytogenetics (normal, other) 
and absolute circulating blasts. 
An additional set of sensitivity analyses were conducted using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified 
by stratification factors at randomization. This was performed for both CR/CRi per EAC and CR/CRi per 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Overall survival  
Final OS analysis was planned for when approximately 248 required events were observed in 326 randomized 
patients.  OS was analysed based on the log-rank test and the hazard ratio and corresponding 97.5% 2-sided 
confidence interval using stratified Cox proportional hazard regression presented. The median OS was 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and reported with 2 sided 97.5% confidence intervals for each 
arm.

Recruitment 
A total of 444 patients were screened at centres across Europe, America, Asia and Australia. Of these, 326 
were randomized (N=164 to inotuzumab ozogamicin and N=162 to the control chemotherapy arm i.e. the 
ITT population). The first subject first visit was 2 August 2012 and the last patient was randomized on 4 
January 2015.

Within the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, medication errors per protocol definition (administered dose 10% 
higher or lower than the prescribed dose) were reported for 15 patients. No single doses of inotuzumab >0.8 
mg/m2 or total doses of >1.8 mg/m2 in a 21 day period were administered. Dose delays for AEs (mostly 
hepatic and haematological) were not implemented for 20 patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm. Re-
dosing in the setting of elevated liver enzymes was reported for 10 patients. Among these, two patients were 
dosed with an elevated bilirubin. Both patients proceeded to HSCT and developed Grade 3 and Grade 4 VOD, 
respectively.  
Ten patients with protocol deviations regarding eligibility criteria were excluded from the PP Population; 9 did 
not meet the first eligibility criterion (<20% CD22 blast positivity per local laboratory assessment, due 
Salvage 3 therapy, <5% blasts in the BM). One patient in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm was not eligible 
per the Sponsor’s assessment due to multi-agent chemotherapy (EPOCH) administered after a second 
relapse while awaiting study enrolment. This therapy was considered a salvage induction regimen by the 
Sponsor (Salvage 3) but maintenance by the Investigator. One patient was not withdrawn from the study at 
the end of Cycle 1 following progressive disease, but continued inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment until the 
end of Cycle 3.  
Baseline data 
For the ITT Population, the majority of patients were male (193/326 [59.2%]) and White (232/326 [71.2%]). 
The median age was 47.0 years (range 18 to 79 years). A higher percentage of patients were aged 65 years

or over in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm than in the control arm (18.3% vs 13.6%). The median weight 
was 74.0 kg (range 40.0 to 192.0 kg). 
In the safety population, a total of 29 (17.7%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 26 (18.2%) 
patients in the control arm had a pre-study HSCT.

In the mITT326 population, the CR/CRi rate per investigator was 73.2% (95% CI: 65.7-79.8) in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with 35% (95% CI: 27.2-43.4) in the control arm.  The rate 
difference was 38.2% (97.5% CI: 26.4-50.0) (1-sided p<0.0001 [Chi-square test]).

In the ITT218 Population, in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared to the control arm the CR/CRi rate 
was 82.4% versus 36.5% and 81.0% versus 16.7% for patients who had ≥90% or ≥70% to <90% CD22-
positive leukaemic blasts at baseline, respectively. In the control arm the CR/CRi rate was 33.3% for patients 
who had <70% CD22-positive leukaemic blasts at baseline. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, only 3 
patients had <70% CD22-positive leukaemic blasts at baseline so comparison for CR/CRi was not conducted.  
In the ITT218 population, 13 patients who were randomized to the defined Investigator’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm refused to be treated.  A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the potential 
impact of these drop-outs on the analysis of CR/CRi by assuming that all untreated patients are responders. 
Assuming that the 13 patients that refused treatment in the control arm were responders, was highly

Results in the mITT218 population (where the untreated patients were excluded) were consistent with those 
from the ITT128. The CR rate (per EAC) was 35.8% (95% CI: 26.8, 45.5) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm 
compared with 19.8% (95% CI: 12.4, 29.2) in the control arm. The rate difference was 16.0% (97.5% CI:

In the PP population, the CR rate (per EAC) was 35.8% (95% CI: 26.8, 45.7) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
arm compared with 20.0% (95% CI: 12.3, 29.8) in the control arm. The rate difference was 15.8% (97.5% 
CI: 1.8, 29.9) and was statistically significant (1-sided p=0.0072). The CRi rate (per EAC) was 46.2% (95% 
CI: 36.5, 56.2) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with 14.4% (95% CI: 7.9, 23.4) in the control

An exploratory post-hoc analysis based on the RMST method and 08 March 2016 data cutoff date was 
conducted. A truncation time (τ) of 37.7 months was chosen as the minimum of the maximum OS time in 
the 2 arms of the study. The restricted mean OS time was 13.9 months (standard error [SE]: 1.1) in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 9.9 months (SE: 0.85) in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm 
which resulted in a difference in restricted mean OS time between arms of 3.9 months with a 1-sided p-value 
of 0.0023 (data not shown).

Population- Study B1931022 (2 October 2014 data cutoff date) 
Duration of remission (DoR) 
In the ITT218 population (8 March 2016 data cutoff), the median duration of remission in patients who 
achieved CR/CRi was longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin group (84 patients) than the chemotherapy 
control (32 patients [5.4months (95% CI 4.2, 8.0months) vs. 3.5months (95% CI 2.9, 6.6months)] .  
The median DoR in the ITT218 population (i.e. initial 218 patients randomized) was 4.2 months (95% CI: 
3.0-5.2) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 0.0 months (95% CI: NA-NA) in the control arm.  The 
observed HR was 0.395 (95% CI: 0.285-0.547) with 1-sided p<0.0001 based on the stratified analysis using 
the stratification factors at randomization. The median DoR in the ITT population (08 March 2016 data cutoff 
date for the analysis with patients without remission being given a duration of zero and considered an event) 
was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.8-4.3) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 0.0 months (95% CI: NA-NA) in 
the control arm. The observed HR was 0.468 (95% CI: 0.363-0.603) with 1-sided p<0.0001 based on the

Table 49 : Study B1930122: Kaplan-Meier Plots of Overall Survival in Patients who received a 
Follow-Up HSCT – ITT Population (8 March 2016 data cutoff date) 
Among responders, 92/120 (76.7%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 36/50 (72%) patients in 
the control arm were still in remission by the end of treatment assessment (08 March 2016 data cutoff date). 
Of these, 65/92 (70.6%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 16/36 (44.4%) patients in the 
control arm received HSCT after study therapy. More patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin than in the 
control arm proceeded to HSCT after study therapy i.e. without another intervening induction therapy and 
regardless of CR/CRi status.  In the ITT population, 71/164 (43.3%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
arm and 18/162 (11.1%) patients in the control arm proceeded to HSCT after study treatment (p<0.0001). 
In the Besponsa arm, 6/77 (7.8%) and, in the control arm, 15/33 (45.5%) patients were transplanted after a 
new induction. 
The time from HSCT to recurrence or death was analyzed in two patient populations: firstly, patients who 
received follow-up HSCT before the start of new induction therapy (PTPFS1) and, secondly, all patients who 
received follow-up HSCT regardless of the start of new induction therapy (PTPFS2).

Fifty-one patients who received Besponsa achieved CR/CRi not followed by transplant (08 March 2016 data 
cutoff date).  Of these, 18 received 1-3 cycles and 33 patients, 4 to 6 cycles. The latter group (N=33) had 
longer DOR and OS than the former. Although not statistically significant, responders who received a 
maximum of 4 to 6 cycles had numerically higher median DoR and OS compared to responders who received 
a maximum of 1 to 3 cycles (median DoR of 4.2 and 2.5 months, respectively; median OS of 8.0 and 5.3 
months, respectively).

In the analysis of PFS where switch of therapy is not considered an event (8 March 2016 data cutoff date), a 
standard definition of PFS was used. In the ITT Population, the estimated HR (inotuzumab ozogamicin versus 
the control arm) was in line with the reported results of the PFS that was pre-defined in the protocol [HR 
=0.535 (97.5% CI: 0.376-0.761; 1-sided p <0.0001) based on the stratified analysis]. The median PFS was 
5.6 months (95% CI: 4.9-6.3) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm versus 3.6 months (95% CI: 2.3-4.1) in 
the control arm.

EORTC QLQ-C30:  
For patient-reported outcomes, most functioning and symptoms scores were in favour of BESPONSA 
compared to Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. For patient-reported outcomes measured using the

For patient-reported outcomes measured using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire, although 
not reaching statistical significance, BESPONSA resulted in better estimated mean postbaseline scores 
(BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively) for the EQ-5D index (0.80 versus 0.76;

Overall missing data were slightly above 20% with substantial imbalance between the 2 treatment arms in 
terms of missing data, with 35% missing in the control arm compared with 15% in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin. MNAR is assumed, due to the likely poorer health status of the control arm patients.

Supportive study 
Study B1931010  
Study B1931010 was a single-arm, multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 clinical study evaluating single-agent 
inotuzumab ozogamicin in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL.  
Eligible patients were male or female, 18 years or older, with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive ALL 
(20% blasts were CD22 positive by local assessment). For the Phase 2 part of the study, the patients must 
have been due to receive Salvage 2 therapy. Patients with Ph+ ALL were to have failed treatment with at 
least 1 TKI. Patients were to have adequate organ function and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 3. 
Patients were excluded from the study if they had isolated extramedullary relapse or active CNS leukaemia. 
In addition, patients who received chemotherapy within 2 weeks before their first dose of study treatment, 
monoclonal antibodies within 6 weeks of treatment, or allogeneic HSCT or other anti-CD22 immunotherapy 
4 months before randomization, or had evidence or history of VOD/SOS were excluded. 
Of 93 screened patients, 72 patients were assigned to study drug and treated with BESPONSA. The median 
age was 45 years (range 20-79); 76.4% were Salvage status ≥ 2; 31.9% had received a prior HSCT and 
22.2% were Ph+. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were: disease 
progression/relapse (30 [41.7%)], resistant disease (4 [5.6%]); HSCT (18 [25.0%]), and adverse events (13 
[18.1%]) (SmPC section 5.1).  
In the Phase 1 portion of the study, 37 patients received BESPONSA at a total dose of 1.2 mg/m2 (n=3), 1.6 
mg/m2 (n=12), or 1.8 mg/m2 (n=22). The recommended BESPONSA dose was determined to be 1.8

mg/m2/cycle administered at a dose of 0.8 mg/m2 on Day 1 and 0.5 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15 of a 28 day 
cycle with a dose reduction upon achieving CR/Cri (SmPC section 5.1).  
In the Phase 2 portion of the study, patients had to have received at least 2 prior treatment regimens for ALL 
and patients with Ph+ B cell ALL had to have failed treatment with at least 1 TKI. Of the 9 patients with Ph+ 
B-cell ALL, 1 patient had received 1 previous TKI and 1 patient had received no prior TKIs (SmPC section 
5.1).

2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial was an open label Phase 3 Study (B1931022) that randomised patients with CD-922 positive 
relapsed/ refractory B-cell ALL to inotuzumab ozogamicin or investigator’s choice of chemotherapy from one 
of 3 pre-defined regimens (FLAG, MN/Ara-C or HIDAC). The choice of the control arm  after randomisation 
may potentially result in bias; however in the view of the clear difference between the 2 arms it can be 
considered that this uncertainty has no impact on the demonstration of efficacy. 
There was no standard of care for Ph- relapsed/ refractory B cell ALL at the time that the trial was initiated, 
so the control arm is acceptable, although Blincyto has since been authorised in the EU. The proportion of 
patients with Ph+ disease was capped at 20% of the full trial population. Ph+ patients also had to have failed 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 103/133 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
treatment with at least 1 second or third generation TKI and standard multi-agent induction chemotherapy. 
Of 49 patients Ph+ ALL, 4 did not receive a prior TKI and 28 received only 1 prior TKI. This was in line with 
the protocol but the ESMO guidelines recommend that Ph+ patients with persistent MRD or progressive 
disease switch to another TKI while screening for TKI resistance mutations and adapt the TKI choice 
according to the resistance profile. 
To reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity, inotuzumab ozogamicin was limited to 2 cycles, or the smallest number 
necessary to achieve CR/CRi, in patients who were continuing to allogeneic HSCT. Patients with a history of 
VOD or HSCT in the previous 4 months were excluded.  
The two co-primary endpoints (haematological remission and OS) are appropriate. As this is an open-label 
trial the primary analysis of CR/CRi was based upon the assessment of the blinded external Endpoint 
Adjudication Committee (EAC). This was conducted, as pre-specified in the first 218 randomised patients, the 
ITT218 population. More patients allocated to the control arm (13 in the ITT218 population) withdrew before 
receiving treatment. Therefore, the mITT218, where these untreated patients are excluded, is important to 
ensure that any apparent efficacy is not due to these early withdrawals.  
To control multiplicity the alpha was split equally between the two primary endpoints, both of which were 
tested at the 1-sided 0.0125 level. Therefore, technically, the study is positive if either primary endpoint is 
positive. As it is required that both primary endpoints are positive, each could have been tested at the full 
5% level (1-sided 0.025). Two interim analyses were planned and reviewed by an independent external Data 
Monitoring Committee (e-DMC). The second interim analysis assessed efficacy so adjustment was required 
and the final analysis for OS was conducted using 1-sided p=0.0104 as the cut-off (equivalent to 2-sided 
p=0.0208). As it is required that both primary endpoints are positive, after adjusting for the interim analysis, 
testing at 1-sided p=0.0229 could be allowed while still controlling the type I error at conventional levels.  
Protocol deviations mainly involved the inclusion/ exclusion criteria and drug dosing. These should not have 
an impact on the interpretation of the efficacy results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There was a statistically significant improvement in the first primary endpoint, the rate of haematological 
remission with inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to control. In the ITT218 population, the CR/CRi rate (per 
EAC assessment) was 80.7% in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 29.4% in the defined Investigator’s 
choice of chemotherapy arm (rate difference = 51.4% [97.5% CI: 38.4, 64.3%], Chi-square test 1-sided p-
value<0.0001). The results in the mITT 218 population (excluded untreated patients), PP218 population and 
per investigator assessment were similar to and supported the primary analysis. A statistically significant 
improvement with inotuzumab ozogamicin was maintained when CR and CRi were analysed separately and in 
the sensitivity analysis where the patients that withdrew prior to treatment in the chemotherapy arm were 
designated as responders.  
The improvement in CR/CRi rate per EAC was consistent across the pre-specified stratification subgroups 
(duration of first remission, line of salvage and age at randomization). Using the logistic regression model to 
control for the baseline covariates, the effect of treatment (inotuzumab ozogamicin versus control) on CR/CRi 
(per EAC) was statistically significant in the mITT218 population (2-sided p<0.0001). Apart from treatment, 
response to most recent prior regimen (estimate -1.1; 2-sided p=0.0883) was the baseline covariate 
associated with the greatest predictive value for CR/CRi (per EAC) outcome in the mITT218 population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 104/133 
 
  
  
 
Refractory ALL has a worse prognosis than relapsed disease; the statistically significant improvement in CR/ 
CRi rates for inotuzumab ozogamicin over control was maintained in the refractory population (70.0% vs. 
14.3%; rate difference 55.7% (97.5% CI 32.7-78.7%). 
Results of subgroup analysis of CR/CRi were consistent with the primary analysis;a numerical benefit was 
seen in those who were Ph+ and with prior HSCT. Only patients with t(4,11) translocation did not show a 
benefit with inotuzumab ozogamicin but this involved very small numbers (3 vs. 6 patients) and is known to 
carry a poor prognosis.  
For the second primary endpoint OS there was not a statistically significant improvement in median OS for 
inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to the chosen chemotherapy regimens (7.7 vs. 6.7 months) according to 
the pre-specified cut-off level of 1-sided p<0.0104 (adjusted for the interim analysis) [stratified HR 0.770 
(97.5% CI 0.578, 1.026), p=0.0203]. However, the planned testing strategy is over-conservative. If both 
primary endpoints are tested at 1-sided p<0.025, the OS result could be considered to be positive while still 
controlling the type I error at conventional levels (required 1-sided p<0.0229 after adjusting for the interim 
analysis). Additional weighted comparisons were conducted using different weight functions. The Fleming-
Harrington, which places more weight on late observations, was found to be most appropriate, given the 
distribution of the observed OS data, with late separation of the survival curves; this resulted in statistical 
significance (1 sided p =0.0101). The mITT analysis of OS, confirmed the statistically significant OS result 
when using the 1-sided p-value boundary of 0.0229 (HR of 0.767 [97.5% CI: 0.572-1.029] and 1-sided 
p=0.0209. The OS rate at 2- years favoured inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Overall survival showed an improvement in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with the control arm 
with respect to all stratification factors per IVRS examined (duration of first remission [<12 months or ≥12 
months], salvage status [Salvage 1 or 2] and age at randomization [<55 years or ≥55 years]). In general, 
patients with more favourable prognostic factors had a better survival outcome. Using Cox regression 
modelling, in the univariate analyses, baseline characteristics associated with lower risk of death in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (2-sided p<0.05) were younger age (<55 years), Salvage 1, duration of first 
remission ≥12 months and baseline leukaemic blast CD22 positivity per central laboratory ≥90%. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin allowed more patients to proceed directly to HSCT. Overall, 77/164 (47.0%) patients 
in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 33/162 (20.4%) patients in the Investigator’s choice of 
chemotherapy arm had a follow-up HSCT. This included 71 and 18 patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
and control arm, respectively, who proceeded directly to HSCT and 6 and 15 patients respectively who were 
transplanted after a new induction. The OS improvement for inotuzumab ozogamicin over control was seen in 
patients who underwent HSCT, although there was an excess of early deaths post-transplant (pre 100 days) 
in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, a late survival benefit was evident. It was not possible to draw 
conclusions regarding the subgroup that proceeded directly to HSCT without further induction therapy due to 
the small number of patients in the control arm.  
Some of the documentation relating to HSCT was poor so answers had to be surmised or extrapolated rather 
than obtained directly. This included the reason that an individual in CR/CRi did not proceed to HSCT and the 
number of transplant-related deaths. Possible reasons why relatively more of the patients in remission 
underwent HSCT in the experimental arm (70.6% vs. 44.4%) included more ongoing Grade ≥3 TEAEs (66% 
vs. 50%) and Grade ≥3 infections (20% vs. 5.8%) and a shorter duration of remission (3.6 months [95% 
CI: 2.9-5.2]) vs. 5.3 months [95% CI: 4.2-7.0]) in the control arm.  In a retrospective analysis of OS, 
deaths after follow-up HSCT not due to documented relapse were considered as transplant-related deaths 
and censored. In this population the improvement with inotuzumab was more marked. The median OS 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 105/133 
 
  
  
 
censored for transplant-related deaths was 11.5 months (95% CI: 8.0-13.3) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
arm and 6.7 months (95% CI: 4.9-8.4) in the control arm [estimated HR = 0.634 (97.5% CI: 0.464-0.868), 
1-sided p-value = 0.0005 based on the stratified analysis]. Therefore, although there is a benefit in OS in the 
full population, this is small due to the increased early transplant related mortality. 
More patients in the control arm received follow up induction therapy (51.9% vs. 29.9%), although the 
proportions receiving any follow-up systemic therapy were similar in both arms (66.0% vs. 71.3%). 
Sensitivity analyses of OS censored at the time when a patient received a specific post-study therapy 
(blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, any induction ALL therapy or HSCT) were consistent with an OS 
benefit for inotuzumab ozogamicin over control.  
Duration of remission in those who achieved CR/CRi was longer with inotuzumab ozogamicin. DoR results 
were consistent in the analyses of the ITT218 and ITT populations that included all patients, with patients 
without remission being given a duration of zero. 
Median PFS was clinically and statistically significantly longer in the inotuzumab ozogamicin than the control 
arm [5.0 months (95% CI 3.7, 5.6) vs. 1.8 months (1.5, 2.2), stratified HR 0.452 (97.5% CI 0.336, 0.609) 
1-sided p value <0.0001]. The curves separated early, before 3 months. In the standard definition of PFS, 
where switch of therapy was not considered an event, the median PFS was 5.6 months and 3.6 months in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin and the control arm, respectively. It is possible that switch of therapy, which was 
more frequent in the control arm, explains the longer median PFS according to the standard censoring. 
The median number of cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin was 3. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (ITT, N= 
326, population), 70.8%, 25.8% and 3.3% of patients who achieved CR/CRi first achieved remission (CR or 
CRi) in Cycles 1, 2, and 3, respectively. No responding patient first achieved remission (CR or CRi) after 
Cycle 3. For patients who achieved CR/CRi but did not undergo follow-up HSCT responders who received a 
maximum of 4 to 6 cycles had numerically higher median DoR and OS compared to responders who received 
a maximum of 1 to 3 cycles (median DoR of 4.2 and 2.5 months, respectively; median OS of 8.0 and 5.3 
months, respectively). Therefore, it is appropriate that patients who do not achieve CR/CRi stop after 2 (or a 
maximum of 3 cycles); patients who achieve CR/CRi but do not continue to HSCT could receive a maximum 
of 6 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin.  
For patient-reported outcomes, most functioning and symptoms scores were in favour of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin compared to Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy. For patient-reported outcomes measured 
using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ-C30), inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in significantly better estimated mean postbaseline 
scores (inotuzumab ozogamicin and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively) in role functioning 
(64.7 versus 53.4; p=0.0065), physical functioning (75.0 versus 68.1; p=0.0139), social functioning (68.1 
versus 59.8; p=0.0336), and appetite loss (17.6 versus 26.3; p=0.0193) compared to Investigator’s choice 
of chemotherapy. Although not reaching statistical significance, inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in better 
estimated mean postbaseline scores (inotuzumab ozogamicin and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, 
respectively) in global health status/Quality of Life (QoL) (62.1 versus 57.8; p=0.1572), cognitive functioning 
(85.3 versus 82.5; p=0.1904), dyspnoea (14.7 versus 19.4; p=0.1281), diarrhoea (5.9 versus 8.9; 
p=0.1534), fatigue (35.0 versus 39.4; p=0.1789), nausea and vomiting (8.7 versus 10.4; p=0.4578), 
financial difficulties (29.5 versus 32.0; p=0.4915), insomnia (25.4 versus 27.1; p=0.6207), and pain (21.3 
versus 22.0; p=0.8428). Although not reaching statistical significance, inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in 
worse estimated mean post-baseline scores (inotuzumab ozogamicin and Investigator’s choice of

chemotherapy, respectively) in emotional functioning (77.4 versus 79.6; p=0.3307) and constipation (12.1 
versus 10.7; p=0.6249) (SmPC section 5.1). 
For patient-reported outcomes measured using the EuroQoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire, although 
not reaching statistical significance, inotuzumab ozogamicin resulted in better estimated mean postbaseline 
scores (BESPONSA and Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy, respectively) for the EQ-5D index (0.80 
versus 0.76; p=0.1710) and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) (67.1 versus 62.5; p=0.1172) (SmPC 
section 5.1).  
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Data from pivotal study B1931022 showed a clinically significant response rate of haematological remission 
(CR/CRi) in adults with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia compared to investigators 
choice of chemotherapy. These results are further supported by a 1 month improvement in median OS 
compared to control and the high rates of negative MRD responses observed. 
The clinical efficacy data available are adequate to support the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin adults with 
relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor ALL. Adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome 
positive (Ph+) relapsed or refractory ALL should have previously failed treatment with at least one tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (TKI). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
As of 08 March 2016 cut-off (updated analysis), a total of 1207 patients were treated in Pfizer-sponsored 
studies (Phases 1 to 3), including 880 patients who received at least 1 dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin. Of 
these 880 patients, 236 with relapsed or refractory ALL and 173 with NHL were exposed to single agent 
inotuzumab ozogamicin; 212 ALL patients (164 in Study 1022 and 48 in Study 1010) received inotuzumab 
ozogamicin at the recommended starting dose of 1.8mg/m2; An updated analysis of safety from the Phase 3 
study was included in the sCSR, with an additional 25 patients in the inotuzumab arm (N=164, 8 March 2016 
cut-off). The information below is from the initial MAA unless otherwise specified.

a. 
The pooled data contains additional Study 1010 reductions.  Study 1010 relied on sites indicating a dose reduction in 
the CRF. In Study 1022, sites needed to indicate dose reductions in the CRF, but in instances where this was not indicated, a ≥ 
10% reduction based on actual dose levels were counted as dose reductions.  The pooled data used the Study 1022 approach 
applied to both studies. 
b. 
Only 4 cycles of FLAG and MXN/Ara-C, and 2 cycles of HIDAC were allowed per protocol. 
In study b1931022 (updated analysis, 08 March 2016 data cutoff), the median total dose of inotuzumab 
ozogamicin was 4.215mg/m2 (range 0.78 to 9.59 mg/m2); the median dose intensity was 1.575mg/m2/cycle 
(range 0.77 to 2.06 mg/m2/cycle) based on the proposed cycle lengths. 
Adverse events 
All AEs were coded according to MedDRA Version 17.1 with severity grade defined by the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined 
as all causality AEs that began on or after C1D1 but within 42 days of the last dose of study drug and 
included all treatment-related AEs after C1D1 as well as VOD/SOS within 2 years of randomization.

In study b1931022 (updated analysis, 08 March 2016 data cutoff),  AEs associated with permanent 
discontinuations, temporary discontinuations/dose delays and dose reductions were more frequent in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm; however, the median duration of treatment was longer in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (8.9weeks, 3 cycles) than in the control arm (0.9 weeks, 1 cycle).   
TEAEs associated with treatment delay were reported for 43.9% (72/164) patients in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin arm and 11.9% (17/143)of patients in the control. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm these 
TEAEs included neutropenia (17.1%), thrombocytopenia ((9.8%)), febrile neutropenia (4.9%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (4.3%) increased AST (4.3%%), increased GGT (4.3%), and increased ALT (3.0%).  
TEAEs that led to dose reductions were reported in 5 patients (3.0%) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 
3  (2.1%) in the control arm. In the updated analysis (08 March 2016), a total of 7 (4.3%) time to dose 
reduction (TTDR) events were observed for Besponsa and 5 (3.5%) in the control arm. The median TTDR 
was not reached. The KM curve suggests that the time to dose reduction was generally longer for patients in 
the experimental arm compared to control. In the safety population, the stratified HR for the TTDR was 0.183 
(97.5% CI: 0.035-0.955). The ascribed reasons for dose reduction were provided (neutropenia and sepsis, 
VOD/SOS, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage, elevated liver enzymes).

The TEAEs that increased in frequency by ≥5% from the 02 October 2014 to 08 March 2016 data cutoff dates 
included hyperbilirubinaemia (all grades: 15.1% vs 21.3%, respectively; Grade ≥3: 3.6% vs 6.1%, 
respectively) and pyrexia (all grades: 26.6% vs 31.7%, respectively; Grade ≥3: 3.6% vs 3.0%, 
respectively). Some of the increases in hyperbilirubinaemia were due to late reporting of this AE and some 
were due to new events. In the control arm, the frequency of hyperbilirubinaemia also increased in frequency 
by ≥5% (10.0% vs 16.8%, respectively) for similar reasons.  
In study b1931022 (updated analysis, 08 March 2016), the most common (≥5%) Grades ≥3 all-causality 
TEAEs the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm in Study B1931022 included neutropenia (47.0 %), thrombocytopenia 
(40.9%), leukopenia (26.8%), febrile neutropenia (26.8%), anaemia (22.6%), lymphopenia (16.5%), VOD 
(11.0%), increased GGT (11.0%), hypokalaemia (6.7%) and decreased WBC count (6.1%). During Cycle 1,

Grade 3 AEs were reported for 28.7% (47/164) of patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 16.8% 
(24/143) of patients in the control arm, while Grade 4 AEs were reported for 45.7% (75/164)of patients in

AEs of Special Interest 
Hepatotoxicity, including venoocclusive liver disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome 
(VOD/SOS) 
In the pivotal clinical study (N=164), VOD/SOS was reported in 22 (13%) patients including 5 (3%) patients 
during study therapy or in follow-up without an intervening HSCT. Among the 77 patients who proceeded to 
a subsequent HSCT (6 of whom received additional salvage therapy after treatment with BESPONSA before 
proceeding to HSCT), VOD/SOS was reported in 17 (22%) patients. Five of the 17 VOD/SOS events that 
occurred post-HSCT were fatal.  
VOD/SOS was reported up to 56 days after the last dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin without an intervening 
HSCT. The median time from HSCT to onset of VOD/SOS was 15 days (range: 3, 57 days). Of the 5 patients 
who experienced VOD/SOS during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin but without an intervening HSCT, 
2 patients had also received an HSCT before BESPONSA treatment.  
Among patients who proceeded to HSCT after BESPONSA treatment, VOD/SOS was reported in 5/11 (46%) 
patients who received an HSCT both prior to and after BESPONSA treatment and 12/66 (18%) patients who 
only received an HSCT after BESPONSA treatment. 
Regarding other risk factors, VOD/ SOS was reported in 6/11 (55%) patients who received a HSCT 
conditioning regimen containing 2 alkylating agents and 8/52 (15%) patients who received a HSCT 
conditioning regimen containing 1 alkylating agent, 7/17 (41%) patients who were ≥ 55 years old and 10/60 
(17%) patients who were < 55 years old, and 7/12 (58%) patients with a serum bilirubin ≥ ULN prior to 
HSCT and in 10/65 (15%) patients with a serum bilirubin < ULN prior to HSCT. 
In the pivotal study (N=164), hyperbilirubinaemia and increased transaminases were reported in 35 (21%) 
and 43 (26%) patients, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 hyperbilirubinaemia and increased transaminases were 
reported in 9 (6%) and 11 (7%) patients, respectively. The median time to onset of hyperbilirubinaemia and 
increased transaminases was 73 days and 29 days, respectively (SmPC, section 4.8).  
Infections 
In the pivotal study (N=164), infections, including serious infections, some of which were life threatening or 
fatal, were reported in 79 (48%) patients. The frequencies of specific infections were: sepsis and 
bacteraemia (16%), lower respiratory tract infection (12%), upper respiratory tract infection (12%), fungal 
infection (9%), viral infection (8%), gastrointestinal infection (4%), skin infection (4%), and bacterial 
infection (1%). Fatal infections, including pneumonia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis, septic shock, and 
pseudomonal sepsis, were reported in 8 (5%) patients (SmPC, section 4.8).

Bleeding /Haemorrhage 
In the pivotal clinical study (N=164), bleeding/haemorrhagic events, mostly mild in severity, were reported 
in 54/ (33%) patients. The frequencies of specific bleeding/haemorrhagic events were: epistaxis (15%), 
upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (5%), lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (4%), and central nervous 
system (CNS) haemorrhage (1%). Grade 3/4 bleeding/haemorrhagic events were reported in 8/164 (5%) 
patients. One Grade 5 bleeding/haemorrhagic event (intra abdominal haemorrhage) was reported (SmPC, 
section 4.8). 
Myelosuppression/cytopenias 
In the pivotal study (N=164), thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 83 (51%) and 81 (49%) 
patients, respectively. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 23 (14%) and 33 (20%) 
patients, respectively. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were reported in 46 (28%) and 45 (27%) 
patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, which may be life-threatening, was reported in 43 (26%) patients 
(SmPC, section 4.8). 
Infusion related reactions  
In the pivotal study (N=164), infusion related reactions were reported in 17 (10%) patients. All events were 
Grade ≤ 2 in severity. Infusion related reactions generally occurred in Cycle 1 and shortly after the end of 
the inotuzumab ozogamicin infusion and resolved spontaneously or with medical management (SmPC, 
section 4.8). 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)  
In the pivotal study (N=164), TLS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, was reported in 4/164 (2%) 
patients. Grade 3/4 TLS was reported in 3 (2%) patients. TLS occurred shortly after the end of the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin infusion and resolved with medical management (SmPC, section 4.8). 
QT interval prolongation 
In the pivotal study (N=164), increases in QT interval corrected for heart rate using the Fridericia formula 
(QTcF) ≥ 60 msec from baseline were measured in 4/162 (3%) patients. No patients had QTcF values > 500 
msec. Grade 2 QT prolongation was reported in 2/164 (1%) patients. No Grade ≥ 3 QT prolongation or 
events of Torsades de Pointes were reported (SmPC, section 4.8).

Increased amylase and lipase  
In the pivotal study (N=164), increases in amylase and lipase were reported in 8 (5%) and 15 (9%) patients, 
respectively. Increases in Grade ≥ 3 amylase and lipase were reported in 3 (2%) and 7 (4%) patients, 
respectively (SmPC, section 4.8).   
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies of BESPONSA in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL, 7/236 (3%) patients tested 
positive for anti-inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies. No patients tested positive for neutralising anti 
inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies. In patients who tested positive for anti inotuzumab ozogamicin 
antibodies, no effect on clearance of BESPONSA was detected based on population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The number of patients was too small to assess the impact of anti inotuzumab ozogamicin antibodies on 
efficacy and safety (SmPC, section 4.8).   
Neurotoxicity 
An updated review of neurotoxicity was provided (cut-off 8 March 2016). In Study B1931022, neurotoxicity 
AEs were reported in 17 (10.4%) and 10 (7%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and control arm. 
The median time to onset was 39 days for the patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin and 11.5 days for 
patients in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm. The only AE reported with frequency ≥2% in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with the control arm was peripheral neuropathy (6 [3.7%] vs 2 
[1.4%] patients). One patient in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (0.6%) and 2 patients in the investigator’s 
choice arm (1.4%) reported Grade ≥3 neurotoxicity AEs. No patient in either treatment arm had Grade 4 or 
5 neurotoxicity AEs. 
Nephrotoxicity 
In Study B1931022, nephrotoxicity AEs were reported in equal proportions of patients receiving inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and control (5%). The most frequently reported AE in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm was acute 
renal failure (4 patients). Increased creatinine was recorded with similar frequency in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (8.6%) and control arm (11.4 %). All were Grade 1 and 2 events.   
Interstitial lung disease 
One patient in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm in Study B1931022 was reported to have Grade 1 
bronchiolitis obliterans and pneumonitis 8 days prior to death due to disease progression. 
Pancreatitis 
In study B1931022, pancreatitis AEs were reported in 18/164(11%) patients treated with inotuzumab 
ozogamicin compared to 3(2.1%) patients receiving control therapy. AEs in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm 
were increased lipase (15 [9.1%], including 4 Grade 3 and 3 Grade 4 events), increased amylase (8 [4.9%], 
including 3 Grade 3 and no Grade 4 events), Grade 1 pancreatic pseudocyst and Grade 1 pancreatitis 
necrotising in the same patient (1 [0.6%]) and Grade 3 pancreatitis (1 [0.6%]). Grade 1 increased amylase

and Grade 2 pancreatitis were reported in 1 patient each in the control arm.  There were no permanent 
treatment discontinuations or Grade 5 pancreatitis AEs. 
Inflammatory GI events 
In study B1931022, inflammatory GI AEs were reported in 24 (14.6 %) patients receiving inotuzumab 
ozogamicin and 40 (28.0%) patients receiving control therapy. These included Grade 2 gastritis, Grade 3 
colitis (typhlitis) and Grade 5 ischaemic colitis in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and Grade 2 gastritis and 
Grade 3 colitis and enteritis in the control arm.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event 
In study b1931022 (updated analysis, 08 March 2016 data cutoff), the overall frequency of SAEs was higher 
for all cycles than Cycles ≤2 (51.2% vs 37.2%, respectively); 23 additional patients had SAEs beyond Cycle 
2 (23 of 87 [26.4%] patients who received >2 cycles). In general, the frequencies of individual SAEs were 
similar for all cycles and for Cycles ≤2. The only individual SAE with a >5% increase in frequency between 
Cycles ≤2 and all cycles was VOD (5.5% and 13.4%, respectively). The frequencies of SAEs were higher in 
the SOCs ‘Hepatobiliary Disorders’ and ‘Infections and Infestations’, for all cycles compared to Cycles ≤2 
(14.0% vs 6.1%, and 23.8% vs 17.7%, respectively); the most common SAEs in these SOCs were VOD and 
pneumonia, respectively.

Deaths 
In study B1931022 (updated analysis,data cut-off 08 March 2016), all –causality Grade 5 TEAEs were 
reported for 26/164 (15.9%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 16/143 (11.2%) of patients in 
the control arm, mostly grouped in the ‘Infections and infestations’ SOC (4.9% in both arms). The most 
frequently reported Grade 5 SAE was disease progression (4.9 vs. 3.5%).  
There were 9 deaths in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (n=164) within 30 days of Cycle 1 day 1 and 32 
deaths within 42 days after the last dose, mostly due to ALL and infection. In the control arm (n=143), the 
figures were 8 and 19, respectively, with the majority also due to ALL, followed by infection. 
Grade 5 TEAEs considered related to study drug were reported for 9 (5.5%) patients in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin arm; these were VOD/SOS (5 patients post follow-up HSCT), intestinal ischaemia/ septic shock 
(post Cycle 5, Day 8), acute respiratory distress (post Cycle 3, Day 15), pneumonia (post cycle 5, Day 1) and 
mult-organ failure (post Cycle 5 D8 and HSCT, with ongoing SOS). Grade 5 TEAEs considered treatment 
related were reported in 3 patients (2.1%) in the control arm; these were intracranial haemorrhage, multi-
organ failure and lung infection/ respiratory failure.  
In study B1931010, 9 patients (12.5%) had Grade 5 TEAEs, including 5 patients with disease progression. 
Two SAEs were considered treatment related - septic shock during inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy and VOD 
post follow-up HSCT.  
In IIR studies (as of 01 September 2015 data cutoff), Grade 5 SAEs were reported for 26/231 (11.3%) 
patients, most commonly VOD (n=5), neutropenia (n=4), pneumonia (n=3) and multi-organ failure and 
disease progression (n=2 each).   
In compassionate use studies (as of 01 September 2015 data cutoff), 16 from an approximate total of 79 
patients (~20.3%) had SAEs with fatal outcomes reported in the USA and Europe, most commonly disease 
progression and pneumonia. Grade 5 treatment-related SAEs were reported for 4 patients; graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD) of the GI tract and abnormal hepatic function; hepatocellular injury and cholestasis; 
hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic failure.

The applicant established processes to help ensure that all VOD/SOS events were captured in Study 
B19301022. Investigators had to complete a Severe Hepatotoxicity Form for all specified hepatotoxicity AEs 
(not just SAEs) until the EOT visit and for additional AEs of note (liver failure; liver transplantation; cirrhosis; 
new ascites; new oesophageal varices; new hepatic encephalopathy; suspected SOS, nodular regenerative 
hyperplasia, focal nodular hyperplasia or Budd-Chiari Syndrome) until 2 years from randomisation. These 
forms were reviewed by an independent external Hepatic Events Adjudication Board (HEAB) that provided 
advice to the e-DMC.  
Overall in study B1930122 (updated analysis, 8 March 2016 data cutoff), VOD was reported more frequently 
in the inotuzumab ozogamicin (22/164 [13.4%]) than control arm (1/143 [0.7%], post follow-up HSCT). 
Among all 164 patients treated, VOD/SOS was reported in 5/164 (3%) patients during study therapy or in 
follow-up without an intervening HSCT. Among the 77 patients who proceeded to a subsequent HSCT, 
VOD/SOS was reported in 17/77 (22.1%) patients. Of these 17 cases, there were 5 deaths due to VOD (all 
post-follow-up HSCT) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, with 2 of the fatal events occurring after a second 
or third unrelated donor HSCT, respectively.  The median time to onset of VOD after HSCT was 15 days 
(range 3-57). 
In the IIR studies (as of 1 September 2015 data cutoff), VOD (total) included 12 events; there were 3 VOD 
events reported in CU patients.

proceeded to HSCT, prior to intervening conditioning therapy and HSCT. 
b. Includes 1 patient with VOD that occurred at day 57 with no intervening HSCT 
c. Both patients died: One fatal VOD event in a Salvage 3 patient post 2 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin. One patient (Salvage 4 post 6 
cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin) with VOD ongoing at the time of death due to pneumonia.   
Study B1931022 (Updated Analyses, 8 March 2016) 
Conditioning regimen for HSCT: Use of dual alkylator conditioning regimens was significantly associated with 
post-HSCT VOD/SOS. VOD/SOS was reported in 8/52 (15.4 %) patients and 6/11 (54.5%) patients who 
received single- and dual-alkylator conditioning regimens, respectively. Fatal VOD/SOS was reported in 2/52 
(3.8%) patients and 2/11 (18.2%) patients who received single- and dual-alkylator conditioning regimens, 
respectively. VOD/SOS was reported in 4/5 (80%) patients who received busulfan in combination with 
thiotepa as the HSCT conditioning regimen.

Age: Age ≥55 was also significantly associated with a higher incidence of VOD/SOS.  Among patients who 
proceeded to HSCT in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, VOD/SOS was reported in 10/60 (16.7%) patients 
and 7/17 (41.2%) patients who were <55 years and ≥55 years, respectively, and 14/71 (19.7%) patients 
and 3/6 (50%) patients who were <65 years and ≥65 years, respectively.  
Other factors that may be associated with an increased risk: 
Prior HSCT: Two of the 5 patients who experienced VOD/SOS during treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin 
or in follow-up but without an intervening HSCT had undergone HSCT before inotuzumab ozogamicin 
treatment. Patients treated with more than 1 allogeneic HSCT are at increased risk. The median time from 
the first dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin to development of VOD was 30.0 days (range 14 – 238). One event 
resolved and 4 VOD events were ongoing at the time of death due to other causes (progressive leukaemia, 
pneumonia, neutropaenic sepsis, pseudomonal bacteraemia).  
Prior history of liver disease and/or hepatitis: VOD/SOS was reported in 10/57 (17.5%) patients without and 
7/20 (35%) patients with a prior history of liver disease who proceeded to HSCT.  
Pre-HSCT laboratory analysis: The rates of VOD/SOS in patients who proceeded directly to HSCT were: 
 
Platelet count <100 x 109/L vs. ≥100 x 109/L: 10/37 (27%) vs. 5/34 (14.7%) 
  ALT/AST > 1.5 x ULN vs. ≤ 1.5 x ULN: 2/12 (16.7%) vs. 13/59 (22%) 
  Serum total bilirubin ≥ULN vs. <ULN: 6/11 (54.5%) vs. 9/60 (15%) 
Use of ursodeoxycholic acid and defibrotide  
The study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of ursodeoxycholic acid and defibrotide. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid was used prophylactically to reduce the frequency and severity of hepatic toxicity in 
77 (47.0%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm; 15/ 17 patients with VOD/SOS post-HSCT received 
ursodeoxycholic acid prior to HSCT.  
Defibrotide was used to treat VOD/SOS in 13 (7.9%) patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm in study 
B1931022. Of the inotuzumab ozogamicin-treated patients with Grade 3/4 SOS, 3 who were treated with 
defibrotide recovered as opposed to none who were not treated with defibrotide.   
Study B1931022 Laboratory findings (Updated Analysis, 8 March 2016 data 
cutoff) 
Expected changes in haematological laboratory parameters were recorded with decreased leucocytes, 
neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets. Grade 3 haematology laboratory test abnormalities were more 
frequent in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and Grade 4 abnormalities in the control arm. 
Liver-related laboratory test abnormalities were very common but more frequently observed in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin than the control arm, including increased AST (73.5% vs 38.7%), ALT (49.7% vs 
47.1%), ALP (57.7% vs 52.9%), GGT (69.0% vs 66.9%) and bilirubin (36.2% vs 36.2%).  There were 3 
Grade 4 abnormalities in each treatment arm, involving increased AST, bilirubin and GGT.  
Pancreatic-related laboratory test abnormalities were more frequently observed with inotuzumab ozogamicin, 
including Grade 3 and 4 AEs: increased lipase (29.7% vs 18.6%, Grade 3: 10.1% vs 2.0%, Grade 4: 1.4%

vs 0%), increased amylase (13.4% vs 10.5%, Grade 3: 2.5% vs 0.9%); there were no Grade 4 
abnormalities. Hyperglycemia (mostly Grade 1 or 2) was observed in 80.7% of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
patients and 77.7% of control patients. Grade 3 and 4 elevations were reported in 12.4% and 0.6% of 
patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin and 6.5% and 0.7% of patients treated with control, 
respectively.  These were not fasting samples and concomitant corticosteroids could contribute.  
ECGs 
In Study B1931022, increases in QTcF of ≥ 60 msec from baseline were measured in 4/162 (3%) patients in 
the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 3/124 (2%) in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm. 
Increases in QTcF of > 500 msec were observed in none of the patients in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm 
and 1/124 (1%) patients in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm (see section 4.8). Mean (90% CI) 
maximum QTcF changes from baseline were 16.5 msec (14.3 18.7) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 
10.8 msec (8.0 13.6) in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm. Central tendency analysis of the 
QTcF interval changes from baseline showed that the highest upper bound of the 2 sided 90% CI for QTcF 
was 21.1 msec (observed at Cycle 4/Day 1/1 hour) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 21.2 msec 
(observed at Cycle 2/Day 1/1 hour) in the Investigator’s choice of chemotherapy arm (SmPC section 5.2).

Immunological events 
In Study B1931022 (updated analysis, 08 March 2016 data cutoff),, infusion-related reaction AEs (including 
only events that occurred from start of infusion to within 1 calendar day of end of infusion) were reported in 
53 (32.3 %)  patients receiving inotuzumab ozogamicin and 63 (44.1%)  patients receiving control therapy; 
the most frequent reaction was pyrexia (21 [12.8%]vs 36 [25.2%]patients, respectively). Patients treated 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin were usually pre-medicated with corticosteroid and/or acetaminophen and an 
antihistamine. Patients received subsequent infusions of inotuzumab ozogamicin without incident.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety concerns related to drug – drug interactions with inotuzumab ozogamicin have been identified.   
Discontinuation due to AES 
In study B1931022 (updated anaylsis, 08 March 2016 data cutoff),, AEs were associated with treatment 
discontinuation in 18.9% (31/164) patients (including TEAEs  associated with treatment discontinuation in 
18.3% (30/164) patients and 1 patient with non-treatment emergent AE associated with treatment 
discontinuation) in patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin, most commonly pneumonia (n= 5) and 
thrombocytopenia (n=3), increased AST, increased GGT hyperbilirubinemia, sepsis and VOD/SOS (n=2 
each). SAEs leading to permanent discontinuation were experienced by 11.0% of patients in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin arm versus 7.0% patients in the control arm, most commonly pneumonia (n=5 [3.0%]) 
VOD/SOS and sepsis (n=2 [1.2%] each) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and febrile neutropenia (n=3 
[2.1%]) in the control arm. 
Assessment report

Page 120/133 
 
  
  
 
 
In the updated analysis (March 2016), 43 patients (31 (18.9%) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 12 
(8.4%) patients in the control arm) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs. The median time to discontinuation 
due to AE was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.3, 6.8) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, and not estimable for the 
control arm. In the safety population, the stratified HR for the time to discontinuation was 0.679 (97.5% CI: 
0.291-1.586).   
Post marketing experience 
N/A. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety  
As expected in the relapsed/ refractory ALL population, in Study B1931022 (08 March 2016 data cutoff), 
most patients (99.4%) experienced AEs, with 87.8% patients experiencing AEs considered related to 
inotuzumab ozogamicin. The most common events (all causality and those considered treatment-related) 
were cytopenias, fatigue, pyrexia, abnormal liver function tests and abdominal events (nausea, diarrhoea, 
vomiting and constipation). Only 3.0% patients were dose reduced due to TEAEs; most patients (43.9%) 
were managed by dose interruption with only 18.3% requiring permanent treatment discontinuation.  
The most common (≥ 20%) adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia (51%), neutropenia  (49%), infection 
(48%), anaemia (36%), leukopenia (35%), fatigue (35%), haemorrhage (33%), pyrexia (32%), nausea 
(31%), headache (28%), febrile neutropenia (26%), transaminases increased (26%), abdominal pain (23%), 
gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (21%), and hyperbilirubinaemia (21%).  
In patients who received Besponsa, the most common (≥ 2%) serious adverse reactions were infection 
(23%), febrile neutropenia (11%), haemorrhage (5%), abdominal pain (3%), pyrexia (3%), VOD/SOS (2%), 
and fatigue (2%).SAEs were experienced by 48.2% patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin; 25.2% 
patients suffered SAEs that were considered to be treatment related. 
A total of 26 (15.9%) deaths occurred during treatment in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 16 (11.2%) 
in the control arm, mostly due to infection and disease progression.  
Hepatotoxicity was due to the cytotoxic agent (conjugated/ unconjugated) and was target-independent. 
Increased AST/ ALT and histopathological changes were seen in non-clinical studies in rats and monkeys, 
including microvascular liver injury in monkeys, considered to represent early venoocclusive liver disease. 
Severe, life-threatening and sometimes fatal VOD was seen in clinical studies with inotuzumab ozogamicin 
and with the related ADC gemtuzumab ozogamicin. 
VOD is contributed to early transplant related mortality and meant that the median gain in OS was only 1 
month. The creation by the Sponsor of the ‘Severe Hepatotoxicity Form’ and external ‘Hepatic Events 
Adjudication Board’ (HEAB) means that we can have reasonable confidence that the hepatotoxic adverse 
events have been adequately captured and assessed. Factors predisposing to an increased risk of SOS have 
been identified. These include the use of dual alkylating agents in the HSCT conditioning regimen and age 
≥55 years. Other factors may be influential, including a bilirubin ≥ ULN pre HSCT and HSCT prior to 
inotuzumab ozogamicin. Information on these risks is included in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8). 
No evaluation of risk can be undertaken in patients who have experienced prior confirmed severe or ongoing 
venoocclusive liver disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and in patients with serious ongoing hepatic 
disease (e.g., cirrhosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, active hepatitis), as these patients have not been

treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin. It can only be surmised that their risk of VOD is unacceptably high and 
that these populations should be contraindicated (SmPC section 4.3). Grade ≥3 and/or serious 
hepatotoxicity, including all VOD/SOS have been categorized as an identified risk (see Risk Management 
Plan).   
In Study B1931022, myelosuppression/ cytopenia was reported in 82.9% of patients with Grade ≥3 AEs 
were reported in 81.1% of patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin. Potential consequences of 
myelosuppression/cytopenia include infection and bleeding. Serious infections, some of which were life-
threatening or fatal, were frequently reported with inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy. 
Myelosuppression/cytopenia has been categorized as an identified risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
In addition to cytopenias and hepatobiliary abnormalities, the most common laboratory test abnormalities 
with inotuzumab ozogamicin were (lipase and amylase) and hyperglycaemia. These blood tests should be 
measured during treatment which is reflected in the SmPC (sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
In Study B1931022, infections were reported in 48.8%, including Grade 3 in 19.5%, Grade 4 in 4.3% and 
Grade 5 in 4.9% of patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin. Haemorrhage was seen in 33.5%, including 
Grade 3 in 3.7%, Grade 4 in 1.2% and Grade 5 in 1.2% of patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin.  
The incidence of alveolar macrophages was low in the preclinical studies (higher incidence in females only) 
and considered non-adverse. Still, they may be treatment-related given that the highest tissue-to-plasma 
ratios (although low themselves) were observed in the liver (0.6), blood (0.5), spleen (0.4), lung (0.3) and 
kidney (0.3). Interstitial lung disease has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Only 1 patient in study B1931022 was reported to have bronchiolitis obliterans and pneumonitis (Grade 1) 
prior to death due to disease progression.  However, a few more events were reported in the NHL studies - 
Grade 1 pneumonitis (n=2), Grade 2 lung infiltration (n=1) and Grade 4 alveolitis (n=1). This patient 
progressed to multi-organ failure and death despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and haemodynamic support.  
Autopsy lung findings revealed “diffuse toxic alveolitis”.  
Pulmonary events were reported with the related product gemtuzumab ozogamicin, possibly as sequelae of 
infusion reactions and patients with WBC ≥30000µ/L.   
There was 1 Grade 5 event of ischaemic colitis in the pooled ALL studies and none in the NHL studies. 
Patients with refractory leukaemia, particularly those receiving anti-leukaemic therapy, are susceptible to GI 
inflammation due to direct injury to the mucosal lining from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis as well as 
neutropenia.  Ischaemic colitis is more likely to occur in older patients, especially those with comorbidities 
such as ischaemic cardiac disease.  
Pancreatic-related AEs were reported in 9.4% % of pooled ALL patients (updated analysis including 212 
patients who received 1.8 mg/m2 inotuzumab ozogamicin in studies b1931022 [n=164] and b1931010 
[n=48]), including 4 Grade 4 events, mainly increased amylase and lipase. There were single clinical events 
of pancreatitis, acute pancreatitis and necrotizing pancreatitis. There were no Grade 5 pancreatic AEs or 
permanent treatment discontinuations. Pancreatitis has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
Based on nonclinical data, inotuzumab ozogamicin is clastogenic and, consistent with induction of DNA 
breaks, calicheamicin is genotoxic and clastogenic. In rats, preneoplastic lesions were observed in the liver 
after 4 weeks of dosing and neoplastic lesions were observed in the liver after 26 weeks of dosing. An altered 
hepatocellular focus was seen in 1 monkey. In ALL Study B1931010, a heavily pretreated Salvage >5 
Assessment report

patient, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after 3 cycles of inotuzumab ozogamicin 
treatment. Per Investigator, causal attribution to inotuzumab ozogamicin could not be excluded. Second 
primary malignancy has been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin was associated with toxicity in embryo-foetal nonclinical studies.  No pregnancies 
were reported in female patients or in the partners of male patients during the clinical ALL studies.  
Inotuzumab ozogamicin is genotoxic and can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity (post exposure during pregnancy and while breast feeding) has 
been categorized as a potential risk (see Risk Management Plan). 
A formal thorough QT study of inotuzumab ozogamicin has not been conducted but evaluation the QTcF 
interval was an exploratory endpoint in study B1931022. Increases in QTcF were observed and this is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (sections 4.4., 4.8, 5.2).  
Hispanic and Black patients have been underrepresented in clinical studies of inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
Therefore, it is not known whether the adverse event (AE) profile in those (and other) racial and/or ethnic 
groups is different from that seen in White and Asian patients. Use in Hispanic and Black patients has been 
classified as missing information. This has been adequately reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
Use in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and use in patients with severe renal impairment 
have been classified as missing information (see Risk Management Plan). 
In Study B1931022, out of 7 patients with positive ADAs, there were 2 patients with positive ADAs after 
treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin (without positive ADA response prior to treatment) and AEs thought 
attributable to immunogenic response: 1 patient, with positive ADAs at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1 and 
EOT, exhibited Grade 2 pyrexia on Days 1 to 4. 1 patient, with a positive ADA at EOT, exhibited Grade 1 
chills and pyrexia on Days 1 to 2 and anaemia (Grade 3) on Days 3-5. Chills pyrexia and anaemia were 
observed in at least 5% of patients in the study. 
Besponsa has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients may experience fatigue 
during treatment with Besponsa. Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines 
(SmPC, section 4.7). 
In  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  ALL,  the  maximum  single  and  multiple  doses  of 
inotuzumab ozogamicin were 0.8 mg/m2 and 1.8 mg/m2, respectively, per cycle, given as 3 divided doses on 
Days 1 (0.8 mg/m2), 8 (0.5 mg/m2), and 15 (0.5  mg/m2). Overdoses  may  result in  adverse reactions  that 
are  consistent  with  the  reactions  observed  at  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose.  In  the  event  of  an 
overdose,  the  infusion  should  be  temporarily  interrupted  and  patients  should  be  monitored  for  liver  and 
haematological  toxicities.  Re-initiation  of  Besponsa  at  the  correct  therapeutic  dose  should  be  considered 
when all toxicities have resolved (SmPC, section 4.9). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in pivotal phase III study B1931022 have been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of inotuzumab ozogamicin is considered acceptable for use in the treatment of adult 
patients with for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B cell precursor ALL. Many

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, BESPONSA (inotuzumab ozogamicin) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for by the Applicant is for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory B-cell precursor ALL.  Patients were screened at baseline for CD22 positivity on the blast cell 
surface (CD22 >0%) by local laboratory test and were Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) or positive 
(Ph+); the latter had to have been treated with at least one prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Modern multi-agent combination chemotherapy regimens in adults with ALL result in complete response rates 
of 80-90%.  However, most patients in complete remission will relapse, with just 30-50% having a disease-
free survival of 3 years or more. There is no single standard treatment for relapsed or refractory Ph- ALL. 
Common re-induction regimens include: 1) therapies based on a backbone of vincristine, corticosteroids, and 
anthracyclines; 2) cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and methotrexate and 
cytarabine (hyper-CVAD); 3) cytarabine based regimens such as high-dose cytarabine (HIDAC), fludarabine 
plus cytarabine plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (FLAG) +/- idarubicin, or mitoxantrone plus 
cytarabine (MXN/Ara-C) or 4) clofarabine or methotrexate based regimens. After early relapse, standard 
chemotherapy for relapsed/ refractory ALL shows complete remission rates of 31-44% in the first salvage 
therapy and 18-25% in the second salvage therapy. Obtaining a complete remission is a prerequisite for 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation, considered the only curative option. Only 5-30% of adults proceed to 
HSCT.

Blincyto (blinatumomab), a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 monoclonal antibody, received conditional approval in 
the EU in 2015 based on early data for treatment of the relapsed/ refractory Ph- B-cell ALL population.  
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasatinib and ponatinib) are the mainstay of treatment in the R/R Ph+ 
population. Dasatinib (Sprycel) was approved in 2006 for the treatment of adult patients with resistance or 
intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib (Iclusig) was approved in 2013 for the treatment of adult patients with 
Ph+ ALL who are resistant to/ intolerant of dasatinib.  
Despite these recent advances there remains a significant need for additional effective therapies with an 
acceptable safety profile that generate durable remissions and improve long-term survival for adult patients 
with relapsed/ refractory B cell ALL. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is an open-label, randomized phase 3 study comparing inotuzumab 
ozogamicin (n=164) versus a defined investigator’s choice (n=162) in adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In Study B1931022, inotuzumab ozogamicin induced haematological remission (CR/CRi) in 80.7% of treated 
patients. The improvement in CR/CRi rate compared to the defined Investigator’s choice chemotherapy was 
seen in all populations (ITT218, mITT218, PP218) and across the 3 pre-defined stratification subgroups 
(duration of first remission, line of salvage and age at randomization). Results of subgroup analysis of CR/CRi 
rate were consistent with the primary analysis, including a benefit in those who were Ph+ and who 
underwent prior HSCT. The higher CR/CRi rates for inotuzumab ozogamicin over control were seen in both 
the relapsed and refractory populations. CR/CRi rate appeared consistent in patients with ≥70% of 
leukaemic blasts CD22 positive at baseline by central laboratory analysis. 
MRD negativity was superior in the experimental arm (78%), compared to the control arm (28%).  
The median time from randomization to remission was 3 weeks for Besponsa and 4 weeks for the composite 
control. In the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (ITT 326 population), 70.8% and 25.8% of patients who achieved 
CR/CRi first achieved remission (CR or CRi) in Cycles 1 and 2, respectively. 
The median DOR was in favour of the experiment arm:  in the ITT218 population (08 March 2016 data 
cutoff), the median duration of remission in patients who achieved CR/CRi was longer in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin group (84 patients) than the chemotherapy control (32 patients [5.4 months (95% CI 4.2, 8.0 
months) vs. 3.5 months (95% CI 2.9, 6.6 months). The median DoR in all patients (ITT population , updated 
analysis, 08 March 2016, with patients without remission being given a duration of zero) was 3.7months (2.8 
to 4.3) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm and 0.0 months in the control arm, with a stratified HR (95%CI) of 
0.468 (0.363-0.603), 2-sided p<0.0001. 
An improvement in median PFS was evident [5.0 months (95% CI 3.7, 5.6) in the inotuzumab ozogamicin 
arm vs. 1.8 months (95% CI 1.5, 2.2) in the control arm, stratified HR 0.452 (97.5% CI 0.336, 0.609) 1-
sided p value <0.0001], as most patients progressed early on chemotherapy. In the standard definition of 
PFS, where switch of therapy was not considered an event, the median PFS was 5.6 months and 3.6 months 
in the inotuzumab ozogamicin and the control arm, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 127/133 
 
  
  
 
Median OS in the ITT population based on the stratified log rank test was increased by 1 month with 
inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to chemotherapy (7.7 months [95% CI 6.0, 9.2] vs. 6.7 months [95% CI 
4.9, 8.3]. This improvement was not statistically significant according to the pre-specified analysis but the 
planned testing strategy was over-conservative and the result could be considered positive while controlling 
the type I error at conventional levels. The primary OS result (HR = 0.77, 1 sided p=0.0203) was statistically 
significant at the accepted p-value threshold of 0.0229. The OS analyses in the mITT and PP populations 
were consistent with the results for the full ITT population. Overall survival showed an improvement in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm compared with the control arm with respect to all stratification factors per IVRS 
examined (duration of first remission [<12 months or ≥12 months], salvage status [Salvage 1 or 2] and age 
at randomization [<55 years or ≥55 years]). In general, patients with more favourable prognostic factors 
had a better survival outcome. Using Cox regression modeling, in the univariate analyses, baseline 
characteristics associated with lower risk of death in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm (2-sided p<0.05) were 
younger age (<55 years), Salvage 1, duration of first remission ≥12 months and baseline leukaemic blast 
CD22 positivity per central laboratory ≥90%. 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin allowed more patients to proceed directly to HSCT than control (71 vs. 18 patients) 
in the ITT (N=326) population.  
The updated OS (cut-off date 4 January 2017) was consistent with the primary OS analysis. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Certain questions cannot be answered with additional certainty due to the trial planning/ documentation or 
the small number of patients involved. It is not clear how the responses in the control arm compare with 
historical data as such comparisons were difficult in the context of the scientific evolution. A methodological 
weakness of the choice of the control arm that occurred after randomisation may potentially result in bias 
represent uncertainties, however in the view of the clear difference between the 2 arms it can be considered 
that this uncertainty has no impact on the demonstration of efficacy. 
Unfavourable effects 
Most patients treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin experienced adverse events. Adverse effects such as 
cytopenias, febrile neutropenia, infection, tumour lysis syndrome and haemorrhage did not occur with any 
greater frequency or severity than would be anticipated in a population with relapsed/ refractory ALL 
receiving a cytotoxic agent. Cytopenias were responsible for the greatest number of TEAEs, Grade ≥3 TEAEs 
and dose reductions due to AEs. Approximately half of patients (51.2%) treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin 
experienced SAEs and about 31% had ‘treatment related’ SAEs, particularly febrile neutropenia and 
venoocclusive disease. Development of anti-drug antibodies was uncommon and infusion-related reactions 
were mostly mild-moderate and managed with standard pre- medication. Most of the important AEs are due 
to the cytotoxic agent, calicheamicin, rather than the full ADC and are not related to binding to CD22 on the 
cell surface.  
Grade ≥3 hepatotoxicity and VOD were important events seen with higher frequency in the inotuzumab 
ozogamicin than the control arm.

3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of ALL patients in the pooled safety population is relatively small but adequate for a MAA in an 
orphan indication. Given the restricted population size, there is uncertainty regarding the significance of 
unfavourable events seen in the non-clinical setting, particularly neurotoxicity but also nephrotoxicity. Other 
events have been observed with low frequency clinically including interstitial lung disease and pancreatitis. 
All these safety concerns are being followed as important potential risks in the RMP.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Inotuzumab ozogamicin demonstrated strong proof of superiority over investigators’ choice of chemotherapy 
in the induction of haematological remission in adults with relapsed/ refractor B-cell ALL. This benefit was 
seen across all relevant subgroups and in the Ph+ subpopulation (around 20% of the full trial population). 
The high response rate was accompanied by deep molecular responses (high level of MRD negativity). 
Combined with a longer duration of remission and toxicity that was generally manageable, it allowed more 
patients to reach transplantation. Although there was a higher frequency of early deaths post HSCT in the 
inotuzumab ozogamicin arm, a late survival benefit was evident. Median overall survival was increased by 1 
month in the full trial population with inotuzumab ozogamicin compared to control chemotherapy.  
Overall, the nature of most of the reported AEs were expected in the relapsed/ refractory ALL population and 
were managed with dose interruption or discontinuation of inotuzumab ozogamicin. The main adverse event 
reported a higher frequency with inotuzumab ozogamicin was hepatotoxicity, including severe, life-
threatening, and sometimes fatal venoocclusive liver disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS). 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in the target population is considered clinically relevant and, despite 
the risk of VOD/SOS, the benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of BESPONSA as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-
positive B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) - is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Besponsa is not similar to Blincyto, Evoltra, Sprycel, Xaluprine 
Atriance and Iclusig within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Besponsa is favourable in the following indication: 
BESPONSA is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive 
B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive 
(Ph+) relapsed or refractory B cell precursor ALL should have failed treatment with at least 1 tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/289046/2017 
Page 131/133 
 
  
  
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product to be 
implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that inotuzumab ozogamicin is 
considered to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

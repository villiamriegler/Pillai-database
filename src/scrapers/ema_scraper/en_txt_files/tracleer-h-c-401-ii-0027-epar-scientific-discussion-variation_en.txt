SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1.1. 
Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  an  application  for  a  type  II  variation  to  change  the  indication  with  subsequent 
changes in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
In  support  of  the  variation  to  extend  the  indication  to  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  as  a 
whole indication, the applicant presents three new additional clinical studies:  
. In PAH associated with congenital heart disease with shunts (PAH-CHD)  
. Placebo-controlled trial AC-052-405 (Breathe-5) 
. Non comparative trial AC-052-403 : open label study 
. In PAH associated with HIV infection : 
. Non-comparative trial AC-052-362 (Breathe-4) 
1.2  Clinical aspects 
1.2.1. Introduction 
Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  is  a  rare  and  life-threatening  disease  characterized  by  medium-  and 
small-size pulmonary artery vasculopathy with cell proliferation and hypertrophy, in situ thrombosis 
and fibrosis. This process causes raised pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance 
against  which  the  right  ventricle  must  work.  Patients  with  PAH  commonly  develop  progressive 
cardiac hypertrophy and right ventricular dysfunction. The symptoms, which include dyspnoea, chest 
pain  and  fatigue,  become  progressively  debilitating,  and  most  patients  ultimately  succumb  to  right 
heart failure. The pathological and clinical presentations of PAH are essentially the same regardless of 
the underlying etiology. This was recognized by pulmonary hypertension experts in the 1990s, leading 
to the clinical classification of five groups of PAH established by the WHO. In accordance with this 
WHO classification system, PAH is a diagnostic term that describes a number of etiologies that share 
common  features  regarding  vascular  pathology,  pathophysiology,  clinical  picture  and  response  to 
therapeutic  intervention.  An  important  aspect  of  the  WHO  Clinical  classification  for  PAH  is  that 
patients  within  a  WHO  Group  are  likely  to  respond  similarly  to  a  given  therapeutic  intervention 
irrespective of the specific underlying etiology. A consensus algorithm for the management has been 
established by an international panel of European and US experts (see below).  
This WHO classification was revised during the Third World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension 
in  2003  including  5  groups  of  clinical  pulmonary  hypertension.    The  applicant  is  claiming  for  the 
extension of indication of Tracleer to the WHO group 1 of the revised Venice 2003 classification as 
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

The two pivotal registration studies (AC-052-351 and BREATHE-1) included mainly patients in 
WHO Functional Class III with primary PAH (72%), or PAH secondary to systemic sclerosis or other 
connective tissue diseases (21%), or to autoimmune diseases (7%). Consequently, the currently 
approved indication emphasizes these patient demographics via a statement that efficacy has been 
demonstrated in primary PAH (now known as idiopathic PAH or ‘IPAH’ and familial PAH) and PAH 
secondary to scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, PAH-SSc), or in other words, patients in WHO 
subgroups 1.1, 1.2 and partially subgroup1.3.

STUDY AC-052-405 (BREATHE-5) 
 a) Methodology  - study design 
This study AC-052-405 (BREATHE-5) was a multi-center, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel 
groups,  randomized,  16-week  trial  to  evaluate,  as  a  primary  safety  end  point,  the  effect  of  Tracleer 
(bosentan)  on  oxygen  saturation  in  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  related  to 
Eisenmenger physiology. 
The  effects  on  cardiac  hemodynamics  (via  cardiac  catheterization),  clinical  efficacy  on  exercise 
capacity (using 6-minute walk test and Borg dyspnea index) and WHO functional class, general safety 
and tolerability, were assessed as secondary objectives. 
To be eligible for this study, patients were to be with class III pulmonary arterial hypertension related 
to  Eisenmenger  physiology,  in  stable  conditions  for  at  least  3  months,  echocardiographically 
established  as  atrial  septal  defect  ≥  2  cm  effective  diameter  and/or  ventricular  septal  defect  ≥  1  cm 
effective diameter, pulmonary hypertension was to be confirmed by cardiac catheterization at baseline: 
mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 25 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 
<  15  mmHg  and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  (PVR)  >  3  mmHg/L/min.  Patients  had  to  have 
documented oxygen saturation ≤ 90% and > 70%, at rest with room air and a baseline walk test ≥ 150 
m and ≤ 450 m. 
Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  left  ventricular  dysfunction  (ejection  fraction  <  40%),  restrictive 
lung  disease  (TLC  <  70%  predicted),  obstructive  lung  disease  (FEV1  <  70%  predicted,  with 
FEV1/FVC < 60%), systolic blood pressure < 85 mmHg, coronary arterial disease. 
The 16-week treatment period consisted of an initial dosing phase (administration of bosentan 62.5 mg 
b.i.d. or matching placebo for 4 weeks), followed by a target dose treatment phase (bosentan 125 mg 
b.i.d.  or  matching  placebo  for  12  additional  weeks).  Patients  who  did  not  tolerate  the  125  mg  b.i.d. 
target dose could be down titrated to the starting dose (62.5 mg b.i.d.).  
Patients who were not withdrawn from this study were to be enrolled in the extension study (AC 052-
403) discussed later in this report. 
b) Baseline characteristics 
Fifty-four adult patients with Eisenmenger physiology secondary to congenital ventricular or atrial 
septal defects, or combination defects, were randomized 2:1 to bosentan (n = 37) or placebo (n = 17). 
Patients had symptomatic PAH, mainly in WHO Function Class III. Baseline characteristics, including 
mean arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), mean pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which, as 
expected was very high in this population, and 6 min walk test (6MWD), were comparable in both 
groups.

Antithrombotic  agents  and  high-ceiling  diuretics  were  the  most  frequently  used  treatments  in  both 
groups,  respectively  67.6%  and  27.0%  in  the  bosentan  group  and  64.7%  and  52.9%  in  the  placebo 
group.  Antiarrhythmics  Class  I  and  III  were  used  by  21.6%  and  17.6%  of  bosentan-  and  placebo 
treated patients, respectively. The treatment groups were well matched with regard to most treatment 
classes, but high-ceiling diuretics were less frequent in the bosentan than in the placebo group. 
The first primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline comparing bosentan target dose 125mg 
vs. placebo in SpO2 at rest at Week 16, assessed using a non-inferiority approach with a −5% delta. 
The second primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline vs placebo in pulmonary vascular 
resistance  indexed  (PVRi)  at  Week  16,  assessed  using  a  superiority  design.  Secondary  endpoints 
included exercise capacity, Borg dyspnoea index, WHO functional class and changes from baseline to 
Week  16  in  cardiopulmonary  haemodynamics  (mean  pulmonary  arterial  pressure,  mean  right  atrial 
pressure,  pulmonary  blood  flow/systemic  blood  flow  indexed,  PVRi/systemic  vascular  resistance 
indexed).  
c) Efficacy Results 
The  Week  16  oxygen  saturation  was  missing  for  2  patients  on  placebo  that  had  been  discontinued 
before  study  end  because  of  an  adverse  event.  These  patients  had  no  assessment  at  the  time  of 
withdrawal

SVRi  had  decreased  from  baseline  in  bosentan-treated  patients  (-376.7  ±  228.6  dyn·sec·cm-5)  and 
increased  in  placebo-treated  patients  (+446.8  ±  228.0  dyn·sec·cm-5),  resulting  in  a  mean  treatment 
effect of –823.4 ± 377.1 dyn·sec·cm-5 (p = 0.0340, Student’s t-test). 
After  week  16,  and  despite  a  significant  effect  on  systemic  vascular  resistance,  the  results  of  these 
studies  concluded  that  bosentan  did  not  relevantly  worsen  hypoxemia  and  improved  pulmonary 
vascular resistance.  
Non  inferiority  of  bosentan  as  compared  to  placebo  on  the  primary  safety  end  point  i.e.  oxygen 
saturation at rest at room, can be recognised since the 95% two-sided confidence interval of the mean 
difference  between  placebo  and  bosentan  did  not  include  the  predefined  threshold  difference  of  5 
units: CI95% [-0.7, 2.8] > -5 , based on Student’s distribution.  
At week 16, the mean oxygen saturation was not significantly different for patients on bosentan and 
for  those  on  placebo,  with  a  mean  treatment  effect  of  +1.0  ±  0.9%  and  a  mean  oxygen  saturation 
increased in both group (placebo :+0.5  ; bosentan : +1.5). At week 16, no bosentan-treated patient had 
a decrease from baseline to Week 16 in oxygen saturation ≥ 10%. At the Week-16 assessment, PVRi 
had decreased from baseline in bosentan-treated patients (-316.9 ± 138.3 dyn·sec·cm-5) and increased 
in  placebo-treated  patients  (+155.1  ±  134.0  dyn·sec·cm-5),  resulting  in  a  mean  treatment  effect  of  -
472.0 ± 221.9 dyn·sec·cm-5 (p = 0.0383, Student’s t-test 
This study was designed to monitor an early temporary oxygen desaturation that may occur during the 
first  one  or  two  weeks  of  bosentan  treatment,  and  with  dosage  up  titration.  Assessments  of  oxygen 
saturation were to be performed at W1, 4, 5, 8, 12. The results and analysis on oxygen saturation at 
these in- between dates and the analysis of the evolution on the oxygen saturation since the initiation 
of  the  treatment  were  requested  during  the  assessment  through  a  Request  for  Supplementary 
Information addressed to the MAH. 
The MAH has provided exploratory analysis on SpO2 at weeks 1, 4, 5, 8 and 12, showing no clinically 
relevant  differences  between  placebo  and  bosentan.  No  substitution  rules  were  applied  in  these 
analyses. Weeks 1 and 5 are of especial interest since these immediately follow initial dosing and up-
titration, respectively. Each exploratory analysis carried out at each scheduled timepoint showed that 
the lower limit of the 95% two-sided CL of the difference in observed change from baseline remained 
greater than –5, meeting the predefined non-inferiority hypothesis for the primary endpoint analysis. 
Maximum decreases from baseline in both groups were similar. No decreases in SpO2 were associated 
with adverse events or drug discontinuation.   
It is noticed that the magnitude of the maximum decrease observed in SpO2  at weeks 1, 4, 5, 8 and 12 
(W1= -6.0; W4 = - 7.0; W5 = - 6.0; W8 =  - 7.0; W12=- 5.0 ) were greater than at Week 16 =: -2. The 
maximal  observed  value  in  decrease  of  SpO2  was  similar  in  the  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  at  all 
time points except at W8 were the maximum decrease was – 7 in the bosentan group and – 4 in the 
placebo group. Nevertheless, at W8, the mean change from baseline remained positive and higher than 
placebo in the bosentan group.  
In conclusion the CHMP considered that the mean change from baseline in  SpO2 was positive at all 
time  points  in  the  bosentan  group.  There  is  no  signal  of  a  specific  risk  of  worsening  of  the  shunt 
related to the use of bosentan  especially at initiation of treatment (W1) and up titration (W5).  
At the Week-16 assessment, the Borg dyspnea index had decreased from baseline for bosentan-treated 
patients  (-0.6  ±  0.3)  and  increased  for  placebo-treated  patients  (+0.1  ±  0.6),  resulting  in  a  mean 
treatment effect of –0.7 ± 0.6 (p = 0.2481, Student’s t-test). 
At baseline, all bosentan- and placebo-treated patients were in Class III. At the Week-16 endpoint, 13 
bosentan-treated patients (35.1%) and 2 placebo-treated patients (12.5%) had improved to Class II; 1 
bosentan-treated patient (2.7%) and 1 placebo-treated patient (6.3%) had deteriorated to Class IV; all 
other patients remained in class III.

A  beneficial  effect  of  bosentan  can  be  recognised  at  week  16  on  exercise  capacity  and  WHO 
functional class in this study. At the Week-16 assessment, the 6-minute walk distance had increased 
from baseline for the bosentan-treated patients (+43.4 ± 8.1 m ; from 331.9 meters at baseline to 375.3 
meters at week 16) resulting in a mean treatment effect as compared to placebo of +53.1 ± 19.2 m ; 
CI95% : [+14.5, + 91.7] (p = 0.0079, Student’s t-test). 
These results are in the same extent as those observed in the initial other studies performed in primary 
pulmonary arterial hypertension and associated to sclerodermia (AC6052-351, BREATHE-1).  
All enrolled patients had either a predominantly right to left bidirectional shunt or an exclusively right 
to left shunt, as well as hypoxemia and clinically significant cyanosis. Patients were defined as having 
a bidirectional shunt if they presented any level of residual left to right blood flow through the defect, 
identified during Doppler echocardiography, primarily during the diastole. This residual diastolic left 
to right flow was negligible and did not influence the severity of systemic oxygen saturation (SpO2), 
which was assessed independent of echocardiographic shunt. No patient had a net left to right shunt.  
Hence, no clinically meaningful differences were expected between these subgroups. 
As  requested  by  the  CHMP,  the  applicant  has  conducted  a  sensitivity  analysis  first  looking  at 
differences in treatment effects between the subgroup of patients with bidirectional shunts and those 
with right to left shunt. In addition to analysis of baseline demographics by shunt, the treatment effects 
analyzed  were  change  from  baseline  to  Week  16  in  SpO2  (for  non-inferiority),  pulmonary  vascular 
resistance  indexed  (PVRi)  and  six-minute  walk  distance  (6MWD)  (for  superiority)  (see  tables  on 
following  pages).  The  adjusted  treatment  effect  on  SpO2,  PVRi  and  6MWD  with  its  two-sided  95% 
confidence limits was also evaluated using the general linear model with treatment and shunt direction 
as fixed effects.  
Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  subgroups  were  similar.  Overall,  the  results  of  the 
subgroup  analyses  on  SpO2,  PVRi  and  6MWD  suggest  that  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful 
differences in the evaluated efficacy or safety parameters between the echocardiography-defined shunt 
direction subgroups.  
 The magnitude of reduction of PVRi was greater in the bidirectional group; the treatment effect was 
−451.73 (dyn*sec*cm-5)  [CI: -949.83, 46.38] when adjusted with shunt direction as a covariate. 
The applicant was asked to compare the results for the right-to-left shunt patients (n=6) in BREATHE-
5 with the results of the open label part AC-095-405 
Six  bosentan  treated  patients  were  included  in  the  right  to  left  shunt  echocardiography  subgroup  of 
placebo-controlled,  randomized,  double-blind  international  study  AC-052-405,  whereas  11  patients 
were included in the open, uncontrolled Canadian pilot study AC-052-403. 
SpO2 was measured with finger pulse oximetry in both studies. In study AC-052-403, measurements 
were  made  at  rest  and  following  exercise  (6MWD),  whereas  only  at  rest  measurements  were 
conducted  in  study  AC-052-405.  A  comparison  between  SpO2  at  rest  at  baseline  and  week  16 
identifies very similar trends between the two studies.

difference is again difficult to interpret due to the small sample size.

The  applicant  provides  the  sub-groups  by  shunt  analysis  of  the  treatment  effect  on  change  from 
baseline to week 16 in SpO2 (at rest in room air), pulmonary vascular resistance indexed (PVRi) and 6 
minute walked distance (6MWD).  
At week 16, the treatment effect on SpO2 was in favour of bosentan in the subgroup of patients with 
bidirectional shunt: mean treatment effect as compared to placebo was : + 3.3 ; [95% CL of mean : + 
0.8 ; + 5.9 ]. The mean change from baseline in SpO2 as measured at W16 was + 1.6 (Min: - 3.0; Max 
:+9.0) in the bosentan group (placebo : - 1.7 ; Min: - 9.0; Max : + 5.0).  
In the subgroup of patients with a shunt direction exclusively right to left, although the lower limit of 
the  95%  CL  of  the  difference  in  observed  change  from  baseline  to  week  16  SpO2  remained  greater 
than  –  5  (which  was  the  limit  set  to  test  non  inferiority  primary  hypothesis),  the  mean  value  of  the 
treatment effect as compared to placebo was in favour of the placebo : - 1.3 ; [95% CL of mean : - 4.0 
; + 1.4 ].  However, in this subgroup of patients with an exclusively right to left shunt direction, the 
maximum  decrease  in  SpO2  observed  at  week  16  in  the  bosentan  group  was  minor  :  –  2.0    (similar 
value  in  the  placebo  group  :  -  2.0).  In  this  subgroup,  the  average  change  from  baseline  remained 
positive in patients treated with bosentan : + 0.6 .  
Thus,  the  controlled  study  AC-052-405  (BREATH-5)  provides  sufficiently  reliable  data  allowing  to 
conclude that there is no meaningful signal of worsening of the shunt related to the vasodilatory effect 
of bosentan when it is used in patients with intracardiac shunt and Eisenmenger’s syndrome.  
d) Discussion 
The  findings  from  this  study  show  that  the  effects  of  bosentan  on  exercise  capacity  are  of  similar 
magnitude  as  those  observed  in  patients  with  idiopathic/familial  PAH  and  PAH  associated  with 
systemic sclerosis. The MAH regards the patients studied in BREATH-5 as belonging to WHO Group 
1.3  “pulmonary  hypertension  associated  with  congenital  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts”,  and  the 
Sponsor has with this study covered an additional group of patients with PAH.  
Patients were selected with atrial and/or ventricular septal defect associated with a right to left or bi-
directional shunt. To maintain homogeneity in the compared group, Eisenmenger related to other type 
of shunts or associated to extracardiac abnormalities were not included. It can be recognised with the 
applicant that this selection of patients represents the majority of defects leading to the Eisenmenger 
physiology, and would permit for generalization of the results of the study to the main population of 
patients with PAH related to Eisenmenger physiology. 
However, the two groups were well matched at baseline except for the direction of the shunt. Indeed, 
only 6/37= 16.2% patients in the bosentan group showed a right to left shunt direction (that in general 
reflect a more severe Eisenmenger physiology) while the shunt was bidirectional in 83.8% patients in 
this group. The proportion of patients with right to left shunt was higher in the placebo group 10 /17= 
58.8%). A right-to-left shunt is a sign of more severe pulmonary hypertension and therefore the MAH 
was asked to discuss if and how the results might be affected by this difference between the groups. 
Regarding  efficacy  parameters  assessed  in  the  placebo  controlled  study  AC-052-405  (BREATH-5), 
the mean effect of bosentan on PVRi as compared to placebo was lower in the subgroup of patients 
with exclusively right to left shunt (Mean treatment effect as compared to placebo =  -94; 95%CL : – 
947.1, 758.9 ; p= 0.95) than in the bidirectional shunt group (Mean treatment  effect as compared to 
placebo = – 688.0 ; 95% CL : - 1330.0 ; -45.7; p=0.04] , but the 6MW distance remains in favour of 
bosentan in both subgroups by shunt. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, in summary, although the compared treatment groups were imbalanced in the placebo controlled 
AC-052-405  with  regards  to  the  direction  of  the  shunt  at  baseline,  as  identified  by  Doppler 
echocardiography,  it  can  be  accepted  to  recognise  that  this  study  provide  reliable  data  that  allow  to 
conclude that a benefit of bosentan has been demonstrated in patients with Eisenmenger. There is no 
specific signal regarding a potential worsening of the existing intracardiac shunt relating to a systemic 
vasodilatory effect when using bosentan in Eisenmenger patients with grade III functional status. 
In conclusion, the BREATHE-5 study provides evidence that bosentan does not cause a deterioration 
in the SpO2 in patients suffering from  PAH and Eisenmenger’s syndrome. The results regarding the 
pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  the  6  min  walking  test  improved  significantly,  especially  the 
difference in 6 min walk test of about 53 m is considered clinically relevant. 
E) Safety results  
36/37 patients (97.3%) had received at least 12 weeks bosentan treatment and 30 received at least 16 
weeks of bosentan treatment (81.1%). 
The total number of adverse events, excluding unrelated ones, was 22 in the bosentan group (n = 37) 
and 5 in the placebo group (n = 17).  
Adverse events that occurred in a greater proportion of patients on bosentan than on placebo included 
peripheral  oedema  (18.9%  vs.  5.9%),  headache  (13.5%  vs.  11.8%),  palpitations  (10.8%  vs.  0%), 
dizziness (8.1% vs. 5.9%) and chest pain (8.1% vs. 0%). Few adverse events were of severe intensity 
(8.1% in the bosentan group vs 17.6% in the placebo group). A similar proportion of patients in 
the  bosentan  and  placebo  groups  experienced  an  SAE  during  the  study  (13.5%  vs.  17.6%, 
respectively).  
Bosentan-treated patients had a decrease in mean systolic and diastolic artery pressure (-5.2 and -4.5 
mmHg,  respectively)  compared  with  placebo  (+0.7  and  -  2.3  mmHg,  respectively);  one  case  of 
hypotension was reported in the placebo group, and one case of vasovagal crisis was reported in the 
bosentan group. Only small changes from baseline were measured on ECG, and no clinically relevant 
differences were observed between treatment groups. 
Two  bosentan-treated  patients  (5.4%)  had  an  increase  in  liver  aminotransferases  over  3  x  ULN.  For 
one patient, the increase was over 5 x ULN and led to discontinuation; for the other, the increase was 
due to biliary colic with transient liver enzyme elevation (>8xULN) which resolved without sequelae. 
No patient had a marked decrease in hemoglobin concentration. 
During  the  study,  4  patients,  2  on  bosentan  and  2  on  placebo,  were  prematurely  discontinued  from 
study treatment because of an adverse event. Adverse events leading to discontinuation in the bosentan 
group were angina pectoris and abnormal liver function tests. 
No patient died during the study. One bosentan-treated patient died from right heart failure following 
non-protocol-related  closure  of  the  shunt-related  ASD  with  a  device;  death  occurred  60  days  after 
discontinuation of bosentan.  
In conclusion, the CHMP noticed that no new safety concerns were raised from this study regarding 
the safety profile of bosentan. 
1.2.3  Study  AC-052-403:  Open  label  Study  to  Investigate  the  Safety  of  Tracleer  (bosentan)  in 
Adult Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Related to Eisenmenger  
a) Methodology- study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of 16 weeks oral bosentan in adult patients with 
PAH related to Eisenmenger physiology. 
This  study  was  designed  to  primarily  assess  the  safety  of  bosentan  in  patients  with  PAH  related  to 
Eisenmenger, particularly with regards to oxygen saturation, laboratory tests, and tolerability.  
Change  at  week  16  from  baseline  on  exercise  capacity  (as  assessed  by  6-minute  walk  test,  Borg 
index),  WHO  functional  class,  12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  doppler-echocardiography 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measurements  and  quality-of  life  questionnaire  (using  the  Medical  Outcomes  Study  36-item  Short-
form Health Survey [SF-36]) were also assessed.  
After screening, eligible patients were enrolled and treated (initial dose of 62.5 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks 
followed  by  the  target  dose  of  125  mg  b.i.d.)  for  a  minimum  of  12  weeks.  Patients  progressed  to 
Period  2  (variable  duration)  without  interruption,  and  end-of-study  visits  were  scheduled  for  all 
patients when the last enrolled patient completed Period 1.  
Patients who continued their participation until the end of the study were eligible to continue treatment 
in a long-term extension study (AC-052-408). 
A total of 11 patients with WHO functional class III or IV PAH related to Eisenmenger  physiology 
(right-to-left  or  bi-directional  shunt  confirmed  by  echocardiography),  documented  oxygen saturation 
<90% (at rest, room air) and >70% (at rest, with or without oxygen), with a 6 min walk distance of 
150 to 450 were enrolled in the study. One patient withdrew from the study at the end of Period 1 and 
one patient was withdrawn prematurely due to an adverse event during Period 2. 
Patients were predominantly female (63.6%) and Caucasian (90.9%), with one black patient. Median 
age was 31 years (range of 19 to 55 years), median weight was 64 kg, and median height was 157 cm. 
The nine remaining patients completed the study and entered the following open-label extension study 
(AC-052-408). 
Further to the RSI adopted by the CHMP, the applicant committed to provide as a follow up measure 
the results of the open label study AC-052-408 soon after the study has completed.  
b) Efficacy Results 
All 11 patients received bosentan 62.5 mg b.i.d. for the first 4 weeks followed by bosentan 125 mg 
b.i.d. for the remainder of the study. All treated for at least 16 weeks and up to 48 weeks. The change 
in mean oxygen saturation from baseline to Week 16 at rest was 1.3% (95% CI −1.3; 3.8) (p = 0.292; 
t-test) and 1.3% after the 6MWT (−7.2; 9.8) (p = 0.746; t-test). There was a mean 25.5-meter increase 
in walk distance, a decrease in mean dyspnoea index, and a WHO functional class improvement from 
III to II in 45% of patients, with none deteriorating. No patient had an increase in PAH medication. 
A  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation  was  observed  in  some  patients,  particularly  following  exercise. 
Maximal observed decrease after 16 weeks (from baseline) was –11%, at end of treatment: – 17%. The 
applicant  was  asked  to  further  analyze  these  situations  and  discuss  on  the  unfavorable  results  on 
oxygen saturation that were observed after exercise tests.  
It  is  also  important  to  consider  the  method  of  assessing  systemic  oxygen  saturation  after  exercise 
testing.  Post-exercise  oxygen  saturation  levels  obtained  in  this  study  were  a  one-point  measurement 
via finger pulse oximetry taken immediately after the exercise session. Typically, oxygen saturation is 
at its lowest point right after exercise and then increases to the patient’s habitual level over the next 
several minutes. Post-exercise oxygen saturation is highly variable in this patient population since it is 
affected  by  not  only  the  patient's  disease  status,  but  by  the  intensity  of  the  exercise  itself.  This  can 
partially explain the inter-patient variability observed in post-exercise oxygen saturation between the 
baseline values and the week 16 or end of treatment values.  
The levels of oxygen saturation observed in this study most likely reflect the minimum value and are 
likely  to  be  more  variable  than  measuring  mean  oxygen  saturation  over  a  specified  time  frame  of 
several minutes. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  ensure  that  these  decreases  (–11%  and  –17%)  were  not  reflective  of  an  increase  in  disease 
symptoms  or  a  reaction  to  the  study  medication,  a  further  review  of  these  data  confirmed  that  the 
decreases  were  not  associated  with  any  adverse  events  and  were  observed  in  conjunction  with  an 
improvement  of  symptoms  as  assessed  by  the  WHO  Functional  Class  and  an  improved  exercise 
capacity  as  assessed  by  the  6-Minute  Walk  Test  (6MWT).    Although  SpO2  decreased  -11%  for  two 
patients  from  baseline  to  Week  16,  their  6MWT  increased  by  +39  m  and  +78  m.    At  end  of  study 
assessments beyond Week 16, these two patients also had improved 6MWT, +28m and +48m.  The 
patient who experienced an SpO2 decrease of -17%, the maximum decrease observed, at end of study 
had an improvement in 6MWT of +33m. 
Depending  on  the  specific  health  component  tested,  between  27%  and  64%  of  patients  reported  an 
improved quality of life, with eight patients showing improvement in at least one component.  
Improvement was also observed in mean health transition item (-0.6, 95% CL of -1.6 and 0.4), with 
five patients (45.5%) reporting an improvement in their quality of life, and one patient (9.1%, Patient 
2/201) reporting a worsening. In this analysis, four other patients (36.4%) remained the same, and one 
patient had no assessment. 
A  number  of  reports  of  uncontrolled,  published  studies  are  available.  They  all  describe  efficacy 
findings in line with those made in the well-controlled trial BREATHE-5. 
c) Safety results 
The  mean  treatment  duration  during  this  study  was  35.8  weeks  with  a  range  of  17.4  to  48.4  weeks. 
Patients were treated for variable durations during Period 2. 
One  patient  (Patient  1/101)  withdrew  after  17.4  weeks  of  treatment,  and  all  other  patients  (90.9%) 
received at least 28 weeks of study treatment. 
Two  patients  (18.2%)  were  prematurely  discontinued  from  the  study  (Table  3).  Patient  1/101  had 
Down’s syndrome, and withdrew consent after 122 days (17.4 weeks) of treatment because it was too 
inconvenient  to  continue  with  study  visits.  Patient  2/201  was  withdrawn  during  Period  2  (Day  197) 
due to a worsening condition (leg edema). 
No deaths occurred during or up to 28 days after the end of study treatment. 
Two patients (18.2%) experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) during study treatment. One patient 
experienced severe hypoglycemia, which was resolved with intravenous glucose administration. One 
patient  experienced  moderate 
in  permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment. No additional SAEs were reported up to 28 days after the end of 
study treatment. 
leg  edema  on  two  occasions,  which  resulted 
Headache  (5  patients)  was  the  most  frequently  reported  event,  followed  by  leg  edema  (3  patients), 
abdominal pain, dizziness, and flushing (2 patients each).  
Events  considered  to  be  related  to  study  treatment  included  headache,  flushing,  leg  edema,  and 
abnormal hair growth (increase). Events were generally mild or moderate in intensity; only one severe 
event was reported (hypoglycemia). 
A  1.0-g/dL  mean  decrease  in  hemoglobin  concentration  was  observed  consistent  with  that  observed 
with bosentan therapy in other studies.  
No marked increases in ALT or AST were observed in this study. A marked increase in bilirubin was 
observed (Patient 1/103) followed a high bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase at baseline, but ALT and 
AST were < 2 × the ULN at all times. 
No clinically relevant changes from baseline in vital signs or body weight were observed at the end of 
study  treatment.  A  small  mean  decrease  in  systolic  blood  pressure  (BP)  (-4.5  ±  13.0  mmHg;  ± 
standard deviation) was observed with no change in diastolic blood pressure (0.0 ± 10.2 mmHg). In 
many  patients,  blood  pressure  decreased  following  the  first  dose  of  study  medication  and  tended  to 
return  towards  baseline  with  continued  bosentan  treatment.  Hypotension  was  not  reported  for  any 
patient. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean changes in oxygen saturation at rest from baseline to Week 16 were not significant. 
A  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation  was  observed  in  some  patients,  particularly  following  exercise. 
Maximal  observed  decrease  after  16  weeks  (from  baseline)  was  –11%,  at  end of  treatment:      - 17% 
(table 36,37 of study report). 
Since  there  was  no  control  group,  conclusions  are  difficult  to  draw  from  this  study  regarding  the 
claimed  indication  of  PAH  associated  to  cardiac  shunt.  The  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation  in  some 
patients when measured after exercise is difficult to interpret without any control group. No new safety 
concern has emerged from this study. 
I.3.2.  PAH ASSOCIATED WITH HIV INFECTION  
Study AC-052-362: Open- label, non comparative study assessing safety and efficacy of bosentan 
in pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV infection - BREATHE 4  
A)  Methodology – Study design 
This was a multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study assessing safety and efficacy of bosentan 
in pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV infection. 
Patients characteristics were patients with PAH of World Health Organization (WHO) functional class 
III to IV associated with HIV infection despite optimal therapy for at least 1 month prior to screening, 
and a Baseline 6-min walk distance of < 450 m. Patients were to be on stable antiviral therapy for >3 
months  prior  to  screening,  and  CD4  count  >  100  cells/mm3  (changed  from  >200  cells/mm3  with 
amendment1) 
Portal hypertension, cirrhosis, moderate to severe liver impairment, or liver enzymes greater than three 
times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were considered as exclusion criteria. 
The  study  was  primarily  a  safety  study,  assessing  liver  function  test  and  efficacy  on  antiretroviral 
therapy  (as  evaluated  by  CD4  cell  count  and  plasma  HIV-1  RNA),  and  trough  plasma  levels  of 
protease inhibitors and NNRTIs among several endpoints. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy  endpoints  such  as  Change  from  baseline  to  Week  16  in  6  -minute  walk  distance,  Borg 
dyspnea  index,  WHO  functional  class,  Hemodynamic  variables  (right  heart  catheterization), 
Echocardiographic  variables,  Quality  of  life  assessments  (Medical  Outcomes  Study  SF-36  health 
questionnaire and Euro Quality of Life- 5D questionnaire), incidence of clinical worsening at the end 
of  16  weeks  of  treatment,  increase  in  therapy  for  PAH  during  16  weeks  of  treatment  were  used  to 
fulfill the secondary objective of the study  
Three  Protocol  amendments  were  made  during  the  study,  one  of  them  to  reduce  the  number  of 
enrolled  patients  from  30  to  18.  This  is  particularly  unfortunate  as  regards  the  reliability  of  the 
efficacy/safety data to be derived from this study.  
All  patients  completed  the  16-week  treatment  period.  As  regards  the  populations  analyzed,  the  all-
treated  (all  patients  who  receive  at  least  one  dose  of  bosentan)  and  safety  populations  (at  least  one 
assessment of safety) were identical. 
b) Baseline characteristics  
Overall, the patient population was male with a median age of 36.5 y (only one patient >60y). 
The median CD4 cell count was of 333/mm3 and 6 patients had viral load >400 copies/ml (including 2 
patients with more than 4 log copies/ml and 1 patient with more than 5 log copies/ml), the remainder 
having  an  undetectable  viral  load  (LOQ  400  copies/ml).  At  screening,  all  but  one  patient  was  on 
concomitant  HAART.  All  15  patients  were  administered  a  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitor 
(primarily lamivudine), and nine were also receiving a protease inhibitor (primarily ritonavir). 
At baseline, all patients were in WHO PAH Class III except one patient who was in Class IV.  The 
Mean 6-minute walked distance at baseline was 332.6 meters (range 150- 426 meters).  
The mean time since diagnosis of PAH was 1.7 years, and that of HIV was 8.8 years. For four (25%) 
patients,  the  time  since  diagnosis  of  HIV  had  been  more  than  15  years.  50%  of  patients  were  CDC 
stage C.  
Eight  patients  had  at  least  one  positive  indicator  of  hepatitis  B,  and  three  patients  had  a  positive 
indicator of hepatitis C.  
c) Efficacy results 
In  the  BREATHE-4  study  the  mean  improvement  in  6-minute  walk  distance  at  16  weeks  was  
+91 m ± 60m from 333 ± 79 m at baseline to 424 ± 57 m at week 16 (p < 0.001) (see table 6). This 
compares well with +44m (95%CI 21.4, 67; p = 0.0002) at 16 weeks in the pivotal study BREATHE-1 
(n = 213) and +76m (95%CI 12.5, 139.2; p = 0.02) in the pivotal study AC-052-351 (n = 33).  
After 16 weeks of treatment, patient-rated dyspnoea immediately following the walk test decreased by 
a mean of 1.9 on the Borg index compared with baseline values (p = 0.013).

Only one patient met the criteria for clinical worsening (i.e., death, hospitalization due to PAH, use of 
epoprostenol, lung transplantation, or septostomy). Patient 3/41 was hospitalized on Day 46 for fluid 
retention  and  right-sided  heart  failure  related  to  PAH.  There  was  no  death,  epoprostenol  use,  lung 
transplantation, or septostomy during the study. 
Furthermore,  the  improvements  seen  in  WHO  functional  class  in  the  BREATHE-4  study  were  also 
interesting according to the MAH. At baseline, 15 of the 16 patients were in functional class III, and 
one  patient  was  in  class  IV  (Table 7).  After  only  4 weeks  of  treatment,  9  (56.3%)  patients  showed 
improvement in functional class, including the class-IV patient. By Week 16, 14 (87.5%) patients had 
improved as regards functional class, including three patients who improved from class III at baseline 
to class I. None of the patients deteriorated in functional class.

The  above  clinical  endpoints  are  supported  by  and  consistent  with  the  objective  haemodynamic 
parameters  also  studied.  The  haemodynamic  findings  in  the  BREATHE-4  study  provide  substantial 
reassurance on the consistency of efficacy findings (see table 5). All patients improved as compared 
with  baseline;  after  16  weeks  of  bosentan  treatment,  patients  achieved  a  mean  increase  in  cardiac 
index and mean decreases in mean PAP and PVR compared with baseline values. Exploratory testing 
found these improvements to be highly significant in both parametric and non-parametric analyses.

D) Discussion 
The  CHMP  considered  that  only  exploratory  data  are  expected  to  be  driven  from  this  small  study 
performed  in  16  HIV  infected  patients  with  no  statistical  hypotheses  tested  and  whose  primary 
objective pertains to safety. 
The study in patients with HIV was conducted without a control group. Since placebo effects tend to 
differ remarkably between different studies in patients with pulmonary hypertension the efficacy data 
cannot be regarded as conclusive. Considering that the overall study population was only 16 patients, 
that safety in patients receiving multiple drug is a prominent issue of concern, and that there are major 
uncertainties regarding possible interactions especially with antiretroviral drugs, an indication in this 
group  of  patients  cannot  be  granted  based  on  the  submitted  data  only.    The  applicant  therefore  was 
requested to provide additional information to the CHMP. 
According  to  the  Applicant,  the  6-minute  walk  distance  (6MWD)  progressively  and  consistently 
worsens over time in placebo-treated PAH patients, at least in patients in WHO functional class III and 
worse,  where  the  clinical  condition  progressively  and  often  rapidly  deteriorates.  This  was 
demonstrated  in  the  two  pivotal  registration  studies  submitted  in  support  of  the  original  Tracleer 
submission, which showed a consistent reduction in 6MWD over the study period in patients receiving 
placebo.  
Thus, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that PAH, WHO functional class III and worse is associated 
with  rapid  deterioration  of  exercise  capacity,  measured  as  6MWD,  also  over  shorter  trial  durations 
than  the  16  weeks  assessed  in  trial  BREATHE-4.  The  mean  and,  consistently  positive  individual 
responses in 6MWD seen in trial BREATHE-4 are considered incompatible with a placebo effect are 
believed to represent a true response to treatment with bosentan.  
The MAH argued that PAH associated with HIV infection is a very rare condition within an already 
Orphan therapy area with an incidence currently estimated to be 0.5% of the HIV positive population. 
Given  its  rarity  and  the  ethical  issues  surrounding  the  use  of  placebo-controlled  studies  in  HIV 
patients, the applicant argued that it is extremely difficult to foresee sufficiently large, prospective and 
placebo-controlled  studies  in  this  population.  However,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  that  the  orphan  drug 
status  cannot  support  by  itself  the  grant  of  a  marketing  authorisation  or  a  specific  indication  when 
strong doubts on benefit/risk ratio are remaining.   
The applicant considered that the beneficial clinical findings from BREATHE-4 must be seen from the 
perspective  of  the  rare  Orphan  disease  of  PAH,  and  in  the  context  of  findings  from  other  studies 
performed in this therapy area.

Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  applicant  agreed  with  the  CHMP  that  the  interpretability  of  the 
findings  from  study  AC-052-362  (BREATHE-4)  are  complicated  by  the  small  patient  numbers  and 
uncontrolled  nature  of  the  study.  Prognosis  is  particularly  poor  in  HIV  patients  who  develop  PAH, 
with an estimated survival rate of 32–46% at 2 years, making the development of PAH a specific rate-
limiting event for survival of patients with HIV. This survival rate is substantially worse than that of 
HIV patients without PAH, making it even more important to provide a treatment option for patients 
with this condition. 
The applicant acknowledged that it is difficult to draw full conclusions regarding the safety of Tracleer 
in the PAH-HIV population from the BREATHE-4 study alone. However, the safety data obtained in 
the 102 PAH-HIV patients entered into the Tracleer PMS database, and discussed in the submission to 
this  variation  application,  provides  a  degree  of  reassurance  regarding  the  safety  of  Tracleer  in  this 
patient population.  
It  is  recognised  that  there  is  a  theoretical  concern  for  increased  hepatotoxicity  of  bosentan  in  PAH-
HIV  patients  due  to  the  multiplicity  of  concomitant  medications  as  well  as  the  high  prevalence  of 
hepatitis B/C co-infection. From the Tracleer PMS database, when compared with the idiopathic PAH 
(IPAH) population, the incidence of reported elevated aminotransferases in the 102 patients with PAH 
associated with HIV was 8.8% versus 8.4% in the IPAH group after a median exposure to bosentan of 
33.4  weeks.  Approximately  28.4%  of  patients  with  PAH  associated  with  HIV  reported  at  least  one 
potential safety signal, compared with 36.7% in the IPAH population. Thus, it does not appear that the 
theoretical  concern  of  increased  hepatotoxic  potential  of  Tracleer  in  patients  with  PAH-HIV 
materialises  in  the  clinical  setting,  although  close  monitoring  is  warranted.  The  Applicant  is  of  the 
opinion that the current risk-management programme, involving at least monthly monitoring of LFTs, 
together with the education programme for new prescribers, is sufficient to manage the hepatotoxicity 
concern in this group. Furthermore, as there is a theoretical concern for greater potential for hepatic 
and haematological toxicity in this population, the Applicant has committed to specifically assess the 
safety  of  the  co-administration  of  bosentan  and  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  in  this  specific 
population within the forthcoming PSURs. 
The data provided by the applicant in the Request for Supplementary Information were considered not 
sufficient to support the approval of the indication in patients with PAH associated to HIV. 
However, since prescribers will probably attempt the use of bosentan in patients with PAH associated 
to  HIV  infection  and  since  there  are  still  strong  doubts  on  a  potential  increase  of  the  risk  of 
hepatotoxicity  and  haematological  toxicity,  and  on  a  decrease  of  the  antiretroviral  drugs  efficacy  to 
control  retroviral  replication,  special  warnings  are  warranted  in  the  SPC.  Moreover,  the  limited 
available data from Breathe 4 have been included in section 5.1 (see section on the SPC).   
The CHMP also noted that there are major uncertainties regarding possible interactions with bosentan 
especially with antiretroviral medicinal products.  
for  pharmacokinetic 
Potential 
interactions  between  bosentan  and  antiretroviral  drugs 
Bosentan is extensively metabolised in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP3A4 
and CYP2C9, with biliary excretion of three identified metabolites as the main route of elimination. 
Upon multiple dosing, plasma concentrations of bosentan decrease gradually to 50–65% of those seen 
after  single-dose  administration,  probably  the  effect  of  auto-induction  of  the  metabolising  liver 
enzymes. Steady-state conditions are reached within 3–5 days. Importantly, bosentan is an inducer of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and possibly CYP2C19 and thus, the exposure to drugs, which are substrates 
for  one  of  these  isoenzymes  may  be  decreased  when  administered  concomitantly  with  bosentan. 
Conversely, a drug, which acts as an inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C9 activity could 
alter the exposure to bosentan when administered concomitantly. 
Based on the above, a pharmacokinetic interaction between bosentan and antiretroviral drugs is likely. 
Bosentan may lower the concentrations of the latter, possibly resulting in reduced efficacy. Interaction 
studies performed with a number of compounds have shown that bosentan may reduce the exposure to 
other drugs by up to 60% although for most compounds a decrease of around 30-40% was observed. 
The MAH considered that the antiretroviral drugs may increase or decrease bosentan concentrations or 
have no effect depending on the antiretroviral drug at issue. When bosentan would be combined with a 
15 
 
 
single antiretroviral, the direction of the effect of the antiretroviral on the exposure to bosentan (i.e., 
decrease  or  increase)  can  be  predicted  although  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  would  need  to  be 
investigated.  However,  in  clinical  practice  monotherapy  is  not  the  standard  of  care  as,  typically, 
antiretroviral therapy consists of at least 3 drugs. A large number of drug combinations is being used. 
To  predict  the  direction  of  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  when  bosentan  is  combined  with  a 
combination of antiretroviral drugs is practically impossible and will depend on the combination used.  
When  ketoconazole,  a  strong  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4,  was  given  concomitantly  with  bosentan,  the 
exposure to bosentan doubled. In the presence of the strong enzyme inducer, rifampicin, the exposure 
to  bosentan  decreased  by  58%.  Based  on  these  results  the  applicant  considered  it  unlikely  that  any 
combination  of  antiretroviral  drugs  will  more  than  double  the  exposure  to  bosentan  or  reduce  it  by 
more than half.  
From  the  above,  it  is  concluded  by  the  applicant  that  bosentan  will  likely  lower  the  exposure  to 
antiretrovirals whereas the effect of antiretrovirals on bosentan exposure cannot be predicted and will 
depend  on  the  combination  of  drugs  tested.  It  should  be  noted  that  an  interaction  study  performed 
between  bosentan  and  an  antiretroviral  therapy  (mono,  dual  or  tri  therapy)  will  give  a  result  that  is 
only valid for the particular combination tested. 
Since bosentan will be inevitably associated with antiretroviral drugs, the assessment of the magnitude 
of the interaction between bosentan and antiretroviral drugs which are metabolized by CYP450 is of 
major  importance  to  document  the  benefit/risk  ratio  of  bosentan  in  the  specific  context  of  PAH 
associated to HIV.   
Well-conducted  studies  assessing  the  drug-drug  interaction  at  steady  state  both  on  bosentan 
concentrations and on antiretroviral drugs concentrations are needed within a short delay. The CHMP 
considered the need to perform, specific interaction studies with the gold standard, lopinavir/ritonavir, 
and  with  the  boosted  PI  commonly  used  in  salvage  therapy  tipranavir/ritonavir;  in  addition  a  study 
with  a  NNRTI  representative  (efavirenz)  will  also  deserve  to  be  explored]  to  provide  clear 
recommendations  to  the  prescribers  as  regards  the  co-administration  of  bosentan  with  PIs  and 
NNRTIs. 
Moreover, it is emphasized that tri therapy (HAART) will most often include 2 NRTI, which are not 
substrates for CYP450, plus 1 PI (or boosted PI) or 1 NNRTI. Thus, the sense and magnitude of the 
interaction  will  mainly  be  driven  by  the  PI  or  the  NNRTI  used  in  the  multitherapy.  The  drug-drug 
interaction  studies  that  will  assess  the  proper  magnitude  of  the  interactions  of  bosentan  with  PI  and 
NNRTI  will  then  be  fully  informative  to  establish  the  level  of  interaction  in  usual  practice  and 
therefore are warranted to document the benefit/risk ratio of bosentan in the context of HIV infection.  
It  must  be  reminded  that  there  is  a  high  risk  of  a  decrease  of  the  plasmatic  concentration  of 
antiretroviral  drugs  PI  and  NNRTI  when  bosentan,  as  a  CYP3A4  and  CYP2C9  (and  possibly 
CYP2C19)  inducer,  is  used  concomitantly.  A  decrease  in  plasmatic  concentration  of  antiretroviral 
drug  would  lead  to  suboptimal  systemic  exposure  of  antiretroviral  drugs  with  a  subsequent  risk  of 
reducing  the  control  of  retroviral  replication  and  possibly  the  emergence  of  resistance  to  PI.  It  is 
emphasized  that  in  this  study  AC-052-362,  five  patients  had  an  increase  in  viral  load.  The 
consequences on the progress of the HIV infection is of major importance to establish the benefit/risk 
ratio of bosentan in the context of HIV infected patients. Moreover, the control of retroviral replication 
may be of high interest to control the progress of PAH itself associated to HIV infection.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  perform  a  drug  drug  interaction  study  with 
antiretrovirals. (see conclusion)

c) safety results  
HIV-1 RNA  titers were little changed after 8 weeks  of bosentan therapy (mean change +0.45 log10 
copies/ml, p = 0.122, paired t test) in the 13 patients who had both baseline and Week-8 assessments. 
This was also true among the seven patients who had < 400 copies/ml at baseline (mean change +0.62 
log10  copies/ml,  p  =  0.196,  paired  t  test).  Overall,  one  patient  improved  during  the  study  (>  400 
copies/ml at baseline and < 400 copies/ml at Week 8, Patient 3/41). (Patients 1/1, 1/7, 1/13, 1/14, and 
3/42;  which  included  the  two  patients  who  were  considered  to  have  worsened  (<  400  copies/ml  at 
baseline and > 400 copies/ml at Week 8, Patients 1/14 and 3/42; Viral load in the two patients who 
worsened increased from < 400 copies/ml at baseline to 441 and 600 copies/ml, respectively, with no 
concomitant decrease in CD4 counts. 
Since there was no effect on indices of HIV progression (CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA titers), no 
summary  evaluation  of  plasma  concentrations  of  protease  inhibitors  or  NNRTIs  was  deemed 
necessary.  
Concentrations in each patient were carefully monitored using published algorithms for comparison. 
Trough concentrations did decrease in some patients but remained unchanged for others for any given 
agent.  The  observed  changes  were  likely  the  result  of  the  heterogeneity  of  drug  regimens,  non 
standardized timing of sample collection, and intra- and inter-individual variability and did not appear 
to adversely impact the control of HIV infection.” 
Hemoglobin concentration  decreased  from  14.8  g/dl  at  baseline  to  11.9  g/dl on  Day 28  and  reached 
marked levels (10.6 g/dl) on the last day of the study (Day 119). ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase 
were markedly increased on Day 56 from normal values at baseline and decreased thereafter without a 
change in study treatment. The mean decrease in hemoglobin concentration (-1.3 g/dl) was consistent 
with  that  observed  in  other  studies.  A  mean  decrease  in  neutrophils  (-0.43  ×  109  cells/L)  was 
observed. 
Eight  patients  had  a  marked  abnormality  in  at  least  one  laboratory  variable.  The  most  common 
abnormality was a marked decrease in neutrophil count, which occurred in five patients (31.3%).  
The marked decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit and the marked increases in ALT, 
AST, and alkaline phosphatase all occurred in a single patient (1/14). 
In addition to Patient 1/14, one other patient (3/42) had an increase in AST to > 3 × ULN. 
However, the increase in AST to 76 U/l on Day 27 was from a baseline value of 66 U/l, and thus, it 
was not a marked increase. This patient was coinfected with the hepatitis C virus. 
No  deaths  occurred  during  the  16-week  treatment  period.  One  patient  died  for  unknown  reasons 
approximately  16  days  after  completing  the  study  while  participating  in  the  compassionate  supply 
program. (The investigator assessed the event as not related to bosentan) 
Given  the  limited  number  of  patients  exposed  to  bosentan  no  formal  conclusion  could  be  drawn  on  the 
safety  profile  of  the  drug  in  HIV  infected  patients,  especially  when  considering  that  given  the  similar 
toxicity targets of bosentan and antiretroviral agents (hematologic and hepatotoxic) a potentialisation could 
not be excluded and is of particular concern.  
Therefore,  the  CHMP  asked  the  applicant  to  commit  to  specifically  assess  the  safety  of  the  co-
administration in this specific population within the forthcoming PSURs 
Conclusion 
In conclusion, the BREATHE-5 study provides evidence that bosentan does not cause a deterioration 
in the SpO2 in patients suffering from  PAH and Eisenmenger’s syndrome. The results regarding the 
pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  the  6  min  walking  test  improved  significantly,  especially  the 
difference in 6 min walk test of about 53 m is considered clinically relevant. Therefore, the benefit/risk 
is considered positive and an amendment of the section 4.1 is considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
The benefit/risk ratio in patients with HIV infection is not established since the safety concerns and 
major  uncertainties,  especially  regarding  the  consequences  and  magnitude  of  drug-drug  interactions 
with antiretroviral drugs that are substrates of CYP450 have not been solved. The provided open label, 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
non comparative study has included a very small group of only 16 patients. Given that there have been 
studies  with  remarkable  positive  placebo  effects  on  the  6-minutes  walk  test  in  the  past,  the  efficacy 
results  from  this  uncontrolled  designed  and  limited  study  are  difficult  to  interpret.  Further  data, 
including  drug-drug  interactions  with  antiretroviral  drugs  PI  (lopinavir/ritonavir),  boosted  PI 
tipranavir/ritonavir  commonly  used  in  salvage  therapy  (since  tipranavir  have  shown  to  have  a  very 
high potential for interaction), and with a NNRTI representative (efavirenz) are requested before any 
indication in patients with HIV can be considered. Bosentan has an inducing effect on CYP450 but the 
magnitude  of  any  potential  interaction  (reducing  antiretroviral  activity  and  variation  of  bosentan 
systemic concentration) of antiretroviral medicinal products, which are substrates for CYP450, has not 
been  documented.  It  is  noticed  that  there  are  some  indications  pointing  to  the  fact  that  one  of  the 
causes of PAH in patients with HIV infection could be the presence of virus particles in blood. Also, 
some  data  suggests  that  the  control  of  retroviral  replication  may  be  of  high  interest  to  control  PAH 
associated to HIV infection. The limited current clinical development without controlled data and the 
lack of essential data in the specific population of patients with HIV infection with remaining strong 
doubts on the benefit/risk ratio preclude the approval of this indication in section 4.1 of the SPC.  
Since prescribers will however certainly attempt the use of bosentan in patients with PAH associated 
to HIV infection and since there are concerns on an increased risk of hepatotoxicity and 
haematological toxicity, and on the decrease of the antiretroviral drugs efficacy to control retroviral 
replication, special warnings are warranted in section 4.4. of the SPC. The state of the art in the field 
of HIV infection from BREATHE-4 can be accepted as an information to be included in section 5.1. 
of the SPC. Individual paragraph on adverse effects in Eisenmenger’s syndrome population and HIV 
infected patients have been included in section 4.8 and 5.1. 
The  MAH  has  committed  in  writing  to  conduct  a  pharmacokinetic  drug-drug  interaction  study 
between bosentan and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) in healthy volunteers. A protocol will be forwarded 
to the rapporteur/CHMP for review before the end of 2006, to complete the study and submit a final 
study report to the CHMP by Q42007. 
In addition, further drug-drug interactions, one with boosted PI tipranavir/ritonavir commonly used in 
salvage  therapy  (since  tipranavir  have  shown  to  have  a  very  high  potential  for  interaction),  and  the 
other  with  a  NNRTI  representative  (efavirenz)  will  be  considered  by  the  CHMP  pending  the 
interpretability  of  the  results  of  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  results  and  their  perceived  usefulness  to  the 
prescriber. 
I.3.3. Other clinical diseases included in Group 1 i.e. PAH of Venice 2003 classification: 
The applicant has not provided new data regarding the other indications that are suggested in addition 
to the one already approved and the ones that have been assessed above.  
Only casual experiences from limited cases are reported   
It should also be noted that Tracleer cannot be recognized as the treatment for some items included in 
the Venice classification under the designation “pulmonary arterial hypertension”: i.e. : association to 
significant venous or capillary involvement, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 
II  OVERALL RECOMMENDATION FOR THE LABELLING 
Based on the review of the data on safety and efficacy, the variation application EMEA/H/C/401/II/27 
for Tracleer 62.5 mg and 125 mg, film coated tablets (bosentan) to change the extend of the indication 
to cardiac shunt associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s 
syndrome is acceptable. 
The extension of the indication to PAH associated to HIV infection claimed by the MAH is not 
approvable.  Therefore, the CHMP recommended wording in section 4.1 should read: 
“Treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in 
patients with grade III functional status. Efficacy has been shown in: 
• Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
• PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s 
physiology. 
The revised SPC includes also amendments to the sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 derived from the data 
provided in this variation described below:   
Section 4.4 Special warning and precaution for use : 
 “The  benefit/risk  balance  of  bosentan  has  not  been  established  in  patients  with  WHO  class  I  or  II 
functional  status  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension.  No  studies  have  been  performed  in  secondary 
pulmonary hypertension other than related to connective tissue disease (primarily scleroderma)”. 
The additional paragraph in section 4.4 was slightly modified by the CHMP during the review process: 
“Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV infection 
There is limited clinical trial experience with the use of Tracleer in patients with PAH associated with 
HIV infection, treated with antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.1). No specific interaction 
studies  between  bosentan  and  antiretroviral  medicinal  products  have  been  performed.  Due  to  the 
potential  for  such  interactions  especially  related  to  the  inducing  effect  of  bosentan  on  CYP450  (see 
section  4.5),  which  could  affect  the  efficacy  of  antiretroviral  therapy,  these  patients  should  be 
monitored carefully regarding control of their HIV infection. An increased risk of hepatic toxicity and 
haematological  adverse  events  cannot  be  excluded  when  bosentan  is  used  in  combination  with 
antiretroviral medicinal products.” 
Section 4.8  Undesirable effects  
Addition of the following wording further discussion with the applicant during the RSI assessment:  
“Placebo-controlled trial in PAH associated with congenital heart disease (BREATHE-5) 
The safety profile of Tracleer in this population was  similar to that observed in the pivotal trials in 
patients  with  PAH.  Adverse  events  that  occurred  in  a  greater  proportion  of  patients  on  Tracleer 
62.5 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 125 mg twice daily (n = 37) than on placebo (n = 17) 
included peripheral oedema (18.9% vs. 5.9%), headache (13.5% vs. 11.8%), palpitations (10.8% vs. 
0%),  dizziness  (8.1%  vs.  5.9%)  and  chest  pain  (8.1%  vs.  0%).  Four  patients  discontinued  due  to 
adverse events, two (5.4%) in the bosentan group and two (11.8%) in the placebo group. 
“Uncontrolled trial in patients with PAH associated with HIV infection (BREATHE-4) 
The safety profile in this population (n = 16) when treated with Tracleer 62.5 mg twice daily for four 
weeks,  followed  by  125 mg  twice  daily  was  similar  to  that  observed  in  the  pivotal  trials  in  patients 
with  PAH.  The  most  frequent  adverse  events  were  peripheral  oedema  (31%),  headache  (19%), 
abnormal  liver  function  (13%),  muscle  cramps  (13%),  fluid  retention  (13%)  and  vomiting  (13%). 
Haematological  abnormalities  (anaemia  and  decrease  in  neutrophil  count)  were  observed  in  some 
patients (see section 4.4).” 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties: 
The paragraph describing study in patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome is added : 
“In  a  prospective,  multi-centre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  (BREATHE-5), 
patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension WHO functional Class III and Eisenmenger physiology 
associated with congenital heart disease received Tracleer 62.5 mg bid for 4 weeks, then 125 mg b.i.d. 
for a further 12 weeks (n = 37), or placebo (n = 17). The primary objective was to show that Tracleer 
did  not  worsen  hypoxaemia.  After  16  weeks,  the  mean  oxygen  saturation  was  increased  in  the 
bosentan  group  by  1.0%  (95%  CI  –0.7;  2.8%)  as  compared  to  the  placebo  group,  showing  that 
bosentan  did  not  worsen  hypoxemia.  The  mean  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  was  significantly 
reduced in the bosentan group, (with a predominant effect observed in the subgroup of patients with 
bidirectional  intracardiac  shunt).  After  16  weeks,  the  mean  placebo-corrected  increase  in  6-minute 
walk distance was 53 meters (p = 0.0079) reflecting improvement of exercise capacity.” 
19 
 
 
  
The paragraph regarding PAH in HIV infected patients was amended following the RSI and further 
discussion with applicant taking into account the following remarks from the CHMP:  
It should be made clear for the prescribers that only exploratory data are derived from study AC-O52-
362 and no data are available to appreciate the effect in HIV infected patients beyond 16 weeks 
The paragraph below was finally agreed. 
An open label, non-comparative study (AC-052-362; BREATHE-4) was performed in 16 patients with 
WHO Class III PAH associated with HIV infection. Patients were treated with Tracleer 62.5 mg bid 
for  4  weeks  followed  by  125  mg  bid  for  a  further  12  weeks.  After  16 weeks  treatment,  there  were 
significant  improvements  from  baseline  in  exercise  capacity:  mean  increase  in  6-minute  walk  test: 
+91.4 meters from 332.6 meters on average at baseline (p < 0.001). As part of the safety assessment, 
the  effect  of  bosentan  on  the  antiretroviral  therapy  (i.e.  reduced  systemic  concentrations  of  the  co-
administered antiretroviral agents with a potential negative impact on the efficacy of the antiretroviral 
therapy)  was  assessed  through  CD4  cell  counts  and  HIV-1  RNA  titers.  Given  the  limitations  of  the 
study  (small  number  of  patients,  non-standardized  pharmacokinetic  investigation  of  antiretroviral 
drugs, heterogeneity of drug regimens), no formal conclusion can be drawn regarding the effects of 
bosentan  on  antiretroviral  drug  efficacy.  An  increase  in  HIV  viral  load  was  observed  in  5  patients 
(See also Section 4.4). No clinical data are available after 16 weeks from this study. 
III.  CONCLUSION 
-  On 21 September 2006, the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed 
on  the  amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet.

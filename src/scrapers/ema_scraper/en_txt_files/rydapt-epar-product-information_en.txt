CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rydapt is indicated: 
• 
in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high-dose cytarabine 
consolidation chemotherapy, and for patients in complete response followed by Rydapt single 
agent maintenance therapy, for adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) who are FLT3 mutation-positive (see section 4.2); 
as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis 
(ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast 
cell leukaemia (MCL). 
• 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with Rydapt should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer 
therapies. 
Before taking midostaurin, AML patients must have confirmation of FLT3 mutation (internal tandem 
duplication [ITD] or tyrosine kinase domain [TKD]) using a validated test. 
Posology 
Rydapt should be taken orally twice daily at approximately 12-hour intervals. The capsules should be 
taken with food (see sections 4.5 and 5.2). 
Prophylactic antiemetics should be administered in accordance with local medical practice as per 
patient tolerance.

AML 
The recommended dose of Rydapt is 50 mg orally twice daily. 
Rydapt is dosed on days 8-21 of induction and consolidation chemotherapy cycles, and then for 
patients in complete response every day as single agent maintenance therapy until relapse for up to 
12 cycles of 28 days each (see section 4.1). In patients receiving a haematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(SCT), Rydapt should be discontinued 48 hours prior to the conditioning regimen for SCT. 
Dose modifications in AML 
Recommendations for dose modifications of Rydapt in patients with AML are provided in Table 1.

Rydapt dosing 
Interrupt Rydapt for the remainder of the cycle. 
Resume Rydapt at the same dose when infiltrate 
resolves to Grade ≤1. 
Interrupt Rydapt until toxicities considered at 
least possibly related to Rydapt have resolved to 
Grade ≤2, then resume Rydapt. 
Decrease Rydapt to 50 mg once daily for the 
remainder of the cycle. Resume Rydapt at the 
initial dose in the next cycle provided that QTc 
interval improves to ≤470 msecs at the start of 
that cycle. Otherwise continue Rydapt 50 mg 
once daily. 
Withhold or interrupt Rydapt for the remainder 
of the cycle. If QTc improves to ≤470 msecs just 
prior to the next cycle, resume Rydapt at the 
initial dose. If QTc interval is not improved in 
time to start the next cycle do not administer 
Rydapt during that cycle. Rydapt may be held 
for as many cycles as necessary until QTc 
improves. 
Interrupt Rydapt until ANC ≥1.0 x 109/l, then 
resume at 50 mg twice daily. 
If neutropenia (ANC <1.0 x 109/l) 
persists >2 weeks and is suspected to be related 
to Rydapt, discontinue Rydapt. 
Persistent Grade 1 or 2 toxicity that patients 
deem unacceptable may prompt an interruption 
for as many as 28 days.

Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required in patients aged over 65 years (see section 5.2). In patients aged 
≥60 years, Rydapt should be used only in patients eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy 
with adequate performance status and without significant comorbidities. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Clinical 
experience in patients with severe renal impairment is limited and no data are available in patients 
with end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate (Child-Pugh A or B) hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2). Exposure to midostaurin and its active metabolite CGP62221 is 
substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic impairment than that in patients with normal hepatic 
function (see section 5.2). However, there are insufficient efficacy data in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment to suggest a dose adjustment is required. 
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia 
Rydapt has not been studied in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia and therefore its use is not 
recommended in this patient population. 
Paediatric population 
Rydapt should not be used in combination with intensive paediatric AML combination chemotherapy 
regimens including anthracyclines, fludarabine and cytarabine because of the risk of prolonged 
haematological recovery (such as prolonged severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Rydapt is for oral use. 
The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. They should not be opened, crushed or 
chewed to ensure proper dosing and avoid the unpleasant taste of the capsule content. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers, e.g. rifampicin, St. John’s Wort (Hypericum 
perforatum), carbamazepine, enzalutamide, phenytoin (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neutropenia and infections 
Neutropenia has occurred in patients receiving Rydapt as monotherapy and in combination with 
chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Severe neutropenia (ANC <0.5 x 109/l) was generally reversible by 
withholding Rydapt until recovery and discontinuation in the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL studies. 
White blood cell counts (WBCs) should be monitored regularly, especially at treatment initiation. 
In patients who develop unexplained severe neutropenia, treatment with Rydapt should be interrupted 
until ANC is ≥1.0 x 109/l, as recommended in Tables 1 and 2. Rydapt should be discontinued in 
patients who develop recurrent or prolonged severe neutropenia that is suspected to be related to 
Rydapt (see section 4.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any active serious infection should be under control prior to starting treatment with Rydapt 
monotherapy. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, including any 
device-related infections, and if a diagnosis of infection is made appropriate treatment must be 
instituted promptly, including, as needed, the discontinuation of Rydapt. 
Cardiac dysfunction 
Patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure were excluded from clinical studies. In the ASM, 
SM-AHN and MCL studies cardiac dysfunction such as congestive heart failure (CHF) (including 
some fatalities) and transient decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) occurred. In the 
randomised AML study no difference in CHF was observed between the Rydapt + chemotherapy and 
placebo + chemotherapy arms. In patients at risk, Rydapt should be used with caution and the patient 
closely monitored by assessing LVEF when clinically indicated (at baseline and during treatment). 
An increased frequency of QTc prolongation was noted in midostaurin–treated patients (see 
section 4.8), however, a mechanistic explanation for this observation was not found. Caution is 
warranted in patients at risk of QTc prolongation (e.g. due to concomitant medicinal products and/or 
electrolyte disturbances). Interval assessments of QT by ECG should be considered if Rydapt is taken 
concurrently with medicinal products that can prolong QT interval. 
Pulmonary toxicity 
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pneumonitis, in some cases fatal, have occurred in patients treated 
with Rydapt monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients should be monitored for 
pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis and Rydapt discontinued in patients who 
experience pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis without an infectious aetiology that 
are ≥Grade 3 (NCI CTCAE). 
Embryofoetal toxicity and breast-feeding 
Pregnant women should be informed of the potential risk to a foetus; females of reproductive potential 
should be advised to have a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment with Rydapt and to 
use effective contraception during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after stopping 
treatment. 
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding infants from Rydapt, women 
should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after 
stopping treatment (see section 4.6). 
Paediatric patients 
Rydapt should not be used in combination with intensive paediatric AML combination 
chemotherapy regimens including anthracyclines, fludarabine and cytarabine because of the risk of 
prolonged haematological recovery (such as prolonged severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Severe renal impairment 
Caution is warranted when considering the administration of midostaurin in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end-stage renal disease and patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity (see 
section 5.2).

Interactions 
Caution is required when concomitantly prescribing with midostaurin medicinal products that are 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as, but not limited to, antifungals (e.g. ketoconazole), certain 
antivirals (e.g. ritonavir), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin) and nefazodone because they can 
increase the plasma concentrations of midostaurin especially when (re-)starting with midostaurin 
treatment (see section 4.5). Alternative medicinal products that do not strongly inhibit CYP3A4 
activity should be considered. In situations where satisfactory therapeutic alternatives do not exist, 
patients should be closely monitored for midostaurin-related toxicity. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains macrogolglycerol hydroxystearate, which may cause stomach 
discomfort and diarrhoea. 
This medicinal product contains 666 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 200 mg dose (maximum daily 
dose), which is equivalent to 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous. The amount in a 200 mg dose of this 
medicine is equivalent to 17 ml beer or 7 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will 
not have any noticeable effects. Alcohol may be harmful in patients with alcohol-related problems, 
epilepsy or liver problems or during pregnancy or breast-feeding. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Midostaurin undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism mainly through CYP3A4 enzymes which are 
either induced or inhibited by a number of concomitant medicinal products. 
Effect of other medicinal products on Rydapt 
Medicinal products or substances known to affect the activity of CYP3A4 may affect the plasma 
concentrations of midostaurin and therefore the safety and/or efficacy of Rydapt. 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Concomitant use of Rydapt with strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampicin, 
enzalutamide, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) is contraindicated (see 
section 4.3). Strong CYP3A4 inducers decrease exposure of midostaurin and its active metabolites 
(CGP52421 and CGP62221). In a study in healthy subjects, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 
inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily) to steady state with a 50 mg single dose of midostaurin decreased 
midostaurin Cmax by 73% and AUCinf by 96% on average, respectively. CGP62221 exhibited a similar 
pattern. The mean AUClast of CGP52421 decreased by 60%. 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase midostaurin blood concentrations. In a study with 36 healthy 
subjects, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole to steady state with a single 
dose of 50 mg midostaurin led to a significant increase in midostaurin exposure (1.8-fold Cmax increase 
and 10-fold AUCinf increase) and 3.5-fold increase in AUCinf of CGP62221, while the Cmax of the 
active metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421) decreased by half (see section 5.2). At steady state of 
midostaurin (50 mg twice daily for 21 days), with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole at steady 
state in a subset of patients (N=7), midostaurin steady-state exposure (Cmin) was increased by 
2.09-fold. Cmin of CGP52421 was increased by 1.3-fold, whereas no significant effect in exposure of 
CGP62221 was observed (see section 4.4). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of Rydapt on other medicinal products 
Substrates of CYP enzymes 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single dose of bupropion (CYP2B6 substrate) with multiple 
doses of midostaurin (50 mg twice daily) at steady state decreased bupropion AUCinf and AUClast by 
48% and 49% respectively and Cmax by 55% compared to administration of bupropion alone. This 
indicates that midostaurin is a mild inducer of CYP2B6. Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic 
range that are substrates of CYP2B6 (e.g. bupropion or efavirenz) should be used with caution when 
administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal 
exposure. 
Based on in-vitro data, midostaurin and its active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221, are 
inhibitors of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 and inducers of CYP1A2. Therefore, medicinal products with a 
narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g. tizanidine) and CYP2E1 (e.g. 
chlorzoxazone) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and 
may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure. 
Substrates of transporters 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single dose of rosuvastatin (BCRP substrate) with a single 
dose of midostaurin (100 mg) increased rosuvastatin AUCinf and AUClast by 37% and 48% 
respectively; Cmax was approximately doubled (2.01 times) compared to administration of rosuvastatin 
alone. This indicates that midostaurin has a mild inhibitory effect on BCRP substrates. Medicinal 
products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of the transporter BCRP (e.g. rosuvastatin 
or atorvastatin) should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with midostaurin, and 
may need dose adjustment to maintain optimal exposure. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
There was no clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between multiple doses of 
midostaurin (50 mg twice daily) at steady state and oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and 
levonorgestrel in healthy women. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the contraceptive reliability of 
this combination will be compromised by co-administration of midostaurin. 
Food interactions 
In healthy subjects, midostaurin absorption (AUC) was increased by an average of 22% when Rydapt 
was co-administered with a standard meal and by an average of 59% when co-administered with a 
high-fat meal. Peak midostaurin concentration (Cmax) was reduced by 20% with a standard meal and 
by 27% with a high-fat meal versus on an empty stomach (see section 5.2). 
Rydapt is recommended to be administered with food. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should be informed that animal studies show midostaurin to be 
harmful to the developing foetus. Sexually active women of childbearing potential are advised to have 
a pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment with Rydapt and that they should use 
effective contraception (methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) when using Rydapt and 
for at least 4 months after stopping treatment with Rydapt. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Midostaurin can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate 
and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated 
that midostaurin induced foetotoxicity (see section 5.3). Rydapt is not recommended during pregnancy 
or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant women should be advised of 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether midostaurin or its active metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available 
animal data have shown that midostaurin and its active metabolites pass into the milk of lactating rats. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Rydapt and for at least 4 months after 
stopping treatment. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of Rydapt on human fertility. Animal studies with midostaurin have 
shown impaired fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Rydapt has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and vertigo have been 
reported in patients taking Rydapt and should be considered when assessing a patient’s ability to drive 
or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
AML 
The safety evaluation of Rydapt (50 mg twice daily) in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated 
AML is based on a phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 717 patients. 
The overall median duration of exposure was 42 days (range 2 to 576 days) for patients in the Rydapt 
plus standard chemotherapy arm versus 34 days (range 1 to 465 days) for patients in the placebo plus 
standard chemotherapy arm. For the 205 patients (120 in Rydapt arm and 85 in placebo arm) who 
entered the maintenance phase, the median duration of exposure in maintenance was 11 months for 
both arms (16 to 520 days for patients in the Rydapt arm and 22 to 381 days in the placebo arm). 
The most frequent adverse reactions (ARs) in the Rydapt arm were febrile neutropenia (83.4%), 
nausea (83.4%), exfoliative dermatitis (61.6%), vomiting (60.7%), headache (45.9%), petechiae 
(35.8%) and pyrexia (34.5%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ARs were febrile neutropenia (83.5%), 
lymphopenia (20.0%), device-related infection (15.7%), exfoliative dermatitis (13.6%), 
hyperglycaemia (7.0%) and nausea (5.8%). The most frequent laboratory abnormalities were 
haemoglobin decreased (97.3%), ANC decreased (86.7%), ALT increased (84.2%), AST increased 
(73.9%) and hypokalaemia (61.7%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were ANC 
decreased (85.8%), haemoglobin decreased (78.5%), ALT increased (19.4%) and hypokalaemia 
(13.9%). 
Serious ARs occurred at similar rates in patients in the Rydapt versus the placebo arm. The most 
frequent serious AR in both arms was febrile neutropenia (16%). 
Discontinuation due to any adverse reaction occurred in 3.1% of patients in the Rydapt arm versus 
1.3% in the placebo arm. The most frequent Grade 3/4 adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in 
the Rydapt arm was exfoliative dermatitis (1.2%).

Safety profile during maintenance phase 
While Table 3 provides the incidence for ARs over the total duration of the study, when the 
maintenance phase (single agent Rydapt or placebo) was assessed separately, a difference in the type 
and severity of ARs was observed. The overall incidence of ARs during the maintenance phase was 
generally lower than during the induction and consolidation phase. Incidences of ARs were, however, 
higher in the Rydapt arm than in the placebo arm during the maintenance phase. ARs occurring more 
often in the midostaurin arm versus placebo during maintenance included: nausea (46.4% versus 
17.9%), hyperglycaemia (20.2% versus 12.5%), vomiting (19% versus 5.4%) and QT prolongation 
(11.9% versus 5.4%). 
Most of the haematological abnormalities reported occurred during the induction and consolidation 
phase when the patients received Rydapt or placebo in combination with chemotherapy. The most 
frequent Grade 3/4 haematological abnormalities reported in patients during the maintenance phase 
with Rydapt were ANC decrease (20.8% versus 18.8%) and leukopenia (7.5% versus 5.9%). 
ARs reported during the maintenance phase led to discontinuation of 1.2% of patients in the Rydapt 
arm and none in the placebo arm. 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL 
The safety of Rydapt (100 mg twice daily) as a single agent in patients with ASM, SM-AHN and 
MCL was evaluated in 142 patients in two single-arm, open-label, multicentre studies. The median 
duration of exposure to Rydapt was 11.4 months (range: 0 to 81 months). 
The most frequent ARs were nausea (82%), vomiting (68%), diarrhoea (51%), peripheral oedema 
(35%) and fatigue (31%). The most frequent Grade 3/4 ARs were fatigue (8.5%), sepsis (7.7%), 
pneumonia (7%), febrile neutropenia (7%), and diarrhoea (6.3%). The most frequent 
non-haematological laboratory abnormalities were hyperglycaemia (93.7%), total bilirubin increased 
(40.1%), lipase increased (39.4%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (33.8%), and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased (33.1%), while the most frequent haematological laboratory 
abnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (73.2%) and ANC decreased (58.5%). The 
most frequent Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (45.8%), 
ANC decreased (26.8%), hyperglycaemia (19%), and lipase increased (17.6%). 
Dose modifications (interruption or adjustment) due to ARs occurred in 31% of patients. The most 
frequent ARs that led to dose modification (incidence ≥5%) were nausea and vomiting. 
ARs that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in 9.2% of patients. The most frequent (incidence 
≥1%) were febrile neutropenia, nausea, vomiting and pleural effusion. 
Tabulated lists of adverse reactions 
ARs are listed according to MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ARs are 
ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first, using the following convention (CIOMS 
III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing 
seriousness.

1For trial sites in North America, all grades were collected for 13 pre-specified adverse events. For all 
other adverse events, only grades 3 and 4 were collected. Therefore, all grade AEs are summarised 
only for patients in non-North American trial sites, whereas Grades 3 and 4 are summarised for 
patients in all trial sites. 
2This AR was included after identification in the post-marketing setting. Interstitial lung disease has 
been derived from post-marketing experience with Rydapt via spontaneous case reports and literature 
cases. No cases of interstitial lung disease were reported in the phase III study.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in AML, ASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients. In ASM, 
SM-AHN and MCL patients these events led to dose adjustment or interruption in 26% and to 
discontinuation in 4.2% of the patients. Most of the events occurred within the first 6 months of 
treatment and were managed with supportive prophylactic medicinal products. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reported experience with overdose in humans is very limited. Single doses of up to 600 mg have been 
given with acceptable acute tolerability. Adverse reactions observed were diarrhoea, abdominal pain 
and vomiting. 
There is no known specific antidote for midostaurin. In the event of an overdose, patients must be 
closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic and 
supportive treatment initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX10 
Mechanism of action 
Midostaurin inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including FLT3 and KIT kinase. Midostaurin 
inhibits FLT3 receptor signalling and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in leukaemic cells 
expressing FLT3 ITD or TKD mutant receptors or over-expressing FLT3 wild type receptors. In vitro 
data indicate that midostaurin inhibits D816V mutant KIT receptors at exposure levels achieved in 
patients (average achieved exposure higher than IC50). In vitro data indicate that KIT wild type 
receptors are inhibited to a much lesser extent at these concentrations (average achieved exposure 
lower than IC50). Midostaurin interferes with aberrant KIT D816V-mediated signalling and inhibits 
mast cell proliferation, survival and histamine release. 
In addition, midostaurin inhibits several other receptor tyrosine kinases such as PDGFR 
(platelet-derived growth factor receptor) or VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), 
as well as members of the serine/threonine kinase family PKC (protein kinase C). Midostaurin binds to 
the catalytic domain of these kinases and inhibits the mitogenic signalling of the respective growth 
factors in cells, resulting in growth arrest. 
Midostaurin in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (cytarabine, doxorubicin, idarubicin and 
daunorubicin) resulted in synergistic growth inhibition in FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell lines. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Two major metabolites have been identified in murine models and humans, i.e. CGP62221 and 
CGP52421. In proliferation assays with FLT3-ITD expressing cells, CGP62221 showed similar 
potency compared to the parent compound, however CGP52421 was approximately 10-fold less 
potent. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
A dedicated QT study in 192 healthy subjects with a dose of 75 mg twice daily did not reveal 
clinically significant prolongation of QT by midostaurin and CGP62221 but the study duration was not 
long enough to estimate the QTc prolongation effects of the long-acting metabolite CGP52421. 
Therefore, the change from baseline in QTcF with the concentration of midostaurin and both 
metabolites was further explored in a phase II study in 116 patients with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL. At 
the median peak Cmin concentrations attained at a dose of 100 mg twice daily, neither midostaurin, 
CGP62221 nor CGP52421 showed a potential to cause clinically significant QTcF prolongation, since 
the upper bounds of predicted change at these concentration levels were less than 10 msecs (5.8, 2.4, 
and 4.0 msecs, respectively). In the ASM, SM-AHN and MCL population, 25.4% of patients had at 
least one ECG measurement with a QTcF greater than 450 ms and 4.7% greater than 480 ms.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
AML 
The efficacy and safety of midostaurin in combination with standard chemotherapy versus placebo 
plus standard chemotherapy and as single agent maintenance therapy was investigated in 717 patients 
(18 to 60 years of age) in a randomised, double-blind, phase III study. Patients with newly diagnosed 
FLT3-mutated AML as determined by a clinical study assay were randomised (1:1) to receive 
midostaurin 50 mg twice daily (n=360) or placebo (n=357) sequentially in combination with standard 
daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 daily on days 1-3) / cytarabine (200 mg/m2 daily on days 1-7) induction and 
high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5) consolidation, followed by continuous 
midostaurin or placebo treatment according to initial assignment for up to 12 additional cycles 
(28 days/cycle). While the study included patients with various AML-related cytogenetic 
abnormalities, patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (M3) or therapy-related AML were 
excluded. Patients were stratified by FLT3 mutation status: TKD, ITD with allelic ratio <0.7, and ITD 
with allelic ratio ≥0.7. 
The two treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics of 
disease characteristics. The median age of the patients was 47 years (range: 18 to 60 years), a majority 
of the patients had ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (88.3%), and most patients had de novo AML 
(95%). Of the patients with race information reported, 88.1% were Caucasian. The majority of patients 
(77.4%) had FLT3-ITD mutations, most of them (47.6%) with a low allelic ratio (<0.7), and 22.6% of 
patients had FLT3-TKD mutations. Forty-eight per cent were male in the midostaurin arm and 41% in 
the placebo arm. 
Patients who proceeded to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) stopped receiving study 
treatment prior to the start of the SCT conditioning regimen. The overall rate of SCT was 59.4% 
(214/360) of patients in the midostaurin plus standard chemotherapy arm versus 55.2% (197/357) in 
the placebo plus standard chemotherapy arm. All patients were followed for survival. 
The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomisation 
until death by any cause. The primary analysis was conducted after a minimum follow-up of 
approximately 3.5 years after the randomisation of the last patient. The study demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in OS with a 23% risk reduction of death for midostaurin plus 
standard chemotherapy over placebo plus standard chemotherapy (see Table 6 and Figure 1).

The key secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS; an EFS event is defined as a failure to 
obtain a complete remission (CR) within 60 days of initiation of protocol therapy, or relapse, or death 
from any cause). The EFS showed a statistically significant improvement for midostaurin plus 
standard chemotherapy over placebo plus standard chemotherapy (HR: 0.78 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93] 
p = 0.0024), and a median EFS of 8.2 months and 3.0 months, respectively; see Table 5.

There was a trend favouring midostaurin for CR rate by day 60 for the midostaurin arm (58.9% versus 
53.5%; p = 0.073) that continued when considering all CRs during induction (65.0% versus 58.0%; 
p = 0.027). In addition, in patients who achieved complete remission during induction, the cumulative 
incidence of relapse at 12 months was 26% in the midostaurin arm versus 41% in the placebo arm.

Sensitivity analyses for both OS and EFS when censored at the time of SCT also supported the clinical 
benefit with midostaurin plus standard chemotherapy over placebo. 
Results for OS by SCT status are shown in Figure 2. For EFS, considering complete remissions within 
60 days of study treatment start, the HR was 0.602 (95% CI: 0.372, 0.974) for patients with SCT and 
0.827 (95% CI: 0.689, 0.993) for patients without SCT, favouring midostaurin.

Efficacy and safety in patients >60-70 years old were evaluated as part of a phase II, single-arm, 
investigator-initiated study of midostaurin in combination with intensive induction, consolidation 
including allogenic SCT and single-agent maintenance in patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML. 
Based on the final analysis, the EFS rate at 2 years (primary endpoint) was 34% (95% CI: 27, 44) and 
the median OS was 22.7 months in patients older than 60 years of age (128 out of 440 patients).

ASM, SM-AHN and MCL 
The efficacy of midostaurin in patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL, collectively referred to as 
advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM), was evaluated in two open-label, single-arm, multicentre 
studies (142 patients in total). 
The pivotal study was a multicentre, single-arm phase II study in 116 patients with advanced SM 
(Study CPKC412D2201). Midostaurin was administered orally at 100 mg twice daily until disease 
progression or intolerable toxicity. Of the 116 patients enrolled, 89 were considered eligible for 
response assessment and constituted the primary efficacy population. Of these, 73 patients had ASM 
(57 with an AHN) and 16 patients had MCL (6 with an AHN). The median age in the primary efficacy 
population was 64 years with approximately half of the patients ≥65 years. Approximately one third 
(36%) received prior anti-neoplastic therapy for ASM, SM-AHN or MCL. At baseline in the primary 
efficacy population, 65% of the patients had >1 measurable C finding (thrombocytopenia, 
hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, high total bilirubin, transfusion-dependent anaemia, weight loss, 
neutropenia, high ALT or high AST). The KIT D816V mutation was detected in 82% of patients. 
The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Response rates were assessed based on the 
modified Valent and Cheson criteria and responses were adjudicated by a study steering committee. 
Secondary endpoints included duration of response, time to response, and overall survival. Responses 
to midostaurin are shown in Table 7. Activity was observed regardless of number of prior therapies, 
and presence or absence of an AHN. Confirmed responses were observed in both KIT D816V 
mutation positive patients (ORR=63%) and KIT D816V wild type or unknown patients 
(ORR=43.8%). However, the median survival for KIT D816V positive patients was longer, i.e. 
33.9 months (95% CI: 20.7, 42), than for KIT D816V wild type or unknown patients, i.e. 10 months 
(95% CI: 6.9, 17.4). Forty-six percent of patients had a decrease in bone marrow infiltration that 
exceeded 50% and 58% had a decrease in serum tryptase levels that exceeded 50%. Spleen volume 
decreased by ≥10% in 68.9% of patients with at least 1 post-baseline assessment (26.7% of patients 
had a reduction of ≥35%, which correlates with a 50% decrease by palpation). 
The median time to response was 0.3 months (range: 0.1 to 3.7 months). The median duration of 
follow-up was 43 months.

Although the study was designed to be assessed with the modified Valent and Cheson criteria, as a 
post-hoc exploratory analysis, efficacy was also assessed per the 2013 International Working 
Group - Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment - European Competence Network on 
Mastocytosis (IWG-MRT-ECNM) consensus criteria. Response to Rydapt was determined using a 
computational algorithm applied without any adjudication. Out of 116 patients, 113 had a C-finding as 
defined by IWG response criteria (excluding ascites as a C-finding). All responses were considered 
and required a 12-week confirmation (see Table 8).

Patients who received non-study anti-neoplastic therapy were considered as having progressed at the 
time of the new therapy. 
The supportive study was a single-arm, multicentre, open-label phase II study of 26 patients with 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL (CPKC412A2213). Midostaurin was administered orally at 100 mg twice 
daily in cycles of 28 days. Lack of a major response (MR) or partial response (PR) by the end of the 
second cycle required discontinuation from the study treatment. Twenty (76.9%) patients had ASM 
(17 [85%] with AHN) and 6 patients (23.1%) had MCL (2 [33.3%] with AHN). The median age was 
64.5 years with half of the patients ≥65 years). At baseline, 88.5% had >1 C finding and 69.2% had 
received at least one prior anti-neoplastic regimen. 
The primary endpoint was ORR evaluated by the Valent criteria during the first two cycles of 
treatment. Nineteen patients (73.1%; 95% CI = [52.2, 88.4]) achieved a response during the first two 
cycles of treatment (13 MR; 6 PR). The median duration of follow-up was 73 months, and the median 
duration of response has not been reached. Median overall survival was 40.0 months (patients were 
only followed up for one year after treatment discontinuation for survival).

Paediatric population 
In a phase II study, midostaurin was investigated in combination with chemotherapy in newly 
diagnosed paediatric patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Among the three FLT3-mutated AML 
patients enrolled in the study, two patients (10 and 14 years old) experienced dose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) following the second induction cycle with midostaurin (at 30 mg/m2 twice daily) in 
combination with chemotherapy (containing cytarabine 2 g/m2/day, day 1-5; fludarabine 
30 mg/m2/day, day 1-5 and idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day, day 2, 4 and 6). Both patients showed markedly 
delayed haematological recoveries (i.e. prolonged grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting for 44 days in the 
first patient and 51 days in the second patient and grade 4 neutropenia lasting for 46 days in the second 
patient). In the first induction cycle both patients received midostaurin in combination with cytarabine, 
etoposide and idarubicin. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rydapt in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant mastocytosis and mast 
cell leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Rydapt in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of acute myeloid 
leukaemia (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Midostaurin is a compound with good absorption and poor solubility. Two of its metabolites 
demonstrated pharmacological activities (CGP52421 and CGP62221). Following multiple doses, the 
pharmacokinetics of midostaurin and CGP62221 were time-dependent, with an initial increase 
observed in the first week followed by a decline of concentrations until reaching steady state on 
day 28. CGP52421 concentrations do not appear to decline as significantly as for midostaurin and 
CGP62221. 
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability of midostaurin following oral administration is not known. 
In humans, the absorption of midostaurin was rapid after oral administration, with Tmax of total 
radioactivity observed at 1-3 hours post dose. The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that 
the absorption in patients was less than dose proportional at doses >50 mg twice daily. 
In healthy subjects, after administration of a single dose of 50 mg midostaurin with food, AUC of 
midostaurin was increased to 20 800 ng*h/ml and Cmax was decreased to 963 ng/ml (see section 4.5). 
Similarly, for CGP52421 and CGP62221 AUC increased to 19 000 and 29 200 ng*h/ml and Cmax 
decreased to 172 and 455 ng/ml, respectively. Time to peak concentration was also delayed in the 
presence of a high-fat meal. Tmax was delayed for all entities, midostaurin median Tmax was 3 h, and for 
CGP52421 and CGP62221 Tmax was delayed to 6 and 7 hours respectively. 
In clinical studies, the efficacy and safety of Rydapt were investigated following administration with a 
light meal. After oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of midostaurin under fed conditions in 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients, AUCinf, Cmax and Tmax were 49 600 ng*h/ml, 2 940 ng/ml and 3 h, 
respectively, for midostaurin. For CGP52421, AUC0-12h and Cmax were 2 770 ng*h/ml and 299 ng/ml, 
respectively. AUC0-12h and Cmax for CGP62221 were 8 700 ng*h/ml and 931 ng/ml, respectively. After 
100 mg bid multiple oral doses of midostaurin the Cmin,ss plasma midostaurin in AML and ASM, SM-
AHN, MCL patients were 919 and 1 060 ng/ml, respectively. The CGP62221 Cmin, ss in the AML and 
the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population were 1 610 ng/ml and 2 020 ng/ml, respectively. The 
CGP52421, Cmin,ss in the AML and the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL population were 8 630 ng/ml and 
2 860 ng/ml, respectively. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Midostaurin has a tissue distribution of geometric mean of 95.2 l (Vz/F). Midostaurin and its 
metabolites are distributed mainly in plasma rather than red blood cells. In vitro data showed 
midostaurin is more than 98% bound to plasma proteins, such as albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) 
and lipoprotein. 
Biotransformation 
Midostaurin is metabolised by CYP3A4 mainly via oxidative pathways. The major plasma 
components included midostaurin and two major active metabolites, CGP62221 (via O-demethylation) 
and CGP52421 (via hydroxylation), accounting for 27.7±2.7% and 38.0±6.6%, respectively, of the 
total plasma exposure at 96 hours after a single 50 mg dose of midostaurin. 
Elimination 
The median terminal half-lives of midostaurin, CGP62221 and CGP52421 in plasma are 
approximately 20.9, 32.3 and 471 hours. The mean apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) was 2.4-3.1 l/h 
in healthy subjects. In AML and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL patients, population pharmacokinetic 
estimates for clearance of midostaurin at steady state were 5.9 l/h and 4.4 l/h, respectively. The Human 
Mass Balance study results indicated that faecal excretion is the major route of excretion (78% of the 
dose), and mostly as metabolites (73% of the dose), while unchanged midostaurin accounts for 3% of 
the dose. Only 4% of the dose is recovered in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
In general, midostaurin and its metabolites showed no major deviation from dose-proportionality after 
a single dose in the range of 25 mg to 100 mg. However, there was a less than dose-proportional 
increase in exposure after multiple doses within the dose range of 50 mg to 225 mg daily. 
Following multiple oral doses, midostaurin displayed time-dependent pharmacokinetics with an initial 
increase in plasma concentrations during the first week (peak Cmin) followed by a decline with time to 
a steady state after approximately 28 days (2.5-fold decrease). While the exact mechanism for the 
declining concentration of midostaurin is unclear, it is likely due to the auto-induction properties of 
midostaurin and its two active metabolite CGP52421 and CGP62221 on CYP3A4. The 
pharmacokinetics of the CGP62221 metabolite showed a similar trend. However, CGP52421 
concentrations increased up to 2.5-fold for ASM, SM-AHN and MCL and up to 9-fold for AML, 
compared to midostaurin after one month of treatment. 
In vitro evaluation of drug-drug interaction potential 
Based on in vitro data, midostaurin and its active metabolites, CGP52421 and CGP62221, are 
considered inhibitors of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 and inducers of CYP2B6 (induction mediated by 
CAR) and CYP1A2 (induction mediated by AhR). 
In vitro experiments demonstrated that midostaurin, CGP52421 and CPG62221 can potentially inhibit 
BCRP and BSEP. Simulations using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models predicted 
that midostaurin given at a dose of 50 mg or 100 mg twice daily at steady state is unlikely to cause 
clinically relevant inhibition of OATP1B. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses no significant impact of age on the pharmacokinetics 
of midostaurin and its two active metabolites was identified for patients aged between 65 and 85 years. 
In adult patients with ASM, SM-AHN and MCL or AML, no midostaurin dose adjustment is required 
based on age. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric patients 
Rydapt is not recommended to be used in children and adolescents (see section 4.2).  
The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in paediatric patients were explored in a phase I dose escalation 
monotherapy study with 22 patients (12 aged 0-2 years and 10 aged 10-17 years) with AML or 
MLL-rearranged ALL using a population pharmacokinetic approach. The pharmacokinetics of 
midostaurin were less than dose proportional with the doses of 30 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 after single 
and multiple doses. Due to the limited pharmacokinetic data in paediatric patients, no comparison with 
midostaurin pharmacokinetics in adults can be made. 
Gender 
Based on population pharmacokinetic model analyses of the effect of gender on clearance of 
midostaurin and its active metabolites, there was no statistically significant finding and the anticipated 
changes in exposure (<20%) were not deemed to be clinically relevant. No midostaurin dose 
adjustment is required based on gender. 
Race/ethnicity 
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetic profile between Caucasian and Black subjects. Based 
on a phase I study in healthy Japanese volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of midostaurin and its 
metabolites (CGP62221 and CGP52421) are similar compared to those observed in other 
pharmacokinetic studies conducted in Caucasians and Blacks. No midostaurin dose adjustment is 
required based on ethnicity. 
Hepatic impairment 
A dedicated hepatic impairment study assessed the systemic exposure of midostaurin after oral 
administration of 50 mg twice daily for 6 days and a single 50 mg dose on day 7 in subjects with 
baseline mild or moderate (Child-Pugh Class A or B, respectively) and following a single dose 
administration of 50 mg in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) in 
comparison to control subjects with normal hepatic function. The maximum concentration of 
midostaurin was reached between 2 and 3 hours after administration after single or repeated doses for 
all groups. On day 1, the AUC0-12 and Cmax were 8 130 ng*h/ml and 1 206 ng/ml, respectively, for 
healthy subjects. AUC0-12 was decreased by 39% and 36% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment, respectively. On day 7, AUCCtrough (exposure under the curve of Ctrough from day 1 to 
day 7) was 5 410 ng*h/ml in healthy subjects and was decreased by 35% and 20% in subjects with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively. AUCtau was decreased by 28% and 20% on 
day 7, respectively. 
The subjects with severe hepatic impairment had a lower geometric mean Cmax and AUCinf of 
midostaurin compared to the control group (Cmax: 1 360 ng/ml, AUCinf: 30 100 ng.h/ml). Cmax and 
AUCinf of midostaurin decreased on average by 78% and 59% respectively in subjects with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Finally, the long-term data from patients were analysed using a population pharmacokinetic approach. 
No impact of hepatic impairment could be identified in patients with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment in the ASM, SM-AHN, MCL and AML populations. 
Overall, there was no increase in exposure (AUC) to plasma midostaurin and its metabolites 
(CGP62221 and CGP52421) in subjects with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline 
mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Exposure to midostaurin and its active metabolite CGP62221 is 
substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic impairment than that in patients with normal hepatic 
function (see section 4.2). However, there are insufficient efficacy data in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment to suggest a dose adjustment is required. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination is a minor route of elimination for midostaurin. No dedicated renal impairment 
study was conducted for midostaurin. Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted using data 
from clinical studies in patients with AML (n=180) and ASM, SM-AHN and MCL (n=141). Out of the 
321 patients included, 177 patients showed pre-existing mild (n=113), moderate (n=60) or severe 
(n=4) renal impairment (15 ml/min ≤ creatinine clearance [CrCL] <90 ml/min). 144 patients showed 
normal renal function (CrCL >90 ml/min) at baseline. Based on the population pharmacokinetic 
analyses, midostaurin clearance was not significantly impacted by renal impairment and therefore no 
dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Due to dose-limiting toxicity, clinical therapeutic exposure levels could not be reached in animals. All 
animal findings described below were observed at midostaurin exposure significantly lower than 
therapeutic levels. 
Safety pharmacology and single/repeated dose toxicity 
Safety pharmacology studies indicate that midostaurin is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of 
the central nervous system. In vitro, midostaurin did not inhibit hERG channel activity up to the limit 
of solubility of 12 µM. The two major human metabolites GGP52421 and CGP62221 (also tested at 
the limit of solubility) inhibited hERG current with moderate safety margins. In the repeat-dose 
studies in dogs, a decrease in heart rate, prolongation of the P-Q interval, and sporadically occurring 
atrioventricular blocks were seen in individual animals. 
In the repeat-dose studies, target organs for toxicity were the gastrointestinal tract (emesis in dogs and 
monkeys, diarrhoea and mucosal alteration), testes (decreased spermatogenesis), bone marrow 
(hypocellularity) and lymphoid organs (depletion/atrophy). The effect on the bone marrow and 
lymphoid organs was accompanied by haematological changes of decreased white blood cells, 
lymphocytes and erythrocytic parameters. An increase in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) was seen 
consistently in rats, and in dogs and monkeys in long-term studies of ≥3 months duration, without 
histopathological correlates. 
Reproductive toxicity 
In a fertility study in rats, midostaurin was associated with reduced fertility, testicular degeneration 
and atrophy, reduced sperm motility, oligo- and aspermia, increased resorptions, decreased pregnancy 
rate, number of implants and live embryos. 
In embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits, increased numbers of late resorptions, 
reduced foetal weight and reduced skeletal ossification were observed. 
In a pre- and post-natal developmental study, maternal dystocia and reduced litter size, lower pup 
body weights, accelerated complete eye opening and delayed auricular startle ontogeny were noted. 
Juvenile animal studies 
In a toxicity study in juvenile rats, midostaurin was administered from days 7 to 70 postpartum. A 
reduction in body weight, haemorrhage and mixed cell infiltration in the lungs, and 
erythrocytosis/erythrophagocytosis in the mesenteric lymph nodes were seen. There were no effects on 
physical development, sensory function or behavioural function. Mating index, fertility index and 
conception rates were reduced at 0, 5 and 15 mg/kg/day, but not at 2 mg/kg/day. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity 
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity endpoints showed no evidence 
of mutagenic or clastogenic activity. No carcinogenicity studies have been performed. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
ERA studies have shown that midostaurin has the potential to be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic 
to the environment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rydapt is and what it is used for 
What Rydapt is 
Rydapt contains the active substance midostaurin. It belongs to a class of medicines called protein 
kinase inhibitors. 
What Rydapt is used for 
Rydapt is used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in adults who have a defect in a gene called 
FLT3. Acute myeloid leukaemia is a form of cancer of certain white blood cells (called myeloid cells) 
in which the body over-produces an abnormal type of these cells. 
Rydapt is also used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis 
with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL). These are 
disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white blood cell. Symptoms are 
caused when too many mast cells enter organs such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen, and release 
substances such as histamine into the blood. 
How Rydapt works 
Midostaurin blocks the action of some enzymes (kinases) in the abnormal cells and stops their division 
and growth. 
At the start of treatment in AML Rydapt is always used together with chemotherapy (medicines for 
treating cancer). 
If you have any questions about how Rydapt works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Rydapt 
Follow the doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information in this leaflet. 
Do not take Rydapt 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to midostaurin or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
if you are already taking any of the following medicines: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin; 
medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine or phenytoin; 
enzalutamide, a medicine used to treat prostate cancer; 
St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression. 
These medicines must be avoided during treatment with Rydapt. Talk to your doctor if you are 
told that you have to start taking one of them during Rydapt treatment. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Rydapt: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have any infections. 
if you have a heart disorder. 
if you have problems with your lungs or problems breathing. 
if you have problems with your kidneys. 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse straight away if you get any of these symptoms during treatment 
with Rydapt: 
- 
if you have fever, sore throat or mouth ulcers, because these may indicate that your white blood 
cell count is low. 
if you have new or worsening symptoms such as fever, cough with or without mucous, chest 
pain, trouble breathing or shortness of breath, because these may be signs of lung problems. 
if you have or experience chest pain or discomfort, light-headedness, fainting, dizziness, blue 
discolouration of your lips, hands or feet, shortness of breath, or swelling of your lower limbs 
(oedema) or skin, because these may be signs of heart problems. 
- 
- 
Your doctor may need to adjust, temporarily stop or completely discontinue your treatment with 
Rydapt. 
Monitoring during treatment with Rydapt 
Your doctor will perform regular blood tests during treatment with Rydapt in order to monitor the 
amount of blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets) and electrolytes (e.g. calcium, 
potassium, magnesium) in your body. Your heart and lung function will also be checked regularly. 
Children and adolescents 
Rydapt should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age who are also receiving 
other chemotherapy, because it could cause a severe reduction of certain types of blood cells. 
Other medicines and Rydapt 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because Rydapt can affect the way some medicines work. Some other medicines 
can also affect how Rydapt works. 
The following medicines must be avoided during treatment with Rydapt: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
medicines used to treat tuberculosis, such as rifampicin; 
medicines used to treat epilepsy, such as carbamazepine or phenytoin; 
enzalutamide, a medicine used to treat prostate cancer; 
St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum), a herbal medicine used to treat 
depression. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
some medicines used to treat infections, such as ketoconazole or clarithromycin; 
some medicines used to treat HIV, such as ritonavir or efavirenz; 
some medicines used to treat depression, such as nefazodone or bupropion; 
some medicines used to control levels of fat in your blood, such as atorvastatin or rosuvastatin; 
tizanidine, a medicine used to relax muscles; 
chlorzoxazone, a medicine used for treating discomfort caused by muscle spasms. 
If you are taking any of these medicines, your doctor might prescribe a different medicine for you 
during your treatment with Rydapt. 
You should also tell your doctor if you are already taking Rydapt and you are prescribed a new 
medicine that you have not previously taken during treatment with Rydapt. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether your medicine is one of the medicines listed 
above. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Rydapt may harm your unborn baby and is not recommended during pregnancy. If you are pregnant, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking 
this medicine. 
Rydapt could harm your baby. You should not breast-feed during treatment with Rydapt and for at 
least 4 months after stopping the treatment. 
Contraception in women 
If you become pregnant while taking Rydapt, it may harm your baby. Your doctor will ask you to take 
a pregnancy test before you start treatment with Rydapt to make sure you are not pregnant. You must 
use an effective method of contraception while taking Rydapt and for at least 4 months after you have 
stopped taking it. Your doctor will discuss with you the most suitable method of contraception for you 
to use. 
If you become pregnant or think you are pregnant, tell your doctor right away. 
Fertility 
Rydapt may reduce fertility in men and women. You should discuss this with your doctor before 
starting treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Take special care when driving and using machines as you may develop dizziness and vertigo while 
you are taking Rydapt. 
Rydapt contains ethanol anhydrous (alcohol) 
This medicine contains 666 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each 200 mg dose (maximum daily dose) which 
is equivalent to 14 vol. % ethanol anhydrous. The amount in a 200 mg dose of this medicine is 
equivalent to 17 ml beer or 7 ml wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any 
noticeable effects. Alcohol may be harmful if you have alcohol-related problems, epilepsy or liver 
problems, or if you are pregnant or breast-feeding.

The usual daily dose is 50 mg (2 capsules) twice daily. 
Patients with ASM, SM-AHN or MCL

- 
Depending on how you respond to Rydapt, your doctor may lower your dose or temporarily interrupt 
the treatment. 
Taking this medicine 
- 
- 
Taking Rydapt at the same time each day will help you to remember to take your medicine. 
Take Rydapt twice a day at about 12-hour intervals (for example, with breakfast and with your 
evening meal). 
Take Rydapt with food. 
Swallow the capsules whole with a glass of water. Do not open, crush or chew them to ensure 
proper dosing and avoid the unpleasant taste of the capsule content.

follow your doctor’s recommendations. 
If you vomit after you swallow the capsules, do not take any more capsules until your next 
scheduled dose. 
How long to take Rydapt 
- 
Continue taking Rydapt for as long as your doctor tells you. Your doctor will regularly monitor 
your condition to check that the treatment is having the desired effect. 
If you are being treated for AML, after you finish taking Rydapt with chemotherapy medicines, 
you will receive Rydapt alone for up to 12 months. 
If you are being treated for ASM, SM-AHN or MCL, you will receive Rydapt as a long-term 
treatment, possibly lasting for months or years. 
If you have any questions about how long to take Rydapt, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
If you take more Rydapt than you should 
If you take more capsules than you should, or if someone else takes your medicine, talk to a doctor or 
go to a hospital straight away, taking the pack with you, as medical treatment may be necessary. 
If you forget to take Rydapt 
If you forget to take Rydapt, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Do not 
take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Instead, wait until it is time for your next dose. 
If you stop taking Rydapt 
Stopping your treatment with Rydapt may cause your condition to become worse. Do not stop taking 
your medicine unless your doctor tells you to do so. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

On 18 May 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Renvela. 
The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Genzyme Europe BV. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication as follows: 
“Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 years of 
age and a body surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease.” 
For information, the full indications for Renvela will be as follows:2 
“Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients receiving 
haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.  
Renvela is also indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in adult patients with chronic 
kidney disease not on dialysis with serum phosphorus > 1.78 mmol/L.  
Renvela is indicated for the control of hyperphosphataemia in paediatric patients (>6 
years of age and a body surface area (BSA) of >0.75 m2) with chronic kidney disease. 
Renvela should be used within the context of a multiple therapeutic approach, which could include 
calcium supplement, 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D 3 or one of its analogues to control the 
development of renal bone disease.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report

the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

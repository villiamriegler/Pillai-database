Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for degarelix, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
8 cases of rhabdomyolysis have cumulativly been reported with degarelix. In 4 of the 8 cases, the causal 
relationship between degarelix and the event could not be ruled out; the cases were well documented, 
without evident alternative aetiology or confounding factors, with compatible time-to-onset and positive 
dechallenge and increased blood CPK. In each case degarelix was discontinued. In conclusion, 
rhabdomyolysis should be added to the list of ADRs of the Product Information with a frequency rare. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for degarelix the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing degarelix is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Summary of risk management plan for Tracleer®/ 
STAYVEER® (bosentan)  
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Tracleer/STAYVEER.  The 
RMP details important risks of Tracleer/STAYVEER, how these risks can be minimised, 
and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Tracleer/STAYVEER’s  risks  and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
Tracleer/STAYVEER’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package 
leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on  how 
Tracleer/STAYVEER should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Tracleer/STAYVEER should be read in the context of all 
this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Tracleer/STAYVEER’s RMP. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
I 
Tracleer/STAYVEER  is  authorised  for  treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
(PAH) to improve exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with WHO functional class 
III  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  new  digital  ulcers  (DU)  in  patients  with  systemic 
sclerosis and ongoing digital ulcer disease (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
bosentan as the active substance and it is given by oral route twice a day. 
Further information about the evaluation of Tracleer/STAYVEER’s benefits can be found 
in Tracleer/STAYVEER’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on

II  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Tracleer/STAYVEER, together with measures to minimise such risks 
and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Tracleer/STAYVEER’s  risks,  are 
outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
• 
The  authorised  pack  size  —  the  amount  of  medicine  in  a  pack  is  chosen  so  to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Tracleer/STAYVEER,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional 
risk  minimisation  measures  mentioned  under  relevant  important  risks  in  Section II.B 
below. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that  immediate 
action  can  be  taken as necessary. These measures constitute  routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Tracleer/STAYVEER is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ in Section II.A below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Tracleer/STAYVEER  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management 
activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are 
the  use  of 
concerns 
Tracleer/STAYVEER. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use 
of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected 
(e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Bosentan, like other medicines of the same chemical class, 
may affect the liver.  
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
The mechanism of this adverse event is unclear. 
Interruption or stopping treatment may be necessary. 
Liver dysfunction risk may be increased when medicinal 
products that are inhibitors of the bile salt export pump 
(BSEP), e.g., rifampicin, glibenclamide and cyclosporine A 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.5 of SmPC), are co-administered 
with bosentan, but limited data are available. 
Bosentan is contraindicated in patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment. 
A causal relationship to bosentan or a superimposed 
contribution of the drug to the progression or worsening of 
severe liver complications in some patients with pre 
existing liver disease or progressive hepatic co morbidity in 
PAH or connective tissue disease is difficult to 
establish/assess due to the complexity of the cases and 
presence of multiple confounding factors. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8, patient information 
leaflet (PIL) section 2 and 4, Legal status 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Controlled distribution system, Healthcare Professional and 
Patient education material (SmPC, Patient information 
leaflet and Patient Alert Card) 
 
 
 
Important identified risk: Teratogenicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
According to results from animal studies, bosentan and 
medicines of the same chemical class may harm unborn 
babies conceived before starting or during treatment. Based 
on a limited number of pregnancies observed in women 
exposed to bosentan, no translation of this risk to humans 
has been observed. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
All women of childbearing potential on bosentan therapy 
who are not using a reliable method of contraception. 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk mimimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, PIL section 2, Legal 
status 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Controlled distribution system, Healthcare Professional and 
Patient education material (SmPC, Patient information 
leaflet and Patient Alert Card) 
Important identified risk: Decrease in haemoglobin concentration 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In clinical trials, bosentan therapy is associated with a 
decrease in haemoglobin concentration, thought to be due 
to fluid shift. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
General risk factors for anaemia are, e.g., iron-deficiency, 
history of anaemia, concomitant use of platelet inhibitors, 
anticoagulants, steroids, pre-existing or concurrent 
bleeding. 
Routine risk mimimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8, PIL section 2 and 4, Legal status 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Controlled distribution system, Healthcare Professional and 
Patient education material (SmPC and Patient information 
leaflet) 
 
 
 
 
Important identified risk: Decrease of sperm count 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In a study investigating the effects of bosentan on testicular 
function in male PAH patients, 8 out of 24 patients showed 
a decreased sperm concentration from baseline of at least 
42% after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan (see 
SmPC). Based on these findings and preclinical data, it 
cannot be excluded that bosentan may have a detrimental 
effect on spermatogenesis in men. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Male patients. 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Routine risk mimimisation measures: 
SmPC section 4.6, PIL section 2, Legal status 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Controlled distribution system, Healthcare Professional 
education material (SmPC) 
Important potential risk: Pulmonary oedema associated with PVOD 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Cases of pulmonary oedema have been reported with 
vasodilators (mainly prostacyclins) when used in patients 
with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Consequently, 
should signs of pulmonary oedema occur when bosentan is 
administered in patients with PAH, the possibility of 
associated veno-occlusive disease should be considered. In 
the post-marketing period there have been rare reports of 
pulmonary oedema in patients treated with bosentan who 
had a suspected diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive 
disease. 
Patients with PVOD treated with bosentan. 
 
 
 
 
Risk minimisation 
measures

Additional risk minimisation measures: 
Controlled distribution system 
Important potential risk: Interactions with substrates, inducers or inhibitors of 
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (including hormonal 
contraceptives, sildenafil and antiretrovirals) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Bosentan is metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. 
Inhibition of these isoenzymes may increase the plasma 
concentration of bosentan. The influence of CYP2C9 
inhibitors on bosentan concentration has not been studied. 
The combination should be used with caution.  
Co-administration with substances metabolised by 
isoenzymes CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, including hormonal 
contraceptives, sildenafil and antiretrovirals.

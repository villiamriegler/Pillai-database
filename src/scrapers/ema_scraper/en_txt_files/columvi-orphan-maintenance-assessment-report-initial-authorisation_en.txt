2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in designation in 2021 
was based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing glofitamab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data from patients with relapsed and refractory 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who respond to treatment with glofitamab;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to involvement of single or multiple nodal 
or extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and bone marrow and life-threatening in 
patients not responding to first-line treatment;    
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.   
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled.  
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing glofitamab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided preliminary clinical data in patients affected by the condition who had relapsed or did not 
respond to at least two prior systemic treatments. These patients showed clinically relevant responses 
when treated with the product. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant 
advantage.  
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled.  
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are cumulatively fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends 
the designation of this medicinal product, containing glofitamab as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan condition: treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.” 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma histologically characterised 
by dense proliferation of neoplastic B-cells. It represents the most common histological subtype of 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), the 10th most common cancer in the European Union (EU), and one 
of the major causes of cancer-related deaths, despite advances in therapy (ECIS, 2020). DLBCL 
accounts for 25% to 45% of all NHL cases worldwide (Wild et al, 2020), and although it can occur at 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000091986 
Page 4/34 
 
 
 
 
 
any age, it typically affects older individuals (median age at presentation is >65 years), and it is 
slightly more frequent in males (Mounier et al, 2015).  
In recognition of the unique clinical and pathological features of DLBCL subtypes and associated 
therapeutic implications, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated the previous 2008 
classification of lymphoid neoplasms in 2016 and also recently in 2022 to further refine the current 
understanding of mature B-cell neoplasms reflected in the recognition of 12 families of diseases under 
this category (Swerdlow et al., 2016; Alaggio et al. 2022). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Columvi as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), after two or more lines of 
systemic therapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat 
The medical plausibility is confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The sponsor briefly outlines the chronically debilitating and life-threatening nature of the disease and 
refers to it as having an aggressive natural history, with a median survival of less than one year if left 
untreated (Koff, 2017). The clinical course of DLBCL can be debilitating due to constitutional 
symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy and bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, 
anaemia, and thrombocytopenia.  
The sponsor has not identified any significant changes in the seriousness of DLBCL since the orphan 
designation was granted in 2021. The COMP agreed that the condition remains chronically debilitating 
due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease 
involvement, and bone marrow failure that may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia, 
and life-threatening in patients with relapsed/refractory disease who do not respond to treatment.  
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor proposed a prevalence of 4.28 per 10,000 persons. 
The sponsor has identified additional and updated sources as compared to the orphan designation 
application in 2021. Estimates were updated for NORDCAN, IKNL (The Netherlands), Slovenian Cancer 
Registry, and Germany. Additionally, new sources of estimates from Spain (REDECAN) and Belgium 
were identified. The average complete/lifetime prevalence (population-weighted using data from 
Slovenia, Italy, Germany, and Spain) was estimated to be 7.54 [min−max: 4.93 to 7.73]. To reflect 
patients who would be considered in the non-cured pool (i.e. due to diagnosis, treatment as new case 
or relapsed, and various modes of monitoring) the sponsor proposes to use a 10-year limited duration 
estimate. An updated 10-year limited-duration prevalence that was population-weighted and is based 
on population-based registry data (using data from NORDCAN, The Netherlands, Slovenia, Germany, 
Belgium) is estimated at 4.28 per 10,000. For the sensitivity analysis, an updated modelled prevalence 
(incidence-based cohort model years 2012 to 2021) of the noncured DLBCL pool yielded a prevalence 
of 4.81 per 10,000.

I The EU27 estimate for the year 2022 is based on the latest observed data. Each prevalence estimate for the EU27 
is an average based on population-based registry data available. 
The COMP agreed with the sponsor’s proposal and concluded that the prevalence is 4.3 in 10,000 
persons in the European community based on most recent publications and updated registries.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The sponsor referred to the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines 
for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for DLBCL, which describe some of the treatment strategies 
available to these patients in the first- and second line setting (Tilly et al., 2015). They recognised that 
the treatment landscape has evolved since the ESMO guidelines became publicly available, as new 
medicinal products such as the three approved CAR-T-cell therapies tisagenlecleucel (hereinafter 
referred to as tisa-cel; Kymriah), axicabtagene ciloleucel (hereinafter referred to as axi-cel; Yescarta), 
and lisocabtagene maraleucel (hereinafter referred to as liso-cel; Breyanzi), polatuzumab vedotin 
(Polivy), tafasitamab (Minjuvi), and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) have been authorised in the EU 
after 2015. These products are therefore not included in the current ESMO guidelines. 
R-CHOP given in 21-day intervals remains the standard of care therapy for patients with previously 
untreated DLBCL, although Polivy+R-CHP was recently approved in the EU as first-line therapy after 
showing meaningful benefit over R-CHOP in a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial (Polivy MA extension: 
24/05/2022, Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004870/II/0012).  
The sponsor provided a detailed table outlining all existing methods for the treatment of patients with 
DLBCL in the European community, and centrally as well as nationally approved products.

Lymphomas (NHL). The benefit of

established in patients when used as 
fifth line or greater chemotherapy in 
patients who are refractory to last 
therapy. 
Proposed therapeutic indication for glofitamab: Glofitamab as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with r/r DLBCL, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
Very recently, in December 2022, loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) was conditionally approved as 
“monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) DLBCL 
and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL), after two or more lines of systemic therapy”. This therapeutic 
indication overlaps with the one intended for glofitamab and Zynlonta is therefore considered a 
satisfactory method for the target patient population of glofitamab for the purpose of orphan 
designation. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000091986 
Page 9/34 
 
 
 
 
 
Pixuvri (pixantrone) is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with multiply r/r 
aggressive NHL. The benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used 
as fifth line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy. Although 
glofitamab is to be used in r/r DLBCL, the therapeutic indications are not considered to be completely 
overlapping since glofitamab is intended to be used in the third and later lines while Pixuvri is limited 
to third and fourth lines. 
Polivy (polatuzumab vedotinin) in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 
prednisone (R-CHP) is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated DLBCL, 
and in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL 
who are not candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). As Polivy should be used only 
in r/r DLBCL patients who are not candidates for HSCT, the therapeutic indications of Polivy and 
glofitamab are not considered to be completely overlapping.  
Minjuvi (tafasitamab) is indicated in combination with lenalidomide followed by Minjuvi monotherapy 
for the treatment of adult patients with r/r DLBCL who are not eligible for ASCT. As Minjuvi should be 
used only in r/r DLBCL patients who are not candidates for HSCT, the therapeutic indications of Minjuvi 
and glofitamab are not considered to be completely overlapping.  
Therefore, Pixuvri, Polivy and Minjuvi are not considered satisfactory methods for the entire patient 
population covered by the proposed indication for glofitamab and will not be discussed under the 
significant benefit section. 
In conclusion, the approved CAR-T cell products in the third- and later lines setting, specifically 
Yescarta, Kymriah, and Breyanzi, as well as Zynlonta are considered satisfactory methods of treatment 
relevant for a discussion on the significant benefit for glofitamab and will be further discussed below. 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor did not seek any protocol assistance from EMA to agree on the approach for collecting the 
evidence needed for the justification of significant benefit of glofitamab over existing methods of 
treatment for patients with r/r DLBCL who have received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. 
The sponsor argued that glofitamab is of significant benefit over the CAR-T cell therapies based on a 
clinically relevant advantage in terms of improved efficacy and a better safety profile in comparison to 
the approved CAR-T cell products and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) for r/r DLBCL patients in the 
third- and later lines setting. It was also claimed that glofitamab provides a clinically relevant 
advantage to patients who have failed prior treatment with several CAR-T cell products, and a major 
contribution to patient care based on immediate availability for treatment planning and less restrictions 
on daily living after treatment. Each claim will be discussed separately below. 
The sponsor presented data from an expanded efficacy population from study NP30179, which is an 
ongoing multicenter, multicohort, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion first-in-human 
(FIH), single-arm phase 1/2 study used to obtain the pivotal evidence for glofitamab in patients with 
r/r DLBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy in the conditional MA application. The study was 
designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of glofitamab administered 
by intravenous (IV) infusion as a single agent and in combination with obinutuzumab following pre-
treatment with a fixed dose of 1000 mg obinutuzumab (Gazyvaro) in patients with r/r NHL. The 
expanded efficacy population included 149 patients with r/r DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS; 
n=110 [74%]), transformed follicular lymphoma (trFL; n=29 [20%]), and HGBCL (n=10 [7%]) who 
had received at least two prior lines and were treated with glofitamab step-up dosing of 2.5/10/30 mg 
pooled from the cohorts D2[Sub. 2], D3, and D5. The sponsor argued that this pooled efficacy 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 10/34 
 
 
 
 
 
population aligns more closely with the primary safety population (N=154, including patients with 
primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma [PMBCL]). The data cut-off (DCO) date for the efficacy and safety 
analyses provided was 15-Jun-2022. 
The primary efficacy objective of the phase 2 part is to evaluate the antitumor activity of glofitamab as 
a single agent following obinutuzumab in patients diagnosed with DLBCL as measured by independent 
review committee (IRC) assessed complete response (CR) rate according to the Lugano classification 
criteria (Cheson et al., 2014). Secondary efficacy outcome measures included IRC-assessed overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of complete response (DOCR), duration of response (DOR), time to first 
complete response (TFCR), time to first overall response (TFOR), and progression-free survival (PFS). 
The median number of prior cancer therapies in the pooled population was 3 (range: 2−7). Overall, 
60% of the patients had received 3 or more prior lines of systemic therapy. All patients had received 
prior chemotherapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal therapy, and alkylator therapy, and 33% (49/149) of the 
patients had received prior CAR-T cell therapy. The median time from last prior therapy to start of 
study treatment was 2.7 months. The majority of patients (89%) were refractory to any prior therapy, 
with 58% refractory to first-line therapy and 84% refractory to their last prior therapy. Overall, 83% of 
the patients were refractory to any prior anti-CD20 therapy. The majority of patients who received 
prior CAR-T cell therapy were refractory to it (44/49 [90%]). 
Key results in the efficacy populations are summarized in Table 4. Median duration of follow-up at the

Significant benefit of glofitamab versus the approved CAR-T cell products 
Comparable efficacy in a more heavily pre-treated population: 
The sponsor starts out by descriptively comparing the results of the pivotal studies for the CAR-T cell 
products and glofitamab (Table 4). The sponsor considers that the patient population in study NP30179 
represents a harder to treat population than those included in the pivotal studies for the approved 
CAR- T cell products: 
• 
• 
• 
Patients receiving glofitamab were slightly older (median age 66 years) than patients enrolled to 
receive Yescarta, Kymriah, and Breyanzi in the pivotal studies (median age 58-62 years). 
Patients in study NP30179 were more heavily pre-treated as the pivotal CAR-T cell studies included 
patients pre-treated with 1 or more prior lines of therapy. 
Patients in glofitamab study NP30179 were more refractory to their prior therapies than those 
included in the pivotal studies for Yescarta and Kymriah. 
•  A substantial proportion (33%; 49/149) of patients receiving glofitamab had received CAR-T cell 
therapy in a prior line. The majority (36/49 patients [73%]) received CAR-T cell therapy in the 
most recent line, and the majority (44/49 patients [90%]) were refractory. 
The sponsor claimed that the response rates and durations of response observed with glofitamab are 
broadly comparable to those reported for the approved CAR-T cell products, despite being studied in a 
more difficult to treat patient population (Table 5). In particular, the IRC-assessed CR rate of 40% 
(95% CI: 32, 48) for glofitamab in the pooled efficacy population (excluding patients with PMBCL) is in 
the same range as those reported for the intent-to-treat (ITT) populations of the CAR-T cell therapies 
(CRR: 28-47%).

The COMP agreed with the sponsor that the patient population included in the expanded efficacy 
population from study NP30179 is older that those included in the pivotal studies for the CAR-T cell 
therapies, but whether this might have any impact on the efficacy results has not been established. In 
addition, the patients who received liso-cel in its pivotal study appear to be comparable in terms of 
refractoriness to those treated with glofitamab. Nevertheless, around one third of the patients treated 
with glofitamab had already received and progressed after prior CAR-T cell therapy. The response rates 
observed with glofitamab in this subset (ORR 49%; CRR 35%) are consistent with those observed in 
the main efficacy population and show that patients who had failed prior CAR-T cell therapy responded 
to subsequent treatment with glofitamab. 
Significant benefit of glofitamab in patients with r/r DLBCL will be further discussed separately for each 
of the CAR-T cell therapies.  
Improved safety: 
The sponsor summarised the main safety findings with glofitamab compared with the CAR-T cell 
therapies. The sponsor claimed that glofitamab has a more favourable safety profile compared with the 
approved CAR-T cell therapies, with a lower frequency of severe (Grade ≥ 3) adverse events (AEs). In 
particular, when comparing overlapping toxicities, the frequency of Grade ≥ 3 CRS with glofitamab was 
lower or comparable to those reported for the CAR-T cell therapies, and the frequencies of Grade ≥ 3 
neurological AEs and Grade ≥ 3 haematological toxicities (neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and

The COMP considered that the claim of improved safety based on the frequencies of overlapping 
toxicities does not reflect the whole picture, and that biases due to differences in patient characteristic 
cannot be excluded. Moreover, a comparable proportion of patients experienced serious AEs across the 
pivotal studies. Given the limited experience with glofitamab thus far from a small single-arm study 
with limited follow-up, the claim of better safety in comparison to the approved CAR-T cell therapies 
cannot be concluded on at present stage and no adequate quantification is possible for the descriptive 
cross-study comparisons presented.

Major contribution to patient care 
The sponsor argued that patients who require rapid disease control of their aggressive lymphoma are 
unlikely to be suitable candidates for CAR-T cell therapy because of significant waiting times before 
start treatment. For patients with suitable disease kinetics, failure of CAR-T cell manufacturing and 
access to a specialized center are additional barriers they may face. According to the sponsor, 
glofitamab offers a significant benefit to patients with r/r DLBCL by being readily available when 
needed and providing rapid disease control and durable responses. 
The COMP acknowledged the sponsors’ argument that treatment with glofitamab requires no bridging- 
or pre-treatment therapy and can be used in all centres specialised in treating oncology patients 
without delays to patients suffering from a highly aggressive disease. However, it should be recalled 
that a product's claim of major contribution to patient care may not be established in the absence of 
the demonstration of the product’s equivalence in terms of efficacy, safety, and benefit/risk balance 
with the relevant authorised medicinal products. Reference is made, in this respect, to the 2016 
“Commission notice on the application of Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan 
medicinal products” (available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:JOC_2016_424_R_0003&from=EN). 
Moreover, efficacy data for glofitamab from the subset of patients in the pivotal study who would be 
considered ineligible for the three approved CAR-T cell therapies, may be relevant for the COMP to 
evaluate such a claim. 
Significant benefit of glofitamab versus Kymriah: 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit of glofitamab versus Kymriah based on improved efficacy. 
When comparing the efficacy results for the ITT populations excluding patients with PMBCL (N=149 for 
glofitamab vs. N=167 enrolled/leukepheresed for Kymriah), glofitamab demonstrated improved 
efficacy over Kymriah based on higher response rates: 
• 
The ORR and CRR for glofitamab (ORR 51%; CRR 40%) were both higher than those reported for 
Kymriah (ORR 37%; CRR 28%). 
•  With median follow-up for 13.4 months, median DOR for glofitamab was 16.8 months at the latest 
DCO and is likely to increase with longer follow-up. Median DOR for Kymriah was not reached at 
the latest DCO of its pivotal study (median follow-up 7.7 months; range: 0.4-50.0). 
•  Median DOCR was not reached for glofitamab at the latest DCO, at which time 76% of CRs in the 
pooled efficacy population were still ongoing. Median DOCR was also not reached for Kymriah at 
the latest DCO of its pivotal study (Table 5). 
As already noted, patients receiving glofitamab in study NP30179 were older than those enrolled to 
receive Kymriah in the pivotal study JULIET (median age: 66.5 years vs. 58 years). Patients in the 
expanded efficacy population from study NP30179 were also more heavily pre-treated as all had 
received at least 2 prior lines of therapy (range: 2-7), whereas the JULIET study included patients with 
1 or more prior lines (range: 1-6). Moreover, more patients treated with glofitamab were refractory to 
their prior therapies (Table 4). As such, patients in study NP30179 may represent a harder to treat 
population than the patient population of the pivotal study for Kymriah. 
The sponsor also claimed significant benefit of glofitamab over Kymriah based on improved safety. 
Glofitamab had lower frequencies of Grade ≥ 3 (4% vs. 23%), Grade ≥ 3 neurological AEs (2% vs. 
19%), and hematological toxicities including neutropenia (any grade: 38% vs. 97%; Grade ≥ 3: 27% 
vs. 82%), febrile neutropenia (3% vs. 17%), and thrombocytopenia (Grade ≥ 3: 8% vs. 39%; Table 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

7). The COMP considered that given the limited experience with glofitamab thus far, the claim of better 
safety in comparison to Kymriah cannot be concluded on at present stage and no adequate 
quantification is possible in the proposed indirect comparison.  
Significant benefit of glofitamab versus Yescarta: 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit of glofitamab versus Yescarta based on broadly on improved 
efficacy with comparable CRR and more durable responses in a harder to treat population. Patients 
receiving glofitamab in study NP30179 were older than those enrolled to receive Yescarta in the pivotal 
study ZUMA-1 (median age: 66.5 years vs. 58 years). Patients in the expanded efficacy population 
from study NP30179 were also more heavily pre-treated as all had received at least 2 prior lines of 
therapy (range: 2-7), whereas ZUMA-1 included patients with 1 or more prior lines (range: 1-10). 
Moreover, more patients treated with glofitamab were refractory to their prior therapies (Table 5).  
According to the sponsor when comparing the efficacy results for the ITT populations (N=149 for 
glofitamab excluding patients with PMBCL vs. N=111 enrolled/leukapheresed for Yescarta including 
patients with PMBCL), glofitamab demonstrated broadly comparable CRRs and more durable responses 
per IRC assessment as compared to Yescarta: 
• 
IRC-assessed ORR for glofitamab (51%) was lower than the ORR for Yescarta (66%), however, the 
CR rates are considered to be broadly comparable (40% vs. 47%, respectively) considering the 
larger proportion of patients with refractory disease in study NP30179. 
•  Median DOR for glofitamab of 16.8 months was longer than the median DOR of 14 months 
reported for Yescarta at the 12-month analysis of its pivotal study (median follow-up of 15.1 
month). 
•  Median DOCR was not reached for glofitamab at the latest DCO (median follow-up 13.4 months), 
at which time 76% of CRs in the pooled efficacy population were still ongoing. Median DOCR was 
also not reached for Yescarta at the at the 12-month analysis of its pivotal study (Table 5). 
In an updated analysis from the Yescarta ZUMA-1 trial with a median follow-up of 27 months (Locke et 
al. 2019), the median DOR per investigator assessment was reported to be 11.1 months (95% CI: 4.2, 
NE) and median INV-DOCR was still not reached (95% CI: 12.9, NE); 39/84 patients (46%) had 
ongoing responses at the data cut-off including 37/59 patients (63%) with ongoing complete 
responses. In the glofitamab study NP30179, a supporting cohort of 97 patients with DLBCL NOS, trFL 
and HGBCL treated with glofitamab ≥  10 mg doses had been followed for a similar length of time (26 
months) and showed highly durable responses (Table 4): at the 15 June 2022 CCOD, median DOR in 
this supporting cohort was 25 months (95% CI: 9.4, NE) for IRC-DOR and median DOCR had still not 
been reached (95% CI: 17.9, NE), with 63% of complete responders (per IRC) still in remission. These 
data support that glofitamab achieves equally durable complete responses as Yescarta in 3L+ r/r 
DLBCL in the view of the sponsor.  
Furthermore, the sponsor discusses that from a safety perspective, when comparing overlapping 
toxicities, glofitamab has a more favourable safety profile than Yescarta, with lower frequencies of 
Grade ≥ 3 CRS (4% vs. 11%), Grade ≥ 3 neurological AEs (2% vs. 31%), and haematological toxicities 
including neutropenia (Grade ≥ 3: 27% vs. 93%), febrile neutropenia (3% vs. 31%), and 
thrombocytopenia (Grade ≥ 3: 8% vs. 40%; Table 7). The same arguments as were described earlier 
in the report for a major contribution to patient care as compared with Yescarta was also put forward. 
Regarding the claim on improved efficacy the COMP considered that the significant benefit of 
glofitamab over Yescarta is not considered established, based on the data presented. The median DOR 
for glofitamab of 16.8 months was longer than the median DOR of 14.0 months reported for Yescarta 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

at the 12-month analysis of its pivotal study (median follow-up of 15.1 month). However, the median 
DOR was not reached for Yescarta at the additional 24-month analysis with a median follow-up of 27.1 
months and the ORR for glofitamab was also lower than that reported for Yescarta (51% vs. 66%). 
The COMP considered that the claim of better safety and the arguments for a major contribution to 
patient care compared to Yescarta are not considered established based on the data provided. 
In conclusion, the COMP considered that the sponsor should provide a more detailed overview of the 
baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in the comparator study ZUMA-1 versus the 
pivotal study NP30179 for glofitamab. Finally, the sponsor should submit a matching-adjusted indirect 
comparison of the efficacy outcomes between patients treated with Yescarta in ZUMA-1 versus patients 
treated with glofitamab in NP30179. 
Significant benefit versus Breyanzi: 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit of glofitamab versus Breyanzi based on comparable efficacy 
and improved safety. Patients receiving glofitamab in study NP30179 were older than those enrolled to 
receive Breyanzi in the pivotal study TRANSCEND (median age: 66.5 years vs. 62 years). Patients in 
the expanded efficacy population from study NP30179 were also more heavily pre-treated as all had 
received at least 2 prior lines of therapy (range: 2-7), whereas the TRANSCEND study included 
patients with 1 or more prior lines (range: 1-12). Slightly more patients treated with glofitamab were 
refractory to prior therapies (Table 5).  
According to the sponsor, when comparing the efficacy results for the ITT populations (N=149 for 
glofitamab excluding patients with PMBCL vs. N=298 enrolled/leukepheresed for Breyanzi including 
patients with PMBCL), glofitamab demonstrated comparable efficacy to Breyanzi based on similar CRRs 
and durability of responses: 
• 
IRC-assessed ORR for glofitamab (51%) was lower than the ORR for Breyanzi (60%), however, the 
CR rates were similar (40% vs. 43%, respectively) considering the more refractory patient 
population in study NP30179. 
•  Median duration of response for glofitamab of 16.8 months was identical to that reported for 
Breyanzi at the at the latest DCO of its pivotal study (16.8 months). 
•  Median DOCR was not reached for glofitamab at the latest DCO (median follow-up 13.4 months), 
at which time 76% of CRs in the pooled efficacy population were still ongoing. Median DOCR was 
26.1 months for Breyanzi at the latest DCO of its pivotal study (median follow-up 19.9 months 
[range: 0.2-45]; Table 5), and 63% of complete responders were in remission for at least 12 
months.  
In the supporting cohort of 97 patients with DLBCL NOS, trFL and HGBCL treated with glofitamab ≥ 10 
mg doses and followed for 26 months (Table 4), median DOR was 25 months (95% CI: 9.4, NE) and 
median DOCR had not been reached (95% CI: 17.9, NE), with 63% of complete responders still in 
remission at the CCOD (15 June 2022).  
From a safety perspective, when comparing overlapping toxicities, the sponsor claims that glofitamab 
has a more favorable safety profile than Breyanzi, with similar frequency of Grade ≥ 3 CRS (4%), but 
lower frequencies of Grade ≥ 3 neurological AEs (2% vs. 12%) and hematological toxicities including 
neutropenia (Grade ≥ 3: 27% vs. 76%), febrile neutropenia (3% vs. 9%), and thrombocytopenia 
(Grade ≥ 3: 8% vs. 39%; Table 7). The same arguments as were described earlier in the report for a 
MCPC as compared with Breyanzi was also put forward.

The COMP agreed with the sponsor that the efficacy of glofitamab appears comparable based on the 
descriptive cross-study comparisons. However, since there is no data on patients pretreated with 
Breyanzi the significant benefit cannot only be justified based on similar efficacy. The COMP considered 
that the claim of better safety and the arguments for a major contribution to patient care compared to 
Breyanzi are not considered established based on the data provided. 
In conclusion, the COMP considered that the sponsor should provide a more detailed overview of the 
baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in the comparator studies TRANSCEND 
versus the pivotal study NP30179 for glofitamab. In addition, the sponsor should submit a matching-
adjusted indirect comparisons of the efficacy outcomes between patients treated with Breyanzi in 
TRANSCEND versus patients treated with glofitamab in NP30179. 
Significant benefit based on efficacy in patients pre-treated with CAR-T cell therapy 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit of glofitamab over tisa-cel and axi-cel based on the efficacy 
observed in patients who had failed (relapsed after/refractory to) prior treatment with these two CD19-
directed CAR-T cell products, which represents a patient population at risk for poor clinical outcome.  
Around one third of the patients (33%; 49/149) in the expanded efficacy population from study 
NP30179 had previously received CAR-T cell therapy at the latest DCO. Among these, 28 patients 
received tisa-cel and 13 patients received axi-cel as prior therapy, whereas 8 patients received a CAR-
T cell therapy that was not further specified. Of note, none of the patients were reported to have 
received liso-cel (Breyanzi) possible due to its later approval in the EU (MA: 04/04/2022) compared to 
Yescarta and Kymriah and the timing relative to enrolment in study NP30179. However, there may be 
patients who were treated with liso-cel as investigational medicinal product in clinical trials which were 
captured under ‘other’ CAR-T cell products.  
The ORR for the patients who received prior CAR-T cell therapy in the pooled efficacy population was 
49% (24/19; 95% CI: 34, 64), consistent with the ORR reported for the overall population (51%; 95% 
CI: 43, 59). The median DOR among the responders was 14.4 months (95% CI: 6.7, NE). Glofitamab 
achieved a clinically relevant CR rate of 35% (17/49; 95% CI: 22, 50) in patients who received prior 
CAR-T cell therapy in the pooled efficacy population, also consistent with the results in the overall 
population (40%; 95% CI: 32, 48). The median duration of follow-up for DOCR with glofitamab at the 
latest DCO for the subset of patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy was 7.2 months. Of the 17 patients 
who achieved an IRC-assessed CR with glofitamab, 13 patients (76.5%) remained in CR at the DCO. 
The median DOCR was 14.4 months (95% CI: 8.6, NE). According to the sponsor, the response rates 
reported for this subset support a significant benefit of glofitamab when compared with other therapies 
used after at least two prior lines of therapy in the post-CAR T-cell setting.  
The sponsor further highlighted that when looking at glofitamab response rates by the specific prior 
CAR-T cell therapy received (Kymriah, Yescarta, or “other”; Table 4), the observed ORRs of 38-54% 
and CRRs of 25-46% were consistent with the results for the overall post-CAR T-cell subset in the 
pooled efficacy population. Patients previously treated with axi-cel achieved the highest response rates 
with glofitamab compared with those treated with prior tisa-cel or with other CAR-T cell therapies.

Lugano classification (Cheson et al. 2014)  
Among patients who had received prior treatment with tisa-cel, median DOR was 8.6 months (95% CI: 
2.3, NE) and median DOCR was 14.4 months (95% CI: 8.6, NE). Owing to a small sample sizes and 
limited follow-up in those patients who had received prior treatment with axi-cel and prior ‘other’ 
groups, an analysis of median DOR/DOCR was not possible.  
The efficacy analysis in the subset of patients with prior CAR-T cell therapy in the pooled efficacy 
population of study NP30179 showed that glofitamab offered benefit for patients who have already 
been treated with Kymriah and Yescarta as those who had progressed following treatment with one of 
these two products achieved an ORR of 50-54% and a CR rate of 32-46%. The sponsor did not report 
the durability of the responses observed among the responders previously treated with Yescarta 
because of limited follow-up in a small sample size. Although the responses observed could be 
considered to constitute a clinically relevant advantage for patients with r/r DLBCL in the third- and 
later lines setting, the numbers of patients exposed to and whose disease was refractory to especially 
Yescarta prior to enrolment in the study was rather limited and the data immature. In addition, there 
was no efficacy data reported for patients who were pre-treated with Breyanzi. The sponsor argued 
that 8 of the patients pre-treated with CAR-T cell therapies recorded as “other” prior CAR-T cells might 
include patients pre-treated with Breyanzi.  
Based on the above, the COMP considered that the efficacy in the Kymriah pre-treated patients is 
considered clinically relevant. However, the sponsor should provide an updated sub-analysis of all 
efficacy parameters measured and available to date for patients previously receiving CAR-T cell 
therapy. 
Significant benefit versus Zynlonta 
The sponsor claimed that the patient population of study NP30179 was more refractory and included a 
greater proportion of patients who had received prior CAR-T cell therapy compared with the study 
population of LOTIS-2 which formed the basis of the MA for Zynlonta (Table 11) and is therefore 
considered a harder to treat population than the study population for Zynlonta. Note, the results 
reported for Zynlonta include patients with DLBCL and PMBCL; as such, results for the MA populations 
for study NP30179 are also presented in the Table 5. 
The sponsor claimed significant benefit of glofitamab over loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) based on improved 
efficacy in terms of a higher rate of CRs and more durable response, with a fixed treatment duration of 
12 cycles (8.3 months) and without the need for prolonged treatment (up to 1 year in the pivotal study 
LOTIS-2) or treatment until progression per the approved treatment paradigm (Zynlonta SmPC). The 
ORR for glofitamab in the pooled efficacy population of study NP30179, excluding patients with PMBCL, was 
similar to the ORR reported for Zynlonta (51% vs. 48%). Glofitamab achieved a higher CR rate 
compared with Zynlonta (40% vs. 25%). The median DOR for glofitamab was longer than that reported for 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Zynlonta (16.8 months vs. 13.4 months). The median DOCR was not reached for glofitamab and Zynlonta at 
the latest DCOs. However, glofitamab appears to achieve more durable CR. The majority of patients who 
achieved a CR with glofitamab (76%; 45/59) remained in CR at the latest DCO of its pivotal study (median 
follow-up 7.7 months), compared with 44% (16/36) in the LOTIS-2 study for Zynlonta after a median 
follow-up of 8 months (Kahl et al. 2021). Furthermore, in the subset of patients who had received prior 
CAR-T cell therapy, the CR rate achieved with glofitamab was higher than that reported with Zynlonta 
(35% vs. 21).

The sponsor also claimed better safety of glofitamab over Zynlonta in terms of better tolerability based 
on lower incidences of treatment discontinuations due to AEs (9% vs. 21%, respectively), AEs leading 
to dose modifications (18% vs. 47%), and severe AEs (64% vs. 74%) including fatal AEs (5.8% vs.

8.8%). In contrast, there was a higher incidence of AEs related to treatment (94% vs. 82%) and 
serious AEs (49% vs. 41%) with glofitamab compared with Zynlonta (Table 10).  
The sponsor noted that glofitamab has a different safety profile to that of Zynlonta. Although 
myelosuppression and infections were frequently reported AEs common to both glofitamab and 
Zynlonta, phototoxicity and oedema and effusion are important identified risks for Zynlonta and CRS 
and tumor flare are important identified risks for glofitamab. While CRS is the most common adverse 
drug reaction (ADR) for glofitamab, it is manageable with <1% of patients discontinuing glofitamab 
due to AEs. In contrast, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase is the most common ADR with Zynlonta 
and led to treatment discontinuation in 9% of the patients (Zynlonta SmPC).

Update CSR NP30179 (CCOD 15 June 2022). 
Related to either study drug, obinutuzumab or glofitamab, in study NP30179. 
The COMP agreed that the descriptive data presented indicate a numerically higher CR rate and longer 
median DOR in patients with r/r DLBCL who were treated with glofitamab in study NP30179 as 
compared to that reported for Zynlonta in its pivotal study LOTIS-2. However, a methodologically 
sound indirect treatment comparison has not been provided.  
Given the limited experience with glofitamab from a small single-arm study with limited follow-up, the 
claim of improved safety in comparison to Zynlonta cannot be concluded on at present stage and no 
adequate quantification is possible for the descriptive cross-study comparison presented. 
In conclusion, the COMP considered that the sponsor should provide a more detailed overview of the 
baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in the pivotal studies LOTIS-2 for Zynlonta 
versus NP30179 for glofitamab. In addition, the sponsor should submit a matching-adjusted indirect 
comparisons of the efficacy outcomes between patients treated with Zynlonta in LOTIS-2 versus 
patients treated with glofitamab in NP30179. 
Based on the data provided by the sponsor, a positive conclusion on the product’s (glofitamab) 
significant benefit vis a vis the satisfactory methods Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta cannot be 
drawn.

Overall conclusion COMP: 
The significant benefit of glofitamab vis a vis the authorised medicinal products Yescarta, Breyanzi, and 
Zynlonta for the target patient population is not considered established based on the data presented. A 
more comprehensive discussion on the claim of significant benefit for glofitamab over these products is 
therefore needed. The COMP adopted a List of Questions on significant benefit aiming at clarifying the 
differences in key baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in the comparator studies 
and requesting matching-adjusted indirect comparisons of the efficacy outcomes between patients 
treated with Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta versus patients treated with glofitamab. In addition, the 
reported best response and duration of response as achieved with treatment with glofitamab for those 
patients in study NP30179 who were pre-treated with Yescarta was requested. Finally, a more detailed 
discussion on the argument that glofitamab will confer a benefit to patients who would be considered 
ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy was invited. 
Comments on sponsor’s response to the COMP list of issues 
The sponsor further justified the claim for significant benefit of glofitamab over axi-cel (Yescarta) liso-
cel (Breyanzi), and loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) in the third- and later lines setting for the target 
DLBCL population based on more mature efficacy data from the pivotal study NP30179 as requested. 
Efficacy in patients previously treated with CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy 
The sponsor provided updated efficacy results with glofitamab in patients with DLBCL and PMBCL from 
study NP30179 based on a more recent DCO of 16-Jan-2023 with approximately 7 months extended 
follow-up. A summary of all efficacy parameters analysed in study NP30179 for patients treated with 
glofitamab after prior CAR-T cell therapy based on the latest DCO is presented in Table 11. Based on 
these updated results, follow-up for IRC-assessed DOR and DOCR was 9.8 months among the 
responders to glofitamab who received prior Yescarta. Median DOR was 12.6 months (95% CI: 6.7, 
NE) and median DOCR was 6.7 months (95% CI: 5.3, NE). 
The sponsor clarified that because of the timing of the enrolment into study NP30179 compared with 
the approval of Breyanzi, no patients treated with prior CAR-T cell therapy had liso-cel specified as 
their prior CAR-T cell product. However, according to the sponsor, there is no scientific rationale for 
why the clinical efficacy with glofitamab would be any different after prior treatment with Breyanzi 
compared with that observed in the post-Kymriah or post-Yescarta setting. The target (CD19) and 
signalling domains (CD3 zeta) for the three CAR-T cell products are similar, with differences in the co-
stimulatory domains: Kymriah and Breyanzi with 4-1BB (CD137) and Yescarta with CD28.

The sponsor also submitted supportive efficacy results from early-phase studies evaluating glofitamab 
in combination with other agents (no expected activity as monotherapy according to sponsor) in 
patients with r/r DLBCL to further support the benefit of glofitamab in patients treated with glofitamab 
post-Kymriah, post-Yescarta, and post-Breyanzi. However, these data are obtained in a different 
clinical setting and therefore not considered relevant for evaluating the significant benefit for 
glofitamab as monotherapy for r/r DLBCL in the third- and later lines setting. 
Comparison of the patient population characteristics and the outcomes in the comparator 
studies ZUMA-1, TRANSCEND and LOTIS-2 versus the pivotal study NP30179 for glofitamab 
A more comprehensive summary of the baseline characteristics of the patient populations included in 
the pivotal comparator studies ZUMA-1 for axi-cel (Yescarta), TRANSCEND for liso-cel (Breyanzi), and 
LOTIS-2 for loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta), and in the pooled efficacy population of study NP30179 
for glofitamab (N=155 including PMBCL patients) is presented in Table 12. 
Comparative discussion of glofitamab versus axi-cel (Yescarta)  
According to the sponsor, patients in NP30179 seem to represent a harder to treat population than the 
study population of ZUMA-1 for axi-cel. While a numerically higher proportion of patients with prior 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) was included in ZUMA-1 as compared to NP30179 (25% vs. 
19%), the other baseline characteristics reported such as ECOG PS, IPI score, and disease stage were 
comparable between the two study populations. It should be noted, though, that a slightly higher 
proportion of patients received three or more prior lines in ZUMA-1 (69% vs. 61%) and more patients 
also had advanced disease stage III-IV (85% vs. 75%) compared to those included in NP30179.

The updated efficacy analysis for glofitamab (DCO: 16-Jan-2023) confirmed broadly comparable CRRs 
(40% vs. 47%) and more durable responses as compared to axi-cel (N=111 enrolled including patients 
with PMBCL). The median DOR for glofitamab of 18.4 months at a median follow-up of 21.2 months 
was longer than the median DOR of 11.1 months reported for axi-cel in its pivotal study with a median 
follow-up of 27.1 months (Locke et al., 2019). Yet, it should be noted that the ORR for glofitamab was 
lower than that reported for axi-cel (52% vs. 66%). The median DOCR was 26.9 months for glofitamab 
with 68% of CRs in the pooled efficacy population still ongoing at the time of the latest DCO, whereas 
it was not reached for axi-cel. When comparing the efficacy results for the CAR-T naïve subset in study 
NP30179, the response rates observed with glofitamab were broadly comparable, although consistently 
lower, to those reported with axi-cel. However, patients who responded to glofitamab achieved more 
durable responses than those treated with axi-cel. The median DOR for glofitamab was 24.8 months in 
CAR-T naïve patients versus 11.1 months for axi-cel.

Comparative discussion of glofitamab versus liso-cel (Breyanzi)  
The sponsor repeated that the patients who received glofitamab in study NP30179 seem to represent a 
harder to treat population than the study population of TRANSCEND for liso-cel. While a numerically 
higher proportion of patients who had received prior ASCT was included in TRANSCEND as compared to 
study NP30179 (36% vs. 19%), the enrolled patients in NP30179 included a greater proportion of 
patients with IPI score ≥3 (52% vs. 41%), extra-nodal disease (61% vs. 52%), and higher tumour 
burden. The other baseline characteristics reported, including ECOG PS, disease stage, and bulky 
disease, were comparable between the two study populations.  
The sponsor argued that the updated results for glofitamab from study NP30179 (DCO: 16-Jan-2023) 
demonstrated comparable efficacy to liso-cel (N=298 enrolled including patients with PMBCL) based on 
similar CRRs (40% vs. 43%) and durability of the responses. The median DOR for glofitamab of 18.4 
months (median follow-up of 21.2 months) was slightly longer than that reported for liso-cel of 16.8 
months at the latest DCO of its pivotal study (median follow-up 19.9 months; range: 0.2-45.2). It 
should be noted that the ORR for glofitamab was lower than that reported for liso-cel (52% vs. 60%). 
The median DOCR was reported to be 26.9 months for glofitamab and 26.1 months for liso-cel at the 
latest DCO of its pivotal study. When comparing the efficacy results for the CAR-T naïve subset in 
study NP30179, the response rates observed with glofitamab were broadly comparable, although the 
ORR was somewhat lower, to those reported with liso-cel. The median DOR for glofitamab was 24.8 
months in CAR-T naïve patients versus 16.8 months for liso-cel. 
Comparative discussion of glofitamab versus loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta)  
The sponsor repeated that the pooled efficacy population of study NP30179 is considered a harder to 
treat population than the study population of LOTIS-2 for loncastuximab. According to the sponsor, the 
population treated with glofitamab was more heavily pre-treated and included a greater proportion of 
patients who had received prior CAR-T cell therapy (34% vs. 10%). Moreover, the patient population 
in study NP30179 included a higher proportion of patients with IPI score 3-5 and bulky disease (12%

vs. 6%), as patients with bulky disease were excluded from LOTIS-2. The other baseline characteristics 
reported were comparable between the two study populations.   
The sponsor claimed that the updated results from study NP30179 (DCO: 16-Jan-2023) confirmed a 
significant benefit of glofitamab based on improved efficacy over loncastuximab. The ORR for patients 
treated with glofitamab was comparable to the ORR reported for loncastuximab (52% vs. 48%), but 
the median DOR was longer for glofitamab than for loncastuximab (18.4 vs. 13.4 months). Glofitamab 
achieved a higher CRR in treated patients compared with loncastuximab (40% vs. 25%). The median 
DOCR was reported to be 26.9 months for glofitamab and was not reached for loncastuximab at the 
latest DCO of its pivotal study. However, patients treated with glofitamab appeared to achieve more 
durable CRs as the majority of patients who achieved a CR with glofitamab (68%; 42/62) remained in 
complete remission at the DCO (median duration of CR follow-up: 18 months), compared with 44% 
(16/36) in LOTIS-2 after a median follow-up of 8 months (DCO: 01-Mar-2021; Kahl et al., 2021). 
Relative efficacy of glofitamab versus Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta using MAICs 
The sponsor has conducted as requested indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) on efficacy endpoints 
(OR, CR, OS, PFS) and tolerability (based on a proxy of AE leading to dose continuation) between 
glofitamab and Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta based on the matching-adjusted indirect comparison 
(MAIC) methodology. The MAIC analyses presented used data from 155 patients with r/r DLBCL 
(≥ 2 lines of prior therapy) who received the registrational dose of glofitamab (2.5/10/30 mg) in 
Cohorts D2 [Sub. 2], D3, and D5 of study NP30179 at the DCO date of 15-Jun-2022, and published 
data for the comparator products identified through a systematic literature review (SLR) in r/r DLBCL 
(latest search date September 2022), and manual searches after September 2022. For all 
comparators, their respective pivotal studies (ZUMA-1, TRANSCEND NHL 001, and LOTIS-2 for 
Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta, respectively) were used. 
Confounders (prognostic factors and effect modifiers) to adjust for were classified as either high, 
medium, or low priority according to clinical feedback from a panel of external international key 
opinion leaders (KOLs) in lymphoma. The following were classified with high priority: IPI score (age, 
ECOG PS, Ann Arbor stage, high lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] levels, and presence of extra-nodal 
disease), refractoriness to either first line, last line or any line of treatment (some advisors ranked this 
as lower priority compared to the previous two), double/triple hit (DH/TH) lymphoma, histological 
subtype (e.g., HGBCL, PMBCL, or DLBCL/trFL), early relapse after SCT (<12 months), and number of 
prior treatment lines (e.g., 3 vs. >3 [no clinically established threshold], or median). Medium priority 
was assigned to bulky disease (no clinically established threshold), chemotherapy refractoriness, prior 
treatment with (or refractoriness to) rituximab and an anthracycline therapy, rituximab refractoriness, 
and early relapse from last line of treatment (<12 months), or, alternatively, time since completion of 
last therapy. Low priority was given to prior SCT, cell type of origin of the disease, bone marrow 
involvement, primary bone marrow transplant, and primary diagnosis (DLBCL versus non-DLBCL/ 
indolent lymphoma). 
MAIC results versus loncastuximab tesirine (Zynlonta) 
The latest available efficacy data (DCO: 01-Mar-2021) from the pivotal study LOTIS-2 (N=145; as-
treated population) for loncastuximab (Zynlonta) was used, whereas data on baseline characteristics 
available from all LOTIS-2 related publications was considered to inform the list of confounders to 
adjust for in the comparison. 
According to the sponsor, the base-case (BC) analysis maximizes the bias/variance trade-off while 
controlling for all available relevant confounding factors (as per clinical opinion). The differences in

* Differences in the proportion of patients with HGBCL across trials were not adjusted for, as the proportion of 
patients with double-hit/triple-hit lymphoma was considered to be inclusive of these patients. In fact, the proportion 
of patients with HGBCL in LOTIS-2 was only reported for patients with double-hit/triple-hit lymphoma (i.e., it did 
not include patients with HGBCL NOS) and it was lower than that of all patients with double-hit/triple-hit lymphoma 
irrespective of the histology.      
† Refractory disease defined as no response to therapy.  
‡ Previous HSCT is included; for patients who received an autologous transplant, the mobilisation regimen was 
considered a line of therapy if it was chemotherapy-based and distinct from the other previous lines of treatment.  
The effective sample size (ESS) for glofitamab reduced to approximately 72 patients after adjustment, 
indicating that there are differences in baseline characteristics between the two study populations. It 
was noted that the current follow-up for patients on glofitamab appears comparable to that for patients 
on Zynlonta and that progression and responses were based on the Lugano criteria in both studies. 
The sponsor summarised that despite being associated with limitations and requiring longer follow-up 
data to confirm the findings, evidence from the MAIC vis-à-vis Zynlonta was overall supportive of the 
following conclusions: 
• 
The MAIC results showed a strong trend in favour of glofitamab compared to Zynlonta with respect 
to the likelihood of achieving a CR (per IRC), with none of the two OR CIs crossing one. Moreover, 
the MAIC results showed a numerical trend in favour of Zynlonta compared to glofitamab with 
respect to the durability of CRs (per IRC). The results of comparisons on IRC-assessed CR are 
presented in Table 14. A numerical trend in favour of glofitamab compared to Zynlonta with 
respect to the likelihood of achieving an ORR (per IRC) and with regards to the durability of the 
responses were also shown, although both OR CIs for ORR and both HR CIs for DOR crossed one. 
The sponsor expressed that this indicates that there is relatively strong evidence supporting 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

Page 29/34 
 
 
 
 
 
glofitamab being superior to Zynlonta with respect to achieving a CR, but not strong evidence with 
respect to ORR, DOCR and DOR as per IRC assessment.

•  Columvi can be seen as comparable versus Zynlonta, or even superior for some efficacy outcomes 
(CRR, Table 14) and tolerability to Zynlonta as a treatment option for r/r DLBCL patients in the 
third- and later lines setting. As a note, it is also worth pointing out that the proportion of patients 
who received prior treatment with CAR-T cell therapies in the glofitamab population after filtering 
and MAIC-weighting remained higher (~28.3%) than that in the Zynlonta population 
(approximately 9%). 
MAIC results versus axi-cel (Yescarta) and liso-cel (Breyanzi) 
The sponsor also presented MAIC results versus axi-cel (Yescarta) and liso-cel (Breyanzi), but this will 
not be discussed in detail in this report as the efficacy observed with glofitamab in patients who had 
progressed after prior treatment with the approved CD19-directed CAR-T cell products is considered 
sufficient to support a claim of significant benefit over both Yescarta and Breyanzi. 
In summary, the MAIC results showed strong or mild numerical trends in favour of both axi-cel and 
liso-cel with respect to the likelihood of achieving either an ORR or a CR compared to glofitamab as 
well as numerical trends in favour of glofitamab with regards to the durability of the responses 
compared to axi-cel and liso-cel.  
The sponsor argued that the MAIC results indicated that there is relatively strong evidence supporting 
that axi-cel is superior to glofitamab with respect to achieving an ORR and a CR (per investigator), but 
not strong evidence supporting superiority of liso-cel. On the other hand, there is not strong evidence 
supporting that glofitamab is superior to axi-cel and liso-cel with respect to DOR and DOCR, despite 
the trends noted from the results presented. 
The sponsor emphasised that the results for the efficacy endpoints should be interpreted with caution, 
not only due to the relatively smaller ESS after adjustment and filtering for (complete) responders, but 
also because it is not possible to ensure that the prognostic factors and effect modifiers are balanced 
between the responder groups. In fact, the adjustments between each of the comparator studies and 
the pivotal study for glofitamab were performed using data on the combination of responder and non-
responder groups for each treatment (to resemble the outcomes that would have been observed in 
randomized controlled trials [RCTs]), and a sufficiently informative set of baseline characteristics for 
responders only was not available from the comparator studies LOTIS-2, TRANSCEND, and ZUMA-1.

Efficacy of glofitamab in subsets of patient who would be ineligible for CAR-T cell therapy 
The sponsor acknowledged that there currently are no published guidelines or clear consensus among 
physicians regarding exclusion criteria for CAR-T cell therapy. The decisions are made on clinical 
judgment and guidance provided in the approved SmPCs and each country/institution has its own 
definition of clinical ineligibility, mainly based on patients’ age, performance status, and concomitant 
comorbidities. Many of the factors used to determine eligibility/ineligibility for CAR-T cell therapy are 
not concrete factors that can easily be extracted from the data collected as part of study NP30179 
(e.g., disease kinetics, comorbidity index; Shouse et al., 2023; Mian et al., 2021) or are part of a 
combination of factors considered to determine the overall clinical picture for an individual patient. The 
sponsor also noted that patients with rapidly progressing disease are not necessarily ineligible for CAR-
T cell therapy but equally may not be considered eligible since their disease kinetics would not allow 
them to wait for CAR-T cell manufacture and lymphodepletion. 
The sponsor noted that it is challenging to retrospectively identify a population in study NP30179 that 
would be considered ineligible to receive CAR-T cell therapy because of the absence of clear guidelines 
and difficulties to identify/extract factors representing ineligibility for CAR-T cell therapy from the data 
collected. The sponsor has presented efficacy data for glofitamab in five groups of patients within the 
pooled efficacy population of NP30179 that could be considered as ineligible to CAR-T cell therapy 
(Table 15).

In all these groups, glofitamab showed efficacy that is clinically meaningful in terms of response rates, 
DOR, PFS, and OS considering that these patients have exhausted all available therapies based on the 
sponsor’s assumption for the analysis that they were not eligible for CAR-T cell therapy. Based on 
these analyses, the sponsor considered that glofitamab shows a significant benefit for patients who are 
ineligible to CAR-T cell therapy and have exhausted all available therapies.

COMP discussion 
The COMP concluded that the updated efficacy analysis in the subset of patients with prior CAR-T cell 
therapy in the pooled efficacy population of study NP30179 confirmed that glofitamab offered benefit 
for those patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with axi-cel, in addition to 
tisa-cel, as they achieved high and sustained ORRs to glofitamab. The responses observed in these 
subgroups of patients can therefore be considered to constitute a clinically relevant advantage for 
patients with r/r DLBCL in the third- and later lines setting although the data on the time-dependent 
endpoints were still immature. 
Regarding liso-cel, the COMP acknowledged that at the timing of the enrolment into study NP30179, 
Breyanzi was not yet authorised, therefore no patients treated with prior CAR-T cell therapy had liso-
cel specified as their prior CAR-T cell treatment in study NP30179. The COMP also considered the 
durable responses to glofitamab observed in 52 patients who had been treated with prior CAR-T cell 
therapy as clinically meaningful and noted that they represented one third (33.5%; 52/155) of the 
pooled efficacy population of the study. 
Based on the relatively large number of patients pre-treated with at least two of the approved CD19-
directed CAR-T cell products for treatment of DLBCL, the high and sustained ORR observed in this 
patient population and the lack of a scientific rationale that efficacy post-liso-cel would differ from that 
observed post tisa-cel, as both CAR constructs include the same costimulatory endodomain derived 
from the 4-1BB molecule (CD137) in addition to target the same antigen, the COMP concluded that the 
benefit of glofitamab observed in the subset of patients in the pooled efficacy population of study 
NP30179 who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with tisa-cel could also be 
extrapolated to patients who have failed previous treatment with liso-cel. Therefore, the significant 
benefit of glofitamab over liso-cel in addition to tisa-cel and axi-cel, is considered justified based on a 
clinically meaningful benefit for patients with r/r DLBCL who have progressed or relapsed after prior 
treatment with the authorised CAR-T cell products in the third- and later lines setting. 
The COMP considered that the comprehensive summaries presented of the baseline characteristics 
comparing the distribution of clinically important prognostic factors identified a priori (classified with 
high priority) for the r/r DLBCL and PMBCL populations from the pooled efficacy population of study 
NP30179 for glofitamab and the pivotal comparator studies ZUMA-1, TRANSCEND NHL 001, and 
LOTIS-2 for Yescarta, Breyanzi, and Zynlonta, respectively, revealed heterogeneity in the studied 
patient populations. Overall, from the summary presented, it seems that the baseline characteristics of 
the patient population in LOTIS-2 for Zynlonta is comparable to that included in study NP30179 for 
glofitamab with some differences (mainly higher proportion of patients being primary refractory and 
refractory to last line of treatment, as well as those who had received prior CAR-T cell therapies), while 
the study population in TRANSCEND for Breyanzi also is less heavily pre-treated and appears to have 
had a better prognosis at study entry than those included in study NP30179. 
The naïve side-by-side comparison of results from the pivotal study LOTIS-2 for loncastuximab versus 
that for glofitamab provided sufficient evidence to support the claim of a clinically relevant advantage 
of glofitamab based on improved efficacy in terms of more durable anti-tumour responses and higher 
and sustained CRs compared to that obtained with loncastuximab in patients with r/r DLBCL in the 
third- and later lines setting. The MAIC results described below also showed a trend in favour of 
glofitamab compared to loncastuximab with respect to the likelihood of achieving a CR or an ORR and 
with regards to the durability of the responses. The COMP hence concluded that the improved and 
sustained CRs with glofitamab compared to loncastuximab can justify the significant benefit in r/r 
DLBCL.

The COMP noted that the observed imbalances in identified risk factors were adjusted for in the 
unanchored MAIC approach conducted for the patient populations in the pivotal studies. The sponsor 
also adjusted for covariates in the MAICs that were considered less important to clinical outcomes in 
DLBCL and were classified a prior as either medium or low priority, in addition to confounders that 
were identified as important and therefore classified as high priority. This approach led to substantial 
reductions in the ESS for the MAICs, with a down-weighting of 54% (83/155) and as much as around 
80% of the pooled efficacy population in study NP30179 for the adjusted BC populations compared 
correspondingly to the populations from LOTIS-2 and each of the two pivotal studies for the CAR-T cell 
products axi-cel and liso-cel. The results for the MAIC versus Zynlonta are broadly in line with the 
findings from the descriptive side-by-side comparison within a potentially more difficult to treat patient 
population. The MAIC comparing glofitamab with the CAR-T cell products axi-cel and liso-cel are 
difficult to interpret and are therefore not considered sufficiently robust and reliable. Overall, the MAIC 
results did not provide conclusive evidence on improved efficacy especially versus axi-cel and liso-cel 
in view of the large reduction of the ESS and contradictory results across several efficacy parameters. 
The ESS for the MAIC versus loncastuximab was more acceptable. 
The COMP acknowledged that the sponsor has adequately discussed and presented results from 
exploratory analyses in five different patient subgroups from study NP30179 that possibly could have 
been considered ineligible to receive CAR-T cell therapy. However, the efficacy results from the 
analyses presented cannot be taken into consideration as none of the factors identified to representing 
ineligibility for CAR-T cell therapy are contraindications for this class of products and, as also 
recognised by the sponsor, there are currently no guidelines or clear consensus among physicians 
regarding eligibility criteria for CAR-T cell therapy. 
COMP conclusion  
In conclusion the sponsor has provided clinical study data that demonstrated improved and sustained 
complete responses with Columvi as compared to Zynlonta and a clinically meaningful benefit in 
subgroups of patients who have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with the authorised CAR-
T cell products (Kymriah, Yescarta, and Breyanzi) for adult patients with r/r DLBCL, after two or more 
lines of systemic therapy.

4.  COMP position adopted on 17 May 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 4.3 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to constitutional symptoms, local symptoms of 
lymphadenopathy, end-organ damage from disease involvement, and bone marrow failure that 
may lead to infections, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia and life-threatening in patients not 
responding to treatment; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union for all the patients covered by Columvi, the assumption that Columvi may be of 
potential significant benefit to those affected by the orphan condition still holds. The sponsor has 
provided clinical study data that demonstrated improved and sustained complete responses with 
Columvi as compared to Zynlonta and a clinically meaningful benefit in subgroups of patients who 
have progressed or relapsed after prior treatment with the authorised CAR-T cell products 
(Kymriah, Yescarta, and Breyanzi) for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Columvi, glofitamab for 
treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EU/3/21/2497) is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

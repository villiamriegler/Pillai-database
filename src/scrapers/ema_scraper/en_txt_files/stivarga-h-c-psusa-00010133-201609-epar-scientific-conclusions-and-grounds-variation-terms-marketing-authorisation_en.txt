Scientific  conclusions  and  grounds  for  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing 
authorisations 
Based on a numerically higher rate of dehydration in the regorafenib arm of clinical trials and 403 
serious events reported from post-marketing sources and although it is acknowledged that the event 
of dehydration is secondary to other conditions (such as diarrhoea and vomiting), considering the 
number of reported events, the seriousness of the cases, and also in line with the information given in 
the SmPC of the other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ‘dehydration’ should be added to the table of adverse 
drug reactions with the frequency ‘common’.

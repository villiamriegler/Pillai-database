Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: The RMP was updated to align with the 
conclusion of 192 weeks of treatment in Study VX17-445-105 (Study 105). Study 105 is an 
open-label, extension study evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, homozygous, or heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR mutation who participated in Study VX17-445-102 (Study 102) or Study 
VX17-445-103 (Study 103).  
This RMP consolidates currently approved RMP Version 7.3 with Version 7.2.  
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: The RMP was updated to reflect the 
completion of 192 weeks of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in Study 105. The details of relevant 
important safety concerns were updated to align with the findings from 192 weeks of 
treatment in Study 105.  
This RMP consolidates currently approved RMP Version 7.3 with Version 7.2. Version 7.3 
was updated to align with the conclusion of 96 weeks of treatment in Study VX19-445-107 
(Study 107). Study 107 is an open-label, extension study evaluating the long-term safety and 
efficacy of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in CF subjects 6 years of age and older, homozygous or 
heterozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation who participated in Study VX18-445-106 
(Study 106). Study 107 was included in the RMP as a postmarketing commitment and this 
RMP was updated to reflect completion of the RMP milestone, i.e., the completion of 96 
weeks of treatment. Additionally, per PRAC request, the questionnaire for postmarketing 
surveillance of pregnant and lactating women was updated with a corresponding update to 
Part III.1 Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities.  
The clinical trial and post-authorisation exposures were updated to the data lock date of this 
RMP.

ELX is N-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-sulfonyl)-6-[3-(3,3,3-trifluoro-2,2- 
dimethylpropoxy)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]-2-[(4S)-2,2,4-trimethylpyrrolidin- 
1-yl]pyridine-3-carboxamide. 
TEZ is 1-(2,2-difluoro-2H-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-{1-[(2R)-
2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(1-hydroxy-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-
1Hindol-5-yl}cyclopropane-1-carboxamide 
IVA is 
N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxamide 
ELX is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector 
that facilitates the cellular processing and trafficking of multiple mutant forms of 
CFTR (including F508del-CFTR) to increase the amount of functional CFTR 
protein delivered to the correct location in the cell surface, resulting in increased 
chloride transport. The effect of TEZ (another CFTR corrector) administered in 
combination with ELX is additive to the effect of ELX alone. 
IVA is a CFTR potentiator that increases the channel open probability (or gating) 
of CFTR at the cell surface to enhance chloride transport. For IVA to function, 
CFTR protein must be present at the cell surface. IVA can potentiate the CFTR 
protein delivered to the cell surface by ELX and TEZ, leading to a further 
enhancement of chloride transport than achieved with any of the dual 
combinations.

 Safety Specification 
SI Epidemiology of Indication(s) and Target Population(s) 
CYSTIC FIBROSIS 
The target population for elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
(ELX/TEZ/IVA) is patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who have at least one F508del mutation 
in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  
SI.1 
Incidence 
Europe: The incidence of CF in Europe varies markedly, ranging from 1:1,353 in Ireland to 
1:25,000 in Finland.1 Annual cumulative incidence estimates reported for other European 
countries include: Austria 1 in 3,500, Belgium 1 in 2,850, Bulgaria 1 in 3,250, Cyprus 1 in 
7,914, Czech Republic 1 in 2,833, Denmark 1 in 4,700, France 1 in 4,348, Germany 1 in 
3,300, Hungary 1 in 4,000, Italy 1 in 4,238, Netherlands 1 in 4,750, Norway 1 in 8,642, 
Slovakia 1 in 1,800, Slovenia 1 in 3,000, Spain 1 in 3,750, Sweden 1 in 5,600, and UK 1 in 
2,381.1   
US: In the US, among white persons, CF occurs in approximately 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 live 
births. In other races and ethnicities, CF occurs less commonly, including approximately 1 in 
4,000 to 10,000 Latin Americans, 1 in 15,000 to 20,000 African Americans, and even less 
commonly in Asian Americans.2 In 2017, 880 new cases of CF were diagnosed in the US.3  
Canada: In Canada, based on CF patient registry data in 2000, approximately 1 in 3,600 
children were born with CF.4
CF, including 66 patients diagnosed through newborn screening programmes.5 
Australia: Approximately 1 in 3,700 children in Australia were born with CF in 2017.6 
  In Canada in 2017, 115 patients were newly diagnosed with 
SI.2 
Prevalence 
General CF Population 
CF affects more than 70,000 individuals worldwide.7  
Europe: A survey of standards of care in Europe conducted from 2007 to 2009, EuroCare CF, 
estimated there were 39,897 patients with CF who were treated in 32 European countries.8 
According to another survey performed by Orphanet, the prevalence of CF from European 
data is 0.74 per 10,000.9 
Overall, the prevalence of CF in 27 countries in the EU was estimated at 0.737 per 
10,000 people, ranging from 0.10 in Latvia to 2.98 in Ireland.1   
US: In the US in 2017, there were 29,887 patients with CF in the US CF Foundation patient 
registry; an overall prevalence of 0.9 per 10,000 people.3, 10

Page 9 of 58 
Canada: In Canada in 2017, there were 4,309 patients with CF in the Canadian CF Registry; 
an overall prevalence of 1.18 per 10,000 people.5, 10  
Australia: In Australia in 2017, there were 3,151 patients with CF in the Australian CF Data 
Registry; an overall prevalence of 1.3 per 10,000 people.6, 11  
Target Population  
Europe: Based on the 2017 report from the European CF Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) 
that included data on 48,204 patients with CF from 35 countries in the EU, 81.1% of the 
patients with available genotype data and who were seen in 2017 had at least one F508del 
allele.12 
US: Based on the 2017 report from the US CF Foundation patient registry that included data 
on 29,887 patients with CF, 98.6% of the patients in the registry had been genotyped. Of the 
patients with available genotype data, 85.8% had at least one F508del allele.3 
Canada: Based on the 2017 report from the Canadian CF Registry that included data on 
4,309 patients with CF, 98.3% of the patients in the registry had at least 1 CF mutation 
genotyped. Of those with available genotype data, 89.1% had at least one F508del allele.5   
Australia: Based on the 2017 report from the Australian CF registry that included data on 
3,151 patients with CF, 94.1% of the patients in the registry had been genotyped. Of those 
with available genotype data, 89.2% had at least one F508del allele.6 
SI.3 
Demographics of the Population in the Authorised Indication and Risk Factors 
for the Disease 
Risk Factors for the disease 
CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. To have CF, a person must inherit 2 copies of 
the defective CFTR gene (1 copy from each parent) that lead to dysfunctional CFTR protein.   
Age at diagnosis 
With increased rates of neonatal screening, the age at CF diagnosis is decreasing. The median 
age at diagnosis was approximately 2, 4, and 2 months, as reported by the CF registries in 
UK13, Ireland14, and France15, respectively. Across 35 countries that contributed data to 
ECFSPR in 2017, the median age at diagnosis was 4.0 months.12
Similarly, in the US, the median age at diagnosis was 3 months according to a 2017 registry 
report.3  
In Canada, newborn screening is performed in all provinces (Quebec added CF testing to 
their newborn screening in 2018). In 2017, the majority (59.9%) of individuals with CF were 
diagnosed by 1 year of age.5 
Age distribution among prevalent patients 
Of the 48,204 CF patients from 35 countries in the ECFSPR (including non-EU member 
states) in 2017 and with a patient encounter in that year, the mean age was 20.8 years and of 
the total population 51.3% were older than 18 years of age.12  
In the US, 53.5% of all CF patients were adults 18 years or older based on the 2017 annual 
registry report.3 Despite the gains in median survival, the age distribution remains markedly 
skewed to the young. While the age of US CF patients ranged from birth to a maximum age 
of 87.7 years, the mean age was 21.7 years in 2017.3

KAFTRIO (ELX/TEZ/IVA) Risk Management Plan    
Page 10 of 58 
In Canada in 2017, CF patients ranged from birth to more than 70 years old, with the median 
age being reported as 22.8 years and 60.9% of patients with CF were 18 years or older, with 
15.2% being over 40 years of age, and 0.5% over the age of 70.5  
Sex 
Commonly, women with CF have been described to have worse outcomes than males.16-18  
Among CF children in Europe, a male preponderance exists at birth and persists and is 
reflected at all ages.19 Based on the ECFSPR report for 2017, 52.6% out of 48,204 CF 
patients from 35 countries were males.12
 In the 2018 annual report for the UK, 53% of 
patients were males.13  
In the US 2017 annual registry report, 51.6% of all CF patients were males.3    
In Canada, based on 2017 annual patient registry report, 53.9% of patients with CF were 
males.5  
Race / ethnic origin 
CF affects all racial and ethnic groups, but is more common among Caucasians.20 Among CF 
patients in the US, 93.6% were Caucasians, 4.6% African Americans, and 3.6% other races, 
with 8.7% being identified as Hispanic (any race) (races are not mutually exclusive as 
recorded in US CF Foundation).3 
SI.4  Main Existing Treatment Options 
With the exception of drugs that target the CFTR function, such as Orkambi™ (lumacaftor in 
combination with IVA), Kalydeco™ (IVA monotherapy), and Symdeko™/Symkevi™ (TEZ in

Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population 
Mortality 
EuroCare CF reported median age at death for 14 European countries varied between 
18.7 years in Poland and 33.0 years in the Netherlands, with the exception of Macedonia 
where the median age at death was 9.5 years.8 A female survival disadvantage exists.12  
A patient with CF born in the last 2 decades of the 20th century (in an economically 
developed nation) is now expected to have a greater-than-50% chance of survival to 40 years 
of age.19 In an international cohort of 366 patients with CF aged 40 years or older from 
Canada, UK, US, and Italy, the estimated annual mortality rate was 3.4%.18

Morbidity 
While mutations in the CFTR gene affect secretory glands, the most affected organs are 
lungs, pancreas, liver/gallbladder, intestines, sinuses, vas deferens, and sweat glands. Other 
complications of CF include CF-related diabetes (CFRD), bone disease, CF-related 
arthropathy, and anxiety and depression. 
SI.6 
Important Comorbidities 
The important comorbidities of CF include CF lung disease, CF liver disease, CFRD, 
CF-related osteoporosis and osteopenia, pancreatic insufficiency/malnutrition, anxiety and 
depression, and cardiac disease. 
SI.6.1 
Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease 
CF lung disease is the most prevalent manifestation of CF. The natural history of CF lung 
disease is one of chronic airway infection and gradual progression driven by intermittent 
episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbations. This progression typically starts with mucus 
plugging of peripheral airways and concomitant air trapping. Retained mucus plugs and 
plaques within the airway serve as a nidus of chronic infection by certain pathogens, such as 
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are particularly well adapted to 
surviving in retained airway secretions. Inflammation and scarring associated with this 
chronic airway infection results in bronchial wall thickening and progressive bronchiectasis.

Page 12 of 58 
Recent studies indicate that the episodes of acute pulmonary exacerbation, representing 
infectious flares, drive these later stage findings, reflecting overall lung disease progression. 
In 2017, 46.4% of US CF patients had at least one positive culture for P aeruginosa as 
characterised by the Leeds criteria, with 28.6% being categorised as having chronic infection 
and 17.8% as intermittent infection, and for methicillin-resistant S aureus, Burkholderia 
cepacia complex, S aureus, the prevalence is 25.9%, 2.5%, and 70.7%, respectively.3 
Pulmonary infection is the most pronounced clinical issue and the progressive pulmonary 
dysfunction is the main prognostic factor for patients with CF. 
According to the 2017 report from the CF Registry of Ireland, 34.6% of patients had at least 
one pulmonary exacerbation requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics; 24.4% of children 
(<18 years, n=130) and 42.3% of adults (≥18 years; n=298).14 In 3 studies of children and 
adults with CF that used computed tomography (CT) to detect lung disease, bronchiectasis 
was the most common lung abnormality. In cohorts in Italy, Austria, and the Netherlands, 
bronchiectasis was identified in 89%, 80%, and 76% of patients, respectively; similarly, 
bronchial wall thickening was identified in 48%, 76%, and 85% of patients with CF, 
respectively. Mucous plugging was identified in 29%, 51%, and 79%, respectively.23-25 The 
relative prevalence of CT findings in these populations reflects the sampling of relatively 
older CF patients in these studies. 
Lung disease severity tends to increase with age among those with moderate and poor lung 
function.3  
CF lung disease is characterised by progressive airway obstruction as measured by percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1). The European Epidemiologic 
Registry of CF collected FEV1 data for 7,010 patients aged 6 years and older. Cross-sectional 
analysis of the 3 age groups in the study demonstrated a progressively lower ppFEV1 with 
advancing age. Whereas children aged 6 to 12 years have mean values of ppFEV1 (79.1) 
reflecting mild airway obstruction, patients in the 13 to 17 years and 18 years and older age 
groups showed mean values of 67.8 and 54.1, respectively, reflecting progression to moderate 
airway obstruction.26 Taken together, these values reflect progressive lung disease from the 
earliest age at which lung function is measurable. 
Lung disease is the most serious complication of CF, causing the majority of mortality in 
patients with CF. In the US, 62.9% of all 2017 deaths were due to 
respiratory/cardiorespiratory and 16.1% were transplant-related.3 Of all the 380 deaths which 
occurred in 2017, 47.6% occurred in people who were F508del homozygotes.3 
SI.6.2 
Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease 
While there is no standard, universally-accepted definition of what constitutes CF liver 
disease, the literature is generally in agreement that the majority of CF patients will at some 
time have evidence of a wide range of liver abnormalities, including those in liver 
biochemistry, changes on ultrasound and/or hepatomegaly, or other abnormalities as 
follows:27-30

As defined by a combination of any 2 signs (i.e., hepatomegaly/splenomegaly, increased liver 
function tests (LFTs), and/or ultrasound), the cumulative incidence of CF liver disease based 
on long-term follow-up was 18% in the US, 27% in Italy, and 28% in Israel.31-33  
The incidence rate of CF liver disease was reported as 3.61 per 100 person-years (PY) in a 
cohort in Montreal, Canada, and 1.8 per 100 PY in a cohort from Milan, Italy.32, 34  
Liver function test abnormalities 
Liver abnormalities are very common among CF infants with up to 53% having elevated 
LFTs by 3 years of age.35 In 2 large CF patient registries in UK (2018) and Australia (2017), 
prevalence of abnormal LFTs in the overall CF population (all ages) was reported at 9.0% 
and 10.2%, respectively.6, 13  
Based on the analysis of data from 376 participants of 3 multi-centre CF studies with an 
average follow-up of 8.3 months, the incidence rate for developing: any alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increase was 2 per 100 person-months, any LFT abnormality was 
3.4 per 100 person-months, and any clinically significant LFT abnormality was 0.4 per 
100 person-months.36  
If followed for 5 to 10 years, about 35% to 50% of CF patients would have LFT elevations on 
at least 1 occasion,32, 34 with up to 93% of patients with LFT abnormalities over 20 years of 
follow-up.37  
Of note, while transient or even persistent LFT increases are frequent in CF, they have a low 
sensitivity and specificity in predicting clinically significant CF liver disease. For instance, in 
1 study among patients with abnormal liver enzyme testing, 25% went on to develop CF liver 
disease during follow-up (mean of 8 years).31  
Clinically significant liver disease  
While biochemical or ultrasound liver abnormalities are commonly observed in CF patients, 
clinically significant CF liver disease (such as multilobular cirrhosis and/or portal 
hypertension) affects a much smaller percentage of the CF population. 
The literature suggests that up to 10% of patients with CF develop cirrhosis, with most of 
these patients having signs of portal hypertension.32, 35, 38 In the US patient registry in 2017, 
prevalence of cirrhosis in the CF population was 3.1%. In the UK patient registry in 2018, 
prevalence in the CF population for cirrhosis without portal hypertension was 0.7% and 
prevalence of cirrhosis with portal hypertension was 1.1%.3,11 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited

Page 14 of 58 
Two prospective studies32, 34 reported sufficient data to estimate the incidence rates of 
clinically significant liver disease. Using the reported case counts and person-time from these 
2 studies, the rates were estimated at: 
•  7 to 8 per 1,000 patient years for cirrhosis,  
•  5.3 to 5.5 per 1,000 patient-years for cirrhosis with portal hypertension,  
•  1.6 per 1,000 patient-years for cirrhosis with varices, and 
•  3.4 per 1,000 patient-years for hepatic failure. 
Liver disease, including liver failure, remains an important non-pulmonary cause of death, 
accounting for about 3.4% of overall CF mortality in the US.3  
In Ireland, among all deaths recorded between 2002 and 2014, 4.0% were caused by liver 
disease.39  
During 7-year follow-up of 36 children with CF liver disease, 3 (8%) patients died from liver 
failure and 1 (3%) patient received a liver transplant. Another 3 (8%) patients with CF liver 
disease died from pulmonary failure. Overall, the mortality at 7 years was 19.4% in the 
cohort of patients with CF liver disease.40 
SI.6.3 
Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes 
Three analyses estimated the prevalence of CFRD at approximately 30%. A cohort of 
children and adults with CF in the Netherlands reported a prevalence of CFRD of 31%41, and 
2 cohorts from Georgia and Minnesota, US, reported 31.2% and 33% CFRD, respectively.42, 
43 The prevalence increased with age, reaching 31% to 50% in adults.41-43  
In the 2 largest CF patient registries (US and UK), prevalence of CFRD in the US in 
2017 was 18.5% (overall) and in the UK in 2018 was 26.6% (ages ≥10 years old).3, 13 CFRD 
increases with age, with prevalence of 31.0% among those 18 years and older versus 5.3% 
among those younger than 18 years in US (2017)3, and 31.1% among those ≥16 years of age 
versus 7.4% among those 10 to 15 years of age in UK (2018).13  
The annual incidence of CFRD was estimated at 3.8% in a Danish cohort44, 3.5% in a British 
cohort45, and 2.7% in a US cohort.43 In the Danish study, the annual incidence increased with 
age and was 5% for patients aged 10 years or older and 9.3% for patients aged 20 years or 
older.44 
It is believed that CFRD causes a more rapid decline in pulmonary function and nutrition 
status, particularly in female patients, compared to CF patients without CFRD. There is also 
evidence that CFRD is associated with increased mortality.46  
Data from the UK CF Registry showed the age-adjusted mortality rate among patient with 
CFRD was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.4 to 5.1) per 100 PY, while the rate in 
patients with CF but without CFRD was only 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3 to 1.7) per 100 PY.47 In a US 
study, the overall mortality rate for patients with CFRD was 1.8 per 100 PY, compared with 
0.5 in patients with CF without diabetes.48 
SI.6.4 
Cystic Fibrosis-Related Osteoporosis and Osteopenia 
Bone mass is abnormally low in patients with CF, even when their treatment includes large 
supplements of vitamin D and calcium.49 Low bone mineral density value was found even 
with daily calcium dosages of 1200 or 1500 mg.50-53  
A meta-analysis of osteoporosis, osteopenia, and vertebral and non-vertebral fractures among 
adults with CF reported pooled prevalence of 23.5%, 38%, 14%, and 19.7%, respectively.54 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited 
 
 
 
 
 
 
KAFTRIO (ELX/TEZ/IVA) Risk Management Plan    
Page 15 of 58 
In 2017, about 3.8% and 10.4% of people with CF in the US were reported to have 
osteoporosis and osteopenia, respectively.3 In the UK in 2018, 4.7% and 10.3% of all CF 
patients had osteoporosis and osteopenia, respectively.13  
Fractures are very common in patients with CF, and often more than 1 fracture occurs during 
the life of a patient with CF.49 Studies estimated that fracture rate was increased 2-fold in 
women aged 16 to 34 years and in men aged 25 to 45 years, as compared to the general 
population.50 
SI.6.5 
Pancreatic Insufficiency / Malnutrition 
Pancreatic insufficiency predisposing to fat malabsorption, steatorrhoea, and failure to thrive 
affects greater than 90% of patients with CF and is present at the time of diagnosis in the 
majority of patients who are diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. Patients diagnosed through 
newborn screening may not be symptomatic at the time of diagnosis; however, a significant 
proportion are pancreatic insufficient at birth and early treatment with pancreatic enzymes 
and close attention to nutritional management have been shown to result in improved 
growth.55   
Two studies independently found that among cohorts of patients with CF in Canada and the 
US, 87% had pancreatic insufficiency.56, 57 In a cohort of patients with CF over 40 years of 
age in the UK, 82% had pancreatic insufficiency as identified in clinical notes.58 
SI.6.6 
Anxiety and Depression 
Estimates of prevalence of depression and anxiety in CF patients vary by the method of 
ascertainment, geography, and age.  
In the US in 2017, a clinical diagnosis of depression was reported in 15.5% and anxiety 
disorder was reported in 12.5% of all CF patients.3 In 2017, depression or anxiety was 
diagnosed in 12.6% of CF patients in Canada.5 
In the CF population, the prevalence of depression increases in adolescents and in young 
adults and remains high through older ages. In the US in 2017, depression was reported in 
3.6% of patients <18 years of age and 26.8% of patients ≥18 years of age; anxiety disorder 
was reported in 4.1% of patients <18 years of age and 20.6% of patients ≥18 years of age.3 In 
Canada in 2017, depression or anxiety was clinically diagnosed in 4.7% of patients <18 years 
of age and in 17.6% of patients ≥18 years of age.5 
In 2014, Quittner et al. published results from a large international study across 154 centres in 
Europe and the US that screened for depression and anxiety in a sample of 6,088 CF patients, 
as well as a community sample of 4,102 caregivers who have children with CF. The 
prevalence of depressive symptoms was 2 times higher in the sample of CF patients 
compared to the community sample, highlighted in higher burden of these conditions in the 
CF population.59  
Within this same study by Quittner et al., the sample of CF patients included 
1,286 adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) and 4,739 adults (aged ≥18 years). Depending on age 
and the screening tool used, rates of depression varied across countries, ranging from 
5 to 19% in adolescents and 13 to 29% in adults. Furthermore, 4% of the adolescent patients 
with CF and 10% of the adult patients with CF reported currently taking a psychiatric 
medication for depression/anxiety, while 6% of the adolescent CF patients and 8% of the 
adult CF patients reported currently receiving psychotherapy.59 
In 2015, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society published recommendations for 
annual screening and treatment of depression and anxiety in all individuals with CF who are

12 years of age and older. As a steady increase is being observed in the number of patients 
screened for anxiety and depression, the prevalence of diagnosed anxiety and depression is 
also increasing over time.3 
SI.6.7 
Cardiac Disease 
Cardiac disease as a result of progressive hypoxia due to severe lung disease is usually 
described as right ventricular dysfunction and cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale, as defined by 
hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from diseases affecting the function and/or 
structure of the lung, except when these pulmonary alterations are the result of diseases that 
primarily affect the left side of the heart or of congenital heart disease60, has been reported for 
patients with CF since 1946. The prevalence of cor pulmonale has varied from 6% to 70% 
when based on postmortem studies.61  
Heart failure has been reported at a prevalence of 8.3% among a cohort of patients with CF in 
Ohio, US.21 Ischemic heart disease has not historically been reported for patients with CF. 
However, given the high-fat diet and comorbid CFRD, there is speculation that as more 
patients with CF live into adulthood there may be an increase in ischemic heart disease. A 
case report for the first symptomatic myocardial infarction in a patient with CF has been 
published.62 However, there are no estimates for incidence or prevalence of ischemic heart 
disease. 
Of 170 patients who died at a CF clinic in Ohio, US, 55 (32%) had overt right heart failure at 
least 2 weeks before death. Among 61 patients with CF and heart failure, the mean survival 
was 8 months with a median survival of 4 months.21 
SII  Nonclinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Nonclinical studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacologic activity of ELX and to 
characterise its pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicity profile (Module 2.4). TEZ and IVA were 
previously evaluated in similar sets of studies to support the clinical development of 
Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco, respectively. Several studies involving the 
co-administration of combination therapy with ELX, TEZ, and IVA were also conducted.  
SII.1  Toxicity 
The nonclinical safety programme supports the chronic administration of the triple 
combination (TC) regimen of ELX/TEZ/IVA in humans at the intended clinical doses.  
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, key findings included gastric erosions and/or 
ulcerations, hypocellularity of the bone marrow, seminiferous tubule degeneration and/or 
testicular atrophy, persistent corpus luteum in the ovaries, and reduced fertility. There was at 
least a 2× exposure margin (based on no-observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL]) for these 
rat-specific findings. Similar findings were not observed in the 28-day and 39-week dog 
studies even though markedly higher systemic exposures were achieved (19× exposure 
margin at NOAEL for 39-week study). The Phase 3 clinical data suggest that these 
nonclinical findings do not translate to humans; therefore, based on this and the established 
exposure margins, these findings are considered rat-specific and are not anticipated to present 
a risk to humans at the therapeutic dose (ELX 200 mg/day).  
Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 3 months in duration in rats and 28 days in 
duration in dogs did not result in any new or synergistic toxicities following 
co-administration with ELX, TEZ, and IVA. Based on these findings, there are no anticipated 
risks associated to humans with co-administration of the TC therapy. 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited

Page 17 of 58 
ELX was not teratogenic in rat and rabbit embryo-foetal development studies. No adverse 
findings were identified in the rat pre- and post-natal development and juvenile toxicity 
studies. Therefore, there is minimal human risk of developmental toxicity with ELX.  
Placental transfer of 14C-ELX, 14C-TEZ, and 14C-IVA associated radioactivity was observed 
in pregnant rats. After oral administration to lactating female rats, 14C-ELX, 14C-TEZ, and 
14C-IVA were excreted in the milk.  
ELX was non-genotoxic, did not cause the formation of pre-neoplastic or other proliferative 
lesions in any tissue in the 28-day, 3-month, and chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs, and 
was non-carcinogenic in a 26-week Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity assay. In the 
2-year oral carcinogenicity study in rats evaluating the carcinogenic potential of ELX, 
administration of ELX up to 10 mg/kg/day by oral gavage in male and female rats for up to 
93 weeks did not results in neoplastic or non-neoplastic findings. 
Similarly, TEZ and IVA were non-genotoxic, non-carcinogenic in a 26-week Tg.rasH2 
transgenic mouse carcinogenicity assay (TEZ), non-carcinogenic in a 2-year carcinogenicity 
bioassay in mice (IVA), and non-carcinogenic in a 2-year bioassay in rats (TEZ and IVA). 
Based on the available data, the overall carcinogenic risk associated with the TC regimen is 
low.  
SII.2 
Safety Pharmacology  
Results from safety pharmacology studies and secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) screening 
evaluating ELX, TEZ, and IVA suggest a high degree of selectivity and a low potential for 
adverse biological or physiological effects when ELX, TEZ, and IVA are administered in 
combination. Furthermore, in a thorough QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) study, 
there were no clinically important trends attributable to ELX dosing identified in vital sign 
assessments, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and no effects were noted in ECG data, 
including QTc prolongation or arrhythmias.  
SII.3  Pharmacokinetics 
ELX, TEZ, and IVA absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and PK properties 
have been adequately characterised to support the registration of the ELX, TEZ, and IVA TC 
therapy.  
ELX was orally bioavailable in all species tested. Systemic exposures to ELX, TEZ, and IVA 
in combination studies in rats and dogs were similar to the exposures observed when these 
compounds were dosed individually. Adequate exposures of ELX, TEZ, and IVA were 
achieved for nonclinical safety evaluation.  
After oral administration of 14C-ELX, 14C-TEZ, or 14C-IVA, radioactivity was rapidly 
distributed across most tissues in rats. Protein binding is high for ELX (>98.9%), TEZ 
(≥98.0%), and IVA (>99.3%) in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human plasma, and is similar 
across species.  
ELX metabolism was similar between nonclinical species and humans. M23-445 is a major 
circulating metabolite observed for ELX in humans. M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ are major 
circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans and rats. M2-TEZ is a major disproportionate 
circulating metabolite of TEZ in humans. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the major circulating 
metabolites of IVA in all species studied. All major metabolites of ELX, TEZ, and IVA have 
been adequately qualified in nonclinical toxicity studies.  
ELX, TEZ, and IVA are substrates of CYP3A. Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers or 
inhibitors may affect their exposures. ELX, TEZ, IVA and their metabolites are predicted to

Exposure 
A dedicated study (Study 007) evaluating the safety and PK of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in 11 subjects without CF who have moderate hepatic 
impairment has been conducted. Final safety data from this study were 
generally consistent with the safety data in other subjects treated with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
No studies in patients with severe hepatic impairment are planned.  
In the controlled, Phase 3 studies (Studies 102 and 103) and the open-label 
extension study (Study 105) in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, 
12 subjects with a medical history of portal hypertension, hepatic cirrhosis, 
and/or portal/hepatic fibrosis received ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. The safety 
data in these 12 subjects were generally consistent with the safety data in 
other subjects treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Overall, the safety experience in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment is limited. 
In the controlled, Phase 3 studies (Studies 102 and 103) and the open-label 
extension study (Study 105) in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, 2 
subjects with a medical history of chronic kidney disease received 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. Overall, the safety data in these 2 subjects were 
consistent with the safety data in other subjects treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
Clinical studies excluded subjects who had very severe lung dysfunction at 
Screening (i.e., ppFEV1 <40); however, a small subset of subjects who had 
ppFEV1 <40 at baseline (predose) were enrolled. In the controlled, Phase 3 
studies (Studies 102 and 103) and the open-label extension study (Study 
105) in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, 44 subjects with ppFEV1 <40

these 44 subjects were consistent with the safety data in other subjects 
treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.

Method Used to Calculate Exposure 
Cumulative post-authorisation exposures were estimated using data at the time of 
distribution, not necessarily the time of usage. There might be a delay between the time a 
medication was distributed and the time a medication was used by a patient. Caution must be 
exercised when using post-authorisation exposure estimates to evaluate spontaneous reports. 
The methodology used for estimating post-authorisation exposure may vary by geographic 
region, as described below.

SVI  Additional EU Requirements for Safety Specification 
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes 
No systematic examination of the abuse potential of ELX, TEZ, or IVA was performed in the 
ELX nonclinical and clinical development programmes. Nonclinical studies did not 
demonstrate any evidence of neurobehavioural side effects. Evaluation of adverse events 
(AEs) in clinical studies did not reveal any evidence of euphoria, sedation, or mood 
alteration. 
Therefore, ELX/TEZ/IVA use is not expected to have the potential for misuse for illegal 
purposes.  
ELX/TEZ/IVA is available by prescription only. 
SVII  Identified and Potential Risks  
SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP 
The following risks are described in Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) of the EU Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC), but are not considered to be important risks given the events 
in clinical studies were mostly mild to moderate in severity and non-serious, with few study 
drug discontinuations; therefore, they are not expected to have a significant impact on the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA benefit-risk profile: 
•  Upper respiratory tract infection 
•  Headache  
•  Nasal congestion 
•  Rhinorrhoea 
•  Diarrhoea 
•  Abdominal pain 
•  Rash 
•  Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 
•  Rhinitis 
•  Abdominal pain upper 
•  Flatulence 
•  Hypoglycaemia 
•  Acne 
•  Dizziness 
•  Pruritus 
•  Wheezing 
•  Respiration abnormal (abnormal breathing) 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older 
(VX17-445-102 [Study 102]), a modest increase from baseline in mean BP was observed in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (systolic BP increased between 2.0 mm Hg and 3.5 mm Hg). The 
incidence of subjects in the hypertensive range was similar between the ELX/TEZ/IVA and 
placebo groups, with few AEs of BP increased reported overall. As such, the modest increase 
in mean BP observed in this normotensive population is unlikely to be clinically relevant or 
have a significant impact on the benefit risk profile (Module 2.5).

SVII.1.2  Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the 
RMP 
Descriptions of the initially proposed important identified and important potential risks and 
missing information for ELX/TEZ/IVA are provided herein; changes to the initially approved 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) will be captured in Section SVII.2. 
SVII.1.2.1 
Important Identified Risk – Susceptibility for influenza virus infections 
Benefit-Risk Impact  
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Study 102), a higher incidence of influenza AEs was reported in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
compared to the placebo group. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, all AEs of influenza were mild 
or moderate in severity and most were non-serious. All subjects continued ELX/TEZ/IVA 
dosing or resumed treatment after an interruption. In the open-label extension Study 105, the 
rate of influenza AEs during extended ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment was lower than the rate in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group in Study 102, and similar to the rate in the placebo group in 
Study 102. 
Based on the overall safety experience with ELX/TEZ/IVA, an association between treatment 
and influenza cannot be completely excluded. As such, susceptibility for influenza virus 
infections is considered an important identified risk. 
SVII.1.2.2 
Important Potential Risk – Hepatotoxicity 
Benefit-Risk Impact 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Study 102), a higher incidence of elevated transaminase AEs was reported in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group compared to the placebo group. In addition, the incidence of ALT 
and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) laboratory elevations >3 × upper limit of normal 
(ULN) was higher in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group. LFT elevations 
were also seen in other clinical studies with ELX/TEZ/IVA, including the open-label 
extension Study 105. 
The overall safety experience with ELX/TEZ/IVA does not suggest a causal association 
between treatment and hepatotoxicity; however, the potential for hepatotoxicity cannot be 
excluded. As such, hepatotoxicity is considered an important potential risk.  
SVII.1.2.3 
Important Potential Risk – Cataract 
Benefit-Risk Impact  
Lens opacities (cataracts) were initially identified as a potential safety concern with IVA 
based on a nonclinical study in juvenile rats but was not observed in older animals or in 
longer duration nonclinical studies.  
Non-congenital cataracts have been reported in paediatric subjects treated with 
IVA-containing regimens during clinical studies and post-authorisation surveillance. These 
reports consisted of subtle findings without any impact on vision, and the relationship of 
these events to IVA treatment is uncertain due to lack of baseline ophthalmological 
examinations, the high prevalence of background lens opacities, the subtlety of the 
ophthalmological findings, and/or other confounding risk factors. 
Overall, the available evidence in humans does not support an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development or progression; however, a contributing role cannot be 
completely excluded given the nonclinical finding. Therefore, cataracts are considered an 
important potential risk.

Page 33 of 58 
SVII.1.2.4  Missing Information – Use in Pregnant and Lactating Women 
Benefit-Risk Impact 
Nonclinical studies indicated that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are not teratogens. Additional 
nonclinical studies showed ELX, TEZ, and IVA were transferred to the placenta of pregnant 
rats and execrated into the milk of lactating rats.  
The effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on pregnancy and lactation in humans is not known as no 
clinical studies in pregnant or lactating women have been conducted. Therefore, the safety in 
this population is considered missing information and further characterisation is needed.  
SVII.1.2.5  Missing Information – Long-term Safety 
Benefit-Risk Impact 
The longest clinical study experience with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment is approximately 
69 weeks. 
As a chronic treatment, the long-term safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA is considered missing 
information and further characterisation is needed. 
SVII.1.2.6  Missing Information – Use in Patients With Moderate or Severe Hepatic 
Impairment 
Benefit-Risk Impact 
 A dedicated study (VX18-445-007 [Study 007]) has been conducted to evaluate the safety 
and PK of ELX/TEZ/IVA in 11 subjects without CF who have moderate hepatic impairment. 
Based on the preliminary results from this study, the mean AUCτ for total ELX increased 
1.25-fold, while Cmax was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to 
matched healthy subjects. Mean exposures (AUCτ and Cmax) of total M23-ELX increased 
approximately 1.7-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to matched 
healthy subjects. Mean AUCτ for total ELX+M23-ELX increased 1.36-fold, while Cmax 
increased 1.24-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to matched healthy 
subjects. 
In the controlled, Phase 3 studies (Studies 102 and 103) and the open-label extension study 
(Study 105) in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, 12 subjects with a medical history of 
portal hypertension, hepatic cirrhosis, and/or portal/hepatic fibrosis received ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment. The safety data in these 12 subjects were generally consistent with the safety data 
in other subjects treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Overall, the safety experience in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is 
limited; therefore, the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in this population is considered missing 
information. 
SVII.2  New Safety Concerns and Reclassification With a Submission of an Updated 
RMP 
SVII.2.1 
Reclassified to an Important Identified Risk – Hepatotoxicity 
Postmarketing reports of drug-induced liver injury have been received in patients treated with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, including cases of liver injury characterized by concurrent elevations of 
transaminases and bilirubin, and one case of liver failure leading to transplantation in a 
patient with pre-existing cirrhosis and portal hypertension. An association with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment cannot be excluded in these cases. As such, the important potential 
risk of “Hepatoxicity” is being reclassified to an important identified risk in the EU RMP 
Version 3.1.

SVII.2.2 
Added Missing Information – Use in children aged 6 to 11 years 
A line extension submission and a Type II variation for ELX/TEZ/IVA use in children aged 
6 to 11 years was submitted on 8 March 2021 (EMEA/H/C/5269/X/0008/G). During the 
assessment, PRAC requested that the summary of safety concerns be updated to include “Use 
in children aged 6 to 11 years” as missing information for ELX/TEZ/IVA. As such, the 
summary of safety concerns was updated to include it in EU RMP v4.0.  
SVII.3  Details of Important Identified Risks, Important Potential Risks, and Missing 
Information 
SVII.3.1  Presentation of Important Identified Risks 
SVII.3.1.1 
Important Identified Risk – Susceptibility for Influenza Virus Infections 
Potential mechanisms 
No potential mechanism has been identified.  
Influenza is one of the most common infectious illnesses worldwide. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimates that the burden of influenza illness during the 2018 to 2019 
season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million 
people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalisations, and 
34,200 deaths from influenza.63 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Study 102), a higher incidence of influenza AEs was reported in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group 
compared to the placebo group. In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, all AEs of influenza were mild 
or moderate in severity and most were non-serious. All subjects continued ELX/TEZ/IVA 
dosing or resumed treatment after an interruption. In the open-label extension Study 105, the 
rate of influenza AEs during extended ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment was lower than the rate in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group in Study 102, and similar to the rate in the placebo group in 
Study 102. 
Characterisation of the risk 
Phase 3, Controlled Studies in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled study in CF subjects who are heterozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene with a minimal function mutation (F/MF genotype) 
(Study 102), a higher incidence of influenza AEs was reported in the ELX/TEZ/IVA 
group (6.9%) compared to the placebo group (1.5%). In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, all AEs of 
influenza were mild or moderate in severity and most were non-serious; 3 (1.5%) subjects 
had AEs of influenza that were serious. All subjects with AEs of influenza continued 
ELX/TEZ/IVA dosing or resumed treatment after an interruption. 
In the 4-week, TEZ/IVA-controlled study in CF subjects who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation in the CFTR gene (F/F genotype) (VX17-445-103 [Study 103]), there were 
no AEs of influenza in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group. 
In the 8-week, IVA- and TEZ/IVA-controlled study in CF subjects who are heterozygous for 
the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene with a gating or residual function mutation (F/Gating 
or F/RF genotypes, respectively) (VX18-445-104 [Study 104]), the incidence of influenza 
AEs was balanced between the ELX/TEZ/IVA group (2 subjects [1.5%]) and the control 
group (2 subjects [1.6%]). In the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, both AEs of influenza were mild in 
severity and non-serious; neither event led to a change in ELX/TEZ/IVA dosing.

Phase 3, Open-label Extension Study in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
In the open-label extension Study 105 in CF subjects who previously completed Study 102 
(F/MF genotype) or Study 103 (F/F genotype), final results from the 192-week analysis 
showed the exposure-adjusted event rate for influenza (4.38 events/100PY) was substantially 
lower than the rate in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group of Study 102 (15.97 events/100PY). 
Additionally, the rate of influenza in Study 105 was similar to the rate in the placebo group of 
Study 102 (3.00 events/100PY). 
In Study 105, the majority of influenza AEs were mild or moderate in severity and 
non-serious; 7 (1.4%) subjects had AEs of influenza that were serious. None of the influenza 
AEs led to interruption or discontinuation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Overall, there was a lower rate of influenza AEs in the open-label extension Study 105 
compared to the parent Study 102; the nature and severity of these AEs remained consistent 
with extended ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
Phase 3 Study in subjects aged 6 to 11 years 
In the 24-week, open-label, Phase 3 Study 106 Part B in subjects aged 6 through 11 years of 
age, 7 (10.6%) subjects had AEs of influenza. All influenza AEs were mild or moderate in 
severity, and none were serious or led to treatment interruption or discontinuation. 
Overall, results relevant to influenza from Study 106 Part B were generally consistent with 
the results from the prior studies in subjects ≥12 years of age (Studies 102 and 103).  
Phase 3, Open-label Extension Study in CF Subjects 6 Years of Age and Older 
In the open-label extension Study 107 in CF subjects who previously completed Study 106, 
results from the 96-week analysis showed the exposure-adjusted event rate for influenza 
(0.79 events/100PY) was substantially lower than the rate in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group of 
Study 106 (23.16 events/100PY).  
In Study 107, there was only 1 AE of influenza which was mild in severity and non-serious, 
which did not lead to Interruption or discontinuation of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment.  
Overall, there was a lower rate of influenza AEs in the open-label extension Study 107 
compared to the parent Study 106; the nature and severity of these AEs remained consistent 
with extended ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients who are hospitalised frequently or for long-term durations are at a greater risk for 
contracting influenza from other infected individuals. Risk factors for influenza-related 
complications include common CF comorbidities (e.g., chronic lung disease, asthma) and a 
compromised immune system.  
Preventability 
The most effective way to prevent influenza is to get an annual vaccination. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product 
Given the broad (pulmonary and systemic) clinical benefits demonstrated with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, and the generally mild to moderate nature of the influenza AEs 
observed in clinical studies, this risk is not expected to significantly impact the benefit-risk 
balance.  
Influenza is listed as an adverse drug reaction in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. This risk is closely 
monitored to assess the appropriateness of the current pharmacovigilance plan and risk 
minimisation measures.

Public health impact 
No public health impact is anticipated.  
SVII.3.1.2 
Important Identified Risk – Hepatotoxicity 
Potential mechanisms 
ELX, TEZ, and IVA are primarily metabolised by liver enzymes; however, the exact 
mechanism of the effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on LFTs is not presently known.  
Common comorbidities in patients with CF and use of certain concomitant medications may 
contribute to the increase in LFTs. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study in CF subjects 12 years of age and older 
(Study 102), the incidence of elevated transaminase events (AEs or ALT/AST laboratory 
elevations >3 × ULN) was higher in the group of subjects treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA than in 
the group of subjects receiving placebo. LFT elevations were also seen in other clinical 
studies with ELX/TEZ/IVA, including the open-label extension Study 105. 
In addition, postmarketing reports of drug-induced liver injury have been received in patients 
treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA, including cases of liver injury characterized by concurrent 
elevations of transaminases and bilirubin, and one case of liver failure leading to 
transplantation in a patient with pre-existing cirrhosis and portal hypertension An association 
with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment cannot be excluded in these cases. 
Characterisation of the risk 
Phase 3, Controlled Studies in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled study in CF patients 12 years of age and older who have 
an F/MF genotype (Study 102), elevated transaminase AEs occurred at a higher incidence in 
the ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group (10.9% versus 4.0%, respectively). The 
majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity and associated with ALT/AST 
elevations <5 × ULN. 
There were no elevated transaminase events that led to treatment discontinuation. 
Two (1.0%) subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 3 (1.5%) subjects in the placebo group 
had elevated transaminase events that led to treatment interruption: 1 of the subjects in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group resumed treatment; the other subject enrolled in the open-label 
extension study (Study 105) while still on study drug interruption and eventually 
discontinued from that study without resuming study drug. 
No subjects in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group and 1 subject (0.5%) in the placebo group had a 
serious elevated transaminase event. 
The incidence of ALT/AST laboratory elevations >3 × ULN was higher in the 
ELX/TEZ/IVA group than in the placebo group (7.9% versus 5.5%, respectively), while the 
incidences of ALT/AST >5 × ULN and >8 × ULN were generally comparable between 
treatment groups (2.5% and 1.5% in the ELX/TEZ/IVA group, respectively, versus 1.5% and 
1.0% in the placebo group). 
No subject had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN concurrent with a newly occurring 
elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
Results relevant to LFT assessment from studies in CF subjects who have F/F genotype 
(Study 103) or who have an F/Gating or F/RF genotype (Study 104) were generally 
consistent with those from Study 102.

Phase 3, Open-label Extension Study in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
In the open-label extension Study 105 in CF subjects who previously completed Study 102 
(F/MF genotype) or Study 103 (F/F genotype), final results from the 192-week analysis  
showed the exposure-adjusted event rate for elevated transaminase AEs was lower in Study 
105 than in the Study 102 ELX/TEZ/IVA group (10.07 and 42.92 events/100PY, 
respectively). Additionally, the severity and magnitude of the ALT/AST elevations associated 
with these AEs in Study 105 were similar to those in the parent studies.  
Elevated transaminase events led to treatment interruption in 21 (4.2%) subjects and led to 
treatment discontinuation in 7 (1.4%) subjects.  
One subject who discontinued study drug treatment due to a SAE of hepatic encephalopathy 
had a history of CF hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension, gastric varices, and 
thrombocytopenia. The investigator assessed the SAE of hepatic encephalopathy as related to 
study drug treatment; however, the subject’s underlying CF liver disease is a significant 
confounding factor. Given the long latency from initiation of study drug to the onset of the 
SAE (approximately 9 months), and the lack of significant changes in both LFTs and 
synthetic liver function (e.g., albumin, international normalised ratio), this event may be due 
to natural progression of the subject’s pre-existing cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 
The incidence of subjects with maximum on-treatment transaminase elevations (ALT and/or 
AST) above thresholds of >3 ×, >5 ×, and >8 × ULN were 12.5%, 7.1% and 2.2%, 
respectively.  
Two (0.4%) subjects had elevations of ALT or AST >3 × ULN concurrent with a newly 
occurring elevation in total bilirubin >2 × ULN.  
Overall, results relevant to LFT assessment from open-label extension Study 105 were 
generally consistent with the results from the parent studies (Studies 102 and 103). 
Phase 3 Study in subjects aged 6 to 11 years 
In the 24-week, open-label, Phase 3 Study 106 Part B in subjects aged 6 through 11 years of 
age, 7 (10.6%) subjects had elevated transaminase events. All of the events were mild or 
moderate in severity, and none were serious or led to treatment discontinuation or 
interruption. Seven (10.6%) subjects had ALT or AST >3 × ULN, and 1 (1.5%) subject had 
ALT or AST >5 × ULN; no subjects had ALT or AST >8 × ULN. The majority of subjects 
had bilirubin values that remained within the normal range; no subjects had total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN. 
Overall, results relevant to LFT assessment from Study 106 Part B were generally consistent 
with the results from the prior studies in subjects ≥12 years of age (Studies 102 and 103).  
Phase 3, Open-label Extension Study in CF Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older 
Results from the first 96 weeks of treatment in open-label extension Study 107 evaluating 
subjects aged 6 years and older were generally consistent with those seen in Study 102 and 
parent Study 106. AEs of elevated transaminases occurred in 6 (9.4%) subjects, none of 
which required treatment interruption or discontinuation. The majority of events were mild in 
severity. Elevation of ALT or AST >3, >5, and >8 × ULN occurred in 4 (6.3%), 1 (1.6%), 
and 0 subject(s), respectively. No subjects had elevation of ALT or AST >3 × ULN 
concurrent with newly occurred elevation of total bilirubin >2 × ULN. 
Overall, results relevant to LFT assessment from open-label extension Study 107 were 
generally consistent with the results from the Parent Study 106.

Postmarketing Experience 
Postmarketing reports of drug-induced liver injury have been received in patients treated with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA, including cases of liver injury characterized by concurrent elevations of 
transaminases and bilirubin, and one case of liver failure leading to transplantation in a 
patient with pre-existing cirrhosis and portal hypertension. An association with 
ELX/TEZ/ICA treatment cannot be excluded in these cases.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Generally known risk factors for increases in transaminases include concurrent acute and 
chronic infections or illnesses (e.g., pulmonary exacerbation, flu-like illness, viral hepatitis), 
comorbidities (e.g., CF liver disease), and use of concomitant drugs (e.g., acetaminophen, 
antibiotics) or substances (alcohol) known to be associated with liver enzyme elevations. 
Patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis and portal hypertension) may 
be at an increased risk of developing severe liver injury such as liver failure requiring 
transplantation.   
Preventability 
Appropriate monitoring of LFTs and drug interruptions or discontinuations are the standard 
measures to detect and prevent drug-induced liver injury. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product 
Elevated transaminases with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment were generally transient and resolved 
without long-term sequelae. Very high levels of transaminase elevations or transaminase 
elevations with concurrent total bilirubin elevation may be a sign of liver injury which could 
become permanent or be life-threatening. There is also the risk of more severe liver injury 
including liver injury leading to transplant in patients with underlying advanced liver disease.  
Given the broad (pulmonary and systemic) clinical benefits demonstrated with 
ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment, the the rarity of cases of liver injury, and the monitorability of 
LFTs in clinical practice, and the guidance regarding risks in patients with underlying 
advanced liver disease, this risk is not expected to significantly impact the benefit-risk 
balance.  
The identified risk of hepatotoxicity is described in the product information, along with 
recommendations for LFT monitoring in all patients and more frequent monitoring in patients 
with a history of elevated transaminases or underlying liver disease. This risk is closely 
monitored to assess the appropriateness of the current pharmacovigilance plan and risk 
minimisation measures. 
Public health impact 
No public health impact is anticipated. 
SVII.3.2  Presentation of Important Potential Risks 
SVII.3.2.1 
Important Potential Risk – Cataract 
Potential mechanisms 
The aetiology for the observation of IVA-induced cataracts in juvenile rats (without evidence 
of cataracts after chronic dosing in adult rats) is unknown; however, it is likely related to 
factors specific to the development of lens tissues in the eye of albino rats. One hypothesis to 
explain this observation relates to factors unique to the developing lens in newborn albino 
rats and, in particular, the developing vasculature, namely the hyaloids vessels. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Cataracts (lens opacities) considered related to IVA treatment were seen during studies in 
newborn rats but were not observed in older animals or in longer duration animal studies. 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited 
 
 
 
 
 
 
KAFTRIO (ELX/TEZ/IVA) Risk Management Plan    
Page 39 of 58 
Given developmental differences between rats and humans, it is unlikely that the cataract 
finding is relevant to humans 6 years of age and older. 
Non-congenital cataracts without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric subjects 
treated with IVA-containing regimens during clinical studies and post-authorisation 
surveillance, but the relationship of these events to treatment is uncertain due to the presence 
of other possible causes.  
Characterisation of the risk 
Lens opacities (cataracts) were initially identified as a potential safety concern with IVA 
based on a nonclinical study in juvenile rats but was not observed in older animals or in 
longer duration nonclinical studies.  
In humans, a small number of non-congenital cataract events were reported in paediatric 
subjects treated with IVA-containing regimens from clinical studies and post-authorisation 
surveillance. However, the relationship of these events to IVA is uncertain due to lack of 
baseline ophthalmological examinations, the high prevalence of background lens opacities, 
the subtlety of the ophthalmological findings, and the presence of other confounding risk 
factors (e.g., corticosteroid use, history of uncontrolled diabetes). In addition, results from an 
ocular safety study with IVA monotherapy showed a lack of cataract progression in patients 
treated with IVA monotherapy based on the Lens Opacity Classification System, Version III 
grading. 
Ophthalmologic examinations are routinely conducted in the ELX/TEZ/IVA trials in subjects 
aged <18 years on the date of informed consent signing. In the long-term extension Study 
105 in subjects aged 12 years and older, final results from the 192-week analysis showed 
3 (0.6%) subjects had an AE of cataract, and 2 (0.4%) subjects had an AE of cataract cortical. 
All events were mild or moderate in severity, nonserious, and assessed by the investigator as 
related or possibly related to study drug. None of the events required treatment or led to study 
drug interruption or discontinuation. Results from the first 96 weeks of treatment in open-
label extension Study 107 evaluating subjects aged 6 years and older showed 6 (9.4%) 
subjects had events related to lenticular opacity or cataracts; three subjects had AEs of 
lenticular opacities. Three subjects had AEs of cataracts (1 subject each had AEs of cataract, 
cataract cortical, and cataract nuclear). All 3 AEs were mild, were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly related to study drug and did not require treatment or lead to 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug.  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk factors for cataracts include aging, trauma, UV light and radiation exposure, diabetes 
mellitus, intraocular inflammation, and corticosteroid use.64-67 
Preventability 
The preventability of cataracts is unknown.  
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product 
Overall, the available evidence in humans does not support an association between IVA 
treatment and cataract development or progression, although a contributing role cannot be 
completely excluded given the nonclinical finding. Given the subtlety of the clinical cataract 
findings, this potential risk is not expected to have a significant impact on the benefit risk 
balance for ELX/TEZ/IVA. 
The potential effect on cataracts is described in the product information, including a 
recommendation for baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations in paediatric 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited

patients. This risk is closely monitored to assess the appropriateness of the current 
pharmacovigilance plan and risk minimisation measures.  
Public health impact 
No public health impact is anticipated.  
SVII.3.3  Presentation of the Missing Information 
SVII.3.3.1  Missing Information – Use in Pregnant and Lactating Women 
Evidence source 
Nonclinical studies indicated that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are not teratogens. Additional 
nonclinical studies showed ELX, TEZ, and IVA were transferred to the placenta of pregnant 
rats and excreted into the milk of lactating rats.  
The effect of ELX/TEZ/IVA on pregnancy and lactation in humans is not known as no 
clinical studies in pregnant or lactating women have been conducted.  
Population in need of further characterisation 
The safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in pregnant and lactating women will be further 
characterised in the post-authorisation setting. 
SVII.3.3.2  Missing Information – Long-term Safety 
Evidence source 
The longest clinical study experience with ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment is approximately 
216 weeks.  
Population in need of further characterisation 
Long-term safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment remains under ongoing evaluation in clinical 
studies and post-authorisation surveillance. 
Characterization of the Risk  
Final results from 192 weeks of treatment in the long-term extension Study 105 showed that 
ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated in subjects aged 12 years and older. The 
safety profile was consistent with that of the parent studies 102/103 and with the established 
safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA; no new safety concerns were identified. 
Results from 96 weeks of treatment in the long-term extension Study 107 (subjects aged 
6 years and older) showed that ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated. The 
safety profile was consistent with that of the parent Study 106 and with the established safety 
profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA; no new safety concerns were identified. 
SVII.3.3.3  Missing Information – Use in Patients With Moderate or Severe Hepatic 
Impairment 
Evidence source 
A dedicated study (Study 007) has been conducted to evaluate the safety and PK of 
ELX/TEZ/IVA in 11 subjects without CF who have moderate hepatic impairment. Based on 
the final results from this study, the mean AUCτ for total ELX increased 1.25-fold, while 
Cmax was similar in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to 11 matched healthy 
subjects. Mean exposures (AUCτ and Cmax) of total M23-ELX increased approximately 
1.7-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to matched healthy subjects. 
Mean AUCτ for total ELX+M23-ELX increased 1.36-fold, while Cmax increased 1.24-fold in 
subjects with moderate hepatic impairment relative to matched healthy subjects. The 
exposures of TEZ, IVA and their respective metabolites were generally consistent with 
studies conducted previously. Overall, ELX/TEZ/IVA administered for 10 days was 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) Limited 
 
 
 
 
 
 
KAFTRIO (ELX/TEZ/IVA) Risk Management Plan    
Page 41 of 58 
generally safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and matched 
healthy subjects. 
In the controlled, Phase 3 studies (Studies 102 and 103) and the open-label extension study 
(Study 105) in CF subjects 12 years of age and older, 12 subjects with a medical history of 
portal hypertension, hepatic cirrhosis, and/or portal/hepatic fibrosis received ELX/TEZ/IVA 
treatment. The safety data in these 12 subjects were generally consistent with the safety data 
in other subjects treated with ELX/TEZ/IVA.  
Population in need of further characterisation  
Overall, the safety experience in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is 
limited; therefore, the use of ELX/TEZ/IVA in this population is considered missing 
information.  
SVII.3.3.4  Missing Information – Use in Children Aged 6 to 11 Years 
Evidence source  
The 24-week, uncontrolled Phase 3 Study 106 Part B in subjects aged 6 through 11 years of 
age, treatment with ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well-tolerated, and the safety 
results were consistent with the known safety profile. However, the study had a relatively 
small sample size of 66 subjects, and the overall safety experience is still limited. Therefore, 
the safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA in this age group will need further characterization.  
Population in need of further characterisation  
Safety of ELX/TEZ/IVA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years remains under ongoing 
evaluation in post-authorisation surveillance. Results from the long-term extension Study 107 
showed that ELX/TEZ/IVA was generally safe and well tolerated for 96 weeks of treatment 
in subjects aged 6 years and older. The safety profile was consistent with that of the parent 
study 106 and with the established safety profile of ELX/TEZ/IVA; no new safety concerns 
were identified.

PART VI Summary of the RMP 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for KAFTRIO (Elexacaftor in Combination With 
Tezacaftor and Ivacaftor) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for KAFTRIO when used in a 
combination regimen with ivacaftor 75mg or 150 mg tablets. The RMP details important 
risks of KAFTRIO, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be 
obtained about KAFTRIO’s risks and uncertainties (missing information) when used in 
combination with ivacaftor. 
KAFTRIO’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how KAFTRIO should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for KAFTRIO should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new safety concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
KAFTRIO’s RMP.

I. The medicine and what it is used for 
KAFTRIO in a combination regimen with ivacaftor (75 or 150 mg tablets) is authorised for 
the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one 
F508del mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see SmPC 
for the full indication). It contains elexacaftor in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor as 
the active substances and it is given orally.  
Further information about the evaluation of KAFTRIO’s benefits when used in combination 
with ivacaftor can be found in KAFTRIO’s EPAR, including its plain-language summary, 
available on the EMA website under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kaftrio.  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks 
Important risks of KAFTRIO when used in combination with ivacaftor, together with 
measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about 
KAFTRIO’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of KAFTRIO in combination with 
ivacaftor is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of KAFTRIO in combination with ivacaftor are risks that need special risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal 
product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
KAFTRIO. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the 
medicine).

1.  Introduction 
On the 14th May 2019, the MAH submitted the final study report, including 6-month safety follow-up 
data, for the study Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 2016-000598-19) to comply with the 
requirements of Art 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
Rota-081 is a phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical 
consistency of 3 production lots of the Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of 
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’(GSK) oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate 
the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK’s HRV vaccine as compared to the currently licensed lyophilised 
formulation of the HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when 
administered as a 2-dose vaccination in healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks. Note that ‘PCV-
free’ is defined as no detection of PCV-1 and PCV-2 according to the limit of detection of the tests 
used’. 
A short critical expert overview is also provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
GSK has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of Study Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 
2016-000598-19) to comply with the requirements of Art 46 of the regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
GSK plans to submit a Type II variation, composed of quality and clinical sections, to license the PCV-
free manufacturing process of Rotarix and to meet the last part of the condition of the Rotarix 
Marketing Authorisation (EU Product Information Annex II, Part D, Obligation to conduct post-
authorisation measures): 
“In order to address the presence of porcine circovirus type 1(PCV-1) in Rotarix, the MAH commits to: 
- 
Provide, on a 6-month basis, updates on the progress being made on the activities set out in 
the implementation plan for the development of a PCV-free vaccine, as agreed by CHMP on 15 
September 2016: every June and December until the PCVfree Rotarix application.Submit an 
application at the latest in 2020 to amend the particulars of the marketing authorisation in 
order to render the medicinal product PCV-free”. 
The Rota-081 study results will be part of this variation to demonstrate the clinical comparability 
between the current and PCV-free Rotarix vaccines, on top of the technical comparability data.

Rota-081 (etrack 115461, EudraCT 2016-000598-19) 
Description 
A phase IIIA, randomised, observer-blind, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical consistency of 3 
production lots of the Porcine circovirus (PCV)-free liquid formulation of GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals’(GSK) oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine and to evaluate the PCV-free 
liquid formulation of GSK’s HRV vaccine as compared to the currently licensed lyophilised formulation 
of the HRV vaccine in terms of immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety when administered as a 2-
dose vaccination in healthy infants starting at age 6-12 weeks.  
The study was conducted at 66 centres in 8 countries: 2 in Costa Rica, 10 in Finland, 6 in Germany, 7 
in Japan, 6 in Republic of Korea, 9 in Spain, 6 in Taiwan and 20 in the US. 
Methods 
Objectives 
Co-Primary objectives : 
To  d e m o n s t r a t e  t h e  lo t -to-lot consistency of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine in terms of 
immunogenicity as measured by serum anti-rotavirus (RV) immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody 
concentrations 1-2 months after Dose 2. 
Consistency was demonstrated if, for all pairs of lots, the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), 1-2 months after Dose 2, was 
within the (0.5, 2) clinical limit interval. 
To  d e m o n s t r a t e  t h e  im m u n o lo g ic a l n o n- inferiority of PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine as compared to the 
currently licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of seroconversion rates 1-2 months after Dose 2. 
Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided asymptotic standardised 95% CI for 
the difference in seroconversion rate between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid 
groups) and licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine was greater than or equal to -10%. 
To  d e m o n s t r a t e  t h e  n o n- inferiority of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine to that of the currently 
licensed lyophilised HRV vaccine in terms of serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations 1-2 months 
after Dose 2.  
Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA 
antibody GMCs, 1-2 months after Dose 2 between the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid 
groups) and the lyophilised HRV vaccine was greater than or equal to 0.67.

 Parents/legally acceptable representatives (LARs) were instructed to collect stool sample(s) if the 
subject developed GE during this period. A stool sample had to be collected as soon as possible 
after illness began and preferably not later than 7 days after the start of GE symptoms. Two 
occurrences of diarrhoea were classified as separate episodes if there were 5 or more diarrhoea-free 
days between the episodes.

 S a fe t y  m o n it o r in g :  An  I n d e p e n d e n t  Da t a  Mo n it o r in g  Co m m it t e e  ( I DMC)  c o m p r is in g  clinical experts 
and a biostatistician, reviewed the cumulative, unblinded safety data on a regular basis during the 
study. Since no safety concerns were raised, the study continued as planned. 
Number of subjects (planned and analysed): 
The target enrolment was 1600 subjects (400 subjects in each group) to obtain at least 1280 evaluable 
subjects (320 subjects in each group) for the evaluation of the co-primary objectives, assuming that 
approximately 20% of the enrolled subjects were not evaluable. The actual number of subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of HRV vaccine was 1600 (400 subjects in Liq_A, 396 subjects in Liq_B, 402 
subjects in Liq_C and 402 subjects in Lyo groups), comprising the Exposed set (ES). 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
The study was conducted in healthy male or female infants as established by medical history and 
clinical examination, who were 6-12 weeks of age at the time of first vaccination, born full-term (i.e. 
between a gestation period of 37 weeks 0 days and 41 weeks 6 days). Written informed consent was 
obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects at the time of study entry.  
Exclusion criteria essentially consisted of administration of vaccines not foreseen by the study protocol, 
previous vaccination against RV, administration of immunoglobulins, immune-modifying drugs or 
immunosuppressant medications, a potential reaction or hypersensitivity to the HRV vaccine 
components and significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease or uncorrected gastrointestinal 
malformation or intussusception (IS). Subjects with previous confirmed occurrence of RV GE or with 
GE within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration were excluded. 
Duration of study: 
The duration of the study, per subject, was approximately 7-8 months including the 6 months of 
extended safety follow-up period after the last dose of HRV vaccine. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Primary endpoints 
 Evaluation of immunogenicity in terms of anti-RV antibody concentrations. 
 Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations expressed as GMCs 1-2 months 
after Dose 2 in each of the HRV liquid formulation groups (Liq_A, Liq_B and 
Liq_C). 
 Anti-RV IgA antibody seroconversion rate* 1-2 months after Dose 2 in the 
lyophilised and pooled liquid groups. 
 Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations expressed as GMCs 1-2 months 
after Dose 2 in the lyophilised and pooled liquid groups.  
*Seroconversion rate is defined as the percentage of subjects who were initially 
seronegative (i.e. with anti-RV IgA antibody concentration <20 U/mL prior the first 
dose of HRV vaccine) and developed anti-RV IgA antibody concentration ≥20 U/mL at 
Visit 3.

Secondary endpoints 
 Solicited AEs 
 Occurrence of each solicited general AE within the 8 days (Day 1-Day 8) 
follow-up period after each dose of the lyophilised and PCV-free HRV liquid 
vaccine 
 Unsolicited AEs. 
 Occurrence of unsolicited AEs within 31 days (Day 1-Day 31) after any dose 
of HRV vaccine, according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) classification. 
 SAEs 
 Occurrence of SAEs from Dose 1 up to study end. 
 Evaluation of immunogenicity in terms of anti-RV antibody concentrations. 
 Serum anti-RV IgA antibody concentrations ≥90 U/mL 1-2 months after 
Dose 2in the lyophilised and pooled liquid groups. 
Statistical methods: 
Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol amendment 1 (dated 9 March 2017) and the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) Amendment 1 (dated 5 February 2018). 
Analysis sets 
 ES 
 Per-protocol analysis set (PPS) of immunogenicity 
Analysis of immunogenicity 
The primary analysis was based on the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity. As the percentage of 
vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the PPS for analysis of immunogenicity was 
5% or more, a second analysis based on the ES was performed to complement the PPS analysis. 
Between groups assessment 
To control risk of concluding erroneously due to the multiple co-primary objectives, a hierarchical 
procedure was used with a 2.5% type I error. 
 The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between any pair of the 3 lots of 
the HRV liquid vaccine was computed (first co-primary objective). 
 The asymptotic standardised 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 between the 
PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and lyophilised HRV vaccine was computed 
(second co-primary objective conclusive only if the first co-primary objective was reached).

 The 95% CI for the ratio of anti-RV IgA antibody GMCs at Visit 3 between the PCV-free liquid HRV 
vaccine (pooled HRV liquid groups) and lyophilised HRV vaccine was computed (third co-primary 
objective conclusive only if the second co-primary objective was reached). 
Analysis of safety 
The ES was used for the analysis of safety. Descriptive summaries were generated via the percentage 
by group and associated exact 95% CI. Further details on the statistical methods and derivations are 
available in the SAP.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This phase IIIA, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multi-country study demonstrated the lot-to-
lot consistency of 3 production lots of the PCV-free liquid formulation of GSK’s oral live attenuated HRV 
vaccine and its non-inferiority compared to current licensed lyophilised formulation in terms of 
immunogenicity.  
In addition, the study showed that the administration of PCV-free liquid and current licensed 
lyophilised formulation did not raise any safety concerns and that PCV-free liquid and current licensed 
lyophilised formulation have a similar reactogenicity and safety profile.  
The Assessor has reviewed the immunogenicity and safety results of Study Rota-081 based on the 
dossier submitted and has concluded that the data do not influence the benefit-risk balance and are in 
line with the approved Product Information for Rotarix in the EU. Therefore, no changes to the current 
SmPC i.e. Annex I of the EU Product Information, for Rotarix are considered necessary. 
<Rapporteur’s><CHMP> overall conclusion and recommendation 
1 Serious Adverse Event: Intussusception 
Subject received 2 doses of the PCV-free liquid HRV vaccine. At 8 months of age, 132 days after receiving the second dose 
of vaccination, the subject experienced frequent vomiting, and was hospitalised the following day. The subject was 
diagnosed with moderate IS (Grade 2 SAE). The subject was treated with high-pressure enema, followed by intravenous 
administration of a combination of glucose, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, sodium lactate, and a combination of 
calcium chloride, glucose, potassium chloride, sodium acetate, and sodium chloride. The subject was discharged from the

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Axumin 1,600 MBq/mL solution for injection 
Axumin 3,200 MBq/mL solution for injection 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Axumin 1,600 MBq/mL solution for injection 
Each mL of solution contains 1,600 MBq of fluciclovine (18F) at the date and time of calibration 
(ToC).  
The activity per vial ranges from 1,600 MBq to 16,000 MBq at the date and ToC.  
Axumin 3,200 MBq/mL solution for injection 
Each mL of solution contains 3,200 MBq of fluciclovine (18F) at the date and ToC.  
The activity per vial ranges from 3,200 MBq to 32,000 MBq at the date and ToC.  
Fluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of 110 minutes by emitting a positronic 
radiation of maximum energy of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV.  
Excipients with known effect  
Each mL of solution contains 7.7 mg of sodium.  
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Axumin is indicated for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to detect recurrence of prostate 
cancer in adult men with a suspected recurrence based on elevated blood prostate specific antigen 
(PSA) levels after primary curative treatment. 
For the limitations in the interpretation of a positive scan, see section 4.4 and 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
A PET scan with fluciclovine (18F) should be administered by appropriately qualified healthcare 
professionals. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Images should only be interpreted by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with 
fluciclovine (18F). 
Posology 
The recommended activity for an adult is 370 MBq fluciclovine (18F). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment required. 
Renal and hepatic impairment  
Axumin has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible in these patients. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of fluciclovine (18F) in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
Axumin is for intravenous use.  
The activity of fluciclovine (18F) has to be measured with an activimeter immediately prior to 
injection. 
Axumin should be administered as a bolus intravenous injection. The recommended maximum volume 
of injection of undiluted Axumin is 5 mL. Axumin may be diluted with sodium chloride 9 mg/ml 
(0.9%) solution for injection by a factor of 8. The injection should be followed by an intravenous flush 
of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure full delivery of the dose. 
Axumin is for multidose use. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4. 
Image acquisition 
The patient should be positioned supine with arms above the head. A computed tomography (CT) scan 
should be obtained for attenuation correction and anatomic correlation. PET scanning should begin 
from 3-5 minutes (target 4 minutes) after completion of the injection; an acquisition time of 3 minutes 
per bed position is recommended. Increasing the duration of acquisition over the pelvis may increase 
the sensitivity of detection of disease. It is recommended that image acquisition should start from mid-
thigh and proceed to the base of the skull. Typical total scan time is between 20-30 minutes. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Individual benefit/risk justification  
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity 
administered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required 
diagnostic information.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PSA value may affect the diagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) PET (see section 5.1, 
Pharmacodynamic properties). 
Renal impairment  
Careful consideration of the benefit/risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible.  
Paediatric population 
For information on use in the paediatric population, see section 4.2. 
Patient preparation  
It should be recommended to the patient that they do not undertake any significant exercise for at least 
a day before the fluciclovine (18F) scan. 
Prior to administration of fluciclovine (18F), patients should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours (other 
than small amounts of water for taking medicinal products).   
In order to mitigate the quantity and intensity of early excretion into the bladder, which may mask or 
mimic local prostate cancer recurrence, patients should be informed that they may void at the latest 
60 minutes before injection of fluciclovine (18F), and should then refrain from voiding until after the 
scan has been completed. 
Interpretation of fluciclovine (18F) images and limitations of use 
Fluciclovine (18F) images should be interpreted by appropriately trained personnel.  
PET images with fluciclovine (18F) should be interpreted visually. Suspicion of cancer in sites typical 
for prostate cancer recurrence is based on fluciclovine (18F) uptake in comparison with tissue 
background. For small lesions (<1 cm diameter) focal uptake greater than blood pool should be 
considered suspicious for cancer. For larger lesions, uptake equal to or greater than bone marrow is 
considered suspicious for cancer. 
The impact of quantitative/semiquantitative measurement of fluciclovine (18F) uptake as an aid to 
image interpretation has not been assessed. 
Image interpretation errors can occur with PET with fluciclovine (18F) (see section 5.1).   
Fluciclovine (18F) uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer, 
prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. False-positive cases have been also described in 
association with an inflammatory response after cryotherapy and radiation artefacts in patients 
previously treated with radiotherapy. Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological 
evaluation of the suspected recurrence site, should be considered where appropriate. 
The use of either intravenous iodinated CT contrast or oral contrast media is not required to interpret 
fluciclovine (18F) PET images. 
The detection of prostate cancer recurrence in prostate/prostate bed, regional lymph nodes, bone, soft 
tissue and non-regional lymph nodes by fluciclovine (18F) PET has been reported.  
Diagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) to detect recurrences has not been investigated in patients 
with a suspected recurrence based on elevated blood PSA levels after primary radical treatment with a 
recent positive whole-body bone scintigraphy. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After the procedure  
The patient should be encouraged to drink sufficient amounts and void as often as possible during the 
first hours after the scan in order to reduce radiation exposure of the bladder. 
Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 12 hours 
following the injection.  
Specific warnings  
This medicinal product contains up to 39 mg sodium in each injected dose, equivalent to 2% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2g sodium for an adult.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
The impact of anti-mitotic agents and colony stimulating factors on uptake of fluciclovine in patients 
with prostate cancer has not been studied. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Fluciclovine (18F) is not indicated for use in women. 
Fertility 
No studies on fertility have been performed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Axumin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 8.2 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 
370 MBq is administered these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low probability.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions were reported commonly (â‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) during clinical studies.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with fluciclovine (18F) the absorbed dose to the 
patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the 
body by forced diuresis, frequent micturition and defecation. It might be helpful to estimate the 
effective dose that was applied. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals 
for tumour detection, ATC code: V09IX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Fluciclovine (18F) is a synthetic amino acid which is transported across mammalian cell membranes by 
amino acid transporters such as LAT-1 and ASCT2. The activities of LAT-1 and ASCT2 are known to 
be upregulated in prostate cancer, providing a mechanism for the enhanced accumulation of 
fluciclovine (18F) in prostate cancer.  
A quantitative correlation between fluciclovine uptake and enhanced fluciclovine influx into cells was 
not assessed in vivo in healthy volunteers or prostate cancer patients. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, fluciclovine (18F) does not appear to 
have any pharmacodynamic activity.   
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The pivotal efficacy data derives from 115 patients recruited into the BED-001 study at Emory 
University. Patients were adult and elderly men presenting with suspected recurrence, based on 
elevated blood PSA levels after primary curative treatment of localised prostate cancer and with 
negative bone scintigraphy. Patients with non-surgical therapy were treated at least 2 years before. 
Fluciclovine (18F) PET-CT was restricted to the abdomino-pelvic region. 
Histopathology standard of truth data was available for 99 of the 115 subjects. Histological assessment 
of extraprostatic sites (either regional lymph nodes or distant sites) was only conducted for sites with 
positive image findings. 
The diagnostic performance of fluciclovine (18F) PET-CT for the detection of recurrence overall (at 
any location), and in 3 different locations (prostate/bed, pelvic lymph nodes, and distant metastases) is 
shown in Table 1. Distant metastases involved distal lymph nodes, soft tissue and bone.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Axumin in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in diagnosis of amino acid metabolism in 
solid tumours (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Fluciclovine (18F) distributes immediately following administration to the liver (14% of administered 
activity), pancreas (3%), lung (7%), red bone marrow (12%) and heart wall (4%).  
Fluciclovine is not incorporated into proteins. Fluciclovine is not metabolised in vivo. 
Organ uptake 
Fluciclovine (18F) accumulates in prostate cancer and other types of cancer but also in normal tissues 
and some other prostate pathologies (such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, high 
grade prostatic intraepithelial hyperplasia). In addition, fluciclovine uptake may be increased by an 
inflammatory reaction to recent radiotherapy or cryotherapy. 
Fluciclovine (18F) is preferentially taken up into prostate cancer cells compared with surrounding 
normal tissues. Uptake by tumours is rapid, with the highest tumour-to-normal tissue contrast between 
4 and 10 minutes after injection and continuing for around 30 minutes, with a 61% reduction in mean 
tumour uptake at 90 minutes after injection. 
Washout of activity from most organs and tissues (with the exception of the pancreas) is slow. 
Activity in the brain is low. With increasing time post injection, distributed uptake is apparent and is 
mostly associated with skeletal muscle. Washout of 18F activity from the blood is such that about half 
of the maximum 18F concentration in blood is reached by about 1 hour after administration. 
Elimination 
The major route of elimination is via the renal pathway. Urinary excretion is slow, reaching 
approximately 3% of administered radioactivity within 4 hours and 5% within 24 hours. 
Half-life  
The effective half-life of fluciclovine (18F) equates to the radioactive half-life of fluorine (18F), which 
is approximately 110 minutes.  
Renal/Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised. 
In in vitro studies, fluciclovine (18F) was not taken up by common drug transporters indicating a 
negligible potential for medicinal product interactions. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxicological studies with rats and dogs have demonstrated that with a single intravenous injection no 
deaths were observed. Toxicity with repeated administration of up to 1000 mcg/kg/day over 14 days in 
rats and dogs was not observed. This medicinal product is not intended for regular or continuous 
administration. Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
General warning  
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the vial is compromised it 
should not be used.  
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.   
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you are given this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Axumin 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Axumin is and what it is used for 
This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. 
Axumin contains the active substance fluciclovine (18F) and is given so that doctors can perform a 
special type of scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. If you have previously had 
treatment for prostate cancer and information from other tests (e.g. prostate specific antigen, PSA) 
indicates that the cancer may have returned, an Axumin PET scan can help your doctor find the 
locations where the cancer has come back.  
You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. 
The use of Axumin does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the 
nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the benefit of this procedure with the 
radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to radiation.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Axumin 
Axumin must not be used 
- 
if you are allergic to fluciclovine (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before you are given Axumin if you: 
- 
- 
have kidney problems 
are on a low sodium diet (see section "Axumin contains sodium"). 
Before administration of Axumin you: 
- 
- 
should avoid exercise for at least a day before the Axumin scan. 
should not eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan (you can take your usual medicines 
with small amounts of water).   
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
may urinate at the latest 60 minutes before the Axumin injection and you should avoid urination 
until after the scan has been completed. 
Children and adolescents 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor if you are under 18 years old. Axumin is not intended for use in 
children and adolescents aged under 18 years. 
Other medicines and Axumin  
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines since they may interfere with the interpretation of the images. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is not indicated for use in women. 
Driving and using machines  
It is considered unlikely that Axumin will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Axumin contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 39 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This 
is equivalent to 2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
3. 
How to use Axumin 
There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products.  
Axumin will only be used in specially controlled areas. This medicine will only be handled and given 
to you by people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for 
the safe use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions.  
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of Axumin to be 
used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. The 
quantity to be administered usually recommended for an adult is 370 MBq (megabecquerel, the unit 
used to express radioactivity). 
Administration of Axumin and conduct of the procedure  
Axumin is administered intravenously as an injection into your vein followed by a flush of sodium 
chloride solution to ensure that you receive the full dose.  
One injection is usually sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. 
Duration of the procedure  
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. The scan will 
usually start approximately 5 minutes after the Axumin injection is given. 
After administration of Axumin you should:  
- 
avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 12 hours following 
the injection 
urinate frequently in order to eliminate the product from your body. 
- 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions.  
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have been given more Axumin than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Axumin precisely controlled by 
the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. However, in the case of an overdose, you will 
receive the appropriate treatment. In particular, the nuclear medicine doctor in charge of the procedure 
may provide ways to increase the passing of urine and stools in order to facilitate the removal of 
radioactivity from your body. 
Should you have any further question on the use of Axumin, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. In clinical 
studies side effects were reported by less than 1 in 100 patients given the medicine. 
The following side effects of Axumin are common (may affect up to 1 in 100 people).  
- 
Altered taste in the mouth, altered sense of smell, pain or rash at the site of injection. 
This radiopharmaceutical will deliver low amounts of ionising radiation associated with the least risk 
of cancer and hereditary abnormalities.  
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects talk to your nuclear medicine doctor. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
5.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for bosentan, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
In the previous periodic safety update report (PSUR), 176 new cases of nasal congestion were 
reported, some of them with close time of onset after start of treatment by bosentan. The 
vasodilatation property of bosentan was suggested as a possible role of bosentan in the occurrence of 
the events. It is known that endothelin receptor type A / endothelin receptor type B (ETA and ETB) are 
localised in the nasal mucosa which suggest a potential effect of bosentan on nasal mucosal vessel. 
Nasal congestion is listed in section 4.8 of Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of endothelin 
receptor antagonists (ERA) selective of ETA. When known, a positive dechallenge was reported in 
48/58 cases where the drug was discontinued or interrupted, moreover a positive rechallenge was 
reported in 4 isolated cases. Furthermore, in the final report of the controlled study COMPASS-2 that 
has been completed during this period, it was noted that nasal congestion was reported more 
frequently on bosentan/sildenafil group compared to placebo/sildenafil group (5.0% vs 0% 
respectively). 
The review of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) provided by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH), did 
not show evidence that bosentan might be an initiator of autoimmune processes or events of AIH 
including AIH. Despite this, the potential role of bosentan in unmasking or worsening of AIH in patient 
with autoimmune diseases remains unclear, but it could not be ruled out in some cases in this review. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding nasal congestion and autoimmune hepatitis, the PRAC 
considered that changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosentan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal products containing bosentan is favourable subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

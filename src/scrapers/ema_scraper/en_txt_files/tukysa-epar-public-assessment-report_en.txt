2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Treatment of patients with HER2+ breast cancer after progression on T-DM1 remains a clinical 
challenge, and the prognosis of these patients remains poor. There is no single established standard of 
care (Dieras 2017; Verma 2012) and no approved therapies have demonstrated clinically meaningful 
improvements in PFS or OS (Blackwell 2012; Geyer 2006; Verma 2012). Preferred regimens include 
continuation of HER2 targeted therapy with trastuzumab or lapatinib in combination with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, such as capecitabine (Cardoso 2018; Giordano 2018; Gradishar 2016). However, the 
efficacy of these regimens in this setting remains modest, with reported median PFS of 3.3 to 4.9 
months (Krop 2014; Rugo 2019) and median OS of 15.8 to 17.2 months (Krop 2017; Rugo 2019). 
Hence, there is a significant unmet medical need for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients, who 
have progressed despite receiving current standard of care, including 3 prior anti-HER2 agents, and 
better treatment options for these patients are urgently needed to improve efficacy and tolerability. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for tucatinib is as follows: Tukysa is indicated in combination with trastuzumab 
and capecitabine for the treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-
positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases, who have received at least 2 prior 
anti-HER2 treatment regimens. 
Hence, patients from the targeted patient population have had at least two prior anti-HER2 treatment 
containing regimens for locally advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer in the (neo) adjuvant or 
metastatic setting. Moreover, the inclusion criteria specified that patients should have had received 
previous treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, which is standard of care both in the 
(neo-) adjuvant and the metastatic setting of HER2+ breast cancer. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide (Ferlay 2018), with 
approximately 2 million patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 2018 and more than 600,000 deaths. 
Approximately 1% of breast cancer cases occur in men (Siegel 2019). Historically, HER2+ breast 
cancer tends to be more aggressive and more likely to recur than HER2-negative breast cancer 
(American Cancer Society 2018; Loibl 2017; Slamon 1987). HER2+ breast cancer also 
disproportionately affects younger patients, where the proportion of HER2 positivity is higher compared 
to older patients (Murphy 2019).  
Despite advances, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer remains an 
incurable disease, as patients do not have a standard of care option after disease progression on T-
DM1, and the prognosis of these patients remains poor. Moreover, no systemic agents are specifically 
approved for treatment of the patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer with brain metastases, 
who have an even poorer prognosis.

EMA/78409/2021  
Page 9/148 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Between 15% and 30% of breast cancers overexpress the HER2 receptor and are classified as HER2+ 
breast cancer (Cronin 2010; Loibl 2017; Owens 2004; Slamon 1987; Wolff 2014). HER2 is a member 
of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases that also includes epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR or HER1), HER3, and HER4. HER2 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates 
cell growth, differentiation, and survival. In cancer cells, HER2 protein levels can be increased 10 to 
100-fold above levels found in normal cells (Kraus 1987; Sliwkowski 1999).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Once HER2+ breast cancer has metastasised, the estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rate ranges 
from 15% to 26% (American Cancer Society 2018; National Cancer Institute 2018; National Cancer 
Institute (NCI)). The introduction of HER2-targeted therapy based on inhibition of HER2 using either 
antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab), antibody-drug conjugates (ado trastuzumab emtansine [T-
DM1]), or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; lapatinib and neratinib) has led to significant 
and ongoing improvements in disease-free survival (DFS), progression free survival (PFS), and OS in 
both the adjuvant and metastatic settings (Baselga 2012; Geyer 2006; Slamon 2001; Verma 2012). 
2.1.5.  Management 
First-line treatment for most patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer is a combination of 
trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and chemotherapy. However, within 2 years, the majority of patients 
treated with this combination will progress (Baselga 2012; Swain 2013). After progression on 
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and chemotherapy, standard of care treatment for patients with HER2+ 
metastatic breast cancer is T-DM1. Although T-DM1 is often given as a second line of metastatic 
treatment, when patients receive a pertuzumab-based regimen in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting 
and relapse quickly, T-DM1 may also be given as a first-line metastatic agent (Cardoso 2018; Giordano 
2018). 
Unmet medical need 
Treatment of patients after progression on T-DM1 remains a clinical challenge, and the prognosis of 
these patients remains poor. There is no single established standard of care (Dieras 2017; Verma 
2012) and no approved therapies have demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in PFS or OS 
(Blackwell 2012; Geyer 2006; Verma 2012). Preferred regimens based on American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network (NCCN) guidelines for these patients include continuation of HER2 targeted therapy with 
trastuzumab or lapatinib in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as capecitabine (Cardoso 
2018; Giordano 2018; Gradishar 2016). However, the efficacy of these regimens in this setting 
remains modest, with reported median PFS of 3.3 to 4.9 months (Krop 2014; Rugo 2019) and median 
OS of 15.8 to 17.2 months (Krop 2017; Rugo 2019). There remains significant unmet medical need for 
HER2+ metastatic breast cancer patients who have progressed despite receiving current standard of 
care, including 3 prior anti-HER2 agents, and better treatment options for these patients are urgently 
needed to improve efficacy and tolerability.

macrogol 4000 (E1521), talc (E553b), yellow iron oxide (E172). 
The film-coated tablets are available in oriented polyamide (OPA)/aluminium foil/polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) laminate blisters sealed with aluminium foil. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tucatinib is N6-(4,5-dihydro-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolyl)-N4-[3-methyl-4-
([1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-7-yloxy)phenyl]-4,6-quinazolinediamine. Tucatinib is ethanol 
compounded (2:1). It corresponds to the molecular formula C26H24N8O2 – ½ C2H5OH. Its relative 
molecular mass is 503.57 and it has the chemical structure shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Chemical structure of tucatinib hemiethanolate 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of  liquid 
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), 1H-, 13C-, 15N- NMR spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, XRD 
(single crystal and powder crystallography, respectively), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, to 
evaluate molar ratio of solvent) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, to further characterise 
ethanol solvate). 
Tucatinib appears as an off-white to yellow, non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is practically 
insoluble in water; in aqueous buffer solutions at pH above 4 it has low solubility (<0.4 mg/ml); below 
pH 4 the active substance exhibits high solubility (>18.9 mg/ml). The active substance is a weak base 
with pKas of 2.07, 4.18, and 6.15; its partition coefficient was found to be 5.3. 
Tucatinib molecule does not exhibits stereoisomerism.  
Polymorphism has been observed for tucatinib. It has been found to exist in many solid-state forms: 4 
crystalline anhydrous polymorphs and 25 crystalline pseudopolymorphs have been characterised to

EMA/78409/2021  
Page 11/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
date. Of the 25 pseudopolymorphs, 3 hydrates, 6 classical-type solvates, 1 transient solvate and 3 
unique isostructural solvates composing 15 solvates have been identified. Crystalline solvate form 
(form B) tucatinib hemiethanolate was selected for further development due favourable physico-
chemical properties. Tucatinib hemiethanolate (form B) is obtained consistently by the manufacturing 
process. It has been demonstrated that there is no change in polymorphic form of the active substance 
during AS storage.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The AS manufacturing sites were stated. 
The synthesis of tucatinib hemiethanolate consists in total of six steps.  
To the starting materials initially proposed by the applicant, another one was designated upon the 
request of the CHMP. All SMs have been justified in line with the considerations of ICH Q11 and are 
acceptable. The SMs are controlled by acceptable specifications. Isolated intermediates in the synthesis 
are clearly defined and are sufficiently characterised and controlled by appropriate specifications. 
Yields of each step and the batch size of active substance have been stated. All solvents, auxiliary 
materials, catalysts and reagents are sufficiently specified and adequately controlled. 
Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and normal operating ranges (NORs) for material inputs and 
process/operating parameters were established based on multivariate design of experiments (DOE) 
and one variable at a time (OVAT) approaches. The resulting PARs, NORs, and target values are listed 
in all steps of the synthesis. It was confirmed that a design space is not applied for and in line with the 
PARs definition, only one parameter will be changed at a time keeping the other parameters within 
their NOR. For each step, a tabulated overview of process parameters covering material inputs and 
reaction conditions/operating parameters with corresponding PAR and NOR has been presented and 
criticality of each process parameter was assessed. The synthesis does not have any critical steps. 
However critical process parameters (CPPs) and non CPP have been identified and were clearly 
indicated.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
The possible impurities from the manufacturing process have been listed and their mutagenic class has 
been reported. For each step, sufficient details of the fate and purge of impurities in the isolation and 
purification of the process intermediates and the final active substance have been presented and were 
updated during the procedure upon the definition of an additional starting material. The potential 
carry-over of the residual solvents and inorganic impurities used in the manufacturing process used in 
the manufacturing process has been also adequately discussed. Overall the presented information for 
all potential impurities, their fate and control, is satisfactory and the control strategy in this regard is 
considered acceptable. 
The process development has been sufficiently described. The same main synthetic route has been 
used during development. Minor changes during transfer of the process between sites, during scale up 
and to ensure facility fit have been described sufficiently. 
Transferring to the commercial site included minor modifications in step 3, clearer description of step 4 
and adjustment of IPCs in same step. An overview of the synthetic processes, sites and use of active 
substance batches in the finished product studies has been provided. The impact of all modification 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 12/148 
 
 
 
 
 
throughout the process development has been assessed and concluded either that the product quality 
is not affected or improved. 
The AS is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, which are placed in a high-density 
polyethylene HDPE drum. A satisfactory specification for the LDPE bag is provided. The LDPE complies 
with the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011, Regulation (EC) No. 1935/2004, and with Ph. 
Eur. 3.1.3 “Polyolefins”.  
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis 
and container closure 
The AS specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, 
FT-IR), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, two methods), residual solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. 
Eur.), palladium (ICP-MS), polymorphic form (XRPD), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial 
enumeration tests (Ph. Eur.). 
The limit for any unspecified impurity corresponds to the ICH Q3A identification threshold. The limits 
proposed for certain specified impurities exceed the ICH Q3A qualification threshold but have been 
toxicologically qualified and, in addition, were demonstrated as presenting no structural alert for 
genotoxicity. 
The specifications limits for residual solvents have been set according to ICH Q3C, except for ethanol. 
The limit for ethanol content exceeds ICH Q3C option 1. The ethanol contribution from the 
hemiethanolate in the AS was theoretically calculated. Ethanol is used in the final step of the 
manufacturing process to transform tucatinib into the hemiethanolate polymorphic form. As ethanol is 
a key component of the AS structure, a limit other than the ICH Q3C residual solvent limit is 
warranted. Using ICH Q3C option 2 (maximum daily dose = 600 mg, PDE 50 mg/day) the concentration 
limit was calculated. The AS is dissolved during finished product manufacture and it has been 
demonstrated that ethanol is removed in downstream finished product manufacture. AS batches 
containing ethanol within the proposed specification limits, result in finished product intermediate 
(spray-dried dispersion) with ethanol content in a range; which is considered not to impact patient 
safety and thus the proposed ethanol specification limit in the AS is acceptable. 
Risk assessment of elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D has been conducted. Levels of all 
Class 1 and Class 2A elements are <30% of the PDE, hence no additional controls are deemed 
necessary. Intentionally added catalyst palladium, was also found below <30% of the PDE but it is 
controlled in the AS specification.   
Batch data were provided for five commercial scale AS batches manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site using the synthetic route proposed for commercial manufacture. Batch data for 
another ten commercial and pilot scale development batches manufactured at the development 
manufacturing sites were also provided. All the results comply with the proposed AS specification and 
demonstrate consistent manufacture and quality of the AS. 
Stability 
Stability data has been provided for five commercial scale batches manufactured at the proposed 
manufacturing site. These stability batches were packaged in the proposed container closure system. 
Stability data were provided for up to 24 months stored at long term conditions (25°C / 60% RH and 
30°C / 65% RH) and for up to nine months at accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines.

Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities (specified impurities any unspecified impurity, 
total impurities), ethanol, water content and polymorphic form. Assay values fluctuated and a tendency 
to increase in total impurities were observed but both parameters remained within the limits as did all 
other tested parameters.  
Photostability testing was carried out on one commercial scale batch in as per ICH Q1B. No 
degradation was found in the light-exposed and the controlled samples after the exposure, indicating 
that AS is not light sensitive. 
Stress testing of the AS was performed to evaluate degradation of the AS and the stability indicating 
capability of the AS HPLC assay and purity method. These studies were conducted using a commercial 
scale batch placed under a variety of stressed conditions including acidic, basic, oxidative, aqueous, 
and thermal stress. It was also concluded that the HPLC assay and purity method is stability indicating. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed retest period at the recommended storage 
temperature is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet presented in two strengths, containing 
50 mg and 150 mg of tucatinib respectively. The 50 mg strength tablet is a round, yellow tablet, 
debossed “TUC” on one side and “50” on the other. The 150 mg strength tablet is an oval-shaped 
yellow tablet, debossed “TUC” on one side and “150” on the other.  
The qualitative composition of Tukysa is presented in section 2.2.1 of this report and in SmPC section 
6.1. All excipients used are standard and are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The two 
strengths are dose proportional apart from a small difference in the amount of film-coating. The film-
coating is non-functional.  
The development of the formulation and manufacturing process was conducted following a traditional 
pharmaceutical development approach that targeted an immediate release oral product. However, 
principles of enhanced approach as described in ICH Q8 through Q11 such as definition critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) as well as formulation and process risk assessments have been utilised in 
formulation and process development, but no design spaces have been claimed. 
Tucatinib is a BCS Class 2 compound exhibiting low aqueous solubility and high permeability. Early 
clinical studies used two different powder in capsule formulations and two different micronised powder 
in suspension formulations.  
The development and selection of the formulation was driven by the early formulations used initially in 
the clinical development. Different formulations containing tucatinib hemiethanolate were used and 
compared in clinical studies: powder in capsule, micronised powder in capsule, suspension of 
micronised active substance, solution of active substance and amorphous tablet formulation, 
respectively. The observed high inter-subject pharmacokinetic variability and an effect on absorption of 
tucatinib when administered in the fed state, triggered further development work evaluating enabling 
formulations of tucatinib. No AS concentrations used in manufacturing process are above the 
equilibrium solubility limits.  
The development of the formulation was described in detail. A discussion of the different solvent 
systems evaluated, and lots produced from each solvent system were provided. The final solvent 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 14/148 
 
 
 
system was selected to minimise residual water and reduce the risk for potential hydrolysis of 
tucatinib. This solvent system was used throughout clinical development at the commercial 
manufacturing site and remains unchanged for the proposed commercial process. During manufacture 
of the intermediate, the AS is converted from tucatinib hemiethanolate (crystalline polymorphic form 
B) to tucatinib (amorphous form).  
In order to ensure the immediate release of drug, the tablet formulation include crospovidone as a 
disintegrant and multiple disintegrant aids to achieve rapid disintegration to particles or small granules, 
thereby facilitating rapid dissolution. A dry granulation is employed to improve the flowability, particle 
size uniformity, and compressibility of the powder blend. The amount of intermediate is adjusted based 
on its potency with concomitant equivalent adjustments to the weights of sodium chloride, potassium 
chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. 
Two complementary dissolution methods, method 1 and method 2, are used to control the finished 
product. Dissolution method 1 was included in the initial dossier, while dissolution method 2 was 
introduced during the procedure following a major objection raised by CHMP concerning the 
discriminatory power of method 1. The development of both dissolution methods has been sufficiently 
described and justified. The proposal for the combination of two dissolution methods and their 
corresponding limits for the control of the finished product has been adequately supported by 
development data; the approach is acceptable. 
Dissolution method 1 has not been demonstrated to be discriminatory with regards to the most critical 
attributes in the finished product, which are the form of the active substance and the particle size of  
the intermediate. Since the data presented clearly demonstrates that the dissolution method cannot 
differentiate between the proposed formulation containing the AS in the amorphous form and a 
formulation containing 100% crystalline AS, the use of the method to waive any bioequivalence testing 
in the future is not an option. Based on the dissolution profiles/data presented, the proposed 
acceptance criteria for dissolution of (method 1) has been justified.  
Dissolution method 2 has been demonstrated to be discriminatory with regards to different 
concentrations of crystalline content, minor composition quantitative changes and hardness of the film-
coated tablets. Based on the development data and the test of the pivotal batches and the primary 
stability batches, the proposed acceptance criterion for dissolution (method 2) has been justified. 
However, since this acceptance criterion was based on limited batch data and stability data, the CHMP 
requested, and the applicant has made, the following commitments: 1) to re-evaluate the specification 
limit for dissolution (method 2) when data from 30 finished product batches and at least 12 months of 
stability data are available is available post-approval and 2) to submit updated batch analysis data and 
stability data for the finished product analysed with the complementary dissolution method 2 when 
data is available post-approval; this approach is accepted (See 3.1.6).  
The formulation and manufacturing process of the finished product have remained the same 
throughout clinical development and remain unchanged for the proposed commercial process. The sites 
involved in the development and the history of finished product batches produced throughout clinical 
development including manufacture of the primary stability batches was presented. 
A process risk assessment to assess the potential impact of manufacturing process unit operations 
critical quality attributes (CQAs) has been performed. The process steps feed solution preparation, 
spray drying and secondary drying and their potential impact on each CQA (assay, related substances, 
crystallinity, residual solvents, water content and PSD) have been investigated. The proposed PARs 
have been justified.  
For the film-coated tablets, an initial risk assessment was performed to assess the potential impact of 
manufacturing process unit operations on tucatinib CQAs and a summary was presented. The chosen 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 15/148 
 
 
 
CQAs are justified and are all included and controlled in the product specification as discussed later in 
the report. The unit operations pre-blending, roller compaction, final blending, tablet compression, and 
film- coating were considered to have a medium overall risk to influence tablet CQAs, and therefore 
evaluation of the process parameters of these unit operations were evaluated in DOE studies. Based on 
these investigations PARs for process parameters of each unit operation have been established. The 
development of the control strategy for tucatinib film-coated tablets has been described in sufficient 
detail. 
Tukysa film-coated tablets are packaged in oPA/ALU/PVC blister sealed with aluminium foil. The 
suitability of the container closure system was evaluated with respect to safety and compatibility, and 
with respect to protection from moisture ingress (water vapor transmission rate) and oxygen 
transmission rates. The proposed container closure system is suitable in order to minimise moisture 
uptake and the increase in the carbamate (hydrolysis) impurity in the finished product. Satisfactory 
specifications for the blister were provided. The material complies with Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 on 
Food Contact Materials, Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 as amended, Ph. Eur. 3.1.11 and 3.2.2. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in two sites. 
The manufacturing process is divided into the manufacture of the intermediate and the manufacture of 
the film-coated tablets. The manufacturing process for the intermediate comprises four steps. A 
flowchart including the applied IPCs was presented. The manufacturing process was described in 
sufficient detail including conditions/parameters and equipment used. The IPCs have been described 
including methods and acceptance criteria. The PARs have been set according to the results obtained 
during pharmaceutical development. No critical process parameters were identified. The release and 
stability specifications for the intermediate cover relevant parameters for this finished product 
intermediate and are suitable to control its quality. Sufficient batch analysis data were provided for the 
intermediate. 
The intermediate is packaged in a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) sleeve, cable tied, and placed 
inside a second LDPE bag with a desiccant bag in between to reduce moisture ingress. The outer bag is 
then cable tied, placed into an aluminium foil plastic laminated bag, vacuumed down and heat-sealed; 
it is then placed into a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drum. The primary container closure system 
is selected in accordance with the Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials 
(CPMP/QWP/4359/03). The LDPE bags in contact with the product comply with Commission Regulation 
(EU) No. 10/2011 as amended. 
The manufacturing process from the intermediate to tucatinib film-coated tablets comprises six steps. 
A flowchart including the applied IPCs was presented. 
A detailed description of the manufacturing process was provided which includes information on 
equipment and materials used. Based on manufacturing development no critical steps identified. 
Relevant operating parameters with PARs were tabulated. PAR ranges originating from process 
development studies have been updated, taking into account process validation results, where 
appropriate. NORs were introduced as requested which are considered sufficiently narrow. It has been 
clarified that no design space is claimed. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical dosage form. 
The packaging material for bulk tucatinib film-coated tablets which is defined as product intermediate 
was stated. The material complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 10/2011 as amended, and Ph. 
Eur. 3.1.4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021

Holding times have been defined and supported by acceptable stability data discussed later in the 
report. The shelf-life period is calculated from the mixing of the intermediate with remaining excipients 
in the film-coated tablet; this has been justified as per the Note for guidance on the start of shelf-life 
of the finished dosage form (EMEA/CVMP/453/01), the Guideline on manufacture of the finished 
dosage form (EMA/CHMP/QWP/245074/2015) and by appropriately designed and conducted stability 
studies on the intermediate and the respective finished product as discussed below in Stability. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The manufacturing process and dosage form are considered 
standard, hence validation data for commercial scale has not been presented; this is in line with 
Guideline on process validation for finished products. In line with the same guideline, detailed process 
validation schemes for the manufacturing process of the intermediate and the film-coated tablets have 
been presented. Confirmations have been provided that process validation using the first three 
production scale batches of the intermediate and the film-coated tablets will be completed prior to 
commercialisation.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
appearance (visual), identification (FT-IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), 
degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, method 1 and 2 (Ph. Eur., HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.) 
and microbial limit tests (Ph. Eur.).  
Overall, the specification has been adequately set in accordance with ICH Q6A, Ph. Eur. and based on 
available comprehensive batch analysis and stability data. The limits for degradation products 
correspond to ICH Q3B identification threshold, hence they are acceptable. The proposal for the 
combination of two dissolution methods and their corresponding limits for the control of the finished 
product has been adequately supported by development data; the approach is acceptable. In relation 
to this, the CHMP requested, and the applicant has made, two commitments to be addressed post 
approval, as discussed above. The omission of testing of crystallinity was sufficiently justified since the 
dissolution method was found capable of differentiating tablets batches spiked with crystalline AS. 
A risk assessment for the potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished has been conducted 
in accordance with ICH Q3D, applying the drug component approach. The relevant discussion has been 
provided. No elemental impurities were identified to be present at a level of greater than 30% of the 
PDE limit for oral administration. Based on this, tests for elemental impurities are not included in the 
finished product specification.  
A risk assessment, in line with the guidance documents published on the EMA website, with respect to 
potential formation of nitrosamine impurities has been presented considering all potential sources 
along the manufacturing process, including active substance, excipients, water, finished product 
intermediate manufacture, finished product manufacture, equipment and packaging. The outcome of 
the risk assessment confirms that there is no risk for nitrosamine impurities formation. The risk 
assessment is found acceptable and no further confirmatory testing is warranted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with ICH Q2 
guideline. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were presented for five batches of the 50 mg tablet strength and nine batches of 
the 150 mg strength; all batches were of commercial scale. Of these batches, three batches per each 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 17/148 
 
 
 
strength were manufactured by the proposed manufacturer while the rest are from development sites. 
All results complied with the specifications in place at the time. The results showed that the finished 
product meets the proposed specifications and confirm consistency in manufacture.  
Stability of the product 
Intermediate 
The stability of the intermediate has been established based on data from appropriately designed and 
conducted stability studies. All stability batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site 
and were packaged in the proposed container closure system. Samples were tested as per the 
specification of the intermediate and all results were within the specification. Based on this data the 
intermediate holding time and storage temperature is acceptable. 
Film-coated tablets 
Stability data from three commercial scale primary stability batches of each strength, stored for up to 
12 months under long term conditions (25±2°C / 60±5% RH and 30±2°C / 65±5% RH), for up to 12 
months at 5°C/ambient and for up to nine months under accelerated conditions (40±2 ºC / 75±5% 
RH), according to the ICH guidelines, were provided. These primary stability batches were 
manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site and were packaged in the proposed container 
closure system. 
Stability samples were tested according to the shelf-life specification tests. Regardless of the storage 
conditions, results comply with the shelf-life specification limits. Assay was well-within limits; 
impurities remained low, but with tendency to increase at accelerated conditions for specified impurity 
(hydrolysis) and total impurities, water content fluctuating but had a tendency to increase. All 
parameters remained also within the specifications.  
Of the primary stability batches, one batch per strength was manufactured using aged intermediate as 
per the proposed intermediate holding time. There was no difference in the results for the finished 
product batch containing aged intermediate, compared to other batches. As mentioned above, the 
finished product shelf life in the SmPC is calculated from the mixing of the intermediate with remaining 
excipients in the film-coated tablet. 
Supportive stability data from the same six primary stability product batches but packaged in HDPE 
bottles and stored for nine months under the same accelerated conditions were also presented as 
supportive data since they represent worst case scenario because the level of protection against 
humidity is lower than that of the blister package. Based on the comparison of the most prominent 
degradation product in bottles versus blisters at 40°C/75% RH, tablets in blister packaging have the 
same or better stability profile than tablets stored in bottles. Therefore, the data from batches stored 
in bottles support the proposed shelf life for product stored in the proposed blister packaging. 
One commercial scale batch of each tablet strength has been subjected to photostability testing in 
accordance with ICH Q1B. The results indicate that the finished product is not sensitive to light. 
Forced degradation studies were conducted on tablets from a development batch which were subjected 
to stress conditions including thermolytic, photolytic, oxidative, and hydrolytic (humidity, acidic, basic) 
conditions. The stability-indicating nature of the methods has been demonstrated. 
Based on the submitted stability data the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without any special storage 
condition, as stated in SmPC 6.3, is acceptable.

Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacture of Tukysa film-coated tablets are of animal or human 
origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The MOs raised during the procedure concerning the starting 
materials in the active substance synthesis and the suitability of the dissolution method and the 
corresponding acceptance criteria in the finished product specification have been satisfactorily 
addressed and the dossier was updated accordingly. The overall control strategy is adequately justified 
and is acceptable. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were two of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to a request to submit additional batch analysis 
and stability data for the finished product analysed with the complementary dissolution method 2 and 
the re-evaluation of the specification limit for dissolution method 2. These points are put forward and 
agreed as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and 
biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated 
and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to submit updated batch data and stability data for the finished product analysed with the 
complementary dissolution method 2, when available, via an appropriate post authorisation 
procedure.   
- to re-evaluate the finished product specification limit for dissolution (method 2) once 30 finished 
product batches have been tested for release and at least 12 months of stability data are available 
on finished product validation batches, to provide assurance that the appropriate specification is 
implemented. When available, the updated batch data and stability data and re-evaluation of 
specification should be submitted via an appropriate post authorisation procedure. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical efficacy and safety of tucatinib were characterised through a battery of pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies. The potency and selectivity of tucatinib were evaluated in 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 19/148 
 
 
 
vitro using biochemical and cellular signalling assays. The anti-tumour activity of tucatinib was 
evaluated in vitro and in vivo in mouse tumour xenograft models.  
The safety pharmacology of tucatinib was evaluated in Good Laboratory Practices (GLP)-compliant 
studies to examine effects on functions including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurobehavioral and 
respiratory. 
The pharmacokinetics of tucatinib after a single oral or intravenous (IV) dose in mice, rats, and 
cynomolgus monkeys were investigated. The toxicokinetics (TKs) of tucatinib were evaluated in repeat-
dose toxicology studies in rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys. 
The toxicology of tucatinib was evaluated in a series of GLP-compliant studies including: repeat-dose 
general toxicology studies in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, phototoxicity studies in vitro and in rats, 
genotoxicity studies including the standard test battery, embryo-fetal toxicity studies in pregnant rats 
and rabbits. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Effect of tucatinib on HER2 kinase activity in enzymatic assays (study report TRN-5457) 
To determine the potency and selectivity of tucatinib for purified ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB1 (EGFR) and 
ErbB4 (HER4), biochemical experiments were conducted using purified enzymes. HER3 was not 
evaluated because it was reported to have minimal kinase activity (Citri et al., 2003). Several 
approaches were used: for HER2, the kinase assay was performed using the protein kinase domain 
(amino acids 691-1255) while for EGFR a purified full-length enzyme preparation was used. In both 
cases, the assays were conducted using 15 μM adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and poly-Glu:Tyr (PGT, 
4:1) as a substrate. For HER4, a His6-tagged protein kinase domain was employed (amino acids 706-
991) and assays were performed using 7.5 μM ATP with PGT as a substrate. Phosphorylated tyrosine 
content was determined by ELISA using the phosphotyrosine specific monoclonal antibody (PY20). 
The results of these experiments indicated tucatinib was a potent inhibitor of HER2 and was selective 
for HER2 compared with the ErbB kinase family members EGFR and HER4. Based on Ki calculations, 
tucatinib demonstrated a 28- to 88-fold increase in potency for HER2 relative to EGFR, and a 92–105-
fold increase in potency for HER2 relative to HER4.  
Experiments were also conducted to determine the time dependence of tucatinib mediated inhibition of 
HER2 by monitoring the production of phosphorylated product over time using various concentrations 
of tucatinib (study report TRN-5457). The results of this analysis were consistent with tucatinib having 
a slow on rate, and given the low nM potency of HER2 inhibition, the results were also consistent with 
tucatinib having a very slow off rate. These data were consistent with findings published for the 
structurally related HER2/EGFR kinase inhibitor lapatinib which was also shown to have a very slow off 
rate from the kinase domain of HER2 (Wood et al., 2004). 
Effect of tucatinib on HER2 kinase activity in BT-474 cells (study report TRN-5480) 
The BT-474 cell line was chosen to test the capacity of tucatinib in blocking HER2 phosphorylation as it 
contains a genomic duplication of the HER2 gene, resulting in high level expression of HER2 protein on 
the cell surface. The mean IC50 value from the aggregate of 16 experiments yielded an IC50 value of 
9.88 nM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 20/148 
 
 
 
Effect of tucatinib on EGFR kinase activity in A431 cells (study report TRN-5477) 
The cell line A431, an epidermoid carcinoma derived cell line that overexpresses EGFR was employed to 
determine the capacity of tucatinib in blocking EGFR phosphorylation. Although this cell line expresses 
high protein levels of EGFR, the expression of HER2 is low. The mean IC50 value from the aggregate of 
13 experiments yielded an IC50 value estimated to be 13,800 nM. 
Effect of tucatinib on signal transduction downstream of HER2 kinase (study report TRN-
5517) 
The assessment was conducted in the HER2+ cell line BT-474. The assays included phosphorylation of 
HER2,  HER3,  AKT,  ERK1/2  and  MEK1  kinases,  being  all  key  signal  transduction  intermediates 
downstream  of  HER2.  HER2  and  HER3  phosphorylation  status  was  determined  by  measuring  total 
phosphotyrosine levels. For AKT the measurements were focused on the phosphorylation of serine 473 
(signaling  through  PI3  kinase  pathway);  ERK1/2  were  investigated  by  the  phosphorylation  status  of 
several members of the kinase pathway  
The effect of tucatinib on each of these signaling pathways in BT-474 cells showed that HER2, HER3, 
ERK1/2, and MEK1 phosphorylation were each inhibited by tucatinib (Table 1 and Figure 2). These data 
indicate  the  selective  inhibition  of  HER2  by  tucatinib  can  inhibit  signaling  initiated  by  either  HER2 
homodimers (ERK1/2, MEK1) as well as HER2/HER3 heterodimers (AKT).

obtained in this setting for the combination of trastuzumab and tucatinib, showed enhanced signal 
transduction inhibition and increased apoptosis of tumoral cells.  
Further assessment of the enhanced effect of the combination of trastuzumab and tucatinib was 
explored in in vivo models and will be discussed below.  
The applicant studied the relationship between the potency of tucatinib and HER2 protein levels. 
Several breast carcinoma-derived cell lines, expressing variable levels of HER2 (which were staged in 
negative, low and high) were employed, and the results showed increased potency of tucatinib on 
those cell lines presenting higher levels of HER2.

The results of these experiments demonstrated tucatinib can elicit potent antitumour activity (EC50 
values <500 nM) only in breast cancer cell lines expressing ≥300,000 HER2 receptors/cell. The most 
potent EC50 values for tucatinib (<100 nM) were observed when receptor density on the cell surface 
approached or surpassed 106 (7x105 to 1.5x106). 
Cell proliferation assays were performed using the HER2+ cell line BT-474 and the EGFR amplified cell 
line A431 to assess how the relative potencies of tucatinib against HER2 or EGFR phosphorylation 
correlate with effects on cell growth and division . Correlating cytotoxicity in the BT-474 cells was 
observed (IC50: 15.45 nM). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that tucatinib did not induce 
cytotoxicity as potently in A431 cells and is thus not an antagonist of EGFR.

In vivo studies 
Mouse tumour xenograft models 
Either allografted or xenografted tumours, based on HER2 overexpressing cells, were used to study the 
capacity of tucatinib to inhibit tumour growth in vivo (STUDY TRN 5453; TRN 5458; TRN 5454). While 
in the allografted HER2-driven tumours both tumour control, measured as tumour growth inhibition, 
and inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation were observed, no tumour regression was evident at the end of 
the study.  
In xenografted HER2 driven tumours, partial regression was seen in several animals exposed to the 
highest doses of tucatinib. This effect may be related to the cytotoxic capacity of tucatinib in BT-474 
cells used in this model. In the xenograft models, superior antitumor effects were achieved when 
tucatinib was combined with trastuzumab or docetaxel, setting up the rationale for the combination of 
these molecules (Study TRN 5452; TRN 5550-3). This is consistent with published data and current 
clinical practice, showing complementary effects on HER2-driven tumours.  
A  separate  study  was  conducted  with  the  purpose  of  demonstrating  the  effect  of  tucatinib  on  HER2 
positive brain metastasis (Study TRN 5455). The results showed increased survival of the animals and 
reduced phosphorylation status of HER2. However, these results deserve additional consideration in light 
of the observations from the tucatinib distribution assays, which showed limited distribution of tucatinib 
to brain tissues. Changes on the permeability of tucatinib might be dependent upon different properties 
of the blood-brain barrier in the tumoral setting. See pharmacokinetics section for further discussion. 
Regarding the pharmacodynamic activity of the metabolite ONT-993, it has been studied following the 
same principles applied to the parent molecule. The first in vitro enzymatic assay was conducted in the 
absence of tucatinib; in further studies in cells ONT-993 was compared to tucatinib. ONT-993 resulted 
to be similar to tucatinib in terms of selectivity for HER2, however showed slightly lower potency for 
HER2 phosphorylation inhibition and cytotoxicity (Study TRN 5457; TRN 5444). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
With the purpose of addressing the potential effects of tucatinib and its predominant metabolite 
(racemic ONT-993) over other kinases, the applicant has conducted two broad kinome assays, 
studying over 250 kinases on each assay.

The conditions were adjusted to each particular kinase and much higher concentrations of tucatinib and 
ONT-993 were employed to assure that any potential effect over a substrate would be seen.  
The results showed the preference of both products for ErbB family members including EGFR, ErbB4, 
and 4 mutant versions of EGFR over other different kinases.  
The potential of tucatinib and ONT-993 to interact with other targets besides kinases, including 
receptors, ion channels, neurotransmitters and peptides has not been investigated. Bibliographical data 
together with available non-clinical studies and clinical safety data did not indicate any relevant 
mammalian toxicities related to receptor binding which suggests the absence of off-target effects upon 
tucatinib administration. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
A battery of GLP studies was conducted to assess the safety pharmacology of tucatinib. The effects 
over cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system, as well as the effects on the 
gastrointestinal system were assessed.

Tucatinib inhibited the hERG channel 0.3% at 0.3 µM, 2.9% at 1 µM, 8.6% at 3 
µM, and 42% at 10 µM, respectively, and was not soluble at 30 µM. The

No effects at 10 or 30 mg/kg. 100 mg/kg: trend for increased secretion volume 
and significant increase in secretion acidity 4 hr postdose. NOEL=30 mg/kg. 
No effect on gut motility at doses up to 100 mg/kg  
NOEL=100 mg/kg 
No significant effects. NOEL=100 mg/kg. 
No significant effects. NOAEL=100 mg/kg. 
Gastric irritation was significantly higher at 100 mg/kg than in the vehicle 
control group. 
No significant effects noted in MABP, HR, or ECG waveforms or in QT and 
QTc measurements. No effects on body temperature, body weight and food 
consumption were observed. The only clinical sign was swollen abdomens after 
the second dose of 30 mg/kg that resolved within 24 hr. NOEL=45 mg/kg BID.  
The results indicated substantial gastric irritation and minor changes in gastric secretion upon single, 
high doses of tucatinib.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential concomitant toxicity of tucatinib and trastuzumab was not assessed in non-clinical in vivo 
models. Concomitant toxicity was studied in the pivotal clinical study HER2CLIMB, and no an increased 
incidence of adverse cardiac events in the combination treatment arm has been observed (see Clinical 
safety). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (ADME) of tucatinib was evaluated in nonclinical species used for pharmacology 
and safety testing of tucatinib (mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey).  
The method developed to measure tucatinib in K2EDTA rat, monkey and rabbit plasma in support of 
the GLP pivotal toxicological studies has been validated across the concentrations ranging from 1.00-
1000 ng/ml. The relative standard deviation (RSD)% of within-run and between-run values is in line 
with relevant guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). The dilution integrity and 
long-term stability as well as stability during freeze thaw cycles were assessed and showed that 
tucatinib is stable for up to 4 freeze-thaw cycles at -70 C in all matrixes and that tucatinib is stable for 
403, 426 and 29 days at -70 C in rat, monkey and rabbit plasma, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetics (PKs) of single oral dosing with tucatinib was investigated in CD-1 mice, adult 
Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys.

Results in the repeat dose PK studies and TK studies as part of the repeat dose toxicity GLP studies 
generally supported the findings in the single dose studies in mice and rats. Large variations in 
exposure were observed in monkeys in PK and TK investigations. After single dose administration up to 
45 mg/kg a less than dose proportional exposure was observed. In repeat dose administration up to 60 
mg/kg/dose for 5 days, mean AUCinf and Cmax values increased in a greater than proportional 
manner at the 30 to 60 mg/kg doses. In the TK investigations in the repeat-dose toxicological studies,

exposure was linear and dose proportional. Accumulation occurred in the repeat dose PK study in 
monkeys, however, accumulation was not observed in the TK investigations.  
Mean bioavailability (F) ranged from 187-302% in monkeys and 34-284 % in rats (however, 21.9-
23.8% in rats at 10 mg/kg PO vs. 0.5 mg/kg IV). F was not established in mice. Total body clearance 
(CL) and volume of distribution (Vss) was consistent in mice and rats, and compared to F, decreased 
with the increase of the dose. No trend was observed in monkeys.  
A similar metabolite rate (MR) was observed in the tested species of 2-5% ONT-993 after single dose 
and repeat dose. However, in mice, the MR increased to 9.47% in plasma after repeat dosing, whereas 
the MR in the brain was measured to 21%, which indicated that a larger amount of metabolite was 
found in brain compared to plasma. 
The accumulation of both tucatinib (1.6- to 5-fold) and ONT-993 (3-fold) occurred in all species in the 
PK investigations, however, no or minimal accumulation occurred in monkeys in the GLP toxicological 
study. There were no significant gender differences in terms of either Cmax or AUC0-24 in the pivotal 
studies. Adequate exposure was achieved in plasma via the proposed clinical route with safety margins 
ranging between 0.03 and 1.0 relative to exposure at the intended clinical dose of 300 mg BID per 
day. 
Distribution studies were conducted using oral administration. Protein binding of tucatinib was similar 
across nonclinical species and humans and was not associated with drug concentration. Blood-to-
plasma ratios for tucatinib in humans suggests that tucatinib resides in the blood and plasma 
compartments in a similar portion. Tucatinib appears to be a substrate for P-gp transport at low 
concentrations (<10 µM) and was found to have a high permeability as an active efflux substrate in 
Caco-2 cells. 
In mice, accumulation occurred in the brain with higher concentrations of tucatinib and ONT-993 in the 
brain tissue than in plasma. Further, tucatinib was shown to preferentially distribute to tumour tissue 
in the brain of mice. In rats, however, no levels of tucatinib were detected in the brain other than in 
meninges until 336 h post-dose. The distribution was seen to the excretory organs with the highest 
levels in liver compared to kidney measurable until 168 h post-dose. There was a clear decrease in 
radioactivity in all tissues over time with no retention in blood or plasma. After 672 h female and male 
rats still retained high concentrations of radioactivity in the uveal tract and eyes (33,200 and 7,060 ng 
eq/ml in females and 28,100 and 3950 ng eq/ml in males, respectively), though the level had 
decreased significantly (approximately 2-fold) from the highest level. Accumulation in pigmented skin 
was also observed, however, concentrations were BLQ at 336 h post-dose. It appears that tucatinib 
has an affinity for pigmented tissue. No toxicological concern was identified regarding accumulation in 
eye, as repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and rats did not reveal any ophthalmic findings, nor 
was tucatinib considered of phototoxic potential in an in vivo phototoxic investigation. 
No data was submitted on placental transfer. 
Tucatinib is extensively metabolised mainly via oxidative metabolism, where ONT-993 is the main 
metabolite observed in all species. M4, M5 and M13 is furthermore observed in all species. ONT-993 is 
a chiral compound, and it was shown that the R-isomer is preferentially formed compared to the S-
isomer in both human and cynomolgus monkey, in vitro and in vivo, with observed ratios from 3.2 to 
4.85. The in vitro metabolism profile of [14C]-tucatinib was investigated in liver microsomes and 
hepatocytes from mouse, rat, rabbit, cynomolgus monkey, and human. All metabolites identified in 
humans in vitro were also observed in the nonclinical species tested. It was shown in vitro that 
tucatinib is metabolised by multiple CYP enzymes, primarily by CYP2C8, the responsible CYP isoform to 
form ONT-993, followed by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, responsible for forming M5 and M9-10. Aldehyde 
oxidase was also identified as an enzyme involved in the metabolism of tucatinib, potentially to M20.

EMA/78409/2021

Unchanged tucatinib was the predominant radioactive component in circulation and excretion, followed 
by oxidative metabolites ONT-993 and M5 as well as hydrolysis metabolite M2 and N-dealkylation 
metabolite M3 in rats. In rats (30 mg/kg dose oral), the majority of radioactivity was found in faeces 
(90.9%) with 0.5% recovered in urine. In bile-duct cannulated male rats, bile accounted for 12.3% of 
the dose while 80.2% was found in the faeces with only 1% recovered in urine. Based on urinary and 
bile excretion, the absorbed dose was approximately 13.4% in this study. Enterohepatic circulation of 
tucatinib is observed in rats with minimal effects on PK.  
In monkeys, the majority of the orally administered [14C]tucatinib derived radioactivity was excreted 
as metabolites and, to a lesser extent as unmetabolised tucatinib via faeces. In cynomolgus monkeys, 
excretion primarily occurred via faeces accounting for 76.6% of the administered dose while excretion 
via urine accounted for 1.78%. Urinary excretion appeared to be a minor route of elimination for 
tucatinib and [14C]tucatinib derived radioactivity. In faeces, the sum of identified oxidative/conjugated 
metabolites were approximately 50%, suggesting that at least 50% of dosed [14C]tucatinib was 
absorbed.  
In humans, tucatinib appeared to undergo extensive metabolism after an oral dose, and with the 
largest amount of radioactivity identified as tucatinib followed by its metabolites, found predominantly 
in faeces with lesser amounts found in urine. All metabolites detected in the human plasma samples 
were observed at exposures less than the 10%. ONT-993 was the most abundant metabolite in human 
steady state plasma and it accounted for 6.46%. It appears that two human in vivo metabolites (M18 
and M28, accounting for 6.07% and 3.86% of the dose in feces) are not observed in nonclinical 
species. In humans, a mean of 85.8% of the dose was recovered in faeces and 4.09% of the dose was 
recovered in urine, indicating that excretion in humans is similar to that in rats and monkeys. Tucatinib 
is well absorbed in humans with >70% absorption based on the sum of faecal metabolites and urine 
recovery. Excretion into breast milk was not investigated. 
Tucatinib is unlikely to induce the activity of CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 in vivo and had insignificant effect on 
CYP2B6 mRNA expression. Tucatinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 (IC50 > 25 
µM) and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 (IC50: 2.4 – 21.1 
µM). Further, the Ki for CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 is 0.170 – 4.57 µM and the inhibition 
mechanism was determined as competitive inhibition. Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and CYP2D6 was not metabolism-dependent, however, tucatinib caused metabolism-dependent 
inactivation of CYP3A. ONT-993 inhibits CYP2D6 (IC50: 7.9 µM) and causes metabolism-dependent 
inactivation of CYP3A (KI: 1.6 µM). There is low probability of a PK drug interaction for the combination 
of tucatinib or ONT-993 with capecitabine in vivo. Tucatinib was not a substrate for OAT, OCT or MATE, 
however, data suggests that tucatinib is a substrate for BCRP and P-gp. In Caco-2 cells and in MDR1 
LLC-PK1 cells, it was shown that tucatinib is a P-gp inhibitor. Furthermore, inhibition of OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT2, BCRP, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K was shown. ONT-993 is a substrate for BCRP and 
P-gp as well, and data indicate that ONT-993 may also be a potential substrate for human OATP1B3. 
ONT-993 was shown to inhibit OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K mediated transport.  
In the animal toxicity studies, increased serum enzymes, liver weights, and centilobular hypertrophy 
were found.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies have been submitted. Acute effects are described in the repeat dose 
toxicity studies.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose studies were conducted in rats via oral gavage (Study 1140-028; GLP Study 8369684) 
and in monkeys via naso-gastric (Study JAY00093; GLP study) and oral gavage (Study 8369685; GLP 
study). Administration via naso-gastric gavage is considered equivalent to administration via oral 
gavage.

Mortalities were observed in both rats and monkeys at high doses, i.e. at 120/200mg/kg/day and 90 
mg/kg/day for rats and monkeys, corresponding to a safety margin of 12 and 4.5 (Day 1 data), 
respectively. In rats, the cause of death was interpreted to be the result of gastrointestinal 
erosion/ulceration for the majority of animals with red discoloration within the GI tract, some with 
subacute inflammation. Similar effects were observed in monkeys, with clinical signs such as watery 
faeces and apparent abdominal pain. The effects were however not observed in surviving rats and 
were generally reversible. In monkeys, faecal abnormalities were observed from 5 mg/kg 
corresponding to a safety margin of 0.03. Furthermore, decreased food consumption, dehydration, 
emesis and reduced body weight was observed in both rats at ≥60 mg/kg/day and monkeys at ≥40 
mg/kg/day, presumably related to the GI effects, with observations of related changes in clinical 
chemistry parameters.  
Effects on liver was observed in all studies in both rats and monkeys at ≥6 mg/kg/day and ≥20 
mg/kg/day, respectively, primarily with increased liver weights and changes in hepatic enzymes levels 
of ALP and AST as well as changes in cholesterol and total bilirubin. The changes were minimal and 
reversible and not associated with histological changes in the liver such as necrosis or fibrosis. 
Treatment-related minimal centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in the 13-week study in female rats at 
≥20 mg/kg and swelling and cytoplasmic rarefaction of hepatocytes in the 28-days study in monkeys 
at 90 mg/kg/day were observed. In monkeys with observed changes of the hepatocytes, only 
concurrent changes in liver weight and ALP were seen, but not in ALT, AST and/or bilirubin.  
In monkeys, changes in red blood cell count with an adaptive regenerative response as well as 
increases in white blood cell count indicative of an inflammatory response was observed. These 
changes were not observed in rats and were generally reversible. 
In the 28-day study in rats (Study 1140-028) an increased incidence of myofiber 
degeneration/regeneration of the soleus muscle as well as mononuclear infiltration of the psoas muscle 
was observed in males receiving 200/120 mg/kg/dose, which was also present in the recovery group. 
The finding was however not dose-response related and was not observed in the 13-week study in rats 
nor in monkeys. It was also observed in one male rat in the control group. The finding is not 
considered of toxicological relevance. Further, increased adrenal gland was observed in the 28-day 
study in rats. The increase in adrenal gland weight was without microscopic correlates, so it was not

considered of toxicological concern. In the 13-week study in monkeys (Study 8369685), an elevated 
heart rate was observed at ≥5 mg/kg/day, however, this was not observed during ECG evaluations 
and did not correlate with other clinical observations, so it was considered incidental. Furthermore, 
increased kidney weight was observed in the 28-days study in monkeys at ≥60 mg/kg/day 
(JAY00093). At 90 mg/kg/day, minimal degeneration of tubular epithelium of the medullary rays in the 
kidney was further observed in 1 male and 2 females, which indicate kidney toxicity at high dose levels 
corresponding to a safety margin of 4.5 (D1 AUC0-12h data), however, the finding was reversible.

In the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, an increased incidence of vaginal epithelial atrophy 
was observed at 60 mg/kg/day (2/12 females) and at 90 mg/kg/day (12/12 females) with increased 
severity at the higher dose level. No changes were observed in the female recovery group. In the 13-
week study in rat, lower uterus/cervix weights were observed in females administered 60 mg/kg/day 
(reversible), which correlated with microscopic finding of minimal or slight uterine atrophy, with a 
dose-related increased incidence and severity in females administered ≥6 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, in 
the ovaries, slightly or moderately decreased corpora lutea was observed in a small number of females 
administered ≥20 mg/kg/day. Also, slight corpus luteum cyst and/or increased interstitial cells were 
observed in 2 females administered 60 mg/kg/day. Changes in the ovaries were only partly reversible. 
In the 13-week study in rats, minimal to marked lobular atrophy in the mammary gland was observed 
in males administered ≥6 mg/kg/day corresponding to safety margins of below 1, with a dose-related

increased incidence and severity, which resulted in an appearance similar to that observed for the 
female mammary gland. The effects were reversible. 
No effects on fertility were observed in monkeys and all observations in rats were reversible or partly 
reversible.  
In embryo-foetal developmental studies in rats and rabbits, treatment related developmental 
variations and malformations were observed. In rats, maternal toxicity was observed at ≥90 
mg/kg/day as decreased body weight and body weight gain as well as reduced food consumption. At 
≥90 mg/kg/day, decreased the mean number of implantations, total number of foetuses, and mean 
number of live foetuses, as well as decreased percent of pre- and post-implantation loss and total 
number of resorptions was observed. At ≥120 mg/kg/day, mean foetal body weights were reduced and 
a correlating reduction in mean foetal ossification sites resulting in reduced mean number of hindlimb 
tarsals and phalanges, forelimb phalanges and metatarsals was observed. Tucatinib administration also 
resulted in an increased incidence of skeletal variations that however lacked a consistent dose-
relationship and only a few litters were affected. In rats, developmental effects occurred at maternally 
toxic doses, where no NOAEL could be established for maternal effects and with a developmental 
NOAEL of 90 mg/kg/day corresponding to a safety margin of 3. 
In rabbits, decreases in food consumption were correlated with reductions in maternal body weight 
gains and body weight at ≥120 mg/kg/day. At ≥90 mg/kg/day, an increase in the number of late 
resorptions, total number of resorptions, and percent post-implantation loss was observed as well as a 
reduction in number of live foetuses and percent male foetuses. At ≥90 mg/kg/day, several external 
and visceral abnormalities was observed as well as skeletal abnormalities that included domed head 
malformations, severe brain dilation, incompletely ossified frontals and parietals, and a hole in the 
parietal region of the skull. In rabbits, foetal toxicity occurred at maternally non-toxic dose levels with 
a maternal NOAEL of 60 mg/kg, which corresponds to a safety margin of 0.36 based on AUC.  
Studies investigating prenatal and postnatal development were not submitted.

Other toxicity studies 
Tucatinib and ONT-993 both show absorption in the UVA region 315-400 nm, which is indicative of a 
photoreactive potential. Tucatinib and ONT-993 were investigated in the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake 
Phototoxicity Test, where both compounds were considered to have a phototoxic potential. Tucatinib 
and ONT-933 were then tested in vivo in Crl:LE (Long-Evans) pigmented female rats to determine the 
potential phototoxic effects of tucatinib on the eyes and skin, as distribution studies have shown a 
potential for tucatinib to accumulate in pigmented tissue. In doses up to 60 mg/kg/day tucatinib, no 
phototoxic potential was observed for either cutaneous or ocular reactions.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Tucatinib is a potent inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-targeted small 
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  
The potency and selectivity of tucatinib alone were evaluated in vitro using biochemical and cellular 
signalling assays and the anti-tumour activity of tucatinib was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in mouse 
tumour allo- and xenograft models. Tucatinib inhibited phosphorylation, cell signaling, and proliferation 
in vitro, and demonstrated anti-tumour activity alone and in combination with trastuzumab or 
docetaxel in HER2 amplified tumour xenograft models. Tucatinib demonstrated activity in a mouse

intracranial HER2 amplified tumour xenograft model. However, limited distribution of tucatinib to brain 
tissues was found in the pharmacokinetics assays (see also further down). It was also shown that 
combinations with tucatinib and docetaxel or trastuzumab resulted in antitumor activity in terms of 
improvement in regressions and tumour-free survivors. From a nonclinical point of view, exposure-
response relationship and the posology (continuous BID dosing) in patients are justified. In vitro and in 
vivo proof of concept is considered well established. 
Tucatinib was investigated in a kinase assay where binding to other non-target receptors was not 
detected. A bibliographical review on the potential of tucatinib and ONT-993 to interact with other 
targets besides kinases, including receptors, ion channels, neurotransmitters and peptides, together 
with available non-clinical studies conducted with tucatinib, suggest the absence of off-target effects 
upon tucatinib administration. 
In terms of safety pharmacology, tucatinib appeared selective for the intended HER2 tyrosine kinase 
target, showed low potential for interaction with cardiovascular targets (hERG, Human Embryonic 
Kidney (HEK293) Cells) and showed no clinically relevant adverse effects in the in vivo CV safety study 
in monkey. However, the calculated IC50 value is higher than the concentrations tested in the assay. 
Though the potential concomitant toxicity of tucatinib and trastuzumab was not addressed in non-
clinical in vivo models, concomitant toxicity was, however, studied in the clinical study HER2CLIMB, 
where an increased incidence of adverse cardiac events in the combination treatment arm did not 
occur. No indication of impact on respiratory system was revealed in rat, nor in the CNS safety study in 
rats.  
Tucatinib was also tested in a series of gastrointestinal studies to elucidate potential safety issues. In a 
gastric section study in rats, increase total gastric secretion volume and acidity of gastric secretion was 
observed, however, the intestinal transit was not affected by tucatinib in a charcoal propulsion test in 
rats. At high doses, tucatinib was shown to induce a significant increase in number of lesions, length 
and total score as well as the percentage of animals which developed lesions. Substantial gastric 
irritation, in line with similar findings observed in the toxicology studies, was detected upon tucatinib 
administration. The underlying cause for the observed gastrointestinal findings is unknown, however, it 
appears unlikely that EGFR might play a role in the gastrointestinal toxicity mainly due to the shown 
selectivity of tucatinib for HER2. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (ADME) of tucatinib was evaluated in nonclinical species used for pharmacology 
and safety testing of tucatinib (mouse, rat, rabbit and monkey). The PK after both single and repeat 
dosing appear well described in rodents. In rats and mice, a nonlinear and greater than dose 
proportional relationship was observed with signs of accumulation. Large variations in exposure was 
observed in the monkey, and the applicant was requested to provide further discussions to clarify the 
trend towards linearity and dose proportionality after single and repeat dosing. The applicant stated 
that drug-metabolising enzymes or transporters may have played a lesser role for the variability of 
monkey PK/TK profiles than solubility in the solution-based formulation, which is accepted. 
Distribution was evaluated in adult rats, however, in line with ICH S9 distribution in pregnant and 
nursing rats was not described. Potential accumulation was observed in pigmented tissue, specifically 
in eye and uveal tract, where tucatinib was still measured in significant amounts after 672 h. However, 
no relevant effects were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies or in an in vivo phototoxicity study, 
so as the finding did not give rise to toxicological concern, the issue was concluded resolved.  
When the distribution of tucatinib was addressed in studies involving radiolabelled compound 
administration, it was evident that the brain distribution of radioactivity was limited in rats and mice 
with intracerebral tumours. Distribution in brain metastasis could be evaluated for other HER2 tyrosine 
Assessment report

Page 35/148 
 
 
 
kinase inhibitors by using imaging techniques. However, the applicant argued that the penetration of 
tucatinib in brain metastases might be influenced by several factors and that PET imaging could not be 
performed with tucatinib mainly due to structural differences in comparison with other TKIs, not 
allowing synthesizing [11C] tucatinib. The justification was accepted by the CHMP.  
It has been suggested that an adaptive response of the liver triggered by the induction of liver 
enzymes upon tucatinib treatment might be responsible for some findings observed in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies (increased liver weights and changes in hepatic enzymes levels of ALP and AST as well 
as changes in cholesterol and total bilirubin). However, no changes in the enzymatic activity were 
detected and no increases of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A mRNA levels were seen in PK drug interaction 
studies. The relationships between the toxic findings and the results of the metabolism assays were 
discussed by the applicant, who argues that rats are more susceptible than humans towards enzymatic 
induction and that the results in the rat studies are of limited clinical relevance.  
It appears that two human in vivo metabolites (M18 and M28, accounting for 6.07% and 3.86% of the 
dose in feces) are not observed in nonclinical species. However, according to ICH S9, metabolites only 
observed in humans does not need to be qualified in nonclinical species. Furthermore, the metabolites 
are present below 10% and are thus only considered minor metabolites. Taking the indication for 
advance cancer into consideration, the lack of any characterisation of these two minor metabolites are 
accepted. 
In the DDI studies IC50 values for substrate and transporter assessments have been calculated. 
According to ‘Guideline on the investigation of Drug Interactions’, (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 
2**), the IC50 must only be used if the derivation of Ki is not possible and the in vitro study design 
should demonstrate linear conditions and a lack of time dependency of inhibition. Using the Cheng-
Prusoff equation Ki would be nearly equivalent to the IC50 value and further, pre-incubation of cells 
with tucatinib was performed to take potential time dependency of inhibition into account. The use of 
IC50 values are therefore acceptable. 
Toxicology 
The pharmacological relevance of the toxicological species was discussed by the applicant and taking 
sequence homology information as well as a justification based on historical use (rat) and higher oral 
tolerability (monkey) into account, the chosen species were considered acceptable. 
The toxicology package presented is in line with the requirements under the relevant guidelines (ICH 
S9 for an advanced cancer indication) and with due consideration to the proposed posology. No single 
dose toxicology studies were conducted which is considered acceptable. Repeat-dose toxicology studies 
in rats and cynomolgus monkeys showed primarily effects on liver presumably as an adaptive response 
to enzyme induction and GI at safety margins below 1 i.e. at clinically relevant doses leading to weight 
loss, dehydration and emesis. Similar findings were observed in clinical studies and are included in the 
SmPC section 4.8. 
Kidney toxicity was observed in monkeys at high dose levels, which was however reversible. In clinical 
trials, an increase in serum creatinine has been observed in patients treated with tucatinib due to 
inhibition of renal tubular transport of creatinine (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Tucatinib is not of genotoxic potential. It was not investigated for carcinogenicity in accordance with 
ICH S9. Tucatinib was shown to have effects on female fertility in repeat dose toxicology studies, and 
in embryo-fetal developmental studies in rat and rabbit, tucatinib was teratogenic at clinically relevant 
dose levels. Studies investigating prenatal and postnatal development were not submitted. This is 
acceptable according to ICH S9. Additional consideration should be given to toxic observations in the 
female reproductive organs and male mammary gland and prostate. While no findings were noted in 
both cynomolgus monkey studies, toxic observations were described in the rat studies. Inherent 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 36/148 
 
 
 
differences between species might account for the differential phenotypic reproductive findings. The 
observations have been included accordingly in the SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3.  
Though tucatinib is distributed and accumulated in the brain and exerts pharmacologically mediated 
inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation in CNS implanted tumour tissue, no dependence related findings 
were observed in the repeat-dose studies, and the issue is considered of limited relevance.  
A PBT pre-screening was conducted for tucatinib. The experimentally determined LogKow value was 
below the trigger value of 4.5 according to EMA guidance on ERA (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2, 
01 June 2006) indicating no concern for bioaccumulation. However, the predicted and refined PECsurface 
water values exceed the action limit of 0.01 µg/L according to EMA guidance. Investigations showed that 
tucatinib is very persistent. Based on the phase I assessment, a phase II tier A assessment is 
triggered. 
GLP compliant OECD tests were carried out according to the EMA guidance and PNEC values for surface 
water, ground water and microorganisms were derived from the identified NOEC values. The PEC/PNEC 
ratio remained below the trigger value for all compartments. However, investigations in sewage sludge 
showed a Kd >3700 L/kg and Koc >10000 L/kg and combined with the property of not readily 
biodegradable, effects assessments of tucatinib on the terrestrial compartment in a Tier IIB 
assessment is triggered. Furthermore, logPow at pH 9 was 3.94, thus triggering further investigation of 
potential bioaccumulation in a fish bioconcentration study. Finally, sediment degradation data showed 
partitioning to the sediment layer, thus a risk assessment for sediment dwelling organisms is triggered. 
In the tier IIB assessment, GLP compliant OECD studies were conducted to investigate fate and effects 
on the terrestrial compartment according to EMA guidance on ERA. Risk assessments showed that no 
risk is identified for the terrestrial compartment. However, the study on aerobic soil transformation 
(OECD 307) showed that tucatinib is very consistent in soil. No risk of bioaccumulation and secondary 
poisoning was identified based on the bioconcentration study in fish. The studies on Lumbiculus toxicity 
(OECD 25) and Chironomid toxicity (OECD 218) resulted in an acceptable risk for sediment dwelling 
species. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An adequate program of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology was conducted in disease models for 
tucatinib, supporting the intended clinical use of tucatinib. Nonclinical proof of concept as a HER2-
targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor appear well-established and provided documentation suggesting a 
lack of off-target binding of tucatinib. Pharmacokinetics of tucatinib is well described in rodents. The 
toxicological programme of tucatinib was conducted in rats and monkeys, where liver and GI effect 
were primarily observed. No genotoxic potential was identified, however, tucatinib affects female 
fertility and showed foetal toxicity at clinically relevant doses. Relevant information is included in the 
SmPC sections 4.6, 4.8 and 5.3.  
Overall the nonclinical part of the dossier is considered approvable. The risks to the environment have 
been assessed in line with existing guidelines and the outcome of the assessment is acceptable.

The clinical pharmacology profile of tucatinib was characterised based on the results of 11 clinical 
studies. Seven of the clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects and characterised the clinical 
pharmacology of tucatinib.

In addition to the clinical pharmacology studies, several models were developed, including a Population 
PK model using data from the pivotal phase 3 study HER2CLIMB, a patient factor covariate analysis of 
HER2CLIMB data, an exposure response analysis of HER2CLIMB data, and a fit-for-purpose and 
mechanistic physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model using available in vitro and in vivo 
data. 
Absorption  
The absorption of tucatinib has been quantified in subjects with and without cancer in single-dose and 
repeat-dose administration regimens. The Coefficient of variation demonstrates various degrees of 
inter-subject variation across all studies, mostly moderate to high. The model-predicted Cmax is 630 
ng/ml in the target population in a repeat-dose regimen. Tmax is about 2 hours (range 1 to 4 hours; 
single dose of 300 mg). 
The PK variability was high for the PIC (powder in capsule) formulation used in ARRAY-380-101 study. 
To overcome the variability of the PIC formulation, the tablet formulation was developed. The tablet 
formulation was evaluated in healthy volunteers in ARRAY-380-103 study. Bioequivalence was not 
demonstrated for the PK-parameters AUCinf and AUClast as the upper bound of the 90%CI did not fall 
within the 80-125% no-difference criteria. The tablet formulation had lower inter-subject variability 
compared to the PIC formulation and has been used in all subsequent additional studies, except a 
radiolabelled formulation used in ONT-380-008. A10% increase in AUC, was seen for capsules in fasted 
state when compared to tablets. It is expected that the slight increase in AUC is of minor relevance in 
healthy subjects, although its impact in cancer patients is unknown.  
Concomitant administration with the PPI omeprazole, indicated less than a 15% difference in AUCinf, 
AUClast and Cmax and findings were not statistically significant when compared to tucatinib 
administered without omeprazole.  
Influence of food 
The geometrical mean tucatinib Cmax was about 8% and up to 36 % higher in the fed state compared 
to the fasted state. The geometrical mean tucatinib Tmax appeared after 4 hours during fed state 
compared to 1,5 hours in fasted state. The total tucatinib exposure was increased 48% and up to 75 % 
when tucatinib was administered with food.

EMA/78409/2021  
Page 42/148 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Vd was 1670 L in healthy volunteers after administration of a single dose. Pop-PK-predicted Vd in 
subjects with breast cancer at steady state was 730 L. 
In vitro assessment demonstrated that 97.1% of tucatinib was bound to plasma proteins in human 
plasma at 1 µM tucatinib concentration and mean plasma protein binding of ONT-993 was 97.1% at 5 
μM tucatinib concentration. Additionally, In vitro blood-to-plasma partitioning of tucatinib in human 
blood samples suggested that a similar portion tucatinib resides in the blood and plasma 
compartments.  
In ONT-380-008 study (Mass balance study), low association of tucatinib with red blood cells was seen. 
The geometric mean blood/plasma total radioactivity AUC ratios were 0.557 (based on AUC0-∞) and 
0.508 (based on AUC0-t), respectively.  
Tucatinib is a substrate of P-gp, which would expect to limit distribution to CNS but reduced number of 
efflux transporters, acidic interstitial pH and leaky tight junctions enhance tucatinib permeability into 
the tumour.  
Metabolism 
Seventeen metabolites of tucatinib has been identified/characterised in humans. From these nine 
metabolites are unknown and found in very low quantities. Tucatinib and the major metabolite ONT-
993 were the most abundant compounds accounting for 79.7% and 9.65% of total plasma radioactivity 
(AUC0-24h), respectively. According to non-clinical data the predominant circulating metabolite ONT-993 
has a potency corrected exposure of less than 10% of tucatinib.  
Tucatinib is primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (75 %) and by a minor degree by CYP3A (10 %). 
Aldehyde oxidase was determined to comprise approximately 15% of total tucatinib metabolism.  
Elimination 
Tucatinib is primarily eliminated by metabolism through the hepatobiliary route. Approximately 85.8% 
of a radio-labelled dose was recovered in faeces (15.9% as unchanged tucatinib), and 4.09% was 
recovered in urine. The cumulated percentage of tucatinib excreted in urine was less than 1%. Half-
lives of tucatinib was 7.13 hours in healthy volunteers and pop-PK predicted T½ was 14.9 hours in the 
typical breast cancer subject.  
In non-clinical studies, tucatinib appeared to be a substrate of P-gp and the influence of this efflux 
transporter has been investigated using digoxin as probe. The mass balance study suggested that 
tucatinib is not absorbed and subsequently excreted as unchanged drug in the intestines.  
A significant reduction in CL/F (56.3%) was estimated in patients with tablet combination therapy. The 
greater decrease in CL/F seems to be related to other factors that could not be individually identified.  
Dose proportionality  
In the dose-escalation study ONT-380-001, the dose range 25 mg BID to 800 mg BID was 
investigated. The data on dose-proportionality suggested increasing exposure with increasing dose. 
However, due to dispersion of exposures within each dose- category, broad confidence intervals of 
90% CIs for each dose did not lie completely within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 43/148 
 
 
 
Geometric mean exposure tended to increase with increasing dose suggesting linearity between 
tucatinib dose and exposure at therapeutic doses. 
Figure 3a: 
A dose proportionality assessment demonstrated a linear relationship between exposure metrics (Cmax 
and AUC) throughout the dose levels evaluated at Day 1 and Day 14. The statistical assessment 
demonstrated a slope close to the unity, confirming the linear relationship. 
Accumulation and time dependencies 
In the study ONT-308-004 accumulation of tucatinib was evaluated by comparing plasma 
concentrations of tucatinib obtained in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 at doses ranging between 150 and 350 mg 
tucatinib BID. For the 300 mg dose, a 1.54- and 1.70-fold accumulation was seen for Cmax and AUC0-
6, respectively. Similar findings were provided for the 300 mg dose by the pop-PK model, with 
accumulation of 1.72-fold and 1.52-fold for AUC and Cmax respectively. These accumulation ratios 
support the proposed dosing regimen of 300 mg tucatinib BID. 
Tucatinib trough concentrations were consistent across Cycles 2 to 4 in the study ONT-380-004, thus 
time-dependency of tucatinib PK is not demonstrated.  
Inter-and inter-individual variability 
Various degrees of variability in tucatinib and ONT-993 PK parameters have been demonstrated in 
healthy volunteers and in the target population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Three phase 1 studies were conducted in subjects with breast cancer (ONT-380-004, ONT380-005, 
ARRAY-380-101).  These studies were included in a pop-PK analysis along two studies in healthy 
volunteers (ARRAY-380-103 and ONT-380-012). The Pop-PK analysis provided predicted PK 
parameters for the target population including Cmax of 630 ng/ml, Cthrough of 257 ng/ml and AUC of 
5234 ng*h/ml. 
The model predicted an increased tucatinib AUC of 2.29-fold (and up to 4.32-fold) an increased 
tucatinib Cmax of 1.84-fold (and up to 3.16-fold) in the target population during concomitant 
treatment with T-DM1 or capecitabine with or without trastuzumab, compared to healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Based on pop-PK modelling data race, weight and age were not identified as being predictors of 
tucatinib PK.  
The effect of gender was not evaluated during the covariate analysis on any of the PK parameters 
because of the lack of male patients in studies ONT-380-004 and ONT-380-005. The non-
compartmental comparison of study ONT-380-012 showed higher exposure in females compared to 
male subjects, with a >20% increase in AUCinf and <20% increase in Cmax. Only two men were 
included in analysis and the effect of gender could not be established. 
No subjects older than 80 years were included and therefore predictions on subjects >80 years are 
extrapolations.  
In SGNTUC-015, no marked differences in AUC between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. No data 
was collected in children in line with the PDCO decision.   
In ONT-380-008, < 5% of the total radioactivity was excreted in urine and cumulated percentage of 
tucatinib excreted in urine was less than 1%. Additionally, an exploratory pharmacokinetic (PK) 
analysis using through-samples from the HER2CLIMB study found that mild or moderate impaired renal 
function did not affect tucatinib Ctrough levels in the target population. No subjects with severe 
impaired renal function or end-stage renal disease were included in the analysis. Increase serum 
creatinine levels following repeat dosing of tucatinib has been demonstrated.  
In SGNTUC-020 iohexol exposure was unaffected by of tucatinib, demonstrating that GFR is not 
impacted by repeat dosing of tucatinib. The dose selected of iohexol (5 mL of iohexol IV, 300 mg 
iodine per mL of solution) appeared slightly low according to SmPC recommendation and dose used in 
other studies, but the dose was sufficient to capture the intended data.  
ONT-380-009 investigated tucatinib exposure in volunteers with different degrees of impaired hepatic 
function (mild-severe classified by using the Child-Pugh system).  Even though less than a two-fold 
increase in geometrical mean exposure was seen across different stages of impaired hepatic function, 
up to a 3.7-fold increase in tucatinib Cmax and 3.8-fold increase in AUC was observed in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, when compared to Healthy volunteers (Table 15). However, these 
differences did not reach statistical significance because of the high variability in plasma 
concentrations.

The exploratory pop-PK analysis using through samples from the HER2CLIMB study did not identify 
impaired hepatic function as a predictor of tucatinib PK, but no subjects with severe impaired hepatic 
function were included in the analysis (Figure 3b).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies / Pharmacokinetics using human 
biomaterials 
Tucatinib and ONT-993 interactions have been investigated in-vitro, in-silico and in-vivo.  
In ONT-380-012 study tucatinib as victim was investigated. Concomitant treatment with tucatinib and 
itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) caused approximately a 1.4-fold increase in tucatinib 
exposure, with a slightly higher exposure to ONT-993. These findings are not considered of clinically 
relevant magnitude. 
Concomitant treatment with tucatinib and rifampicin (a CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inducer) reduced tucatinib 
exposure by half and caused up to a 2.5-fold increase in ONT-993 Cmax.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 47/148 
 
 
 
 
 
A Pop-PK model of tucatinib was developed to account for the impact of CYP3A4 inducers on the 
exposures of tucatinib after single or multiple dose regimen of tucatinib. The results suggested that the 
predicted impact on the exposure of tucatinib of CYP3A4 inducers is negligible when tucatinib is 
administered in a multiple dose regimen. No clinically significant DDIs are expected when co-
administered tucatinib with a moderate inducer of CYP3A4. 
Concomitant treatment with tucatinib and gemfibrozil (strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) caused a 3-fold 
increase in tucatinib exposure and decreased ONT-993 exposure. The effect of moderate CYP2C8 
inhibitors was assessed in a Pop-PK model with rosiglitazone as a CYP2C8 substrate in the presence of 
two virtual moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors using gemfibrozil and its metabolite as a reference. The DDI 
study simulated with these virtual moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors revealed a 1.98- or 3.08-fold increase 
in tucatinib AUC (for the inhibitors reproducing the accepted lower and upper, respectively) and less 
than 2-fold increase in Cmax in both scenarios. These results are in line with those observed in DDI 
clinical trials and are expected not to be clinically meaningful. 
Table 16: 
Tucatinib as perpetrator was also investigated in ONT-380-012. Tucatinib did not cause clinically 
relevant PK changes in the CYP2C9 substrate tolbutamide.  
Concomitant treatment with tucatinib and repaglinide caused about a 1.7-fold increased exposure to 
repaglinide. This interaction is not considered of clinically relevant magnitude.  
A non-compartmental PK comparison has showed negligible changes in exposure of tolbutamide in the 
presence of tucatinib.  
Tucatinib caused a 5.7-fold increased exposure to CYP3A4 substrate midazolam with a 3-fold increase 
in Cmax, thereby demonstrating that tucatinib is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.  
Tucatinib caused about a 1.5-fold increase in digoxin exposure and a 2.4-fold increase in digoxin 
Cmax. Since digoxin is a narrow-therapeutic interval drug, alterations in PK due to concomitant use of 
tucatinib may increase the risk of toxicity.  
In SGNTUC-020 about a 1.4-fold increased exposure to the MATE1/2-k substrate metformin was seen 
when co-administered with tucatinib. This interaction is not considered of clinically relevant magnitude.

Table 17: 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action and primary pharmacology 
Tucatinib is small molecule that belongs to the class of EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In-vitro studies have 
demonstrated that tucatinib is a potent, human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER2)-specific tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor that is highly selective towards HER2. 
Tucatinib inhibits the intracellular HER2-driven MAP and PI3 kinase signalling pathways (Figure 4), 
thereby inhibiting proliferation, survival and metastasis of the tumour cell. It is not clear whether the 
mechanism of action imply risk of development of resistance to endocrine-based therapy and thereby 
lack of efficacy, but preclinical data suggest that resistance to anti-HER2-targeted therapies via 
upregulation of the ER pathway can be suppressed by the addition of endocrine therapy and in the 
clinical setting.

Secondary Pharmacology 
The effect of tucatinib in human cardiac repolarisation has been investigated in ONT-380-011 
conducted in accordance with the ICH E14 guidelines. The study was a cross-over study conducted in 
healthy volunteers. Subjects received a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin on the day of ECG 
investigation or tucatinib 300 mg BID or placebo for four days prior to ECG investigation during the 
three study periods. The cardiac repolarisation was investigated by using continuous ECG up to 36 
hours postdose. QT intervals were corrected for heart rate by using Fredericia’s correction. The 
analysis was conducted by using a 'by-timepoint' analysis. The moxifloxacin positive control 
demonstrated sensitivity as the lower bound of the 90% CI of ΔΔQTcF was more than 5 msec 1-24 
hours postdose. Tucatinib mean ΔΔQTcF ranged between-2.9 msec at 2 hours postdose to 0.0 msec at 
4 hours postdose. The upper bound of the 90% CI of ΔΔQTcF remained below 5 msec at all postdose 
timepoints. No hysteresis was demonstrated.  It was found that the effect of tucatinib 300 mg BID on 
ECG parameters was similar to that of placebo. Since tucatinib ΔΔQTcF ranged between-2.9 msec and 
0.0 msec and the upper bound of the confidence intervals did not exceed 5 msec, no clinically relevant 
changes in cardiac repolarisation was observed.

Dose justification 
The 300 mg BID dosing regimen, as recommended phase 2 dose, was determined in ONT-380-005 
study based on safety findings. The HER2CLIMB data demonstrated that, tucatinib dosed at 300 mg 
BID in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab resulted in clinically meaningful prolongation of 
PFS and OS.

Table 18: 
The safety analysis indicated that drug-induced liver injury, cerebral oedema not attributable to 
progression of disease, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction leading to dose modification or 
discontinuation were not associated with tucatinib exposure (Table 22). Tucatinib is considered to have 
contributed to increased incidences of diarrhoea, PPE, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis. Those AEs 
were not associated with increasing tucatinib exposure. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of tucatinib has been investigated in a comprehensive development program including studies 
in healthy subjects and in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The pharmacology programme 
comprised 11 clinical pharmacology studies and population PK modelling. Furthermore, data from the 
phase 3 study was included for some of the analyses.  
Validated and cross-validated LC-MS/MS methods were used for quantification of tucatinib and ONT-
993 in the development programme. Results were presented using descriptive statistics and data were 
analysed after log-transformation using linear mixed effect statistical methods and the ratio of mean 
differences and associated 90% CIs were calculated for evaluation of comparability or effect.   
In the popPK model, the residual error model was characterised using a combined error model with a 
fixed additive and a proportional error term. The applicant conducted requested analysis with an 
additive residual error using log-transformed data, showing that no significant change was observed 
when log-transformed observations are considered. Therefore, the use of a combined error model with 
fixed additive error term and estimated proportional error term seems adequate to characterise the 
overall performance of tucatinib over time. 
A significant change to standard allometric exponents was observed in the popPK model. The 
covariate-parameter relationship is basically dependent on the available data, which surprisingly leads 
to assume a different weight effect for the elimination and distribution clearance. The suggestion to 
include the standard allometric exponents was intended to reduce the number of estimated parameters 
and increase model stability and parsimony. The applicant performed requested model comparison 
using estimated and standard allometric exponents which showed a slightly better performance of 
estimated allometric exponents compared to the use of fixed allometric exponents. The use of 
estimated allometric exponents has been adequately justified.

The pop-PK model underpredicted the highest concentrations in studies ARRAY-380-103 and ONT-380-
012 conducted in healthy male subjects, whereas the model performed acceptably in studies with 
cancer patients (both males and females). Differences in the absorption phase between healthy 
subjects (Studies ARRAY-380-103 and ONT-380-012) and cancer patients (Studies ARRAY-380-101, 
ONT-380-004 and ONT-380-005) were observed, which could demonstrate the lack of capability of the 
model to capture differences between both sub-groups of individuals. However, the safety of the 
proposed dosing regimen has been characterised in the cancer population. Reported AE’s appear to be 
manageable and in line with those observed with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see also below). 
The elimination phase after single dose administration (assuming no steady-state conditions) seemed 
to be over-estimated (mainly in studies with healthy volunteers), suggesting that an additional 
peripheral compartment would help to better describe the Cmax region and elimination phase of these 
studies. The structural part of the population PK model is highly relevant for the estimation of PK 
endpoints and prospective dose selection in other sub-groups of patients. The contribution of using a 
3-compartment model did not statistically or visually change the overall performance of the model. The 
inclusion of the third distribution compartment into the population PK model was not able to solve the 
minor discrepancies in the terminal phase of tucatinib’s concentrations. This was however considered 
not crucial for the understanding of the tucatinib’s elimination.   
No data on absolute bioavailability were provided and concomitant administration with the PPI or food 
altered the tucatinib exposure, but the differences observed were not of clinically relevant magnitudes. 
No dose adjustment is required when tucatinib co-administered with PPIs (SmPC section 4.5).  
Fasted vs. fed state:  The increase in exposure in fed state raised concerns of increased risk of toxicity 
among subject with high exposure. However, lack of an exposure-safety relationship in the pivotal 
HER2CLIMB study justifies the administration of tucatinib without regard to food. 
Metabolism by CYP2C8 is the major route of tucatinib elimination accounting for 75% of tucatinib 
metabolism. Since several metabolic pathways are involved in the tucatinib metabolism, variability in 
tucatinib exposure due to variability in a single pathway is anticipated to be low.  
Large variation indicated that PK alterations in some patients might be of clinically relevant magnitude. 
It was concluded that the large inter-individual variability on Vc/F is related to other covariates that 
were not evaluated in the model or measured during the study. However, additional concerns have 
been detected regarding other elements of the population PK model that could explain the large inter-
individual variability on Vc/F. Some factors like hepatic function and food effect, affect tucatinib 
exposure but the model-predicted differences in exposure cannot be fully explained. However, the 
safety of the proposed dosing regimen has been characterised in the cancer population. Reported AE’s 
appear to be manageable and in line with those observed with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  
Likewise, a significant reduction in CL/F (56.3%) was estimated in patients with tablet combination 
therapy. The greater decrease in CL/F also seems to be related to other factors that could not be 
individually identified.  
Large volume of distribution indicates substantial tissue distribution of tucatinib. Tucatinib is a 
substrate of P-gp, which would expect to limit distribution to CNS, however reduced number of efflux 
transporters, acidic interstitial pH and leaky tight junctions enhance tucatinib permeability into the 
tumour.  
CYP2C8 is the major route of metabolism accounting for approximately 75%, but no data on genetic 
polymorphisms have been provided. However, since several metabolic pathways are involved in the 
tucatinib metabolism, variability in tucatinib exposure due to variability in a single pathway is 
anticipated to be low. Information that co-administration of tucatinib with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors

such as gemfibrozil should be avoided as this may result in increased risk of tucatinib toxicity is 
included in the SmPC (section 4.5). 
The data on dose-proportionality suggested increasing exposure with increasing dose. A dose 
proportionality assessment demonstrated a linear relationship between exposure metrics (Cmax and 
AUC) throughout the dose levels evaluated at Day 1 and Day 14. The statistical assessment 
demonstrated a slope close to the unity, confirming the linear relationship. 
Based on pop-PK modelling data race, weight and age were not identified as being predictors of 
tucatinib PK. However, only two men were included in analysis and the effect of gender could not be 
established. Additionally, no subjects older than 80 years were included and therefore predictions on 
subjects >80 years are extrapolations. Likewise, tucatinib has not been investigated in subjects with 
severe impaired renal function or End-Stage Renal Disease. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC 
section 4.2; no dose adjustment is required in patients aged ≥ 65 years.  
Increase in serum creatinine has been observed in patients treated with tucatinib, but in SGNTUC-020 
iohexol exposure was unaffected by of tucatinib, demonstrating that GFR is not impacted by repeat 
dosing of tucatinib. No dose adjustment is necessary in mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
Even though less than a two-fold increase in geometrical mean exposure was seen across different 
stages of impaired hepatic function, up to a 3.7-fold increase in tucatinib Cmax and 3.8-fold increase in 
AUC was observed in all patients with severe hepatic impairment. These differences did not reach 
statistical significance because of the high variability. In the proposed SmPC, dose-adjustments are 
recommended in patients with severe impaired hepatic function, but no dose adjustment is needed in 
patients with moderate impaired hepatic function as no dose-response relationship between tucatinib 
exposure and AEs has been established and patients experiencing AEs due to high exposure are 
manged by dose-adjustment anyway. 
Drug-drug interactions has been widely investigated in clinical studies. No interactions of clinically 
relevant magnitude were seen with itraconazole, tolbutamide, repaglinide or metformin. 
The CYP3A/CYP2C8 inducer rifampicin reduced tucatinib exposure by half and according to the 
proposed SmPC the combinations should be avoided. Moderate CYP3A/CYP2C8 inducers is not 
expected to have clinically relevant impact on tucatinib exposure. This is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.5. 
The interaction between repaglinide and tucatinib was not considered of clinically relevant magnitude 
and no recommendations are needed in the SmPC.  
Tucatinib caused a 5.7-fold increase in midazolam exposure and according to the proposed SmPC, 
concomitant use of tucatinib and sensitive CYP3A substrates should be avoided and if the combination 
is unavoidable dose-adjustment of the CYP3A4 substrate and increased monitoring is recommended. 
Tucatinib is a P-gp inhibitor and caused an increase of 1.5-fold in digoxin exposure. The isolated effect 
on intestinal P-gp has not been demonstrated. Therefore, a caution for the DDI risk with sensitive 
intestinal P-gp substrates using dabigatran as an example, have been inserted in the SmPC section 4.4 
and 4.5. 
Tucatinib is a HER2-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for HER2-positive breast cancer. 
Tucatinib selectively inhibits HER2 which seems to enable inhibition of HER2 while potentially 
minimising AEs. The relationship between exposure and response was evaluated using HER2CLIMB 
data. In this study the 300 mg BID dosing regimen was used. Exposure-repose was evaluated by 
assessing quartiles of mean through concentrations obtained at day 1 of treatment cycle 3. 
Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analyses of PFS was conducted by assessing quartiles of mean through

concentrations across treatment cycles 2-6. A clear exposure-response relationship could not be 
established based on the HER2CLIMB data, but the findings indicated that variation in exposure in the 
300 mg BID dosing regimen does not affect PFS. The applicant was encouraged to perform a time-to-
event analysis to better characterise the exposure-efficacy relationship, however due to limitation of 
data this was not feasible. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
The mechanism of action and primary pharmacology of tucatinib is adequately described. Risk of 
development of resistance to endocrine-based therapy via upregulation of the ER pathway can be 
suppressed by the addition of endocrine therapy.  Tucatinib is considered to have contributed to 
increased incidences of diarrhoea, PPE, nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis, but a clear relationship 
between tucatinib exposure and incidence of these AEs has not been demonstrated.  
The rationale behind the clinical dose setting and dosing interval of 300 mg BID tucatinib in 
combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab seems reasonable when assessing the PK, safety and 
efficacy findings. 
The dosing recommendations and information related to the DDIs have been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK of tucatinib has been adequately evaluated in a comprehensive clinical pharmacology 
program.

Treatments 
Capecitabine is given at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID for Days 1-14 only of a 21-day cycle. As capecitabine is 
an oral drug available in fixed doses, the dose administered may not exactly match the calculated 
dose. Determination of the rounding of capecitabine doses for administration are made according to 
local institutional practices, with documentation of both the calculated and administered dose. 
Trastuzumab is given as a loading dose of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg q3wk. A loading dose of 
trastuzumab was not given to subjects who had received trastuzumab within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 
1; these subjects received trastuzumab at 6 mg/kg each cycle, including Cycle 1. Trastuzumab may 
also be given on a weekly basis at 2 mg/kg IV q1wk, but only if the trastuzumab infusion has been 
delayed and weekly infusions are required to resynchronise the cycle length to 21 days (and after 
discussion with the medical monitor). Trastuzumab infusion rates are per institutional guidelines. If 
dosing of trastuzumab is held for >4 weeks, the IV loading dose of 8 mg/kg is given per approved 
dosing instructions. 
Trastuzumab may be administered subcutaneously at 600 mg q3wk. Subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab 
does not require a loading dose nor is a weekly schedule available for the SC formulation. Subjects are 
permitted to transition from IV trastuzumab to SC trastuzumab or from SC to IV trastuzumab.

Tucatinib drug product and placebo are supplied by the study sponsor as yellow round-shaped 50 
mg tablets and yellow oval-shaped 150 mg tablets for PO administration. Placebo tablets do not 
contain the active ingredient but are identical in appearance to active tablets to maintain blinding. 
Tucatinib was given orally as a 300 mg dose twice daily (BID). 
Capecitabine was given as the chemotherapy monotherapy backbone at 1000 mg/m2 PO BID for Days 
1-14 only of a 21-day cycle. The study dose is less than what is recommended in the treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer in the SmPC for capecitabine i.e. 1250 mg/m2 PO BID days 1-14 of a 21-day 
cycle. The applicant has clarified that the used dose is the approved dose for combination therapy with 
lapatinib in the US and EU and that similar efficacy has been demonstrated with this dose (1000 
mg/m2) versus the single agent approved dose of 1250 mg/m2 PO BID, with less toxicity (Rossi 
2007). Moreover, the 1250 mg/m2 PO BID dosing regimen of capecitabine has not been tested in 
combination with tucatinib.  
Objectives 
Objectives pertinent to the current report describing the effect of tucatinib versus placebo in 
combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine are listed below. 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective is to assess the effect of tucatinib versus placebo in combination with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine on PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR. Efficacy assessments are 
performed once every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks on study, and then once every 9 weeks. 
Treatment continues until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or study 
closure. Subjects receiving placebo are not permitted to transition to tucatinib treatment. However, 
subjects with progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 and isolated progression in the brain may be 
eligible to continue on the same study treatment arm for clinical benefit after undergoing local therapy 
to CNS disease, with approval from the medical monitor. These subjects are considered to have PD at 
time of isolated progression in the brain for the analysis of PFS. 
Secondary Objectives 
Key Secondary Objectives: 
-To assess OS 
-To assess PFS in subjects with brain metastases at baseline (PFSBrainMets), defined as subjects with 
a history of brain metastases, current brain metastases, or equivocal brain lesions at baseline, using 
RECIST 1.1 based on BICR 
-To assess objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR 
Other Secondary Objectives: 
-To assess PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment 
-To assess objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 based on investigator assessment 
-To assess the duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR and by the investigator 
-To assess the clinical benefit rate (CBR) [stable disease (SD) or non-complete response (CR)/non-
progressive disease (PD) for ≥6 months, or best response of CR or partial response (PR)] per RECIST 
1.1 based on BICR and by the investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 60/148 
 
 
 
-To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economics based on subject health status 
collected using the EQ-5D-5L instrument and health care resources utilised in patient care 
Safety Objective 
-To assess safety and tolerability 
Pharmacokinetic Objective 
-To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tucatinib and metabolite ONT-993 when administered in 
combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab 
The primary objective is to asses PFS by blinded review for a superior efficacy for the tucatinib arm. 
Key secondary objectives are to assess OS and PFS in the subgroup of patients, who have brain 
metastases at baseline. Other secondary objectives are to assess PFS, ORR and DOR by investigator, 
CBR by blinded review and investigator. Lastly, health-related quality of life, safety and tolerability of 
tucatinib and pharmacokinetics were evaluated.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
PFS 
Progression-free survival (PFS) time defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of 
documented disease progression (as determined by BICR assessment using RECIST 1.1) or death from 
any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Key secondary endpoints 
PFSBM 
Progression-free survival (PFSBM) time in the subgroup of patients with a history of brain metastases or 
brain metastases at baseline, or with brain lesions of equivocal significance on screening MRI, defined 
as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of documented disease progression (as 
determined by BICR assessment) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
OS 
Overall survival (OS) time defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death 
from any cause. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints 
ORR 
Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as achieving a best overall response of complete (CR) or 
partial response (PR) as determined by BICR and by investigator using RECIST 1.1. 
PFSINV 
Progression-free survival (PFSINV) time defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date 
of documented disease progression (as determined by the investigator using RECIST 1.1) or death 
from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
DOR 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 61/148 
 
 
 
Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from the first objective response (CR or PR) to 
documented disease progression (PD) (as determined by BICR and by investigator using RECIST 1.1) 
or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
CBR 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR). Clinical benefit is defined as achieving stable disease (SD) or non-CR/non-
PD for ≥ 6 months or a best overall response of complete (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined 
by BICR and by investigator using RECIST 1.1. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
The patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to tucatinib and placebo arm by a dynamic hierarchical 
randomisation scheme. The randomisation was stratified by 3 factors, known history of treated or 
untreated brain metastases (yes/no), ECOG PS (0,1), and region of world (US, Canada, rest of world).   
This was a double-blinded trial. Patients, site investigators and personnel, the sponsor (except for 
designated Clinical Drug Safety (CDS) personnel), and all other individuals involved in the monitoring, 
data management, and/or conduct of the trial were blinded. Designated CDS personnel may request 
the treatment assignment of an individual subject in the event of a Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), but will not have access to the overall randomisation scheme. 
Unblinded data including deaths, discontinuations, dose reductions, adverse events (serious and non-
serious) will be monitored regularly by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The 
independent data coordinating centre preparing this output for the DMC will be unblinded and have 
access to the overall randomisation scheme. 
At the time of the primary analysis for the primary endpoint (PFS), specific sponsor personnel will be 
unblinded; however, sponsor personnel directly involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded 
to individual subject treatment assignments (tucatinib/placebo) until the final analysis for the key 
secondary endpoint of PFSBM. 
At the time of the primary analysis for PFS, part of the personnel will be unblinded, while others 
involved in the analysis of PFSBM will remain blinded. The applicant has clarified that because the trial 
met all its prespecified alpha-controlled endpoints, the Sponsor unblinded the trial to allow for cross-
over of placebo patients to the tucatinib combination treatment; as such, a blinded team was no longer 
necessary. The sponsor changed during the conduct of the study, but the integrity of the blinded data 
was maintained during the transfer of study sponsorship from Cascadian Therapeutics to Seattle 
Genetics.

Statistical methods 
Table 19: 
Analysis Sets 
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set will include all randomised subjects. Specifically, the primary 
analyses for the primary endpoint of PFS per BICR will be conducted using the first 480 randomised 
subjects in the ITT analysis set (ITT-PFS). Limiting the primary analysis only to the first 480 subjects 
avoided potential bias from early progression events in the overall population, where many of the 
subjects would have had a shorter follow-up. 
The analyses of the key secondary endpoint OS will be conducted on all the randomised subjects in the 
ITT analysis set (ITT-OS). The analysis of the key secondary endpoint PFSBM will be conducted using 
all the randomised subjects in the BM subgroup in the ITT analysis set (ITT- PFSBM).  
- The safety analysis set will include all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study 
treatment (tucatinib/placebo, capecitabine or trastuzumab).  
The ITT analysis set will include all randomised patients. For PFS, only the first 480 randomised 
patients in the ITT population were included in the primary analysis. The analysis of OS was conducted 
on all the randomised patients in the ITT. For PFSBM, all the randomised patients in the BM subgroup 
in the ITT were included in the analysis.  
Type I error control 
To maintain strong control of the family-wise type I error rate at 0.05, the PFS will be tested at 0.05 
level first in the ITT-PFS set, if it is significant, then the key secondary endpoints will be tested using 
the group sequential Holm variable procedure. One formal interim analysis for superiority is planned 
for PFSBM and two formal interim analyses for superiority are planned for OS if the primary analysis for 
PFS is statistically significant. The boundary at interim analysis is determined according to the Lan-
DeMets O’Brien- Fleming approximation spending function for two-sided tests. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 63/148 
 
 
 
 
 
Analyses of the other secondary endpoints will not be subject to formal type I error control. However, 
if both of the key secondary endpoints (OS and PFSBM) are statistically significant, then the ORR by 
BICR will be formally tested between two treatment arms. 
Figure 8: 
The primary endpoint PFS was tested at an overall alpha of 0.05. If PFS was significant, the alpha will 
be split among the key secondary endpoints PFSBM (0.03) and OS (0.02). If one of the key secondary 
endpoints is statistically significant, the alpha will be transferred to the other endpoint. One interim 
analysis was planned for PFSBM and 2 IA were planned for OS. A Lan-deMets alpha spending function 
with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary was implemented to correct for multiple looks. ORR will be formally 
tested, if the primary and key secondary endpoints are statistically significant.

The two treatment arms will be compared for PFS using a stratified, log-rank test controlling for the 
randomisation stratification factors. The p-value for this test will be calculated using a re-
randomisation-based procedure to reflect the dynamic, hierarchical allocation scheme used for the 
study randomisation.  
For the purpose of describing the treatment effect, the treatment arm hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model 
controlling for the study stratification factors. 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated by treatment arms. In addition to the primary efficacy analysis 
(i.e., re-randomisation model analysis), an analysis of PFS time will also be performed using a 
stratified, log-rank test based on the randomised treatment assignments. 
Table 20: 
Sensitivity Analyses for PFS 
● Non-proportional hazard: In the case that the proportional hazard assumption is violated, a restricted 
mean survival time analysis up to 18 months will be performed to compare the mean survival time of 
the two treatment arms. In addition, the Max-Combo test will be performed to compare the two 
treatment arms.  
● PFS in the ITT-OS Population: PFS per BICR conducted in the ITT-OS population.  
If the primary analysis of PFS is significant, the following analyses may be performed for PFS, using 
the same rerandomisation procedure as for the primary analysis. 
● Missing Assessments of Disease Response: To explore the potential impact of missing assessments of 
disease response on the primary analysis of PFS, two sensitivity analyses will be performed. 
(1) Ignoring the missing assessments, i.e., subjects who missed two or more consecutive scheduled 
assessments before death or PD are considered to have had an event on the date of death or 
progression. 
(2) Imputing the missing assessment, i.e., subjects who missed two or more consecutive scheduled 
assessments before death or PD are considered to have events at the time of the next scheduled 
assessment after the last non-missing assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021

● Stratification: In the case of stratification errors >5% between what is recorded in IRT and eCRF, the 
hazard ratio and its 95% CI will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression 
model controlling for the eCRF stratification factors. 
● New therapy before PD/death: For subjects who received new anti-cancer therapy before PD or 
death, two sensitivity analyses will be conducted. 
(1) Not to consider any anti-cancer therapies (whether systemic, radiation, or surgery) as a censoring 
reason.  
(2) Not to consider radiation therapies as a censoring reason. 
The primary analysis for PFS was using a re-randomisation version of the log-rank test. In addition, a 
standard log-rank test and a stratified Cox model were also calculated. In the analysis, patients 
without post-baseline assessments or who started a new anti-cancer therapy before documented PFS-
event or without documented PFS event were censored. Patients with death or progression right after 
two or more consecutive missed tumour assessments were also censored. The applicant also 
implemented several sensitivity analyses to check the impact of censoring rules and deviation of the 
proportional hazard assumption. 
Key Secondary endpoints 
PFSBM 
This analysis will be performed using the same statistical methods and set of alternative subject 
randomisations used to evaluate the primary endpoint of overall PFS. The hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model 
controlling for the study stratification factors of ECOG and region. 
The sensitivity analyses described for the primary endpoint may be performed, if appropriate. 
As an exploratory analysis, the Kaplan Meier curves and summary for PFS in the non-BM subgroup 
among all randomised subjects will also be presented. 
OS 
This analysis will be performed using the same statistical methods and set of alternative subject 
randomisations used to evaluate the primary endpoint PFS. 
The hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards regression model controlling for the study stratification factors. 
The sensitivity analyses for non-proportional hazard and stratification for the primary endpoint may be 
performed if appropriate. 
Table 21: 
Other Secondary Endpoints 
Other secondary endpoints will be analysed using conventional log-rank statistical methods (re-
randomisation methods will not be used).  
ORR 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 66/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparison of the two treatment arms will be performed using a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test controlling for the study stratification factors. Only response assessments before first 
documented PD or new anti-cancer therapies will be considered. The proportion of subjects with 
objective response will be calculated by treatment arm. ORR determined by BICR will be summarised 
for subjects, who had at least one measurable target lesion at baseline as assessed by BICR among 
ITT-OS set.  
ORR determined by investigator assessment will be summarised for subjects, who had at least one 
measurable target lesion at baseline as assessed by investigator among ITT-OS set. As exploratory 
analyses, the same analyses for ORR will also be conducted using ITT-PFS set. 
PFSINV 
The treatment arm hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be estimated using a stratified Cox 
proportional hazards regression model controlling for the study stratification factors. Comparison of the 
two treatment arms will be performed using a stratified log-rank test controlling for the study 
stratification factors. The nominal p-value from the stratified log-rank test will be provided. Kaplan-
Meier estimates of the median (corresponding 95% confidence intervals) will also be computed for 
each treatment arm. 
Subjects who are alive and have not progressed at the time of the analysis will be censored at the time 
of their last tumour assessment that was a CR, PR, non-CR/non-PD, SD or equivocal progression. 
Details of the censoring scheme for the analysis of PFSINV are the same as the primary endpoint PFS. 
The primary analysis of PFSINV will be performed based on ITT-PFS set. PFSINV will also be summarised 
based on ITT-OS set as an exploratory analysis. 
To explore the potential impact of clinical progression on the analysis of PFS, a sensitivity analysis will 
be performed using the same censoring scheme and methods described for the primary analysis of PFS 
with the exception that subjects who discontinued any study treatment due to clinical progression will 
be counted as ‘progressed’ in the analysis. 
PFSINV will also be summarised based on ITT-PFSBM set as exploratory analyses. 
In addition, the concordance between BICR and investigator assessed PFS event will be summarised. 
CBR 
The proportion of subjects with clinical benefit determined by BICR will be calculated by treatment 
arm. Comparison of the two treatment arms will be performed using a 2-sided CMH test controlling for 
the study stratification factors. The nominal p-value from the stratified CMH test will be reported. 
Similar analysis will be performed for CBR determined by investigator assessment. For investigator 
assessed CBR, the same algorithm for backdating equivocal progression will be applied as in SAP. CBR 
will be summarised for the ITT-OS set. As exploratory analyses, the same analyses for CBR will also be 
conducted using ITT-PFS set. Only response assessments before first documented PD or new anti-
cancer therapies will be considered. The same derivation of PD date and censoring rules as for primary 
PFS analysis will apply for duration of SD or non-CR/non-PD. 
DOR 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median (corresponding 95% confidence intervals) will be computed for 
each treatment arm. The nominal p-value from the stratified log-rank test will be reported. The same 
derivation of PD date and censoring rules as for primary PFS analysis will apply for DOR. Only those 
who achieve a confirmed response among the ITT-OS set will be included in the analysis. 
The analysis of DOR will be repeated based on BICR assessment and investigator assessment. For DOR 
per investigator assessment, the same algorithm for backdating equivocal progression will be applied 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 67/148 
 
 
 
as in SAP. As exploratory analyses, the same analyses for DOR will also be conducted using ITT-PFS 
set. 
A two-sided CMH-test by the same stratification factors used at randomisation was used to analyse the 
proportion endpoints (ORR and CBR). PFS-INV and DOR were analysed using a stratified Cox model 
with the same censoring rules used for PFS. Additional analyses were performed for ORR INV-ORR in 
ITT-OS, INV-ORR in ITT-PFS and BICR-ORR in ITT-PFS set. Sensitivity analyses to assess the potential 
impact of clinical progression were performed for PFSINV. Supplementary analysis for DOR were also 
conducted to assess the robustness of the results (BICR assessment, investigators’ assessment and 
ITT-PFS set). 
Changes in the Planned Analyses 
There were 10 versions of protocol (last version 25 March 2019). The data cut-off date was 04 Sep 
2019. The SAP was finalised 7 Aug 2019.

Conduct of the study 
Major amendments to the protocol were done regarding the removal of an interim analyses of PFS, the 
twice increase in sample size and the change of hierarchical testing of the secondary endpoints. The 
timing of the primary analysis of PFS was also changed. Most changes were done according to advice 
from the FDA. 
Sample size was initially planned to be 180, but increased to 480 in November 2016 (Protocol v.6) 
and, then again, up to 600 in November 18 (Protocol V.8).

Numbers analysed 
A total of 612 patients were randomised 2:1 in the pivotal HER2CLIMB study. Of these, the first 480 
patients were analyses for PFS by BIRC (320 on the tucatinib arm and 160 on the control arm). All 
randomised patients were analysed for OS (410 on the tucatinib arm and 202 on the control arm).  
Moreover, all randomised subjects with target and/or non-target parenchymal brain lesions (per 
RECIST v1.1) at baseline or who have a history of brain metastases, or with brain lesions of equivocal 
significance on screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based on screening data were analysed 
for PFS (PFS BrainMets per BICR; N=291; 198 on the tucatinib arm and 93 on the control arm).

The primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC was statistically significantly improved by 2.2 months in the ITT-
PFS population, i.e. from 5.6 months to 7.8 months (HR 0.544 (95%CI: 0.420; 0.705). Data could be 
considered mature with 55.6% and 60.6% events in the tucatinib versus the placebo-arm, 
respectively. PFS by BICR conducted in the ITT-OS population was in line with the result from the 
primary analysis (HR=0.535 (95%CI: 0.420, 0.682), and PFS by INV supports this, see table 14.2.7.5 
above. 
Many patients were censored for PFS by BIRC in both treatment arms, i.e. 44.4% (n= 142) and 39.4% 
(n=63), respectively (Table 14.2.1.3). Many of these censored patients switched to new anti-cancer 
therapy before PD (n=75 and n=47 in each arm, respectively). The main reason for initiation of new 
anti-cancer therapy was PD per investigator (n=82 of 122 patients i.e. 67%). Another 17 patients 
(14%) had clinical progression of disease, while 7 patients discontinued due to an AE (6%). 6 patients 
had radiographic progression, 5 discontinued due to subject decision, and 2 patients stopped due to 
non-compliance and protocol deviations, respectively. Two pre-specified sensitivity analyses were 
conducted for subjects who received new anti-cancer therapy before PD or death:

Statistically significant after adjustment for multiplicity. The threshold for statistical significance was 0.0080. 
Brain metastases population was defined as a subset of subjects with a history of brain metastases or presence of brain metastases or brain lesions 
of equivocal significance on screening MRI. 
Hazard ratio was computed from the Cox proportional hazards model using stratification factors (ECOG PS: 0/1, and Region of world: North 
America/Rest of World) at randomisation.

Of the 198 patients treated with tucatinib, more than half have had an PFS brain event. These 
patients, who had a history of brain metastases or presence of brain metastases on MRI, had a 
statistically significant improvement of PFS from 5.4 months to 7.6 months 
The intracranial response rates by BICR and investigator are shown below. The assessment of BIRC vs 
INV differs both regarding the number of evaluable patients at baseline (48 vs 55 patients in the 
tucatinib arm) and the fractions of patients with response (35.4% vs 47.3% with tucatinib) and the 
DOR (8.2 months vs 6.8 months with tucatinib).

ORR is now shown for the entire ITT-OS population (n=612). Updated ORR by BIRC with tucatinib was 
34.6% (95%CI: 30.0; 39.5) vs 19.3% (95%CI: 14.1;25.4) in the control arm. 
ORR per investigator on the tucatinib arm was 36.6% (95%CI: 31.9, 41.5) versus 19.3% (95%CI: 
14.1, 25.4) on the control arm (nominal P=0.00002). 
DOR 
Duration of response was analysed in patients with measurable disease at baseline in the ITT-OS. The 
median DOR per BICR on the tucatinib arm was 8.3 months (95%CI: 6.2, 9.7) and 6.3 months 
(95%CI: 5.8, 8.9), on the control arm. The median DOR per investigator was 6.9 months (95%CI: 6.2, 
8.3) on the tucatinib arm and 6.9 months (95%CI: 4.2, 8.9) on the control arm.  
ORR was presented for the ITT-OS population, but only the patients who had measurable disease are 
included.

PRO-data concerning hospitalisations and ER visits show no clinically meaningful differences between 
the treatment arms. Moreover, HRQoL scales measuring anxiety/depression, mobility, pain/discomfort, 
self-care, and usual activities were done in a subset of the ITT population (n=330) and did not show 
any meaningful differences, suggesting that tucatinib treatment do not have a detrimental effect on 
health-related quality of life.

For the primary endpoint, PFS by BIRC, the point estimates are all in favour of tucatinib and only in 
patients of more than 65 years of age, do the 95%CI overlap with 1.  
For the key secondary endpoint OS, all of the point estimates again favour treatment with tucatinib; 
however, the 95%CI’s overlap with 1 in the subgroups who are ≥65 years, HR and/or PR positive, do 
not have brain metastases, and are ECOG PS 1.  
For PFS in the subgroup of patients with brain metastases at baseline, the sample size is smaller than 
with the two previous subgroup analyses (n=291). In spite of this, all of the point estimates are still in 
favour of tucatinib and only a few and small overlaps of 1 occur.

Design 
ONT-380-206 (HER2CLIMB)  
HER2CLIMB is an ongoing, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active comparator, global 
study of tucatinib or placebo in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in subjects with 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who have had prior treatment with 
trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1 (ado-trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab emtansine). 
Subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive tucatinib or placebo in combination with 
trastuzumab and capecitabine. Randomisation was performed using a dynamic hierarchical 
randomisation scheme and was stratified by presence or history of treated or untreated brain 
metastases (yes, no), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (0, 1), and 
region of world (US, Canada, Rest of World).  Six hundred twelve subjects were randomised.

Results and Analysis  
Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis of PFS per BICR was conducted using the data cut-off date of 
04 September 2019, at which time 275 PFS events (disease progression or death) had occurred in 
the ITT-PFS population (N = 480). The pre-specified interim analyses for the key secondary 
endpoints OS and PFSBrainMets per BICR were conducted as a result of the statistically significant PFS 
analysis. Both key secondary endpoints were statistically significant; therefore, OS and PFSBrainMets 
analyses are considered final and no more formal statistical testing will be conducted. Additionally, 
the alpha-controlled secondary endpoint of confirmed ORR by BICR was formally tested between two 
treatment arms and was also found to be statistically significant in favour of the tucatinib arm.

Age 
In the HER2CLIMB study, clinical benefit was achieved both among subjects <65 years and those ≥ 65 
years in the tucatinib arm (PFS per BICR HR= 0.54 and 0.59, respectively; OS HR=0.69 and 0.58, 
respectively).  
Supportive studies 
ONT-380-005 (Phase 1b Study)  
Study Design 
Study ONT-380-005 evaluated tucatinib in combination with capecitabine alone (Combination 1), 
trastuzumab alone (Combination 2), and with both trastuzumab and capecitabine (Combination 3; 
tucatinib triplet combination), in subjects with progressive HER2+ MBC who have received prior 
treatments with both trastuzumab and T-DM1 for metastatic disease. The primary objective of the 
study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
tucatinib to be given in combination with capecitabine alone, with trastuzumab alone, and with both 
trastuzumab and capecitabine. The study used a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating dose levels of 
tucatinib to determine the MTD/RP2D for each combination. Three pre-defined dose cohorts were 
planned for Combinations 1 and 2, and cohort advancement was based on safety data. If <2 subjects 
experienced dose-limiting toxicity, in both these combinations then tucatinib would be evaluated for 
Combination 3. Secondary efficacy objectives included the evaluation of tucatinib and capecitabine

pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-tumour activity (both systemically and in the brain). The study 
completed enrolment in December 2015. The DCO date for the primary analysis was 06-Mar-2018. 
An additional expansion cohort of subjects with central nervous system (CNS) metastases that were 
either untreated or progressing after prior radiation therapy was also enrolled. 
The doses of trastuzumab and capecitabine in the study were as follows: 
• 
• 
trastuzumab 8 mg/kg IV loading dose Day 1 Cycle 1, followed by 6 mg/kg IV Day 1 of all 
subsequent cycles. 
capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 PO BID for 14 days of every 21-day cycle; 
Following initiation of study treatment, CT/MRI scans of all areas of known disease were to be obtained 
at the end of every 2 treatment cycles through Cycle 6, and then at the end of every 3 treatment 
cycles, until PD, initiation of a new therapy, or withdrawal of consent. 
Study Population 
A total of 60 subjects were enrolled and treated at 5 study sites in the US. The safety analysis set 
included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (tucatinib, capecitabine, or 
trastuzumab). Efficacy was analysed in 2 populations of subjects: 
•  Efficacy analysis set - all subjects from the safety analysis set who had at least 1 identifiable 
(target and/or nontarget) lesion at baseline and (1) had at least 1 post-baseline disease 
assessment or (2) if they had no post-baseline disease assessment, discontinued study 
treatment due to death, clinical or radiologic PD, or an AE.  
•  Measurable disease set - all subjects from the safety analysis set who had at least 1 
measurable target lesion at baseline and (1) had at least 1 post-baseline disease assessment 
or (2) if they had no post-baseline disease assessment, discontinued study treatment due to 
death, clinical or radiologic PD, or an AE. 
Statistical Analysis 
This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and MTD/RP2D of tucatinib given in 
combination with trastuzumab and/or capecitabine. No formal statistical comparisons between dose 
cohorts were performed. 
Subject Disposition 
Twenty-seven of the 60 subjects enrolled were assigned to the tucatinib triplet combination cohort of 
300 mg PO BID tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine. The majority of subjects in the tucatinib 
triplet combination cohort discontinued from the study due to disease progression (19 [70%] 
subjects), 1 subject (4%) discontinued due to AEs, and 2 subjects (7%) died. 
Demographics  
All the subjects in the tucatinib triplet combination cohort were female and the median age was 50 
years (range, 35 to 67 years). The majority of subjects were white and not Hispanic or Latino. 
Seventeen subjects (63%) had ECOG PS of 0 and 10 subjects (37%) had an ECOG PS of 1. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The median time from first positive biopsy for breast cancer to first study treatment was 40.4 months 
(range, 11.6 to 162.1 months) in the tucatinib triplet combination cohort (Table 45). Eleven subjects 
(41%) had past or current brain metastases at baseline. The median number of prior lines of systemic 
therapy was 5 (range, 2 to 9).

ONT-380-005 Efficacy Conclusions 
The ONT-380-005 study provided the initial evidence of the clinical activity of tucatinib in combination 
with trastuzumab and capecitabine in HER2+ MBC and supported the initiation of the HER2CLIMB 
study: 
• 
The ORR in this study for subjects with measurable disease was 60.9% (95%CI: 38.5, 80.3)

o  The ORR in subjects with a baseline history of brain metastases was 55.6% (95%CI: 
21.2, 86.3) and 64.3% (95%CI: 35.1, 87.2) in subjects with no baseline history of 
brain metastases 
• 
• 
The median DOR for subjects with measurable disease treated with the tucatinib triplet 
combination was 11.1 months (95%CI: 2.9, 18.7). In subjects with a baseline history of brain 
metastases DOR was 14.9 months (95%CI: 4.9, 21.4) and in subjects without a baseline 
history of brain metastases DOR was 8.9 months (95%CI: 2.8, 19.4) 
The median PFS per investigator of the subjects treated with the tucatinib triplet combination 
was 7.8 months (95%CI: 4.1, 12.5) 
 Supporting Study: ONT-380-004 (Phase 1b) 
ONT-380-004 is an ongoing phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation study in subjects with HER2+ MBC 
designed to identify the MTD or RP2D of tucatinib in combination with the approved dose of T-DM1 
(3.6 mg/kg every 21 days) and to assess the safety and tolerability of the combination. Other 
objectives included evaluation of tucatinib and T-DM1 PK, anti-tumour activity, and exploration of 
potential biomarkers.  
A total of 57 subjects were enrolled and treated at 11 centres in the US and Canada. In the initial 
protocol, the starting dose level was 300 mg PO BID using the tablet formulation, 50% of the MTD for 
the tucatinib powder-in-capsule (PIC) formulation; the protocol was later amended to include the doses 
of 300, 350, and 400 mg BID. The MTD was determined to be 300 mg BID, which achieved a similar 
drug exposure as the MTD of the PIC formulation, 600 mg BID. An additional CNS expansion cohort 
was enrolled and treated at the MTD for subjects with metastases not requiring immediate local 
treatment which were either untreated or had progressed after prior radiation therapy/surgery. 
Fifty subjects were treated at 300 mg BID dose level, including 8 subjects treated in the initial dose-
escalation cohort of 300 mg BID, 23 in the MTD expansion cohort, and 19 in the CNS expansion 
cohort. The median age of subjects enrolled in the 300 mg cohorts was 51 years (range, 30 to 72). All 
subjects were female, and most were white (74%). Most subjects in the 300 mg cohorts had past or 
current brain metastases (60%) and nearly all (98%) had distant metastases. As of the DCO date of 
31-Jan-2018 for the primary analysis, most subjects had discontinued from the study, the majority of 
which discontinued due to PD. Six subjects in the 300 mg cohort enrolled in the long-term extension 
phase of the study. 
For the 34 subjects in the measurable disease analysis set treated with tucatinib 300 mg BID + T-DM1, 
CR was observed in 1 subject (2.9%) and PR in 15 subjects (44.1%). The ORR was 47.1% (95%CI: 
29.8, 64.9) with a DOR of 7.0 months (95%CI: 2.8, 19.6). In the 30 subjects with a baseline history of 
brain metastases treated with tucatinib 300 mg BID + T-DM1, 21 (70%) subjects had measurable 
disease with an ORR of 47.6% (95%CI: 25.7, 70.2) and a median DOR of 7.0 months (95%CI: 1.5, 
NE). In the 20 subjects with no baseline history of brain metastases treated with tucatinib 300 mg BID 
+ T-DM1, 13 subjects (65%) had measurable disease with an ORR of 46.2% (95%CI: 19.2, 74.9) and 
a median DOR of 19.6 months (95%CI: 2.8, NE).

BID + T DM1 treatment was 8.2 months (95%CI: 4.8, 10.3). The median PFS for the 29 subjects with 
a baseline history of brain metastases was 6.7 months (95%CI: 4.8, 10.2), and 8.2 months (95% CI: 
3.1, 21.2) for the 19 subjects without a baseline history of brain metastases.

ARRAY-380-101 is a completed first-in-human, open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study of tucatinib 
monotherapy in subjects with advanced HER2+ solid tumours. This study was designed to identify the 
MTD and to assess the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of tucatinib using a PIC formulation. 
A total of 50 subjects (43 subjects with MBC, 6 subjects with colorectal cancer, and 1 subject with 
salivary gland cancer) were enrolled onto the study. All subjects had received at least 1 prior systemic 
anticancer regimen, with an overall median of 5 (range, 1 to 15) prior regimens.  
In the dose-escalation phase of the study, 33 subjects were enrolled and received tucatinib at doses 
ranging from 25 to 800 mg PO administered BID. The dose of 600 mg BID was determined to be the 
MTD and an additional 17 subjects with MBC were enrolled and treated at the MTD in the dose 
expansion phase of the study. 
Of the 35 efficacy-evaluable subjects with MBC, 5 subjects (14%) achieved a PR, with a median DOR 
of 12.3 weeks (95%CI: 4.1, 28).  
In this study, tucatinib showed single-agent activity with a favourable safety profile in heavily 
pretreated subjects. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy assessment of the new active substance tucatinib is primarily based on the pivotal 
HER2CLIMB study, which is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 2 study 
conducted in 169 centres over a 3-year period and the study population was predominantly 
comparable to the European patient population. A total of 612 patients were randomised 2:1 to the 
tucatinib arm (n=410) and the control arm (n=202).  
Major amendments to the protocol were done regarding removal of an interim analyses of PFS, a twice 
increase in sample size, and change of the hierarchical testing of the secondary endpoints. The timing 
of the primary analysis of PFS was also changed. However, the applicant has sufficiently justified this. 
The design of the pivotal HER2CLIMB study is endorsed. Importantly, all patients were screened with 
MRI of the brain at baseline, allowing monitoring of a treatment effect despite metastases to the brain. 
The patients were randomised 2:1 between a backbone of capecitabine and trastuzumab plus tucatinib 
or placebo, which is endorsed, as the chosen backbone therapies are considered a recommendable 
treatment option in the absence of a SOC in the proposed setting.  
The inclusion criteria are endorsed. Especially, it is supported that patients should have had received 
previous treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, which is standard of care both in the 
(neo-) adjuvant and the metastatic setting of HER2+ breast cancer. The inclusion of patients with 
stable brain metastases are highly endorsed as metastases to the brain is a common clinical problem 
resulting in high morbidity and mortality in the targeted HER2+ MBC patient population. The patients 
had to fulfil strict CNS in- and exclusion criteria and for example patients with ongoing use of systemic 
corticosteroids for control of symptoms of brain metastases at total dose of >2 mg dexamethasone (or 
equivalent) were excluded, and the in-and exclusion criteria regarding patients with brain metastases 
are reflected in the SmPC. 
The exclusion criteria are also acceptable. Any previous anti-HER2 targeting TKI’s such as lapatinib and 
neratinib were not allowed, which is acceptable as tucatinib is in the same category of drugs and the 
efficacy of tucatinib is better assessed and confirmed in a TKI-naïve study population.

The pivotal study included patients from 169 study centres over a period of ~3 years and 
predominantly from populations that are similar to the European populations. This is an acceptable 
recruitment time and the study population is overall considered comparable to the European patient 
population. Trastuzumab was standardly dosed and administered either as iv or sc formulation, which 
is acceptable. Although trastuzumab is generally favoured over lapatinib, practicing oncologists 
confronted with such a choice considers whether the patient has brain metastases and the treatment-
free interval. Lapatinib, given the low molecular weight, is more efficiently crossing the blood-brain 
compared to trastuzumab. In the absence of brain metastases, trastuzumab is usually re-challenged 
given a treatment-free period over six months or, even, a year. With this in mind, an uncertainty 
remains that at least in a subset of the patient population included in the HER2CLIMB trial a lapatinib-
based treatment could have been considered as a better treatment option, but since this is not 
interfering with isolation of the treatment effect/benefit of Tukysa in the intended patient population, it 
is not a blocking issue preventing a positive benefit risk conclusion for the product. 
The dosing of capecitabine was lower than what is normally recommended for metastatic breast 
cancer, but since the approved dose of capecitabine for combination with lapatinib was used, this is 
acceptable. The recommended dose of tucatinib is 300 mg orally twice daily, which seems acceptable 
from an efficacy point of view. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms. It 
is noted that ~45% had brain metastases at baseline and that the patients had a median of 4 previous 
lines of therapy, most of these in the metastatic setting. This is reflective of or maybe even a more 
pre-treated study population, than what is required for the targeted patient population encompassed 
by the applied indication. In spite of 62.7% of the cases were diagnosed at stage III or below, only 
33% had received neoadjuvant or adjuvant trastuzumab, and this is hard to understand, because it 
has been a standard treatment for many years. All patients were incurable at study entry and, as 
reflected by the applied indication and the inclusion criteria, they should all have received treatment 
with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and TDM1. In the setting of a clinical trial and testing a new drug 
substance such as tucatinib, it is acceptable that the included patients were more heavily pre-treated 
than the targeted patient population, as long as they have received available standard of care, which is 
the case here. There are no imbalances in the baseline- and disease characteristics that are considered 
to have had a major impact on the study results. 
The primary objective is to assess PFS by blinded review (BIRC). Key secondary objectives are to 
assess OS and PFS in patients with brain metastases at baseline. Other secondary objectives are to 
assess PFS, ORR and DOR by investigator as well as the clinical benefit rate (CBR) by blinded review 
and investigator. Lastly, health-related quality of life, safety and tolerability of tucatinib and 
pharmacokinetics were evaluated. The primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC is acceptable in the pivotal 
study, as this was placebo-controlled and randomised in a treatment setting, where prolonged PFS is 
clinically meaningful and relevant as the primary efficacy endpoint. In this metastatic setting, where 
many patients have severe disease manifestations such as brain metastases, having OS as key 
secondary endpoint is clinically relevant and endorsed. PFS in patients with brain metastases at 
baseline is also considered an important key secondary endpoint, as it is known that the brain may 
often be the first site of progression in patients with the targeted HER2-positive breast cancer disease. 
The other secondary endpoints, such as response rate (ORR) and the durability of the responses 
(DOR), are also considered clinically relevant endpoints. Moreover, the clinical benefit rate (CBR), 
which is often used in the setting of metastatic breast cancer because it includes a clinically relevant 
stabilisation of the targeted disease, is also endorsed as a clinically meaningful secondary endpoint. 
The blinding procedures described to keep the study masked throughout conduct are generally 
considered adequate. The use of an independent DMC to assess unblinded data and all endpoints 
determined by BICR using RECIST 1.1 is endorsed.

The strategy used to keep the overall type I error at 5% is accepted. It is noted that the testing 
strategy was modified several times during the course of the trial. According to the applicant, the 
changes were not data driven (see also below). 
The use of a re-randomisation test as the primary analysis is endorsed, since this test reflects the 
randomisation strategy. This test can only provide a p-value and therefore the difference in PFS 
between the treatment arms is difficult to interpret from a clinical point of view. This drawback was 
mentioned in the Scientific Advice given by the CHMP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/367605/2017). The use of a 
Cox model to contextualise the results is accepted given the difficulties to find an estimate with clinical 
interpretation using a randomisation test. The censoring rules are not agreed. While administrative 
censoring is not expected to introduce bias, censoring of patients with missing assessment before 
progression, lost to follow-up or who switched to other therapies before DP is not considered adequate. 
Those patients could have a different PFS risk than the patients remaining in the study. However, the 
applicant presented several sensitivity analyses using the Cox model, where the censoring rules were 
changed to assess the impact of the censoring rules. This is endorsed. There were 27.8 % (N= 88) and 
33.7 % (N=54) of the patients, who were censored due to the above-mentioned reasons in the 
tucatinib and placebo arms, respectively (Table 14.2.1.3).  It is of concern that around one third of the 
patients left the study before experiencing a PFS event and therefore it is reassuring that the results of 
the sensitivity analyses are concordant with those presented in the primary analysis.  
Both PFSBM and OS were analysed in a similar fashion as PFS, using a randomisation version of the log-
rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by the randomisation factors to 
contextualise the results. This is agreed.   
Since no censoring rules were specified for PFSBM, it is understood that the same rules implemented for 
PFS applied here. For OS, patients who did not die at the time of the analysis or are lost to follow-up, 
were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. As mentioned above, the censoring rules 
for PFSBM are not agreed either. The applicant performed the same sensitivity analysis as for PFS to 
PFSBM, which had concordant results with the primary analysis. According to the protocol, patients will 
be followed up for survival except in case of withdrawal of consent or study closure. The number of 
patients with missing survival status is low (18 and 5 patients in the Tuc+Cap+Tra and Pbo+Cap+Tra 
arms, respectively) and this is not expected to impact the presented results. 
The statistical methods used for the analyses of the secondary endpoints are overall agreed. The 
applicant has provided the requested supplementary analysis for ORR using the OS ITT population 
(n=612): 1) using the total number of patients in the denominator; 2) including only those patients 
with measurable disease at baseline. It is noted that the ORR remain clinically significantly improved in 
the tucatinib arm. The tables of ORR by BIRC and INV are shown in the results section.  
Small changes regarding descriptive statistics and secondary/exploratory endpoints were done after 
the finalisation of the SAP. These changes are considered minor and will not affect the primary results. 
Twenty-five percent screen failures are acceptable. Most of the randomised patients were treated in 
the respective treatment arms and it is noted that there were an acceptable number of patient 
withdrawals and only 1 patient lost to follow-up. 
The exclusion of randomised patients from the ITT-PFS dataset is not agreed, since it is not in line with 
the intention to treat principle. A supplementary analysis of PFS was conducted in the ITT-OS 
population and the result was similar to that presented for the primary analysis. Therefore, this issue is 
not further pursued. The definition of the analysis sets for OS and PFSBM is agreed. 
The applicant has justified the two protocol changes that led to increasing the sample size, first from 
180 to 480 and lastly to 600 patients. A retrospective analysis of the initial 442 subjects (out of the 
planned 480) that were already enrolled in the trial by the time version 8 of the protocol was 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 100/148 
 
 
 
implemented, has been provided that overall shows consistency with the final analysis. These results 
provide some reassurance though other supplemental analyses (e.g. on the data before and after the 
implementation of this second sample size amendment) could have proven more informative, i.e. to 
confirm that the results were not driven by the latter group. The rationales presented are however 
considered sufficiently convincing and since the applicant states that data integrity was maintained 
throughout the process, the changes made can be considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC was statistically significantly improved by 2.2 months in the ITT-
PFS population (n=480), i.e. from 5.6 months to 7.8 months (HR 0.544 (95%CI: 0.420; 0.705)). Data 
could be considered mature with 55.6% and 60.6% events on the tucatinib versus the placebo-arm, 
respectively. PFS by BICR conducted in the ITT-OS population was in line with the result from the 
primary analysis (HR=0.535 (95%CI: 0.420, 0.682), and PFS by INV also supports this. The KM curves 
separate early and keep being significantly separated in the observation time available. Median follow-
up time for PFS is ~10 months, and the applicant will provide the final results by the end of Q2 2023, 
which is acceptable (see also Efficacy conclusion).  The observed difference in PFS of 2.2 months is 
considered clinically relevant for this heavily pre-treated patient population, considering that ~45% of 
the patients have a poor prognosis due to brain metastases at baseline. 
It is agreed that the sensitivity analyses are in line with the primary analysis of PFS by BIRC. The 
applicant has provided requested additional information/analyses to those available in the original 
submission. For the primary analysis FDA censoring rules were used. Separate sensitivity analyses 
considering the four categories of censoring reasons as events have been provided and the results 
were consistent with the primary analysis. The key secondary endpoint was OS and partly mature data 
show a statistically significantly improved OS in the ITT population from 17.4 months to 21.9 months 
with tucatinib, HR 0.662 (95%CI: 0.501; 0.875). The KM curves separate after 7 months and the 
difference between the curves seem to increase with time in favor of the tucatinib arm. The median OS 
of ~17 months for the placebo arm with 42.1% events show the dismal prognosis for this patient 
population and the observed OS difference of 4.5 months is considered clinically relevant in this 
setting. Median follow-up time for OS is ~14 months and the applicant will also provide the final results 
by the end of Q2 2023, which is acceptable (see also Efficacy conclusion).  
Of the 198 patients with brain metastases at baseline who were treated with tucatinib, more than half 
have had an PFS brain event, so the PFS BM data are quite mature. These patients had a statistically 
significant improvement of PFS from 5.4 months to 7.6 months, which is in line with PFS benefit shown 
for the ITT-PFS population. The difference of 2.2 months, HR 0.483 (95%CI: 0.339; 0.689) is clinically 
relevant and the KM curves clearly separate after 3 months of treatment and, as observed for PFS by 
BIRC, the difference seem to increase with time. These data are considered fairly robust, since MRI 
was done at baseline, and the sample size is adequate for an assessment. The applicant has provided 
data from 48 patients with measurable brain metastases and the ORR was 35.4% with a median 
duration of response of 8.2 months, which is clinically relevant for this patient population. Hence, 
clinically relevant efficacy is also observed with tucatinib in patients with evidence of brain metastases 
at baseline.   
Brain metastases frequently have a clinical impact at a much smaller size than body metastases due to 
their location within the skull. While target lesions per RECIST v1.1 are limited to those measuring at 
least 1 cm, lesions can be clinically meaningful at smaller sizes when located in critical areas of the brain. 
In addition, subjects frequently have multiple small lesions that represent meaningful disease burden, 
but individually do not meet the criteria to be deemed measurable disease, and cannot be assessed for 
partial response. This limits the number of subjects with brain metastases assessable for brain-specific 
activity in the context of a combined body and brain reading paradigm. In addition, brain lesions often 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 101/148 
 
 
 
represent a relatively smaller proportion of the overall “Sum of Diameters” compared to visceral lesions 
which are often larger. This relative size differential may result in a clinical situation where a brain lesion 
has progressed and requires intervention with radiation, but the overall increase in the size of body plus 
brain lesions has not met the +20% threshold for radiographic progressive disease per RECIST v1.1. If 
radiation  is  given  to  a  target  lesion  in  this  clinical  setting,  the  subject  would  no  longer  be  considered 
evaluable for response and would be censored from efficacy analyses, to avoid confounding the response 
analysis  with  radiation  treatment.  Importantly,  subjects  with  brain  metastases  have  a  more  complex 
history of prior radiation to the brain than those without brain metastases. Subjects can undergo several 
courses  of  brain  radiotherapy  during  the  course  of  their  disease,  which  can  include  focal  radiation 
treatment  to  different  lesions  at  different  times  performed  at  different  facilities  and/or  whole  brain 
radiotherapy. Unlike body radiation which is more typically given to areas which would be considered 
non-target  lesions  (e.g.  bone,  chest  wall),  brain  lesions  may  be  target  lesions,  but  must  be  either 
untreated or progressing after prior radiation/surgery to be evaluable as a target. This requires detailed 
collection and documentation of baseline data and careful selection to ensure target lesions are correctly 
selected and evaluated.  
The CHMP considering these caveats, concluded that the ORR by BIRC is considered the most clinically 
relevant measure although both the ORR by BIRC and Investigator are presented; hence, the ORR by 
BIRC of 35.4% (95%CI: 22.2; 50.5) in 48 patients with measurable brain metastases, who had a 
median duration of response of 8.2 months (95%CI: 4.1; 9.7) is the numbers and results assessed 
and considered relevant to display in the SmPC. This ORR and DOR are considered clinically relevant in 
this patient population, where approximately half of the patients have brain metastases at targeted 
treatment setting. ORR was presented for the ITT-OS population, but only the patients who had 
measurable disease were included. Therefore, a supplementary analysis for ORR using the entire ITT-
OS population (n=612) is provided and results are in line with the primary analysis. Taking this into 
account, the presented data for patients with measurable disease do show an increased response rate 
in the tucatinib arm from 22.8% to 40.6% of the patients, which is considered clinically relevant, while 
the updated ORR by BIRC in the entire population for the tucatinib arm was 34.6% (95%CI: 
30.0;39.5). It is acknowledged that some patients with metastatic breast cancer have bone-only 
disease, which per definition is unmeasurable. Moreover, brain metastases are not always measurable 
by RECIST criteria, so if the brain is the only site of possible measurable disease, this can also be 
challenging. However, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) is designed to compensate for this by including 
cases of stable disease for more than 6 months, better reflecting the overall benefit in treated patients, 
including those with unmeasurable disease. 
The CBR results show a clinically and statistically significant improvement of CBR by BIRC with 
tucatinib from 38.1% to 59.8% of the patients. A response or a stabilisation for ≥6 months of 
metastatic, incurable breast cancer in two thirds of the study population, who are heavily pre-treated, 
is considered a highly clinically relevant improvement. The CBR was analysed in the entire ITT-OS 
population.  As mentioned, the clinical benefit rate (CBR) is considered a clinically relevant endpoint for 
patients with metastatic breast cancer, who might have unmeasurable disease e.g. due to bone-only 
disease or unmeasurable brain metastases. The CBR results show a clinically and statistically 
improvement of CBR by BIRC with tucatinib from 38.1% to 59.8% of the patients, which is similar to 
the CBR by INV. A response or a stabilisation for ≥6 months of metastatic, incurable breast cancer in 
two thirds of a study population, who are heavily pre-treated, is considered a highly clinically relevant 
improvement. 
Although the patients in HER2CLIMB were heavily pre-treated, with a median of 4 prior treatment 
regimens, 73% of the patients had one or more subsequent treatment regimens and 60.6% of the 
patients had anti-HER2-targeted treatment regimens. Many continued trastuzumab-based treatments 
and almost 20% received a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, most frequently lapatinib (14.8%) or neratinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 102/148 
 
 
 
(4.7%). Only 5.6% received an antibody-conjugate, most frequently experimental agents as they 
should have received TDM1 before entering the pivotal study. In the HR positive subgroup 10.1% 
received a new anti-hormonal treatment or CDK4/6-inhibitors, while very few (2.8%) were treated 
with immunotherapy (anti-PD1/PDL1). Overall, the subsequent treatments may affect the overall 
survival rate; however, as tucatinib shows efficacy despite metastases to the brain, which is often the 
site of progression for patients with HER2-positive MBC, the improvement of OS should still be 
sustainable. 
PRO-data concerning hospitalisations and ER visits show no clinically meaningful differences between 
the treatment arms. Moreover, HRQoL scales measuring anxiety/depression, mobility, pain/discomfort, 
self-care, and usual activities were done in a subset of the ITT population (n=330) and did not show 
any meaningful differences, suggesting that tucatinib treatment do not have a detrimental effect on 
health-related quality of life. Data on the HRQoL has been removed from the SmPC, since there are no 
formal type I error control. 
Subgroup analyses of efficacy of tucatinib regarding PFS, OS, and PFS in patients with brain 
metastases at baseline are consistent across all subgroups, with no clinically meaningful differences 
observed.  
2.4.9.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal HER2CLIMB study show clinically relevant efficacy of the addition of 
tucatinib to the backbone therapies of capecitabine and trastuzumab regarding PFS, OS and PFS in 
patients with brain metastases at baseline. 
However, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address limitations related to 
efficacy: submission of final PFS and OS data in order to further investigate the efficacy of tucatinib in 
combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 2 prior anti HER2 treatment 
regimens (Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study in accordance with the European Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) No 357/2015 indent a; See Annex II). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall, subjects have been exposed to tucatinib in 4 studies in subjects with cancer, including the 
pivotal trial HER2CLIMB (ONT-380-206) and 8 studies in subjects without cancer (see table 48). 
The applicant presented an integrated analysis with the following safety analysis populations was 
conducted:  
- HER2CLIMB safety analysis population: All randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment (tucatinib 300 mg oral dose [PO] twice daily [BID] or placebo plus capecitabine and 
trastuzumab), with subjects allocated to the treatment group associated with the regimen received 
(N=601; 404 on the tucatinib arm and 197 on the control arm). In the tucatinib arm, 3 subjects did 
not receive at least one dose of capecitabine, and one subject did not receive at least one dose of 
trastuzumab.   
The applicant has provided further updated safety data with a DCO of 29 May 2020, resulting in 
additional 9 months of follow-up. As of the new DCO, 118 of the 404 patients (29.2%) on the tucatinib 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 103/148 
 
 
 
arm had received at least 12 months of tucatinib treatment and the median exposure to tucatinib was 
7.4 months (range, <0.1 to 43.6), with 54 patients (13.4%) still receiving tucatinib treatment. 
- Pooled safety analysis population 1 (Pool 1): Subjects who received tucatinib ≥300 mg PO BID tablet 
in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab on Studies HER2CLIMB and ONT-380-005 (N=431) 
- Pooled safety analysis population 2 (Pool 2): Subjects who received tucatinib ≥300 mg PO BID tablet 
in combination with capecitabine alone, trastuzumab alone, or capecitabine and trastuzumab in Studies 
HER2CLIMB and ONT-380-005 (N=464) 
- Monotherapy analysis population: Subjects who received tucatinib ≥600 mg PO BID powder-in-
capsule (PIC) on Study ARRAY-380-101 (N=31) 
The tucatinib integrated safety population included all subjects who received tucatinib doses at or 
above the MTD/RP2D (600 mg PO BID PIC or 300 mg PO BID tablet).

Rash 
The overall incidence of rash was higher on the tucatinib arm (21.8% vs. 14.7%), but ≥ grade 3 
events were rare (<1%).  
The majority of events were resolved and the median time to onset was 42 vs 27 days on the tucatinib 
arm compared to the control arm, while the median time to resolution was 24 vs 12 days. Rash rarely 
resulted in tucatinib discontinuation. 
The incidence of rash was higher in the tucatinib monotherapy study compared to the tucatinib arm of 
HER2CLIMB (29.0% vs. 21.8%). 
Cardiac Toxicity 
The incidence of QT prolongation was similar in the tucatinib and placebo control treatment arms of the 
HER2CLIMB study (4.7% vs 4.6%) and the incidence of grade ≥3 events was also similar (1.7 vs 
1.0%). This is consistent with pool 1 and QT prolongation occurred in <5% across all safety 
populations. Dose modifications and discontinuations due to this event were rare; however, 1 patient 
in the tucatinib arm discontinued treatment due to cardiac arrest. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 118/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 60: 
The incidence of decreased LVEF was also similar between the treatment arms of HER2CLIMB (Table 
10.3.10 in ISS with data cut off 29May 2020) and most patients (~82.5%) had no clinically meaningful 
change from baseline (Table 10.3.13 in ISS with data cut off 29May 2020). A maximum decrease of 
20% or more from baseline was rarely observed (1.1% vs 0.6%). Among patients with a worst post-
baseline ejection fraction below 50%, the decrease was 10% or more in 2.2% of patients on the 
tucatinib arm and 4.1% of patients on the control arm. In patients with a 10% or higher decrease in 
ejection fraction from baseline, the median time to their worst post-baseline value was 5.7 vs 2.7 
months on the tucatinib vs the control-arm.   
Cerebral oedema 
Overall, 4 cases of cerebral oedema were observed in the HER2CLIMB study  
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 119/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Updated safety data informed of one case of grade 2 cerebral oedema in the tucatinib arm. The grade 
2 event was observed 52-year-old woman for 9 days and according to the listing above, no change of 
dose for any of the study drugs were deemed necessary and resolved/recovered.  
Table 61: Cerebral oedema cases (May 29, 2020 data cut-off) 
Creatinine increase 
Increases in serum creatinine, mostly grade 1, were observed in 13.9% of subjects on the tucatinib 
arm of HER2CLIMB. There were no grade ≥3 events, and acute kidney injury and renal failure TEAEs 
were infrequent with similar incidence between treatment arms. A mean increase in creatinine levels of 
approximately 30% was observed within the first cycle of tucatinib treatment; levels remained 
elevated but stable and returned to baseline upon treatment discontinuation. Most post-baseline values 
were within the upper limit of normal. BUN values remained stable throughout tucatinib treatment.

Treatment-related AEs  
Table 62: 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 121/148 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 63: 
There were more treatment-related events in the tucatinib arm of the HER2CLIMB study (85.4% vs 
73.1%). Treatment-related Grade ≥3 events were observed in 45.5% vs 30.5% with tucatinib vs 
placebo. More patients discontinued tucatinib due to ADRs in the tucatinib arm (4.2% vs 2.5%). 
Hence, the addition of tucatinib increases the overall treatment-related toxicity, but the level of ADRs 
is acceptable as this rarely leads to discontinuations. 
Adverse drug reactions based on HER2CLIMB safety data 
Determination of ADRs was based on HER2CLIMB safety data. A broad review of all grade AEs in the 
HER2CLIMB study was conducted, using different incidence cut-offs. This review informed the initial 
selection criteria for the determination of ADRs as follows:  
- an incidence of ≥10% in the tucatinib arm regardless of causality, and  
- ≥5% higher incidence in the tucatinib arm compared to the control arm. 
As a subsequent step, each AE term selected using the above criteria was further evaluated for 
possible causal association. The AE terms identified using the absolute incidence rate cut-off and the 
relative frequency between the treatment arms in HER2CLIMB are listed below. A pooled analysis of 
subjects treated with tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in the HER2CLIMB 
and ONT-380-005 studies is also presented below. 
The frequency categories of ADRs included in the SmPC were determined from the pooled analysis of 
results from subjects treated with tucatinib + trastuzumab + capecitabine in the HER2CLIMB and ONT-
380-005 studies (n=431).

Table 64: Initial adverse reaction terms based on absolute incidence and relative frequency 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 123/148 
 
 
 
 
These AE terms were further evaluated for possible causal association with tucatinib using the following 
criteria: analysis of AEs and relevant laboratory values from HER2CLIMB, with adjustment for time at 
risk; analysis of AEs and relevant laboratory values in ONT-380-005 (tucatinib ± trastuzumab ± 
capecitabine) and ARRAY-380-101 (tucatinib monotherapy); the mechanism of action of tucatinib; 
medical judgement. 
Based on this review, anaemia, decreased appetite, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and PPE syndrome 
were determined not to be causally associated with tucatinib, although each occurred with a higher 
crude incidence rate in the tucatinib arm of the HER2CLIMB study.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAEs 
Table 65: 
Approximately 29% of the patients in both arms had an SAE in the HER2CLIMB study and the most 
commonly observed SAEs in the tucatinib vs placebo arm were diarrhoea (4.2% vs 3.6%), vomiting 
(2.7 vs 2.5%), and nausea (2.2% vs 1.5%).

Deaths 
Table 66: 
Overall, 8 patients died from treatment-emergent events in the tucatinib arm (2%) vs 6 patients (3%) 
in the placebo arm. Detailed narratives have been provided and are assessed as follows: 
One patient died of cardiac failure, while receiving tucatinib and trastuzumab, but had discontinued 
capecitabine due to PPE. Since MUGA scans had been normal throughout her study participation and 
the initial respiratory failure was caused by grade 3 pleural effusion and cardiac failure, it is likely that 
the underlying cause of death was disease progression.  
One patient died due to sepsis and it was considered related to capecitabine. Especially since the dose 
of capecitabine used was 1500 mg/m2/day, which is higher than the dose recommended in the SmPC 
for capecitabine in combination with tucatinib i.e. 1000 mg/m2/day. 
One patient died due to multiple organ dysfunction, which was induced by severe diarrhoea that is 
assessed most likely due to the capecitabine treatment. The patient continued a full dose of tucatinib 
together with capecitabine up until 6 days before her death and it cannot be ruled out that tucatinib 
could have worsened/and or contributed to the severe diarrhoea due to the temporal plausibility. One 
patient died due to dehydration, primarily due to severe diarrhoea and this was considered possibly 
related to tucatinib (and capecitabine). These two subjects, both on the tucatinib arm, who reported 
Grade 4 events of diarrhoea. One of the 2 subjects died from dehydration, the other from multiple 
organ dysfunction syndrome. In both subjects, diarrhoea was ongoing at the time of death. Both 
events were concurrent with a suspected infection. The median time to onset of the first event of

diarrhoea was 12 days on the tucatinib arm; 80.9% of events resolved, with a median time to 
resolution of 8 days. On the control arm, the median time to onset of the first event of diarrhoea was 
22 days; 84.1% of events resolved, with a median time to resolution of 6 days.  
One patient died due to cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and sepsis, which was not considered 
related to tucatinib. 
One patient died due to septic shock, diarrhoea, hypernatremia, Clostridium difficile colitis, white blood 
cell count decreased, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, which was deemed not related to tucatinib 
but to capecitabine treatment.  
One patient died of sudden death, which was considered due to an unknown cause and not related to 
tucatinib.

In the placebo arm, further six narratives are presented, of which 1 death was deemed related to the 
blinded study drug, which was placebo + capecitabine + trastuzumab. Updated safety data did not 
change these results. 
Laboratory findings 
Table 67: 
Approximately half of the patients in HER2CLIMB had grade 1-2 low haemoglobin (53.5% vs 46.7%). 
Grade ≥3 events were rarely observed (3% vs 1%). Low leucocytes were observed of low grade in 
19.6% vs 15.2%, while low grade low neutrophils were observed in 55.7% vs 54.3%. Low platelets 
were observed of low grade in 27.5% vs 22.3%, but seldomly observed of ≥ grade 3 events. Increased 
liver enzymes and bilirubin plus grade ≥3 ALT and AST increase were more frequently observed with 
tucatinib.

A total of 5 male subjects were enrolled and randomised in the HER2CLIMB study, including 3 subjects 
on the tucatinib arm and 2 subjects on the control arm. There were no new safety signals identified in 
male subjects treated with tucatinib in HER2CLIMB. No other male subjects were included in the 
tucatinib integrated safety population. 
Hepatic and Renal Insufficiency 
In Study ONT-380-009, a single 300 mg dose of tucatinib was well tolerated in subjects with mild, 
moderate, or severe hepatic function. In subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, 
increases in tucatinib exposure were <2-fold compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, and 
did not meaningfully impact tucatinib exposure. Renal elimination is a minor contributor to tucatinib 
elimination (4% of radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine in Study ONT-380-008). Renal impairment 
is predicted to have low impact on tucatinib PK. 
Extrinsic Factors 
No subgroup analyses were performed by extrinsic factors.

Slightly more patients discontinued tucatinib/placebo on the tucatinib arm (5.7% vs 3.6%). The most 
common AEs leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea and increased ALT (1% vs 0.5%) followed by 
AST increased, bilirubin increased and vomiting (0.7% vs 0-0.5%). 
A similar fraction of patients discontinued capecitabine on both treatment arms (10.9% vs 9.6%) and 
the most common AEs leading to discontinuation were PPE (2.7% vs 2%) and diarrhoea (1.7% vs 1%) 
followed by ALT increased (1% vs 0%), dehydration (0.7% vs. 0), and AST increased (0.5% vs. 0). 
More patients discontinued trastuzumab on the tucatinib arm (4.2% vs 3.0%) in HER2CLIMB. The most 
common AEs leading to trastuzumab discontinuation included: ALT increased (0.7% vs. 0), diarrhoea 
(0.7% vs. 0.5%), AST increased (0.5% vs. 0), bilirubin increased (0.5% vs. 0.5%), respiratory failure 
(0.5% vs. 0), and sepsis (0.5% vs. 0.5%).

More patients in the tucatinib arm resumed capecitabine at the same dose, while a similar fraction 
(~33%) resumed at reduced dose. Hence, the dosing of the backbone chemotherapy of capecitabine 
seem not to be compromised by AEs from the addition of tucatinib. 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the tucatinib arm was 11.9% vs 10.2% in the placebo 
arm, and this is an acceptable rate considering the treatment setting and the heavily pre-treated study 
population. As both capecitabine and tucatinib treatment often leads diarrhoea and other GI 
symptoms, it is difficult to disentangle the precise cause of these events. However, it is clear that most 
toxicity from the study treatment combination stems from tucatinib or capecitabine, but the 
discontinuation rates are still within an acceptable level with further updated safety data.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population consists in patients who received the study treatment combination of tucatinib, 
capecitabine, and trastuzumab. It comprises 404 patients from the pivotal HER2CLIMB study, and is 
the main focus for this assessment, as the study is randomised, placebo-controlled and the doses of 
both capecitabine and tucatinibcorrespond to the ones applied for. Other safety data from pool 1 and 2 
(n=431 and n=464, respectively), and the phase 1 data on monotherapy from 31 patients are 
considered supportive. The size of the safety data available on patients, who have received the study 
treatment combination is considered acceptable.  
The median duration of exposure to tucatinib or placebo for the safety population (n=601) was 7.4 
months (range:<0.1-43.6) (data cut-off 29-May-2020). As of the new DCO, 118 of the 404 patients 
(29.2%) on the tucatinib arm had received at least 12 months of tucatinib treatment and with 54 
patients (13.4%) still ongoing on tucatinib treatment, the median exposure is now acceptable and in 
line with the median PFS on the tucatinib arm (7.8 months).  
Most recent updated safety data show that almost all of the patients experienced at least one AE in 
HER2CLIMB, and ~59.2% experienced a ≥grade 3 AE. A quarter of the patients had an SAE (29.2%); 
however, only 2% of the patients had an SAE leading to death. The overall discontinuation rate due to 
AEs was 11.9%, and 5.7% discontinued tucatinib (SmPC section 4.8).  
In the HER2CLIMB study, the most frequently reported all-causality clinical AEs were (tucatinib vs 
placebo-arm): diarrhoea (81.9% vs 53.8%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia i.e. PPE (64.9% vs 
53.3%), nausea (59.7% vs 44.7%), fatigue (47.5% vs 44.2%), vomiting (36.9% vs 25.9%), 
decreased appetite (25.7% vs 20.8%), stomatitis (26.0% vs 14.2%), and headache (23.3% vs 
20.3%). It is noted that these AEs are commonly observed with capecitabine treatment, which is part 
of the study treatment combination. However, the clinical AEs of diarrhoea, PPE, nausea, vomiting, and 
stomatitis were less frequently observed in the placebo arm, so tucatinib is considered accountable for 
these increased incidences.  
Updated grade 3 AEs were reported in (tucatinib vs placebo-arm): 59.2% vs 51.3% of the patients and 
the most common clinical ≥ grade 3 events were PPE (13.9% vs 9.1%), diarrhoea (13.1% vs 8.6%), 
and fatigue (5.4% vs 4.1%), and it is noted that the both the increment and the incidences are 
diminished, which is reassuring. Especially, it is noted that the overall high rate of diarrhoea in the 
tucatinib arm (81.9%) was only a grade ≥3 event in 13.1%, although it is evident that tucatinib is 
contributing to this high overall rate of diarrhoea. Moreover, the similar rates in both treatment arms 
of other clinical AEs such as fatigue and headache, and grade ≥3 AEs, such as nausea and vomiting, 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 134/148 
 
 
 
are most likely due the toxicity of capecitabine. Headache may also be a symptom associated with a 
history of brain metastases, which was present at baseline in ~48% of the patients.  
Overall, updated safety data with relevant exposure showed a minor increase of AEs and grade 3 AEs, 
mostly in both treatment arms, which is acceptable and to be expected with longer exposure. 
Adverse events of special interest include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, PPE, rash, 
cardiac toxicity, cerebral oedema, and increased creatinine.  
Diarrhoea was very commonly observed and the incidence was increased when tucatinib was added to 
capecitabine and trastuzumab. In HER2CLIMB, diarrhoea occurred sooner (tucatinib vs placebo-arm) 
with median time to onset 12 vs 22 days, and the event lasted longer i.e. 8 vs 6 days. Grade ≥3 AEs 
of diarrhoea occurred in 13.1% on the tucatinib arm and 8.6% on the control arm. Even though high-
grade events were within an acceptable level and patients who had to permanently discontinue 
tucatinib/placebo was low (0.5-1%), SAEs were observed in ~4% of the patients and 2 patients died 
from dehydration and multiple organ dysfunction, respectively, due to ongoing diarrhoea. Similar 
incidences of diarrhoea were observed in the supporting studies. 
If diarrhoea occurs, antidiarrhoeals should be administered as clinically indicated. For Grade ≥3 
diarrhoea, treatment with tucatinib should be interrupted, then dose reduced or permanently 
discontinued (SmPC section 4.4). Diagnostic tests should be performed as clinically indicated to 
exclude infectious causes of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea or diarrhoea of any grade with complicating 
features (dehydration, fever, neutropenia). Diarrhoea is an identified risk which will be managed by 
routine risk minimisation. This risk will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance 
activities and discussed as a safety concern in PSURs. 
Nausea was frequently observed in both treatment arms; however, clearly more frequent in the 
tucatinib arm (59.7% vs 44.7%). The median time to onset was a bit shorter (9 vs 12.5 days) and the 
mean time to resolution was longer (47.2 vs 36.6 days) in patients on the tucatinib arm.  
Vomiting was also frequently observed in both arms, again more frequent with tucatinib (36.9% vs 
25.9%). The time to onset was also shorter (21 vs 33 days) and the mean time to resolution longer 
15.8 vs 11.1 days in the active arm. Both AEs are also known with capecitabine. The overall risk of 
nausea and vomiting is currently acceptable and the predominantly low grade and manageable 
incidence of these events do not require additional prophylactic measures beyond the dose 
modification guidance proposed in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.     
Stomatitis was also more frequently observed on the tucatinib arm (26.0% vs 14.2%), which is 
expected, as tucatinib is a TKI that targets HER2. The level of stomatitis observed in HER2CLIMB 
indicates that the maximum tolerated dose of both capecitabine and tucatinib was probably used.  
In HER2CLIMB, increased hepatotoxicity was observed with tucatinib (44.3% vs 25.9%) and this was 
especially observed for elevated AST, ALT, and bilirubin. More grade ≥3 events of hepatotoxicity were 
observed with tucatinib than with placebo (10.4% and 5.1%), however the time to resolution was 
similar (22.0 vs 23.5 days; median 50.6 vs 50.2).  
There was one case that met the laboratory criteria (ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP) of Hy’s law, and this 
patient recovered following dose modification of both tucatinib and capecitabine. The patient continued 
treatment for 12 cycles until PD. In a further analysis for any potential drug-induced liver injury, all 
patients, except the one mentioned with combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin, had 
confounding possible alternative aetiologies for these abnormalities. 
Overall, increased hepatotoxicity with earlier onset and longer time to resolution was observed with the 
study treatment combination. However, this was within an acceptable level and could generally be 
handled with dose-modifications of tucatinib and/or capecitabine. ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 135/148 
 
 
 
monitored every three weeks or as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, 
interrupt dose, then dose reduce or permanently discontinue treatment with tucatinib (SmPC section 
4.4). 
Hepatotoxicity is an identified risk of tucatinib which will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance 
through signal detection, adverse reaction reporting, and discussion in PSURs. Beyond adverse 
reactions reporting and signal detection, a follow-up Hepatic Event Questionnaire is included as a 
routine pharmacovigilance activity. This is considered acceptable. Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities and/or risk minimisation measures are not warranted. 
As the hepatic safety profile in subjects with chronic liver conditions is unknown, the safety in subjects 
who are known carriers of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, or who have auto-immune hepatitis, 
sclerotizing cholangitis, or other known chronic liver disease has been included as a safety concern in 
the RMP under missing information. 
An increased incidence of PPE was observed with tucatinib (64.9% vs 53.3%) and the median time to 
onset was similar in both arms. More grade ≥3 events were observed with tucatinib (13.9% and 
9.1%). However, it is acknowledged that the exposure of capecitabine was longer in the tucatinib arm 
and this may have affected the incidences of PPE, which is a known adverse event with capecitabine. 
For this reason, PPE is not considered an ADR or important potential risk for tucatinib. 
The incidence of rash was higher in the tucatinib monotherapy study compared to the tucatinib arm of 
HER2CLIMB (29.0% vs. 21.8%). However, the sample size was small in the monotherapy study 
(N=31). The TEAEs were primarily Grade 1, with Grade ≥3 events reported in less than 1% of subjects. 
Overall, rash is a known AE of TKI’s such as tucatinib and is considered to be induced by tucatinib. 
Nevertheless, the event is considered manageable and it is agreed that rash should not be listed as a 
safety concern. 
Cardiac toxicity was expected with tucatinib as it is a HER2- targeted therapy, and this is a class effect 
with other anti-HER2 therapies. Overall, the incidences of AEs of QT prolongation and decreased LVEF 
on treatment with tucatinib does not seem to be clinically meaningfully increased. 
Although cardiotoxicity was not seen specifically for tucatinib, HER2-directed therapies have the 
potential to cause cardiotoxicity, especially in the elderly when combined with anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy regimens. Cardiotoxicity with tucatinib is not considered a potential risk but there is a 
possibility that this could be seen in subjects with other significantly cardiotoxic chemotherapy agents; 
therefore, the safety profile in this patient population may be different. The safety in patients with prior 
cumulative anthracycline doses equivalent to >360 mg/m2 doxorubicin has been included in the list of 
safety concerns under missing information. The Standard AE Reporting Form was updated to inquire if 
patients received prior cumulative anthracycline doses equivalent to > 360 mg/m2 doxorubicin when 
cardiac events are reported which will allow closer monitoring of cardiotoxicity in patients who have 
received prior anthracycline doses equivalent to >360 mg/m2 in the post-marketing setting. The two 
ongoing studies (Study SGNTUC-016 (HER2CLIMB-02), and Study SGNTUC-017 (MOUNTAINEER)) 
were included as additional pharmacovigilance activities to further characterise this risk. 
Overall, 4 cases of cerebral oedema were observed in the HER2CLIMB study including 1 case observed 
with capecitabine and tucatinib treatment. In one of the cases, the cerebral oedema observed was 
most likely due to the underlying disease (brain metastases), prior surgery, and the discontinuation of 
steroids.  
Updated safety data informed of one case of grade 2 cerebral oedema in the tucatinib arm. Since the 
patient had multiple brain metastases at study entry, had known epilepsy, and the event of cerebral 
oedema was of low grade and resolved after 9 days, it was not considered to be evidence of a potential 
risk with tucatinib but assessed as related to the underlying disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 136/148 
 
 
 
There were more treatment-related adverse events in the tucatinib arm vs placebo arm of the 
HER2CLIMB study (85.4% vs 73.1%). Treatment-related Grade ≥3 events were observed in 45.5% vs 
30.5% with tucatinib vs placebo arm.  
Approximately 29% of the patients in both arms had a serious adverse event (SAE) in the HER2CLIMB 
study and the most common were diarrhoea (4.2% vs 3.6%), vomiting (2.7% vs 2.5%), and nausea 
(2.2% vs 1.5%). It is noted that more patient in the placebo arm had dyspnoea, pleural effusion, and 
headaches, which may be signs of clinical progression. Overall, the rate of SAEs with tucatinib is 
acceptable considering the treatment setting and targeted patient population. 
In the pivotal study, 8 patients died from treatment-emergent adverse events in the tucatinib arm 
(2%) vs 6 patients (3%) in the placebo arm. After review of the detailed narratives it is agreed with 
the applicant that two of 8 cases of AEs leading to death can be considered related to tucatinib 
treatment. In one case the patient died due to multiple organ dysfunction, which was induced by 
severe diarrhoea that was assessed most likely due to the capecitabine treatment (reported above). 
The patient continued a full dose of tucatinib together with capecitabine up until 6 days before her 
death and it cannot be ruled out that tucatinib could have worsened/and or contributed to the severe 
diarrhoea due to the temporal plausibility. In another case, the patient died due to dehydration 
primarily due to severe diarrhoea and this was considered possibly related to tucatinib (and 
capecitabine; reported above). Relevant monitoring is put in place to miminise the risk of diarrhoea. In 
the placebo arm, 1 death was deemed related to the blinded study drug, which was 
placebo+capecitabine+trastuzumab.  
With regards to laboratory abnormalities, haematological toxicity was overall assessed as most likely 
due to capecitabine and there is no clear pattern at this time showing that tucatinib contributes very 
much, if anything, to this type of toxicity. Low grade liver toxicity was also observed but remains to an 
acceptable level.  
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in the tucatinib arm was 11.9% vs 10.2% in the placebo 
arm, and this is an acceptable rate, considering the heavily pre-treated study population. As both 
capecitabine and tucatinib treatment often leads diarrhoea and other GI toxicity, it is difficult to 
disentangle which of the drugs that is the main contributor to these events. However, it is noted that 
slightly more patients discontinued tucatinib/placebo on the tucatinib arm (5.7% vs 3.6%), while a 
similar fraction of patients discontinued capecitabine on both treatment arms (10.9% vs 9.6). 
More patients discontinued tucatinib due to ADRs in the tucatinib arm (4.2% vs 2.5%), while a similar 
proportion of patients in both arms discontinued either capecitabine or trastuzumab due to ADRs. 
Hence, the addition of tucatinib increases the overall treatment-related toxicity. Nevertheless, the level 
of ADRs is so far acceptable as this rarely leads to discontinuations.  
Adverse events according to age were presented. In the HER2CLIMB study, 82 patients who received 
tucatinib were ≥65 years, of whom 8 patients were ≥75 years. For the tucatinib arm, there were 
slightly more toxicity in patients aged ≥65 years old, most commonly pertaining to diarrhoea, fatigue, 
nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, AST/ALT increased, and anaemia. In the placebo arm, the 
small number of patients ≥65 years, (n=33) makes these patterns hard to interpret. Dose adjustment 
due to age beforehand is not warranted.  
There were no patients ≥85 years enrolled on the study. There were too few patients ≥75 years to 
assess differences in safety. Therefore, the SmPC reflects tucatinib has not been investigated in 
patients above the age of 80 years. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 36.5% in patients 
≥ 65 years compared to 24.8% in patients < 65 years. It is noted that there were significantly more 
fatal events (14.8% vs 5%) and cardiac disorders (10.8% vs 5%) in the population of ≥65-74 years of 
age. The group of ≥75-84 is too small (n=8) for any conclusions.

Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, tucatinib may cause harmful 
effects to the foetus when administered to a pregnant woman (see also discussion on non-clinical 
aspects and SmPC section 4.6).   
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
is a contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Since the numbers of patients exposed to tucatinib longer than 12 months is considered very limited 
(n=118, 29.2% received at least 12 months of tucatinib treatment as of 29 May 2020), long-term 
safety is considered a safety concern included as missing information in the RMP. To further 
characterise the safety of tucatinib in the long term, two ongoing studies (Study SGNTUC-016 
(HER2CLIMB-02), and Study SGNTUC-017 (MOUNTAINEER)) have been included as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP. 
HER2CLIMB-02  (SGNTUC-016)  is  an  ongoing  randomised,  double-blind  pivotal  trial  in  subjects  with 
metastatic breast cancer. Approximately 230 subjects will be treated with tucatinib in combination with 
T-DM1. MOUNTAINEER (SGNTUC-017) study is an ongoing single-arm, open-label pivotal trial in subjects 
with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer.  This  study  consists  of  3  cohorts  and  will  enrol  approximately  110 
subjects.  Subjects  enrolled  in  Cohort  A  or  Cohort  B  will  be  treated  with  tucatinib  and  trastuzumab 
combination therapy, and subjects enrolled in Cohort C will be treated with tucatinib monotherapy. Data 
from these cohorts will support further characterisation of tucatinib’s long-term safety profile.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of tucatinib is as could be expected with a HER2-targeting TKI. The updated safety 
data with relevant median exposure did not lead to any major clinically relevant differences of AEs, 
SAEs and discontinuations and therefore the safety profile of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine 
and trastuzumab is considered overall acceptable and clinically manageable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for tucatinib is combination therapy with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the 
treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, 
including patients with brain metastases at baseline, who have received at least 2 prior anti-HER2 
treatment regimens. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the targeted patient population, who have received at least 2 prior anti-HER2 treatment regimens, 
there are no standard of care. Available therapy would typically consist of chemotherapy in 
monotherapy in combination with trastuzumab, but no single regimen is approved for the applied 
treatment setting after treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and TDM-1. Moreover, limited 
efficacy of these used regimens is observed, with reported median PFS of 3.3 to 4.9 months (Krop 
2014; Rugo 2019) and a median OS of 15.8 to 17.2 months (Krop 2017; Rugo 2019).  
Hence, there is a high unmet medical need for further targeted therapy, and there is also a high unmet 
medical need for a therapy that are active in the CNS for patients with brain metastases, as there is no 
systemic treatment approved for this indication, and brain metastases are a major clinical problem in 
this patient population. The prognosis of HER2+ advanced breast cancer patients, progressed to 
several HER2-directed agents and with brain metastasis, remains dismal. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study HER2CLIMB is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase 2 
study conducted in 169 centres over a 3-year period and the study population was predominantly 
comparable to the European patient population. A total of 612 patients were randomised 2:1 to the 
tucatinib arm (n=410) and the control arm (n=202). Moreover, 198 patients with brain metastases at 
baseline were treated with tucatinib. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC was statistically significantly improved by 2.2 months in the ITT-
PFS population (n=480), i.e. from 5.6 months to 7.8 months (HR 0.544 (95%CI: 0.420; 0.705). There 
were 55.6% and 60.6% events on the tucatinib versus the placebo-arm, respectively. The KM curves 
separate early and keep being separated in the observation time available. Median follow-up time for 
PFS is ~10 months. PFS by BICR conducted in the ITT-OS population support the result from the 
primary analysis (HR=0.535; 95%CI: 0.420, 0.682). 
The key secondary endpoint of OS showed a statistically significant improvement in the ITT population 
from 17.4 months to 21.9 months with tucatinib, HR 0.662 (95%CI: 0.501; 0.875). The KM curves 
separate after 7 months and the difference between the curves seem to increase with time in favor of 
the tucatinib arm. There were 31.7% and 42.1% events on the tucatinib vs the placebo arm. Median 
follow-up time for OS is currently ~14 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021  
Page 143/148 
 
 
 
PFS in patients with brain metastases at baseline was statistically significant improved from 5.4 
months in the control arm to 7.6 months with tucatinib, which is a difference of 2.2 months, HR 0.483 
(95%CI: 0.339; 0.689). The KM curves clearly separate after 3 months of treatment.  
ORR in the brain by BIRC in 48 patients with brain metastases at baseline was 35.4% (95%CI: 22.2; 
50.5), and the median duration of response was 8.2 months (95%CI: 4.1; 9.7). 
ORR by BIRC is now presented for the entire ITT-OS population (n=612) and there was an increased 
response rate in the tucatinib arm from 19.3% to 34.6% of the patients with measurable disease. The 
clinical benefit rate (CBR by BIRC) is including patients who had a response or a stabilisation for ≥6 
months and this was also statistically significant improved with tucatinib from 38.1% to 59.8% of the 
patients. 
Subgroup analyses of efficacy of tucatinib regarding PFS, OS, and PFS in patients with brain 
metastases at baseline are consistent across all subgroups, with no clinically meaningful differences 
observed. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The key secondary endpoint OS was partly mature; the data show a statistically significantly improved 
OS at a median follow-up time of approximately 14 months. The applicant will provide the final study 
results post-authorisation by the end of Q2 2023, which is acceptable (see PI and RMP).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
All of the patients experienced at least one AE, and most of these were assessed to be treatment-
related. The most commonly observed AEs were (tucatinib vs placebo-arm): diarrhoea (81.9% vs 
53.8%), PPE (64.9% vs 53.3%), nausea (59.7% vs 44.7%), fatigue (47.5% vs 44.2%), vomiting 
(36.9% vs 25.9%), decreased appetite (25.7% vs 20.8%), stomatitis (26% vs 14.2%), and headache 
(23.3% vs 20.3%). 
Grade 3 AEs were reported in (tucatinib vs placebo-arm): 59.2% vs 51.3% of the patients and the 
most common were PPE (13.9% vs 9.1%), diarrhoea (13.1% vs 8.6%), and fatigue (5.4% vs 4.1%). 
Adverse events of special interest include diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, PPE, rash, 
cardiac toxicity, cerebral oedema, and increased creatinine. Worth mentioning is the increased risk of 
diarrhoea (81.9% vs 53.3%) and hepatotoxicity (44.3% vs 25.9%), especially reported as elevated 
AST, ALT, and bilirubin.  
In the pivotal HER2CLIMB study, 8 patients died from treatment-emergent adverse events in the 
tucatinib arm (2%) vs 6 patients (3%) in the placebo arm. Overall, 2 deaths were possibly related to 
tucatinib/capecitabine treatment. 
Approximately 29% of patients in both arms had a serious adverse event (SAE), most commonly 
diarrhoea (4.2% vs 3.6%), vomiting (2.7% vs 2.5% and nausea (2.2% vs 1.5%).  
The discontinuation rate of any study treatment due to AEs was 11.9% on the tucatinib arm vs 10.2% 
on the placebo arm. More patients discontinued tucatinib/placebo on the tucatinib arm (5.7% vs 
3.6%), while a similar fraction of patients discontinued capecitabine on both treatment arms (10.9% 
vs 9.6%).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are no major uncertainties or limitations about unfavourable effects.  
Since the numbers of patients exposed to tucatinib longer than 12 months is considered very limited 
(n=83, 20.5%), long-term safety is considered a safety concern included as missing information in the 
RMP. To further characterise the safety of tucatinib in the long term, two ongoing studies (Study 
SGNTUC-016 (HER2CLIMB-02), and Study SGNTUC-017 (MOUNTAINEER)) have been included as 
additional pharmacovigilance activities in the RMP. 
HER2CLIMB-02  (SGNTUC-016)  is  an  ongoing  randomised,  double-blind  pivotal  trial  in  subjects  with 
metastatic breast cancer. Approximately 230 subjects will be treated with tucatinib in combination with 
T-DM1. MOUNTAINEER (SGNTUC-017) study is an ongoing single-arm, open-label pivotal trial in subjects 
with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer.  This  study  consists  of  3  cohorts  and  will  enrol  approximately  110 
subjects.  Subjects  enrolled  in  Cohort  A  or  Cohort  B  will  be  treated  with  tucatinib  and  trastuzumab 
combination therapy, and subjects enrolled in Cohort C will be treated with tucatinib monotherapy. Data 
from these cohorts will support further characterisation of tucatinib’s long-term safety profile.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in the proposed treatment 
setting after prior exposure to trastuzumab, pertuzumab and TDM-1 is considered clinically meaningful, 
since the primary endpoint of PFS by BIRC was met and showed a 2.2 months improvement. Moreover, 
the key secondary endpoint of OS shows clinically meaningful improvement of 4.5 months despite only 
partly mature data with ~30% events on the tucatinib arm. PFS in patients with brain metastases at 
baseline was also improved by 2.2 months, so efficacy is considered shown with tucatinib despite 
metastases to the brain. In addition, efficacy of tucatinib regarding PFS, OS, and PFS in patients with 
brain metastases at baseline are consistent across all subgroups, with no clinically meaningful 
differences observed.  
Since PFS by BIRC is mature and OS partly mature with no sign of a detrimental effect, it is acceptable 
that the final PFS and OS data will be provided as a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES).  
The reported adverse events with tucatinib seem to be manageable and mostly pertaining to 
gastrointestinal toxicity from tucatinib and/or capecitabine. The safety profile did not change 
significantly with updated safety data and relevant median exposure, therefore the safety of tucatinib 
in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine is considered acceptable.  
To contextualise, tucatinib is indicated in a setting where there is no standard of care available and 
currently used treatment regimens show limited efficacy. Moreover, there are currently no approved 
therapies indicated for HER2+ breast cancer patients with brain metastases. Hence, there is a high 
unmet medical need for further treatment options for the targeted patient population in the proposed 
setting. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab is favourable. However, the 
key secondary endpoint OS was partly mature with data showing a statistically significantly improved 
OS at a median follow-up time of approximately 14 months. Therefore, the submission of the final OS 
and PFS results from study HER2CLIMB as a PAES, in accordance with the European Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 indent a), has been imposed by the CHMP (see Annexes and 
RMP). 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The submission of final OS and PFS results from study HER2CLIMB  to further investigate the efficacy 
of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with 
HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least 2 prior anti-
HER2 treatment regimens has been imposed by the CHMP (in accordance with the European 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 indent a). 
Assessment report  
EMA/78409/2021

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of tucatinib in combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

2.   Scientific discussion 
2.1.   Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study R1093310987-COV-2121 A Phase 2a, Open-Label Study Assessing 
Pharmacokinetics, Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Single-Dose Subcutaneous Anti-Spike 
(S) SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibodies (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) in High-Risk Paediatric Subjects 
Under 12 Years of Age is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.   Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Casirivimab and imdevimab drug products are supplied as 120 mg/mL solutions for intravenous (IV) 
and subcutaneous (SC) administrations. The drug products are preservative-free and nonpyrogenic. 
For IV administration, casirivimab and imdevimab must be administered together, after dilution, as a 
single IV infusion. For SC administration, casirivimab and imdevimab must be administered 
consecutively by SC injection. 
There is no specific paediatric formulation of casirivimab+imdevimab. 
2.3.   Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
R1093310987-COV-2121 A Phase 2a, Open-Label Study Assessing Pharmacokinetics, Safety, 
• 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of Single-Dose Subcutaneous Anti-Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal 
Antibodies (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) in High-Risk Paediatric Subjects Under 12 Years of Age. 
The study was initiated in the United States (US) on 13 September 2021 (first patient first visit) when 
the dominant circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2 was Delta. On 23 December 2021, participant 
enrolment was paused due to the rapidly increasing prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529/BA.1 
Omicron variant, against which casirivimab+imdevimab showed diminished in vitro neutralization 
potency. The participants who had been enrolled prior to the pause date were followed according to the 
protocol. Enrolment was not restarted, and the study was officially terminated on 28 June 2022. As a 
result of the early termination, only 7 participants were enrolled in the study. 
2.3.2.  
Clinical study 
Methods 
Study participants 
Enrolled in this study were participants <12 years old who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 but 
were at high risk to develop severe COVID-19 if they became infected. 
Key inclusion criteria 
  Was <12 years of age and ≥3 kg to <40 kg at the time parental/guardian consent was signed 
  Had at least 1 risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 if they became infected

Treatments 
Participants received a single dose of casirivimab+imdevimab, that was the body weight dose 
equivalent to the 1200 mg adult dose (600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab) administered 
as 1 to 4 SC injections based on body weight.

Objective(s) / Outcomes / endpoints 
Table 2: Objectives and endpoints 
Participants were followed-up for PK and safety tests until Day 169. 
Sample size 
The study planned to enrol at least 24 participants (12 in Group A and 12 in Group B). However, due to the early 
termination, the study only enrolled 7 participants across 3 centres in the US. All 7 participants were enrolled into 
Group A (≥10 kg to <40 kg); no participants were enrolled into Group B (≥3 kg to <10 kg). Participants in Group A (≥10 
kg to <40 kg) were subsequently divided into two groups for analysis: Group A (≥20 kg to <40 kg), which included 2 
participants, and Group A2 (≥10 kg to <20 kg), which included 5 participants.

Results 
Participant flow 
Table 3: Participant Disposition, All Enrolled Participants. 
Baseline data 
All participants in the study were > 1 years old (range 1 to 11 years). The majority were female (5 
participants [71.4%]) and White (6 participants [85.7%]). 
Number analysed 
All participants received study treatment and were included in the safety analysis set One (14.3%) 
participant discontinued the study early (at Week 9) due to being lost to follow-up. 
Safety results 
Five participants experienced 12 TEAEs, all non-serious (grade 1-2).

Table 4: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Primary System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term, SAF.  
One event each of Pneumonia viral, Gastroenteritis, Cough and Cough variant asthma were grade 2; 
all other events were grade 1. 
None of the participants experienced grade ≥3 TEAEs, AESIs, treatment-related TEAEs, or SAEs. None 
of the participants either discontinued the study due to a TEAE, died during the study, or experienced 
any hypersensitivity reactions or any injection site reactions. 
No clinically meaningful findings in clinical laboratory values or vital signs measurements were 
reported. 
Pharmacokinetics results 
The concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab following a single SC dose of casirivimab+imdevimab 
based on body weight tier are linear and characterized by an initial absorption phase followed by a 
linear terminal elimination phase. 
Maximum concentrations of casirivimab and imdevimab were achieved approximately 3 to 7 days 
following SC administration, although 1 participant in the ≥10 kg to <20 kg body weight tier exhibited 
peak concentration at 28 days post-dose. Concentrations remained quantifiable for all participants 
through the last sampling time point which ranged from 11 to 175 days post-dose. The mean 
concentration-time profiles of casirivimab and imdevimab are similar between the ≥10 kg to <20 kg 
tier and the ≥20 kg to <40 kg tier). This suggests that tiered weight-based dosing achieves similar 
exposures across the body weight range of ≥10 kg to <40 kg. 
Immunogenicity results 
None of the 7 participants in this study developed anti-drug antibodies to casirivimab or imdevimab. 
2.3.3.  
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The scope of this study was evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
of a single-dose subcutaneous Casirivimab and Imdevimab in high-risk paediatric subjects under 12 
years of age.  
Enrolment was paused after 4 months due to the rapidly increasing prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 
B.1.1.529/BA.1 Omicron variant, against which casirivimab+imdevimab showed diminished in vitro

neutralisation potency. The participants who had been enrolled prior to the pause date were followed 
according to the protocol. Enrolment was not restarted. As a result of the early termination, only 7 
participants were enrolled in the study.  
Eligible were participants <12 years old and with a weight of ≥3 kg to <40 kg who were not infected 
with SARS-CoV-2 but were at high risk to develop severe COVID-19 if they became infected. 
The study planned to enrol at least 24 participants (12 participants ≥10 kg to <40 kg (Group A) and 
12 participants ≥3 kg to <10 kg (Group B). However due to the early termination of the study only 7 
participants were enrolled, all participants were > 1 years old (range 1 to 11 years). 
The concentrations of total casirivimab and imdevimab following a single SC dose of 
casirivimab+imdevimab based on body weight tier are linear and characterised by an initial absorption 
phase followed by a linear terminal elimination phase. Maximum concentrations of total casirivimab 
and total imdevimab were typically achieved approximately 3 to 7 days following SC administration. 
The mean concentration-time profiles of casirivimab and imdevimab are similar between the ≥10 kg to 
<20 kg tier and the ≥20 kg to <40 kg tier). This suggests that tiered weight-based dosing achieves 
similar exposures across the body weight range of ≥10 kg to <40 kg. Following single 1200 mg dose 
SC administration, the casirivimab and imdevimab serum concentrations reported in this study are 
higher than in the adult population from study R10933-10987-COV-2069. No data in participants < 1 
year of age are available.  
Efficacy of casirivimab+imdevimab in the paediatric population has to be determined in the paediatric 
population, however that is currently hampered by epidemiological situation i.e. diminished efficacy in 
the currently circulating variants. In addition, collected confirmatory PK data to support an envisaged 
bridging approach are not deemed conclusive.  
No changes to the product information are proposed. 
3.   CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, the MAH submitted a completed 
paediatric study for Ronapreve. The scope of this study was evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of a single-dose subcutaneous Casirivimab and Imdevimab in high-
risk paediatric subjects under 12 years of age. Seven (7) participants were enrolled, all participants 
were > 1 year old (range 1 to 11 years). Following single 1200 mg dose subcutaneous administration, 
the casirivimab and imdevimab serum concentrations reported in this study were higher than in the 
adult population from study R10933-10987-COV-2069. None of the 7 participants in this study 
developed anti-drug antibodies to casirivimab or imdevimab. The safety profile reported was 
acceptable. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events were mild or moderate. Efficacy of casirivimab and 
imdevimab in the paediatric population under 12 years of age still has to be determined, however that 
is currently hampered by the epidemiological situation. At this point in time no changes to the product 
information are proposed.

Figure 1. Ulcerative colitis clinical trial programme 
Study M14-234 Substudy 3 was a Phase 3 maintenance study with a primary objective to  
evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg once daily (QD) compared  
with placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who achieved clinical response per 
Adapted Mayo score following induction therapy from the Phase 2 induction Study M14-234 Substudy 1 
and the two identical Phase 3 induction Studies M14-234 Substudy 2, and Study M14-675. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Study M14-234 enrolled adult subjects 18 to 75 years of age with moderately to severely active UC 
defined as an Adapted Mayo score of 5 to 9 (consisting of stool frequency subscore [SFS], rectal 
bleeding subscore [RBS], and endoscopy subscore) with endoscopy subscore of 2 or 3 (confirmed by a 
central reader).  
In addition to adult subjects, adolescent subjects 16 and 17 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg 
who met the definition of Tanner Stage 5 were also eligible if allowed by local regulations/institutional 
review boards/independent ethics committees. 
Treatments 
For the treatments given in the study, please see figure below.

Figure 2. M14-234 Substudy 3 design 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Substudy 3 (Phase 3 maintenance) was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
upadacitinib 30 mg and 15 mg compared to placebo in achieving clinical remission per Adapted Mayo 
score in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who achieved clinical response per Adapted 
Mayo score following induction therapy from Study M14-234 Substudy 1, Substudy 2, or Study M14-
675.  
The secondary objective of Substudy 3 was to evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg 
compared to placebo in the multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints at Week 52 including 
endoscopic improvement, maintaining clinical remission, corticosteroid-free remission, maintaining 
endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission, maintaining clinical response, mucosal healing, no 
bowel urgency, no abdominal pain, histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, change in 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) total score, and Functional Assessment of Chronic 
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
This final clinical study report summarizes the safety of upadacitinib as maintenance therapy in  
Study M14-234 Substudy 3 (Phase 3 maintenance).  The only and final analysis for the 52-week 
efficacy data of Study M14-234 Substudy 3 was performed at a database lock and unblinded analysis 
conducted in June 2021 for the purpose of regulatory submission has been previously submitted as 
part of variation X/12.

Sample size 
Study M14-234  Substudy 3 was planned for approximately 750 subjects who achieved clinical 
response per Adapted Mayo Score after completion of induction treatment or Extended Treatment 
Period in Study M14-234 Substudy 1, Substudy 2, or Study M14-675 were eligible to enter Substudy 3 
and treated with a blinded treatment assignment for up to 52 weeks. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
An overview of the randomisation is showed in Figure 1. The rationale for re-randomizing only 
induction responders who received upadacitinib 15, 30 or 45 mg QD was to ensure that no subject 
received a dose during maintenance that was higher than what was received in the induction period. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary focus of the safety presentations was the SA_C population, a subset of the Safety 
population (all subjects who received study drug) who were upadacitinib 45 mg 8-week induction 
responders and who were enrolled under the protocol for 44- or 52-week maintenance treatment 
period in Cohort 1. In addition, safety summaries were provided for other safety populations. The 
standard safety analyses included reporting of AEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), 
laboratory measurements, and vital signs measurements.  
Frequency tables and exposure-adjusted event rate (EAER) per 100 patient-years (PYs) tables of 
subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by system organ class (SOC) and by 
preferred term (PT) as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary were 
provided by treatment group. All continuous laboratory parameters and vital signs variables at each 
visit were summarized by treatment group. Frequency tables of subjects meeting criteria for potentially 
clinically significant (PCS) laboratory values and for PCS vital sign values were provided by treatment 
group. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1,046 patients were enrolled in the study. Among all enrolled subjects, 617 subjects had 
completed the study and 429 subjects had prematurely discontinued from the study. Among the 1,044 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug, 6 were excluded from the ITT population due to 
site non-compliance.  
Recruitment 
A total of 1,046 subjects were enrolled from 299 sites in 43 countries.   
First Subject First Visit: 14 December 2016  
Last Subject Last Visit: 13 December 2021 
Baseline data 
Key demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the placebo and 
upadacitinib treatment groups. Approximately 45% of subjects in each group were ≥ 18 years to < 40 
years, and another 45% of subjects in each group were ≥ 40 years to < 65 years and approximately 
half of subjects were biologic therapy-intolerant or inadequate responder (Bio-IR).

Number analysed 
A total of 6 adolescent subjects were enrolled, all of whom came from induction Study M14-675. Of the 
6 adolescent subjects, 2 (1 male and 1 female) were randomized to the upadacitinib 30 mg group and 
4 were randomized to the placebo group (2 males and 2 females). In Study M14-234 Substudy 3, all 6 
adolescent subjects were enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Efficacy results 
According to the MAH, no efficacy conclusions can be drawn based on the small number of adolescents 
enrolled. 
Safety results 
Summary of the overall safety data presented in the final CSR 
Upadacitinib is known to be associated with an increased risk of serious infections, opportunistic 
infections, herpes zoster, hepatic transaminase elevations, anemia, neutropenia, creatinine 
phosphokinase (CPK) elevations, and increases in lipid parameters and weight. There is general 
concern on the risk for malignancy, major adverse cardiac event (MACE), venous thromboembolic 
event (VTE), and gastrointestinal (GI) perforations based on potential class effects for the JAK 
inhibitors. A class referral is currently ongoing (EMEA/H/A-20/1517). 
Since this submission not only includes paediatric data but also the final study report from Study M14-
234, a summary of the overall safety data was presented. According to the MAH, upadacitinib 15 and 
30 mg were generally safe and well-tolerated in the maintenance treatment for UC subjects, and no 
new safety risk was observed compared with the known safety profile of upadacitinib. 
Table 1. Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and All Deaths per 100 
Patient-Years (SA-C population) 
No death was reported in the maintenance treatment period. In the primary analysis data set (SA_C, 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and who were 8-week clinical responders to 
upadacitinib 45 mg induction therapy), the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse

events (TEAEs) included nasopharyngitis in all treatment groups. The most frequently reported TEAEs 
also included worsening of UC (preferred term [PT]: colitis ulcerative) and arthralgia in the placebo 
group, worsening of UC in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, and blood CPK increased in the upadacitinib 
30 mg group.  
No adverse events of special interest in the categories of active tuberculosis (TB) and lymphoma were 
reported in the maintenance treatment period (Table 2). In the SA_C population, the event rates of 
serious infection and opportunistic infection (excluding TB and herpes zoster) were not higher in the 
upadacitinib treatment groups compared with the placebo group. Herpes zoster was reported in 
subjects in the 2 upadacitinib treatment groups with higher event rates on upadacitinib 30 mg; no 
events were reported in placebo group. Malignancy excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) was 
reported infrequently across all treatment groups. Three NMSC events were reported, all in the 
upadacitinib 30 mg group. No adjudicated GI perforation was reported in subjects on upadacitinib. One 
event of adjudicated MACE was reported in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, and 2 events of adjudicated 
VTE were each reported in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups. 
Table 2. Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest per 
100 Patient-Years (SA-C population) 
Consistent with other indications, the events of neutropenia, CPK elevation, and transaminase 
increases were generally reported more frequently in subjects on upadacitinib than those on placebo. 
Most of the laboratory-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, nonserious, and uncommonly 
led to study drug discontinuation. 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or 4 laboratory values and potentially 
clinically significant vital signs were generally infrequent. In the SA_C population, worsening of UC and 
anemia were more frequently reported in subjects treated with placebo than those on upadacitinib, 
which may be related to the improvement of underlying disease of UC in upadacitinib-treated subjects.  
Summary of the paediatric data 
Five of the 6 adolescent subjects reported TEAEs during Study M14-234 Substudy 3 with  
events reported during placebo treatment for 3 subjects and during upadacitinib treatment 
for 2 subjects (Table 3). No treatment-emergent SAEs were reported and no action was

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This report includes the submission of a completed paediatric study for Rinvoq, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006.  
Study M14-234 is part of the ulcerative colitis clinical development program. Study M14-234 
substudy 3 was a phase 3 maintenance study with the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg once daily compared with placebo in subjects with moderately to 
severely active UC who achieved clinical response following induction therapy from the phase 2 and 
phase 3 induction studies. 
An interim report of M14-234 substudy 3 (data cut-off date 30 April 2021) was submitted as part of 
the grouped extension application with Type II variation for ulcerative colitis (UC, 
EMEA/H/C/004760/X/0012/G). This submission includes the final study report, with last subject last 
visit 13 Dec 2021. 
Study M14-234 enrolled adult subjects 18 to 75 years of age. In addition, adolescent subjects 16 and 
17 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg who met the definition of Tanner Stage 5 were also eligible if 
allowed by local regulations/institutional review boards/independent ethics committees.

A total of 1,046 patients were enrolled in the study, including 6 adolescent subjects. According to 
the MAH, no efficacy conclusions can be drawn based on the small number of adolescents enrolled. 
This is agreed on. 
Summary of the overall safety data presented in the final CSR 
Since this submission not only includes paediatric data but also the final study report from Study M14-
234, a summary of the overall safety data was presented. No death was reported in the maintenance 
treatment period. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events included 
nasopharyngitis, worsening of UC, and blood CPK increased. Among adverse events of special interest, 
no cases of active tuberculosis or lymphoma were reported. The event rates of serious infection and 
opportunistic infection (excluding TB and herpes zoster) were similar in the upadacitinib and placebo 
group. Herpes zoster was more frequent in the upadacitinib treatment groups than in the placebo 
group. There were seven cases of malignancy reported, one in the placebo and upadacitinib 15 mg 
groups, respectively, and 5 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group. Among these, three were NMSC, all 
reported in the upadacitinib 30 mg group. No adjudicated GI perforation was reported in subjects on 
upadacitinib. One event of adjudicated MACE was reported in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, and 2 
events of adjudicated VTE were each reported in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups. No 
additional cases of malignancy, MACE or VTE was reported compared to the data assessed within 
X/12/G. The risk for malignancy, MACE and VTE is currently under review in the class referral 
(EMEA/H/A-20/1517), and although the recent findings confer some concern, no actions are warranted 
within the current procedure. 
Summary of the paediatric data 
Among the 6 adolescent patients, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 5/6 patients (3 
during treatment with placebo and 2 during treatment with upadacitinib; these were influenza-like 
illness, fatigue, and acne in one patient and mouth ulceration in one patient). No SAEs were reported. 
The presented data does not constitute any new safety concerns, and no actions are warranted. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
This report includes the submission of a completed paediatric study for Rinvoq, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006.  
Within this procedure, the MAH submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006 the final study report for the ulcerative colitis M14-234 maintenance substudy, including 
6 adolescent subjects. 
Since this submission not only includes paediatric data but also the final study report from Study M14-
234, a summary of the overall safety data was presented. Among the AESIs, herpes zoster was more 
frequent in the upadacitinib treatment groups than in the placebo group. This is a known safety 
concern for upadacitinib. A dose-dependent association was observed for malignancy, in particular 
NMSC. Further, one event of adjudicated MACE was reported in the upadacitinib 30 mg group, and 2 
events of adjudicated VTE were each reported in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups. The risk 
for malignancy, MACE and VTE is currently under review in a class referral (EMEA/H/A-20/1517), and 
although the recent findings confer some concern, no actions are warranted within the current 
procedure. 
Among the 6 adolescent patients, no new safety concerns were identified.

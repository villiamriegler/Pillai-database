1. 
Introduction 
Visudyne  contains  verteporfin,  a  benzoporphyrin  derivative,  which  is  a  photosensitiser  (i.e.  light-
activated) molecule developed for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with visible light.  
Visudyne was co-developed by Novartis and QLT Inc. and was authorised in the EU 
1)  on  27  July  2000  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation  (CNV) 
that  is  predominantly  classic  (classic  component  ≥  50%  of  the  entire  CNV  lesion)  and  due  to  aged-
related macular degeneration (AMD); 
2) on 20 March 2001 for the treatment of patients with subfoveal CNV due to pathologic myopia, and 
3)  on  22  August  2002  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal  occult  CNV  due  to  AMD  with 
evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression. 
Visudyne  therapy  is  a  two-step  process:  a  single  dose  of  Visudyne  is  administered  as  a  10-minute 
intravenous  infusion  followed  15  minutes  after  the  start  of  the  infusion  by  light  application  of 
600mW/cm2 for 83 seconds (dose of 50 J/cm2). Patients should be re-evaluated every 3 months. In the 
event of recurrent choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) leakage, Visudyne therapy may be given up to 
4 times per year. 
As summarised above, Visudyne was originally approved in the EU (27 July 2000) for the treatment 
of patients with predominantly classic subfoveal neovascularisation (CNV) due to AMD (study BPD 
OCR  002  A&B-TAP,  n=609).  Subsequently  (20  March  2001,  via  a  type  II  variation)  the  indication 
was extended to patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathologic myopia 
(study BPD OCR 003-PM).  
In  August  2002,  the  indications  for  Visudyne  were  extended  (via  another  type  II  variation)  to  a 
broader  AMD  patient  population  (for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal  occult  CNV  due  to 
AMD with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression). This latter approval was based on the 
two-year  results  of  Study  BPD  OCR  003-AMD  (VIP  AMD).  At  that  time,  it  was  noted  that  the 
primary  efficacy  objective  was  not  reached  at  one  year  in  either  subgroups,  although  results  were 
numerically more in favour of verteporfin in AMD patients with occult lesions. The CHMP, however,  
considered  it  acceptable  to  positively  interpret  the  reported  difference  in  the  primary  efficacy 
parameter between verteporfin treatment and placebo treatment of 3.7 % (p=0.517) at 12 months, with 
a  responder  rate  of  49.3  %  and  45.6  %  in  the  two  groups,  respectively,  in  connection  with  the 
corresponding  24  months  results  of  a  difference  of  12.9  %  (p=0.023),  with  46.2  %  versus  33.3  % 
responders in the two groups, respectively.  
However,  in  the  light  of  the  above,  the  CHMP  requested  additional  investigation  in  the  ‘occult’ 
indication,  in  the  form  of  a  confirmatory  study  in  this  patient  population.  Therefore  a  post-approval 
commitment  (FUM  014)  was  requested.  The  VIO  (Visudyne  In  Occult)  study  was  to  confirm  the 
treatment effect shown in patients with occult CNV and evidence of recent disease progression in the 
VIP  AMD  study.  The  VIO  (BPD  OCR  013)  study  protocol  was  approved  by  the  CHMP  in  August 
2003.  
Interim  (one-year)  results  of  VIO  confirmatory  study  were  in  line  with  the  one-year  results  of  VIP 
AMD  study,  since  they  did  not  show  any  statistically  significant  difference  between  Visudyne  and 
placebo for either co-primary or secondary efficacy variables. 
The two-year VIO study results were provided by the MAH in August 2006 and discussed in October 
2006 CHMP in the context of FUM 014.1 (see section 3.2 below) 
The  October  2006  conclusions  of  this  FUM  evaluation  consisted  in  (i)  a  request  of  further  data  
(FUM 014.2) and (ii) of a submission of a Type II variation to change the SPC. 
On 19 December 2006, the MAH submitted both the additional data requested (FUM 014.2) and the 
Type  II  Variation  application  (II/53.  NB:  to  change  sections  4.2  and  5.1  only).  The  MAH  data 
submission in answer to each of the points outlined above are discussed individually in this report.

Clinical aspects 
Variation  application  II/53  is  focused  on  the  Visudyne  therapy  indication  of  occult  with  no  classic 
choroidal  neovascularization  (CNV)  due  to  age-related  macular  degeneration  (AMD).  The  data 
submitted describes the results of the BPD OCR 013 (VIO) study in patients with occult CNV due to 
AMD. As mentioned above, the VIO study was a post-approval commitment to confirm the results of 
the BPD OCR 003 AMD (VIP AMD) study, upon which approval for the occult indication was based. 
Both  the  VIP  AMD  and  VIO  studies  were  Phase  III,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre, 
double-masked studies that followed patients for 24 months. 
It should be borne in mind that the VIP-AMD study was designed to include only the patients who had 
been  excluded  from  the  TAP  (Treatment  of  age-related  macular  degeneration  with  photodynamic 
therapy) A&B studies and who were determined to have occult CNV according to the assessment of 
the central reading centre (n=61 or 10% of the TAP patients) since these patients also showed benefit 
from Visudyne. 
The VIO study was to confirm the treatment effect shown in patients with occult CNV and evidence of 
recent disease progression in the VIP AMD study. Most of the patients in VIP AMD study had occult 
with no classic CNV (258 of 339 patients: 76%). Nevertheless, VIO study included a more restricted 
patient population who showed a greater treatment benefit in the VIP AMD study.  
The two-year VIO study results were provided by the MAH in August 2006 and evaluated in October 
2006 in the context of FUM 014.1. A summary of this evaluation is provided in section 3.2.1 below. 
2.1   Study OCR 013 (VIO) 
Study  BPD  OCR  013  (VIO)  was  a  2-year  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-masked,  multi-
centre, Phase III study of the treatment of occult with no classic subfoveal CNV lesions secondary to 
AMD using Visudyne therapy compared with placebo. Analysis was planned after 12 months and 24 
months  of  follow-up.  A  total  of  364  patients  were  enrolled  at  43  centres.  Angiographic  lesion 
characteristics  were  to  be  confirmed  by  a  central  reading  centre  (Wisconsin)  prior  to  enrolling  a 
patient. Patients were stratified by study centre and randomized to Visudyne therapy or placebo in a 
2:1 ratio, respectively. 
Study Population:  
Patients were men or women age 50 years or older who had to have: 
- occult CNV secondary only to AMD in the study eye, without any other concurrent retinal disease 
present that may also be associated with CNV;   
-  presumed  recent  progression  of  occult  CNV  in  the  study  eye  defined  as  blood  associated  with  the 
lesion  or  showed  progression  of  disease  within  the  3  months  before  randomization  to  treatment, 
defined as either: 1) a documented loss of vision (6 or more letters with the ETDRS chart or at least 3 
lines with a Snellen chart) using best-corrected visual acuity assessments or 2) documented fluorescein 
angiographic evidence of a 10% increase in the lesion’s greatest linear dimension; 
-  lesions  characteristics  as  determined  by  fluorescein  angiography:  evidence  that  1)  occult    CNV 
involved  the geometric centre of the foveal avascular zone; 2) the lesion had only occult CNV with no 
classic CNV; 3) the area of occult CNV occupied at least 50% of the total lesion. 
- a best-corrected visual acuity score in the study eye between 73 and 34 letters (approximate Snellen 
equivalent of 20/40 to 20/200), inclusive.  
Patients had to meet at least one of the following criteria: 
  1- CNV lesion < 4 MPS (Macular Photocoagulation Study) disc areas (DA). 
  2- Visual acuity score <65 letters. 
In the case that both eyes were eligible, only one eye was to be treated.

Four  co-primary  analyses  of  the  patients’  responder  rate  were  planned:  proportion  of  patients  who 
lose, at Month 12 and at Month 24, fewer than 15 letters (<3 lines) and fewer than 30 letters (<6 lines) 
of best-corrected visual acuity in the study eye from baseline.  
Visudyne  was  administered  according  to  the  posology,  the  method  of  administration  and  the  re-
treatment  procedure  currently  approved.  At  baseline  and  at  each  follow-up  visit,  patients  underwent 
the  assessments  procedures  developed  for  the  TAP  A&B  and  VIP  studies.  Visual  acuity  (VA)  was 
measured with an ETDRS chart using the procedure developed for the TAP/VIP studies. Indocyanin 
green  (ICG)  angiography  and  Optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT)  explorations  were  added  in 
response  to  the  request  by  the  CHMP,  but  were  carried  out  only  at  centres  with  ICG  or  OCT 
capability. These data were collected for descriptive analysis only at baseline, months 12 and 24 (and 
in addition, at months 3 and 6 for patients who had OCT) and assessed by a central reading centre.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables were similar to TAP and VIP studies: Proportion of patients whose best-
corrected visual acuity decreased to fewer than 34 letters (approximate Snellen equivalent of 20/200); 
Change  from  baseline  in  visual  acuity  score;  cumulative  proportion  of  patients  who  develop 
predominantly classic CNV in the study eye (identified by the Investigator and confirmed by a central 
reading centre). 
Safety variables: incidence of adverse events in both treatment groups. 
When available, ICG was also used for investigation of severe vision decrease.  
The  responder  rate  of  patients  who  lose  <15  letters  of  VA  in  VIP  AMD  study  at  12  month  for  the 
corresponding subgroup population was the basis for the sample size calculation. It was estimated that 
this  responder  rate  would  be  approximately  40%  for  the  placebo  group  and  60%  for  the  Visudyne 
therapy group at 12 months. 336 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 20% difference in a two-
sided chi-square test. The alpha level used in the sample size calculation was adjusted to 0.0125 for 
the four comparisons planned for the study. To allow for patients lost to follow-up, 360 patients were 
to  be  enrolled  in  the  study.  This  sample  size  was  also  considered  to  be  acceptable  for  the  test 
performed  at  24  months  (larger  difference  expected),  or  for  the  test  performed  on  the  proportion  of 
patients who lose <30 letters (less variability expected).

56.6 letters (57.1 letters in Visudyne group, 55.7 letters in placebo group). All patients but 9 (existence 
of classic graded as questionable) had occult CNV at baseline with no classic CNV present. The mean 
area  of  the  total  lesion  at  baseline  as  determined  by  fluorescein  angiograms  (FA)  was  3.2  disc  area 
(DA) in Visudyne group (range 0.5 to 8.0 DA) and 3.3 DA in the placebo group (range 0.5 to 6.0 DA).  
Significant differences between the two groups in the baseline disease state and lesion characteristics 
based  on  FA  was  only  observed  for  blood  as  a  lesion  component,  which  was  present  in  13%  of 
Visudyne  patients  and  5%  of  placebo  patients  (P=.0192).  About  80%  of  patients  in  each  group  met 
only 1  of  the  criteria  for  disease  progression  (blood associated  with  the  lesion in  more  than  80%  of 
cases in each group).  
Overall,  13  patients  (3.6%)  did  not  meet  all  of  the  inclusion  or  exclusion  criteria  for  the  study  [9 
patients  (5  Visudyne,  4  placebo)  who  had  the  existence  of  classic  CNV  as  questionable,  2  patients  
(1 Visudyne and 1 placebo) whose visual acuity (VA) did not meet the inclusion criteria for lesion size 
and 3 Visudyne patients whose VA was out of the range]. The most common protocol deviations were 
study visits that occurred outside the specified window and a missed visit. No patients were excluded 
from the ITT analysis or from the evaluable analysis.

The CHMP view was that in Study BPD OCR 013 (VIO) co-primary criteria were tested at α level of 
0.0125.  Thus,  no  statistical  significance  was  seen  for  either  of  the  24-month  co-primary  criteria,  as 
described below: 
- % of patients loosing less than 15 letters at M24 (p = 0.2998) 
- % of patients loosing less than 30 letters at M24 (p = 0.6022) 
Additionally, no statistical significant results were previously observed at Month 12: 
- % of patients loosing less than 15 letters at M12 (p = 0.1581) 
- % of patients loosing less than 30 letters at M12 (p = 0.8680) 
Finally,  even  if  the  proportion  of  responders  remains  slightly  in  favour  of  Visudyne  (differences  of 
5.8%; P=0.2998 and 2.5%; P=0.6022 for loss < 15 letters and <30 letters of VA, respectively), VIO 
results do not replicate the favourable 24-month results previously observed in VIP study.

Secondary Visual Acuity variables: 
Secondary Visual Acuity variables did not reach statistical significance any more at Month 24:  
1-  Proportion  of  patients  whose  best-corrected  visual  acuity  decreased  to  fewer  than  34  letters 
(approximately 20/200, i.e. threshold for legal blindness): 
The  same  trend  as  previous  results  is  observed  [i.e.  no  statistical  significance;  Month  12,  between 
groups difference = 6.7% (P=0.1878) and Month 24, between groups difference = 11.8% (P=0.0278)]. 
2- Change from baseline in visual acuity score: 
At Month 12, Visudyne patients had lost an average of 11.2 letters of VA, compared to an average loss 
of 13.3 letters in the placebo group (between groups difference = 2.1 letters; P=0.2563).  
At Month 24, Visudyne patients had lost an average of 14.8 letters of VA from baseline compared to 
an  average  loss  of  17.8  letters  in  the  placebo  group  (between  groups  difference  =  3.0  letters; 
P=0.1379).

Other Secondary Efficacy Variables 
Except  for  patients  who  had  CNV  leakage  (Month  12:  -15.5%;  P=0.0099  and  Month  24:  -15.3%; 
P=0.0061),  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups were  seen  for  the  other  secondary 
variables [patients who had complete closure of occult CNV or who developed any classic CNV or a 
predominantly classic CNV lesion (Month 12: -0,9%; p=0.7866 and Month 24: -1,8%; p=0.5011)]. 
The CHMP considered that the VIO results do not confirm the previous results seen in VIP study at 
Month 24. Overall, in the VIO study there was no statistically significant difference between groups 
for co-primary or secondary variables.

Among the 364 patients included, 221 ICG angiography assessments and 41 OCT assessments were 
done.  Today,  ICG  angiography  and  OCT,  the  key  retinal  examination,  are  necessary  tools  to 
adequately  refine  the  diagnostic  in  patients  with  occult  only  CNV  lesions  and  to  provide  additional 
objective information to treat these patients with photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, since ICG 
and OCT were not systematically performed and since a small number of examinations was done, they 
were not very contributive:  
ICG assessments were obtained for 153 Visudyne patients (62.7%) and 68 placebo patients (56.7%) at 
baseline, and 118 Visudyne patients (48.4%) and 59 placebo patients (49.2%) at Month 24. Overall, 
except for the area of the total lesion which seemed to increase more in the placebo group (≈+1.000 
DA)  than  in  the  Visudyne  group,  these  results  suggested  a  similar  trend  in  the  evolution  of  the 
variables in both groups over the course of the study. 
OCT was performed at baseline and Months 3, 6, 12 and 24 at centers that had OCT capability. OCT 
variables included measurements of retinal thickness, subretinal thickness, and morphological features 
(intraretinal  edema,  cystoid  spaces,  subretinal  fluid,  serous/hemorrhagic  PED,  vitreoretinal  interface 
abnormalities,  CNV,  and  CNV  subtype).  Overall,  a  similar  trend  was  observed  for  most  of  the 
variables  in  both  groups  over  the  course  of  the  study,  but  a  too  small  number  of  OCT  assessments 
(Visudyne, 24 and placebo, 17 at baseline) was obtained to draw any conclusion. 
VIO angiograms re-grading results  
The VIO study was intended to replicate and confirm the previous benefit observed at month 24 with 
Visudyne  in  VIP  AMD  study  (occult  lesions).  The  VIO  study  did  not  achieve  any  of  the  four  co-
primary endpoints selected as clinically relevant by the Applicant (% of responders at 1 and 2 years 
<15 or <30 letters) and therefore, the 24 months VIP results cannot be considered as replicated.  
Nevertheless,  all  previous  placebo-controlled  studies  (TAP  A&B  and  VIP  AMD)  used  the  same 
central Reading Center (Wilmer) but the VIO study used another central reading center (Wisconsin) to 
grade or evaluate fluorescein angiograms (FA). Therefore, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(after  its  review  of  the  1-year  data)  was  of  the  view  that  the  use  of  different  centers  could  have 
contributed  to  discrepancies  between  “occult”  results.  Then,  for  consistency  of  angiographic 
interpretation  across  these  studies,  it  was  decided  that  the  FA  from  VIO  should  be  re-graded  by  the 
Wilmer Reading Center and a re-grading protocol was prospectively designed. The re-grading of FA 
from VIO was performed on all FA from baseline. It was conducted by the Wilmer Reading Center 
using the same grading protocol and procedures that were used for the VIP AMD study.

The CHMP considered that no statistically significant difference between Visudyne and placebo was 
observed  in  VIO  efficacy  study  results  for  the  total  population  as  graded  by  either  Wisconsin  or 
Wilmer  centers.  Therefore,  the  choice  of  the  grading  centre  cannot  explain  the  results  observed  in 
study VIO. 
Conclusion on the two-year efficacy results of VIO controlled study  
Study OCR 013 was conducted as a Follow-Up Measure to confirm the treatment benefit of Visudyne 
therapy previously demonstrated in study BPD OCR 003-AMD (VIP AMD) regarding AMD patients 
with  occult  lesions  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing  disease  progression.  The  study  protocol  was 
accepted by the CHMP. Based on previous VIP analyses, treatment benefit was found to be highest in 
patients  with  occult  lesions  who  presented  with  either  smaller  lesions  or  lower  visual  acuity  scores, 
specifically  lesions  <  4  MPS  DA  or  visual  acuity  <  65  letters.  Therefore,  Study  OCR  013  was 
designed  to  assess  Visudyne  therapy  in  this  latter  restricted  group  of  patients  with  occult  with  no 
classic choroidal neovascularization at baseline. 
Two definitions of responders (patients who lost less than 3 lines and less than 6 lines from baseline) 
and two time points for analysis (at 12 and 24 months) were considered as clinically equally important 
to  justify  the  use  of  all  four  analyses  for  the  primary  evaluation  of  efficacy  with  the  appropriate 
adjustment of the P value (0.0125). However, differences between Visudyne and placebo did not reach 
statistical  significance  for  either  the  four  co-primary  criteria  or  secondary  visual  or  angiographic 
criteria.

The re-grading procedure by the centralised Wilmer center does not either lead to significant efficacy 
results. Therefore, the choice of the grading center  cannot explain the lack of statistical significance 
for the results observed in study VIO. 
Based on these VIO results, the efficacy of PDT with verteporfin in AMD patients with occult lesions 
with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression is not confirmed even though VIO study was 
designed to assess the efficacy in a more favourable responder group of patients. 
2.3  
Combined analyses 
The MAH also submitted additional results of combined analyses involving the VIP and VIO studies 
or the TAP A&B, VIP and VIO studies. Results of each study are reported below with the results of 
combined analyses. 
Combined analysis from VIO and VIP AMD studies 
Studies  were  similar  in  design  and  conduct,  but  there  were  differences  between  study  baseline 
characteristics: VIO study patients were 4 years older, had VA scores 10 letters lower, and had smaller 
lesions than VIP AMD study patients. Moreover, the central reading center was different between the 
studies TAP/VIP and VIO studies. For the VIP AMD study, the analyses focus on patients with occult 
CNV.  The  CNV  lesion  type  in  the  2  studies  was  the  same  (occult  with  no  classic  CNV);  however, 
lesion type was assessed differently between the studies. In the VIO study, the central reading center 
assessed  the  lesion  to  determine  eligibility  before  study  entry.  In  VIP  AMD  study,  the  investigator 
determined  eligibility,  after  which  the  central  Wilmer  reading  center  assessed  confirm  the 
investigator's assessment of lesion characteristics. For baseline lesion size and baseline VA score, the 
entry criteria were different between the VIO and VIP AMD studies. Lesion size at entry could have 
been larger in the VIP AMD study, while baseline VA score could have been better (no upper limit 
and  lower  limit  of  50  letters  in  VIP  AMD,  compared  with  73-34  letters  in  VIO).  The  combined 
analyses of these 2 studies include a total of 622 patients with occult CNV due to AMD (410 treated 
with Visudyne, and 212 who received placebo).

A second combined analysis is provided. This analysis included, in addition to VIO and VIP studies, a 
small exploratory subgroup from TAP A&B studies (n=61). The total population reaches 683 patients 
with occult CNV due to AMD (451 treated with Visudyne, and 232 who received placebo).

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  combined  analyses  do  not  meet  the  requirement  of  the  CHMP  post-
approval commitment, the primary objective of which was to confirm the 24-month results observed 
in VIP AMD study.  
Secondly, the main aim of a combined analysis is to assess more precisely the effect of the treatment 
tested.  To  reach  this  objective,  the  studies  included  should  either  show  negative  or  positive  results, 
should be similarly well conducted and should provide a comparable level of credibility. 
Therefore, the necessary conditions to combine the results of TAP A&B, VIP and VIO studies or VIP 
and VIO studies are not fulfilled, since: 
-  criteria  for  inclusion  (Patients’  visual  acuity  and  lesions  characteristics)  as  previously  described  in 
table 1 were different across the studies, 
- studies were not similarly well conducted in regard to the assessment of efficacy in AMD patients 
with occult lesions (as subgroups were used in TAP and VIP), and therefore, cannot provide a similar 
reliable proof of efficacy. 
Thus, the nature of these combined analyses is debatable.  
The  intention  of  the  CHMP  was  to  check  whether  the  24  months  VIP  results  can  or  can  not  be 
replicated in  a confirmatory study. Since the VIO  study results (detailed above) do not replicate the 
VIP results, pooled analyses cannot bring any additional helpful information.  
It  should  also  be  pointed  out  that  the  MAH  assumed  that  a  more  responsive  group  of  patients  to 
treatment was selected in VIO (based on the results of an exploratory subgroup of patients from VIP).

However, at 24 months, pooled results from either VIP and VIO studies or TAP A&B, VIP and VIO 
studies are mainly driven by the VIP study results, which remains, despite some weakness, the only 
one leading to positive results for the occult population.  
2.4  Safety Results (VIO Study) 
Totally,  950  Visudyne  treatments  were  received  by  244  Visudyne  patients.  581  Placebo  treatments 
were received by 120 placebo patients. Furthermore, 83 Visudyne treatments were received on open 
label by respectively 24 Visudyne patients and 13 placebo patients. Among the 581 placebo treatment, 
5  patients  received  7  Visudyne  treatments  by  error.  Those  patients  were  not  counted  as  having 
received Visudyne treatment in any AE nor deaths. 
More  patients  in  Visudyne  group  experienced  adverse  events  (respectively  88.1%  vs  81.7%),  ocular 
adverse events (42.2% vs 39.2%), deaths (4.1% vs 0.8%), serious adverse events (31.1% vs 25.0%), 
discontinuation (11.9% vs 3.3%), and discontinuation due to events that the investigator suspected to 
be related to treatment (1.6% vs 0%).  
Adverse events tended to be more severe in intensity in the Visudyne group than the placebo group: 
18% vs 8%. The incidence of all associated study eye adverse events is 2 fold higher in the Visudyne 
group than in the placebo group. More systemic adverse events (more than 4 fold higher) are observed 
with the Visudyne group than the placebo group. Infusion related back pain (10.2% vs 0, respectively 
in  Visudyne  and  placebo  group)  is  the  most  frequent  systemic  associated  adverse  event.  All  these 
findings show that Visudyne is not well tolerated. However, all these events are already listed in the 
SPC. 
More  deaths  were  observed  in  the  Visudyne  group  (10,  4.1%)  than  in  Placebo  group  (1,  0.8%), 
although  patients’  characteristics  at  baseline  in  both  groups  were  well  balanced:  age,  weight, 
cardiovascular  history,  pulmonary  history,  hepatic  history.  The  mean  time  to  onset  after  the  last 
injection  was  289.4  days  with  a  range  from  11  days  to  612  days  in  Visudyne  group.  Three  cases 
(intestinal  blockage,  stroke  and  myocardial  infarction)  occurred  less  than  3  months  after  the  last 
injection. Among the 11 deaths, there were 4 cases of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia (one case 
occurred  in  a  placebo  patient,  this  case  received  Visudyne  by  error  at  the  first  injection),  3  cases  of 
cardiac disorders, 2 cases of carcinoma, one case of stroke and one case of intestinal blockage.  
Among the 10 deaths in Visudyne group, 3 cases were cardiovascular: 
-  worsening  ischemic  cardiomyopathy  occurred  in  a  75  years  old  woman  163  days  after  the  last  
regimen of Visudyne (she received 5 regimens);  
- myocardial infarction in a 74 years old man 11 days after the last dose of Visudyne and 24  hours 
after knee replacement;  
- sudden heart attack 379 days after the last dose of Visudyne.  
Two of these cases occurred more than 6 months after the last injection. In the remaining case, even 
though knee replacement surgery is a risk factor, death occurred 11 days after the last Visudyne dose. 
For the remaining 7 cases, underlying disease, age (≥ 74 years) and/or concomitant drugs could be an 
explanation of the death. 
Deaths  were  probably  not  related  to  Visudyne,  however  it  seemed  surprising  that  all  fatal  outcomes 
except one were seen in the Visudyne group. Additionally, a discrepancy was found in the total SAEs 
(respectively in Visudyne and Placebo group, 76 and 30) and deaths + withdrawal + other serious AEs 
(respectively  in  Visudyne  and  Placebo  group  10+10+57=77  and  1+2+35=38).  Finally,  6  serious 
associated adverse events were observed in the Visudyne group and none in the placebo group. 
In the CHMP assessment of FUM 014.1 in October 2006, the MAH was requested to elaborate further 
explanation other than just "spurious finding" in order to justify the unbalanced frequency of deaths 
between Visudyne and the placebo group. 
11/20 
© EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The answer to this first request by the CHMP was handled in the context on FUM 014.2, which was 
submitted in parallel to Variation II/53. Assessment of the data presented by the MAH as FUM 014.2 
are inherently linked to the evaluation of application II/53, and are therefore  part of this assessment 
report. 
Based on (1) the MAH’s medical evaluation of the deaths and their lack of temporal relationship to 
treatment, as well as (2) the similarity in the overall incidence of death between treatment groups in all 
the  Visudyne  placebo-controlled  studies,  and  (3)  the  comparison  of  the  proportion  of  deaths  in  the 
Visudyne group to the general population of the same age group, the MAH expressed their view that 
the higher proportion of deaths observed in the Visudyne group of the VIO study is most likely to be a 
chance finding and unlikely to be a true finding. According to this view, in the VIO study, a higher 
proportion of deaths occurred in the Visudyne group than in the placebo group (10 Visudyne patients, 
4.1% versus 1 placebo patient, 0.8%). The MAH carefully evaluated these deaths, and could not find a 
relationship with treatment, as follows: 
• The deaths were from a variety of causes: 
- 3 cardiovascular: (1) worsening ischemic cardiomyopathy (started >5 months after the last treatment, 
(2)  myocardial  infarction  (11  days  after  the  last  treatment),  and  (3)  sudden  heart  attack  (19  months 
after the last treatment). 
-  2  pulmonary  embolism  events  (one  event  in  the  Visudyne  group  started  20  months  after  the  last 
treatment, and one event in the placebo group [in which Visudyne was given to the patient in error at 
Day  0  of  the  study]  started  more  than  5  months  after  the  last  placebo  treatment  [and  more  than  20 
months after the patient's Visudyne treatment]) 
- 2 pneumonia (both started >9 months after the last treatment) 
-  1  each  of  intestinal  blockage  (started  74  days  after  the  last  treatment),  metastatic  colon  cancer 
(diagnosed 15 months after the last treatment), cerebrovascular accident (started 82 days after the last 
treatment),  and  leukemia/pancytopenia  (started  15  months  after  the  last  treatment).  In  all  cases, 
underlying disease and age are plausible explanations for death. 
• The deaths did not have a temporal relationship to treatment (all but 3 events leading to death started 
>5 months after treatment; see also the previous bullet). 
• None of the deaths was suspected to be related to treatment, as assessed by the investigator. 
For their meeting to discuss the 24-month VIO study data, the Verteporfin Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee  (DSMC)  also  reviewed  these  deaths  and  stated  that  there  was  no  clustering  of  apparent 
cause of death in the verteporfin group and no apparent theme in the apparent increased death rates in 
that group. The DSMC concluded that the safety results in the VIO study were consistent with known 
adverse event profile of verteporfin therapy.  Table 10 lists the 11 deaths from the VIO study.

Table 10. 
Deaths from the VIO study 
In  the  MAH’s  view,  the  following  evidence  also  contributes  to  their  assessment  that  the  finding  (a 
higher proportion of deaths in the Visudyne group) is unlikely to be a true finding: 
•  The  overall  incidence  of  deaths  in  the  combined  placebo-controlled,  randomized  studies  is  nearly 
identical between the Visudyne and placebo groups (3.1% and 2.9%, respectively; Table 11), and the 
incidence of deaths in the VIO placebo group (0.8%) appears to be unexpectedly low compared to the 
incidence of deaths in the other randomized placebo-controlled studies (2.6% in VIP AMD and 4.3% 
in TAP A+B).  
Table 11. 
Deaths in placebo-controlled Visudyne studies (all patients) 
The patients in these studies had the same disease (AMD), were of the same age group, had similar 
underlying  medical  conditions  at  baseline,  and  received  the  same  regimen  of  either  Visudyne  or 
placebo. The MAH’s considered it valid to combine these randomized, placebo-controlled studies to 
determine the overall proportion of deaths in each treatment group, as the deaths were from systemic 
causes and the specific subtype of AMD is irrelevant. Based on this combined analysis of death rates, 
the  MAH  concluded  that  the  overall  finding  that  the  incidence  of  deaths  is  similar  between  the 
Visudyne and placebo groups is robust and accurate.

Across studies, the range of incidence of deaths is 4.3% (TAP placebo group) to 0.8% (VIO placebo 
group).  The  incidence  of  deaths  in  the  VIO  Visudyne  group  (4.1%)  falls  within  this  range.  There  is 
more  variation  in  death  rates  across  the  placebo  groups  than  across  the  Visudyne  groups.  The 
incidence of death in the VIO placebo group is an outlying value, clearly the lowest incidence of the 3 
placebo groups, and much lower than the combined placebo group incidence. 
•  The  death  rate  in  the  VIO  Visudyne group  (4.1%)  was  similar  to  the  death  rate  in  the  general  US 
population for the age group of 75-79 years (4.36%) and lower than that for the age group of 80-84 
years (6.98%), based on national vital statistics reports (final data from 2003) (Hoyert et al 2006). The 
death rate in the VIO Visudyne group was also lower than the death rate in the general US population 
for the age group of 75-84 years (5.29%) (based on preliminary data from 2004) (Minino et al 2006). 
The VIO study was conducted in North America, primarily in the US. The average age at baseline of 
11 patients who died during the VIO study was 81 years, and 8 of these patients were older than 80 
years at baseline.) 
•  The  death  rate  in  the  VIO  placebo  group  (0.8%)  was  much  lower  than  the  expected  rate  in  the 
general  US  population.  (However,  this  patient  did  receive  one  Visudyne  treatment  in  error,  as 
footnoted in Table 10.) 
The MAH compared the incidence rates to other placebo-controlled studies: the incidence of deaths in 
Visudyne arm in the VIO study was similar to the TAP study, and the death in placebo group in the 
VIO study was particularly low. The death rate in the VIO study (4.1% for the mean age of 83 years) 
was similar to the death rates in general US population for the age group of 75-79 years (4.4%). The 
CHMP noted that the MAH did not try to provide any other explanation. 
The  difference  of  the  number  of  deaths  in  the  Visudyne  group  compared  to  placebo  was  still 
considered surprising by the CHMP. This phase III, randomized study included well balanced groups 
regarding the age, cardiovascular history, pulmonary embolism: 5/10 patients died of cardiovascular 
events.  It  is  agreed  that  the  time  to  onset  seems  not  in  favour  of  a  relationship.  However,  the 
explanation  of  the  MAH  mentioning  that  the  death  in  placebo  group  was  particularly  low  seemed 
rather simplistic. 
2.5   Request for Supplementary information (RfSI, March 2007) 
As  a  result  of  the  above  evaluations  and  consideration,  in  their  March  2007  plenary  meeting,  the 
CHMP requested the MAH to submit in writing the following supplementary information, and to then 
present in an Oral Explanation before the CHMP in April 2007: 
Question 1: 
Having considered the results of the confirmatory study VIO, the CHMP currently considers that the 
benefit / risk of Visudyne in the indication “treatment of patients with subfoveal occult CNV due to 
AMD  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing  disease  progression”  is  unfavourable  and  therefore  the 
indication should be deleted from section 4.1 of the SPC. Please comment on the benefit / risk of this 
indication. 
Question 2: 
A proposal for a DHCP letter to inform practitioners of the outcome of the VIO study and the deletion 
of the occult indication has to be submitted. 
Question 3 
A final SPC and PL, taking into account all the above recommendations from the CHMP, has to be 
provided (Highlighted version, showing all changes from the currently approved SPC and PL). 
2.6  Summary of the MAH’s response to the RfSI 
In  their  written  answer  to  the  RfSI,  and  in  the  Oral  Explanation,  the  MAH  argued  in  summary  that 
with regards to efficacy, verteporfin therapy in occult with no classic subfoveal CNV in the VIO study 
provided better vision outcomes for all variables at Month 12 and 24 compared to placebo, although it 
did  not  achieve  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  primary  efficacy  parameters.  Verteporfin

treatment benefit has always been observed in previous clinical trials, but the magnitude of this benefit 
has  varied.  The  greatest  benefit  was  observed  in  the  TAP  studies  and  the  least  benefit  in  the  VIO 
study. On this basis, in the view of the MAH the VIO study visual acuity results do not contradict the 
benefit observed for the occult CNV AMD subtype in previous studies. 
With regards to safety, in summary, having evaluated the imbalance of deaths between the treatment 
groups in the VIO study, the MAH concluded that there is no temporal relationship between the onset 
of the events leading to death and study treatment. Most of the deaths (8 of 11) can be linked to the 
patient's  medical  history.  None  of  the  deaths  were  suspected  to  be  related  to  treatment  by  the 
investigator. The DSMC for the VIO study concluded that "there were no undue concerns regarding 
adverse side effects. There is no apparent theme in the apparent increased death rates in the treatment 
group. All other adverse events were as expected." The deaths in the VIO study, as for the previous 
placebo-controlled  studies,  were  all  from  systemic  causes.  In  that  context,  the  specific  subtype  of 
AMD  is  irrelevant.  The  overall  death  rates  in  the  placebo-controlled  trials  (3.1%  and  2.9%  for 
verteporfin and placebo, respectively; are similar between treatment groups, as well as lower than the 
known death rates in the US population for ages 65 and older (≥3.6%). Death rates and causes have 
been  analysed  by  the  MAH  among  the  verteporfin  placebo-controlled  studies  and  relative  to  the 
general US population by appropriate age group and cause of death. These evaluations highlight the 
overall lower death rates in the studies (including the VIO verteporfin group) compared with the US 
population and the similar death rates among the studies, with the exception of the VIO placebo group 
rate which is much lower than the other study groups. The causes of deaths observed in VIO and other 
Visudyne  studies  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  general  population.  The  higher  rates  of 
discontinuation in the VIO study did not appear to be treatment-related, as the rate of discontinuation 
due to associated AEs in the VIO study was lower than that for the VIP AMD study and similar to that 
for  the  TAP  study.  Case  reports  from  Novartis  safety  database  do  not  show  any  pattern  that  may 
indicate an evidence of causal relationship between verteporfin treatment and the occurrence of death. 
In addition to the data from the clinical trials, the MAH claimed that ophthalmologists with expertise 
in  treating  diseases  of  the  retina  and  choroid  have  been  treating  their  patients  with  subfoveal  occult 
CNV secondary to AMD with verteporfin. This has been and currently is a standard therapeutic option 
for  the  management  of  CNV  in  clinical  practice.  Many  patients  with  occult  CNV  have  experienced 
excellent results with this treatment. 
The MAH concluded that no new safety concerns were identified in the VIO study that had not been 
reported  in  other  placebo-controlled  trials.  Both  the  causes  and  the  overall  incidence  of  death  have 
been thoroughly evaluated. The deaths in the VIO verteporfin group are from a variety of causes and 
have  no  temporal  relationship  to  treatment.  Therefore,  the  deaths  in  the  VIO  verteporfin  group  are 
considered by the MAH to be not related to treatment. Moreover, pre-existing risk factors explain the 
deaths in the majority of cases. The incidence of deaths in the VIO verteporfin group was compared to 
those  found  in  the  Visudyne  and  placebo  groups  from  previous  registration  trials.  The  verteporfin 
group death rate in VIO (4.1%) is lower than the placebo group death rate in TAP (4.3%) and within 
the range of, if not lower than, the death rates expected for this age group based on US epidemiologic 
data.  This  is  true  for  both  overall  causes  and  by  the  individual  body  system  causes  of  death.  In 
contrast,  the  death  rate  in  the  VIO  placebo  group  (0.8%)  is  low  and  is  the  outlier  compared  with 
previous  registration  trials  and  epidemiologic  data  for  this  age  group.  The  larger  variation  of  the 
placebo group death rates (0.8 - 4.3%) compared with the verteporfin group death rates (1.8 - 4.1%) is 
not  unexpected  since  the  placebo  groups  had  fewer  patients  due  to  the  2:1  (verteporfin:placebo) 
randomization in all of these trials. The deaths were all from systemic causes, and the MAH believed 
to have demonstrated that the death rates for patients with occult CNV and classic-containing CNV are 
not  different,  which  validates  combining  all  randomized  placebo-controlled  trials  of  verteporfin  in 
AMD patients to determine the overall true incidence of deaths. 
The  percentage  of  verteporfin-  and  placebo-treated  patients  in  VIO  with  at  least  one  adverse  event 
(both overall and in the study eye) was lower than in previous registration studies. 
Although the percentage of discontinuations due to adverse events was higher in VIO than in previous 
trials  (likely  due  to  older  age  in  VIO),  this  was  true  in  both  verteporfin  and  placebo  groups,  with  a

higher proportion of discontinuations in the VIO placebo group compared with the placebo groups of 
TAP A+B and VIP AMD than in the VIO verteporfin group compared with the verteporfin groups of 
TAP A+B and VIP AMD. Moreover, these discontinuations were due to conditions expected within 
the AMD age group studied. The 4 patients (1.6%) in the VIO study who discontinued due to adverse 
events associated with verteporfin all discontinued due to infusion-related back pain, an adverse event 
that is transient and well described in the SPC. 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  in  VIO  was  better  than  or  similar  to  that  demonstrated  in  the  previous 
registration studies, VIP AMD and TAP. These data, along with the MAH's analysis of deaths in the 
VIO study, led us to the VIO study conclusion that Visudyne therapy in the treatment of occult with 
no classic CNV lesions was safe and well tolerated. 
With respect to efficacy, although VIO failed to achieve a statistically significant difference between 
verteporfin and placebo groups in the primary efficacy parameter at Month 24, the verteporfin group 
had better outcomes for all variables at Months 12 and 24. In the 3 studies that included occult with no 
classic lesions (TAP, VIP and VIO), verteporfin treatment benefit has always been observed, but the 
magnitude  of  this  benefit  has  varied.  The  greatest  benefit  was  observed  in  the  TAP  studies  and  the 
least benefit in the VIO study. On this basis, the VIO study visual acuity results do not contradict the 
benefit observed for the occult CNV AMD subtype in previous registration studies.  
The MAH concluded that 
− the results of VIO are consistent with the previous data which supported a positive opinion of the 
CHMP for this indication on 30 May 2002; 
− the benefit-risk profile remains unchanged for the occult indication. 
Therefore the MAH were of the opinion that this indication should be maintained and requested the 
CHMP to reconsider its recommendation. 
With regards to the SPC, a small discrepancy was noted in the indication wording between the SPC 
section 4.1 (referring to “age-related macular degeneration”) and the PL (referring to the “wet form of 
age-related macular degeneration” in section 1). Therefore the MAH proposed to align the SPC 4.1 on 
the PL by adding text in bold as follows: 
“Visudyne  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  exudative  (wet)  age-related  macular 
degeneration (AMD)” […] 
CHMP conclusions 
The CHMP considered that no new data were provided by the MAH in their answer to the request for 
supplementary information dated 29 March 2007.  
From an efficacy viewpoint, the VIO study, which aimed at confirming the  disputable positive results 
of VIP AMD, has failed to show statistically significant results,  although the population having had 
the best results in the VIP AMD trial, has been recruited in VIO. The pooled results of three studies 
having  recruiting  patients  with  occult  and  no  classic  lesions  are  debatable  from  a  methodological 
viewpoint: pooling one “positive” and one negative study is usually not allowed, and the number of 
patients with lesions having been recruited in TAP is too small to allow any favourable interpretation. 
From  a  safety  viewpoint,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  excess  of  deaths  observed  in  the  VIO  study  is 
probably due to chance, for the reasons outlined by the MAH.   
Following  the  evaluation  of  the  dossier  and  the  responses  submitted  by  the  MAH  in  the  request  for 
Supplementary  Information,,  overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that,  essentially  due  to  concerns  over 
efficacy, the benefit/risk balance in the occult indication was negative. The MAH was asked to present 
in  an  oral  explanation  over  the  risk/benefit  of  Visudyne  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal 
occult CNV due to AMD with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression.

Further  to  the  oral  explanation,  the  CHMP  still  considered  the  risk/benefit  of  Visudyne  in  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal  occult  CNV  due  to  AMD  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing 
disease progression to be negative. 
2.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
In  essence,  the  position  of  the  CHMP  after  assessment  of  FUM  014.1  was  that  the  favourable 
benefit/risk of Visudyne in AMD patient population who have occult subfoveal CNV with evidence of 
recent  or  ongoing  disease  progression  previously  seen  in  VIP  study  had  not  been  replicated  in  VIO 
study, which was a confirmatory study requested as Follow-Up Measure. Therefore, the results merit 
to be taken into account, and should be balanced with the benefit of Visudyne in this specific study. 
The MAH agreed on the fact that the SPC should reflect the results of the studies for the occult patient 
population.  However,  rather  than  amending  Section  4.1,  they  proposed  that  it  would  be  more 
appropriate  to  deal  with  the  issue  in  Section  5.1  only.  This  approach  would  allow  combining  the 
proposed  statement  with  the  explanation  that  appears  in  Section  5.1,  which  in  the  MAH’s  opinion 
ensures  correct  and  thorough  understanding.  Furthermore,  physicians  are  already  cross-referred  and 
directed to Section 5.1 in the indication statement for occult CNV, so they will turn to that section for 
necessary information.  
In contrast with the MAH’s view, the CHMP continued to believe that the negative results of VIO-013 
are of importance and that the lack of 24 month efficacy results of Visudyne therapy in patients with 
occult AMD should be clearly reflected in the SPC. 
This  indication  was  granted  on  rather  weak  efficacy  data  from  the  VIP-003  study.  Therefore,  a 
confirmatory  study  was  requested  (i.e.  VIO-013)  by  the  CHMP.  The  study  results  have  failed  to 
support  the  previous  VIP-003  results.  In  addition,  an  unfavourable  and  unexplained  adverse  event 
profile mainly related to deaths (Visudyne group: 10, 4.1%; placebo group: 1, 0.8%) was observed in 
the  confirmatory  VIO-013  study.  Therefore,  the  overall  risk  /  benefit  of  Visudyne  in  patients  with 
occult CNV is not considered favourable. 
Based  on  these  considerations,  the  CHMP,  in  March  2007  recommended  to  delete  the  indication  in 
patients with occult subfoveal CNV from Section 4.1 and to add new wording to Section 5.1, as in the 
box below: 
Section 4.1: 
“Visudyne is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with 
  - predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation, 
  -  occult  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation  (CNV)  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing  disease 
progression. (see section 5.1). 
or 
patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia.” 
Section 5.1:  
Add  the  sentence  “The  benefit  of  the  product  in  AMD  patients  with  occult  subfoveal  CNV  with 
evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression have not been consistently shown” 
The  MAH  accepted  the  CHMP's  recommendation  for  amending  Section  5.1  of  their  originally 
submitted SPC. They proposed, however, a number of other changes to this section.  
In summary, the CHMP considered that the MAH new proposal for Section 5.1 was to be shortened. It 
was agreed that the description of a similar design for both VIP and VIO studies could be grouped. 
However,  it  is  important  to  describe  both  studies  in  “occult”  and  present  their  results  in  separate 
paragraphs.  The  objective  is  to  clarify  and  to  follow  the  chronological  order  of  results  for  these 
studies. Therefore, the CHMP recommended modifying the description (see below).

Moreover,  in  line  with  the  recommendation  discussed  for  section  4.1  (deletion  of  the  indication  in 
patients with occult CNV), the CHMP recommends introducing a wording related to the inconsistency 
of  the  results  in  occult  lesions,  at  the  beginning  of  section  5.1:  “The  benefit  of  the  product  in  AMD 
patients  with  occult  subfoveal  CNV  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing  disease  progression  has  not 
been consistently shown” 
For the full CHMP recommendation for section 5.1 please refer to section 3.5.1 below:

Therapeutic indications 
The following amendments are recommended by the CHMP for the SPC: 
“Visudyne is indicated for the treatment of 
patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with 
  - predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation, 
  -  occult  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation  (CNV)  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing  disease 
progression. (see section 5.1). 
or 
patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation secondary to pathological myopia.” 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
No change is considered anymore to be required for Section 4.2 of the SPC. 
“It is reminded that occurrence of signs of atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium should lead to 
discontinuation of Visudyne therapy.”
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
The CHMP recommendation for section 5.1 is the following (text in the box): 
Age-related Macular Degeneration with occult with no classic lesions 
The  benefit  of  the  product  in  the  AMD  patient  population  who  have  occult  subfoveal  CNV  with 
evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression has not been demonstrated consistently. 
Two  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-masked,  multicentre,  24-month  studies  (BPD  OCR  003 
AMD, or Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy-AMD [VIP-AMD], and BPD OCR 013, or Visudyne in 
Occult Choroidal Neovascularization [VIO]) were conducted in patients with AMD characterised by 
occult with no classic subfoveal CNV.  
The VIO study included patients with occult with no classic subfoveal CNV with a visual acuity score 
of 73 34 letters (20/40-20/200), and patients with lesions >4 MPS disc areas were to have baseline 
visual acuity <65 letters (<20/50). 364 patients (244 verteporfin, 120 placebo) were enrolled in this 
study.  The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  same  as  in  TAP  (see  above),  with  an  additional 
endpoint of month 24 defined. Another efficacy parameter was also defined: the proportion of patients 
who  lost  less  than 30  letters  (equivalent  to  6  lines) of  visual  acuity  at  months  12  and  24  relative  to 
baseline. The study did not show statistically significant results on the primary efficacy parameter at 
month  12  (15-letter  responder  rate  62.7%  versus  55.0%,  p=0.150;  30-letter  responder  rate  84.0% 
versus 83.3%, p=0.868) or at month 24 (15-letter responder rate 53.3% versus 47.5%, p=0.300; 30-
letter  responder  rate  77.5%  versus  75.0%,  p=0.602).  A  higher  percentage  of  patients  who  received 
Visudyne,  compared  with  those  who  received  placebo,  experienced  adverse  events  (88.1%  versus 
81.7%),  associated  adverse  events  (23.0%  versus  7.5%),  events  leading  to  discontinuation  (11.9% 
versus 3.3%) and events leading to death (n=10 [4.1%] versus n=1 [0.8%]). No death was considered 
to be related to treatment. 
The VIP-AMD included patients with occult with no classic subfoveal CNV with a visual acuity score 
of >50 letters (20/100). This study also included patients with classic containing CNV with a visual 
18/20

acuity  score  >70  letters  (20/40).  339  patients  (225  verteporfin,  114  placebo)  were  enrolled  in  this 
study. The efficacy parameter was the same as in TAP and VIO (see above). At month 12, the study did 
not  show  statistically  significant  results  on  the  primary  efficacy  parameter  (responder  rate  49.3% 
versus  45.6%,  p=0.517).  At  month  24,  a  statistically  significant  difference  of  12.9%  in  favour  of 
Visudyne compared to placebo was observed (46.2% versus 33.3%, p=0.023). A group of patients who 
had  occult  with  no  classic  lesions  (n=258)  showed  a  statistically  significant  difference  of  13.7%  in 
favour  of  Visudyne  compared  to  placebo  (45.2%  versus  31.5%,  p=0.032).  A  higher  percentage  of 
patients  who  received  Visudyne,  compared  with  those  who  received  placebo,  experienced  adverse 
events (89.3% versus 82.5%), associated adverse events (42.7% versus 18.4%) and events leading to 
discontinuation  (6.2%  versus  0.9%).  A  lower  percentage  of  Visudyne  patients  had  events  leading  to 
death (n=4 [1.8%] versus n=3 [2.6%]); no death was considered to be related to treatment. 
3.5.2  Additional changes 
In addition to the changes in relation to 24 month VIO results discussed in detail above, the MAH took 
the  opportunity  with  this  variation  application  to  propose  a  number  of  other  changes  in  order  to 
improve  the  reading  and  understanding  of  the  Visudyne  SPC,  leaflet  and  labelling.  The  CHMP 
considered these changes acceptable, with the following exceptions: 
-SPC, Section 4.4: “There are no clinical data to support a concomitant treatment of the second eye”. 
The MAH proposed to replace ‘concomitant’ with ‘same-day’. The MAH proposal is confusing and 
not well understood. 
-SPC, Section 5.1: It seems unnecessary to weigh the text with the complete title of studies TAP, VIP 
or VIO. The full name of the study should be replaced by the abbreviated acronyms.  
-PL  introduction:  “If  you  have  any  further  questions,  ask  your  doctor  or  pharmacist”.  The  MAH 
proposed replacing “Pharmacist” by “Nurse”. The CHMP agrees for the sentence to read “If you have 
any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse”. 
-PL Section 4: The MAH suggests replacing “Hypersensitivity” by “increased sensitivity”: not agreed 
by CHMP, as the change may lead to potential ambiguity. 
It  is  noted  that  MAH  introduces  Bulgaria  and  Romania  in  the  list  of  the  local  representatives  in 
Section 6 of the Package Leaflet. 
3.6  Benefit / Risk Assessment 
The 2-year VIO results failed to support the 2-year results of the VIP study: no statistically significant 
differences  in  the  primary efficacy parameters  between  verteporfin  and placebo  were  observed  at  2-
year  (5.8%  for  patients  losing  <15  letters  (p=0.2998)  and  2.5%  for  patients  losing  <30  letters 
(p=0.6022).  
The  confirmatory  VIO  study  failed  to  support  the  efficacy  of  the  use  of  Visudyne  in  patients  with 
AMD with occult CNV seen in study VIP. 
Following  the  evaluation  of  the  dossier  and  the  responses  submitted  by  the  MAH  in  the  request  for 
Supplementary  Information,  overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that,  due  to  concerns  over  efficacy,  the 
benefit/risk balance in the occult indication was negative. The MAH was asked to present in an oral 
explanation over the risk/benefit of Visudyne in the treatment of patients with subfoveal occult CNV 
due to AMD with evidence of recent or ongoing disease progression. 
19/20

Further  to  the  oral  explanation,  the  CHMP  still  considered  the  risk/benefit  of  Visudyne  in  the 
treatment  of  patients  with  subfoveal  occult  CNV  due  to  AMD  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing 
disease progression to be negative. 
Therefore, the CHMP recommends the deletion of the indication in patients with age-related macular 
degeneration  with  occult  subfoveal  choroidal  neovascularisation  with  evidence  of  recent  or  ongoing 
disease progression.  
A DHCP letter to inform practitioners of the outcome of the VIO study and the deletion of the occult 
indication has been submitted by the MAH on 25 April 2007. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
On  26  April  2007  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Labelling  and  Package 
Leaflet.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pregabalin, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
In view of the available data on suicidal ideation following withdrawal of pregabalin from spontaneous 
case reports describing a close temporal relationship between the withdrawal of pregabalin and the 
onset of suicidal ideation either with or without other withdrawal symptoms, including one case with a 
pos. rechallenge, the PRAC considers a causal relationship between pregabalin and suicidal ideation 
after pregabalin withdrawal to be probable and concluded that the product information of products 
containing pregabalin should be amended accordingly.   
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pregabalin the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pregabalin is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

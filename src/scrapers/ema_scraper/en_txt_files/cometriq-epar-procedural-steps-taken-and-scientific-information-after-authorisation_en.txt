Based on safety data collected in the post-marketing 
embolism arterial to the list of adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with frequency Uncommon based 
on literature search. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
setting, section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to add 
embolism arterial with frequency Uncommon to the list of 
ADRs. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

to amend an existing warning on hypertension and

literature review and post-marketing and clinical

addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been 
observed with cabozantinib. Blood pressure should be well-
controlled prior to initiating cabozantinib. After cabozantinib 
initiation blood pressure should be monitored early and 
regularly and treated as needed with appropriate anti-
hypertensive therapy. In the case of persistent 
hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensives, the 
cabozantinib treatment should be interrupted until blood 
pressure is controlled, after which cabozantinib can be 
resumed at a reduced dose. Cabozantinib should be 
discontinued if hypertension is severe and persistent 
despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose reduction of 
cabozantinib. In case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib 
should be discontinued.

prescribers to the most frequently reported type of 
venous thrombosis. Changes to the frequency 
categorisation of some ADRs are also proposed 
based on new pooled data. The Package Leaflet is

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
COMETRIQ is 140 mg once daily, taken as one 80 mg 
orange capsule and three 20 mg grey capsules. Treatment 
should continue until the patient is no longer clinically 
benefiting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity 
occurs. It should be expected that a majority of patients 
treated with COMETRIQ will require one or more dose 
adjustments (reduction and/or interruption) due to toxicity. 
Patients should therefore be closely monitored during the 
first eight weeks of therapy 
Events of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary 
embolism and events of arterial thromboembolism, 
sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. 
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients who 
are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who 
develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other 
clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication. 
Severe haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed 
with cabozantinib. Patients who have evidence of 
involvement of the trachea or bronchi by tumour or a 
history of haemoptysis prior to treatment initiation should 
be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib 
therapy. Cabozantinib should not be administered to 
patients with serious haemorrhage or recent haemoptysis. 
Diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and 
stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most commonly 
reported GI adverse reactions. Prompt medical 
management, including supportive care with antiemetics, 
antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent 
dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and weight loss. Dose 
interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of 
cabozantinib should be considered in case of persistent or 
Page 10/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recurrent significant GI adverse reactions. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has 
been observed with cabozantinib. PRES should be 
considered in any patient presenting with symptoms 
suggestive of the diagnosis, including seizures, headache, 
visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. 
Cabozantinib treatment should be discontinued in patients 
with PRES.

having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for Cometriq, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the Opinion.

indicating that in cases of mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment the recommended dose of cabozantinib needs 
to be lower than recommended 140 mg (60 mg once daily),

cabozantinib should be used with caution. The medicine is 
not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic

clinical studies evaluating the enterohepatic recirculation, 
excretion and metabolite profiles of cabozantinib. Based on 
the results the SmPC has been updated to reflect possibility 
of drug-drug interactions of cabozantinib and bile salt-
sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and 
cholestagel. Such agents may impact absorption (or 
reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure. 
The clinical significance of these potential interactions is 
unknown.

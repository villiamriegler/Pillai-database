adaptive, single-dose study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolite(s) 
in subjects with normal hepatic function and hepatic 
impairment”, listed as a category 3 study in the RMP, 
and on safety data from postmarketing and clinical 
trials experience. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 8.0 have also been updated. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to submit Minor Linguistic 
Amendments (MLA) for Veklury. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. No new safety 
concerns or hepatoxicity were identified in patients with 
chronic liver disease. Participants with normal hepatic 
function and moderate or severe hepatic impairment did 
not reveal any new safety concerns. The recommendation 
for prothrombin time monitoring is deleted from section 4.8 
of the SmPC as there has been no correlation with clinical 
consequences seen in the placebo controlled COVID-19 
clinical trials.

impairment were not available. Only patients with mild to 
moderate renal impairment were included in the Phase 3 
clinical development program and received remdesivir 
without dose adjustment. Thus, remdesivir was not 
recommended for use in patients with severe renal 
impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min). 
Based on newly provided results from studies GS-US-540-
9015 and GS-US-540-5912, it was concluded that no dose 
adjustment of remdesivir or change in treatment duration 
is required in patients with renal impairment, including 
those on dialysis. However, patients with severe renal 
impairment and end-stage renal disease should be closely 
monitored for adverse events during treatment with 
remdesivir. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC in order to change posology recommendations 
for patients with renal impairment, update an 
existing warning on renal impairment and update the 
safety and efficacy information based on final results 
from studies GS-US-540-5912 and GS-US-540-9015, 
listed as category 3 studies in the RMP. Study GS-
US-540-5912 is a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir in 
participants with severely reduced kidney function 
who were hospitalised for COVID-19, while study GS-
US-540-9015 is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, 
single-dose study to evaluate the single-dose PK of 
remdesivir in participants with normal and impaired 
renal function. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The RMP version 6.0 has also been 
submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity 
to introduce minor edits to the PI.

(NIAID) to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of 
remdesivir (RDV) in pregnant and non-pregnant women of 
childbearing potential treated for COVID-19 ). In addition, 
the MAH submitted data from post-marketing experience 
(third pregnancy safety report) to justify new 
recommendation for RDV use in pregnant women. 
Based on the submitted data no clinically relevant 
differences in the pharmacokinetics of RDV and its 
metabolites were observed between pregnant and non-
pregnant women and no dose adjustment is needed. 
With respect to clinical safety, limited data is available from 
RDV use during pregnancy (198 cases with known 
pregnancy outcome), in particular, during first trimester of 
pregnancy (12 cases with known pregnancy outcome). 
Consequently, RDV use during the first trimester of 
pregnancy cannot be recommended. On the other hand, 
use in second and third trimester of pregnancy may be 
considered in individual patients as it is well known that 
symptomatic COVID-19 during pregnancy is accompanied 
with worse clinical course of the disease, increased risk for 
ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death in 
comparison with symptomatic nonpregnant females of 
reproductive age and available data from RDV use during 
2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy do not indicate any 
risk.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with nonclinical 
results following final study reports addressing the 
activity of remdesivir in additional cell lines and 
chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine antagonism 
(fulfilment of 3 components of the Specific Obligation 
SOB 012 from EMEA/H/C/005622/R/0015). In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to submit the interim results of 
the non-clinical studies related to the 
characterisation of clinical isolates and/or 
recombinant viruses with P323L, A97V, and A547V 
substitutions.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
remdesivir on RdRp/Nsp12 A97V, P323L, and D484Y 
mutants indicates that these recombinant mutants are still 
susceptible to remdesivir as no significant change in EC50 
values was found. 
Secondly, the antiviral activity of remdesivir against a 
nanoluciferase-expressing SARS-CoV-2 construct in a 
human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 expressing the 
human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2) show inhibition of in 
vitro replication with an EC50 value of 0.115 μM in this 
human alveolar cell line. The results are consistent with the 
results achieved in other cell types and thereby confirm the 
in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2. 
Finally, the in vitro studies show that co-incubation of 
remdesivir with Chloroquine (CQ) or Hydroxychloroquine 
(HCQ) results in a reduced formation of RDV-TP in various 
cell types. This observed reductions in RDV-TP in the 
presence of CQ or HCQ indicates a potential antagonistic 
effect on remdesivir metabolism to its active triphosphate.

SmPC new text 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties / Antiviral Activity 
of the SmPC is being updated to include new data on the 
antiviral activity of remdesivir in a human alveolar epithelial 
cell line (A549-hACE2). The results are consistent with the 
results achieved in other cell types and thereby confirm the 
in vitro antiviral activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2.

the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
and PL 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and

renewal of the conditional MA for Veklury, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the opinion. 
Within this procedure and update on sections 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 
of the SmPC  has been done to mainly reflect  the update in 
the frequency of anaphylaxis as not know and the

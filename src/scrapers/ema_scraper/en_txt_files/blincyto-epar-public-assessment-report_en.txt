2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a malignant proliferation of lymphoid cells blocked at early 
stage of differentiation. ALL originates from the expansion of a single abnormal lymphoid progenitor 
cell, which accumulates mutations that lead to unregulated proliferation. In addition to the genetic 
predisposition, the main recognized environmental factor for ALL is exposure to radiation, but also 
exposure to chemical agents (i.e. benzene) has been associated with an increased risk of ALL; 
nonetheless, the aetiology of most ALL cases remains unknown. 
ALL represents about 15% of adult and 80% of paediatric leukaemia affecting all ages with two 
incidence peaks. One is in late adulthood and one in children aged 2 to 5 years. Approximately 6,020 
new cases are diagnosed in the US each year (Siegel et al, 2014). Of these new diagnoses, about only 
2,400 occur among adults (Howlader et al, 2014). In the European Union (EU), more than 7,200 new 
cases are diagnosed annually (Gatta et al, 2011) with approximately 40% (roughly 3,000 diagnoses) 
occurring in adults (Inaba et al, 2013). 
There are several subgroups of ALL, which are mainly defined by immunophenotyping, cytogenetics 
and molecular genetics. These have been grouped into further subtypes, which may correspond to 
different levels of maturation into normal B cell development. The distinctions of therapeutic 
importance are B cell precursor ALL (including early B-precursor, B-precursor, and transitional B-
precursor ALL), mature B cell ALL, and T cell ALL. The most common B-lineage ALL is the B-precursor 
phenotype (~85%) with B cell markers such as CD19 (early B-precursor).  
ALL is a heterogeneous disease with distinct biologic and prognostic groupings. Age, MRD status, and 
initial response to chemotherapy are relevant prognostic factors in ALL. Patients with higher age have 
a significantly poorer outcome than younger patients. They are treated with less intense chemotherapy 
and are rarely candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients with 
initial treatment failure have an extremely unfavourable prognosis (Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011; Oriol 
et al, 2010; Bassan et al, 2009; Goldstone et al, 2008; Fielding et al, 2007). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 9/124 
 
 
 
 
 
In ALL, leukemic cells accumulate in the bone marrow ultimately replacing most normal hematopoietic 
cells. This results in bone marrow failure and its clinical manifestations such as anaemia, haemorrhage 
and infections.  
The choice of chemotherapeutic agents depends on several factors, including response to previous 
treatments and duration of remission (i.e., early or late relapse). Vincristine sulfate is approved in the 
US as single-agent therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. In 2006 Clofarabine (Evoltra, for the treatment of ALL in 
paediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory after receiving at least two prior regimens and 
where there is no other treatment option anticipated to result in a durable response) and dasatinib 
(Sprycel, for Ph+ ALL adult patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy) were approved in 
EU. Nelarabine (Atriance) was approved in 2007 for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) that has not responded to or has 
relapsed following treatment with at least two chemotherapy regimens. Mercaptopurine (Xaluprine) 
was authorised in 2012 for the treatment of ALL in adults, adolescents and children. For imatinib 
(Glivec) an extension of indication was approved in 2013 for the treatment of paediatric patients with 
newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ALL) integrated 
with chemotherapy. Ponatinib (Iclusig) was approved in 2013 in Ph+ ALL adult patients who are 
resistant or intolerant to dasatinib, and for whom subsequent treatment with imatinib is not clinically 
appropriate, or who have the T315I mutation. 
The treatments, accompanied by severe side effects, often results in clinical remission. However, for 
many patients ALL remains a fulminate and incurable fatal disease due to its high rate of relapse. 
Contrary to childhood ALL, in which OS is more than 80% at 5 years, therapeutic progress has been 
slow in adult ALL, with an average survival of 35% in patients aged 18 to 60 years (Bassan and 
Hoelzer, 2011; Pui et al, 2008). Approximately 10% of patients are refractory to current multi-agent 
chemotherapy treatment regimens. Up to 90% of newly diagnosed patients with adult ALL will achieve 
an initial CR; however, up to 50% of patients will experience relapse and need a second line of 
therapy, also referred to as first salvage therapy (Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2009; Thomas et al, 1999). 
Patients who relapse a second time have a median OS of no more than 3 months (O’Brien et al, 2008). 
Primary refractory ALL is defined by absence of CR after standard induction therapy. A patient has 
relapsed ALL, if this patient has achieved a CR during upfront therapy and has then relapsed during, or 
after continuation of therapy. A similar classification is applicable for salvage therapy. Refractory 
relapse is defined by lack of CR after first salvage therapy. Second relapse or later relapses are defined 
as relapse after CR in first salvage or later salvage therapies. For patients at lower age, refractory 
disease or early relapse during upfront treatment, on one hand, compared with late relapse after 
upfront treatment or during maintenance therapy on the other hand, are important factors for 
treatment selection. In the former group of patients, experimental drug combinations have been used, 
whereas in the latter repeated induction therapy is the treatment of choice. In patients with relapse 
after allogeneic HSCT less intensive treatments may be preferable. In patients with relapse during 
intensive chemotherapy, it is of no use to repeat administration of the same regimens (Gökbuget and 
Hoelzer 2010). 
In the relapsed/refractory adult population, the goal of therapy is to induce remission and proceed to 
allogeneic HSCT, which is the only potentially curative option in adult patients with relapsed/refractory 
B precursor ALL (Hahn et al, 2006; Fielding et al, 2007), or to obtain long-term disease free survival 
and increase OS, if HSCT is not an option.

About the product 
Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct that binds specifically to CD19 
expressed on the surface of cells of B-lineage origin and CD3 expressed on the surface of T-cells. It 
activates endogenous T-cells by connecting CD3 in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex with CD19 on 
benign and malignant B-cells. The anti-tumour activity of blinatumomab immunotherapy is not 
dependent on T-cells bearing a specific TCR or on peptide antigens presented by cancer cells, but is 
polyclonal in nature and independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on target cells. 
Blinatumomab mediates the formation of a cytolytic synapse between the T-cell and the tumour cell, 
releasing proteolytic enzymes to kill both proliferating and resting target cells. Blinatumomab is 
associated with transient upregulation of cell adhesion molecules, production of cytolytic proteins, 
release of inflammatory cytokines, and proliferation of T-cells, and results in elimination of CD19+ cells 
(see SmPC, section 5.1). 
The sponsor applied for the following indication: “BLINCYTO is indicated for the treatment of adults 
with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL)” which has been recommended by the CHMP. 
Patients may receive 2 cycles of treatment. A single cycle of treatment is 4 weeks of continuous 
infusion. Each cycle of treatment is separated by a 2 week treatment-free interval. Patients who have 
achieved complete remission (CR/CRh*) after 2 treatment cycles may receive up to 3 additional cycles 
of BLINCYTO consolidation treatment, based on an individual benefits-risks assessment (see SmPC, 
section 4.2). 
Hospitalisation is recommended for initiation at a minimum for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the 
first 2 days of the second cycle (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
BLINCYTO finished product is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized white to off white powder for 
reconstitution (powder for concentrate for solution for infusion), containing 38.5 mcg blinatumomab 
per 4mL vial. Blinatumomab is provided with a separate vial of a sterile solution stabilizer (solution for 
solution for infusion), a product-specific mixture containing citric acid monohydrate, lysine 
hydrochloride, polysorbate 80 and sodium hydroxide, pH 7.0. The solution stabilizer prevents 
adsorption of blinatumomab to surfaces of administration materials. Blinatumomab is administered by 
continuous intravenous administration. To prepare blinatumomab for infusion, appropriate amount of 
the solution stabilizer is added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% sodium chloride at a 1:50 dilution. 
The finished product powder is then reconstituted with sterile water for injections (3.0 mL, provided by 
the admixing pharmacy) and the appropriate amount is transferred to the infusion bag.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The general information provided on nomenclature, structure and general properties of the active 
substance, blinatumomab, is considered satisfactory. Blinatumomab was developed by genetic 
engineering from two distinct parental murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs): HD37, which recognizes 
the pan-B-cell antigen CD19; and L2K-07, which specifically binds the T-cell receptor-associated 
complex, CD3. The single-chain variable fragments from each of these antibodies are linked via a short 
inter-domain linker peptide composed of glycine and serine amino acids, yielding the full length 504 
amino acid protein. A schematic highlighting the derivation of blinatumomab from the independent 
murine monoclonal antibodies and its mode of action is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1: Derivation of Blinatumomab from Distinct Parental Antibodies 
The CD19 binding N-terminal domain contains 4 cysteine residues that are involved in intramolecular 
disulfide bonds. The CD3 binding C-terminal domain contains 5 cysteins residues of which 4 are 
involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds. The C-terminal also contains an engineered hexahistidine 
sequence (6X-His) to enable purification with zinc-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). 
Blinatumomab does not contain the N-linked glycosylation sequon and is aglycosylated. The theoretical 
amino acid sequence of blinatumomab is provided. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturer 
Blinatumomab active substance is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing 
Practices (cGMP).  
Manufacturing process 
The description of the active substance manufacturing process and process controls/tests is 
appropriately detailed and starts with the expansion (into flasks, roller bottles and bag bioreactors) of 
one vial of working cell bank (WCB) of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, which is used to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 12/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inoculate the main fermenter. One vial of working cell bank leads to a single batch of active substance, 
without cycling or generation of sub-lots. The harvest is collected by centrifugation followed by 
filtration steps to remove cells and cellular debris. The purification process includes three 
chromatography steps, two concentration/diafiltration steps and two virus removal/inactivation steps. 
The active substance is filtered, dispensed and stored at 2-8°C.  No reprocessing is claimed.  
Control of materials 
Raw materials 
A listing of raw materials, including filters, membranes and disposable containers, used in the 
manufacturing process is presented. Raw materials are tested according to European pharmacopoeia 
(where available), or according to in-house monographs. No material of animal origin is used in the 
blinatumomab manufacturing process and sufficient information on analysis of biological origin used in 
establishment of cell substrate has been provided. 
Expression construct and cell banking 
The cell substrate was derived from the parental Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The highest 
producing monoclonal cell was selected to generate cell banking system. The Applicant has adequately 
described the source history and generation of the cell substrate and cell line development.  
A two-tiered cell banking system, with a WCB derived from the Master Cell Bank (MCB) has been 
established. Cell banks were tested and characterized in accordance with ICH guideline requirements 
and were both confirmed to be of CHO origin. The expression of the expected cDNA sequence was 
confirmed. The genetic stability of the production cell line has been investigated and a limit of in vitro 
cell age was set.   
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
In-process controls have been classified into three categories according as they relate to 
process/product impurities, safety/microbial control or process consistency. Cell culture process is 
controlled by in-process controls that evaluate process consistency (e.g. viability) while harvest and 
purification process are mainly controlled by product/process related impurity parameters (e.g. 
aggregate, host cell proteins (HCP)) and safety parameters (e.g. bioburden, viruses).  
Process validation 
Process validation consisted in the analysis of data derived from three consecutive full-scale lots of 
blinatumomab. Evaluation of process performance parameters demonstrates that the proposed 
manufacturing process is consistent. Removal of key impurities as well as microbial control, were 
satisfactorily addressed throughout the process. In-process pool hold times and the lifetime of columns 
were appropriately evaluated and may be extended through additional validation.  
Manufacturing process development 
Six manufacturing processes have been used throughout the process development history. The 
comparability exercise compared three batches from commercial process vs ten batches from clinical 
processes. The comparison included a combination of specification and characterisation testing, as well 
as an assessment of the stability profiles under accelerated and forced degradation conditions. The 
results provided do not show any significant differences for the parameters tested. Some concerns

were raised related to analytical comparability strategy and statistical tools. The responses provided by 
the Applicant are satisfactory. The batches derived from commercial process can be considered as 
representative of the batches used in the completed clinical trials.  
The Applicant proposes an integrated control strategy approach based on quality risk management 
principles. Criticality of each quality attribute was assessed and process characterisation studies, 
including risk analysis and targeted experimentation, were conducted to increase process 
understanding and assess the effects of operational parameters on the quality attributes. Operational 
and in-process testing controls, as well as final testing, were then established to define an appropriate 
control strategy. The overall control strategy proposed by the Applicant is endorsed. 
Characterisation 
The structure of blinatumomab was elucidated from a variety of biological, biochemical, and 
biophysical techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structure and functional 
properties and assessment of critical quality attributes.  
Blinatumomab binds specifically to CD3 and CD19 and fails to recognize other T-cell and B-cell specific 
receptors. The mechanism of action of blinatumomab is to cross-link CD19 located on the tumour cell 
with CD3 on the surface of the T cell, resulting in lysis of the tumour cell. Multiple cell-based 
cytotoxicity assays, a CD3 binding assay, and a CD19 competitive binding assay were used in the 
biological characterization of blinatumomab. 
Most of variants in blinatumomab active substance are classified as product-related substances. The 
product-related species classified as impurities are low and routinely controlled by the manufacturing 
process. Their removal was appropriately evaluated and their residual amounts are considered 
acceptable.  
Specification 
The proposed active substance specification is in line with ICH Q6B and complies with the monograph 
on monoclonal antibodies for human use. The selection of tests to be part of the active substance 
batch release includes potency assay, and methods to control for product-related substances (charge 
variants), product-related impurities (aggregates). HCP and DNA will be monitored during the 
manufacturing process as routine in-process pool testing.  
Validation of the methods, as well as acceptance criteria and their justification, raised some issues 
which were largely clarified in the response package. It is noted that the Applicant will re-evaluate the 
active substance acceptance criteria when further data are available (15 lots minimum). 
Reference materials 
Reference standards used for the routine testing of blinatumomab active substance have been 
prepared from lyophilized finished product. The use of a reference standard derived from finished 
product is deemed appropriate on the basis that the formulations of active substance and finished 
product are identical. Finished product is a lyophilizate of active substance, and based on analytical 
data generated to date, the product characteristics remain unchanged.

Container closure system  
The choice of the container closure system has been justified and is in line with current pharmaceutical 
standards for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Upon request the Applicant provided the full data and 
risk assessment performed to evaluate extractables toxicity. Results demonstrated that no leachable 
compounds are anticipated to pose a safety risk for the administration blinatomumab as directed. 
Finally, the container closure system integrity has likewise satisfactorily been demonstrated.  
Stability 
The Applicant claims a 2-year shelf-life at 2-8°C. This claim is based on the data obtained from three 
batches using the commercial process and two batches produced using process 5. The provided data 
supports the claimed shelf-life.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Composition 
The finished product is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. The powder is 
contained in a 4mL vial (type I glass) containing 38.5 µg blinatumomab per vial formulated in citric 
acid monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate, lysine hydrochloride, polysorbate 80 and sodium hydroxide to 
pH7.0. For administration, the powder is reconstituted with 3 mL of sterile water for injections (not 
provided) and appropriate volume is thereafter added aseptically to an IV infusion bag containing 
normal 0.9% (w/v) saline solution (not provided) that has been prepared with appropriate amounts of 
an IV solution stabilizer (provided in a 10mL vial) to prevent adsorption of blinatumomab to surfaces of 
administration materials. 
Pharmaceutical development  
The finished product formulation evolved from a liquid formulation to a lyophilized formulation. No 
overage or overfill is claimed. Six manufacturing processes have been used to produce blinatumomab 
finished product. The batches derived from the commercial process are used in on-going clinical trials. 
A comparability exercise has been performed between historical batches and commercial batches. 
Three commercial batches were compared to up to 9 historical batches as regards the specification 
testing, biophysical and biochemical characterization, and stability profiles under accelerated stability 
and forced degradation conditions. Questions were raised related to the representativeness of the 
historical clinical lots with respect to the commercial batches. The responses provided by the Applicant 
are satisfactory and the commercial batches can be considered as representative of the batches used 
in the completed clinical trials.  
As for active substance, quality risk management principles were applied to define the control strategy 
of finished product. When necessary, process characterization studies were conducted to better 
understand the process and support definition of the proposed manufacturing process and controls. 
The overall control strategy proposed by the Applicant is endorsed. 
A microbiological study was conducted to assess whether blinatumomab infusion solution can support 
growth of representative microorganisms. Blinatumomab infusion solution incubated at 20°C to 25°C 
supported the growth of some deliberately added microorganism. None of the test organisms showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 15/124 
 
 
 
 
 
growth at 2°C to 8°C up to 16 days. It is mentioned by the Applicant that the risk for infection driven 
by the absence of a preservative can be controlled through compliance with aseptic technique. From a 
microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be 
longer than 24 hours at 2-8°C, unless reconstitution/dilution has taken place in controlled and 
validated aseptic conditions.  
The compatibility of the finished product with diluent solutions (IV solution stabilizer and 0.9 % NaCl) 
and representative bags was evaluated from a physical chemical point of view. The results showed that 
blinatumomab is compatible with polyolefin, PVC and EVA IV bag materials.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturer 
Blinatumomab finished product is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing 
Practices.  
Manufacturing of product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of BLINCYTO starts with pooling and mixing of bulk active substance 
followed by pre-filtration and sterile filtration before aseptically filled into glass vials. The vials are then 
partially stoppered, lyophilised, capped, and visually inspected before labelling and packaging. No 
reprocessing is claimed. 
The validation of the finished product manufacturing process is based on the analysis of three 
consecutive batches covering the claimed batch size. The process validation utilized a lifecycle 
approach. Establishment of the commercial control strategy was based on existing knowledge obtained 
from the development of the process, and risk- and knowledge-based process characterization studies. 
The validation studies included the control of critical in-process controls, as well as additional process 
validation tests. The results met acceptance criteria, demonstrating the finished product manufacturing 
process is consistent throughout the different steps. Holding times have been validated through small-
scale studies. The suitability of membrane filter has been verified. Additional filter membrane 
compatibility and extractable and leachable substances determination are documented. Media fill tests 
have been performed on three runs. No contamination has been observed. Testing frequency and 
complete description of the conditions in which media-fills were performed are not detailed in the 
submission. Nevertheless, this is considered acceptable as these aspects are covered by routine GMP 
inspections.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes tests for general attributes, potency by cell-based bioassay, 
identity (immunoassay), purity (chromatographic), bacterial endotoxin (Ph.Eur.) and sterility (Ph.Eur.). 
The release testing specification is generally acceptable however; some outstanding issues remained 
as regards acceptance criteria for charge variants, aggregates, protein content and polysorbate 80 that 
are satisfactorily answered. It is noted that the Applicant will re-evaluate the finished product 
acceptance criteria when further data are available (minimum of 15 lots).

Reference materials 
The blinatumomab commercial reference standard program consists of two standards: a primary 
reference standard and a working reference standard.  
The reference standards have been prepared from lyophilized finished product and the same reference 
standards are used for testing of both blinatumomab active substance and finished product. The use of 
a reference standard derived from finished product is appropriate because the formulations of active 
substance and finished product are identical.  
The Applicant has adequately described the reference standards used. These reference standards have 
been qualified and the release testing and extended characterization testing results demonstrate that 
both are suitable for their intended use. The current working reference standard is representative of 
commercial batches. Future working standards, as needed, will be prepared and compared to the 
primary reference standards 
Stability of the product 
The Applicant is claiming a 3-year shelf life when stored at 2-8°C. This claim is based on the data 
obtained from three validation lots manufactured using the commercial process, three clinical batches 
using process 5 and five supporting lots manufactured using process 4. The batches derived from 
process 5 can be considered as representative of the commercial ones since they were manufactured 
using the same site and scale, and had the same container closure system than those proposed for 
commercial phase. Moreover, clinical material and commercial batches have been demonstrated 
comparable. The long-term, real-time, real-condition stability studies show slight decrease in 
cytotoxicity relative potency and protein content, and a slight increase in moisture. No clear trend has 
been observed for the other parameters for up to 36 months at 2-8°C. Based on data provided, a 3-
year shelf-life can be granted. 
Experimental studies were also conducted to assess the stability of the finished product under 
conditions that may be experienced during transport, storage and handling. Exposed unlabelled 
lyophilized and reconstituted blinatumomab finished product samples show photo-induced degradation, 
thus leading to the statement that the product should be protected from light. No significant 
degradation was observed for the other studies. The reconstitution study supports the claim of a 
maximum storage time for reconstituted solution: 24 hours at 2-8°C, or 4 hours at or below 27°C.  
For the diluted solution (prepared infusion bag), chemical and physical in-use stability has been 
demonstrated for 10 days at 2C – 8°C or 96 hours at or below 27°C.  
Finished product – Solution (Stabilizer)  
Before administration, the reconstituted blinatumomab solution must be appropriately added to an 
infusion bag containing the solution stabilizer and saline solution (not provided). The provided solution 
stabilizer is presented as a solution for solution for infusion. This sterile aqueous solution stabilizer is 
supplied in a glass vial containing 10mL per vial of citric monohydrate, lysine hydrochloride, (w/v) 
polysorbate 80 and sodium hydroxide, pH 7.0. 
The solution stabilizer has been developed to prevent adsorption of the protein to the surfaces of the 
infusion bag and tubing. Investigations show that the addition of solution stabilizer to the IV bag 
prevents the loss of of blinatumomab due to adsorption. A summary of the solution stabilizer process 
changes has been provided and the selection of components/concentrations for the formulation has

been discussed. The proposed manufacturing process and formulation have been used to manufacture 
solution stabilizer supporting clinical trials. 
The information provided for the solution stabilizer is considered satisfactory to demonstrate it is 
produced in a well-controlled, validated manufacturing process. The solution stabilizer specification is 
acceptable and includes general quality attributes, polysorbate 80 concentration, particles 
contamination, and microbial control. An UV scan is also performed to confirm the absence of protein. 
It is noted that the Company will re-evaluate the finished product acceptance criteria when further 
data are available (minimum of 15 lots).  
Based on data provided, a 5-year shelf life can be granted for the solution stabilizer, when stored at 2-
8°C. 
Adventitious agents 
During the commercial manufacturing process, no primary raw materials of animal origin are used.  
An assessment was conducted for all raw materials used in the development of blinatumomab cell lines 
and in the commercial manufacturing process. Missing information concerning the human recombinant 
insulin used during the banks development has been provided. 
The MCB, WCB and end-of-production (EOP) cells were assayed for adventitious and endogenous 
agents. Except the A-type and C-type retrovirus-like particles which are typical feature of Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, the results of the tests showed no evidence of adventitious agents. 
Regarding the viral clearance capacity of the process, the different studied steps are effective and 
robust to inactivate/eliminate the model viruses. The global reduction factors were satisfactory. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP has recommended some points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Non-clinical studies were performed in vitro and in vivo to investigate the mechanism of action of 
blinatumomab (also known as MT103, AMG 103) in redirecting T cells to lyse CD19+ cells in vitro and 
efficacy in in vivo xenograft models of adult and paediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of blinatumomab were characterized in mice, rats, dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, 
and chimpanzees following single or multiple dose administrations by the IV, SC or IP routes. The 
pivotal toxicology and toxicokinetics studies were performed in accordance with Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) regulations. Blinatumomab has been evaluated in toxicity studies in the chimpanzee, 
rat, dog and rabbit. The majority of the toxicology testing was conducted in mice with a murine 
surrogate molecule (muS103new). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Saturation binding and competition binding experiments were performed on cells expressing CD19 and 
CD3. Bound blinatumomab was detected by flow cytometry using either a fluorescent dye-conjugated 
secondary reagent or blinatumomab labelled with a fluorescent dye (study 103-PCD-0065). 
Blinatumomab was shown to bind to human CD19 with a higher affinity than to human CD3. Further, 
it was shown that blinatumomab binds in a dose-dependent manner to malignant B cell lines NALM-6 
and Raji, and could also bind to normal human B cells. The specificity of binding was evaluated in CHO 
cells which do not express either CD19 or CD3. No detectable binding of blinatumomab to CHO cells 
was shown, in contrast to dose-dependent binding to NALM-6 and human T cells. Other experiments 
showed that the binding of blinatumomab to NALM-6 and human T cells can be competed by the 
parental monoclonal antibodies from which it was derived (HD37 and L2K-07), as compared to 
unrelated monoclonal antibodies. 
Flow cytometry was used to study the binding of blinatumomab to PBMCs from various non-human 
primate species (chimpanzee, Cynomolgus monkey, Rhesus monkey, baboon, African green monkey, 
marmoset, and squirrel monkey), beagle dogs, SJL and ND4 Swiss Webster mice, and rats (studies 
103-PCD-0007 and 103-PCD-0040). In these experiments, T and B lymphocytes in PBMC were 
identified with antibodies recognizing CD4 and CD20, respectively. Human PBMCs were also used as 
positive control. The various binding analyses showed that only PBMC from chimpanzee contain B and 
T lymphocytes that interact with blinatumomab. The binding of blinatumomab to chimpanzee and 
human lymphocytes was comparable. Thereafter, an in vitro cytotoxicity assay was conducted and 
showed that the bispecific binding of blinatumomab to B and T lymphocytes of chimpanzees was of 
functional significance since blinatumomab-mediated autologous B cell depletion was observed. 
The  potential  differences/similarities  in  binding  properties  and  biological  activity  of  blinatumomab  in 
human and chimpanzee were investigated further (study 103-PCD-0066). The results indicated similar 
binding  properties  and  lymphocyte  saturation  in  both  species.  The  mean  EC50  values  obtained  in 
autologous  B  cell  depletion  experiments  and  cytotoxicity  assays  with  NALM-6  pro-B  lymphoma  cells 
using human and chimpanzee PBMC preparations were 80.4 vs. 136.3 pg/mL and 53.0 vs. 46.1 pg/mL, 
respectively.  Cytokine  release  (TNF,  IFN,  IL2)  occurred  at  similar  blinatumomab  concentrations  in 
human and chimpanzee and achieved similar levels at the maximum drug concentration tested.

Since  there are  very limited possibilities to evaluate the  toxicology of  blinatumomab  in  the only non-
clinical relevant species for ethical reasons, the applicant developed a surrogate BiTE molecule specific 
for murine CD3 and murine CD19 from rat monoclonal antibodies. The final construct was designated 
muS103new since it was affinity-optimized from a previous construct called muS103. 
Study 103-PCD-0094 was then performed to validate muS103new as a surrogate molecule for non-
clinical safety testing. Blinatumomab and muS103new were thus compared in vitro with respect to 
affinity, potency, T cell activation, and cytokine release. As regards binding affinity to target receptors, 
it was similar between species for CD19 but muS103new showed 5-fold higher affinity to murine CD3 
than blinatumomab to human CD3. Binding characteristics were considered as comparable, noting also 
that for both molecules the affinity to CD19 is higher than that to CD3. In cytotoxicity assay, there was 
some intra-species and inter-species variability in EC50 values which could be explained by several 
factors: expression level of CD19, effector: target (E:T) ratio, activation status of effector cells, 
susceptibility of target cells to induction of apoptosis, source of effector cells (CD3+ T cells from blood 
of healthy donors vs. murine splenic CD3+ T cells), assay conditions (duration of 24h vs. 72h in human 
vs. murine assays). It is also noted that the cytotoxicity was specific since no cell lysis was observed in 
experiments using murine and human CD19- cell lines. Further, effects on T cell activation were 
similar. Some cytokines were released at a higher (2-3-fold) level in murine assays ((IFN, IL10, IL2) 
whereas TNF and IL4 were similar. 
In study 103-PCD-0065, NALM-6 cells were cultivated with CD3+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of a 
healthy donor in presence of different concentrations of blinatumomab. After 24 hours, specific cell 
lysis was determined by flow cytometry-based cytotoxicity assay (FACS-based KH-26 assay). It was 
shown that blinatumomab mediated lysis of NALM-6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The 
EC50 was below 0.1 ng/mL. Half maximal and 90% cell lysis was reached after less than 2 hours and 
4 hours, respectively. 
In study 103-PCD-0061, similar results were obtained with CD19+ cell lines derived from different 
types of human B cell malignancies, including ALL (NALM-6), mantle cell lymphoma (Granta-519, HBL-
2, NCEB), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (EHEB, MEC-1), and follicular lymphoma (Karpas-422). Cells 
were incubated for 16 hours (20 hours for Karpas-422) at a E:T ratio of 10:1.  
Blinatumomab-mediated redirected lysis of six human paediatric B cell ALL (pBcALL) cell lines KOPN-8, 
SEMc, MHH-CALL-3, 380, REH, and NALM-6 was evaluated in study 103-PCD-0076. Blinatumomab 
mediated  a  dose-  and  time-dependent  redirected  lysis  of  all  six  tumour  cell  lines. In general, 
maximal lysis was already reached after 24 h. EC50  values ranged from 15 to 462 pg/mL (0.27 to 
8.4 pM), and decreased slightly over time. In general, the magnitude of lysis mediated by 
blinatumomab seemed to increase with increasing surface target density, while EC50  values 
decreased. Additional analyses of blinatumomab-induced T cell activation showed that the 
activation markers CD69 (early) and CD25 were up-regulated in a time- and dose-dependent 
manner, in which CD8+ T cells were activated at lower EC50  concentration than CD4+ T cells in all 
cell lines.  Blinatumomab-mediated T cell activation triggered the release of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, 
TNF and IFN-γ cytokines from T cells within 24 h. 
In a further assay, Löffler et al (2003) showed that blinatumomab mediated the lysis of target cells 
(CD19+ normal and malignant cells) within PBMC samples isolated from 25 patients by redirecting the 
endogenous autologous T cells at E:T ratios that are naturally present in their peripheral blood (1:3 to 
1:240).

The specificity of blinatumomab activity was investigated using target cells not expressing CD19 such 
as human HT29 colon carcinoma cells (study 103-PCD-0065). The viability of HT29 cells remained 
unaffected at blinatumomab concentrations up to 100 ng/mL, i.e. 1000-fold greater than the EC50 
values determined in NALM-6 cells. Blinatumomab-mediated killing of NALM-6 cells was observed. 
MT102, a BiTE antibody having the same CD3-binding scFv as blinatumomab and the other scFv 
recognizing the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), led to the potent killing of the EpCAM+ 
HT29 cell line but was inactive against CD19+ NALM-6 cell line.  
The contribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations to blinatumomab-mediated cytoxicity was 
tested in study 103-PCD-0065. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations isolated from PBMCs and 
incubated for 4 hours with NALM-6 cells in presence of different concentrations of blinatumomab to 
perform a FACS-based cytotoxicity assay (E:T ratio of 5:1). Under these experimental conditions, 
blinatumomab-mediated cytotoxicity was primarily mediated by CD8+ T cells (80% lysis, EC50 of 
10 pg/mL), with contribution of CD4+ T cells (20% lysis at up to 100 ng/mL). However, when the 
incubation period was prolonged to 16 hours in a subsequent experiment, CD4+ T cells had gained 
considerable specific cytotoxicity (maximal lysis of 40%, EC50< 1 ng/mL). In a subsequent experiment 
with an E:T ratio of 1:1, it was shown that naïve CD8+ T cells (CD45RA, devoid of cytotoxic granules) 
did not mediate significant lysis of NALM-6 cells while primed CD8+ T cells (CD45RO, with cytotoxic 
granules) readily killed the B cell targets (EC50 of approximately 100 pg/mL).  
To investigate whether in vitro efficacy of blinatumomab could vary according to the cytotoxic potency 
of T cells isolated from different donors, CD3+ T cells prepared from PBMCs of 87 human donors were 
subjected to a dose-response analysis using NALM-6 target cells (4-h fluorochrome release assays) 
(study 103-PCD-0065). Some variation was observed in terms of EC50 values (7 to 100 pg/mL) and 
maximal cell lysis (25 to 95%). A correlation was observed between both parameters (the lower EC50 
value, the higher the extent of cell lysis). Most donors (74%) showed EC50 values between 10-
80 pg/mL with a peak between 30-40 pg/mL (18%). A subset of donors (20%) had EC50 values 
> 130 pg/mL.  
Blinatumomab was shown to be effective over a wide range of E:T ratio. As shown in study 103-PCD-
0067 investigating ratios between 200:1 and 1:200, maximal target cell lysis decreased and EC50 
values increased with decreasing E:T ratios and almost no redirected lysis was observed at ratios 
below 1:10. An E:T ratio of 10:1 was considered as optimal for the conduct of in vitro studies. It was 
also showed that maximal T-cell activation (examined by expression of CD69 and CD25) occurred at 
E:T ratios between 1:1 and 1:10.  
The ability of blinatumomab to initiate T cell proliferation was investigated in study 103-PCD-0065. 
Proliferation assays were performed using human normal or B cell-depleted PBMCs. T cell proliferation 
was measured by bromodeoxyuridine uptake after incubation with blinatumomab at concentrations 
ranging from 0 to 63 ng/mL, MT102 (63 ng/mL), or a combination of T cell mitogens 
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and IL-2. A proliferative response was seen with the combination of 
T mitogens in normal and B depleted PBMCs. A similar proliferative response was observed with 
blinatumomab exclusively in presence of CD19+ B cells at 0.063 ng/mL and above; the effect did not 
increase much with increasing doses. The lack of T cell proliferation in B cell-depleted PBMCs could not 
be overcome at blinatumomab concentrations reaching 1000-fold the EC50 for redirected lysis. In 
addition, essentially no T cell proliferation was detected in PBMCs (normal and depleted) treated with 
MT102 which has the same CD3-binding region as blinatumomab but directed against EpCAM, not 
CD19. Additional data show that expression of the T cell activation markers CD69 and CD25 was highly 
dependent on the presence of target cells (Brischwein et al, 2007).

NALM-6 cells and human PBMCs (E:T ratio of 10:1) were exposed to increasing concentrations of 
blinatumomab for 48 hours, and granzyme B expression was evaluated in CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells(study 103-PCD-0063). In both subsets, there was a time- and dose-dependent increase in 
granzyme B positive cells. Induction of granzyme B occurred faster and at lower concentrations in 
CD8+ T cells. Both subsets are thus able to exert effector function following blinatumomab-mediated 
activation. 
Human T CD3+ cells were cultured with NALM-6 cells (E:T ratio of 10:1) in presence of blinatumomab 
(1 ng/mL). Culture supernatants were screened for levels of TNF, IL-2, and IFN. Blinatumomab-
mediated redirected lysis was evaluated by means of a FACS-based assay (study 103-PCD-0065). Half 
maximal lysis was seen before 2 hours after addition of blinatumomab, and maximal lysis was 
achieved at 4 hours (nearly 90%). TNF, IL-2, and IFN were found in the culture supernatants 
starting at 2 hours post-dosing and peaking at 6 hours. TNF was the first cytokine at significant 
concentration in the medium, followed by IFN. Similar results were obtained with Raji cells, and 
human primary B cells(in Raji cells, 3-fold higher IL-2 levels were measured).

In study R20140011, separate experiments were conducted using dynamic flow chambers to assess 
lymphocyte-endothelial cell interactions under hydrodynamic conditions. HUVEC and human brain 
microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were used. Addition of blinatumomab to the flow system 
reduced T cell-rolling velocity and increased the number of T cells firmly adhering to endothelial cells. 
In the presence of both T cells and blinatumomab, endothelial cells upregulated cell surface expression 
of several adhesion molecules. Further addition of agents with potential anti-adhesive properties (e.g., 
pentosan polysulfate, minocycline, and natalizumab) reversed these blinatumomab - induced effects at 
least back to levels that were also observed for T cell-rolling velocity, T cell-adhesion and endothelial 
activation in the absence of blinatumomab. 
In study R20140012, the effect of TNF, released upon blinatumomab -induced T cell activation, on 
endothelial cells in vitro co-cultures comprising endothelial cells, PBMC/T cells, and blinatumomab in 
the presence and absence of CD19+ target cells was evaluated. Blinatumomab induced an up-
regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on HUVEC in co-incubation assays with PBMC/T cells and CD19+ 
NALM-6 cells. These effects were mainly driven by TNF as coincidental incubation with etanercept 
reduced the up-regulation of ICAM-1 by 60 - 80%. No T cell activation was observed in the absence of 
CD19+ cells. However an ICAM-1 up-regulation on HUVEC was observed in the absence of CD19+ 
cells, but at much lower levels (~100-fold higher blinatumomab concentrations). TNF effects on 
HUVEC, up-regulation of adhesion molecules and cytokines, were primarily mediated via TNFRI. Both 
TNFRs were down-regulated on HUVEC when co-incubated with PBMC and NALM-6 cells in the presence 
of blinatumomab. While TNFRI was also down-regulated on activated T cells, an up-regulation of 
TNFRII was observed following T cell activation. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Potential effects of blinatumomab on the CNS were investigated in mice with the murine surrogate 
muS103new at IV doses of 0, 0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg/day for 5 days (study 103-PCD-0078). Behaviour 
and CNS function were evaluated using a primary observation (Irwin) test. The results suggested the 
absence of effects of muS103new at 0.2 and 5 mg/kg i.v. in the primary observation (Irwin) test in 
BALB/cJ mice. At 1 mg/kg i.v., sedative/myorelaxant effects (decreased activity and reactivity, 
piloerection and motor signs) were observed starting on the third day of treatment in 1 of 6 treated 
mice. 
In study 103-PCD-0103, male mice (10/group) were treated by continuous intracerebroventricular 
(ICV) infusion for 7 days at 0.042 mg/kg/day and at the maximum technically feasible dose of 
0.978 mg/kg/day. Animals were examined pre-exposure and up to 6 times daily through day 10 for 
behavioural effects. In these experimental conditions, neither the vehicle nor muS103new at 0.042 or 
0.978 mg/kg/d induced any observable behavioural modifications, evidence of physiological change or 
neurotoxicity from Days 2 to 10. Mean body weight was also unaffected over this interval. All animals 
Assessment report

displayed slight to moderate piloerection and a slightly decreased activity was observed in three 
animals of Group 2 between Days 2 and 4. 
No effect on cardiovascular and respiratory parameters parameters was observed in study 103-PCD-
0006 in anaesthetized dogs (pharmacologically irrelevant species) with blinatumomab early in 
development.  
In mice, respiratory parameters were assessed by plethysmography and showed no effect of 
muS103new at doses up to 5 mg/kg (study 103-PCD-0077). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The influence of dexamethasone and indomethacin pre-treatment on blinatumomab-dependent cell 
lysis and cytokine production was examined in vitro using human PBMCs and NALM-6 cells (study 103-
PCD-0071). 
Dexamethasone reduced the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-α at a concentration of 3x10-7 M, when 
the effector cells were pre-treated for 1 hour and dexamethasone was present during the cell lysis 
phase. The secretion of the cytokines IFN-γ and IL-10 was also reduced but to a lower extent. After a 
14-hour pre-incubation period, but absent during the blinatumomab effector phase, dexamethasone 
still reduced the cytokine production, although the reduction was less pronounced. Pre-treatment of 
the effector cells with indomethacin alone did not diminish cytokine production. 
Blinatumomab-mediated cell lysis was affected neither by dexamethasone nor by indomethacin pre-
treatment. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In mice treated with blinatumomab, a dose-proportional increase in exposure was noted in the IV 
groups. The volume of distribution based on the terminal phase ranged from 150 to 350 mL/kg, and 
the clearance from 70 to 105 mL/h/kg. The absolute SC bioavailability reached 35%. The half-life did 
not exceed 2.5 hours. Investigations performed with muS103new reported an absolute SC 
bioavailability of 15% and half-life values not exceeding 1.4 hours (study 103-PCD-0081). 
In rats, an over-proportional increase in systemic exposure was noted over the 25 to 2500 µg/kg dose 
range given by IV route. In contrast, SC administration of the same dose levels by the SC route 
resulted in a dose-proportional increase in exposure. Absolute SC bioavailability ranged from 8% to 
16%. The half-life values were 5-7 hours after IV dosing. In the SC groups, it reached 8 hours at the 
high dose level (2500 µg/kg) and increased with decreasing doses at up to 126 hours (study 103-PCD-
0039).  
In Cynomolgus monkeys, the absolute SC bioavailability was 21%. Upon IV administration, the 
systemic exposure increased in a dose-proportional manner from 10 to 500 µg/kg. The half-life ranged 
from 1 to 2.7 hours at up to 100 µg/kg, and reached 6.3 hours at 500 µg/kg (study 103-PCD-0062). 
In the pharmacologically-relevant species (chimpanzee), blinatumomab was administered IV by means 
of 2-hour infusions once weekly. The half-life ranged from 1.5 to 2.6 hours. Cmax levels remained 
constant throughout the dosing period in the 4-week study (study 103-PCD-0024). 
The volume of distribution (Vz) of blinatumomab was estimated from IV dosing in various animal 
species. It reached 268, 55, and 68-110 mL/kg in mice, dogs, and chimpanzee, respectively (studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 24/124 
 
 
 
 
 
103-PCD-0081, 103-PCD-0008, 103-PCD-0015/0016). The murine surrogate, muS103new, had a Vz of 
377.5 mL/kg in mice (study 103-PCD-0090). 
After IV dosing, the mean systemic clearance of blinatumomab was 91 mL/hr/kg in mice, 
152 mL/hr/kg in rats, 40 mL/h/kg in Cynomolgus monkeys, 19 mL/hr/kg in dogs and 35 mL/hr/kg in 
chimpanzee. The mean terminal half-lives in the tested species ranged from 1.5 to 8 hours, indicating 
rapid elimination of the drug. 
The role of renal elimination of blinatumomab was investigated using bilaterally nephrectomised 
C57BL/6 mice (study 103-PCD-0093). After a 250 µg/kg IV bolus, the elimination half-life was 
increased by 3-fold compared to the non-nephrectomised mice and the systemic exposure (AUC) was 
also significantly increased by approximately 27-fold. Systemic clearance was reduced by 
approximately 27-fold.  
2.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic parameters were obtained by sampling after the first and repeated administrations in 
toxicology studies. In mice treated with muS103new, systemic exposure increased in a dose-
proportional manner on Day 1 after IV dosing, and also at most occasions after SC dosing. No 
apparent gender-related difference was noted.   
In the 4-week IV study, exposure levels were significantly lower on D28 vs. D1 at the high dose level, 
but not at the low and mid dose levels. No ADA was detected in high-dosed animals, whereas anti-
muS103new antibodies were detected at the low dose level (1 animal from a satellite group).

Limited sampling schedule was performed in rats treated IV with blinatumomab and showed dose-
proportional increase in exposure and no gender-related difference after the first dose based on 
concentration measured at 5 minutes post-dosing. Similar exposure levels were measured at D14. 
Local Tolerance  
A local tolerance study was performed in rabbits with an early formulation of 5% human serum 
albumin (study 103-PCD-0010). Five routes of administration were assessed using a single dose 
regimen: intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, paravenous, and subcutaneous. Blinatumomab was 
well-tolerated after all of the tested routes of administration. There were no macroscopic changes at 
any of the evaluation points with the exception of 1 animal which had a hematoma at the 
blinatumomab p.v. injection site at 2, 24, and 48 hours post-dose. Minimal to mild focal lympho-
histiocytic infiltration was observed at 48 and/or 96 hours at blinatumomab injection sites after i.m., 
p.v. or s.c. injections but had resolved by 14 days. Similar changes were seen in the saline treated 
sites. Minimal to moderate haemorrhage and focal purulent dermatitis were observed at 48 and/or 
96 hours at some injection sites in both blinatumomab and 0.9% saline treated animals. Overall, no 
changes attributable to blinatumomab were observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
The potential immunogenicity has been evaluated in female BALB/c mice receiving multiple 
intravenous (i.v.) and subcutaneous (s.c) administrations of muS103new (study 103-PCD-0089).  
Consecutive daily i.v. and s.c injections of muS103new to BALB/c mice over 42 days (at 0.05 mg/kg) 
resulted in the formation of anti-muS103new specific as well as neutralizing antibodies. 
Anti-muS103new antibodies were first detected 23 days after muS103new treatment start. At that 
time, one out of five mice treated i.v. and one out of five mice treated s.c., exhibited antimuS103new 
antibodies in their serum. On Day 29, all five i.v. tested mice and three out of five s.c. treated mice 
were positive for anti-muS103new antibodies. Ongoing treatment resulted in increased anti-
muS103new antibody titers and by Day 43 of treatment, four out of five mice in the s.c. and all five 
tested mice in the i.v. treated group were positive for antimuS103new antibodies. MuS103new 
treatment of BALB/c mice decreased the numbers of circulating CD19+ B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
within the first ten days. During a washout period of approximately four weeks, a partial recovery of 
circulating CD19+ B cells and CD4+, CD8+ T cells in PBMC was observed. After re-exposure to 
muS103new for eight days the reduction of T and B lymphocytes was partly impaired in individual 
mice, indicating that anti-drug-antibodies neutralized the pharmacological effects of muS103new. Re-
exposure resulted in a persistent reduction of B and T cells numbers in mice that exhibited low serum 
concentrations of anti-muS103new antibodies until the end of the study on Day 86. 
The cross-reactivity of blinatumomab was evaluated with cryosections of normal human tissues (3 
donors / tissue) at 10 and 50 µg/mL (study 103-PCD-0041). The following tissues were investigated: 
adrenal, brain (cerebellum, cortex), blood leukocytes, blood vessels (endothelium), bone marrow, 
mammary gland, eye, fallopian tube, GI tract (colon, oesophagus, small intestine, stomach), heart, 
kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid, peripheral nerve, pituitary, placenta, 
prostate, salivary gland, skin, spinal cord, spleen, striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, 
ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus (endometrium, cervix). In normal human tissues, blinatumomab 
stained lymphocytes which were judged to be T cells and B cells based on their morphology and 
location. These cells were abundant in lymphoid tissues such as the tonsil, spleen, thymus, and lymph

node. In other tissues, very rare or occasional intravascular, migrating, or interstitial lymphocytes were 
stained by blinatumomab.   
2.4.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Blinatumomab is a protein, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the 
substance in the environment. Therefore, blinatumomab it is not expected to result in a significant risk 
to the environment. 
2.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A murine surrogate (muS103new) was developed and is considered as similar to blinatumomab with 
regard to binding to CD19 and CD3 on respective cells, efficacy of redirected target cell lysis, and 
ability to activate T cells in a target cell-dependent manner. 
In vitro functional assays showed blinatumomab-mediated redirected lysis of CD19 positive cell 
tumours (adult and paediatric cell lines) as well as patient tumour samples. This cytotoxic activity was 
specific since it could only be observed in the presence of target-expressing cells, in accordance with 
other experimental results showing that T cell proliferation was also dependent on the presence of 
these target cells. The EC50 values determined for tumour cell lysis were mostly below 500 pg/mL 
although some variability was noted. Several factors contributing to this variation in potency were 
identified and even investigated further such as the cytotoxic potency of T cells isolated from different 
donors, the amount of target cell surface expression, and the effector-to-target cell ratio. The key 
players involved in the cytotoxic effect of blinatumomab were identified as being the previously primed 
CD8+ T cells while naïve CD8+ T cells were not able to kill target cells. CD4+ T cells were shown to 
contribute to the cytotoxic effect upon longer incubation period. Importantly, the cytotoxic 
lymphocytes were able to kill the target cells without co-stimulatory signals.  
The effect of blinatumomab on T cells was characterized by a strong proliferative response which was 
dependent on the presence of target cells, induction of the synthesis of granzyme B which was faster 
and occurred at lower concentrations in CD8+ T than in CD4+ T cells, and release of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines TNF, IFN, IL2, IL4, IL6, and IL10. In vivo studies performed in chimpanzees with 
blinatumomab showed the same profile of cytokine release with additional increase of IL-6 levels. The 
highest cytokine levels were in general measured after the first injection and decreased upon repeated 
dosing. The up-regulation of cytokine production may provide long-term effect, especially enhancing 
the expression of other cytokines as well as adhesion molecules. The up-regulation of VCAM-1 was of 
particular interest since it specifically binds alpha4beta1 expressed by T cells that allow the migration 
of lymphocytes from the blood flow to the CNS. It is therefore plausible that the up-regulation of both 
proinflammatory cytokines and VCAM-1 may at least in part contribute to neurologic adverse events 
seen in the blinatumomab-treated subjects (see clinical safety). By contrast, it is unlikely that CD19+ 
cells induce any CNS damage since the number of B lymphocytes reaching the CNS is very small. In 
conclusion, although the mechanistic basis for the neurological adverse effects seen in blinatumomab-
treated patients remains poorly understood, "cytokine release syndrome" is listed as an important 
identified risks based on non-clinical data and "worsening of CNS events in patients with CNS 
pathology" is listed as an important potential risk (Risk Management Plan). Warning regarding signs 
and symptoms of neurologic events following start of BLINCYTO administration and their management 
as reported in SmPC section 4.4, appears adequate as risk minimisation measure.

Cardiovascular function was monitored during the toxicity studies performed with blinatumomab in a 
total of 6 chimpanzees. Changes in blood pressure (hypotension) were observed in some animals and 
may be related to a treatment-related increase in cytokine levels. This effect was shown to be dose-
dependent in the dose escalation study and triggered supportive measures at the top dose (0.12 
µg/kg) (see discussion on clinical safety). Safety pharmacology and toxicology studies performed with 
muS103new and blinatumomab did not suggest any effect on the central nervous system. 
In chimpanzees, a treatment-related effect could not be excluded as regards the occurrence of 
infections in two animals (acute bronchopneumonia, ear infection). A dose-dependent decrease in 
blood pressure (and compensatory increase in heart rate) was observed during and immediately 
following treatment, and was dose-limiting at 0.12 µg/kg. Otherwise, treatment was well tolerated. In 
general, the effects at ≥ 0.06 µg/kg/week were consistent with the pharmacological activity of 
blinatumomab: B cell depletion, T cell activation and redistribution, and transient cytokine release. 
B cell depletion was reported following each infusion, with tendency to a gradual dropping over study 
period; B cell counts reached 50% of baseline values at the end of dosing period, and the effect 
remained up to the end of the 4-week recovery period. A more pronounced depletion was not reached 
probably in relation to PK/PD effects, since blinatumomab has a short half-life in chimpanzees (1.5-2.6 
hours) and animals received a 2-h IV infusion once weekly. This intermittent dosing regimen may not 
have been sufficient. In contrast, patients will be treated by continuous IV infusion for 28 days. This 
may also explain the lack of effect on histology or B- and T- cell populations noted in lymph node 
samples. T cell activation was demonstrated through the increase of early and late activation markers 
CD69 and sCD25, respectively, and was in line with the profile of cytokine released transiently after 
each infusion with highest levels measured after the first dose (IL-6, IL-2, TNF, IFN,). A transient 
decrease in circulating T cells was observed after each infusion. Other effects included transient 
increase in body temperature, CRP, liver enzymes, and bilirubin. This is consistent with the potential 
effects of cytokine released, notably IL-6. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with blinatumomab and the murine surrogate revealed the 
expected pharmacologic effects (including release of cytokines, decreases in leukocyte counts, 
depletion of B-cells, decreases in T-cells, decreased cellularity in lymphoid tissues). These changes 
reversed after cessation of treatment (SmPC section 5.3).  
As regards to local tolerance, no findings were reported at injection site in IV studies. In the mouse SC 
studies with muS103new, the incidence of inflammatory changes at treated sites was increased in 
treated groups. In the 13-week study, a similar effect was seen in the skin overlying the mammary 
tissue and considered as having most likely arisen from dispersion of muS103new along the 
subcutaneous fascial planes. These findings were attributed to a slight exacerbation of the local 
response to the injection procedure possibly related to the effect on lymphocyte populations and not of 
toxicological significance since they were fully reversible, and not associated with degenerative 
changes.  
In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies were not performed in accordance with ICH S6 (R1). 
Blinatumomab is a recombinant protein consisting entirely of naturally-occuring amino acids and 
contains no inorganic or synthetic linkers or other non-protein portions, making it highly unlikely that it 
would react directly with DNA or other chromosome material.  
Based on the mechanism of action of blinatumomab, it is highly unlikely to induce tumour development 
or proliferation. As it is being developed for advanced cancer indications, no carcinogenicity studies 
have been conducted, in accordance with ICH S9.

Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with blinatumomab. In an embryo-foetal 
developmental toxicity study performed in mice, the murine surrogate crossed the placenta to a limited 
extent (foetal-to-maternal serum concentration ratio < 1%) and did not induce embryo-foetal toxicity 
or teratogenicity. The expected depletions of B- and T-cells were observed in the pregnant mice but 
haematological effects were not assessed in foetuses. No studies have been conducted to evaluate 
treatment-related effects on fertility. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs in 
toxicity studies with the murine surrogate (SmPC section 5.3). 
Development of ADAs in the pivotal toxicity studies did not impact on their validity since neither the 
kinetics nor the pharmacological effect of muS103new or blinatumomab were affected. The occurrence 
of ADAs was mainly reported at low dose levels, which may not have completely disrupted humoral 
immunity. 
An ex vivo tissue cross-reactivity study showed specific blinatumomab binding which was restricted to 
lymphocytes in human tissues. 
The justification provided by the Applicant for not performing environmental risk assessment studies 
was considered acceptable since blinatumomab is a protein that is expected to degrade into small 
peptides and amino acids and is, therefore, unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
This is in accordance with the “Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*).

Distribution 
Following the continuous intravenous infusion (cIV) infusion of blinatumomab, the steady state serum 
concentration (Css) was achieved within one day and remained stable over the infusion period. The 
mean Css values increased approximately dose proportionally from 5 to 90 mcg/m2/d doses and the 
mean (standard deviation [SD]) Css values at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 mcg/m2/d were 210 (84.9), 651

(307), 1210 (476), 2730 (985), and 3490 (904) pg/mL, respectively (Study MT103-104). The vast 
majority of the subjects achieved Css within the first day of a 28 day cycle, regardless of renal function. 
In the paediatric population, the mean Css was 620 pg/mL (SD: 305) between 7 to 17 years (n=14), 
390 pg/mL (SD: 286) in the 2 to 6 years age group (n=12) and 552 pg/mL (237) in adults, at dose of 
15 mcg/m2/day. 
The estimated mean (SD) volume of distribution based on terminal phase (Vz) was 4.52 (2.89) L with 
the continuous intravenous infusion of blinatumomab (SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
The estimated mean (SD) systemic clearance with continuous intravenous infusion in patients receiving 
blinatumomab in clinical studies was 2.92 (2.83) L/hour. The mean (SD) half-life was 2.11 (1.42) 
hours. Negligible amounts of blinatumomab were excreted in the urine at the tested clinical doses 
(SmPC section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was tested in study MT103-104, with five different doses between 5 mcg/m2/d 
and 90 mcg/m2/d. Blinatumomab was shown have dose-proportional steady-state concentrations 
between 5 mcg/m2/d and 90 mcg/m2/d (slope = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.028, 1.114). Results are presented 
in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Mean serum concentration at steady state versus dose in study MT103-104 
In the various clinical studies with multiple cycles of continuous infusion, Css was reached within the 
first day and there was little to no accumulation through time and cycles. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The results of a retrospective analysis of the effects of renal function (represented by creatinine 
clearance [CrCL]) on blinatumomab clearance, as estimated by non-compartmental analysis, are 
shown in Table 10.  The CrCL values were calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula and were provided in 
the clinical datasets of Studies MT103-104, MT103-202, MT103-206, and MT103-211. No patients with 
severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min) were enrolled in these trials.

Impaired hepatic function 
Baseline alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] levels were used to 
assess the effect of hepatic function on the clearance of blinatumomab.  As shown below, there is no 
apparent association between ALT or AST levels and the clearance of blinatumomab.

Gender 
Overall, there were 192 males vs. 108 females. No impact on blinatumomab clearance was evident for 
any of the factors examined (data not shown). 
Race 
In study MT103-211, blinatumomab PK data were collected from 159 Caucasians, 6 black, 6 Asians 
and 39 subjects in other race/unknown.  The ranges of CL values were similar across these groups 
(data not shown).   
Weight 
Blinatumomab was studied using a BSA-based dosing in Studies MT103-104, MT103202, and MT103-
206 and a fixed dosing in Study MT103-211. Throughout the studies, the body weight ranged from 44 
to 134 kg andBSA ranged from 1.4 to 2.6 m2. Relationship between CL and weight or BSA is presented 
in Figure 4.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
An in vitro study (report NSX0011) was performed to investigate the potential inhibition of CYP450 
activities by Blinatumomab. Parallel incubations were performed with three cytokine cocktail prepared 
at three strengths, representing the low (CCC: 125 pg/mL), middle (CCA: 500-2000 pg/mL), and high 
(CCB: 1000-20000 pg/ml) peak serum cytokine concentrations observed in the blinatumomab clinical 
studies. Results are shown in Table 11. 
Table 6. Cytochrome P450 suppression by MT103 (3000 pg/mL) compared to cytokine 
cocktails of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α 
Based on presented results, the effects of cytokines in different combinations showed variable effects 
on each CYP450 isoform and a large inter-donor variability. The magnitude of suppression was 
generally higher with the 48-hour incubation period and with the middle and high strengths of cytokine 
cocktails. Since there was little difference in suppression between the middle and high strength groups, 
the effect of cytokines appeared to be maximized at the tested concentration range. Based on the 
worst case scenario (incubation time of 48h), cytokines caused suppression of all investigated CYP450 
(CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5) activities. The cytokine effect on CYP450 
suppression was tested at constant concentrations for 24 or 48 hours while clinically observed cytokine 
elevation was transient and the peak concentration only lasted for 1-2 hours (returning quickly to 
baseline levels within 24 hours).

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) PBPK modeling and simulation approach was employed 
to project in vivo the potential effect of the clinically observed cytokine elevation on CYP450 activities 
in patients. The model predicted that IL-6 elevation resulted in a maximal suppression of hepatic 
intrinsic clearance of CYP3A4, CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 by less than 30% and the duration of this 
suppression was approximately 1 week. With the profiles of IL-6 elevation observed clinically, 
exposures of prototype substrates of CYP3A4 (simvastatin, midazolam) CYP1A2 (theophylline, 
caffeine), and CYP2C9 (S-warfarin) were predicted to be increased by less than 2-fold, and effects 
lasted less than a week. 
2.6.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
There was no specific pharmacodynamics (PD) clinical study in the blinatumomab clinical program, but 
PD was assessed along 4 clinical studies (MT103-104, MT103-202, MT103-206, MT103-211). 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Following initiation of blinatumomab continuous IV infusion or dosing escalation, peripheral T cells 
initially declined quickly to very low levels within 1 to 2 days, a phenomenon described as 
redistribution (Figure 5). After the initial decline, T cells started to increase and reached baseline 
levels.  The time to return to baseline was variable across patients (7 to 30 days). Baseline T cells 
appeared to be similar across studies with large inter-subject variability and were not associated with 
any demographic factors (e.g. age, sex, weight and body surface area).

a hematological complete remission (CR/CRh*) during the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment; red lines 
represent patients without CR/CRh* during the first 2 treatment cycles. 
Blinatumomab caused a complete, dose-dependent and sustainable depletion of circulating B-cells at 
dose level of ≥ 5 μg/m²/day. B-cell depletion was not observed in a few of non-responder patients: in 
4 out of 47 evaluable subjects in Study MT103-211 (8.5%; a subset of the total subjects treated had 
an analysis of lymphocytes) and in Study MT103-206, in 1 out of 34 evaluable subjects (2.9%). 
Subjects who did not show B cell depletion had a peripheral CD19+ cell count > 2000 cells/ mL before 
blinatumomab treatment. The data showed an effective depletion of B cells by the end of 4 weeks of 
blinatumomab treatment; however, peripheral B cells were still measureable by the end of week 3. No 
recovery of peripheral B-cells was observed during the drug-free period between treatment cycles. 
Results are shown in Figure 6.

dynamic profile for one subject with NHL (Figure 7).  The elevated cytokine levels returned to baseline 
within  24  to  48  hours  while  the  infusion  was  ongoing.  In  subsequent  treatment  cycles,  cytokine 
elevation was observed in fewer patients with less intensity. The measured cytokines were TNF-α, IL-2, 
IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-4, or IFN-γ.

Subjects were monitored throughout each study to characterise the development of anti blinatumomab 
antibodies and to explore the impact of any positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA) on the 
pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab. A low incidence of immunogenicity (< 1%, 3 out of 325 subjects, 
neutralizing ADA showed in all 3 cases) was found in the 4 adult studies.  Two out of the 3 subjects 
who showed positive neutralizing ADA had reduced blinatumomab exposure based on the drug 
concentrations-time profiles (data not shown). 
QT evaluation 
QT/QTc assessments were prospectively performed in the phase 1, NHL study, MT103-104 that was 
conducted over 4 to 8 weeks in subjects with relapsed NHL. In this study 76 subjects were enrolled 
into 6 dose groups (20 separate cohorts): ≤5 μg/m2/d (n = 12), 15 μg/m2/d (n = 13), 30 μg/m2/d (n= 
6), 60 μg/m2/d (n = 41), and 90 μg/m2/d (n = 4). Of the 76 subjects enrolled in the study, 12 of them 
received additional or retreatment cycles as per protocol pre-specified criteria, leading to a total of 88 
available data sets for ECG purposes. A total of 181 of 283 valid ECGs were taken at blinatumomab 
dose levels between 15 and 60 μg/m2/day, which was the range of dosages used in later clinical 
studies. No significant findings with regard to repolarization abnormalities in the context of QT 
prolongation were found (data not shown). 
2.6.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab appear linear over a dose range from 5 to 90 mcg/m2/day 
(approximately equivalent to 9-162 mcg/day) in adult patients. Following continuous intravenous 
infusion, the steady state serum concentration (Css) was achieved within a day and remained stable 
over time. The increase in mean Css values was approximately proportional to the dose in the range 
tested. At the clinical doses of 9 mcg/day and 28 mcg/day for the treatment of relapsed/refractory 
ALL, the mean (SD) Css was 211 (258) pg/mL and 621 (502) pg/mL, respectively (SmPC section 5.2).

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic 
characteristics on blinatumomab pharmacokinetics. Results suggest that age (18 to 80 years), gender, 
body weight (44 to 134 kg), and body surface area (1.39 to 2.57) do not influence the 
pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab (SmPC, section 5.2).  
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of blinatumomab have been conducted in patients with renal 
impairment. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed an approximately 2-fold difference in mean 
blinatumomab clearance values between subjects with moderate renal dysfunction and normal renal 
function. However high inter-subject variability was discerned (CV% up to 95.6%), and clearance 
values in renal impaired subjects were essentially within the range observed in subjects with normal 
renal function, no clinically meaningful impact of renal function on clinical outcomes is expected 
(SmPC, section 5.2). 
No formal pharmacokinetic studies of blinatumomab have been conducted in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Baseline ALT and AST levels were used to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the 
clearance of blinatumomab. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that there was no 
association between ALT or AST levels and the clearance of blinatumomab (SmPC, section 5.2).  
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Results from an in vitro test in human 
hepatocytes suggest that blinatumomab did not affect CYP450 enzyme activities (SmPC, section 4.5).  
Initiation of blinatumomab treatment causes transient release of cytokines during the first days of 
treatment that may suppress CYP450 enzymes. Patients who are receiving medicinal products that are 
CYP450 and transporter substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be monitored for adverse 
effects (e.g. warfarin) or drug concentrations (e.g. cyclosporine) during this time. The dose of the 
concomitant medicinal product should be adjusted as needed (SmPC, section 4.5). 
The suggested mechanism of action appears biologically plausible based on in vitro- and non-clinical 
studies. No additional clinical pharmacodynamic studies are considered necessary. 
Peripheral T-cell redistribution (i.e., T-cell adhesion to blood vessel endothelium and/or transmigration 
into tissue) occurred after start of blinatumomab infusion or dose escalation. T-cell counts initially 
declined within 1 to 2  days and then returned to baseline levels within 7 to 14  days in the majority of 
patients. Increase of T-cell counts above baseline (T-cell expansion) was observed in few patients 
(SmPC section 5.1).  
Peripheral B-cell depletion was observed in all subjects who responded to treatment and this is likely 
the consequence of redirected lysis by T cells and levels of B cells remain depressed during 
blinatumomab treatment. B cell depletion was not observed in Study MT103-211, in 4 out of 47 
evaluable subjects (8.5%; a subset of the total subjects treated had an analysis of lymphocytes). It 
was also not observed in Study MT103-206, in 1 out of 34 evaluable subjects (2.9%); the potential 
mechanism for the lack of a B cell response is not known but may be related to the kinetics of the 
CD19+ cell population. Subjects who did not show B cell depletion had a very high peripheral CD19+ 
cell count > 2000 cells/ mL before blinatumomab treatment, possibly the result of faster blast cell 
growth than B cell depletion.  Hence, the total number of B cells would increase rather than decrease.  
Moreover, impaired T cell function from the effects of previous chemotherapies, severity of the disease, 
or a combination of these factors could affect the rate of B cell depletion. 
Cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ were measured and, IL-6, IL-
10 and IFN-γ were most elevated. Transient elevation of cytokines was observed in the first two days 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015

following start of blinatumomab infusion. The elevated cytokine levels returned to baseline within 24 to 
48 hours during the infusion. In subsequent treatment cycles, cytokine elevation occurred in fewer 
patients with lesser intensity compared to the initial 48 hours of the first treatment cycle (SmPC 
section 5.1). 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of blinatumomab have been 
adequately investigated. 
2.7.  Clinical efficacy 
2.7.1.  Dose response studies 
Study MT103-104  
This trial was a Phase 1 non-randomized, non-controlled, open-label inter-patient dose escalation study 
in 76 adult subjects with relapsed B-lineage NHL. The primary objective was to determine the safety 
and tolerability of cIV infusions of blinatumomab at different dose levels in order to determine the 
maximal tolerable dose.  
Blinatumomab was administered as 4- or 8-week cIV infusion at 7 dose levels ranging from 0.5 to 
90 μg/m²/day. Subjects were treated with either a consistent dose throughout the treatment period or 
intra-individual dose escalations, e.g., 5/60 or 5/15/60 μg/m2/day. Seventy-six subjects received 
blinatumomab treatment in this study. Most subjects (75%; 57/76) were men; all were Caucasian; the 
mean (SD) age was 60.3 (12.4) years (range: 20-80 years); and 53.3% of subjects had stage IV 
tumor.    
The efficacy of blinatumomab was dose-dependent. Peripheral B-cell depletion was observed in all 
subjects at a dose of ≥ 5 μg/m²/day. No objective responses were seen at doses < 15 μg/m2/day. At 
dose levels 15 and 30 μg/m²/day, 4 objective responses (2 complete responses [CRs] and 2 partial 
responses [PRs]) were observed among 19 subjects (21%). At 60 μg/m²/day, the objective response 
rate (ORR) was 69% (24 of 35 subjects). Dose escalation was continued up to 90 μg/m²/day, but this 
dose level was not tolerated. In light of a higher ORR at 60 μg/m²/day, this dose was selected as the 
target dose for the treatment of NHL.  
Cytokine elevation (primarily IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10, as well as TNF-α and IFN-γ in some subjects) was 
the highest at doses ≥ 60 μg/m2/day. With 3 out of 4 subjects experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (1 
grade 3 event of convulsion and 2 grade 3 events of encephalopathy) at the 90 μg/m2/day dose level, 
60 μg/m2/day was established as the maximum tolerated dose in this study.  
Study MT103-202: 
Study MT103-202 was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study designed to investigate the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of blinatumomab in adult subjects with MRD following established 
standard induction/consolidation therapy of B-precursor ALL. The study included a Simon’s 2-stage 
design and a run-in dose-finding part. The primary endpoint was MRD response rate defined by the 
incidence of MRD negativity within 4 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab.

During the run-in dose finding part of the study, subjects (n = 21) received blinatumomab at a dose of 
15 μg/m²/day cIV for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks treatment-free (1 cycle was 6 weeks). The 
blinatumomab dose was increased to 30 μg/m²/day cIV for subjects who did not achieve a reduction in 
MRD level by ≥1 log unit. Subjects achieving MRD response were permitted to receive 3 additional 
consolidation cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. Subjects who showed neither MRD progression 
nor response were allowed to receive up to 7 cycles of blinatumomab (up to a maximum of 10 cycles). 
Following the last treatment cycle, subjects were assessed at every 6 weeks until disease progression 
but not longer than 5 years after the end of the last cycle.  
The majority of subjects (60%; 12/20) were female, Caucasian (100%; 20/20), with translocations of 
rearrangements of immunoglobulin / TCR genes (65%; 13/20). Overall, 45% (9/20) of subjects were 
> 60 years of age.  
Blinatumomab induced MRD responses within 1 treatment cycle in 80% of subjects with MRD+ B-
precursor ALL. By dose cohort, MRD response was achieved in 88% (15/17) of responders who 
received a constant dose of 15 μg/m2/day (all occurred after the first cycle) and in 33% (1/3) of non-
responders in the first cycle after dose increase to 30 μg/m2/day. The median duration of MRD 
response was 107 days.  
Blinatumomab showed a manageable toxicity profile within the dose range tested.  
Study MT 103-206: 
This was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, exploratory study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of blinatumomab in 36 adult subjects with relapsed and/or refractory B-precursor ALL (R/R 
ALL). Patients eligibility was based on ≥ 18 years of age with B-precursor ALL relapsed after at least 
induction and consolidation or having refractory disease with > 5% blasts in bone marrow, ECOG 
performance status ≤ 2, life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks, who did not have autologous hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 6 weeks prior to start of blinatumomab treatment, allogeneic 
HSCT within 3 months prior to start of blinatumomab treatment, or previous treatment with 
blinatumomab. The primary study endpoint was the rate of CR/CRh* within 2 cycles of blinatumomab 
treatment. In this study, subjects were initially enrolled at a dose of 15 μg/m2/day; however, to reduce 
first dose effects on safety, the next cohort was enrolled at 5 μg/m2/day for the first 7 days and 15 
μg/m2/day for the remaining 3 weeks of cycle 1 (a cycle was 4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off) and 
received 15 μg/m2/day for the whole duration of subsequent cycles. As this dosing was tolerated, a 
third cohort was enrolled at 5 μg/m2/day for the first 7 days, 15 μg/m2/day for the subsequent 7 days 
and 30 μg/m2/day for the remaining 2 weeks of cycle 1 and the whole duration of subsequent cycles 
(5-15-30 μg/m2/day).  
There were 36 subjects treated in this study (15 μg/m2/day, n = 7; 5-15 μg/m2/day, n = 23; 5-15-
30 μg/m2/day, n = 6). The majority of subjects in the study were white (97.2%) and men (61%), with 
a median age of 31.5 years (range 18 to 77 years). Most subjects (92%) had relapsed disease (8% 
had primary refractory disease) with a single relapse prior to study entry (64%).  
The overall CR/CRh* rate within the first 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab was 69% (25/36 
subjects; 95% CI: 52, 84). With the regimen of 5 to 15 μg/m²/day, the CR/CRh* rate was 69.6% (16 
out of 23 subjects: 10 CR [43.5%]; 6 CRh* [26.1%]). Blinatumomab showed a clinically manageable 
toxicity profile.

23. Previous treatment with blinatumomab 
Treatments 
Subjects received from 1 to 5 cycles of blinatumomab as a continuous intravenous (cIV) infusion at an 
initial dose of 9 µg/day for the first 7 days of cycle 1.   
Starting at week 2, the dose was escalated to the target dose of 28 µg/day and continued at that dose 
for the rest of cycle 1 and for all subsequent cycles.  A cycle consisted of a cIV infusion of 
blinatumomab at a constant flow rate over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of 2 weeks.   
The rationale for dose selection was based on the data from the clinical trial MT103-206 in adult 
patients with relapsed/refractoryB-precursor ALL and supportive data from further studies with 
blinatumomab. In particular, a favourable safety profile with a high degree of clearance of bone 
marrow disease was observed in patients with relapsed NHL at a dose of 15 μg/m²/day (trial MT103-
104); a favourable safety profile with a high MRD-response rate was observed in adult patients with 
MRD positive ALL at a dose of 15 μg/m²/day (trial MT103-202); and an improved safety profile at a 
starting dose of 5 μg/m²/day with escalation to 15 μg/m²/day after one week as compared with a 
constant dosing of 15 μg/m²/day, and a similarly high hematological CR rate in both dose cohorts was 
observed in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL (trial MT103-206). Nine (9) μg/day for the first 
seven days of the first cycle, followed by 28 μg/day for the remaining 21 days of the cycle and the 
following cycles (each cycle consisting of four weeks of cIV followed by two weeks of rest from 
treatment) corresponds to 5μg/m2/day, and 15μg/m2/day, respectively. 
Subjects who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with partial haematological 
recovery (CRh*) within 2 cycles of treatment were permitted to receive up to 3 additional cycles of 
consolidation therapy or proceed to allogeneic HSCT.  
The core study duration consisted of a screening period of up to 3 weeks followed by a treatment 
period of up to 30 weeks, followed by an end of core study visit 30 days after the end of the last cycle. 
Following the end-of-core study visit, follow-up visits occurred at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after 
the start of treatment.  After 24 months (or after HSCT), hematological relapse and survival 
information was gathered by phone/mail every 6 months until death or at least 3 years after treatment 
start, whichever occurred earlier.  Subjects who discontinued prematurely, had no response, or had 
hematological relapse were immediately entered into the efficacy and/or survival follow-up period.   
Subjects experiencing a haematological relapse during the follow-up period could receive an additional 
3 cycles of blinatumomab during a re-treatment period.  Thus, the maximum possible exposure was 
8 complete cycles. 
The study Schema is presented in Figure 8.

Prior and concomitant therapy: 
During the screening period, dexamethasone (10 mg/m2/day) may have been administered for up to 5 
days to prevent cytokine release and other events such as infusion reactions and fever (i.e., 
prephase).  This dose may have been increased to 24 mg/day if clinically indicated.  Dexamethasone 
prephase was required during screening if the proportion of blasts was > 50% or if peripheral blood 
blast count was  15,000/L.  Prephase was recommended if lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) indicated 
rapidly progressing disease or if signs of extramedullary disease showed high tumor load.  In addition, 
administration of dexamethasone (20 mg IV) was mandatory for all subjects within 1 hour before the 
start of each cycle and within 1 hour before dose step for the prevention of acute reactions to 
blinatumomab.  Other premedication included mandatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prophylaxis 
consisting of intrathecal therapy according to the institution or national guidelines. 
During the treatment period, subjects received adequate hydration according to institutional 
guidelines.  In the case of neurologic events, dexamethasone should have been administered orally or 
IV at a dose of at least 3 x 8 mg/day; this dose should then have been reduced step-wise over the 
next 4 days.  If a seizure occurred, then anticonvulsant treatment at therapeutic doses (e.g., 
phenytoin or levetiracetam) was to have been administered at the start of the next treatment cycle. 
For subjects after HSCT with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in their medical history, antifungal 
prophylactic treatment according to the national guidelines was mandatory.  Subjects at high risk of

Page 48/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection should have either been regularly tested by CMV polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) or treated prophylactically with a CMV treatment. 
Prohibited medications and therapies after the start of blinatumomab included any other anti-tumour 
therapy, cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational 
product, chronic systemic high dose corticosteroids, or any other immunosuppressive agents.  Non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should have been avoided for fever management in order to avoid 
endothelial stress. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the MT103-211 trial was to evaluate the efficacy of blinatumomab in subjects 
with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. 
Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the safety of blinatumomab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL and the evaluation of PK and PD data of blinatumomab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the CR/CRh* rate calculated as the number of subjects with either a 
CR or CRh* response within the first two treatment cycles divided by the total number of subjects in 
the analysis set. CR was defined as having ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no evidence of disease, 
and full recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets > 100,000/μL and absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) > 1,000/μL) and CRh* was defined as having ≤ 5% blasts in the bone marrow, no other 
evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets > 50,000/μL and ANC 
> 500/μL).   
Key secondary endpoints included best overall response within 2 cycles of blinatumomab, relapse-free 
survival (RFS defined as the time of the bone marrow aspiration when CR or CRh* was detected for the 
first time, until the date of documented hematological relapse, progressive disease, extramedullary 
relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier), time to hematological relapse (TTHR 
defined from the time of the bone marrow aspiration when CR or CRh* was detected for the first time 
until the date of documented hematological relapse, extramedullary relapse, or death due to disease 
progression whichever occurred earlier), overall survival (OS defined as the time from treatment start 
with blinatumomab in the first treatment cycle until the date of death from any cause) and proportion 
of treated subjects who underwent HSCT after treatment with blinatumomab and without other 
intermittent treatment of ALL. 
Important exploratory endpoints are rate of MRD response within 2 cycles of treatment (defined as 
MRD <1 x 10-4 measured by PCR) and MRD complete response within 2 cycles of treatment (i.e., no 
residual disease detected) within 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment. 
Sample size 
Sample size estimation for the primary efficacy endpoint “rate of subjects who achieve a CR/CRh* 
within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab” is based on a Simon 2-stage minimax design with the 
following parameters: p0 = 20%, p1 = 36%, a 1-sided type 1 error of 2.5% and a power of 80%. 
According to these parameters, 61 treated subjects (29 at stage 1 and 32 at stage 2) were needed to 
achieve 80% power. The study would have been stopped at stage 1 if fewer than 7 out of 29 subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 49/124 
 
 
 
 
 
were observed with CR/CRh* in stage 1. If at least 19 out of 61 subjects (approximately 31%) showed 
a CR/CRh* within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab at the end of stage 2, then H0 would have 
been rejected and further development of blinatumomab would have been considered warranted. This 
was used to propose the continuation of the trial via a third stage of recruitment. 
The clinical trial material from the market manufacturing process (CTM5) was to be introduced within 
the study. Clinical data generated from clinical trial material of different manufacturing processes 
(CTM4 and CTM5) were to be compared. It was planned to treat 50 patients with CTM5 in order to 
establish a reliable data base of safety and efficacy data for patients treated with CTM5. From a 
statistical perspective these 50 patients were to be analyzed as part of the third stage of the protocol.  
Subject enrolment was to have ended after the one hundred-fortieth subject had started treatment or 
after the fiftieth subject had started treatment with the clinical trial material from the market 
manufacturing process in the first treatment cycle, whichever occurred later. 
The combined sample of subjects from all 3 stages, of at least 140 subjects, was used to perform the 
primary statistical analysis. A sample size of 140 and a p1 = 45% would provide 96% power to reject 
H0 with a type I error of 2.5%. 
Upon completion of the third stage of the trial, a fourth stage of recruitment of subjects was initiated. 
For this cohort, 36 subjects were treated. Subjects in this cohort underwent additional MRI and 
neurological examinations. The neurological examination results were used to test for statistically 
significant changes from baseline by comparing the number of test items with at least 1 abnormal 
finding before blinatumomab treatment to the number of test items with at least 1 abnormal finding 
after blinatumomab treatment. Assuming a mean of 0 abnormal findings at baseline, a mean change 
from baseline of 0.5 (follow-up minus baseline), a standard deviation (SD) of the mean difference 
equal to 1.0, and a 1-sided type I error rate of 2.5%, the sample size of 30 subjects provided 
approximately 80% power to detect a mean change from baseline that was greater than 0, indicating 
an increase in abnormal neurologic examination results after blinatumomab use.  
The total sample size for enrolment into stages 1 through 3 was expected to be approximately 170 
treated subjects (it was expected to be 140 subjects at a minimum and could have been as high as 
190 subjects).  
Randomisation 
The study was a single-arm uncontrolled study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical analysis was based on the following study populations: 
Full analysis set (FAS): All patients who received any infusion of blinatumomab. This population 
includes the Additional Evaluation Cohort (patients enrolled under protocol version 4.0). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 50/124 
 
 
 
 
 
Primary analysis set (PAS): Patients from the first three stages of the study who received any infusion 
of blinatumomab. This represents all patients enrolled under protocol version 3.0 or earlier for whom 
the primary efficacy analysis has been defined. 
Efficacy set (EFS): All patients from the PAS for whom at least one evaluable response assessment is 
available after start of treatment, constitute the efficacy population.  
Per protocol set (PPS): All patients from the EFS who did not have any major relevant protocol 
violation which could have an impact on the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Responders: All patients who achieve a CR or CRh* within the first two cycles. This population has 
been used for the analysis of time to haematological relapse (duration of response) and relapse free 
survival. 
The primary analysis was based on the PAS. Sensitivity analyses were performed using efficacy set 
(EFS) and per protocol set (PPS).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was formally assessed twice: at the end of Simon stage-2 design 
(interim analysis) and the end of stage 3 (primary analysis). For the interim analysis, the following 
hypothesis was tested using the exact binomial test on a 2.5% significance level (1-sided hypothesis): 
H0: π ≤  20% versus H1: π ≥  36% 
The null hypothesis (H0) was rejected if at least 19 of 61 subjects responded to treatment. 
For the primary analysis at the end of stage 3 (after response assessments from the first 2 cycles of 
treatment were available for all PAS subjects) the following hypothesis was tested using the exact 
binomial test on a 2.5% significance level (1-sided hypothesis): 
H0: π ≤  30% versus H1: π > 30% 
This constituted the main analysis in the subject population studied. 
With current salvage chemotherapy, CR rate is low (20% to 30%) in subjects in first salvage with short 
duration (< 1 year) of first remission, subjects relapsed after first salvage, or subjects aged 60 years 
and older, thus the upper limit of this range (i.e., 30%) was chosen for the H0 rate in this hypothesis 
(Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2010).

Table 13. Best Response During Core Study 
In patients with non-CNS/non-testes extramedullary disease (defined as at least 1 lesion ≥ 1.5 cm) at 
screening (N = 8/189) clinical response rates (25% [95% CI 3.2-65.1] were lower compared with 
patients with no evidence of extramedullary disease (N=181, 43.6% [95%CI 36.3 - 51.2]) (Figure  9). 
Patients with the highest tumour burden as measured by the percentage of bone marrow blast cells at 
baseline (≥ 90%) still had a clinically meaningful response with a CR/CRh* rate of 21.6% (CI 12.9 – 
32.7) (Figure 9). Patients with low tumour burden (< 50%) responded best to blinatumomab 
treatment with CR/CRh* rate of 72.9% (CI 59.7 – 83.6).

Secondary endpoint: Relapse-free Survival 
For the PAS, the median relapse-free survival was 5.9 months (95% CI: 4.8, 8.3), with a median 
observation time of 8.9 months. Thirty-seven subjects (45.1%; 37/82) were censored for not having 
an event (i.e., in remission).

Secondary endpoint: Time to Haematological Relapse (Duration of Response) 
Time to hematological relapse (TTHR) was measured only for subjects in remission (CR/CRh*). The 
median TTHR for subjects who achieved CR/CRh* during the core study was 6.7 months (95% CI:  
5.1, NE). The median observation time was 8.0 months. Of the subjects who achieved a CR/CRh* 
during the core study, 45.1% (37/82) of subjects were in remission at the time of the data cut off 
(censored). For subjects who achieved CR within the first 2 cycles of treatment (N = 63), the median 
time to hematological relapse was 7.7 months (95% CI: 5.4, NE). For subjects who achieved CRh* 
within the first 2 cycles (N = 18), the median time to hematological relapse was 5.0 months (95% CI: 
1.4, NE) (data not shown).

Secondary  endpoint  :  Proportion  of  subjects  who  received  an  allogenic  haematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplant during blinatumomab induced remission 
All subjects who achieved CR/CRh* were considered eligible for allogeneic HSCT for analysis purposes.  
Among these subjects, 39.5% (32/81; 95% CI:  28.8, 51) received an allogeneic HSCT without any 
other subsequent anti-leukemic medication (excluding conditioning regimens). Of these 32 subjects, 
28 subjects had been in CR during the first 2 cycles of treatment, and 4 had been in CRh*.  This 
corresponds to an HSCT rate of 44.4% (95%CI 31.9% to 57.5%) and 22.2% (95%CI 6.4% to 47.6%) 
for subjects who achieved CR and CRh* during the first 2 treatment cycles, respectively.  
In addition to the 32 subjects who received allogeneic HSCT during a CR/CRh* response, 5 subjects 
received allogeneic HSCT after a bone marrow response (blast-free hypoplastic), though the majority 
of these subjects reported receiving subsequent therapies between blinatumomab and HSCT, and 10 
subjects went on to HSCT without achieving or maintaining remission: 5 of these subjects had a 
relapse after blinatumomab-induced remission and went to HSCT after other anti-leukemia therapy; 5 
subjects were refractory to blinatumomab and went to HSCT after receiving other anti-leukemia 
therapy. These subjects are not included in the transplant rate attributed to blinatumomab.  
The 100-day post-HSCT mortality rate (relative to transplant date) for the 32 subjects who underwent 
HSCT in blinatumomab remission was 11.3% (95% CI: 0.0, 23.4). The survival rate was 88.7% at day 
100 after transplant. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints: Rate of MRD Response During the First 2 Cycles of Treatment 
For subjects in remission (CR/CRh*) with a MRD assessment during the first 2 cycles (n=73), the MRD 
response rate was 82.2% (60/73), and the complete MRD response rate was 69.9% (51/73). For 
subjects who achieved CR within the first 2 treatment cycles, the MRD response rate was 86.2% 
(50/58) and the complete MRD response rate was 74.1% (43/58).  
For subjects who achieved CRh* within the first 2 treatment cycles and had a MRD assessment 
(n=15), the MRD response rate was 66.7% (10/15) and the complete MRD response was 53.3% 
(8/15). Among the 10 subjects who achieved blast-free hypoplastic marrow and had an MRD 
assessment, 5 (50%) had MRD response and 2 (20%) had complete MRD response. Overall, 65 
subjects achieved a MRD response; 63/65 achieved MRD during cycle 1, and 2/65 during cycle 2. 
Ancillary analyses 
An ad-hoc analysis was performed that examined prior subject exposure to authorised agents and 
response to blinatumomab.  Each authorised agent had been used in the vast majority of subjects.  
Response rates (CR/CRh*) were consistent regardless of exposure; no prior therapy failure appeared 
to generate resistance to blinatumomab. Further, out of 105 subjects that were refractory to their 
most recent regimen before entering the study (i.e., remission was not achieved), 42 of these subjects 
(40%) achieved CR/CRh* with blinatumomab.  CR+CRh seem to be consistent regardless of exposure.

Ad-hoc RFS analyses were performed for subjects achieving CR/CRh* who had MRD assessments 
(subjects without MRD assessments were excluded).  When subjects were stratified by MRD response 
(MRD-positive or MRD-negative, n = 73), the median RFS for responders (CR/CRh*) who were MRD-
negative was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.5, 10.1) (n = 60) and for those who were MRD-positive was 2.3 
months (95% CI: 1.2, not estimable [NE]) (n = 13).  For subjects who had a best response of CR 
during the first 2 cycles, median RFS was more than 5 months longer for subjects who were MRD-
negative (7.7 months [95% CI:  5.4, NE]) (n = 50) compared with subjects who were MRD-positive 
(2.4 months [95% CI:  1.4, NE]) (n = 8).  For subjects who had a best response of CRh* during the 
first 2 cycles, median RFS was 5.4 months (95% CI:  1.4, NE) (n = 10) in subjects who were MRD-
negative compared with 1.2 months (95% CI:  0.1, NE) (n = 5) in subjects who were MRD-positive 
(data not shown).   
Updated RFS estimates were submitted for subjects eligible for HSCT (who achieved complete 
remission/ complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CR/CRh*]) and who did not 
undergo transplant. The median RFS for the subjects in the FAS (cut-off date 15 July 2015) was 4.2 
months (95% CI: 2.7, 6.2).  The RFS rate (95%CI) at 12 months was 0.204 (0.111, 0.316) and at 24 
months was 0.151 (0.068, 0.265).  Three subjects had reached 24 months of RFS by the snapshot 
date (15 July 2015).  A total of 46 (79.3%) subjects relapsed, 3 subjects died, and 9 (15.5%) subjects 
were censored (still alive) at the data cut-off. 
Overall survival (OS) estimates were submitted for subjects eligible HSCT (who achieved complete 
remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh*) during the core study) 
and who did not undergo transplant. The median OS for the 58 subjects (cut-off date 15 July 2015) 
was 11.4 months (95% CI: 9.0, 19.0).  The OS rate (95%CI) at 12 months was 0.470 (CI: 0.336, 
0.593) and at 24 months was 0.309 (CI: 0.186, 0.441) i.e., it is estimated that 47% of subjects would 
be alive at 12 months and 31% would be alive at 24 months.  Eleven subjects had reached 24 months 
of follow-up by the snapshot date of 15 July 2015.  Of the 58 subjects who did not receive HSCT during 
remission, 40 (69.0%) subjects died and 18 (31.0%) subjects were censored (did not have a relapse).

A pooled analysis of studies MT103-206 and MT103-21 has been submitted. In this analysis, the rate 
of CR/CRh* during the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment was 42.9% (84/196; 95%CI: 35.8, 
50.1). The rate of CR/CRh* during the first 2 cycles of study treatment was analysed by key subgroups 
related to baseline demographics and disease-related characteristics. Across the baseline demographic

subgroups of sex, race, geographic region, and age, the rate of CR/CRh* remained consistent with the 
overall analysis (data not shown). 
Response associated with blinatumomab in treatment after late relapse 
The CR/complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh*) response rate was 88.9% (8/9) 
for subjects who were treated with blinatumomab after late relapse with 62.5% (6/9) achieving MRD 
response and 37.5 % (3/9) undergoing allogeneic HSCT after treatment with blinatumomab. The 
median overall survival (OS) was 17.7 months (CI 3.1 – not estimable). 
In Study MT103-206, all subjects (6/6; 100%) had a late first relapse after a CR/CRh*. In Study 
MT103-211, 2 subjects (2/3; 66%) achieved a CR/CRh* while 1 subject did not.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Data from the studies of relapsed/refractory ALL (MT103-211 and MT103-206) were pooled and 
stratified by elderly age class (for this analysis, data from the updated secondary analysis (10 
November 2014) of Study MT103-211 was used). The rate of complete remission/complete remission 
with partial hematological recovery (CR/CRh*) within the first 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment is

Study MT103-206  
Study MT103-206 was an open label, multicenter, exploratory phase II study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of blinatumomab in adult patients with relapsd/refractory b-precursor acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 
The study evaluated 36 patients  ≥ 18 years of age with B-precursor ALL relapsed after at least 
induction and consolidation or having refractory disease with >  5% blasts in bone marrow, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2, life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks, who did 
not have autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 6 weeks prior to start of 
blinatumomab treatment, allogeneic HSCT within 3 months prior to start of blinatumomab treatment, 
or previous treatment with blinatumomab. Fifteen of 36 (41.7%) patients had undergone allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) prior to receiving BLINCYTO.  
The complete remission/complete remission with partial haematological recovery (CR/CRh*) rate was 
69.4% (25 out of 36 patients: 15 [41.7%; 95% CI: 25.5% - 59.2%] CR; 10 [27.8%; 95% CI: 14.2% - 
45.2%] CRh*). In the elderly population (≥ 65 years of age) 4 of 5 patients (80.0%) achieved 
CR/CRh* within 2 treatment cycles (see section 4.8 for safety in elderly). Twenty-two of 36 (88%) 
patients with haematologic complete remission also had minimal residual disease (MRD) responses 
(defined as MRD by PCR < 1 x 10-4). The median duration of remission was 8.9 months, and the 
median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 7.6 months. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.8 months 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
Study 20120310 
An historical comparator study (Study 20120310) has been submitted to provide subject level 
historical data on haematological remission rates and survival among adult patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome negative relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL treated with standard of care 
chemotherapy.  The study cohort included data from 1139 patients (data was available for CRsg in 694 
patients, OS in 1112 patients, RFS in 108 patients, and HSCT in 808 patients) whose initial ALL 
diagnosis was after 01 January 1990. Two-thirds of the database patients were diagnosed after 2000. 
Patients included in the study’s weighted analysis had:  first relapse or salvage treatment after first 
remission duration of ≤  12 months, or refractory to initial treatment, or relapsed/refractory after first 
or later salvage (e.g., second or later relapse), or relapsed/refractory within 12 months of allogeneic 
HSCT. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the proportion of patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL who achieved haematological CRsg

following salvage treatment, excluding patients with first remission duration of > 12 months in first 
salvage (i.e., late first relapse). The overall CRsg rate, weighted to the MT103-211 study population, 
was 24% (95% CI: 20, 27).

Propensity score analysis  
The analyses were conducted on 3 analysis sets determined by each subject’s year of initial ALL 
diagnosis.  In the primary set, only subjects diagnosed on or after 01 January 2000 were included 
(approximately 67% of historical data included).  Sensitivity analyses (intended to examine differences 
in outcomes due to change of treatment protocols over time) included all subjects in historical data 
(from 1990 forward) and those diagnosed on or after 01 January 2002 (approximately 50% of 
historical data).  Data cutoffs later than 2002 were not used due to excessive attrition of subjects from 
the dataset which was considered prohibitive for the analysis. 
Table 27 summarises 8 common covariates between the two data sources and the degree of imbalance 
between them prior to the propensity score adjustments.  A summary of these same covariates after 
making propensity score adjustments is presented in Table 28.

cThe  number  of  salvage  therapies  includes  the  last  line  of  treatment,  which  is  blinatumomab  for  blinatumomab 
subjects. 
The primary method of analysis used stabilized Inverse Probability of Treatment Weights (sIPTW) to 
adjust for a subject’s propensity score in the analyses of OS and CR rates.  Side-by-side comparisons 
of the unadjusted and adjusted survival estimates from the Cox proportional hazards model for each 
treatment group are presented in Figure 11.  The hazard ratio and 95% CI from the primary 
comparison using the sIPTW was 0.64 (0.39 – 1.06), indicating a 36% reduction in the risk of death 
associated with blinatumomab treatment compared to standard-of-care. 
The majority of sensitivity analyses (4 out of 5 sensitivity analyses of the primary subgroup, 13 out of 
15 sensitivity analyses overall) resulted in hazard ratio confidence intervals that were completely below 
the reference value of 1.0.  The primary and sensitivity analyses of the primary subgroup (subjects 
diagnosed on or after 1 January 2000) differed in the handling of 3 blinatumomab subjects with 
outlying (very low) propensity scores and, therefore, very large weights.  The sensitivity approaches 
that either trim the weights of these 3 outlier subjects or exclude them altogether resulted in upper 
bounds to the confidence intervals that were below the reference value of 1.0 while the approaches 
that permitted these outlying weights to be used resulted in upper bounds just above 1.0.

Literature meta-analysis 
A Model-Based Meta-analysis (MBMA) (Mandema et al, 2011) was conducted to evaluate the 
proportion of CR, DCR, and OS in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL receiving existing salvage 
therapies using data from the literature. The MBMA dataset for Study 118427 was constructed based 
on a systematic review of all published English-language studies reporting on clinical outcomes in adult 
patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. 
In terms of prognostic factors, the analysis was based on the five key prognostic factors age, sex, 
remission duration (i.e., duration of remission following initial diagnosis) or ER, relapse in BM, and 
relapse in CNS to determine a Fielding risk score (RS) (Fielding et al, 2007). Additional covariates were 
incorporated using standard regression techniques. Heterogeneity was evaluated formally using mixed-
effects analyses by inclusion of a random effect to account for differences not explained by the fixed 
effects (i.e., prognostic/predictive factors, covariates). In addition, heterogeneity due to differences in 
subject populations and differences in study design and/or analysis were evaluated qualitatively. 
Following development and evaluation of the models described above, simulations were conducted to 
project the proportion of CR, median DCR, and median OS for a R/R ALL subject population similar to 
the subjects enrolled in Study MT103-211. 
Results from 24 studies (2622 subjects) included in this meta-analysis showed a mean percentage of 
CR across studies of 36%, with a trend toward higher CR rates as patients in 2nd or greater salvage 
and Fielding risk score decreased. Only 8/24 studies provided information with respect to duration of 
CR (DCR): median DCR was 4.8 months, and the 12-month DCR rate was 12.6%. Eighteen out of 24 
studies were informative with respect to OS: median OS was 5.09 months, and the 12- and 24-month 
OS rate were 25.1% and 11% respectively.  
The CR (including Fielding RS and percentage of subjects in 2nd or greater salvage), DCR (including 
Fielding RS), and OS (including the covariates Fielding RS, post relapse alloHSCT and percent of 
subjects in second or greater salvage) models were used to project proportion of CR, DCR, and OS for 
subjects receiving existing salvage therapies with a covariate distribution that mimics that observed in 
Study MT103-211, accounted for uncertainty in model parameters, and explored the effect of 
heterogeneity.  
Assessment report

Page 72/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the OS analysis, including the effect of post relapse alloHSCT and second or greater salvage reduced 
the between studies variability from 26.1% to 14.4%, a reduction of 70% in the variance. In addition, 
increasing the Fielding RS from 1 to 3 was associated with a 300% increase in the OS hazard. Also, 
there was a 65% (95% CI: 55% to 75%) increase in the OS hazard for a population with 100% of 
subjects in 2nd or greater salvage, relative to a population with no subjects in 2nd or greater salvage. 
Lastly, relative to a population with no post-relapse alloHSCT, there was a 41% (95% CI: 34% to 
48%) reduction in the OS hazard for a population with 100% of subjects with post-relapse alloHSCT. 
For a subject population with similar characteristics to that enrolled in Study MT103-211, the model-
based projection (accounting for heterogeneity) for median OS was 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.0 to 4.7 
months). The projected median CR was 12.1% (4.1%, 34.1%) and the projected median DCR was 4.9 
months (95% CI: 2.5 to 9.2).

2.7.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Blinatumomab was evaluated in an open-label, multicentre, single-arm phase II study (MT103-211) of 
189 patients. Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age with Philadelphia chromosome-negative relapsed 
or refractory B-precursor ALL (relapsed with first remission duration of  12 months in first salvage, or

relapsed or refractory after first salvage therapy, or relapsed within 12 months of allogeneic HSCT, and 
had  10% blasts in bone marrow) (SmPC, section 5.1). The inclusion/exclusion criteria adopted in the 
MT103-211 trial were adequate to define a high risk adult ALL population characterized by limited 
therapeutic options and dismal prognosis.  
Among treated patients, the median age was 39 years (range: 18 to 79 years, including 25 patients ≥  
65 years of age), 64 of 189 (33.9%) had undergone HSCT prior to receiving blinatumomab and 32 of 
189 (16.9%) had received more than 2 prior salvage therapies (SmPC, section 5.1). Due to strict 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, study MT103-211 was not characterized by major baseline unbalances. The 
gender unbalancing (M/F: 119/70) observed in study MT103-211 is expected, since ALL is slightly 
more common in males than females. 
A supportive additional phase II study (MT103-206) conducted in 36 adults with relapsed/refractory B-
precursor ALL was also submitted.  
During the initial evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection on the limited number of patients (6) 
in late first relapse that were included in the supportive study MT103-206. In addition, patients in late 
first relapse were supposed to be excluded from the pivotal and the confirmatory trials.  From a clinical 
point of view the late first-relapse patient population is very heterogeneous, and it should be 
considered that a significant portion of patients may be intolerant to additional multi agent 
chemotherapy, either due to age, comorbidity or long-lasting treatment toxicity. On one hand, elderly 
patients are usually not eligible to intensive chemotherapy and/or HSCT, and their life-expectancy is 
understandably very limited. On the other hand, younger, fit patients can be treated (or re-treated) 
with intensive polychemotherapy regimens designed according to paediatric protocols. Gokbuget et al. 
(Blood 2012) showed that when late first-relapsed patients are treated with paediatric-like 
polichemotherapy regimens usually used in de-novo induction (i.e. GMALL protocols), results were 
comparable to that observed with blinatumomab (CR rate was approximately 88% [24 out of 27 
treated patients]). In comparison, re-challenge with the same intensive regimen in early first-relapsed 
patients resulted in a CR rate of approximately 29%. Based on the available information from studies 
MT103 206 and MT103-211, the response rate (CR/CRh) was 8/9 (88.8%) in late first relapse patients, 
with 5/9 (55.5%) of MRD responses. The demonstrated ability to achieve minimum residual disease-
negative responses after blinatumomab treatment may benefit the outcome to the patient after 
subsequent allogeneic HSCT. Therefore, the efficacy can be considered established in this subgroup. 
However, in view of the limited data, further efficacy data in the late first relapse population will be 
collected as part of the planned post-approval safety registry study (20150136, submitted as part of 
the annexes to the RMP). 
Study 20150136, as proposed by the Applicant, is considered appropriate to provide the requested 
data, since the clinical endpoints for efficacy (CR and CR/CRh*/CRi rates, proportion of subjects 
receiving HSCT, 100-day mortality, RFS, OS, and MRD response within first two cycles of treatment) 
and safety  proposed for this study are endorsed. However, considering the hypothesized sample size 
(150-250 patients), a sufficient number of late first-relapsed patients will be eventually included in 
study 20150136. The Applicant has amended the protocol synopsis of the post-marketing study 
20150136 and anticipated that at least 40 late first relapse patients could potentially be recruited. This 
target number of this subpopulation will be evaluated during the recruitment period e.g. interim 
analyses points, allowing necessary recruitment strategy to ensure the target number of this last first 
relapse patients is reached. Furthermore, as requested, study data will be analyzed not only for the 
whole population, but also be stratified by subpopulations of interest including late first-relapse 
patients (see conclusions on clinical efficacy).

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The overall CR/CRh* rate obtained with blinatumomab in pivotal study MT103-211 after the first two 
cycles (81/189, 42.9%) is significant in relapsed/refractory adult ALL setting. Based on recent 
literature data (Thomas DA et al, Cancer 1999; Fielding AK et al, Blood 2007; O'Brien S et al, Cancer 
2008; Tavernier E et al, Leukemia 2007; Oriol A et al, Haematologica 2010; Gökbuget N et al, Blood 
2012 and Kako S et al, Br J Haematol 2013), in a relapsed/refractory adult ALL setting, the overall 
expected CR (plus CRi/CRp/CRh*) rate with conventional chemotherapy hardly exceeds 30% to 45% in 
first relapse, and 18% to 23% in second or subsequent relapses. The clinical importance of this result 
is further assessed when CR and CRh* rates after 2 cycles are analysed separately, since CRs (67/82) 
significantly prevailed over CRh* (15/82). Moreover, a 51.9% rate of CR/CRh* plus aplastic bone 
marrow response was reported in this study; this result is considered of importance since, in current 
clinical practice, absence of blasts in peripheral blood and bone marrow, especially if supported by MRD 
negativity, is often deemed adequate to proceed to a potentially curative HSCT. Indeed, the high rates 
of MRD response in patients clinically responding to blinatumomab are remarkable. A deep response is 
assessed in 86.2% of patients reaching a CR, in 66.7% of patients reaching a CRh* and in 50% of 
patients with a blast-free hypoplastic bone marrow.  
The median RFS was 5.9 months (95% CI: 4.8 to 8.3 months), with a median observation time of 8.9 
months. The updated data from study MT103-211 showed that the median RFS observed in patients 
considered not eligible to HSCT was 4.2 months (95% CI 2.7, 6.2). This result is very similar to that 
observed in historical series, even though in study 20120310, transplantation was an option. 
Moreover, as reported by Gökbuget et al. (Blood 2012), the 12-month OS for adult patients with 
relapsed ALL not eligible to transplantation was 0%. Thus, the 15% 24-month RFS obtained with 
blinatumomab is considered meaningful in this high risk population. 
The OS of patients treated with blinatumomab in study MT103-211 was 6.1 months (median 
observation time 9.8 months), with a 6- and 12-month survival probability of 50% and 28% 
respectively. The 12- and 24-month OS rates reported for patients who achieved CR/CRh* after 
treatment with blinatumomab but who were not considered eligible to transplant were 47% and 
30.9%. These results are considered significant, since in the historical control 20120310 the reported 
12-month OS rate in a patient population similar to that enrolled in pivotal study MT103-211 was 15% 
(95% CI :13-18%) despite transplant was an option, and, in a recent paper by Gökbuget et al. (Blood 
2012), no patient without SCT survived more than 1 year after relapse. Overall, the impact of 
blinatumomab on the OS of patients not eligible to HSCT is considered meaningful in this poor 
prognosis population.  
Results of the primary and sensitivity OS analyses per propensity score primary and sensitivity 
analyses also indicate that most of the analyses resulted in HR CIs that were completely below 1, 
suggesting an OS improvement with blinatumomab. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA   
The absence of a control arm in study MT103-211 impairs a clear assessment of the benefit of 
blinatumomab compared to conventional chemotherapy in all the relapsed/refractory ALL settings. To 
further support the results obtained in study MT103-211, the Applicant provided an historical study 
and a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA). Based on the observed efficacy and these additional 
analyses, a clinical benefit for blinatumomab, can be considered established, but a confirmation from a 
phase III comparative study is needed in order to better quantify the magnitude of the effect, in

particular with respect to time-related endpoints. The Applicant has proposed to submit the final CSR 
for study 00103311 (TOWER), an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open-label study designed to 
investigate the efficacy of blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in adult subjects with 
relapsed/refractory b-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) to meet this requirement. 
Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a condition to the marketing authorisation in Annex II for the 
submission of the ongoing study 00103311 (TOWER). 
2.7.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Data from pivotal study MT103-211 showed a clinically significant response rate to blinatumomab in a 
high risk population of relapsed/refractory adult ALL patients for whom results obtained with 
conventional chemotherapy are usually unsatisfactory. These results are further supported by the high 
rates of negative MRD responses observed throughout all the clinical studies, and by the estimation of 
clinical responses obtained with conventional chemotherapy as provided by the historical comparator 
study 20120310 and by a model-based meta-analysis.  
However efficacy results from direct comparison with chemotherapy regimens are needed in order to  
better quantify the magnitude of the effect.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): Final Study report for Study 00103311(TOWER): A phase 3, 
randomized, open-label study to investigate the efficacy of blinatumomab versus standard of care 
chemotherapy in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory b-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia 
(ALL).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS): Study 20150136: An observational study of 
blinatumomab safety and effectiveness, utilisation, and treatment practices. 
2.8.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 475 patients were exposed to blinatumomab in seven studies (MT103-211 (pivotal study), 
MT103-206, MT103-205, MT103-202, MT103-203, MT103-104, MT103-208 – see overview of clinical 
studies under clinical efficacy). Safety of blinatumomab in adult Philadelphia-negative 
relapsed/refractory ALL population were available from 2 phase II studies in 225 subjects: pivotal 
study MT103-2011 (n=189) with fixed daily dose regimen (9-28 µg/day) and supportive study MT103-
206 (n=36) with BSA based dose regimen allocated to receive either 15 µg/m2/d (n=7), or 5-15 
µg/m2/d (n=23) or 5-15-30 µg/m2/d (n=6). 
The safety assessment focuses mainly on data from the pivotal Phase II study MT103-211 where 
189 adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL received blinatumomab as monotherapy at the dose 
regimen proposed for this indication.

a For data summarization, the core study was defined as the time period from the first infusion of study drug up to end of core visit; 
end  of  core  visits  were  scheduled  to  be  30  days  after  last  dose  of  initial  treatment  period,  although  subjects  may  have  had  the 
visit earlier if discontinued from study. 
Patients who received ≥1 dose of blinatumomab treatment were included in the safety analyses. The 
clinical data cut-off date for study MT103-211 was 10 October 2013. Serious adverse event data from 
the sponsor safety database were evaluated with a database cut-off date of 30 March 2014. 
A summary of blinatumomab exposure in the two adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies is presented 
below.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
Treatment-related TEAE were defined as TEAE deemed by the investigators as related to 
blinatumomab. In order to provide a consistent approach to determine which adverse events were 
possible ADR in this single arm, pivotal study (MT103-211), an algorithm was used to define the 
threshold criteria across the TEAEs as following: 
- any treatment-emergent adverse event with a subject incidence  10%, or 
- any grade  3 treatment-emergent adverse event with a subject incidence  5%  
- treatment-emergent adverse events that did not meet the above incidence thresholds but were 
considered biologically plausible and clinically meaningful. 
Adverse drug reactions are listed in the table below with their respective frequencies.

Adverse events of interest 
The following adverse events were further analysed as considered adverse events of interest 
(according to the CIOMS definition):  
Neurological adverse events 
The analysis of neurological events was based on a search of sponsor predefined clinically appropriate 
High-Level group terms from the SOCs Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders.  
In pivotal study MT103-211, 98 subjects (51.9%) experienced 237 neurologic and psychiatric TEAEs. 
The majority of neurologic events were clinically reversible (74.5%) and resolved following interruption 
of treatment. The reported TEAEs represented a wide spectrum of neurologic adverse events including 
mainly tremor (33/189, 17.5%), dizziness (26/189, 13.8%), confusional state (N=14, 7.4%), 
encephalopathy (10/189, 5.3%), ataxia and somnolence (9 for each, 4.8%), aphasia, disorientation, 
mental status changes and paraesthesia (7 for each, 3.7%). 24 subjects (12.7%) experienced grade  
3 neurologic events. 39 serious neurological TEAEs were reported for 31 subjects (16.4%), of which 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 84/124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encephalopathy, tremor, and confusional state were reported in 5 subjects for each. Grade 3 (CTCAE 
version 4.0) or higher (severe or life-threatening) neurologic events following initiation of 
blinatumomab administration included encephalopathy, seizures, speech disorders, disturbances in 
consciousness, confusion and disorientation, and coordination and balance disorders. No fatal 
neurologic events were reported at the time of the data cut-off date. 
The majority of events occurred during the first cycle and the median time to onset of first neurologic 
event was 9 days from the start of blinatumomab treatment, while the median time to onset of first 
grade  3 neurologic event was 16.5 days. The neurological AEs were resolved in 73 subjects 
(unresolved for 24 subjects and 1 unknown), with a median time of 5 days to resolution of the event of 
any grade and 3 days of grade ≥3 events. Approximately 5% (N=9) of subjects experienced neurologic 
AEs that led to permanent study drug discontinuation, of which encephalopathy accounted for almost 
half of the discontinuation events.  
Treatment emergent neurologic events were updated in the secondary analysis clinical study report 
(CSR) for this population of adult subjects with refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL). 7 additional subjects experienced grade  3 neurologic events. Two subjects experienced fatal 
neurologic events (fatal encephalopathy). 
A summary of treatment-emergent and grade  3 treatment-emergent neurologic events by 
pre-blinatumomab intrathecal chemotherapy for Study MT103-211 was also provided.  The subject 
incidences of treatment-emergent neurologic events were similar for subjects who received intrathecal 
chemotherapy (51.3%) compared with subjects who had not received intrathecal chemotherapy 
(54.1%).  The subject incidence of grade  3 neurologic was higher for subjects who had not received 
intrathecal chemotherapy (21.6%) compared with subjects who had intrathecal therapy (10.5%); 
however, confidence interval overlapped indicating no meaningful difference.  Three subjects had > 1 
administration of anti-leukemic prophylaxis.  No data are available for cranial radiation.  
To further understand factors associated with treatment-emergent neurotoxicity logistic regression 
analyses were conducted. Only subjects with platelets < 50,000/L at baseline or a medical history of 
neurologic events had a statistically significant higher subject incidence of treatment-emergent and 
treatment-emergent grade  3 neurologic events. The multivariate and univariate analysis data for 
subjects with a history of neurologic events did not show any specific medical history terms which were 
predictive of treatment-emergent neurologic events in the pivotal phase 2 study (MT103-211). An 
additional subset analysis showed that subjects with prior neurologic events were at higher risk of 
treatment-emergent neurologic events (65.2% vs 44.7%) and grade ≥3 treatment-emergent 
neurologic events (19.7% vs 8.9%) as compared to subjects without prior neurologic events. 
Encephalopathy 
Two subjects died due to fatal encephalopathy events after the cut-off date in the pivotal study 
(encephalopathy and metabolic encephalopathy 1 for each). For one patient who died 39 days post-
treatment initiation and 4 days after the onset of encephalopathy, it was considered related to 
blinatumomab by investigator. According to narratives, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 
lumbar puncture was performed and the cause of the fatal encephalopathy was not established.  
Patients with brain MRI/CT findings consistent with leukoencephalopathy experienced concurrent 
serious adverse events including confusional state, tremor, cognitive disorder, encephalopathy, and 
convulsion. Leukoencephalopathy has also been reported. Although there is a potential for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 85/124 
 
 
 
 
 
development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), no case of PML has been reported 
in the pivotal study. 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
A total of 33 TEAEs of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm were reported for 24 of 189 
subjects (12.7%) in study MT103-211, all related to blinatumomab and events resolved for 21 
subjects. Among the 24 patients, 11.6% (22/189) of subjects experienced cytokine release syndrome 
(preferred term) and 1.1% (2/189) of subjects experience cytokine storm (preferred term). 3 subjects 
experienced grade 3 CRS events which were resolved for all 3 subjects. Serious CRS reactions were 
reported in 0.5% of patients with a median time to onset of 2 days. No subject experienced an event 
of CRS that led to study drug permanent discontinuation. Blinatumomab infusion was interrupted for 3 
subjects (1.6%) experienced CRS. The median time to onset of events was 2 days. No fatal events of 
CRS were reported.  
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
In study MT103-211, TLS were reported as TEAE for 4.2% (8/189) of subjects, one of them had a 
serious TLS event related to blinatumomab. All TLS occurred during cycle 1, with 6 of 8 occurred 
during the first 8 days after the start of treatment. TLS resolved for 6 of 8 subjects, and unresolved 
(ongoing) for 2 others. The majority of events (5 of 8) were grade 1 or 2. Of 3 subjects with grade 3 
events, 2 recovered from their TLS and 1 died due to cause other than TLS (i.e. sepsis). 1 subject 
interrupted his treatment; no permanent discontinuation due to TLS event was reported. No grade 4 or 
5 or fatal TLS were reported. 
The risk of TLS was analysed in patients with impaired renal function and/or hyperuricemia. Using a 
broad search strategy, 28.6% of all subjects had signs or symptoms suggestive of TLS in the pivotal 
study. With 8 patients with moderate renal impairment, TSL occurred in 37.5% (3/8) of subjects with 
moderate renal impairment (vs 29.9% 46/154 in subjects with normal renal function). The incidence of 
TLS grade ≥3, serious TLS or TLS leading to drug interruption was also higher in case of moderate 
renal impairment as compared with normal renal function (25.0% vs 8.4%, 25.0% vs 2.6% or 12.5% 
vs 0.6% respectively). 
Infection 
Life-threatening or fatal (grade ≥ 4), viral, bacterial, and fungal infections have been reported. In 
addition, reactivations of virus infection (e.g. Polyoma (BK)) have been observed. 
Of 189 subjects enrolled in study MT103-211, 119 subjects (63%) reported 252 TEAEs of infections. 
Pneumonia was the most common event, occurring in 18 subjects (9.5%), followed by sepsis in 13 
subjects (6.8%). A half of them (60/119) were serious and fatal infections occurred in 17 subjects 
(9.0%), sepsis was the most common fatal event. Overall, 5% of subjects had their infusions 
interrupted (N=9, 4.8%) or discontinued (N=10, 5.3%), primarily due to sepsis (N=4, 2.1%). Median 
time to onset of a first infection event was 18 days from the start of blinatumomab infusion (Q1:Q3; 
7.0, 45.0) in Study MT103-211. 
In study MT103-211, opportunistic infections (bacterial, viral, fungal) were observed in 16.9% 
(32/189) subjects, pneumonia fungal (N=4, 2.1%) and cytomegalovirus infection (N=3, 1.6%) were 
the most frequently reported events (in >2 subjects). Per investigator, opportunistic infections in 9 of 
32 subjects were treatment-related. 12 subjects (6.3%) experienced serious opportunistic infection

events with the most common of these events: Aspergillus infection and pneumonia fungal (N=2 for 
each).  
In study MT103-211, catheter site infections were reported in 9 subjects (4.8%), with device related 
infection (N=8), staphylococcal infection (N=3) and pseudomonas infections (N=1). Serious catheter 
site infections were reported in 7 subjects (3.7%), no fatal outcome was reported. Per investigators, 
none of any catheter site infection events was related to treatment. 
An analysis based on the EGOG PS at baseline was performed across 2 adult R/R ALL studies. Subjects 
with EGOG PS at baseline of 2 experienced a higher subject incidence of SAE in the Infections and 
Infestation SOC compared with subjects with ECOG PS < 2 (45.5% versus 30.4%), which was driven 
primarily by a higher subject incidence of pneumonia (9.1% versus 4.2%), sepsis (9.1% versus 3.7%), 
and respiratory failure (6.1% versus 0.5%) in subjects with ECOG PS  2. In addition, a univariate 
analysis of time to first onset of infections using Cox proportional hazard models revealed a higher rate 
of infections in subjects with ECOG PS of 2 (versus ECOG PS of 0, HR: 2.86 [1.72, 4.76], p < 0.001),  
50% central bone marrow blast infiltration (versus <25% bone marrow blast infiltration HR: 1.91 
[1.19, 3.07], p = 0.008), <50,000/µL platelets (versus  100,000/µL HR: 1.96 [1.26, 3.04], p = 
0.003) or <500/µl neutrophils at baseline (versus 1,000/µl, HR: 1.49 [1.05, 2.12], p = 0.027). 
Medication errors 
In the pivotal study, the subject incidence of treatment-emergent overdose events was 3.2% (6/189); 
overdose and accidental overdose (preferred terms) were reported at an incidence of 2.6% (5/189) 
and 1.1% (2/189), respectively. All overdose events were either grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. Four 
subjects had an overdose event during cycle 1 between day 1 and day 7, and 2 subjects had an 
overdose event during cycle 3 at day 4 or later. The 6 subjects experienced 7 events of overdose up to 
the cut-off date. 1 more SAE of overdose was reported between 11 October 2013 and 30 March 2014. 
Pyrexia of grade 1 or 2 was the only AE reported (3 of 7 subjects) in association with the overdose. All 
subjects recovered from their overdose SAE. 
Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS)  
In the pivotal study, one subject (0.5%; 1/189) reported a treatment-emergent event of capillary leak 
syndrome. The event was considered serious and related to blinatumomab treatment. Treatment-
emergent capillary leak syndrome occurred within 1 to 7 days during cycle 1 of treatment. The event 
was grade 4 in severity and resolved during the treatment period. Between 11 October 2013 and 30 
March 2014, no capillary leak syndrome events were reported. 
Infusion Reactions 
Of 189 subjects in pivotal study, 54 subjects (28.6%) reported 72 acute infusion reactions (onset 
within 48h post blinatumomab infusion with duration of ≤3 days), primarily due to pyrexia (N=42, 
22.2%), CRS (N=5, 2.6%) and hypotension (N=4, 2.1%). 7 subjects had grade 3 events which were 
all resolved. 2 serious infusion reaction were reported and considered related to blinatumomab. 2 
additional reversible SAE were reported later. Overall, at the cutoff date, severe infusion and 
hypersensitivity reactions were rare (3.7%) and all resolved. No life-threatening or fatal infusion 
reaction events were reported. After the cut-off date, serious infusion reactions, as pyrexia, were 
reported for 7 subjects. The infusion reactions were generally rapid, occurring within 48 hours after 
initiating infusion. However some patients reported delayed onset of infusion reactions or in later 
cycles.

Thromboembolic events (including DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation) 
In Study MT103-211, 20 subjects (10.6%) experienced thromboembolic events, primarily due to DIC 
(N=4), deep vein thrombosis and device occlusion (N=3 for each). Events were resolved for 11 of 
them (11/20, 55%). SAE were reported for 7 patients (3.7%), 1 subject died due to cerebral embolism 
which was considered unrelated to blinatumomab, since per investigator, this event in the brain was 
secondary to a cardiac thrombus.  
Cytopenias 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia: 
In study MT103-211, 42.9% (81 of 189) subjects experienced 126 TEAEs of neutropenia events, 51 of 
them were considered related to blinatumomab by investigators. Very common TEAEs by PT were 
febrile neutropenia (53/189, 28.0% of subjects having 68 AEs) and neutropenia (33, 17.5% subjects 
having 46 AEs), followed by neutrophil count decreased (7 subjects), neutropenic sepsis (2 subjects 
with 3 AEs), agranulocytosis and neutropenic colitis (1 for each). 25 (13.2%) subjects experienced at 
least 1 SAE of neutropenia events including febrile neutropenia (16 subjects), neutropenia (7 
subjects), neutropenic sepsis (2 subjects) and neutrophil count decreased (1 subject). 75 subjects 
(39.7%) reported ≥ grade 3 neutropenia events, with the very common events reported as febrile 
neutropenia (63 AEs reported for 48/189 subjects, grade 3 for 46 subjects et grade 4 for 2 other 
subjects) and neutropenia (42 AEs reported for 30/189 subjects, grade 3 for 9 subjects and grade 4 for 
21 of them). Of the 75 subjects who experienced ≥ grade 3 neutropenia events, events resolved for 54 
subjects (54/75; 72%) and events were unresolved for 9 subjects (9/75; 12%). According to 
investigators, no fatal treatment-emergent neutropenia events were reported, 10 subjects died due to 
causes other than neutropenia events and the outcome was unknown for 2 subjects. After cut-off 
dates, serious febrile neutropenia was reported for 4 subjects and serious neutropenia was reported for 
2 subjects between 11 October 2013 and 30 March 2014. 
In Study MT 103-211, the baseline median absolute neutrophil concentration was 1.1 x 109/L (range: 0 
to 22 x 109/L). The median changes in absolute neutrophils from baseline to the end of cycle 1, cycle 
2, and the core study were -0.5, 0.8, and 0.1 x 109/L, respectively. Comparing baseline to end of core 
study absolute neutrophil grade shifts (maximum grade for decreased values), there was an increased 
frequency of grade 4 (from 34.9% [66/189] to 62.4% [118/189]) absolute neutrophil values. 
Anaemia: 
In Study MT103-211, 38 of 189 (20.1%) subjects experienced 48 TEAEs of anaemia. 16 of 48 events 
experienced for 12 subjects were considered to be blinatumomab-related. 27 subjects reported 35 AEs 
≥grade 3 including 2 subjects with grade 4 anaemia; events were resolved for 14 of 27 subjects and 
unresolved for 11 subjects (unknown for 1). 1 subject experienced serious anaemia. No grade 5 or 
fatal anaemia was reported. 35 of 38 subjects who had at least 1 TEAE of anaemia reported events 
during cycle 1. The median changes in haemoglobin from baseline to the end of cycle 1, cycle 2, and 
the core study were -6.0, 9.5, and 5.0 g/L, respectively. 1.1% (2/189) of subjects had haemoglobin 
values that met the criteria for an AE.  
Similar rates and patterns of anaemia were reported in adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies (17.8%) 
and the program-wide pooled population (15.8%).

Thrombocytopenia:  
In Study MT103-211, 21 of 189 (11.1%) subjects experienced 29 platelet count abnormalities such as 
thrombocytopenia, 10 of them were considered related to blinatumomab. 16 subjects reported 24 
events ≥grade 3 including 14 subjects with grade 4. Events were resolved for 7 of 16 subjects with 
≥grade 3, unresolved for also 7 of them. None of serious or grade 5 thrombocytopenia was reported. 
Thrombocytopenia was reported during cycle 1 for almost all subjects (20 of 21) who had at least 1 
event.  
The median changes in platelet concentration from baseline (42.0 x 109/L) to the end of cycle 1, cycle 
2, and the core study were 14.5, 81.0, and 13.0 x 109/L. 4.2% (8/189) of subjects had decreased 
platelet values that met the criteria for an AE. 
Similar rates and patterns of thrombocytopenia were reported in adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies 
(12.4%) and the program-wide pooled population (15.4%), with 3.6% of subjects experienced the AEs 
of platelet count decreased in both datasets. 
Lymphopenia:  
In the pivotal study, the subject incidence of treatment-emergent lymphopenia was 1.1% (2/189). 
One subject experienced serious, grade 4 lymphopenia, which was considered related to 
blinatumomab. The subject recovered from the event. The subject incidence of treatment-emergent 
lymphocyte count decreased was 1.6% (3/189). All events were non-serious, grade 4, and considered 
related to blinatumomab. Five subjects had lymphopenia events of any grade; events resolved for 4 
subjects (80%; 4/5) and events were unresolved for 1 subject (20%; 1/5). Of 4 subjects that 
experienced ≥  grade 3 lymphonenia events, events resolved for 3 subjects (75%; 3/4), while the 
event was unresolved 1 subject (25%; 1/4). No fatal lymphopenia events were reported. Between 11 
October 2013 and 30 March 2014, no lymphopenia events were reported. 
Other Critical Toxicities 
QT Prolongation and other ECG abnormalities:  
No dedicated thorough QT studies were conducted. The QT/QTc prolongation was not investigated in 
Study MT103-211. However ECG monitoring (heart rate and ECG analysis) regarding potential QT/QTc 
prolongation was conducted in 62 subjects of protocols MT103-206 and MT103-203. Across the 2 adult 
relapsed/refractory ALL studies, one subject experienced a non-serious AE reported as 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged (by 130%) at 64 days post initiation of blinatumomab and resolved 14 
days later. The subject was also taking multiple concomitant medications including Ciprofloxacin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, bactrim, and furosemide, some of which are known to cause QT prolongation. All 
serious cardiac TEAEs were reported in subjects with a history of cardiac events or other concurrent 
events. One subject in the paediatric relapsed/refractory ALL population who experienced an event of 
atonic seizure had QTc interval increased (560ms).  
Nephrotoxicity:  
Nephrotoxicity was analysed across the 2 adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies. Across these studies, 
10 subjects (4.4%) experienced events of potential nephrotoxicity including renal failure (N=4), renal 
failure acute (N=3), anuria (N=2), and oliguria (N=1). SAEs were reported in 3 subjects: renal failure 
acute, renal failure and blood creatinine increased (1 for each)). None of the events of potential 
nephrotoxicity led to study drug discontinuation or interruption, and none of the events had a fatal

outcome. The incidence of nephrotoxicity across the pooled dataset was similar compared to adult ALL 
population. 
Neoplasms:  
Neoplasms were analysed across the 2 adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies. In adult R/R population, 
14 of 225 subjects reported at least 1 TEAEs of neoplasm including 8 cases of acute leukaemia (4 ALL, 
2 acute leukaemias, 1 AML and 1 B precursor type acute leukaemia) and 1 case of each following 
neoplasms: chloroma, gingival cancer, leukaemia cutis, leukaemic infiltration extramedullary, 
lymphoma, neoplasm, papilloma and squamous cell carcinoma.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In Study MT103-211, a total of 121 subjects (64%) had 305 treatment-emergent SAEs during 
treatment. Overall, “Infection and Infestations” was the most common SOC of SAE reported in 60 
subjects (31.7/%), followed by Nervous System disorders and Blood and lymphatic disorders (29/189, 
15.3% for each). The most common treatment-emergent SAE (occurred in more than 5 subjects) were 
febrile neutropenia (N=16, 8.5%), pyrexia (N=11, 5.8%), pneumonia (N=9, 4.8%), sepsis (N=9, 
4.8%), device related infection (N=7, 3.7%), neutropenia (N=7, 3.7%), confusional state, 
encephalopathy, tremor and overdose (N=5, 2.6% for each). Among 121 subjects with treatment-
emergent SAEs, 28 subjects had fatal outcome (23%), 78 subjects had SAE resolved (64.5%), SAEs 
remained unresolved for 12 subjects (10.0%) and the outcome was unknown for 3 of them (2.5%). 
Three SAEs were reported as disease progression according to investigator.  
Per investigators, a total of 69 (36.5%) subjects with 124 treatment-emergent SAEs were considered 
to be related to blinatumomab. The highest SOC of related treatment-emergent SAE were nervous 
system disorders (12.2%, 23 subjects experiencing 30 SAEs), Infection and Infestations (8.5%, 16 
subjects with 21 SAEs), Blood and lymphatic disorders (6.9%, 13 subjects, with 14 SAE), Psychiatric 
disorders, Injury poisoning and procedural complication, and General disorders and administration site 
condition (N=7, 3.7% for each). Common PT of SAE related to blinatumomab (subject incidence of > 
2%) included febrile neutropenia (N=6, 3.2%), encephalopathy, overdose, tremor (N=5, 2.6% for 
each), confusional state, neutropenia, pneumonia, and pyrexia (N=4, 2.1% for each). Among 69 
subjects with related treatment-emergent SAEs, 3 subjects had fatal outcome (4.3%), 56 patients had 
SAE resolved (81.2%), unresolved for 9 subjects (13.0%) and the outcome was unknown for 1 of 
them (1.4%). It is of concern that 31 subjects (16.4%) experienced at least 1 neurological or 
psychiatric SAE which were considered related to blinatumomab. 7 subjects experienced SAE due to 
overdose or toxicity to various agents. 
SAE after the cut-off date (from 11 October 2013 through 30 March 2014): 57 SAEs were reported in 
34 subjects. The distribution of SAE by SOC and by PT appeared comparable to that reported before 
the cut-off date.  3 SAE were reported as disease progression according to investigator. 
SAE and fatal events were more frequently reported in older subjects than in subjects <65 years 
(72.0% vs 62.8% SAE, 20.0% vs 14.0% fatal AEs in groups ≥65 vs <65 years respectively). 
Deaths 
Overall, in the MT103-211 study, 116 of 189 (61.4%) subjects died, most frequently due to infections: 
46 subjects on-treatment or ≤ 30 days from last blinatumomab infusion, and 70 subjects > 30 days 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015

from last infusion. Of 46 subjects died ≤ 30 days from last infusion, 28 had fatal TEAEs according to 
the Applicant, 15 died due to disease progression, 2 did not respond to treatment, and 1 subject with 
haematological relapse died following retreatment. Of the 70 subjects who died > 30 days from last 
dose, only 2 subjects died due to fatal AEs according to the Applicant and 68 subjects died due to 
either disease progression (N=50) or other causes which were not reported as AE. (N=18: 11 died of 
infection, 2 died due to graft vs host disease, and 1 subject each died of pulmonary inflammation post-
HSCT, relapse of respiratory insufficiency, subarachnoid bleed, post-transplant and unknown cause). 
The highest SOC of TEAE leading to death was infections/infestations (17/189, 9%) and Sepsis was the 
most common fatal TEAT (N=4, 2.1%). No AEs leading to death were reported for subjects who were 
in remission.

The cause of death in more than half of the cases was due to disease progression (56%, 65 of 116 
subjects who died). However, per protocol, disease progression, according to investigator, was not 
considered an AE (except of more serious than expected), and therefore the majority of AEs of disease 
progression were not required by the Applicant to be reported as TEAE or SAE. Additionally, fatal AEs

that occurred > 30 days after the last infusion (except of 3 events assigned a PT by investigator) were 
not included in the summary of fatal TEAEs.   
Immunological events 
In the pivotal clinical study (N=189), less than 1.4% of patients treated with blinatumomab tested 
positive for binding and neutralising anti-blinatumomab antibodies. All patients who tested positive for 
binding antibodies also tested positive for neutralising anti-blinatumomab antibodies.  
Laboratory findings 
Elevated liver enzymes 
Of 189 subjects enrolled in the pivotal study, 52 subjects (27.5%) reported 107 TEAEs of elevated liver 
enzymes events. ALT (12.7%, 24/189) and AST increased (11.1%, 21/189) were 2 most commonly 
reported events, followed by blood bilirubin increased (7.9%, 15/189) and Gamma-
glutamyltransferase increased (4.8%, 9/189). Twenty nine subject (15.3%) experienced ≥ grade 3 
hepatic TEAEs, mainly due to ALT increased, events were resolved for a half of them (14/29; 48.3%). 
Serious liver enzyme events were reported in 4 subjects (2.1%). No subject died as a direct result of 
liver injury or unequivocally met the full characteristics of a Hy’s Law case, 9 subjects died due to 
causes other than elevated liver enzyme events according to the Applicant. 
The duration of hepatic adverse reactions was generally brief and with rapid resolution, often when 
continuing uninterrupted treatment. 
Electrolyte abnormalities 
In the pivotal study, 7 subjects had potassium decreases that met the criteria for an AE, while there 
were no subjects having potassium increases that met the criteria for an AE. 8 subjects had AEs of 
hypocalcemia. None of these electrolyte abnormalities was considered related to blinatumomab, the 
majority of event (except 1 for each) were resolved.  
Immunoglobulins:  
In the pivotal study, 23 TEAEs of decreased immunoglobulin events were reported for 21 of 189 
(11.1%) subjects, 18 of them were treatment related, and the majority of events was unresolved 
(18/21; 85.7%). No serious or fatal events were reported. The most common TEAE by PT was 
immunoglobulins decreased (N=17), followed by IgG decreased (N=3), IgA decreased, IgM decreased 
and hypogammaglobulinaemia (N=1 for each).

Out of 25 subjects who were ≥ 65 years, 11 achieved CR/CRh and, of these, 8 subjects (8/11; 72.7%) 
entered the consolidation phase of the study and 3 subjects (3/8; 37.5%) completed 5 cycles of 
blinatumomab treatment.  No significant trends were noted for serious adverse events in subjects ≥65 
years (neutropenia and urinary tract infection increased and device related infection and urosepsis 
decreased).

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In Study MT103-211, the most common concomitant medications were antibacterial agents (97.9%), 
analgesics (97.4%) and corticosteroids (95.8%). Since blinatumomab is intended to be administered 
under monotherapy, antineoplastic agents were prohibited during core study, information for

evaluation of direct interaction between blinatumomab and concomitantly used medications, prescribed 
according to individual needs, is limited. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Thirty four (34) subjects (18%) experienced 55 TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
in Study MT103-211. Thirty four (34) AEs in 18 subjects were considered related to blinatumomab by 
investigators including all neurological (7 subjects) and psychiatric AEs (5 subjects). Six (6) of 10 
infections leading to drug discontinuation were considered treatment-related. 
TEAE that led to treatment interruption occurred most frequently in cycle 1. Within cycle 1, the highest 
number of events (22 of 46) occurred during the first week of treatment, followed by 18 in week 2. 
Similarly, most TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation occurred in cycle 1 (28 of 36); however, 
TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation were more uniformly distributed across treatment weeks 
and the treatment-free interval than treatment-emergent adverse events that led to treatment 
interruption.   
Nervous system disorders such as confusional state, tremor, encephalopathy, neurotoxicity, aphasia, 
ataxia and convulsion, were the first cause leading to drug interruption (12.7%). The majority of AEs 
was resolved after infusion interruption. Dose delays due to AEs may cause efficacy concerns due to 
the possibility of allowing the cancer to progress during the treatment interruption. In Study MT103-
211, CR/CRh* rates in subjects who interrupted blinatumomab treatment due to an AE (39.6%) or due 
to neurologic AE (42.1%) were similar to remission rates overall (42.9%).

2.8.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Applicant analysed the safety of blinatumomab for adult Philadelphia-negative relapsed/refractory 
ALL population based upon pooled safety data from 2 phase II studies in 225 subjects. The approach is 
not considered acceptable because the population in the supportive study MT103-206 was different 
from that of MT103-211. In particular, a population of subjects with more severe disease was recruited 
in study MT103-211 as compared to patients recruited in supportive study MT103-206 which has an 
important impact not only on efficacy results but also on the incidence and severity of safety profile. 
Furthermore, the dosing regimens were very different between the two adult R/R ALL studies and 
there is no direct evidence of the PK bioequivalence between 2 dosing regimens. Therefore, the safety 
of blinatumomab in the applied indication is primarily supported by data from the pivotal Phase II 
study MT103-211 where 189 adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL received blinatumomab as 
monotherapy at intended dose regimen. Given the rarity of the disease and the lack of fully approved 
therapies for the treatment of adult with Ph-negative R/R B-precursor ALL, the size of Study MT103-
211 (N=189) provide an acceptable safety database for conditional authorization application. 
The intended dose regimen was 5 cycles of blinatumomab infusion at a dose of 9 or 28 µg/day over a 
period of ≥ 6 months. However, only 10 subjects in pivotal study received all 5 cycles of blinatumomab 
infusion. In order to assess the risks associated with the long-term exposure of subjects to 
blinatumomab, an analysis of the incidence of AE trends over time for pivotal Study MT103-211 was 
conducted. No evidence of increased risk could be identified by extending the treatment period through 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 95/124 
 
 
 
 
 
additional consolidation cycles. However, the long-term safety analysis was conducted in only 12 
subjects including 3 elderly subjects and safety data with 5-cycle exposure are still considered very 
preliminary. As such, the proposed 3-cycle consolidation by blinatumomab might put some special 
population at risk of unfavourable benefit/risk balance. Therefore, patients may receive up to 2 initial 
cycles of treatment. A single cycle of treatment is 4 weeks of continuous infusion. Each cycle of 
treatment is separated by a 2 week treatment-free interval. Patients who have achieved complete 
remission (CR/CRh) after 2 treatment cycles may receive up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab 
consolidation treatment, based on an individual benefit-risk assessment (see SmPC section 4.2). Long-
term safety data will be available from the ongoing phase 3 study MT103211 (see Annex II and RMP) 
to establish the long-term safety profile of blinatumomab. 
There was only 1 subject with body weight under 45 kg in the pivotal study therefore a full comparison 
of blinatumomab safety profile at recommend dose (9µg/day and 28 µg/day) could not be applied 
between subjects weighing ≥45kg and <45kg. Further data on blinatumomab safety profile in subjects 
weighing < 45 kg are expected to be collected in the planned observational study (see RMP). For 
patients at least 45 kg in weight, the recommended starting dose for cycle 1 is 9 mcg/day followed by 
a dose of 28 mcg/day. For subsequent cycles the recommended dose is 28 mcg/day. The solution for 
infusion is to be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion delivered at a constant flow rate 
using an infusion pump over a period of up to 96 hours. Infusion lines should not be flushed into the 
patient, as it will cause an inadvertent bolus of blinatumomab to be administered. Blinatumomab 
should be infused through a dedicated lumen.  
Almost all subjects (188/189) in pivotal study MT103-211 experienced at least 1 AE. SAEs and death 
were reported in 64% and 14.8% of subjects respectively. Of note, per protocol, progressive disease 
was not considered as an AE, unless it was more severe than expected for the patient, therefore, many 
deaths due to progressive disease were not counted as SAE. Laboratory abnormalities were only 
reported as AEs when they were considered clinically relevant by investigator. The most affected SOC 
were General Disorder and Administration Site Conditions, Gastrointestinal Disorders, Nervous System 
Disorders, Infections and Infestations  and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders. The most common 
adverse reactions were: infusion-related reaction (67.2%), pyrexia (59.8%), headache (34.4%), 
febrile neutropenia (28%), peripheral oedema (25.9%), nausea (24.3%), hypokalaemia (23.8%), 
constipation (20.6%), anaemia (20.1%), diarrhoea (18.0%), tremor (17.5%), fatigue (15.3%) and 
chills (15.3%) (see SmPC section 4.8). The most serious adverse reactions reported during 
blinatumomab treatment include: neurologic events (16.4%), infections (31.7%), cytokine release 
syndrome (0.5%), tumour lysis syndrome (0.5%), and neutropenia/febrile neutropenia (15.3%). 
Overall, the nature of reported TEAE in pivotal study appears consistent with what could be expected in 
the intended population with an immunosuppressive therapy, with the exception of unusual incidence 
of nervous system disorders and medication errors (e.g. overdose, see below).  
Neurological events including events with a fatal outcome have been observed in patients receiving 
blinatumomab. A logistic regression analysis showed that only subjects with platelets < 50,000/µL at 
baseline or a medical history of neurologic signs and symptoms (such as dizziness, hypoaesthesia, 
hyporeflexia, tremor, dysaesthesia, paraesthesia, memory impairment) demonstrated a higher rate of 
neurologic events (i.e. tremor, dizziness, confusional state, encephalopathy and ataxia).  
Although patients with a history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system (CNS) 
pathology (i.e. epilepsy, seizure, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson’s 
disease, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis) were excluded from clinical trials some 
patients with a history of CNS pathology were included in the studies without being considered as 
Assessment report

protocol deviations. There is however limited experience in patients with a history or presence of 
clinically relevant CNS pathology and a possibility of a higher risk of neurologic events in this 
population. Therefore, the potential benefits of treatment should be carefully weighed against the risk 
of neurologic events and heightened caution should be exercised when administering blinatumomab to 
these patients (see SmPC section 4.4). 
There is limited experience with blinatumomab in patients with documented active ALL in the CNS or 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However patients have been treated with blinatumomab in clinical studies 
after clearance of CSF blasts with CNS directed therapy (such as intrathecal chemotherapy). Therefore 
once the CSF is cleared, treatment with blinatumomab may be initiated (see SmPC section 4.4). 
It is also recommended that a neurological examination be performed in patients prior to starting 
blinatumomab therapy and that patients be clinically monitored for signs and symptoms of neurologic 
events (e.g. writing test). Management of these signs and symptoms to resolution may require either 
temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab (see section 4.2). In the event 
of a seizure, secondary prophylaxis with appropriate anticonvulsant medicinal products (e.g. 
levetiracetam) is recommended (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Since confusion and disorientation, coordination and balance disorders, risk of seizures and 
disturbances in consciousness can occur with blinatumomab, it has major influence on the ability to 
drive and use machines. Patients receiving blinatumomab should refrain from driving, engaging in 
hazardous occupations or activities such as driving or operating heavy or potentially dangerous 
machinery while blinatumomab is being administered. Patients must be advised that they may 
experience neurologic events (see SmPC section 4.7). 
Overall, neurologic events are considered an important identified risk in the RMP which will be 
monitored by routine as well as by additional pharmacovigilance activities (see RMP): study MT103211 
(extension cohort), study 20150136, study 20150163 and study 20150228.  
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes showing leukoencephalopathy have been observed 
in patients receiving blinatumomab, especially in patients with prior treatment with cranial irradiation 
and anti-leukaemic chemotherapy (including systemic high dose methotrexate or intrathecal 
cytarabine). The clinical significance of these imaging changes is unknown (see SmPC section 4.4). The 
Applicant stated that no patient has met the diagnosis for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML). However, the possible risk of PML, a well-known risk of B-cell depletion therapies with anti-
CD20 antibodies, is of concern, considering that the safety dataset of blinatumomab is limited and the 
long-term safety of blinatumomab is still unknown. In addition, two cases of fatal encephalopathy were 
reported in the pivotal study. Only for one patient, it was considered related to blinatumomab by 
investigator. However, according to narratives, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or lumbar 
puncture was performed; the cause of this fatal encephalopathy was not established. Due to the 
preliminary safety data, the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in patient 
treatment by blinatumomab cannot be excluded. Leukoencephalopathy (including PML) has been 
included in the RMP as a potential risk. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms. In case 
of suspicious events consider consultation with a neurologist, brain MRI and examination of cerebral 
spinal fluid (CSF) (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Data on anti-leukemic prophylaxis (only intrathecal chemotherapy but not cranial irradiation) were also 
provided. Although no effect was observed on the occurrence of neurologic events, intrathecal 
chemotherapy prophylaxis is recommended before and during Blinatumomab therapy to prevent 
central nervous system ALL relapse (see SmPC section 4.2).

One hundred and nineteen (63%) out of 189 subjects in the pivotal study reported 252 infectious 
events, the most frequent being pneumonia. Half of them (60/119) were serious infections including 
sepsis, pneumonia, bacteraemia, opportunistic infections and catheter site infections, some of which 
were life-threatening or fatal (see SmPC section 4.4).  The results of a univariate analysis of time to 
first onset of infections revealed a significantly higher rate of infections in subjects with ECOG PS at 
baseline of 2as compared respectively to subjects with ECOG PS of 0, suggesting that ECOG PS and 
general condition at baseline played an important role in the frequency of infections following the 
treatment. Overall, the types and severities of infections were consistent with what could be expected 
in this population. Based on its mechanism of action, it is expected that blinatumomab contributes to 
the emergence of infections. However, other confounding factors could also contribute to 
immunosuppression in these subjects. Due to the lack of control group and blinded randomisation, it is 
not possible to evaluate to what degree blinatumomab contributes to the development of infections in 
such population. Patients receiving blinatumomab should be clinically monitored for signs and 
symptoms of infection and treat appropriately. Management of infections may require either temporary 
interruption or discontinuation of blinatumomab (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Decreased serum 
immunoglobulin levels are important risk factor for infections and have also been included in the RMP 
as important identified risk. The risk of infection will be closely monitored through routine and 
additional pharmacovigilance activities (see RMP).   
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which may be life-threatening or fatal (grade ≥4) has been reported 
in patients receiving blinatumomab. Serious adverse events that may be signs and symptoms of CRS 
included pyrexia, asthenia, headache, hypotension, total bilirubin increased, and nausea; uncommonly, 
these events led to blinatumomab discontinuation. The median time to onset of a CRS event was 2 
days.  Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of these events. Overall, the CRS 
events seemed to be manageable by dose-stepping regimen together with premedication with 20 mg 
IV dexamethasone 1 hour prior to initiation of each cycle of blinatumomab infusion. It should be noted 
that many R/R ALL patients with CRS had overlapping symptomatology due to e.g. fever, neutropenia, 
infection, tumor lysis syndrome, infusion reaction. The lack of the control arm did not allow to 
objectively evaluate the risk magnitude of CRS induced by blinatumomab. Cytokine release syndrome 
has been included in the RMP as important identified risk.  
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and capillary leak syndrome (CLS, e.g. hypotension, 
hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and haemoconcentration) have been commonly associated with CRS. 
Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) has also been 
uncommonly reported in the setting of CRS (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
With regards to capillary leak syndrome, this event was reported in 7 subjects (1.5%) in the pooled 
safety dataset, 2 cases were classified as life-threatening adverse event, no fatal case was reported. 
Capillary leak syndrome is an important identified risk with blinatumomab treatment which will be 
monitored and evaluated in ongoing and future clinical studies of blinatumomab (see RMP). 
Furthermore, patients experiencing capillary leak syndrome should be managed promptly (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  
Although ALL is a hypercoagulable state which could increase the risk of thromboembolic events 
(including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) events, without a control group it is impossible 
to know to what degree blinatumomab contributed to the development of these events. In addition, 
based on nonclinical findings, binding of blinatumomab to T cells can induce up-regulation of adhesion 
molecules on endothelial cells, reduced T cell rolling velocity and consequently increases T cell 
adhesiveness to endothelial cell. Therefore, thromboembolic events (including disseminated 
intravascular coagulation) will be closely monitored as considered important potential risk in the RMP.

Infusion reactions may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations of CRS (see sections 4.4 and 
4.8). Patients should be observed closely for infusion reactions, especially during the initiation of the 
first and second treatment cycles and treated appropriately. Anti-pyretic use (e.g. paracetamol) is 
recommended to help reduce pyrexia during the first 48 hours of each cycle. Management of these 
events may require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of blinatumomab (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). Based on the experience and data from study MT103-206 in R/R ALL as well as from other 
earlier blinatumomab studies in MRD ALL or NHL showed that infusion related reactions were especially 
associated with a higher dosage of the blinatumomab infusion, particularly, at the initial dose level, 
and high tumor burden. A vigorous instruction regarding dose reduction and re-initiation, prophylactic 
use of dexamethasone was provided in the pivotal study protocol to further mitigate the potential risks 
associated with blinatumomab administration. These measures have been effective at reducing the 
signs and symptoms of infusion reaction and cytokine release syndrome. Therefore and in line with the 
pivotal study, dexamethasone 20 mg intravenous should be administered 1 hour prior to initiation of 
each cycle of blinatumomab therapy. Pre-phase treatment for patients with high tumour burden 
includes prophylactic use of high dose dexamethasone for patients with the proportion of blasts >50% 
or peripheral blood blast count   15,000/L during screening phase (not to exceed 24 mg/day) (see 
SmPC section 4.2).  
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been observed in patients receiving blinatumomab and is considered 
an important identified risk with blinatumomab in R/R ALL patients (see RMP). It may be life-
threatening or fatal due to metabolic complications, potentially leading to lethal cardiac arrhythmias 
and renal failure. Appropriate prophylactic measures including aggressive hydration and anti-
hyperuricaemic therapy (such as allopurinol or rasburicase) should be used for the prevention and 
treatment of TLS during blinatumomab treatment, especially in patients with higher leukocytosis or a 
high tumour burden. Patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, including 
renal function and fluid balance in the first 48 hours after the first infusion. In clinical studies, patients 
with moderate renal impairment showed an increased incidence of TLS compared with patients with 
mild renal impairment or normal renal function. Management of these events may require either 
temporary interruption or discontinuation of blinatumomab (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). The safety of 
blinatumomab has also not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see SmPC section 
4.8). The use of blinatumomab in patients with renal impairment will be closely monitored (see RMP). 
There is a high risk for medication errors to occur at any time during the reconstitution, dilution and 
administration of blinatumomab. This is an important concern related to drug safety (e.g. overdose) 
and efficacy (problem of compliance with infusion). It is very important that the instructions for 
preparation (including reconstitution and dilution) and administration are strictly followed to minimise 
medication errors (including underdose and overdose) (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Medication errors 
will also be closely monitored through routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities (see RMP). In 
addition, routine and additional risk minimization measures will be put in place, in particular 
educational material will be distributed to healthcare providers (pharmacists, physicians, and nurses) 
(see further below and RMP). This documentation will clarify the modalities of both preparation and 
administration as well as the description of the posology regimen with clear diagrams. 
Overdoses have been observed including one patient who received 133-fold the recommended 
therapeutic dose of blinatumomab delivered over a short duration. Overdoses resulted in adverse 
reactions which were consistent with the reactions observed at the recommended therapeutic dose and 
included fever, tremors, and headache. In the event of overdose, the infusion should be temporarily 
interrupted and patients should be monitored. Reinitiation of blinatumomab at the correct therapeutic 
dose should be considered when all toxicities have resolved and no earlier than 12 hours after 
interruption of the infusion (see section 4.9). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 99/124 
 
 
 
 
 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, including life threatening cases, have been observed in patients 
receiving blinatumomab. Laboratory parameters (including, but not limited to white blood cell count 
and absolute neutrophil count) should be monitored routinely during blinatumomab infusion, especially 
during the first 9 days of the first cycle, and treated appropriately (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Overall concerning cytopenia, grade 3 and 4 decreases in neutrophils, red blood cells and platelets 
were frequently reported in pivotal study. However, direct myelosuppression is not expected as part of 
the known mechanism of action and considering available non clinical data. ALL disease progression 
generally leads to decreases in blood counts. Furthermore, recovery of peripheral blood cells to 
baseline levels (or above) occurred by the end of the first cycle of treatment despite ongoing exposure 
to blinatumomab by continuous infusion in clinical studies. Moreover there was consistent 
improvement of peripheral counts during subsequent cycles of therapy. This long-term recovery would 
not be feasible if blinatumomab was directly myelosuppressive or myelotoxic.  
Treatment with blinatumomab was also associated with transient elevations in liver enzymes. The 
majority of the events were observed within the first week of blinatumomab initiation and did not 
require interruption or discontinuation of blinatumomab (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). A review of 
27 subjects who met the criteria of AST/ALT ≥ 3 x ULN and total blood bilirubin ≥ 2 x ULN revealed 
that the rapid onset of elevations in liver enzymes coincided with the onset of clinical signs and 
symptoms of CRS with or without infection and concomitant hepatotoxic medications (data not shown). 
This finding suggested that these plausible alternative aetiologies were also present. Monitoring of 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during blinatumomab treatment especially 
during the first 48 hours of the first 2 cycles should be performed. Management of these events may 
require either temporary interruption or discontinuation of blinatumomab (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Worsening of hepatic impairment in patients with hepatic is a potential risk that will be closely 
monitored (see RMP). The safety of blinatumomab has also not been studied in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Malignant neoplasms may be attributed to underlying disease and/or treatment-related 
immunosuppression. However, given the small size of adult ALL population and relatively short 
exposure to blinatumomab (long-term safety profile unknown), it is unknown if blinatumomab 
contribute to the progression of other malignancies. Data will continue to be collected as part of the 
monitoring of long term safety in accordance with the risk management plan. 
With regards to immunogenicity, the incidence of neutralizing ADAs was overall low. Anti-
blinatumomab antibody formation might affect pharmacokinetics of blinatumomab. Due to sparse 
clinical data and the lack of long-term data, immunogenicity is considered as an important potential 
risk in the RMP until additional clinical and long-term data are available. If formation of anti-
blinatumomab antibodies with a clinically significant effect is suspected, antibody testing can be 
discussed with the MAH (see SmPC section 4.8 and package leaflet). 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Overall and based on the available information on the safety profile of blinatumomab, consideration to 
discontinue blinatumomab temporarily or permanently as appropriate should be made in the case of 
severe (grade 3) or life-threatening (grade 4) cytokine release syndrome, tumour lysis syndrome, 
neurological toxicity, elevated liver enzymes and any other clinically relevant toxicities. If the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015

interruption of treatment after an adverse event is no longer than 7 days, the same cycle can be 
continued to a total of 28 days of infusion inclusive of days before and after the interruption in that 
cycle.  If an interruption due to an adverse event is longer than 7 days, a new cycle is to be started. If 
the toxicity takes more than 14 days to resolve, blinatumomab should be discontinued permanently, 
except if described differently in the table included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In addition, treatment with blinatumomab should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by 
physicians experienced in the treatment of haematological malignancies. In addition, hospitalisation is 
recommended for initiation at a minimum for the first 9 days of the first cycle and the first 2 days of 
the second cycle. In patients with a history or presence of clinically relevant central nervous system 
(CNS) pathology (see SmPC section 4.4), hospitalisation is recommended at a minimum for the first 14 
days of the first cycle. In the second cycle, hospitalisation is recommended at a minimum for 2 days, 
and clinical judgment should be based on tolerance to BLINCYTO in the first cycle. Caution should be 
exercised as cases of late occurrence of first neurological events in the second cycle have been 
observed. For all subsequent cycle starts and reinitiation (e.g., if treatment is interrupted for 4 or more 
hours), supervision by a healthcare professional or hospitalisation is recommended (see SmPC section 
4.2). 
Regarding special populations, there is limited experience with blinatumomab in patients ≥ 75 years of 
age (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8). Safety was generally similar between elderly patients (≥ 65 
years of age) and patients less than 65 years of age treated with blinatumomab. However, elderly 
patients (≥65 years) had a higher subject incidence of SAE compared to subjects <65 years (72.0% vs 
62.8% respectively) (see also discussion on neurologic events). Elderly patients also experienced a 
higher rate of neurological toxicities, including cognitive disorder, encephalopathy, and confusion (see 
SmPC section 4.8). 
Safety and efficacy of blinatumomab has not yet been established in paediatric patients since there is 
limited experience in paediatric patients. No recommendation on a posology can be made. The 
recommended adult dose should not be used in paediatric patients. Blinatumomab has been evaluated 
in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor ALL in a phase I/II dose 
escalation/evaluation study. At a dose higher than the recommended dose for adult patients, a case of 
fatal cardiac failure occurred in the setting of life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 
tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). Further efficacy and safety data in the 
paediatric population are expected from two ongoing paediatric studies (study MT103-205 and study 
20120215) (see RMP). 
Off-label use in non-approved haematological malignancies in both adults and children is an important 
potential risk that will be monitored by routine pharmacovigilance (see RMP). 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of blinatumomab in pregnant women. Depletions 
of B- and T-cells were observed in the pregnant mice but haematological effects were not assessed in 
foetuses (see non-clinical section). However haematological disorders in newborns following in utero 
exposure cannot be excluded (notably B cell depletion with a risk of infections in case of a vaccination 
with live virus vaccines) and have been included as an important potential risk in the RMP and will be 
closely monitored. Therefore, blinatumomab should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential 
benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. In addition, in case of exposure during pregnancy 
newborns should be monitored for B cell depletion and vaccinations with live virus vaccines should be 
postponed until the infant’s B cell count has recovered (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). Furthermore, 
women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for at least 2 days, 
after treatment with blinatumomab (see section 4.6). Blinatumomab did not affect cytochrome P450 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 101/124 
 
 
 
 
 
enzymes activities in vitro, which suggests that no drug interaction may be expected with oral 
contraceptive. 
However given that Blinatumomab is not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes and that no effect on 
embryo-fetal development was observed in mice with the surrogate, no contraceptive measure for 
treated males with women of childbearing potential partners is deemed necessary. 
With regards to the use of blinatumomab in lactation, no data related to milk excretion of 
blinatumomab are available and it is unknown whether blinatumomab or metabolites are excreted in 
human milk (see SmPC section 4.6). Based on its pharmacological properties, a risk to the suckling 
child cannot be excluded. Consequently, as a precautionary measure, breast-feeding is contra-
indicated during and for at least 48 hours after treatment with blinatumomab (see SmPC sections 4.3 
and 4.6).  
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of blinatumomab on fertility. Effect on fertility 
is included in the RMP under missing information. 
In general, since the safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines during or following blinatumomab 
therapy has not been studied, vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 2 
weeks prior to the start of blinatumomab treatment, during treatment, and until recovery of B 
lymphocytes to normal ranges following last treatment cycle (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Considering the present knowledge of use in patients with race or ethnic origin other than white is very 
limited, the use in patients with ethnic differences is included in the RMP under missing information 
and will be closely monitored.  
The following issues have also been included as missing information in the RMP due to exclusion 
criteria in clinical trials or due to lack of data and will be closely monitored: Use in patients with active 
uncontrolled infections, Use in patients with HIV positivity or chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or 
hepatitis C virus, Use in patients after recent HSCT, Recent or concomitant treatment with other 
anticancer therapies (incl. radiotherapy), Recent or concomitant treatment with other immunotherapy. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The assessment was primarily based on data issued from a single-arm, open-label pivotal study, which 
hampered the evaluation of the safety profile of the product in particular the frequency or distribution 
of safety events in targeted population. Additional safety data from the ongoing comparative phase III 
study assessing blinatumomab versus standard chemotherapy in adult patients with 
Relapsed/Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (study 00103311), in particular long-
term data, will be provided to further establish the safety profile of blinatumomab. Furthermore, safety 
data will also be provided from the planned observational study of blinatumomab safety and 
effectiveness, utilisation, and treatment practices (study 20150136). 
2.8.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, with the exception of unusually high rate of neurologic/psychiatric events as well as serious 
procedural complications (e.g. overdose, device related infection), the nature of reported AEs consists 
with what could be expected in adults with high-risk, heavily-pre-treated, R/R ALL treated by an 
immunosuppressive therapy. From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical 
trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. The SmPC also includes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015

instructions for dose management and monitoring adverse drug reactions, posology and method of 
administration, including instructions for premedication and dosing adjustments for grade 3 or higher 
events, which are considered adequate to manage the risks.  
In support of the SmPC, targeted educational brochures to increase the awareness and mitigate the 
risks in particular medication errors as well as neurological events will be distributed to healthcare 
providers (pharmacists, physicians, and nurses).  
The CHMP also considers the following measure necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
  Study of BiTE Antibody Blinatumomab Versus Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Adult 
Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory B-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (see 
Annex II, specific obligation):  
o  Submit the final CSR of Study 00103311 (TOWER) by 31 March 2017 
In addition the CHMP considers the following measure necessary to further characterize the safety 
profile of blinatumomab in routine clinical practice (see Annex II condition): 
  Study 20150136: An observational study of blinatumomab safety and effectiveness, utilisation, 
and treatment practices 
o  Submit the protocol within 2 months after the EU Commission decision 
o  Annual interim reports within PSURs 
o  Final results of the Non-interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) by 
December 2021 
2.9.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  1.2  (dated  13  August  2015)  could  be  acceptable  if  the 
applicant  implements  the  changes  to  the  RMP  as  described  in  the  PRAC  endorsed  PRAC  Rapporteur 
Updated assessment report.  
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC.  
The  CHMP  endorsed  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  2.0  (dated  22  September  2015)  with  the 
following content:

2.10.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3)(ia) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 114/124 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It has a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation;  
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation.  
 
 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The overall CR/CRh* rate obtained with blinatumomab in pivotal study MT103-211 after the first two 
cycles (81/189, 42.9%) is significant in relapsed/refractory adult ALL setting. Of note, CRs (67/82) 
prevailed over CRh* (15/82), and an overall 51.9% rate of CR/CRh* plus aplastic bone marrow 
response was reported in study MT103-211. Patients responding to blinatumomab showed high rates 
of MRD response.  
The median relapse-free survival was 5.9 months (95% CI: 4.8 to 8.3 months), which is considered 
meaningful in patients for whom HSCT is an option, since it can increase the probability of reaching 
transplant in CR.  The median OS for all subjects was 6.1 months (95% CI:  4.2, 7.5).  Data clearly 
showed that median OS is significantly longer in patients who reached a CR or CRh* compared to not-
responders, even more if a MRD response was obtained.  A possible OS benefit is expected, since in 
historical study 20120310 the median OS in 1112 patients with available data, weighted to the MT103-
211 study population, was 3.3 months, and 3.9 months in the provided MBMA.  
The overall rate of patients who received an HSCT in study MT103-211 was 39.5%, with a median time 
to transplant of 1 to 3 months. This transplant rate is considered clinically significant, and the 100-day 
post-HSCT mortality rate (11.3%) is also reassuring. 
Promising results, although derived from only 6 patients, were observed in adult ALL patients in late (> 
12 months) relapse enrolled in the Supportive study MT103-206 (CR/CRh* 6/6 [100%], 5 CR and 1 
CRh*). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The absence of a comparator arm impacts on the interpretation of the clinical benefit of blinatumomab 
in the sought indication. To further support the results obtained in study MT103-211, the Applicant will 
submit the final CSR for study 00103311 (TOWER), an ongoing phase 3, randomized, open-label study 
designed to investigate the efficacy of blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in adult 
subjects with relapsed/refractory b-precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). Therefore, the 
CHMP has imposed a condition to the marketing authorisation in Annex II for the submission of the 
ongoing study 00103311 (TOWER). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 115/124 
 
 
 
 
 
The indication includes both the population of poor outcome (included in the pivotal trial), and the 
population with a less severe condition (included in the supportive study MT103-206). Only few 
efficacy data has been provided by the Applicant in patients in late first relapse. The available 
information from studies MT103 206 and MT10+3211 suggested that CR/CRh would be in the order of 
8/9 (88.8%) late first relapse patients, and 5/9 (55.5%) MRD response. Although uncertainties are still 
present, the efficacy was considered established. From a clinical point of view the late first-relapse 
patient population is very heterogeneous, and it should be considered that a significant portion of 
patients may be intolerant to additional multi agent chemotherapy, either due to age, comorbidity or 
long-lasting treatment toxicity. At present, no effective treatment alternative can be identified for 
these patients.  Study 20150136 is expected to confirm the efficacy of blinatumomab in this late first 
relapse setting. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Almost all subjects (188/189) in pivotal study MT103-211 experienced at least 1 AE. The most serious 
adverse reactions reported during blinatumomab treatment include: infusion-related reactions 
(67.2%), infections (63.0%), pyrexia (59.8%), headache (34.4%), febrile neutropenia (28%), 
peripheral oedema (25.9%), nausea (24.3%), hypokalaemia (23.8%), constipation (20.6%), anaemia 
(20.1%), cough (18.5%), diarrhoea (18.0%), tremor (17.5%), neutropenia (17.5%), abdominal pain 
(16.9%), insomnia (15.3%), fatigue (15.3%) and chills (15.3%). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety data provided was based on a single-arm, open-label pivotal study, which hampered the 
evaluation of the safety profile of the product in particular the frequency or distribution of safety 
events in targeted population. Additional safety data from the ongoing comparative phase III study 
assessing blinatumomab versus standard chemotherapy in adult patients with Relapsed/Refractory B-
precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (study 00103311), in particular long-term data, will be 
provided to further establish the safety profile of blinatumomab. Furthermore, safety data will also be 
provided from the planned observational study of blinatumomab safety and effectiveness, utilisation, 
and treatment practices (study 20150136). 
More than 50% of patients in Study MT103-211 experienced at least one neurologic/psychiatric event 
most frequently tremor, dizziness, encephalopathy, paresthesia, aphasia, and confusional state, which 
were the first cause leading drug interruption (12.7%). Overall, neurologic events are considered an 
important identified risk in the RMP which will be monitored by routine as well as additional 
pharmacovigilance activities (see RMP): study MT103211, study 20150136study 20150163, and study 
20150228. 
Medication errors have been reported with BLINCYTO. In the pivotal study, the subject incidence of 
treatment-emergent overdose events was 3.2% (6/189); overdose and accidental overdose (preferred 
terms) were reported at an incidence of 2.6% (5/189) and 1.1% (2/189), respectively. Medication 
errors is an important concern related to drug safety (e.g. overdose) and efficacy (problem of 
compliance with infusion). These have been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2 and 
4.4). In addition, medication errors will also be closely monitored through routine and additional 
pharmacovigilance activities, in particular two surveys of healthcare providers and patients and

caregivers respectively (see RMP). Furthermore, routine and additional risk minimization measures will 
be put in place, in particular educational material will be distributed to healthcare providers 
(pharmacists, physicians, and nurses) (see RMP). This documentation will clarify the modalities of both 
preparation and administration as well as the description of the posology regimen with clear diagrams. 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The single pivotal study demonstrated that an induction regimen with 2 cycles of blinatumomab had a 
clear activity on relapsing/refractory Ph- B ALL in adult patients. One key point was that in complete 
responders, the residual disease is most of the time negative. This is of major interest given the high 
prognostic value of MRD in the therapeutic management of ALL: Indeed, a total of 65 Study MT103-
211 subjects of 189 (34.4%) achieved a confirmed molecular remission by PCR testing. Of those who 
achieved a CR/CRh* response and had evaluable MRD data, 82.2% (60/73) evaluable for MRD 
achieved molecular remission. 
Overall, the nature of reported TEAE in pivotal study appears consistent with what could be expected in 
the intended population with an immunosuppressive therapy, with the exception of unusual incidence 
of nervous system disorders and medication errors. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall CR/CRh* rate (42.9%) obtained with blinatumomab in pivotal study MT103-211 after the 
first two cycles is significant in relapsed/refractory adult ALL setting.  The safety profile of 
blinatumomab included pyrexia, headache, fatigue , nausea, tremor, hypokalaemia , diarrhoea and 
chills being the most common adverse events. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance for blinatumomab in 
the proposed indication is considered positive. 
However, the lack of a control arm in the pivotal study results in the need for confirmation of the 
benefit/risk profile of blinatumomab. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment  
Lack of controlled data warrants further clinical studies to provide comprehensive data on the benefit-
risk balance. The Applicant has proposed to conduct the below clinical study to meet this requirement.   
A Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) of blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in 
adult subjects with relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will provide 
comprehensive data to inform the benefit/risk (Study 00103311 /TOWER). 
The CHMP considered that BLINCYTO falls under the scope of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 507/2006 as eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation as it belongs to: 
a) Medicinal products designated as orphan medicinal products in accordance with Article 3 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000; 
b) Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously 
debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/469312/2015 
Page 117/124 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the requirements listed in Article 4 of Commission Regulation No 507/2006 apply to 
blinatumomab on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The risk-benefit balance of the product is positive:  
The overall CR/CRh* rate obtained with blinatumomab in pivotal study MT103-211 after the first two 
cycles (81/189, 42.9%) is significant in relapsed/refractory adult ALL setting despite the absence of 
confirmatory controlled data. The overall survival effect associated with BLINCYTO compared 
favourably against available treatment options although the precise magnitude of the benefit needs to 
be confirmed. 
Together with an acceptable safety-profile in patients in the proposed indication, the benefit-risk 
balance is considered positive. 
b) It is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data: 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy and safety of 
blinatumomab in the proposed indication. More specifically: 
- a Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) of blinatumomab versus standard of care chemotherapy in 
adult subjects with relapsed/refractory b-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will provide 
comprehensive data to inform the benefit/risk (Study 00103311 /TOWER). 
The phase 3 study will be successfully completed ahead of the original projections, despite the earlier 
approval of blinatumomab in the United States. Indeed, as of 30 April 2015, 319 of 400 planned 
subjects (80%) have been enrolled and 89 sites outside of the United States and Germany are 
currently open to enrolment. This study is expected to confirm the magnitude of the benefit in terms of 
safety and long-term efficacy endpoints compared to standard treatment options. Thus, it is likely that 
the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive clinical data. 
c) Fulfilment of unmet medical needs in the proposed indications: 
The OS of patients treated with blinatumomab in study MT103-211 was 6.1 months (median 
observation time 9.8 months), with a 6- and 12-month survival probability of 50% and 28% 
respectively. The 12- and 24-month OS rates reported for patients who achieved CR/CRh* after 
treatment with blinatumomab but who were not considered eligible to transplant were 47% and 
30.9%. These results are considered significant, since in the historical control 20120310 the reported 
12-month OS rate in a patient population similar to that enrolled in pivotal study MT103-211 was 15% 
(95% CI: 13-18%) despite transplant was an option, and, in a recent paper by Gökbuget et al. (Blood 
2012), no patient without SCT survived more than 1 year after relapse. Overall, the impact of 
blinatumomab on the OS of patients not eligible to HSCT is considered meaningful in this poor 
prognosis population. Therefore, an unmet medical need is recognized for these patients and will be 
fulfilled. 
d) The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required: 
In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile, the high response rate including MRD responses, and 
favourable overall survival duration compared to available treatment options, the immediate 
availability of BLINCYTO on the market outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are 
still required.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is by consensus of the opinion that BLINCYTO is not similar to Evoltra, Atriance, Sprycel, 
Xaluprine, and Iclusig within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 847/2000. 
See appendix 1.

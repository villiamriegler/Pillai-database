1. 
Introduction 
Sitagliptin phosphate, the active component of Xelevia, is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, 
developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  DPP-4 inhibitors act by enhancing the 
levels  of  active  incretin  hormones.  These  hormones,  including  glucagon-like  peptide-1  and  glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, are released from the intestine in response to a meal and are part 
of an endogenous system involved in glucose homeostasis.    
Xelevia  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  21  March  2007,  with  therapeutic  indications  for  use  in 
combination  with  metformin  or  a  PPAR-γ  agonist  when  treatment  with  metformin  or  the  PPAR-γ 
agonist alone provide inadequate glycemic control.  
In this Type II variation the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied to extend the indication 
to add a dual oral combination therapy with a sulphonylurea (SU) and to add a triple oral combination 
therapy with metformin (MET) and a sulphonylurea. 
In support of these indications results of one clinical trial has been submitted (Study P035).

Clinical aspects 
2.1 Efficacy 
2.1.1. Study P035 
2.1.2. Study design 
Study P035 was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin as add-on therapy 
in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin. 
The  study  had  a  24-week  double-blind  placebo-controlled  phase  (Phase  A)  followed  by  a  30-week 
active  comparator  (pioglitazone)  phase  (Phase  B).  Male  and  female  patients  with  T2DM,  who  were 
≥18  and  ≤75  years  of  age  at  the  screening  visit  and  who  were  either  (1)  not  on  AHA  (anti-
hyperglycaemic agent) or (2) on glimepiride (alone or in combination with metformin) or (3) on other 
AHAs  (alone  or  in  dual  or  triple  combination  therapy),  were  eligible  to  participate  if  they  met 
enrolment criteria. Patients who were already on a stable dose of glimepiride (at a dose of ≥4 mg/day) 
alone or in combination with metformin (at a dose of ≥1500 mg/day) who had an HbA1c ≥7.5% but 
≤10.5% and who met all other enrolment criteria directly entered a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in 
period,  and  after  completion  were  eligible  to  be  randomised.  Patients  not  on  AHA  or  those  on 
monotherapy or oral combination therapy who were not on a stable regimen of glimepiride alone or in 
combination with metformin entered an up to 6-week glimepiride (+/- metformin) dose titration period 
and  then  a  glimepiride  (+/-  metformin)  dose  stable  period  of  up  to  10  weeks.  Patients  who  had 
inadequate  glycaemic  control  after  the  dose-stable  period  (i.e.,  HbA1c  ≥7.5%  but  ≤10.5%)  and  who 
met all other enrolment criteria were eligible to be randomized after completing a 2 week single-blind 
placebo  run-in  period.  Patients  were  stratified  according  to  whether  or  not  they  were  on  metformin 
during the dose-stable period. Stratum 1 consisted of patients on glimepiride alone (i.e., monotherapy) 
and  Stratum  2  consisted  of  patients  on  glimepiride  and  metformin  in  combination  therapy.  The 
protocol indicated that 50% of the randomized patient sample should be in each stratum.  
Four  hundred  forty-one  (441)  patients  (the  entire  cohort)  were  randomized  at  73  sites  worldwide  to 
either  sitagliptin  100  mg  q.d.  (once  a  day)  or  placebo  in  a  1:1  ratio  for  a  24-week,  double-blind 
treatment  period  (Phase  A).  During  the  24-week  placebo-controlled  period,  patients  meeting 
glycaemic rescue criteria were to receive rescue medication (pioglitazone) and complete Phase A but 
were not eligible to continue into Phase B. 
Patients randomised to sitagliptin continued on sitagliptin during Phase B while those randomised to 
placebo  were  switched  to  pioglitazone  30  mg/day  at  entry  into  this  Phase.  Down-titration  of 
glimepiride during either Phase A or B was only allowed when required to manage hypoglycaemia.

The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c; fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
was a key secondary efficacy endpoint.  In addition, a subset of consenting patients (and hence not a 
randomly  selected  subpopulation)  underwent  a  9-point  meal  tolerance  test  (MTT),  which  measured 
pre-meal and post-meal glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. The MTT was performed after 24 weeks of 
treatment  (end  of  Phase  A)  and  was  also  to  be  performed  at  Week  54  (end  of  Phase  B).    Patients 
meeting  pre-specified  criteria  for  poor  glycaemic  control  were  to  receive  pioglitazone  as  rescue 
therapy; a prespecified time-to-rescue analysis was performed. 
Baseline characteristics (demographic, anthropometric characteristics, efficacy endpoints and duration 
of  diabetes)  were  generally  balanced  between  the  treatment  groups  in  the  entire  cohort,  and  also  in 
each  stratum.  One  exception  was  that  patients  in  Stratum  2  (patients  on  glimepiride  in  combination 
with  metformin)  had  slightly  lower  baseline  HbA1c  values,  a  longer  duration  of  type  2  diabetes 
mellitus, and were more likely to be on combination therapy at screening compared with patients in 
Stratum 1 (patients on glimepiride alone). 
2.1.3. Results 
HbA1c 
Results  for  HbA1c  are  shown  in  Table  1,  Table  2  and  Table  3.  Results  over  time  are  presented  in 
Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3. 
When added to glimepiride alone (Stratum 1), sitagliptin (SITA) resulted in a significant reduction in 
HbA1c after 24 weeks, while an increase was observed with placebo. The effect was maximal after 12 
weeks,  with  a  modest  rise  observed  from  week  12  to  week  24.  Difference  in  change  from  baseline 
between sitagliptin and placebo was –0.57 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.32) at week 24. 
The  same  pattern  was  seen  in  Stratum  2,  when  sitagliptin  or  placebo  was  added  to  combination 
treatment of glimepiride + metformin. Sitagliptin addition resulted a significant reduction in HbA1c, 
while placebo treatment resulted in an increase in HbA1c. Between group difference was –0.89 (-1.10, 
-0.68) in favour of sitagliptin. 
Pattern in the Entire Cohort was similar. 
The sitagliptin treatment group showed a larger within-group decrease from baseline in the completers 
analysis than in the APT (all patients treated) analysis; however, the placebo-adjusted treatment effects 
were smaller in the completers analysis (-0.68, -0.50, and -0.84%) than in the APT analysis (-0.74, -
0.57,  and  -0.89%)  in  the  entire  cohort  and  in  Strata  1  and  2,  respectively.  This  attenuation  of  the 
larger  number  of 
placebo-subtracted  decrease 
rescued/discontinued  patients  from  the  placebo  group  than  from  the  sitagliptin  groups  in  the 
completers  population,  relative  to  the  APT  population.  Rescued/discontinued  patients  generally  had 
poorer HbA1c responses compared with patients who completed without rescue therapy, and thus the 
placebo group in the completers analysis showed a greater reduction from baseline when the imputed 
Week 24 values for the rescued/discontinued subset were removed.

HbA1c goals 
Analysis  of  the  proportion  of  patients  with  HbA1c  values  below  7.0%  at  Week  24  showed  that 
sitagliptin  100  mg  significantly  increased  the  proportion  of  patients  reaching  the  goal  in  the  entire 
cohort (17.1% on sitagliptin 100 mg compared to 4.8% on placebo; p<0.001) and in the proportion of 
patients in Stratum 2  (22.6% on sitagliptin 100 mg compared to 1.0% on placebo; p<0.001), while the 
between-group  difference  in  the  proportion  of  patients  in  Stratum  1  (10.8%  on  sitagliptin  100  mg 
compared to 8.7% on placebo; p=0.638) was not statistically significant (Table 4). For the analyses of 
the  <  6.5%  goal,  the  between-group  difference  observed  in  the  entire  cohort  (5.5%  and  1.9%  in 
sitagliptin and placebo groups, respectively; p=0.069) and in Stratum 1 (2.9% and 3.9% in sitagliptin 
and  placebo  groups,  respectively;  p=0.693)  was  not  statistically  significant,  while  in  Stratum  2,  a 
significantly (p=0.004) greater proportion of patients in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group 
(7.8% vs. 0.0%) achieved this goal.

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
Sitagliptin was more effective than placebo in lowering FPG in the entire cohort and in each stratum 
(Difference –20.1 [95% CI: –28.4, -11.8], -19.3 [95% CI: -31.9, -6.7], and –20.7 [95% CI: -31.7, -9.7] 
for the entire cohort, stratum 1 and stratum 2 respectively). 
When FPG profiles over time were analysed for the entire cohort and the individual strata, a rise in 
FPG  with  sitagliptin  was  seen  after  a  nadir  was  reached  (Figure 4);  a  rise  in  the  placebo  group  was 
also  observed  that  was  modestly  less  prominent  than  the  rise  in  the  sitagliptin  group.  The  patterns 
within each stratum were similar to the pattern observed for the entire cohort.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Proinsulin to Insulin Ratio HOMA-β 
A  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  proinsulin  to  insulin  ratio  from  baseline  in  the  sitagliptin 
group was observed.  However, a smaller and non-statistically significant decrease was also observed 
in the placebo group such that the between-treatment group difference was not statistically significant. 
The results of HOMA-β change from baseline showed an increase for the sitagliptin group relative to 
the placebo group (p=0.021) at Week 24 (between-group difference of 12.0; 95% CI [1.8, 22.1]). 
β-Cell Function Assessments from Frequently Sampled MTT 
A  sub-study  was  conducted  (among  patients  who  consented)  using  a  frequently  sampled  meal 
tolerance test (collecting blood samples from 9 time-points) to assess changes in β-cell function with 
sitagliptin treatment.  The analysis of data from this sub-study has not been completed.  
Time-to-Rescue 
Patients  not  meeting  specific  glycaemic  goals  after  randomization  during  Phase  A  were  to  receive 
rescue  therapy  with  open-label  pioglitazone  and  a  prespecified  time  to  rescue  was  analysis  was 
performed..  In  the  entire  cohort  and  in  the  subset  of  patients  in  Stratum  2,  a  significant  difference 
(p<0.001) was observed in the proportion of patients rescued in the sitagliptin group (12.4% and 8.2% 
respectively  for  the  entire  cohort  and  subset  of  patients  in  Stratum  2)  relative  to  the  placebo  group 
(26.7% and 28.8%, respectively).  No significant difference was observed between the two treatment 
groups with respect to this parameter in the subset of patients in Stratum 1 (17.3% in the sitagliptin 
treatment group versus 24.4% in the placebo group (difference –7.1% [-18.6, 4.4]). 
The  time  to  rescue  was  later  in  the  sitagliptin  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  in  the  entire 
cohort and in the subset of patients in Stratum 2. No significant difference was observed between the 
two treatment groups in the subset of patients in Stratum 1(Figure 5, Figure 6).

Two-Hour Post-Meal Glucose (PMG) 
An MTT was performed in a subset of patients who consented to participate in a 9-point MTT. Results 
indicated that patients treated with sitagliptin had a lower PMG, a larger increase relative to placebo in 
2-hour  post-meal  insulin  (p=0.007),  2-hour  post-meal  C-peptide  (p<0.001),  C-peptide  total  AUC 
(p=0.005),  insulin  3-hour  total  AUC  to  glucose  3-hour  total  AUC  ratio  (p<0.001),  and  insulin  total 
AUC to glucose total AUC ratio (p=0.013).   
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
The  between-group  differences  for  subgroups  defined  by  baseline  efficacy  endpoint/disease-related 
characteristics demonstrated a notable difference between the two strata in HbA1c–lowering relative to 
placebo by baseline HbA1c category.  In Stratum 2 (patients on glimepiride plus metformin), stepwise 
and  markedly  greater  placebo-subtracted  HbA1c  lowering  was  observed  going  from  lower  to  higher 
baseline HbA1c categories: -0.55% in patients with baseline HbA1c of <8% to -1.34% in patients with 
baseline HbA1c ≥9%.  In contrast, in Stratum 1 (patients on glimepiride alone) no discernible trend in 
placebo-subtracted  HbA1c-lowering  was  observed  with  higher  baseline  HbA1c  categories.  For 
treatment effects on HbA1c by other baseline disease or glycaemic efficacy baseline characteristics, the 
responses  were  generally  consistent  across  subgroups  in  the  entire  cohort  and  in  the  two  strata, 
although  in  Stratum  2,  there  were  few  patients  who  were  treatment  naïve  or  who  were  on 
monotherapy. 
Study  P035  consisted  of  two  Strata:  in  Stratum  1  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  glimepiride 
monotherapy received either sitagliptin or placebo; in Stratum 2 sitagliptin or placebo was added to a 
combination of glimepiride and metformin in patients inadequately controlled by these two agents. 
The design of the study is acceptable for the CHMP, although it was discussed whether comparison 
with  an  active  component  (metformin)  would  have  been  desirable  for  stratum  1.  But  the  CHMP 
9/13

considered in this case that the placebo subtracted effects do give an appropriate estimate of the size of 
the effect. 
In both Strata sitagliptin resulted in a decrease in HbA1c at week 24, while an increase was seen in 
placebo  treated  patients.  In  Stratum  1  the  reduction  from  baseline  was  relatively  modest  (-0.3%  at 
week  24)  when  compared  with  the  results  of  previously  submitted  studies.  Furthermore,  HbA1c 
reached a nadir at week 12, and from then on increased again. For Stratum 2 results were better, but 
also  modest  and  durability  was  also  a  concern.  This  concern  is  strengthened  by  the  proportion  of 
patients  reaching  goal  HbA1c  <7%:  in  Stratum  1  only  11%  of  patients  reached  that  goal  and  the 
difference  with  placebo  was  not  significant.  In  Stratum  2  22.6%  of  the  patients  reached  that  goal. 
Measures  of  β-cell  function  showed  improvement  with  sitagliptin  therapy,  but  these  effects  may  be 
merely due to improvement of glycaemic control and may not be genuine to sitagliptin. 
In their response to this concern the MAH stated that, in the assessment of the extent and durability of 
glycaemic response, the placebo-corrected glycaemic response to treatment is preferable to the within-
group  change  from  baseline.  In  study  P035,  the  course  of  the  within-group  change  from  baseline  in 
HbA1c in the sitagliptin group is impacted by a number of factors beyond the glycaemic efficacy of 
sitagliptin,  such  as  stability  of  HbA1C  at  baseline,  waning  of  background  therapy,  study  co-
interventions,  such  as  counselling  on  diet  and  exercise  and  the  natural  history  of  T2DM.  Placebo-
correction  permits  proper  evaluation  of  the  impact  of  these  factors  to  be  sorted  out  from  the  direct 
effect of the drug on this endpoint and, hence, more accurately characterizes the efficacy of sitagliptin. 
Based  upon  the  approximately  0.6%  decrease  in  HbA1c  at  Week  24  relative  to  placebo,  the  MAH 
stated that an important benefit with regard to the long-term risk of diabetes complications would be 
expected when sitagliptin is added to a SU agent based on the results of the UKPDS study.  
Examination of the placebo-corrected change from baseline in  HbA1c  also supports the durability of 
effect of sitagliptin over the 24-week treatment period. In Figure 7, placebo-subtracted difference in 
change from baseline in HbA1c is shown for the entire cohort, stratum 1 and stratum 2. The placebo-
corrected  change  continues  to  decrease  after  12  weeks,  reaching  a  nadir  around  Week  18,  with  a 
minimal rise in placebo-subtracted HbA1c change from baseline from Week 18 through Week 24. 
The  rise  in  HbA1c  after  week  12  that  is  seen  in  the  within  group  change,  was  observed  in  both  the 
sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups.  Since  this  rise  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups,  the  MAH 
concluded, that it represents a trial effect, and not deterioration in response to sitagliptin.

Mean ± SE), All-Patients-Treated Population 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  placebo-corrected  response  is  a  proper  measure  of  the 
efficacy  of  sitagliptin  in  study  P035.  The  CHMP  also  agreed  that  a  number  of  factors,  other  than 
efficacy of sitagliptin, will influence the course of HbA1c. Waning of the response to SU might be one 
of these factors, and indeed might be the reason that a rise in HbA1c is seen in study P035, while a 
generally  stable  response  was  seen  in  the  previously  submitted  studies  P020  and  P024,  when 
sitagliptin  was  added  to  metformin.  However,  response  to  the  total  treatment  regimen  is  also 
important,  and  the  CHMP  still  considered  that  total  efficacy  is  modest  in  this  patient  population. 
Although  the  efficacy  of  addition  of  sitagliptin  to  SU  of  Sitagliptin  is  modest,  the  CHMP  is  of  the 
opinion that there might be patients who can benefit of the combination SU+sitagliptin. Therefore, the 
CHMP  concluded  that  the  combination  treatment  of  Sitagliptin  +  SU  could  be  approved,  but  for  a 
restricted population: "to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet 
and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic 
control and when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance”. 
With regards to the triple combination therapy the MAH provided also a detailed rationale in support 
of using the placebo-corrected change from baseline in HbA1c, rather than the within-group change in 
this  parameter,  to  characterise  extent  of  efficacy  and  efficacy  response  over  time.  Placebo-corrected 
HbA1c  change  from  baseline  was  approximately  0.9%  at  week  24  for  stratum  2  with  an  important 
potential benefit with regard to the long-term risk of diabetes complications based on the results of the 
UKPDS  study.  The  placebo-subtracted  difference  in  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  continues  to 
decrease after 12 weeks, reaching a nadir around Week 18, with a minimal rise in placebo-subtracted 
HbA1c change from baseline from Week 18 through Week 24. These results support the durability of 
sitagliptin  as  add-on  to  SU  +  Metformin  over  the  24-week  treatment  period.  The  CHMP  concluded 
that  the  efficacy  was  better  established  in  the  triple  combination  therapy  than  when  sitagliptin  was 
added-on to SU only, although this could be related to the study population. Therefore the indication 
"to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet  and 
exercise  plus  dual  therapy  with  these  agents  do  not  provide  adequate  glycaemic  control"  was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.

As a follow-up the CHMP requested the MAH to study the long-term effects of this combination. 
Therefore the MAH commits “to submit a plan to evaluate the durability of efficacy for the concomitant 
use of sitagliptin with SUs. This proposal could potentially include the large cardiovascular outcome study 
currently being planned.” The MAH will submit their proposal in January 2008. 
2.1.4. Conclusion on efficacy 
It  has  been  shown  that  the  addition  of  sitagliptin  to  glimepiride  alone  or  in  combination  with 
metformin,  results  in  a  significant  reduction  in  HbA1c  compared  to  placebo.  Comparison  with  an 
active control, in particular metformin, is lacking. Discussion focused on the size and durability of the 
effect.  The  size  of  the  effect  is  considered  moderate,  in  particular  when  combined  with  glimepiride 
alone. Assessment of durability is impacted by a number of factors beyond the glycaemic efficacy of 
sitagliptin, but the placebo-subtracted response is still significant after 24 weeks.  
3. 
Clinical safety 
In the entire cohort for Study P035 clinical adverse experiences were reported for 59.5% (132 patients) 
in  the  sitagliptin  treatment  group  and  47.0%  (103  patients)  in  the  placebo  treatment  group  who 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  double-blind  study  medication.  The  higher  incidence  of  adverse 
experiences  overall  appeared  to  be  related  to  small  differences  in  a  range  of  specific  adverse 
experiences—without  a  discernible  pattern—and  to  a  notable  difference  in  the  specific  adverse 
experience of hypoglycaemia. 
In the entire cohort, a total of 31 patients had one or more events of hypoglycaemia: 27 (12.2%) in the 
sitagliptin  group  and  4  (1.8%)  in  the  placebo  group  (p<0.001  for  between-group  difference  in 
proportions).  There  were  55  events  of  hypoglycaemia  in  the  sitagliptin  group,  and  20  events  of 
hypoglycaemia  in  the  placebo  group.  The  incidence  of  patients  having  hypoglycaemic  events  with 
sitagliptin treatment was higher in Stratum 2 than in Stratum 1. In Stratum 1, 7.5% (8 patients) and 
2.8%  (3  patients)  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  had  one  or  more  events  of 
hypoglycaemia; the between-group difference was not statistically significant. In Stratum 2, 16.4% (19 
patients)  and  0.9%  (1  patient)  in  the  sitagliptin  and  placebo  groups  ,  respectively,  had  one  or  more 
hypoglycaemic events (p<0.001 for between-group difference). None of the hypoglycaemia episodes 
met criteria for marked severity or required medical attention, and no patients were discontinued due 
to hypoglycaemia.  Although, the increased hypoglycaemia rate may, at least partially, be explained by 
the  improved  glycaemic  control,  data  on  another  DPP-IV  inhibitor  suggest  that  this  effect  is  dose-
dependent. The higher incidence of hypoglyacemia in Stratum 2 (glimepiride and metformin) than in 
the Stratum 1 (glimepiride alone) of the current study is consistent with the observation that the former 
group of patients had better glycaemic control (HbA1c-lowering) with SITA than the latter group of 
patients. 
Other than the higher incidence of hypoglycaemia, the incidence of drug-related adverse experiences 
was  low,  with  no  more  than  2  patients  (0.9%)  reported  to  have  any  specific  drug-related  adverse 
experience  in  the  sitagliptin  group.  No  meaningful  differences  were  observed  for  the  sitagliptin 
compared  to  the  placebo  group  in  incidence  of  serious  adverse  experiences,  adverse  experiences 
leading  to  discontinuation  (due  to  non-serious  or  serious  adverse  experiences),  or  other  summary 
measures of clinical adverse experiences analysed.  
In the entire cohort, adverse experiences by SOC (System Organ Class) were reported most frequently 
for  Gastrointestinal  Disorders,  Infections  and  Infestations,  Metabolism  and  Nutrition  Disorders, 
Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders,  Nervous  System  Disorders,  and  Respiratory, 
Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders. 
As already observed in the dossier of the initial MAA, SITA was associated with a higher incidence of 
patients  suffering  AEs  (adverse  events)  in  the  system  organ  classes  (SOCs)  “infections  and 
infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and nervous system disorders”. In P035, 
when  sitagliptin  was  added  to  the  regimen  of  patients  inadequately  controlled  on  a  sulphonylurea, 
there was also an increased incidence of patients suffering AEs in the SOCs “metabolism and nutrition 
disorders” due to an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. A similar pattern as for SITA associated

AEs applied to drug-related AEs in the “metabolism and nutrition disorders” SOC (i.e. more patients 
with drug-related hypoglycaemia in the SITA group), and a trend for more patients with drug-related 
AEs  was  also  observed  in  the  “musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders”  SOC.    Adverse 
reactions within the “infections and infestations, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and 
nervous  system  disorders”  SOCs  are  currently  the  subject  of  further  pharmacovigilance  follow-up 
measures (e. g. risk management plan).  
The incidence of laboratory adverse experiences was comparable in the SITA and placebo groups.  
A statistically significant weight increase (mean 1.1 kg) relative to placebo was observed with SITA 
treatment in the entire cohort and in each stratum. Therefore, SITA given in combination with a SU 
may not be as weight neutral as in combination with e.g. metformin but the gain in body weight may 
also be related to the improvement in glycaemic control.  
Noteworthy,  patients  in  the  SITA  group  had  a  higher  prevalence  in  secondary  diagnoses  than  the 
placebo group (i.e. a numerically higher frequency was present in 20 of 25 SOCs). In the 4 SOCs in 
which  the  incidence  of  AEs  within  that  SOC  was  higher  (with  95%  CI  for  the  between-treatment 
group difference not including "0") in the SITA relative to the placebo group (i. e. SOCs “infections 
and infestations, metabolism and nutrition disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, 
nervous  system  disorders”),  a  higher  prevalence  of  medical  history  secondary  diagnoses  was  also 
present in the SITA group.  
3.1. Conclusion on safety  
In  general,  sitagliptin  was  well  tolerated.  More  events  of  hypoglycaemia  were  seen  when  sitagliptin 
was added to SU but they were generally of mild severity and only few patients needed a reduction in 
SU dose.  
4. SPC and PL 
Further to the new indications, the SPC sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 have been updated. Sections 
1, 2 and 4 of the PL have been updated accordingly. 
5. Risk Management Plan 
Within  this  type  II  variation  the  MAH  provided  a  justification  that  there  was  no  need  for  a  revised 
Risk Management Plan. This was considered acceptable for the CHMP as no new safety issues were 
identified and the current version (version 1.1) of the Risk Management Plan adequately addresses the 
risks  related  to  the  dual  combination  therapy  of  SITA+SU  and  the  triple  combination  therapy  of 
SITA+MET+SU. 
6. 
OVERALL CONCLUSION AND BENEFIT-RISK ASSESSMENT 
The  benefit  of  addition  of  sitagliptin  to  SU  or  to  SU+MET  in  terms  of  reduction  of  HbA1c  is 
considered  modest.  However,  there  are  patients  who  can  benefit  of  the  combination  treatment  and 
safety is considered acceptable.  
The  CHMP  is  therefore  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  is  positive  for  a  second  line  dual 
combination therapy of SITA + SU when patients have not responded to a maximal tolerated dose of 
sulfonylurea  and  when  metformin  is  inappropriate  and  for  a  triple  combination  therapy  of  SITA 
+MET+SU: 
• 
• 
to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus 
maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and 
when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin  when  diet 
and exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

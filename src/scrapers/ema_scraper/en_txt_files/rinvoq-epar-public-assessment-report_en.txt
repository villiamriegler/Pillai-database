1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG submitted on 18 December 2018 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Rinvoq, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 February 2017. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0363/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0363/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance upadacitinib contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific advice on 28 January 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/3190/1/2015/III 
CORRIGENDUM) and on 23 March 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/3190/4/2017/I and

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has applied for the following indication: “Rinvoq is indicated for the treatment of 
moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, 
or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Rinvoq may 
be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDs 
(csDMARDs).” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease with an estimated 
prevalence of approximately 1%. RA is more frequent in women. The hallmark feature of RA is 
polyarticular joint swelling and tenderness caused by progressive inflammatory synovitis, which can 
result in severe, debilitating disease. Patients with moderately to severely active RA have persistent 
synovitis with systemic inflammation leading to destruction of articular cartilage and bone, which 
ultimately interfere with function of the joint. Joint destruction often occurs early in the disease 
process and accumulates in an inexorable manner, usually affecting up to 80% of patients within 1 
year of diagnosis. Over time, the impact of this damage increases until it becomes the dominant factor 
driving loss of function. Left untreated, or inadequately treated, progressive functional impairment can 
ultimately lead to significant disability, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Upadacitinib (also known as “ABT-494”, “Upadacitinib AbbVie”, or “Rinvoq”) is an oral JAK inhibitor.  
Inhibition of Janus Kinase (JAK)-mediated pathways is an established approach for the treatment of 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are two other already approved JAK-inhibitors in EU: 
tofacitinib (Xeljanz) and barcitinib (Olumiant). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The proposed indication pertains to 2nd line and beyond treatment of RA either as monotherapy or in 
combination with csDMARD. As described above, RA is a chronic inflammatory, potentially debilitating 
disease. The diagnosis is based on careful history and clinical examination, guided by additional 
procedures such as laboratory testing. Erosions detected by X-ray and positivity for anti-CCP or RF are 
poor prognostic factors. 
2.1.5.  Management 
According to EULAR recommendations (EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid 
arthritis with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: 2016 update), treatment 
should be initiated as soon as the RA diagnosis is made. Treatment should be aimed at reaching a 
target of sustained low disease activity. Methotrexate (MTX) should be the first treatment strategy. In 
patients with contraindications to MTX (or early intolerance), leflunomide or sulfalazine should be 
considered as the (first) line treatment strategy. If there is no improvement by at most 3 months after 
start of treatment or the target has not been reached by 6 months, therapy should be adjusted. 
Depending on whether poor prognostic factors are present or not, other csDMARD or addition of a 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 13/201 
 
 
 
bDMARD (biologic DMARD) or tsDMARD (targeted synthetic DMARD) could then be considered. JAK-
inhibitors are tsDMARD.  
Despite the recent advances in this therapeutic field, there all still patients who either cannot tolerate 
or do not respond to the available treatment options. 
About the product 
Upadacitinib is a new JAK-inhibitor intended for 2nd line and >2nd line treatment of RA either as 
monotherapy or in combination with csDMARD (see above for the complete claimed indication). The 
proposed posology is 15 mg once daily. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application: The application submitted 
is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and clinical data based 
on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain 
test(s) or study(ies). 
The product has not been granted eligibility to PRIME. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

Page 14/201 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Structure of upadacitinib 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, mass 
spectrometry (MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), 1D and 2D 1H- and 13C- nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography.  
Upadacitinib appears as a white to light brown non-hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble 
in water and ethanol. Its partition coefficient (LogP) was determined to be 2.5 and two pKa values 
were determined to be pKa1: 4.7 (nitrogen of the imidazole) and pKa2: 12.8 (amide nitrogen). 
Upadacitinib has two chiral centers and is manufactured as a single stereoisomer. Enantiomeric purity 
is achieved through chiral controls in the manufacturing process and is considered acceptable. 
Upadacitinib exhibits polymorphism. Screening studies identified two forms relevant to the 
manufacturing process of upadacitinib; the hemihydrate form is manufactured by the commercial 
process. XRPD diffraction patterns, have been provided. 
Based on the information provided by the applicant, upadacitinib is considered to be a New Active 
Substance (NAS). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis of upadacitinib comprises six stages and three defined starting materials. The 
intermediates have been defined. Sufficient information regarding the starting material synthesis and 
relevant impurities has been provided for all of them and all three are considered acceptable and are 
controlled by suitable specifications as requested by the CHMP.  
The manufacturing process is well described in the dossier and details of in-process controls and 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are listed for each manufacturing step. The critical process 
parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) are also indicated. 
For all isolated intermediates acceptable specifications were provided. Structures for specified and 
known, unspecified impurities were presented in the dossier. Intermediates from different batches may 
be combined and used in subsequent steps. No recovered materials or solvents are used in the 
process. 
Critical steps of the synthesis have been described and sufficient in process controls are applied. The 
parameters controlling the reaction parameters are presented as set-points or ranges and were 
established by DoE. However, no design spaces are claimed. The manufacturing process and the 
control strategy is described in sufficient detail. Reprocessing would only be undertaken if it can be 
ensured that the reprocessed material would meet the approved specification. In the event of 
reprocessing, the process and sequence of the steps would be repeated as described above.  
The manufacturing process has evolved during the process development. The change of crystallization 
method has been sufficiently investigated and discussed. The different processes produced active 
substance batches that were of comparable quality. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. A thorough discussion of the source, formation and control of 
impurities, including impurities in the regulatory starting materials, impurities generated during the 
manufacturing process (side-products, reagent residues, etc.) and intentionally added catalysts and 
solvents was presented. No Class I solvents are used during the manufacturing process; however,

benzene may be present as an impurity in some solvents used in the manufacturing process. The 
control of benzene is acceptable. 
Stereoisomerism is sufficiently controlled during the synthesis and a test for chiral purity in the 
commercial upadacitinib active substance specification is not considered required to control the quality 
of upadacitinib. 
Upadacitinib active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags sealed with 
nylon cable ties. The inner plastic bag material meets EU Regulation No. 2002/72/EC and subsequent 
amendments as well as EU Pharmacopoeial requirements. Acceptable specifications for the materials 
were presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for description (visual), clarity 
and colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR and HPLC), chiral identification (chiral HPLC), crystal 
form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), impurities (HPLC; 4 methods), mutagenic 
impurities (HPLC-MS), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), elemental impurities (ICP-OES), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), particle size distribution (laser diffraction) and microbiological quality (TAMC and TYMC - Ph. 
Eur.). 
Mutagenic impurities are acceptably controlled according to ICH M7. Upon request of the CHMP, the 
applicant adjusted the limits for all specified impurities according to ICH Q3A. The limit for individual 
unspecified impurities is also set in line with ICH Q3A.  ICH Q3C limits are applied for residual solvents. 
For mutagenic impurities, the acceptable intake is 1.5 µg/day, considering possible treatment periods 
longer than 10 years. Based on a 60 mg/day maximum dose of upadacitinib, the 1.5 μg/day limit 
corresponds to 25 ppm for each mutagenic or potentially mutagenic impurity. The active substance 
specification limit for mutagenic impurities is 20 ppm. 
Upadacitinib batches from the proposed process were tested for Class 1 and Class 2A elemental 
impurities identified in ICH Q3D Guideline. Based on the results, a test for Class 1 and 2A elemental 
impurities in the commercial active substance specification is not required to control the quality of 
upadacitinib. The only specified elemental impurity, is acceptably controlled according to ICH Q3D. 
As shown by batch data and based on synthesis considerations, a test for chiral purity in the 
commercial upadacitinib active substance specification is not considered necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch data from 28 batches of varying size, including commercial scale batches, used for clinical 
studies and in the stability program, was presented. The batches were manufacture by the commercial 
method or the second most recent manufacturing method. The batches were tested according to the 
current specification at the time of their manufacture. Although different analytical methods have been 
used, the presented results show little variation. The batch data provided is considered to be sufficient. 
Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data on six production scale batches of active substance stored in the intended commercial 
packaging for up to 12 months under long term conditions 30 °C / 75 % RH, and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions 40 °C / 75 % RH was provided. Additional stability data from three

Page 16/201 
 
 
 
further commercial batches manufactured at the development site stored for up to 9 months under 
long-term conditions 30 °C / 75 % RH and 6 months under accelerated conditions 40 °C / 75 % was 
also provided. The stability conditions were according to the ICH guidelines except for the relative 
humidity during long-term studies, which was set at 75 % instead of 65 %. The first six stability 
batches (primary) were manufactured with the proposed synthesis but with slightly different 
crystallization parameters; the additional three stability batches were manufactured with the proposed 
route with optimized crystallization. The stability batches were packaged in the commercial primary 
packaging. 
The following parameters were evaluated: description, crystal form, assay, impurities, water content 
and microbiological quality (TAMC and TYMC). The methods were the same as for release. The 
reported results show no trends, only minor fluctuations, and remain essentially unchanged over the 
studied time points currently available (long-term and accelerated, respectively). The results from 
long-term and accelerated studies are similar. However, for one batch a decreasing assay value has 
been reported during accelerated conditions, but the lower value was still within the assay specification 
limits at the time. 
A photostability study was conducted according to ICH Q1B on three commercial scale batches. No 
significant degradation was observed; the results support the conclusion that the active substance 
does not need protection from light.  
Stress testing was performed on samples in solid state and in solution that were subjected to stressed 
conditions (UV light, oxidation, acid, base, heat and humidity). No significant degradation was 
observed in forced degradation studies and primarily occurred in samples exposed to acidic, basic or 
oxidation conditions.  The analytical methods were shown to be stability indicating. 
Based on the provided data, the proposed retest period of 24 months, with storage in the proposed 
commercial container closure system at or below 30 °C, is accepted. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as an oblong, biconvex film-coated prolonged-release tablet 
containing 15 mg of upadacitinib. The tablet has a purple colour and the dimensions are 14.0 mm x 
8.0 mm. The tablet debossed “a15” on one side.  
A  systematic  quality  risk  based  approach  has  been  followed  during  development.  The  quality  target 
product profile (QTPP) has been defined and relating critical quality parameters (CQAs) were presented. 
Considering the potential CQAs, risk assessments were performed to evaluate the impact on CQAs of 
risk factors related to formulation, process and packaging. The risk assessment was revisited after 
completion of development. Potential risks have been identified, assessed and actions have been 
taken, where needed, to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. The proposed control strategy is 
considered satisfactory. The CQA identified for upadacitinib tablets were: identity, purity, assay, 
uniformity of dosage units, degradation products, dissolution, microbiological quality, water content, 
appearance. 
Upadacitinib is classified as highly soluble substance according to BCS. The choice of the crystalline 
free base hemihydrate form for development has been justified.  All the excipients used are common in 
tablet formulations as well as the film-coating agents. The excipients including those of the film-
coating agent are of compendial quality. The function of each excipient was discussed and justified.  
Assessment report

Page 17/201 
 
 
 
The development of three strengths is described (7.5, 15 and 30 mg), but only the 15 mg strength is 
intended for marketing.  
In PhI and PhII clinical trials, immediate release capsule formulations with an upadacitinib salt were 
used. For PhIII, a prolonged release tablet based on the earlier capsule formulations was targeted to 
allow for once daily dosing. One of the formulations evaluated was selected on the basis of its PK 
profile for further development of the PhIII 7.5, 15 mg and 30 mg tablet formulations. HPMC level in 
the final formulation was defined so that it enables comparable exposure to the IR capsules used in 
PhI/PhII clinical studies. Several changes were done to the PhIII product in the establishment of the 
proposed commercial formulation and these were clearly presented and justified. The pivotal 
bioequivalence study (Study M15-878) has been conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of the 
commercial formulation compared to the formulation used in Phase 3 studies. The tested formulations 
were found bioequivalent. 
Discoloration (mottling) of the tablet surface has been observed over storage but this is not due to the 
active substance as the same occurs to placebo tablets stored under similar conditions to the active 
containing tablets. Except for a change in appearance, the stability of the drug product is unaffected by 
the appearance of mottling. Water content limits of the tablets are specified to minimize the 
occurrence of mottling. Protection from water was found to prevent mottling of the final product. 
Desiccant is incorporated in all bottle packaging. To limit water uptake in blisters, a more water-
protective grade of blister material has been utilized. 
Dissolution method development and IVIVC 
The development of the proposed dissolution method intended for quality control (QC) has been 
sufficiently described. The proposed method is basket apparatus, 100rpm, 900 ml 0.05M sodium 
phosphate, pH 6.8.   
The sensitivity of dissolution method with regard to changes in the properties of HPMC was assessed 
using different lots of HPMC in the extragranular portion of the tablet. Particle size, viscosity and 
substitution percentage of hydroxypropoxy groups and methoxy groups were also investigated.   
A level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) was successfully developed for the product on the 30 mg 
strength. Four formulations were tested to investigate the relationship between in vitro dissolution and 
the corresponding in vivo performance. The formulation had similar compositions except for the 
proportion of the rate controlling polymer (HPMC) and the mannitol content used to compensate for 
the difference in HPMC amount. A non-linear model was developed based on the QC dissolution 
method. The discriminating power of the dissolution method is considered to be shown by the 
successful establishment of a level A IVIVC. Therefore, no additional studies were performed to further 
demonstrate discriminating power of the method against either formulation or manufacturing 
parameters. With the establishment of the IVIVC, the dissolution test has been demonstrated to be 
predictive of in vivo performance (clinically relevant) and during development it has been used to 
assess drug product performance when changes are made to material attributes and manufacturing 
process parameters. 
The IVIVC model showed acceptable predictability of the plasma concentration-time curves. 
Furthermore, internal and external validation resulted in prediction errors within the acceptance criteria 
defined in the EMA guideline. It can be concluded that the proposed dissolution method is suitable for 
use as part of the overall analytical testing for assessing the quality of the drug product, is predictive 
of in vivo performance, is clinically relevant and can be used as a surrogate for bioavailability in 
obtaining bioavailability/ bioequivalence waivers.  
The IVIVC established for the 30 mg strength it has been shown to be applicable also to the 15 mg 
product and therefore applicable for evaluation of future changes to the product. Thus, it would be 
Assessment report

possible to use dissolution data to establish bioequivalence of formulations provided that the change 
results in a product dissolution profile within the studied range and does not involve any modifications 
of the parameters governing the release mechanism of the product – i.e. the diffusion/erosion.     
Effect of alcohol on product performance 
The risk of dose dumping due to the presence of alcohol was assessed. Drug release was slowed down 
by the presence of alcohol and based on this dose dumping from consumption of alcohol by the patient 
is not expected. 
Manufacturing process development  
The manufacturing process changes from PhIII clinical trial material to the proposed commercial 
process has been presented. The commercial scale manufacturing process was developed in laboratory 
and pilot scale at a development site whilst the commercial development was concluded at the 
proposed site. Bioequivalence between the PhIII and commercial tablets has however been 
demonstrated. Changes in the process between the manufacture of stability batches and 
commercialization have been discussed and the stability batches are considered to be representative.  
Process operating ranges for selected parameters were presented and their establishment discussed. 
QbD principles have been applied and both OVAT and DoE methodologies used. The process is 
operated with PARs for milling, blending and tableting unit operations and with design spaces for 
granulation and film-coating. The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch 
analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed design spaces.  
The product is packaged either in HDPE bottles with desiccant, induction sealed and child resistant 
propylene cap, or in polyvinyl chloride/ polyethylene/ polychlorotrifluoroethene polymer blisters with 
push through aluminium foil. Specifications were provided for all packaging materials and compliance 
with relevant EU legislation has been confirmed for the blister packaging materials and the bottle pack. 
It has also been confirmed that the bottle with child resistant closure complies with ISO8317.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six unit operations: granulation, milling, blending, tableting, 
coating and packaging. The process concerns a modified release formulation but it has been accepted 
as a standard process based on the experience of the proposed manufacturing site with similar 
products and processes, as per the Process Validation guideline. 
Critical steps have been appropriately identified.  The in-process controls and their applied limits are 
specified and adequately explained. Design spaces have been proposed for the granulation and coating 
steps of the manufacturing process of the medicinal product. The design spaces have been developed 
at commercial scale and are accepted. 
The overall control strategy for Rinvoq tablets is considered satisfactory and ensures sufficient control 
of the process which is expected to produce tablets with consistent quality. 
Process hold times have been established for the milled granulate, final blend, uncoated and coated 
tablets based on relevant stability studies. The packaging materials have been described. Additionally, 
a 1-year bulk hold time is proposed.  The applicant has confirmed that the hold times are included in 
the product shelf life in line with ‘Note for Guidance on Start of Shelf-Life of the Finished Dosage Form’ 
(CPMP/QWP/072/96) and this is accepted. 
With regard to process validation, it has been argued and accepted that, based on previous experience 
with similar products, the gained knowledge of the specific product during development and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 19/201 
 
 
 
manufacturing site previous experience with the specific process, the process validation can be 
completed before commercialisation. An acceptable protocol has been presented. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification (UV, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), water 
content (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur.) and Uniformity of Dosage (Ph. Eur.).  
The specifications are in accordance with ICH Q6A. The acceptance criteria are set based on a 
combination of batch data, clinical experience, manufacturing and analytical aspects, knowledge 
gained during development and regulatory guidelines. The justifications provided are acceptable. Limits 
for degradation products are in line with ICH Q3B and thus no further qualification in non-
clinical/clinical studies is warranted.  
The risk assessment for elemental impurities based on ICH Q3D option 2b and a maximum daily dose 
of one tablet shows that the estimated maximum daily exposure levels of all potential elemental 
impurities were less than the ICH Q3D control threshold level (30% of the PDE). The risk assessment 
is supported by batch data from twelve representative production scale batches of upadacitinib tablets. 
It is therefore accepted that no controls of elemental impurities are needed in the finished product 
specification.  
Microbial limits, residual solvents and mutagenic impurities are not included in the finished product 
specification. These quality attributes will instead be ensured through upstream controls. Also based on 
the presented development data, control of polymorphic form in the finished product specification is 
not needed. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of 
finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 5 commercial scale batches of 15 mg tablets manufactured at the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site have been provided. Supportive data from13 smaller scale batches 
were also presented. Based on the batch analysis data the finished product meets the proposed 
specifications and therefore indicate consistent manufacture of the finished product. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of Rinvoq tablets 15 mg stored in the proposed 
blisters and bottles packaging for up to 18 months under long-term conditions at 30 °C ± 2 °C / 75% 
± 5% RH and at 25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% ± 5% RH and under accelerated conditions 40 °C ± 2 °C / 75% 
± 5% RH for six months has been presented according to ICH guideline. 
Supportive stability data from three batches of each strength (7.5 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg) 
manufactured at least at one-fourth the commercial scale at the development facility were also 
presented and these are regarded representative of the commercial process. These batches were 
stored both in blisters and bottles for up to 24 months under long-term conditions at 30 °C ± 2 °C / 
75% ± 5% RH and at 25 °C ± 2 °C / 60% ± 5% RH and for six months under accelerated conditions 
40 °C ± 2 °C / 75% ± 5% RH according to ICH guideline. 
Storage at 30°C/75% RH is considered as worst case compared to ICH 25°C/60% RH or 30°C/65% RH. 
Samples have been tested against the product specification. No significant changes in any of the 
quality attributes monitored were seen after storage at either long term or accelerated conditions. 
Some out of specifications results have been satisfactorily investigated and the root cause has been

EMA/608624/2019

Page 20/201 
 
 
 
identified. It is not considered that any concern remains about the stability of the product in relation to 
these observations.  The analytical methods adequately support the product specifications. 
It has been shown that the change in appearance does not occur under the proposed storage 
conditions and does not affect any other product quality attributes.  
Photostability 
The ICH photostability studies as per ICH Q1B were performed for 3 commercial scale batches of each 
tablet strength. The samples were tested for description, degradation products, assay, water content, 
and dissolution. No meaningful change was observed for tablets exposed without the primary 
packaging. The product does not need protection from light. 
In-use stability 
In-use stability was performed for the bottle pack using commercial bottles and caps. One study was 
performed on the commercial scale batches. A second study was performed with supportive batches. 
The samples were tested for description, degradation products, assay, water content, and dissolution. 
Periodic testing of microbiological quality (TAMC and TYMC) was also performed. Water content 
increased in the study where the desiccant had been removed. With no desiccant present, a known 
degradation product was formed. The increase in water content (with desiccant present) did not impact 
stability, quality or performance of the tablets as measured by the other tested attributes and a one 
month in-use shelf life is therefore supported.  
Forced degradation studies 
Forced degradation studies were performed on the 7.5 and 30 mg tablet. Samples were exposed to 
heat, heat/humidity, light, hydrolysis (acid and base) and oxidation.  
Some cases of mass balance discrepancies in the results were satisfactorily explained. A greater impact 
on overall mass balance is seen for the lower strength tablet due to a more extensive degradation. No 
significant degradation was observed under light. Upon exposure to oxidative, acid and base 
conditions, the total impurities were slightly increased. Degradation was more prominent for heat and 
heat/humidity stress conditions. The major degradant under heat, heat/humidity, acid and base stress 
conditions were found to be two known impurities.  The methods were shown to be stability indicating 
Temperature cycling 
One batch per strength per package type was exposed to temperature cycling experiments comprising 
5 cycles shifting between -20 °C and 50 °C followed by storage for 6 months at 30 °C / 75% RH. 
Testing included description, degradation products, assay, water content and dissolution. No 
meaningful changes were observed during the temperature cycling period. After the additional 6 
months storage, the 7.5 mg strength product packaged in blisters showed some degradation which 
was not observed in the other product strengths. Based on the stability data, temperature cycling of -
20°C for 15 days, and 50°C for 15 days is not cause of concern for the quality for upadacitinib tablets 
stored in film blisters and bottles with desiccant. 
Based on the data presented, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and without any special temperature 
storage conditions and “Store in an original package” in order to protect from moisture, is acceptable 
(SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4). 
Adventitious agents 
No excipient or materials of animal or human origin are used. Magnesium stearate are derived from 
vegetable source.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has 
applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product and their 
manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for two steps in the manufacture of the 
finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pivotal toxicology and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with GLP 
regulations and ICH guidelines. 
CHMP scientific advice have been given to the nonclinical development of upadacitinib (see Section 1). 
The given advices have been in general followed. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Mechanism of action 
In rheumatoid arthritis the pathogenic role of inflammatory cytokines is well known. The JAK family is 
composed of 4 family members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). These cytoplasmic 
tyrosine kinases are associated with membrane cytokine receptors to mediate signalling downstream of 
multiple cytokines and growth factors. Activation of JAK pathways initiates expression of survival 
factors and enhances production of additional cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that 
facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, all of which contribute to the pathogenesis 
of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Hence, inhibitors of JAK are of interest for the 
treatment rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as for the treatment of other immune-mediated 
inflammatory disorders.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
The potency of upadacitinib on recombinant JAK family kinase domains was determined in isolated 
human enzyme complexes using biochemical assays in vitro with adenosine-5´-triphosphate (ATP) as a 
competitive inhibitor (0.1 mM ATP). The results indicated that upadacitinib is a reversible ATP 
competitive inhibitor and upadacitinib inhibited JAK1 and JAK2 with IC50 of 0.043 μM and 0.12 µM, 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 22/201 
 
 
 
while exhibiting less potent activity against JAK3 (IC50 = 2.3 µM) and TYK2 (IC50 =4.7 μM) 
complexes, respectively. Thus, the potency of upadacitinib on JAK1 and JAK2 at the enzyme level was 
relatively similar. Both JAK1 and JAK2 could therefore potentially be targeted at clinical exposure level 
(Cmax = 105 nM). 
Effects and cellular potency of upadacitinib on JAK inhibition was investigated in three different human 
cell lines. In human T-blast cells, upadacitinib inhibited IL-2 induced phosphorylation of STAT5 (JAK1/3 
dependent readout) with EC50 of 13 nM. Moreover, upadacitinib inhibited IL-6 induced phosphorylation 
of STAT3 (JAK1/JAK2 dependent readout) in human erythroleukaemia TF-1 cells with an EC50 value of 
9 nM. To evaluate the effects of upadacitinib on JAK2 inhibition in a cellular context, inhibition of EPO-
induced phosphorylation of STAT5 in the human EPO dependent megakaryoblastic leukemic UT-7 cells 
was studied. Upadacitinib inhibited EPO induced phosphorylation STAT5 with an EC50 of 628 nM. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
Potency of upadacitinib in vivo was evaluated in acute concanavalin A (Con A) induced IFNγ in male 
Lewis rats, which is considered a JAK1 dependent mechanism by the applicant. However, it’s noted 
that Con A-induced IFNγ release may also trigger activation of JAK2 dependent mechanisms. Single 
oral administration of upadacitinib (0.1-10 mg/kg, 30 min prior to Con A; 10 mg/kg, IV) was shown to 
dose-dependently inhibit the release of IFNγ in rat plasma with an ED50 and ED80 of 0.4 mg/kg and 
5.8 mg/kg, respectively. The efficacy of upadacitinib to reduce inflammation was assessed in an 
adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model in female Lewis rats in vivo. Oral doses of upadacitinib (0.1 to 
10 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days) resulted in a dose and exposure-dependent reduction in paw 
swelling and bone erosion at an efficacious total plasma concentration of 85 ng•hr/mL (AUC0-12hr), 
which is approximately 5-fold lower compared to the clinical steady state exposure of 420 ng*h/ml 
(AUC0-24hr) in RA patients. In conclusion, the in vivo results demonstrate that oral dosing of 
upadacitinib is able to inhibit an inflammatory phenotype after induction of experimental arthritis in 
rats. 
To evaluate the in vivo selectivity of upadacitinib, the level of JAK inhibition in rat whole blood samples 
ex vivo was investigated following IL-7 stimulation of STAT5 phosphorylation. In female rats, orally 
dosed upadacitinib (1-100 mg/kg, PO) inhibited IL-7 induced pSTAT5, a JAK1 and JAK 3 mechanistic 
endpoint, with an IC50 value of about 20 nM. Furthermore, the ability of repeated oral dosing of 
upadacitinib (0.3-30 mg/kg, PO, BID for two weeks) to inhibit circulating NK cells numbers, due to 
inhibition of JAK3 activity, was studied in Spraque Dawley rats. Orally dosed upadacitinib for two 
weeks reduced circulating NK cells numbers, a PD biomarker for JAK3 inhibition, by 50 % with an 
AUC0-12hr of 520 ng•hr/mL. Taken together, the presented data indicate that, at clinically relevant 
exposure, upadacitinib is an inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK3 dependent signalling in vivo. Functional 
selectivity of upadacitinib over TyK2 was not evaluated in an in vivo setting. Although upadacitinib was 
designed to selectively inhibit JAK1 activity, while minimizing effects on JAK2 and JAK3, its selectivity 
profile for the JAK family is questionable. At the enzyme level the potency of upadacitinib on JAK1 and 
JAK2 was relatively similar and upadacitinib was able to inhibit JAK3 dependent activity at clinically 
relevant exposure. In addition, similar to findings reported for other non-selective JAK inhibitors, the 
results from the toxicity studies, including effects on the hematologic system (decreased lymphocytes 
and RBC mass) at concentration at or slightly above clinical exposure, indicate a broad JAK inhibitory 
effect of upadacitinib.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Binding selectivity of upadacitinib against a panel of over 70 human protein kinases was investigated in 
a broad kinome selectivity screen. Of the kinases in the panel, six non-JAK kinases showed an IC50 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 23/201 
 
 
 
below 5 μM, and two non-JAK kinases had IC50s equal to or below 1 μM (Rock1 at 1 μM and Rock2 at 
0.42 μM). Thus, upadacitinib appears to be selective against a number of different non-JAK kinases 
and upadacitinib seems unlikely to interact with the tested kinases at clinically relevant exposures 
(Cmax =105 nM). 
Upadacitinib was profiled for its off-target activity against a broad panel of 79 different receptors, ion 
channels, enzymes and transporters. Upadacitinib (10 µM) did not affect control specific binding by 
greater than 50% at any of the different receptors, ion channels or transporters tested. The results 
indicate a low risk for off target activity with upadacitinib at therapeutic plasma concentrations (clinical 
Cmax = 105 nM). 
Safety pharmacology 
Upadacitinib was assessed in a series of GLP compliant safety pharmacology studies in vitro and in 
vivo. The CNS/neurobehavioral safety profile was evaluated in rats. In a Functional Observational 
Battery (FOB) assay in female rats, upadacitinib (10, 50, 100 mg/kg, PO) did not induce any 
neurobehavioral effects at the oral doses of 10 mg/kg (Cmax = 0.47 µg/mL) and 50 mg/kg (Cmax = 5.2 
µg/mL, yielding an exposure margin of 126-fold above clinical Cmax. At the highest dose of 100 mg/kg 
(Cmax = 13.5 µg/mL), upadacitinib produced a significant decrease in locomotor activity. 
The respiratory effects of upadacitinib were investigated in the rat using whole body plethysmography. 
After a single oral gavage administration of upadacitinib (10, 50, 100 mg/kg, PO) in male rats, there 
was no effect on respiratory rate, tidal volume or minute volume through 100 mg/kg (Cmax = 3.9 
µg/mL, providing an exposure margin of 95-fold above clinical Cmax (41 ng/mL). 
In the hERG assay, upadacitinib was evaluated in stably transfected HEK293 cells at concentrations of 
6.7, 20 and 60 µg/mL, which produced concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG tail current from 15 
to 59%. The IC50 for hERG blockade was 39.5 μg/mL, which is several hundred-fold above clinical 
plasma concentrations. 
In vivo cardiac safety pharmacology (telemetry) studies were performed in conscious dogs. Oral dosing 
of upadacitinib (0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/kg, PO) had no effects on electrophysiological parameters (heart 
rate, PR, QRS and QTc intervals) or mean arterial blood pressure at 0.5 mg/kg (NOAEL, Cmax = 0.09 
µg/mL; exposure margins of 2-fold above clinical Cmax). At higher doses of 1.5 mg/kg (Cmax = 0.42 
µg/mL) and 5 mg/kg, upadacitinib dose-dependently decreased mean arterial blood pressure (~15% 
and ~19%, respectively). At the highest dose of 5 mg/kg (Cmax = 1.3 µg/mL), upadacitinib increased 
heart rate by ~30%. In addition, in a non-GLP compliant cardiac safety pharmacology study in the 
anesthetized dog, intravenous infusion of upadacitinib (0.06, 0.19 and 0.58 mg/kg, IV) for 30 minutes 
produced no cardiovascular effects through 0.25 µg/mL (exposure margins of 6-fold above clinical 
Cmax). At a higher plasma concentration of 0.64 µg/mL, upadacitinib reduced systemic vascular 
resistance (13%) and increased heart rate (14 beats per minute).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with upadacitinib. This is 
considered acceptable by CHMP.

Upadacitinib was quantified by a common salt-assisted liquid-liquid extraction technique prior to high 
performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis of plasma 
samples of mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog from GLP compliant toxicity studies. Metabolites in plasma, 
urine, feces, bile, hepatocyte and liver microsomes and hepatocytes from mouse, rat and dog ADME 
studies were separated by HPLC and identified and structurally elucidated by MS/MS. Radiometric 
methods used to measure [14C]upadacitinib-derived radioactivity in samples from in vivo studies (bile, 
urine, feces and plasma) and from in vitro studies (liver microsomes and hepatocyte incubations) were 
fit for the purpose. 
The validations of the bioanalytical methods used for quantification of upadacitinib in pivotal toxicity 
studies appear not to have been performed according to GLP. At the CHMP’s request, the applicant 
clarified that the bioanalytical method validation was, in general, conducted in accordance with 
regulatory guidelines for bioanalytical method and appeared to have followed GLP standards with 
exception for a signed GLP compliant statements and some limitations in QA inspections regarding the 
validation process. However, the QA unit reviewed all aspects of the implementation of the analytical 
methods used in the toxicology studies. Thus, the deviations are not considered by the CHMP to have 
impact on the results in the pivotal GLP toxicity studies. 
Absorption 
The single dose pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib were characterised in mouse, rats, dogs and 
cynomolgus monkeys following IV or oral dosing. Upadacitinib was rapidly absorbed after a single oral 
dose, with mean Tmax  in plasma ranging from 1 to 2 h in rats, dogs and monkeys, which is similar to 
Tmax in humans (mean of 1.2 h). Mean oral bioavailability was moderate in rat (30.5%) and higher in 
monkey (59.3%) and in dog (76.8%). Oral bioavailability was not reported in humans.  
The plasma clearance following single intravenous administration were high in rat (CL 2.0 L/hr•kg), but 
lower in monkey (1.2 L/hr•kg) and dog (0.66 L/hr•kg). The mean plasma elimination half-lives ranged 
from 1.3 hours in monkey to ~3 hours in rat and dog following single oral dosing of upadacitinib.  
Volumes of distribution (Vss) were high in all species (1.6-2.6 L/kg).   
Following repeated daily oral dosing in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs the exposures (AUC) were not 
different from that measured on Day 1 in all species. There were no significant sex differences in 
upadacitinib exposures in mice and dogs, but in rats, AUC values in females were consistently higher 
than in males. In all species, the upadacitinib exposure (Cmax and AUC value) were greater than 
proportional to the administered oral doses. The observed nonlinearity in non-clinical species was 
hypothesized by the applicant to be dose related mechanisms of absorption. 
Distribution 
The tissue distribution of total radioactivity in pigmented rats following single oral administration of 
[14C]upadacitinib was evaluated by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). 
Upadacitinib derived radioactivity was widely and rapidly distributed to most tissues with highest tissue 
concentrations between 0.5- and 4-hours postdose. Liver, uveal tract and adrenal gland contained 
some of the highest concentrations of radioactivity observed. The elimination of radioactivity from 
most tissues was complete by 24 hours postdose, with exceptions for the arterial wall, cecum, uveal 
tract, eye, intervertebral discs, kidney, large intestine, liver and pigmented skin having measurable 
levels of radioactivity between 48 and 168 hours postdose. Radioactivity concentrations were below 
measurable levels in the CNS tissues and the lens of the eye at all collection times throughout the 
study. Radioactivity was present in the uveal tract through 192 hours postdose and a slower clearance 
in pigmented skin indicating an apparent affinity for melanin.

Plasma protein binding of upadacitinib was low in all species and independent of concentration from 
0.1 to 100 µM, as determined by equilibrium dialysis. The mean unbound fraction (fu) at 1 µM was 
0.28, 0.41, 0.69, 0.47 and 0.48 in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively. 
Upadacitinib partitioning into red blood cells was slightly higher in rat, dog and monkey (blood to 
plasma ratios 1.28, 1.18 and 1.31, respectively), with no preferential distribution in mouse and human 
(blood to plasma ratios of 0.99 and 1.00, respectively). 
In pregnant rats, upadacitinib was transferred through the placenta of pregnant rats with measurable 
concentrations observed in foetal blood and liver through 4 hours following oral dosing. Concentrations 
in foetal blood were 1 to 10% of the concentration in maternal blood up to 4 hours post-dose and then 
above the maternal blood concentration up to the last sampling at 72 hours post-dose. 
In lactating rats upadacitinib was excreted in milk with measurable concentrations of radioactivity 
observed in milk through the 24-hour time point with a half-life of 2.8 hours. The concentration of 
upadacitinib-derived radioactivity in milk was approximately 31 times higher than in plasma. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of upadacitinib was evaluated in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of mouse, 
rat, dog, monkey and human and in vivo in rat, dog and human, respectively.  
In vitro 
The metabolic stability of upadacitinib was evaluated in hepatocytes across species at a single 1 μM 
concentration. The scaled intrinsic clearance of upadacitinib was 25.6, 4.07, 0.413, 0.415 and 0.366 
L/h/kg in mouse, rat, monkey, dog and human hepatocytes, respectively. Metabolite enzyme 
phenotyping in vitro using incubations with a panel of recombinant human cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(CYPs) and flavin monooxygenases (FMOs) showed that upadacitinib (2 µM) was metabolized by 
CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP3A5.  
Whereas the metabolism of upadacitinib was thoroughly investigated in vitro in microsomes 
hepatocytes of mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human and in vivo in rat, dog and human, there are no 
metabolism data in rabbit. As rabbit is used for the embryo-foetal developmental (EFD) studies the 
applicant was asked by CHMP to justify why such data have not been presented. The applicant has 
provided results on the metabolism of upadacitinib in rabbit liver microsomes. In line with the in vitro 
data obtained in other non-clinical species (rat and dog) as well as in humans, there was a low 
turnover of upadacitinib in rabbits and the oxidative rabbit metabolites M2, M6 and M10 (A-1745477) 
replicate those found in rat, dog and human. The applicant has not identified any new upadacitinib-
related metabolites in rabbit liver microsomes as compared to the metabolites that had previously 
been identified in rat, dog or human. The justification was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
In vivo 
Following a single oral dose in human of [14C]upadacitinib (30 mg) unchanged compound was the 
major radiochemical component of drug-related material in plasma, representing 79.4% of total 
radioactivity.  M4 and M11 were identified in plasma, representing 13.4% and 7.1% of total plasma 
radioactivity, respectively. The glucuronide metabolite M4 was characterized as a major metabolite in 
human plasma, whereas M11 was a minor human metabolite. No further evaluation is warranted for 
the metabolite M4 since the M4 metabolite is a Phase II conjugate which is not a chemically reactive 
acyl glucuronide.

Following oral dosing in rats of [14C]upadacitinib (3 mg/kg, PO), 56.3% of the dose was recovered as 
parent (18.5% in bile, 8.9% in urine, 7.5% in cage wash, 21.4% in feces), while 37.4% of the dose 
was excreted as metabolites. These data suggest that both metabolism and excretion of parent drug 
contribute equally to the elimination of upadacitinib. 
In male beagle dogs, parent drug was the major radiochemical component in plasma (87.7%) following 
a single 5 mg/kg oral dose of [14C]upadacitinib. 
Upadacitinib was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP3A5. 
Parent drug was major component in plasma (82.8%) in lactating rats, with low concentrations of M1, 
M2, M11 and M22. 
Excretion 
Majority of upadacitinib is excreted as intact in the all species (61% in rats, 56% in dogs). Mass 
balance data were obtained from rats, dogs and humans. Overall, the results indicate that elimination 
pathways for upadacitinib in non-clinical species and humans (for details see Clinical Pharmacokinetics) 
are similar; the majority of absorbed drug-related radioactivity being eliminated by excretion into 
biliary/fecal or renal routes whereas hepatic metabolism plays a secondary role. In bile cannulated 
rats, 49.7% of an intravenous dose was recovered in the bile, with 23.7% of the dose recovered in the 
urine. In dog, drug related radioactivity was eliminated in feces (54.6%) and urine (46.9%). In the 
human radiolabeled mass balance study which administered the immediate release solution 
formulation, a mean of 53.4% of the dose was recovered in feces and 42.6% was recovered in urine. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Please refer to Section 2.4.2. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Relevance of animal models 
The Sprague Dawley rat and Beagle dog were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent species in 
the general toxicity studies. The Sprague Dawley rat and Tg(HRAS) mouse were selected for the 
carcinogenicity studies. The reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in 
Sprague Dawley rat and New Zealand White rabbit. 
The selection was based on the systemic exposure in rats and dogs which was much higher than in 
other investigated species. As discussed in the pharmacokinetics section, these species were shown to 
have similar elimination pathways and metabolic profiles of upadacitinib as in humans and are thus 
considered adequate for safety evaluation of upadacitinib. There are however no metabolism data 
presented in the rabbit, which is used in a pivotal EFD study. See further discussion in the 
pharmacokinetic section. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Upadacitinib was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice (4 weeks with no recovery), rats (4 
weeks with 4 weeks recovery, and 26 weeks with no recovery), and dogs (4 weeks with 4 weeks 
recovery, and 39 weeks with no recovery). 
The main organs affected in the repeat-dose toxicity studies were primarily those related to JAK 
inhibition, that is the haematopoietic and immune system.

Morbidity and mortality 
Upadacitinib was not tolerated in mice and rats at high doses. In a non-pivotal study in mice several 
animals were found dead 3-5 hours after administered a dose of 70 or 100 mg/kg. In the 1-month 
pivotal repeat dose study in rats, all animals in the high dose group (200 mg/kg) were either found 
dead or euthanized in moribund condition on day 1-3 of the study. Also 5 males in the 100 mg/kg 
group were euthanized. The animals were observed with reduced activity, weakness, low skin turgor, 
moderately laboured breathing, and loss of righting reflex. Microscopic evaluation revealed findings in 
liver, spleen, thymus and kidney. The measured Cmax in the remaining male and female animals in 
the 100 mg/kg group was 5.72 and 14.9 µg/mL, and the AUC0-24 40.8 and 63.8 µg*hr/mL. This 
corresponds to at least 140 times the maximum concentration measured in patients (41 ng/mL) and 
97 times the exposure based on AUC (420 ng*h/mL). The mortalities can thus be considered of limited 
clinical relevance although the observed microscopic findings were also observed in lower dose groups, 
but of a lesser magnitude. 
Body weight and food consumption 
Administration of upadacitinib was associated with decreased body weight in rats (20 mg/kg/day) at x9 
times the systemic exposure compared to exposure in patients. In the carcinogenicity study in rats, 
body weight decrease was observed also at lower doses. 
No effects on body weight or food consumption were observed in the studies in dogs. 
Immune system 
In all the repeat-dose toxicity studies effects consistent with the inhibition of JAK1/3 were observed. 
The findings included decreases in circulating lymphocytes and lymphoid depletion in spleen, thymus, 
and lymph nodes. 
After 4 weeks of daily administration in rats, lymphocyte levels had decreased by 70% compared to 
control values at the highest dose (approximately x100 times the exposure observed in patients), but 
also at a ten times lower dose (x3 times the clinical exposure) lymphocyte levels was 30-44% lower 
than in the control animals. In male animals at this dose, neutrophil levels were 20% lower than in 
controls. In the 6-month study, similar levels of reductions were observed in lymphocytes and 
eosinophils at approximately clinical relevant exposures. Lymphocyte levels were decreased also in the 
1-month dog study (-37%) at systemic exposures corresponding to approximately x10 times the 
clinical exposure. In the 9-month study the high dose group (approximately x2 the clinical exposure) 
the white blood cell count was increased. This increase was mainly ascribed to increases in individual 
neutrophil counts which was consistent with findings of chronic swelling and inflammation correlated 
with infestation of mites (see below). 
At doses from 5 mg/kg (clinical exposure) in rat the weight of the spleen and thymus was decreased. 
Decreased numbers of lymphocytes in spleen and thymus was observed from 5 mg/kg. Lymphoid 
depletion from the lymph nodes was observed from 20 mg/kg. These findings were observed at lower 
doses in male animals compared to female animals.  
Altered immune function-secondary effects 
In dogs, the main manifestation of immunosuppression was the occurrence of infections. In the 9-
month study, demodicosis (Demodex infection) was confirmed in all animals in the high dose group 
(1.5 mg/kg, x2 clinical exposure). Demodex is a mite considered to be normal flora of the dog skin 
which is otherwise controlled by innate immune responses. Observations associated with demodicosis

consisted of paw swelling, mixed cell inflammation in the interdigital skin of the paws and in the 
draining lymph nodes, and an increase in neutrophil counts.  
Haemapoietic system 
Effects consistent with JAK2 inhibition such as decreases in RBC parameters [red blood cells, 
haemoglobin, and haematocrit] and reticulocytes were observed in rats and dogs. 
In rats, reduced red blood cell parameters were observed at doses from 100 mg/kg (x97 the clinical 
exposure). In these animals, minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity was also observed. 
Decreased levels of haemoglobin and reticulocytes were observed in the 6-month study at 
administered doses of 20 and 50 mg/kg (x9 and x29 the clinical exposure). 
Decreases in RBC mass was also observed in treated dogs, with greater decreases in male animals 
than in female. 
Adrenal cortex 
Vacuolation and/or atrophy of the adrenal cortex were observed in control female dogs and female 
dogs as well as a single male dog in the 9-month study. The applicant argues that this finding is 
secondary to stress related to chronic inflammation due to the mite infection observed in the dogs. 
This explanation is considered acceptable to CHMP. 
Kidney 
Increased levels of secreted protein and blood in the urine was observed in rats administered 10 
mg/kg and above (x3 the clinical exposure). Microscopic evaluation of the kidney in the animals 
administered 100 mg/kg showed minimal to marked renal tubular epithelial 
degeneration/regeneration. In the animals exposed to upadacitinib for 6 months minimal to moderate 
tubular epithelial degeneration/regeneration was observed in the 50 mg/kg group. The observations 
were more prominent in male animals. There were no kidney related adverse observations in the dog 
studies. 
Liver 
In the rats administered 100 mg/kg that were euthanized preterm in morbid state, the microscopic 
evaluation of the liver showed moderate to marked multifocal, midzonal or diffuse necrosis in the liver. 
These animals had also an increase in alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline 
phosphatase. In the remaining animals in the study administered lower doses, no other observations 
than an increase in bilirubin and urobilinogen in the urine indicative of hepatic impact by upadacitinib 
was observed. In the 6-months study in rat in which the animals were administered 50 mg/kg/day at a 
maximum, no findings related to liver toxicity was observed except variations in the plasma protein 
levels. There were no observed findings in the dog studies. In the carcinogenicity study in Tg(HRAS) 
mice, mild periportal hepatocellular single cell necrosis was observed in female mice at approximately 
3 times the systemic exposure observed in patients. 
Gastro intestinal tract 
After 6-months of daily administration of upadacitinib in rats, in the animals in the high dose group (50 
mg/kg) the histopathological examination revealed minimal to mild erosion and ulceration or the 
mucosa primarily at the limiting ridge of the non-glandular stomach with attendant subacute/chronic 
inflammation, edema and/or epithelial hyperplasia. In the same study it was observed that there was a 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 29/201 
 
 
 
minimal to mild mucosal erosion of the tongue, and an inflammation in the submucosa extending to 
the mucosa in the mid and high dose animals (20 and 50 mg/kg/day, exposure margin x9 to what is 
observed in patients). 
No findings were observed in the studies in dogs. 
The rats were administered the test item by gavage in a solution, whereas the dogs were administered 
a capsule. It is thus possible that the tongue of the rat was directly exposed to the test item in high 
concentration. The observation of increased salivation in rats administered 50 (males only) and 100 
mg/kg supports this possibility. No study of local tolerance has been performed.  
The non-glandular stomach of rodents serves as a storage organ and is not present in humans. The 
clinical relevance of findings in the non-glandular stomach could thus be questioned although it is likely 
that the squamous mucosa lining the esophagus in species without a forestomach would react similar 
as the forestomach if the exposure would be equivalent. In the rodent, it is possible that the exposure 
time to the mucosa is prolonged due to residual upadacitinib in the forestomach. In the patients, 
upadacitinib is administered in tablets and it is therefore not likely that the mucosa of the human 
esophagus would be exposed for a prolonged time.  
Toxicokinetics 
Toxicokinetics of upadacitinib was characterized in all the pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies.  
In mice, there was no overall significant difference in plasma exposures between male and female 
mice. Plasma exposure increased more than dose proportional with an increased dose. 
In rats there was a significant difference in plasma concentrations of upadacitinib in male and female 
rats. Higher Cmax concentrations and AUC values were observed in female animals. In rats, there was 
a larger than dose proportional increase in exposure with increase in dose. This was more pronounced 
in the male animals. Also in male rats, toxic findings were more prominent, allowing higher doses of 
upadacitinib to be administered in female rats in both the carcinogenicity and fertility studies. The 
reason for this gender difference is not understood, in dogs however, there was no significant 
difference in exposure between genders. In dogs the exposures increased proportional with increased 
dose. In the dog studies, the administered doses were however lower. In the 6-month repeat dose 
toxicity study in rat, the animals tolerated exposures that were 29-52-fold the exposures found in 
patients. In the 9-month dog study, the animals were at maximum exposed to 2-fold the upadacitinib 
exposure observed in patients. 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of upadacitinib was characterized by Ames test, a chromosome aberration test 
in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and an in vivo rat bone marrow erythrocyte micronucleus test.  
The outcome of the bacterial Ames test and the micronucleus test was negative. In the in vitro 
mammalian chromosome aberration test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, upadacitinib was 
found negative for induction of structural chromosome aberrations but positive for induction of 
numerical chromosome aberration. Since no effect was observed on the structural chromosome 
breakage and the in vivo micronucleus assay was found negative, this is considered sufficient 
reassurance of lack of potential for aneuploidy induction. The exposure in the in vivo chromosomal 
aberration study was considered sufficient (up to 127 times the clinical based on Cmax, and 46 times 
on AUC for the highest dose tested). 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 30/201 
 
 
 
Based on the results of the conducted genotoxicity studies, the overall conclusion is that upadacitinib 
does not have any genotoxic potential.  
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of upadacitinib was evaluated in a 6 month study in rasH2 mice and a two 
year study in Sprague Dawley rats.  
Upadacitinib was administered to male and female SD rats (2 year study) daily by oral gavage, and 
was not carcinogenic at any dose tested. The tested doses were in male 0, 4, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg/day 
and in female 0, 3, 7.5, and 20 mg/kg/days. The maximum doses were set up based on decreased 
body weight gain, and findings in the kidney and non-glandular stomach at 50 mg/kg/day in the 26-
week repeat dose toxicity study. 
In female rats administered 20 mg/kg/day there was an increase in the lungs of alveolar histiocytosis. 
The incidence was within the historical control range and was not considered treatment related. This 
was accepted.  
No neoplasm was identified following upadacitinib treatment. The exposure multiples for the maximum 
dose tested in male and female rats relative to the 15 mg clinical dose are 4.0- and 9.9-fold, 
respectively. 
Upadacitinib was administered to male and female HRAS mice (6-month study) daily by oral gavage 
(at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day) and was not carcinogenic at any dose tested. The maximum dose was 
set up based on the results from a 4-week repeat dose toxicity study in wild type mice. The incidence 
of neoplasms in the positive control group was according to the applicant typical of this mouse model.  
No neoplasm was identified following upadacitinib treatment. The exposure multiples for the maximum 
dose tested in male and female mice relative to the 15 mg clinical dose are 2.0- and 3.4-fold, 
respectively. 
In summary, there were no test article related unscheduled deaths or differences in mortality in any of 
the studies. No neoplastic findings were identified following upadacitinib treatment. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Studies were conducted to evaluate the standard reproductive and developmental toxicity profile of 
upadacitinib: one segment I ‘fertility’ study (Sprague-Dawley rats), three pivotal segment II ‘EFD’ 
studies (Sprague-Dawley rat and New Zealand white rabbits), and one segment III ‘prenatal/postnatal 
study (Sprague Dawley rats). Additionally, one pivotal juvenile toxicity study was conducted in 
Sprague Dawley rats. 
Male and female fertility 
Male and female fertility and early embryonic development were evaluated in rats after administration 
of upadacitinib at 0, 5, 25, 50 (M)/75 (F) mg/kg/day. 
The body weight and body weight increase of the male rats was reduced in the mid and high dose 
treated animals. In the high dose animals (50 mg/kg) reduced weights of epididymides (5%) and 
prostate (13%) were observed, which correlated with the reduction in body weight. In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, no indications of toxicity to the male or female reproductive organs was observed. 
In the dose groups 0, 5, 25, and 50/75 mg/kg/day the male and female mating index was 96%, 
100%, 100%, and 92%; fertility index 84%, 92%, 84%, and 76%; and fecundity index 88%, 92%, 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 31/201 
 
 
 
84% and 83%. The fertility index was lower in the high dose group (76% vs 84% in control). The 
applicant argues that this is not upadacitinib-related since the historical control data from the lab 
ranged from 76% to 100%. In the female rats, six of 19 pregnant animals had litters comprised 
entirely of resorbed foetuses. Also in the female animals administered the mid dose, increased post-
implantation loss was observed (4.8%, 5.8%, 20.4%, and 82.6% in the 0, 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day 
dose groups). The applicant argues that these findings were attributed to the 
developmental/teratogenic effect of upadacitinib and that the reproductive and fertility parameters in 
males and females were unaffected by upadacitinib. This is accepted, although it cannot be ruled out 
that the lower fertility index observed in the high dose group is caused by upadacitinib. Furthermore it 
should be noted that in the embryo-foetal toxicity study, in which the same dose-levels were 
administered, there was no increase in the post-implantation loss or change in the litter size. Thus, 
administration of 75 mg/kg/day upadacitinib from 14 days before pairing until gestational day 7 caused 
an increase in post-implantation loss whereas administration from GD 6 to 17 did not.  
Plasma exposure of upadacitinib was not measured in the study. Instead plasma exposures from the 4 
week repeat dose study in rats were used to estimate the exposure margins to patients. Thus 
considering only the reproductive and fertility parameters the NOAEL was considered 50 mg/kg/day in 
male rats and 75 mg/kg in females. The exposure (AUC0-24, from 4-weeks study) in males at this 
dose was 16.8 µg*hr/mL. There was no corresponding dose in females, however the 50 mg/kg/day 
dose rendered an AUC of 33.2 µg*hr/mL in females. These exposures represent approximately 40 and 
80 fold the exposure observed in humans. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Two embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats. In the first study the animals were 
administered 0, 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day and since it was not possible to determine a NOAEL for the 
observed teratogenicity another study with lower doses (0, 1.5, and 4 mg/kg) was conducted. 
There were no observed treatment related effects on implantation sites, viable foetuses, resorption 
sites or litter size. The foetal body weight was slightly reduced in both male and female foetuses from 
dams administered 75 mg/kg/day upadacitinib. An increased number of skeletal malformations was 
observed in all treatment groups, percent foetuses in the 0, 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day groups were 0, 
1.4, 8, and 35. The skeletal malformations included misshapen humerus and bent scapula, bent, 
misshapen or shortened long bones of the fore- and hind limbs.  
In the second EFD study in rat with lower doses of upadacitinib, skeletal malformations were observed 
in one fetus in the 4 mg/kg group. Since these malformations were similar as the ones observed in the 
previous study, they were considered test-article-related. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 
the lowest dose, 1.5 mg/kg/day. The exposure in the dams at gestational day 16 was at this dose 115 
ng*hr/mL, which represents 0.27 of the exposure observed in humans. 
The embryo-foetal development study in rabbits was conducted at 0, 2.5, 10, and 25 mg/kg. In the 
rabbits an increase in post-implantation loss was observed (0%, 4.1%, 2.6%, 14.8% in the groups 0, 
2.5, 10, and 25 mg/kg/day). There was no apparent increase of skeletal malformations, but an 
increased incidence of cardiac malformations was observed at 25 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 
considered 10 mg/kg/day and the exposure (AUC0-24) at gestational day 18 was 881 ng*hr/mL, which 
represents approximately two-fold the exposure observed in humans. 
Prenatal and postnatal development 
The potential effects of upadacitinib on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance 
and fertility of F1 generation were evaluated in rats after administration of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10

mg/kg/day to F0 females from gestation day 6 through day 20 post-partum. In the study, only F0 
dams were administered upadacitinib. The exposure in the pups was not measured in the study. In the 
previous EFD study it was however shown that the foetuses were exposed to upadacitinib (foetal/dam 
ratio at 10 mg/kg/day was 0.003). Furthermore, in a study with radiolabelled upadacitinib it was 
shown that upadacitinib readily transferred to milk in pregnant rats (presented in the section on 
pharmacokinetics). Thus, it is likely that also the pups were exposed to upadacitinib. 
There were no treatment related effects on the F0 generation, including effects on parturition, lactation 
and maternal behaviour. There were no treatment related effects on the F1 generation in any of the 
investigated parameters, including viability, body weight, sexual maturation, behavioural testing 
(acoustic startle habituation, motor activity, and M-shaped water maze), or reproductive endpoints. 
The NOAEL for maternal systemic toxicity and F1 development was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day. 
This corresponds to an exposure margin of 2.6 fold based on AUC and compared to AUC in patients 
with 15 mg/day. 
Juvenile toxicity 
In the non-GLP dose-finding study, doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day resulted in mortality and clinical signs.  
In a main GLP study with juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats, accelerated pharmacologic effects on the 
lymphoid system and exposures similar to those observed in adult rats were evident. A TDAR assay 
within this study indicated that upadacitinib suppressed a Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH)-specific 
primary IgM and IgG antibody concentrations when administered to juvenile rats from PND 15 through 
PND 59. This effect was comparable to that of the positive control cyclophosphamide A. Dose-
dependent decrease in total T cells, T helper cells, T cytotoxic cells, B cells, NK cells and NKT cells at all 
doses was revealed by flow cytometric analysis.  
Immunotoxicity 
Upadacitinib was tested in the T-cell dependent antibody response assay (TDAR) in rats. Upadacitinib 
suppressed the anti-KLH IgN and IgG T-cell dependent antibody response. Considering the results from 
the TDAR study and the repeat-dose toxicity studies, it is clear that upadacitinib induces significant 
immune suppression. This is consistent with the mode of action and as such not unexpected. 
Impurities 
The potential manufacturing impurities for upadacitinib drug substance, including the starting 
materials, intermediates, reagents, by-products and potential side products were subjected to two 
complementary (Q)SAR analysis methodologies (Derek and CASEUltra). The impurities that showed 
structural alerts for mutagenicity and were subsequently shown to be negative in a bacterial mutation 
(Ames) testing, are not considered impurities of mutagenic concern. 
One impurity was found mutagenic in an Ames test. According to the ICH M7 guideline a maximum 
daily intake of 1.5 µg of a mutagenic can be considered acceptable for a treatment >10 years. The 
applicant has calculated the limits on a possible future maximum dose of 60 mg. The acceptable limit 
would thus be 1.5 µg/60 mg= 25 ppm. A-1653651.0/1 is controlled at 20 ppm which is acceptable. 
The bacterial reverse mutation assay was repeated several times using two different batches of 
another impurity, three times using Lot 1 and two times using Lot 2. It was concluded that Lot 1 was 
positive. No other positive results were obtained with any of the bacterial strains using standard 
criteria for a positive response.

Phototoxicity 
A neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay was performed to evaluate the phototoxic potential of 
upadacitinib. Upadacitinib did not have any phototoxic potential in the neutral red uptake bioassay. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the Phase I exposure assessment, the PECSURFACEWATER for upadacitinib 0.075 µg/L exceeded the 
action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore a Phase II Tier A assessment was triggered. 
The octanol-water partition coefficient (Log KOW) of upadacitinib was reported to be 2.5 at pH 7.4.  
Since the presented value is relatively high (2.5), the Applicant is requested to submit a determination 
of the n-octanol-buffer distribution coefficient according to OECD 107 post approval (see 
recommendations). The final conclusions regarding the screening criterion for PBT substance is thus 
pending.  
Upadacitinib is very persistent in sediment according to the OECD 308 study. 
Upadacitinib was primarily partitioned to the sediment layers. A Phase II Tier B extended effects on 
water sediment was thus triggered. 
PEC/PNEC ratios are all well below 1.

In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: The applicant should provide the final report 
describing the n-octanol-buffer distribution coefficient according to OECD 107 and updated 
environmental risk assessment for upadacitinib by 31/03/2020. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamics program of upadacitinib included in vitro cell free (biochemical) and 
cellular assays and in vivo studies in two rodent models of arthritis to determine potency and 
selectivity of upadacitinib. Specificity has been determined by evaluating upadacitinib against a panel 
of other kinases, ion channels, transporters and cell surface receptors. 
Upadacitinib was developed as an orally active and selective JAK1 inhibitor with functional inhibition of 
the JAK-STAT pathway demonstrated in several cell-based assay systems using cytokine activators 
such as IL-6 and IL-2. However, the CHMP did not agree, based on the data provided by the Applicant, 
that a JAK1 selectivity over JAK3 has been convincingly shown in either cellular assays or under ex 
vivo conditions. For example, in rat ex vivo studies, at clinically relevant plasma exposure (AUC0-24hr 
= 0,420 μg•hr/mL at 15 mg), inhibition of both JAK1 and JAK3 activity was observed since upadacitinib 
could inhibit JAK3 activity (as measured by 50% inhibition of circulating NK cells) at an AUC0-12hr of 
0.520 μg•hr/mL in rat. Moreover, in clinical ex vivo studies using in IL-6-induced pSTAT3 (as a marker 
for JAK1 activity) and IL-7-induced pSTAT5 (as a marker for JAK1/3 activity), the estimated EC50 
Assessment report

values for inhibition of IL-6-induced phosphorylation were 23.1 ng/mL (60.7 nM) and the EC50 values 
for inhibition of IL-7-induced pSTAT5 were 47.7 ng/mL (125 nM) for upadacitinib. Both these EC50 
values are well covered by the clinical Cmax of upadacitinib in human plasma following the 
recommended dosing of 15 mg ER QD. Therefore, pharmacological activity at JAK1 and JAK1/3 could 
be expected at therapeutic plasma concentrations of upadacitinib. The applicant agreed to revise the 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC accordingly. 
The applicant did not submit primary pharmacology data to demonstrate the intended pharmacological 
activity of upadacitinib in the dog and rabbit, two of the species used in the pivotal toxicology studies. 
The CHMP asked for clarifications on this point: according to published studies, there is a high 
sequence conservation of the JAK family across species and JAK inhibition of other, albeit chemical 
different, JAK inhibitors, do not apparently differ between species. In addition, the pharmacological 
profile of upadacitinib in the performed toxicity studies, including the dog and the rabbit, is indicative 
of JAK inhibition. Based on those clarifications, the CHMP agreed that there should be a minimal 
influence on upadacitinib potencies between different species and all species tested within the non-
clinical program (mouse, rat, rabbit and dog)  
The in vivo safety pharmacology studies with upadacitinib in dogs demonstrated a decrease in arterial 
blood pressure at an oral dose equal to or greater than a plasma concentration of Cmax = 0.42 µg/mL 
and an increase in heart rate at a drug plasma concentration of Cmax= 1.3 µg/ml. These effects in 
dogs were observed at plasma concentrations approximately 10 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended dose of 15 mg. A thorough QT study has not been conducted in clinical trials. However, 
an exposure-response analysis stated that no QT interval prolongation at therapeutic or supra-
therapeutic plasma exposures was observed in healthy subjects. From a non-clinical perspective, no 
further action is considered necessary with respect to safety pharmacology. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic studies with upadacitinib have been conducted in rats, beagle dogs and cynomolgus 
monkeys following oral and IV dosing. The rat and dog were chosen as the primary nonclinical species 
for upadacitinib toxicology studies based on superior exposure relative to mice and monkeys. However, 
toxicokinetic analysis was also conducted for mouse and rabbit, which were used in toxicology studies. 
Upadacitinib  does  not  have  pharmacologically  active  metabolites.  Formulation  of  upadacitinib  in  oral 
suspensions of tartrate co-crystal or free base resulted in comparable exposures in rats and dogs. 
The analytical methods were overall acceptable to the CHMP.  
Upadacitinib displays rapid absorption after a single oral dose, with Tmax in plasma ranging from 1 to 
2 h in rats, dogs and monkeys. The pharmacokinetics was further characterized by high to moderate 
plasma clearance in rat and dog, respectively, and high volume of distribution across all species. There 
was evidence of only limited decrease or accumulation (<2-fold) following multiple daily oral dosing in 
mice, rats, rabbits and dogs, which is in line with human data. 
The in vivo tissue distribution in rat showed that upadacitinib related radioactivity was distributed 
rapidly into most tissues through 4 hr post-dose, with the liver, uveal tract and adrenal gland having 
the highest exposure. Lowest exposure was found in the CNS, spinal cord and eye lens. Radioactivity 
was present in the uveal tract through 192 hours post-dose and a slower clearance in pigmented skin 
indicating an apparent affinity for melanin. Placental transfer and subsequent foetal exposure to [14C]-
upadacitinib-related radioactivity occurred at moderate to low levels. Exposure of [14C]-upadacitinib-
related radioactivity was approximately 31-fold greater in milk than in plasma. 
Plasma protein binding of upadacitinib was low in all species (fu ranged from 0.41 in rat to 0.69 in dog) 
and independent of test concentration.

Biotransformation of upadacitinib in nonclinical species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog) and human was, in 
general, low and unchanged parent was the primary drug-related component in dog (~88%) and in 
human (~79%) plasma, whereas unchanged parent represented about 56% of drug-related material in 
rats. In human plasma, the M4 metabolite was found to be a major metabolite, which was detected as 
a minor metabolite in rats and dogs. M4 is a Phase II conjugate, a normally non-reactive acyl 
glucuronide. M11 is considered an artifact resulting from degradation of M10 during sample 
preparation. Later the Applicant submitted spectroscopic data supporting the amide structure of M11. 
The mechanism for this transformation (M10 and M11) in vitro, and possibly in vivo, is unknown. M10 
is instable under mild conditions in vitro and might be a reactive intermediate in vivo. In the rat 
plasma M11 was defined as a major metabolite, which may also have indicated a high concentration of 
the preceding M10 intermediate in the rat plasma. Considering that covalent binding of reactive 
metabolites to endogenous macromolecules is one of the mechanisms that can lead to hepatoxicity, 
the applicant was asked to discuss the role of M10 intermediate in different species and its possible 
implications for liver necrosis reported in four-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. Based on the 
applicant’s response, the formation, structure and fate of intermediates M10 and M11 in metabolism 
and radiolabeled ADME studies do not support a hypothesis of a potential reactive 
intermediate/covalent binding as causality for the liver necrosis. Furthermore, liver necrosis was not 
observed in other repeat-dose rat studies of longer duration.  
The probability of chiral interconversion of upadacitinib in vivo is low, given that the observed 
metabolic pathways are consistent across species with no metabolic transformation observed in the 
chiral centres of upadacitinib in man and only low levels of the M1/M2 metabolites were detected also 
in animals. 
All human metabolites, including the major metabolite M4, were observed in one or more animal 
species. 
The species selected for the toxicology studies (rat, dog and rabbit) were shown to have similar 
elimination pathways and metabolic profiles of upadacitinib as in humans and are thus considered 
adequate for safety evaluation of upadacitinib.  
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of upadacitinib has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement with 
relevant guidelines. Also, a number of process intermediates/impurities have been studied. Overall, the 
toxicity profile of upadacitinib has been characterized via repeat dose toxicity (up to 6 months in rats 
and 9 months in dogs; no recovery period), genotoxicity, carcinogenicity studies in rats and Tg(HRAS) 
mice, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, juvenile toxicity, 
immunotoxicity, and phototoxicity studies. 
The oral route of administration was utilized in all toxicology studies to match the intended clinical 
administration route. 
In four-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats, there were decreased white blood cell counts (up to  
65% in males and -61% in females) and lymphocyte counts (up to -71% in males and females) at 10, 
50, and 100 mg/kg/day that were dose-dependent with partial recovery after four weeks. RBC 
parameters were decreased relative to control, including RBC count (to -13%), hemoglobin 
concentration (to -12%), and hematocrit (to -14%) in females at 100 mg/kg/day. 
Degeneration/regeneration of the renal tubular epithelium occurred in the 26-week repeat-dose oral 
toxicity study in rats at dose level of 50 mg/kg/day. At 50 mg/kg/day, moderate decreases in 
lymphocyte counts were observed for males and females on Week 13 (up to -70%) and at the end of 
dosing (up to -58%). In the four-week repeat-dose oral toxicity study in rats, peripheral blood 
Assessment report

Page 37/201 
 
 
 
lymphocyte immunophenotyping assay was conducted to study immunotoxicity/abnormal 
immunophenotype profiles because of upadacitinib administration. However, in the 26-week rat study 
immunophenotyping was not performed. The CHMP agreed that the four weeks dosing period was 
sufficient for recording decreases in lymphocyte subsets and immunophenotyping in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies of longer duration would not have provided any extra information. 
In the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs, cysts in on the paws and inflammatory changes in 
interdigital skin were believed to be due to alterations in immune function related to the expected 
pharmacologic activity of upadacitinib. Increased white blood cell counts ranged from 37% up to 83% 
and from 21% up to 84% in upadacitinib-treated male and female dogs, respectively. Increased 
neutrophil counts ranged from 53% to 143% and 25% to 113% for affected males and females, 
respectively. These increases in white blood cells/neutrophils were considered to result of chronic 
swelling and inflammation in the paws and not a direct effect of upadacitinib administration. The 
exposure NOAEL at 1.5 mg/kg/day (the highest dose) provided a 2.2-fold safety margin to mean 
steady state plasma exposure in RA patients receiving 15 mg upadacitinib once daily. According to 
CPMP/SWP/1042/99 Rev 1 Corr* Guideline on repeated dose toxicity, a high dose should be selected to 
enable identification of target organ toxicity or other non-specific toxicity. Ideally, at the high dose 
level, the systemic exposure to the drug and/or principal metabolites in animal model should be a 
significant multiple of the anticipated clinical systemic exposure toxicity. The sufficiency of the selected 
highest dose for long-term toxicity assessment in dogs from the clinical point of view was discussed in 
the first round of the procedure. It was agreed that an adequate demonstration of toxicity was 
achieved in the 39-week toxicity study at the highest dose. Similar, but more severe 
immunosuppression-related findings were observed in 4-week GLP dog study resulting from a more 
extensive systemic exposure. 
Absorption of upadacitinib in females was about two-fold higher compared to males in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats. Although systemic exposures of upadacitinib in the 4-week and 26-week rat 
studies were approximately two-times higher in female rats than males across the dose groups, males 
tended to have an increased sensitivity to upadacitinib-related adverse effects, including mortality in 
four-week repeat-dose toxicity study in rats.   
Due to the potent pharmacological effect of upadacitinib on lymphoid tissue and subsequent secondary 
effects, it is not unexpected that the margin of exposure for these effects is relatively low in relation to 
the therapeutic doses of upadacitinib to be used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, 
reversible changes in hematological parameters associated with JAK inhibition generally occur earlier 
and at lower doses than the kidney and/or liver effects observed in the toxicological studies. 
Upadacitinib had no effect on fertility in male or female rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in males and 
75 mg/kg/day in females in a fertility and early embryonic development study. Dose related increases 
in foetal resorptions associated with post-implantation losses at 25 and 75 mg/kg/day in this study in 
rats were attributed to the developmental/teratogenic effects of upadacitinib. Upadacitinib was 
teratogenic in both rats and rabbits. In a pre /postnatal development study in rats, there were no 
maternal effects, no effects on parturition, lactation or maternal behaviour and no effects on their 
offspring. JAK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were 
excluded from the upadacitinib clinical trials. At the CHMP’s request the Applicant agreed to add 
“pregnancy” as a contraindication for Rinvoq. SmPC sections 4.3 and 4.6 were updated accordingly. In 
addition, the SmPC recommends that women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception during treatment and for 4 weeks following the final dose of upadacitinib. The length of 
the period where contraception should be used after treatment is based on the half-life of upadacitinib, 
which is approximately 11 hours. Five half-lives is considered adequate to eliminate the drug from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 38/201 
 
 
 
body, that is approximately 3 days. The 4 week period is also based on the duration of a woman’s 
menstrual cycle.  
Adequate risk minimization measures and pharmacovigilance activities are included in the RMP to 
address the risk of foetal malformation following exposure in utero (see RMP Section). 
In rats, the milk/plasma ratio for upadacitinib was high. The milk Cmax:plasma Cmax concentration 
ratio was 19 (Tmax = 1 hr). The milk AUC0-t:plasma AUC0-t concentration ratio was 30.9. From 0.5 
through 24 hours postdose, mean milk:plasma concentration ratios ranged from 7.96 to 70.4. It was 
however not determined how much of the dose that was actually absorbed by the offspring following 
ingestion of breast milk. Upadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding; this is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
Starting materials, raw materials, intermediates and potential manufacturing impurities were subjected 
to (Q)SAR analysis for potential mutagenicity concerns. A number of identified impurities were 
evaluated in the Ames test. Most of the impurities were subject to specification limits; however, limits 
for imidazole and citric acid were justified based on toxicology data available in the literature as they 
were either not detected or not tested for in lots of upadacitinib used in nonclinical toxicology studies. 
All studies on mutagenic potential of impurities complied with GLP regulations. Upadacitinib was not 
mutagenic or genotoxic based on the results of in vitro and in vivo tests for gene mutations and 
chromosomal aberrations. 
Upadacitinib, at exposures (based on AUC) approximately 4 and 10 times the clinical dose of 15 mg in 
male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively, was not carcinogenic in a 2 year carcinogenicity 
study in Sprague-Dawley rats. Upadacitinib was not carcinogenic in a 26 week carcinogenicity study in 
CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic transgenic mice. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Upadacitinib was teratogenic in rats and rabbits 
with effects in bones in rat foetuses and in the heart in rabbit foetuses when exposed in utero. 
Upadacitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should be advised 
to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 weeks following the final dose of 
upadacitinib. 
Upadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The applicant should provide the final report describing the n-octanol-buffer distribution coefficient 
according to OECD 107 and updated environmental risk assessment for upadacitinib by 31/03/2020.

Table 4: Overview of Upadacitinib Clinical Development Program for RA – Pivotal Phase 3 Studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from 22 Phase 1 studies, 2 supportive dose ranging Phase 2 
studies, 1 supportive Phase 2b/3 dose ranging study in Japanese subjects, and 5 pivotal Phase 3 
studies. The exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships were evaluated by PKPD-modelling.

During the development, an immediate release (IR) tablet was used in several of the Phase 1 studies 
and in early Phase 2 studies. To enhance patients' compliance, a QD extended release (ER) tablet 
formulation was developed and further evaluated in Phase 3 trials in subjects with RA. To improve 
manufacturability a modified ER tablet was developed which is the planned commercial formulation. 
Upadacitinib concentrations in plasma was analysed using validated LC/MS/MS methods. 
Absorption  
Upadacitinib has a high solubility according to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS). A 
study in MDCK cells indicate that permeability may be high. Upadacitinib was a substrate for P-gp and 
BCRP in vitro. 
Following oral administration of upadacitinib prolonged-release formulation, upadacitinib is absorbed 
with a median Tmax of 2 to 4 hours . An absolute bioavailability study has not been conducted. The 
bioavailability of the ER tablet formulation was estimated to be 76% relative to the IR capsule. 
Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the proposed commercial formulation and the Phase 3 
formulation. 
The effect of food on upadacitinib bioavailability was evaluated in several studies during formulation 
development. In studies with the upadacitinib IR capsule formulation, the effect of a high-fat, high-
calorie meal resulted in no effect on AUC and a 23-30% decrease in Cmax compared to fasting 
conditions. For different ER formulations, there was a small to moderate effect of food on both AUC 
and Cmax. The effect of a high-fat meal appears to be somewhat higher for the proposed commercial 
formulation than for the Phase 3 formulation.  For the commercial formulation, upadacitinib Cmax and 
AUC increased 40% and 30% respectively, relative to the fasting conditions while Cmax and AUC 
increased by 20% and 17% respectively for the Phase 3 formulation. Upadacitinib was administered 
without regards to food in in the Phase 3 studies. 
There was no indication of dose dumping of upadacitinib ER formulation when administered with a 
high-fat meal. Furthermore, results from in vitro dissolution experiments in ethanol, indicate that no 
dose dumping is expected in vivo. 
A level A numerical IVIVC was established using the in vivo pharmacokinetic results from Study M15-
868 and in vitro dissolution data at pH 6.8 condition. 
Distribution 
Based on the popPK analysis, upadacitinib volume of distribution at steady state is estimated to be 294 
L following administration of the extended-release formulation. Plasma protein binding of upadacitinib 
was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The mean unbound fraction (fu) in human plasma was 0.48. 
Upadacitinib partitions similarly between plasma and blood cellular components, as indicated by the 
blood to plasma ratio of 1.0. 
Elimination 
Upadacitinib is eliminated both by the renal and the hepatic route. Approximately 24% and 31% of 
total upadacitinib radioactive dose were recovered as parent drug in urine and faeces, respectively, in 
a single-dose study with radiolabeled upadacitinib.  This fraction may originate either from absorbed 
and biliary secreted upadacitinib or of unabsorbed drug. Upadacitinib was a substrate of P-gp and 
BCRP in vitro. Hence, it is possible that there is either intestinal and/or biliary efflux in vivo. An 
absolute bioavailability study would have been helpful to further elucidate the absorption/elimination of 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 44/201 
 
 
 
upadacitinib. However, considering all available data, a significant part of the fraction excreted 
unchanged in faeces has likely been absorbed: 
- Upadacitinib has high solubility and possibly high permeability.  
- Results from the SAD and MAD studies do not indicate that the absorption is saturated at higher 
doses.   
- There was no effect of food on upadacitinib exposure for oral IR formulations. 
- About 60% of the parent drug was recovered in the late faecal fractions (>48 h) which likely 
originate from absorbed upadacitinib.  
Thus, if the fraction absorbed is high (i.e. close to 1), the results from the mass-balance study support 
that 24% is excreted by the renal route, and that metabolism and biliary excretion would account for 
31% each. Considering also a worst-case scenario, assuming that the unchanged fraction in faeces 
constitutes of unabsorbed upadacitinib, then the absolute bioavailability would only be 0.6. In that 
case, the fraction excreted unchanged in urine would be approximately 40% and metabolism would 
account for 60% of the total elimination. The true bioavailability is like somewhere in between 0.6 and 
1 but there are indications of a relatively high extent of absorption for IR formulations of upadacitinib. 
Renal CL was approximately 120 ml/min being higher than fu x GFR implying active secretion of 
upadacitinib. Based on in vitro data, upadacitinib is a substrate of P-gp but involvement of other renal 
transporters in the excretion of upadacitinib has not been evaluated. Based on the in vitro data, the 
CYP 3A4 enzyme is main metabolising enzyme of upadacitinib, the CYP 2D6 playing minor role.  
The pharmacologic activity of upadacitinib is attributed to the parent molecule and there are no known 
active metabolites. 
Based on the popPK analysis, upadacitinib CL/F is estimated to be 40.5 L/h for the extended release 
formulation in the RA patient population.  
Upadacitinib mean terminal elimination t1/2 ranged from 9 to 14 hours following administration of the 
extended-release formulation. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Upadacitinib Cmax and AUC were approximately dose-proportional over all evaluated single and 
multiple immediate- and extended-release dose ranges.  This encompassed a) single doses ranging 
from 1 to 48 mg using the immediate-release formulation, b) multiple BID doses ranging from 3 mg 
BID to 24 mg BID using the immediate-release formulation, c) single doses ranging from 7.5 to 45 mg 
using the extended-release formulation, and d) multiple QD doses from 15 mg to 30 mg using the 
extended-release formulation. 
Steady-state was reached after approximately four days of administration of upadacitinib ER. There 
was no significant accumulation at steady-state, with AUC accumulation ratio (Rac) close to 1. There 
were no indications of time-dependency in upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. 
Special populations 
A study in subjects with renal impairment has been performed (n=6 mild renal impairment; n=6 
moderate renal impairment; n=6 severe renal impairment; n=6 normal renal function). Upadacitinib 
exposure (AUCinf) were 18%, 33% and 44% higher in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function.

In a study with subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh [CP]-A, N = 6), moderate hepatic 
impairment (CP-B, N = 6), and with normal hepatic function (N = 6), upadacitinib AUC was 28% and 
24% higher in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Upadacitinib was not studied in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
The covariates gender, race, body weight, and age (≥18 years of age) are not expected to have a 
clinically relevant effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Upadacitinib as a victim drug 
In vitro, upadacitinib was a substrate for CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-pg and BCRP. Upadacitinib was not a 
substrate for CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2J2, FMO1, FMO3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 or OCT1 in 
vitro. 
In vivo, the effect of the strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole, 400 mg QD, on upadacitinib 
administered as the IR formulation was weak to moderate; upadacitinib AUC and Cmax increased 1.8- 
Assessment report

and 1.7-fold respectively, compared to administration of upadacitinib alone. Following multiple doses of 
rifampicin, a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, 600 mg QD for 8 days, upadacitinib AUC and Cmax decreased 
by 60% and 50% respectively. 
Given the comparability of upadacitinib CL/F between subjects with extensive and poor metabolizer 
phenotypes for CYP2D6, concomitant medications that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 are expected to 
have no effect on upadacitinib plasma exposures. 
There is no expected effect of pH modifying medications on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. 
There was no effect on upadacitinib exposure following co-administration with methotrexate.  
Upadacitinib as a perpetrator drug 
There was no in vivo relevant inhibition by upadacitinib on any of the enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) or transporters evaluated in vitro (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATB1B3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, MATE2K). Upadacitinib was an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in 
vitro while the results for CYP1A2 were borderline with only a minor concentration dependence. 
The effect of repeated doses of 30 mg upadacitinib on the pharmacokinetics of specific substrates of 
different CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, 3A, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19) was evaluated in an in vivo cocktail study. 
The exposure of oral midazolam was decreased by 26%, indicating that upadacitinib is a weak inducer 
of CYP3A4. There was no relevant effect on the plasma exposure of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9 and 2C19. In a 
study with bupropion, there was no relevant effect on bupropion AUC or Cmax and hence, no indication 
of upadacitinib being an inducer of CYP2B6 in vivo.   
Upadacitinib 30 mg QD decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 33% and atorvastatin AUC by 23% while its 
metabolite ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin AUC remained unchanged. 
The effect of multiple doses of upadacitinib ER 30 mg did not change the exposure of ethinylestradiol 
and levonorgestrel.  
Population pharmacokinetics 
A population approach was used to characterize the PK of upadacitinib in target population and healthy 
subjects, characterize the between-patient variability, assess intrinsic and extrinsic factors that could 
significantly influence upadacitinib, and estimate individual patient exposure for exposure-response 
analyses. The population analyses were performed in two steps, first based on phase 1-2 data in 
support of dose selection for phase 3. Upon the availability of the phase 3 data, the population PK 
model was reassessed with phase 1-3 data. 
A two-compartment model with first-order absorption for the immediate-release formulation, mixed 
zero and first order absorption with lag time for the extended-release formulation, and linear 
elimination adequately described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Statistically significant covariates 
were patient population (RA versus healthy), creatinine clearance, and baseline bodyweight on CL/F; 
and body weight on Vc/F. For a typical RA patient and reference body weight of 74 kg and CrCL of 109 
mL/min, upadacitinib CL/F is estimated to be 40.5 L/h and the volume of distribution at steady state is 
estimated to be 294 L following administration of the extended-release formulation.  The inter-subject 
variability for upadacitinib CL/F and Vc/F were estimated to be 21%, 24%, respectively, in the Phase 1 
studies, and 37% and 53%, respectively, in the Phase 2/3 studies.  The oral bioavailability of the 
extended-release formulation relative to immediate-release formulation was estimated to be 76%.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Janus Kinases (JAKs) are intracellular enzymes that transmit cytokine or growth factor signals involved 
in a broad range of cellular processes including inflammatory responses, haematopoiesis and immune 
surveillance.  The JAK family of enzymes contains four members, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 which 
work in pairs to phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). 
This phosphorylation, in turn, modulates gene expression and cellular function. 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. In healthy volunteers, the administration of upadacitinib (immediate 
release formulation) resulted in a dose-, and concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-6 (JAK1/JAK2) - 
induced STAT3 and IL-7 (JAK1/JAK3)-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in whole blood. The maximal 
inhibition was observed 1 hour after dosing which returned to near baseline by the end of dosing 
interval. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Upadacitinib doses evaluated in the two Phase 2 dose-ranging studies were selected based on 
exposure-response analyses for the effects of upadacitinib on interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-7 signalling 
pathways evaluated in ex-vivo assays compared to tofacitinib 5 mg BID in early Phase 1 studies. The 
applicant carried out exposure response analysis from Phase 2 studies and Phase 3 studies that 
supported the selection of 15 mg QD for the sought RA indication. 
Exposure-QT  
To evaluate the risk of the QT interval prolongation and pro-arrhythmic potential of upadacitinib, a 
linear mixed-effects exposure-response analysis was conducted.  The effect of food on the QT interval 
corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) in subjects who received placebo under non-
fasting conditions in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) study versus those who received placebo 
under fasting conditions in the upadacitinib single ascending dose study was used to evaluate ECG 
assay sensitivity.  Bias analysis which explored the relationship between the means and differences of 
the semi-automated and fully-automated QT measurements was conducted to ensure lack of bias in 
the QT intervals corrected by the over-reader and protect against false negatives. The analyses 
Assessment report

Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 48/201 
 
 
 
 
demonstrated that there was no relationship between upadacitinib plasma concentrations and QT 
interval prolongation at therapeutic or supra-therapeutic plasma exposures. 
Exposure-efficacy 
Exposure-response analyses characterized the relationships between upadacitinib exposures and 
efficacy (assessed as the percentage of subjects achieving ACR20/50/70) using data from the two 
dose-ranging Phase 2 studies and supported, along with the analyses of safety, the selection of doses 
for Phase 3.  The results of the analyses indicated that upadacitinib plasma exposures associated with 
6 mg BID to 12 mg BID using the immediate-release formulation were predicted to maximize efficacy 
in patients with moderate to severely active RA who are on background treatment of MTX.  
Upadacitinib doses of 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD using the ER formulation were predicted to have 
similar efficacy to 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID using the immediate-release formulation.  Upadacitinib 
dose of 3 mg BID using the immediate-release formulation (7.5 mg using the ER formulation) was 
predicted to provide sub-optimal efficacy compared to higher doses, especially in the more refractory 
anti-TNF-IR population. 
Based on exposure-response analyses of efficacy and effects on laboratory parameters in Phase 2 
studies, upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses using the ER formulation were predicted to provide 
the optimal balance of benefit-risk in subjects with moderately to severely active RA and were selected 
to be evaluated in Phase 3. 
Exposure-response analyses based on both phase 2 and phase 3 data, demonstrated that plasma 
exposures associated with upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose maximize upadacitinib efficacy and the 30 mg 
QD dose provides only a small incremental benefit in subjects with RA (≤ 5% increase in ACR20, 
ACR50, ACR70, LDA based on disease activity score 28 joint count based on C-reactive protein [DAS28 
(CRP)] or CR based on DAS28 (CRP) from 15 mg QD to 30 mg QD).   
Exposure-safety 
The relationship between upadacitinib Cavg and the probability of experiencing specific changes in 
hemoglobin, natural killer (NK) cells, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and neutrophils at Week 12 in Phase 
2b studies (Studies M13-537 and M13-550) were characterized.  The analyses demonstrated that 
upadacitinib doses higher than 12 mg BID using the immediate-release formulation (30 mg QD using 
the ER formulation) were predicted to result in greater effects on hemoglobin, NK cells and CPK 
compared to 12 mg BID.  Decreases in hemoglobin were observed mostly at exposures associated with 
doses of ≥ 12 mg BID immediate-release (30 mg QD ER formulation) or higher.   
Exposure-response relationships were evaluated for the different safety measures using a pooled 
dataset across Phase 2 and 3 studies.  No trends for exposure-response relationships were observed 
for pneumonia, herpes zoster infection, changes in platelet count (platelets ≥ 600 × 109/L with 
baseline ≤ 400 × 109/L, platelets > 400 × 109/L with baseline ≤ 400 × 109/L), lymphopenia (Grade 4 
or higher), and neutropenia (Grade 3 or higher) at Week 12/14 or Week 24/26. 
Increased upadacitinib exposures were statistically associated with higher incidence of hemoglobin 
decrease from baseline (> 1 g/dL and > 2 g/dL) at Week 12/14 and at Week 24/26; decreases in 
hemoglobin were observed mostly at exposures associated with 30 mg QD or higher.  Upadacitinib 
exposures were associated with higher incidence of lymphopenia Grade 3 or higher at Week 12/14, but 
was not statistically significant at Week 24/26.  Upadacitinib exposures were associated with slight 
increase in the incidence of serious infections at Week 24/26, but not at Week 12/14.  Upadacitinib 
plasma AUC was comparable between subjects who experienced venous thromboembolic event or

term safety data across the Phase 3 studies.   
Based on the established exposure-safety relationships, scenarios for increases in exposures by 25% 
to 75% were simulated which cover the effects of all evaluated intrinsic and extrinsic factors. A 
summary of the simulated effects is in the table below.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical method was in general well validated.  
Absorption 
Overall the clinical pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib in healthy subjects has been extensively 
evaluated. There are uncertainties in the bioavailability and absorption of upadacitinib because the 
absolute bioavailability has not been studied. However, this was considered acceptable to CHMP. 
Following oral administration of upadacitinib prolonged-release formulation, upadacitinib is absorbed 
with a median Tmax of 2 to 4 hours.  
The 25-30% lower bioavailability of the extended-release tablet relative to immediate-release 
formulations may be the result of lower permeability of upadacitinib in the distal part of the 
intestine/colon. The effect of a high-fat meal appears to be somewhat higher for the proposed 
commercial formulation than for the Phase 3 formulation.  For the commercial formulation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 50/201 
 
 
 
 
upadacitinib Cmax and AUC increased 39% and 29% respectively, relative to the fasting conditions 
while Cmax and AUC increased by 20% and 17% respectively for the Phase 3 formulation. The food-
effect is not considered to be clinically relevant and the CHMP agreed that upadacitinib may be 
administered with or without food. In clinical trials, upadacitinib was administered without regard to 
meals. 
In vitro, upadacitinib is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and BCRP. 
Distribution 
Upadacitinib has a relatively large volume of distribution. Plasma protein binding is moderate (52%). 
Elimination 
Following single dose administration of [14C]-upadacitinib immediate-release solution, upadacitinib 
was eliminated predominantly as the unchanged parent substance in urine (24%) and faeces (31%).  
Renal CL indicates some involvement of renal transporters in the excretion. Renal secretion is however 
not estimated to contribute to more than 25% of the elimination.   
In vitro, upadacitinib was mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6. 
Involvement of CYP3A4 was confirmed in an in vivo interaction study with ketoconazole where a 1.75-
fold increase in upadacitinib exposure was observed. The contribution of CYP2D6 is expected to be 
minor given the comparability of upadacitinib CL/F in extensive and poor metabolisers in the Phase 1 
and Phase 2 population (popPK analysis). 
Approximately 34% of upadacitinib dose was excreted as metabolites.  
Upadacitinib mean terminal elimination half-life ranged from 9 to 14 hours. 
Special populations 
The effect of different intrinsic factors has been evaluated in dedicated PK studies in renal and hepatic 
impairment and in Asian subjects, and by population pharmacokinetic analysis from the phase 2/3 
studies.  
Upadacitinib AUC was 18%, 33% and 44% higher in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal 
impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. This is consistent with an 
approximately 25% contribution of the renal route to upadacitinib elimination. Based on the exposure-
response analyses, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. However, as 
stated in the SmPC, upadacitinib should be used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. 
The use of upadacitinib has not been studied in subjects with end stage renal disease. 
The effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics was modest. 
AUC increased by 28 and 24% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment respectively 
compared to normal subjects. No dose adjustment is proposed in these patients. Data for severe 
hepatic impairment is missing. Based on clinical considerations, upadacitinib is contraindicated in 
severe hepatic impairment patients.  
The population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no relevant effects of gender, race, age or weight 
on upadacitinib pharmacokinetic parameters. As stated in the SmPC, there are limited data in patients 
aged 75 years and older and there is no pharmacokinetic data in children and adolescents.

Interactions 
The drug interaction potential with methotrexate has been addressed adequately and no clinically 
significant drug interaction was observed.  
Upadacitinib as victim drug 
Based on the elimination mechanisms (CYP3A4 metabolism, transport via Pgp and BCRP), the relevant 
in vivo interaction studies have been performed, i.e. with ketoconazole (CYP3A4/Pgp inhibitor) and 
rifampicin (PXR inducer).  A study with a BCRP inhibitor was not performed, but this is acceptable as, 
at present, there are few or no specific BCRP inhibitors used clinically. 
The strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor ketoconazole increased upadacitinib AUC and Cmax 1.75 and 1.7-
fold. There was no effect on half-life indicating an effect mainly on pre-systemic metabolism or P-gp. 
Multiple doses of rifampicin, a strong PXR inducer, decreased upadacitinib AUC by 60%. An appropriate 
wording for concomitant administration with 3A4 inhibitors and inducers is included in the SmPC. The 
effect of moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors on upadacitinib exposure is not expected to be clinically 
relevant. 
Upadacitinib as a perpetrator drug: 
The potential of upadacitinib to act as perpetrator in drug-drug interactions was thoroughly 
investigated in vitro in accordance with the EMA interaction guideline. There was no in vivo relevant 
inhibition by upadacitinib on any of the enzymes (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) or 
transporters evaluated in vitro (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATP1B1, OATB1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
MATE1, MATE2K). Upadacitinib was identified as an inducer of CYP3A4 (PXR) and CYP2B6 (CAR) in 
vitro, while the results for CYP1A2 (Ah-receptor) were borderline with only a minor concentration 
dependence. 
In vivo, the exposure of oral midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, was decreased by 26%, 
indicating that upadacitinib (30 mg dose) is a weak inducer of the PXR-mediated metabolism by 
CYP3A4. The effect is expected to be lower with the clinical dose 15 mg. There was no inducing effect 
of upadacitinib on ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel following multiple-doses of upadacitinib ER 30 mg. 
There was no relevant effect on the plasma exposure of other PXR regulated enzymes (CYP2C9 and 
2C19) or enzymes regulated by the Ah-receptor (CYP1A2). In a study with bupropion, there was no 
relevant effect on bupropion AUC or Cmax and hence, no indication of upadacitinib being an inducer of 
CAR (CYP2B6). 
Upadacitinib 30 mg QD decreased rosuvastatin AUC by 33% and atorvastatin AUC by 23% while its 
metabolite ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin AUC remained unchanged. 
Population PK 
Standard population analysis methodology for model development and evaluation has been used. 
Parameter uncertainty values, goodness-of-fit plots, and visual predictive checks all indicate that the 
final PopPK model provides an adequate description of upadacitinib PK.  
Shrinkage for empirical Bayes estimates of CL and V2 in RA patients are 19% and 50%, respectively. 
These values indicate that predicted individual average concentrations are considered adequate for 
exposure-response analyses, since CL is the most influential parameter for average concentration. The 
CHMP noted that predicted individual Cmax concentrations are expected to be shrunk towards the 
population mean; hence, exposure-response model results using Cmax as the exposure metric should 
be interpreted with some caution.

Pharmacodynamics 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2. 
Exposure-QTc 
Data from MAD and SAD studies with an exposure range well exceeding therapeutic exposure rage 
were used for the exposure-QTc analysis. Furthermore, the concentration and the ECG measurements 
were time-matched. Overall, the data used for the exposure-QTc analysis is considered adequate. 
The analysis methodology follows the ICH E14 Q&A and is considered acceptable. The upper bound of 
the 2-sided 90% confidence interval of the predicted ΔΔQTcF was below 3.33 msec for the highest 
exposure level (442 ng/mL) which is well below the upper cut-off of 10 msec. Subsequently it is 
concluded that upadacitinib has no clinically relevant effect on the QT interval. 
Exposure-efficacy  
The exposure-efficacy analyses for both ACR and LDA/CR response variables display that the efficacy 
of upadacitinib is (dose)-exposure-dependent. 
The applicant carried out exposure response analysis from Phase 2 studies and Phase 3 studies that 
supported the selection of 15 mg QD for the sought RA indication. 
Exposure-safety 
Logistic regression models were used to describe the effect of upadacitinib on safety endpoints at week 
12/14 and week 24/26. Separate models have been developed for week 12/14 and 24/26 data and 
consequently no time-effect has been evaluated. However, standard logistic regression models have 
been developed and evaluated, and the model-based analysis methodology is considered adequate. 
Furthermore, the exposure-safety models are considered appropriate to use to support the dose 
justification for upadacitinib.  
Exposure-dependent changes were observed for decreases in hemoglobin and Grade 3 or higher 
lymphopenia, as well as for severe infection. As reflected in the SmPC, treatment should not be 
initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) that is < 500 cells/mm3, an absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) that is < 1,000 cells/mm3 or who have haemoglobin (Hb) levels that are < 8 
g/dL In addition, treatment should be interrupted if a patient develops a serious infection until the 
infection is controlled. 
The analyses demonstrated that there was no relationship between upadacitinib plasma concentrations 
and QT interval prolongation at therapeutic or supra therapeutic plasma exposures. 
Graphical analysis for exposure versus MACE and VTE events have been provided. No trend with 
increasing exposure and MACE or VTE event could be detected. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Upadacitinib is a selective and reversible JAK inhibitor. In human cellular assays, upadacitinib 
preferentially inhibits signalling by JAK1 or JAK1/3 with functional selectivity over cytokine receptors 
that signal via pairs of JAK2.  
The pharmacokinetics and the interaction potential of upadacitinib have been thoroughly investigated.

Population PK analyses are in general well described. The exposure-response analyses describe the 
relationship between upadacitinib plasma concentrations and efficacy and safety sufficiently well to 
support the recommended upadacitinib dose of 15mg once daily.   
Treatment with upadacitinib should not be initiated in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC) that is < 500 cells/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) that is < 1,000 cells/mm3 or who 
have haemoglobin (Hb) levels that are < 8 g/dL In addition, treatment should be interrupted if a 
patient develops a serious infection until the infection is controlled. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Considering the indication sought by the applicant, study M13-545 (1st line) could be considered 
supportive rather than pivotal. However, it does include important data for the sought indication; 
hence, it will be described among the pivotal studies.

Treatments 
The study is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes Period 1 (48 weeks) and Period 2 (up to 4 
years) and a Japan sub-study, see figure below for treatment groups and overall design. An unblinded 
analysis was conducted when all subjects had completed Week 24 or otherwise prematurely 
discontinued. Subjects and sites remained blinded until after all subjects had completed Period 1. The 
interim week 24 report (CSR) for this study was included in the current submission.  
Rescue therapy was defined for Weeks 12 through 24, Week 26, and Weeks 36 through 40.  Rescue 
therapy for those subjects who meet the following criteria from Week 12 through Week 24 are as 
follows: Those who do not achieve ≥ 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared with baseline at 
two consecutive visits starting at Week 12 will continue on their blinded therapy and the Investigator 
should optimize background RA medications (NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or low-potency analgesics).  
Subjects who meet the joint count rescue criteria at Week 16 or 20 were treated as non-responders at 
Week 24 for the primary analysis. Rescue possibilities at week 26, for patients that did not achieve CR

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving CR (Clinical Remission) defined by 
Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) C-reactive protein (CRP) < 2.6, at Week 24. 
Ranked key secondary endpoints at Week 24 were: 1) change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP); 2) 
change from baseline in HAQ-DI; 3) ACR50 response rate; 4) change from baseline in modified Total 
Sharp Score (mTSS); 5) proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2; 6) change 
from baseline in SF-36 PCS; 7) proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression (defined as 
change from baseline in mTSS ≤ 0) at Weeks 24. 
Sample size, Randomisation, Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment Groups 2, 3, and 4 below, except for subjects 
from Japan, who were randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Group 1: Upadacitinib 7.5 mg QD monotherapy (subjects in Japan only; N = 75) 
Group 2: Upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300; includes 37 subjects from Japan) 
Group 3: Upadacitinib 30 mg QD monotherapy (N = 300; includes 37 subjects from Japan) 
Group 4: MTX monotherapy (N = 300; includes 37 subjects from Japan) 
Randomization was stratified by geographic region.

Each subject was to be instructed to take 2 capsules once weekly (MTX and/or matching placebo) and 
1 tablet QD (upadacitinib or matching placebo) to maintain blinding. 
Study drug assignment remained blinded to sites and subjects until the last subject had completed 
Period 1 (Week 48); thereafter, open-label study drug was provided. The sponsor was unblinded after 
the Week 24 database lock. The blind was broken for the primary efficacy analysis when all subjects 
had completed the Week 24 visit. 
Statistical methods  
A global analysis was conducted for the comparisons of upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD 
treatment groups versus the MTX treatment group for all subjects (excluding the Japan specific 
upadacitinib 7.5 mg treatment group).  
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized. Supportive analysis was also conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. For the analysis 
of DAS28 CR response rate, ACR20 and ACR50, the comparisons were made between each 
upadacitinib dose and the MTX group using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for geographic 
region. Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) was used as the primary analysis. Point estimate, 95% CI 
and p-value for the treatment comparison were presented. Both nominal p-value constructed using the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and adjusted p-value through the graphical multiplicity procedure are 
provided. Subjects who meet the joint count rescue criteria at Week 16 or 20 will be treated as non-
responders at Week 24 for the primary analysis. 
The overall significance level was maintained over the primary endpoint and ranked key secondary 
endpoints with the graphical procedure defined in the figure below.

Figure 3 Graphical multiple testing procedure 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed in demographic subgroups including age, gender, 
weight, body mass index, race, and geographical region to assess the consistency of the treatment 
effect. Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease characteristics and stratification factors 
were also conducted. 
Analysis Sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The FAS was used for all efficacy and baseline analyses. 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represented a subset of the FAS and consisted of all FAS subjects who 
did not meet any major protocol deviations through Week 24 of the study.  
The Safety Analysis Set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects were assigned to a treatment group based on the "as treated" treatment 
group, regardless of the treatment randomized. The "as treated" was determined by the treatment the 
subject received during the majority of the subject's drug exposure time in the analysis period. All 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug received the treatment to which they were 
randomized and therefore, the Safety Analysis Set was the same as the FAS.

For all analysis sets, global analyses were performed on the treatment groups of upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, and MTX and included all subjects enrolled under these three treatment 
groups. 
Sensitivity Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The analysis of ACR20 and ACR50 at Week 12 were repeated using Observed Cases and the analysis of 
CR at Week 24 were repeated using As Observed as a sensitivity analysis without any imputation.  
Supportive NRI analysis for ACR20, ACR50 and CR and supportive linear extrapolation and AO analysis 
for change from baseline in mTSS were also conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. 
Tipping point analyses were conducted for the following endpoints as a sensitivity check to assess the 
impact of potential departures from the missing-at-random assumption: change from baseline in 
DAS28 (CRP), HAQ-DI, and SF-36 PCS at Week 12, ACR50 response rate at Week 12, and change from 
baseline in mTSS at Week 24. This analysis is classified as a post hoc analysis.

csDMARD therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 
sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug 
•  Subjects must have failed at least one of the following: MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. 
Subjects with inadequate response to hydroxychloroquine and/or chloroquine were to only be 
included if they also failed MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. 
Exclusion criteria (summary of most notable) 
• 
Prior exposure to any Janus kinase inhibitor (including but not limited to tofacitinib, baricitinib, 
and filgotinib) 
•  Considered inadequate responders to biological DMARD (bDMARD) therapy (subjects with prior 
exposure to at most one bDMARD were eligible to be enrolled in the study-up to 20% of total 
number of subjects-if they had either exposure<3 months or had to discontinue due to 
intolerability). 
There were also exclusion criteria relating to abnormal laboratory values etc. 
Treatments and overall design 
This was a Phase 3 multi-center study that included Period 1 (12 weeks) and Period 2 (up to 5 years), 
see figure below for treatment groups and overall design. An unblinded analysis was to be conducted 
after all subjects had completed Period 1 (Week 12). Study sites and subjects were to remain blinded 
for the duration of the study (i.e. during Period 2). The submitted CSR covers Period 1. 
At week 24, subjects that did not achieve LDA could adjust background RA medication as rescue. No 
rescue possibilities were reported for Period 1.

Figure 4 Study Design Study M13-549 (Select Next) 
The primary endpoint is LDA (Low Disease Activity) based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12. 
Ranked key secondary endpoints (at Week 12): 1) change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP); 2) change 
from baseline in HAQ-DI; 3) ACR20 response rate; 4) change from baseline in SF-36 PCS; 5) 
proportion of subjects achieving CR based on DAS28 (CRP); 6) proportion of subjects achieving LDA 
based on CDAI ≤ 10; 7) change from baseline in morning stiffness (duration); and 8) change from 
baseline in FACIT-F. 
Other key secondary endpoints (at Week 12, if not specified) included: 1) ACR 50% response (ACR50) 
rate; 2) ACR 70% response (ACR70) rate; 3) proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response rate at 
Week 1. 
Randomisation  
Randomization was stratified by prior exposure to bDMARD (yes/no) and geographic region. Subjects 
who met eligibility criteria were to be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment groups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Group 1: upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2) 
Group 2: upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 200) (Period 1) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) 
Group 3: Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Period 2) 
Group 4: Placebo (N = 100) (Period 1) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Period 2) 
Blinding 
Each subject was instructed to take 1 tablet QD with the randomised treatment.  The tablets were 
identical in appearance for all treatments to maintain blinding. 
Study drug assignment remained blinded to subject, sites, and sponsor until the last subject had 
completed Period 1 (week 12), when an unblinded analysis was conducted by the sponsor. Subjects

and study sites remained blinded for the duration of the single-blinded 5-year (long-term) extension 
period. 
Statistical Methods 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized. Supportive analysis was also conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. 
The null hypotheses stated that the efficacy of upadacitinib 30mg once daily (QD) and upadacitinib 15 
mg QD versus the combined placebo groups for the treatment of signs and symptoms as measured by 
the primary endpoint (EMA) “LDA as measured by Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 (CRP) at Week 12” 
and multiple ranked binary and continuous secondary endpoints is equal. 
Binary endpoints were compared between groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for 
the stratification factor “prior bDMARD use”. The point estimate, the 95% confidence interval using 
normal approximation and the p-value for the treatment comparison was presented. Missing values 
were imputed by non-responder imputation (NRI) (incl. the primary endpoint). In addition, exploratory 
tipping point efficacy analyses, including the primary endpoint (DAS28[CRP] at week 12), were 
performed. The overall significance level was maintained over the primary endpoint and key secondary 
endpoints with the graphical procedure defined in the figure below. 
Figure 5 Graphical multiple testing procedure 
Major continuous endpoints (DAS28, HAQ-DI) were compared between groups based on their change 
from baseline using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model included endpoint at 
baseline, stratification factor “prior DMARD use”, and the treatment as fixed factors. Missing values 
were imputed by multiple imputation (MI). 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 68/201 
 
 
 
 
 
Other continuous endpoints were compared between groups using a Mixed Model with Repeated 
Measurements (MMRM) with the stratification factor “prior bDMARD use”, endpoint at baseline, visit, 
treatment, and visit x treatment interaction as fixed effect variables. An unstructured variance-
covariance matrix was used. The parameter estimations used the method of Restricted Maximum 
Likelihood (REML) and were based on the assumption of data being missing-at-random. 
For continuous endpoints, the LS mean and 95% confidence interval was reported for each randomized 
treatment group; the LS mean treatment difference and associated 95% confidence interval was 
reported comparing each upadacitinib dose group with the combined placebo group. The nominal p-
value was adjusted using a graph-based multiple testing procedure.  
The primary efficacy analyses were performed in demographic subgroups including age, sex, weight, 
BMI, race, geographic region, duration of RA diagnosis, baseline RF status, baseline anti-CCP antibody 
status, baseline both RF positive and anti-CCP positive, baseline both RF negative and anti-CCP 
negative, baseline DAS28 (CRP), and prior bDMARD use. 
Safety analysis were performed in the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety endpoints consisted of AE 
monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical 
laboratory testing (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for 
the entire study duration. 
Analysis sets 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The FAS was used for all efficacy and baseline analyses. 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represented a subset of the FAS and consisted of all FAS subjects who 
did not meet any major protocol deviations during Period 1 of the study. 
The Safety Analysis Set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects were assigned to a treatment group based on the "as treated" treatment 
group, regardless of the treatment randomized. The "as treated" was determined by the treatment the 
subject received during the majority of the subject's drug exposure time in the analysis period. All 
subjects received the treatment they were randomized to in Period 1 and therefore, the Safety Analysis 
Set was the same as the FAS for Period 1. 
Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variables 
The primary analysis for point estimate and CI was repeated using Observed Cases without any 
imputation as a sensitivity analysis. This was conducted on the FAS based on randomized treatment 
groups. Supportive NRI analysis was conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set.

There were also exclusion criteria relating to abnormal laboratory values etc. 
Treatments and overall design 
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that included Period 1 (48 weeks) and Period 2 (up to 5 years), see 
figure below for treatment groups and overall design. An unblinded analysis was conducted after all 
subjects had completed their Week 26 visit or otherwise had prematurely discontinued. Subjects and 
sites were to remain blinded until after all subjects have completed Period 1 (and Period 1 database 
lock was complete). The interim week 26 report, CSR, was included in the current submission. The cut-
off date for the CSR was 02 February 2018. 
Starting at the Week 26 visit (after Week 26 assessments were performed) and thereafter, initiation of 
or change in background RA medication was allowed as per local label. Starting at Week 48 (and 
thereafter, initiation of or change in conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs) was allowed as per local label. 
Rescue therapy was to be offered to subjects who met the following criteria: 
a) Placebo: 
Subjects who did not achieve a ≥ 20% improvement in tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count 
(SJC) at Weeks 14, 18, or 22 compared to Baseline were to be switched to blinded upadacitinib 
treatment. 
At Week 26, all remaining subjects were switched to blinded upadacitinib treatment regardless of 
clinical response. 
b) Adalimumab: 
Subjects who did not achieve a ≥ 20% improvement in TJC and SJC at Weeks 14, 18, or 22 compared 
to Baseline were to be switched to blinded upadacitinib treatment. 
At Week 26, all remaining subjects who did not achieve low disease activity (LDA) according to Clinical 
Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 10) at Week 26 were to be switched to blinded 
upadacitinib treatment. 
c) Upadacitinib: 
Subjects who did not achieve a ≥ 20% improvement in TJC and SJC at Weeks 14, 18, or 22 compared 
to Baseline were to be switched to blinded adalimumab treatment. 
At Week 26, all remaining subjects who did not achieve LDA according to CDAI (LDA defined as CDAI ≤ 
10) at Week 26 were to be switched to blinded adalimumab treatment.

Outcomes/Endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving CR (based on DAS28 CRP < 2.6) at Week 
12. 
Ranked key secondary endpoints (upadacitinib versus placebo if not otherwise specified) were: 1) 
change from Baseline in mTSS at Week 26; 2) proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28 
(CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12; 3) change from Baseline in DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12; 4) change from 
Baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12; 5) ACR20 response rate at Week 12; 6) proportion of subjects 
achieving LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (non-inferiority of upadacitinib versus 
adalimumab); 7) change from Baseline in SF-36 PCS at Week 12; 8) proportion of subjects achieving 
LDA based on CDAI at Week 12; 9) change from Baseline in morning stiffness (duration) at Week 12; 
10) change from Baseline in FACIT-F at Week 12; and 11) proportion of subjects with no radiographic 
progression (defined as change from Baseline in mTSS ≤ 0) at Week 26. 
Other key secondary endpoints (upadacitinib versus placebo) were: 1) ACR50 response rate at Week 
12; and 2) ACR70 response rate at Week 12. 
Randomisation  
Subjects who met eligibility criteria were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of three treatment groups: 
•  Group 1: upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 600) 
•  Group 2: placebo (N = 600) 
•  Group 3: adalimumab (40 mg every other week [eow]) (N = 300) 
Randomization is stratified by prior exposure to bDMARD (yes/no) and geographic region.

Blinding 
To maintain the study blind, subjects received both oral study drug QD (either upadacitinib 15 mg or 
matching placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either adalimumab 40 mg or matching placebo) 
until the study is unblinded. 
An unblinded analysis was conducted when all subjects had completed their Week 26 visit. To maintain 
integrity of the trial and avoid introduction of bias, study sites and subjects remained blinded for the 
duration of Period 1.  
The long-term extension period is blinded until the last subject completes Period 1. When the last 
subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 48), study drug assignment in both periods will be 
unblinded to the Sponsor and sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion 
until the completion of Period 2. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. The FAS will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses. 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represents a subset of the FAS and consists of all FAS subjects who did 
not meet any major protocol violations during the study. Definitions of major protocol violations will be 
detailed in the SAP. Additional analysis may be conducted on the Per Protocol analysis set, in order to 
evaluate the impact of major protocol violations. 
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually 
received, regardless of the treatment randomized. 
Statistical tests are at two-sided significance level of 0.05 for efficacy analyses and all other analyses. 
A test will be deemed significant if the P value is less than or equal to 0.05 unless otherwise specified. 
Analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted on the FAS based on treatment as randomized. For 
the ACR20 and CR comparison between the upadacitinib group and the placebo group, Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors was used. For the primary analysis of 
ACR20 and CR response at Week 12, Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) was used. In addition, 
sensitivity analysis was done using Observed Cases. Supportive analysis was conducted on the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set. 
To preserve Type I error, a step-down approach was used to test the primary and ranked key 
secondary endpoints where statistical significance can be claimed for a lower ranked endpoint only if 
the previous endpoints in the sequence meet the requirements of significance. 
Interim Analysis 
An unblinded analysis was conducted after all subjects had completed Week 26. To maintain integrity 
of the trial and avoid introduction of bias, study sites and subjects were remain blinded for the 
duration of Period 1. Additional unblinded analyses were conducted after the Week 26 unblinded 
analysis. 
Tipping point analyses were conducted for the following endpoints as a sensitivity check to assess the 
impact of potential departures from the missing-at-random assumption: change from Baseline in 
DAS28 (CRP) and HAQ-DI at Week 12, ACR20 response rate at Week 12, and change from Baseline in 
mTSS at Week 26. These were defined after finalization of the SAP.

identical in appearance for all treatments to maintain blinding. 
Study drug assignment remained blinded to subjects, sites and the sponsor until the last subject had 
completed Period 1 (week 14), when an unblinded analysis was conducted by the sponsor. Subjects 
and study sites remained blinded for the duration of the single-blinded 226-week (long-term) 
extension study. 
Statistical Methods 
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized. Supportive analysis was also conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. 
The null hypotheses stated that the efficacy of upadacitinib 30mg once daily (QD) alone and 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD alone versus continuing MTX alone for the treatment of signs and symptoms as 
measured by the primary endpoint (EMA) “LDA as measured by Disease Activity Score 28 [DAS28] C-
reactive protein [CRP] ≤ 3.2) at week14” and multiple ranked binary and continuous secondary 
endpoints is equal. 
Binary endpoints were compared between groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for 
the stratification factor “geographic region”. The point estimate, the 95% confidence interval using 
normal approximation and p-value for the treatment comparison was presented. Missing values were 
imputed by non-responder imputation (NRI) (incl. the primary endpoint). In addition, exploratory 
tipping point efficacy analyses, including the primary endpoint (DAS28[CRP] at week 14), were 
performed. The overall significance level was maintained over the primary endpoint and key secondary 
endpoints with the graphical procedure defined in the figure below.

Figure 8 Graphical multiple testing procedure 
Major continuous endpoints (DAS28, HAQ-DI) were compared between groups based on their change 
from baseline using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model included endpoint at 
baseline, stratification factor “geographic region”, and treatment as fixed factors. Missing values were 
imputed by multiple imputation (MI).  
Other continuous endpoints were compared between groups using a Mixed Model with Repeated 
Measurements (MMRM) with the stratification factor “geographic region”, endpoint at baseline, visit, 
treatment, and visit x treatment interaction as fixed effect variables.  An unstructured variance-
covariance matrix was used. The parameter estimations used the method of Restricted Maximum 
Likelihood (REML) and were based on the assumption of data being missing-at-random. 
For continuous endpoints, the LS mean and 95% confidence interval was reported for each randomized 
treatment group; the LS mean treatment difference and associated 95% confidence interval was 
reported comparing each upadacitinib dose group with the combined MTX group. The nominal p-value 
was adjusted using a graph-based multiple testing procedure. 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed in demographic subgroups including age, sex, weight, 
BMI, race, geographic region, duration of RA disease diagnosis, Baseline RF status, Baseline anti-CCP 
antibody status, Baseline RF and anti-CCP, Baseline RF and anti-CCP, and Baseline DAS28 (hsCRP).

Safety analyses were performed in the Safety Analysis Set for period 1 and period 2.  Safety endpoints 
consisted of AE monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, ECG, and clinical 
laboratory testing (haematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for 
the entire study duration. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug. The FAS will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses. 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represents a subset of the FAS and consists of all FAS subjects who did 
not meet any major protocol deviations during Period 1 of the study. Additional analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be conducted on the Per Protocol analysis set, in order to evaluate the impact of 
major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations (ICH deviation and other clinically significant non-
ICH deviation) will be identified prior to database lock. 
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the "as treated" treatment 
group, regardless of the treatment randomized. The "as treated" is determined by the treatment the 
subject received during the majority of the subject's drug exposure time in the analysis period. 
Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variables 
The primary analysis for point estimate and CI will be repeated using Observed Cases without any 
imputation as a sensitivity analysis. This will be conducted on the FAS based on randomized treatment 
groups. Supportive NRI analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. 
Results  
Participant flow  
All 648 randomized subjects received study drug i.e. were included in the FAS. The proportion of 
subjects that completed Period 1 as well as the proportion of subjects that completed Period 1 study 
drug was >90% across all treatment groups.

(Select Monotherapy) 
Ancillary analyses 
For the primary endpoint, subgroup analysis according to age, gender, weight, BMI, race, geographic 
region, duration of RA, baseline serological status and baseline DAS28 (CRP) were conducted. 
Generally, a (numerical) difference vs placebo (in favour of upadacitinib) was noted for both doses in 
the analysed subgroups. 
CDAI was included among the analysis in this study. At all visits beginning at Week 2, improvement in 
disease activity with upadacitinib treatment, as shown by mean decreases in CDAI from Baseline, was 
greater (nominal P < 0.001) compared with the cMTX group for both the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 
mg groups. 
Further, analysis of DAS28 at all visits revealed that at all visits beginning at Week 2, improvement in 
disease activity with upadacitinib treatment, as shown by mean decreases in DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 
(ESR) from baseline, was greater (nominal P < 0.001) compared with the cMTX group for both the 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups.

Outcomes/Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at 
Week 12. 
Ranked key secondary endpoints (at Week 12) were: 1) change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP); 2) 
ACR20 response rate; 3) change from baseline in HAQ-DI; 4) change from baseline in SF-36 PCS. 
Other key secondary endpoints (at Week 12, if not specified) were: 1) proportion of subjects achieving 
ACR 50 response (ACR50) rate; 2) proportion of subjects achieving ACR 70 response (ACR70) rate; 3) 
proportion of subjects achieving ACR20 response at Week 1. 
There were also additional efficacy analyses, these included assessment of clinical remission.  
Randomisation   
Subjects were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology (IRT) to receive 
double-blind study drug in one of the following treatment groups: 
•  Group 1: ABT-494 30 mg QD, N = 150 (Day 1 to Week 12) → ABT-494 30 mg QD (Week 12 
and thereafter) 
•  Group 2: ABT-494 15 mg QD, N = 150 (Day 1 to Week 12) → ABT-494 15 mg QD (Week 12 
and thereafter) 
•  Group 3: Placebo, N = 75 (Day 1 to Week 12) → ABT-494 30 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter) 
•  Group 4: Placebo, N = 75 (Day 1 to Week 12) → ABT-494 15 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter) 
Randomization was stratified by number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1: failed 1 or 2 biologics with 
the same mechanism of action; stratum 2: failed ≥ 3 biologics with the same mechanism of action 
and/or multiple mechanisms of action) and geographic region.  
Once approximately 35% of the total subjects have been randomized in stratum 2, further screening of 
subjects who meet stratum 2 criteria may be suspended.

Blinding 
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the Investigator, study site personnel, and the 
subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the study. In order to maintain the 
blind, the ABT-494 tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance.  
An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 24). Study 
sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug based on treatment as randomized. The FAS will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses.  
The Per Protocol Analysis Set represents a subset of the FAS and consists of all FAS subjects who did 
not meet any major protocol violations during the study. Definitions of major protocol violations will be 
detailed in the SAP. Additional analysis may be conducted on the Per Protocol analysis set, in order to 
evaluate the impact of major protocol violations. 
The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the 
Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually 
received, regardless of the treatment randomized. 
For all efficacy analyses in Period 1, the two placebo groups (Groups 3 and 4) were combined and 
treated as one placebo group for analysis purposes. Each ABT-494 dose was compared with the 
combined placebo group. 
Comparisons of the primary endpoint were made between each ABT-494 dose and the combined 
placebo group using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors. For the 
primary analysis, non-responder imputation (NRI) was used. The analysis was repeated using 
Observed Cases (OC) and LOCF imputation. Supportive analysis was also conducted on the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set. 
For continuous endpoints between-group comparisons for each ABT-494 treatment group and the 
combined placebo groups were performed using the analysis of covariance model with treatment as 
the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the 
covariates. 
The primary efficacy analyses were performed in demographic subgroups including age, gender, 
weight, body mass index, race, and geographical region to assess the consistency of the treatment 
effect. Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease characteristics and stratification factors 
will also be conducted.

was in the placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg groups: 13.0, 22.6 and 23.6%.  
The proportion of aCCP-positive subjects was in the placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg groups: 
69.2%, 72.6% and 72.7%. Mean (SD) DAS28 (CRP) was in the placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg 
groups: 5.8 (± 1.00) 5.9 (± 0.95) 5.8 (± 0.89). 
The proportion of subjects that belonged to the stratum Prior failed bDMARDs; Stratum 1=1 
Mechanism of Action and ≤ 2 prior bDMARDs, was in the placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg groups: 
69.2%, 70.7% and 67.3%. 
According to the CSR, 38 subjects (7.6%) of the FAS were treated with leflunomide, 2 (0.4%) with 
chloroquine, 63 (12.7%) on hydroxychloroquine and 39 subjects (7.8%) were treated with

sulfasalazine. These groups could include subjects that were also on MTX; according to the CSR, 412 
(82.7%) were on concomitant treatment with MTX. 
Outcomes and Estimation 
The outcomes of the primary and key secondary endpoints are displayed in the table below. 
Table 20: Outcomes of the primary and key secondary endpoints in study M13-542 
Ancillary analyses 
The primary endpoint, LDA at week 12, was analyzed according to subgroups based on age, gender, 
weight, BMI, race, geographic region, baseline serological status, duration of RA diagnosis, baseline 
DAS28 (CRP), prior failed bDMARD use, failed at least 1 prior biologic DMARD due to lack of efficacy 
and failed anti-IL6 due to lack of efficacy.  
Overall, across the subgroups, upadacitinib performed (numerically) better than placebo. 
The outcome of the subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint according to prior failed bDMARD is 
presented in the table below.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Short-term integrated efficacy analysis 
Two integrated analysis sets of the Phase 3 studies were defined for the purpose of short-term 
integrated efficacy analyses (ISE SAP). In both integrated analysis sets, the randomization ratio 
between upadacitinib and control is the same across all the studies being integrated: 
• 
Placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg analysis set: The objective of this analysis set was to 
compare upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo on top of background MTX and/or other 
csDMARDs. This analysis set integrated the placebo-controlled studies that included 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD as a treatment arm. Specifically, it included subjects from the following 
studies: Studies M13-549, M14-465, and M13-542. Subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 
placebo groups were included in this analysis set. 
• 
Placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg analysis set: The objective of this analysis 
set was to compare upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo on top of 
background csDMARDs. This analysis set integrated the placebo-controlled studies that 
included both upadacitinib 15 mg QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD as treatment arms.

Specifically, it included subjects from the following studies: Studies M13-549 and M13-542. 
Subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, and placebo groups were 
included in this analysis set. 
No discrepancies were found between the integrated data and study-specific data. 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
To examine efficacy across subpopulations, subgroup analyses were conducted for ACR20 and LDA 
based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 for the two integrated analysis sets (placebo-controlled 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD and placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg QD analysis sets) for the 
following subgroups: age, gender, weight, BMI, race, geographic region, baseline rheumatoid factor 
status, baseline anti-CCP antibody status, and background csDMARD at baseline (only applicable to the 
placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg analysis set), and prior bDMARD intolerance.  
The figure below provides the LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) results on the pooled analysis set [placebo-
controlled upadacitinib 15mg]. Similar results were obtained for ACR20 (data not shown here). 
Figure 11 LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) results on the pooled analysis set [placebo-controlled upadacitinib 
15mg] 
Efficacy of Upadacitinib in bDMARD-Intolerant Subjects 
The short-term efficacy of upadacitinib was assessed in bDMARD-intolerant subjects versus other 
bDMARD-exposed subjects (that discontinued bDMARD therapy due to lack of efficacy or other 
reasons). This analysis was based on CHMP Scientific Advice to support the use of upadacitinib in 
bDMARD-intolerant subjects. Subgroup analysis was performed for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 
(CRP) at Week 12 in the two integrated analysis sets i.e. the placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg 
and placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg analysis sets (as described above).  The 
outcomes of these two analyses in the placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg are presented in the 
tables below.

Efficacy of Upadacitinib in Combination with MTX Versus Other csDMARDs 
To examine the short-term placebo-controlled efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with MTX versus 
other csDMARDs, a model-based analysis assessing the interaction between treatment effect and 
background csDMARD type was conducted for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 
within Studies M13-542 and M13-549, respectively, where csDMARDs other than MTX were permitted 
as background therapy per protocol. Note that subjects on a combination of MTX plus other csDMARDs 
were counted under MTX. Logistic regression was performed with treatment (upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD, and placebo) and background csDMARD type (MTX versus other), as well as 
the interaction term between treatment and background csDMARD type as the fixed factors.

Demographic and baseline covariates were adjusted in the model. The p-value for the interaction term 
between treatment and background csDMARD type was reported. NRI was used for missing data 
imputation on the response variable. 
The outcomes of these analyses are presented in the figures and tables below.

Cross-Study Indirect Comparison of Upadacitinib Monotherapy Versus Upadacitinib + MTX 
Combination Therapy 
In accordance with recommendations received during CHMP Scientific Advice, a cross-study analysis 
was conducted to provide an indirect comparison of the efficacy of upadacitinib as monotherapy versus 
in combination with MTX in the MTX-IR population. This analysis was primarily conducted to support 
the use of upadacitinib monotherapy in a MTX-IR population. A model-based analysis was conducted 
on subjects from Studies M13-549 and M15-555, as these two studies had similar patient 
characteristics based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be consistent with the MTX-IR 
population in the monotherapy Study M15-555, subjects in Study M13-549 who were MTX-IR with no 
prior exposure to bDMARD were included in this analysis. Analyses were conducted for ACR20 and LDA 
based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 (Study M13-549)/Week 14 (Study M15-555). 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 99/201 
 
 
 
 
Logistic regression was performed with treatment group as the fixed factor and adjusting for 
demographic and baseline covariates. The comparison between monotherapy and combination therapy 
(for upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, respectively) was based on the contrast between the cMTX 
group-adjusted upadacitinib monotherapy treatment effect and placebo group-adjusted upadacitinib 
combination treatment effect (on the logit scale). The p-value for this comparison was reported. NRI 
was used for missing data imputation on the response variables. 
Baseline variables including sex, age, race, serological status and disease activity were compared 
across the treatment groups included in the analysis; in all treatment groups the majority of subjects 
were female (ranged from 75.2% to 82.9% across groups), mean age was around 55 years (ranged 
from 53.1 to 56.2 across groups), a majority of subjects were aCCP-positive (ranged from 68.6% to 
81.1% across groups) and had a high mean disease activity measured as DAS28 (ranged from 5.5-5.7 
across groups). 
The outcome of this analysis is presented in the table below.

Patient reported outcomes (PROs) 
As recommended in the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (CPMP/EWP/556/95 Rev. 2), the Phase 3 studies included several PROs as 
secondary outcome measures. Most of the PROs in the Ph3 trials were previously validated and widely 
used in clinical trials. These include the Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index [HAQ-DI] 
for measuring physical function and disability, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-
Fatigue (FACIT-F) for the assessment of fatigue, and Short Form-36 (SF-36) and EuroQoL-5D-5L (EQ-
5D-5L) as measures of general quality of life. Work Instability Scale for RA (RA-WIS) was used to 
measure work instability (WI) in patients with RA. It is applicable only to patients who are employed. 
Additionally visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for the patient’s perception of disease activity 
(Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity) and intensity of pain (Patient's Assessment of Pain 
VAS) and for measuring the study site’s assessment of disease activity (Physician Global Assessment of 
Disease Activity VAS). 
The applicant also created the measure on severity and duration of morning stiffness, a typical 
symptom of RA. This new measure has been validated by the Applicant. 
As the results of different PROs were concordant, only the results of HAQ-DI are included here (see 
figure below).

Pivotal Phase 3 Studies (MI; FAS) 
Long-term efficacy analysis: Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects 
Long-term efficacy analyses were conducted for each of the five Phase 3 studies separately. Efficacy 
data are presented through Week 60 for Studies M13-549 and M13-542 and through Week 48 for 
Studies M13-545, M14-465, and M15-555, with approximately 78%, 74%, 80%, 87%, and 84%,

respectively, of subjects remaining in the study through the last summarized visit (by the data cut-off 
date). Descriptive statistics for long-term efficacy are reported by treatment sequence based on AO 
data. For Studies M13-545 and M14-465 (which have longer-term active comparator arms), additional 
analysis by randomized group were presented by the applicant with rescue handling using NRI for 
binary endpoints and using last observation carried forward (LOCF) for continuous endpoints (with the 
exception of rescue in Study M14-465 at Week 26 based on CDAI LDA, where LOCF was used for 
binary endpoints). These long-term comparisons were not among the ranked key secondary endpoints 
and therefore were not subject to multiplicity control. Nominal p-values were used as descriptive 
measures. 
All analyses for long-term efficacy were to be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population that 
includes all randomized subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug. 
The primary endpoint for study M13-545 and M14-465 was CR based on DAS28 CRP (at week 24 and 
week 12 respectively) while the primary endpoint in study M13-549, M15-555 and M13-542 was LDA 
based on DAS28 CRP (at week 12, 14 and 12 respectively). All these studies were reported to be on-
going. The focus of the presentation of persistence of effect for the respective studies was on the 
outcomes of the primary endpoints. 
Persistence of LDA: study M13-549, M15-555 and M13-542 
The following three figures display LDA over time in the three pivotal studies in which LDA was the 
primary endpoint. The added text below each respective figure indicate the number of subjects that 
were responders and number of subjects assessed in each group at different timepoints.

Structural Joint Damage 
In study M13-545, radiographic assessment of structural joint damage was performed for up to Week 
48. The radiographic data presented in the CSR for Study M13-545 were based on results from reading 
session 1, which included all available images from Baseline and Week 24 as of the data cut-off date of 
15 March 2018. In contrast, the radiographic data for Study M13-545 presented in response to the Day 
120 List of Questions are based on results from reading session 2, which included all available images 
from Baseline, Week 24, and Week 48 (1-year x-ray data) as of the data cut-off date of 21 February 
2019.  In reading session 2, images from Baseline and Week 24 were re-read, and images from Week 
48 were read for the first time. Results from reading session 2, including the number of subjects with 
images for both linear extrapolation and as observed (AO) analyses, are presented in the table below.

Other outcome measures over time 
Other outcome measures, such as ACR 20, 50 and 70 as well as HAQ and CDAI-based LDA were also 
measured over time: the descriptive presentation of the results indicate that the improvements were 
largely maintained beyond the timepoint at which the primary efficacy analysis was conducted. 
2.5.2.1.  Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical studies targeting special age groups or patients with renal or hepatic impairment were 
performed. Patients with eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73m2 were excluded from the Ph3 trials, so no data are 
available for subjects with severe renal impairment. In total 105 patients with eGFR 
30-60 mL/min/1.73m2 had been treated with UPA 15mg in the Ph3 trials. This constitutes only about

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies (methods) 
Design of the three dose-finding studies 
Study M13-537 (n=299); the dose-ranging study in RA-patients failing MTX, investigated 5 different 
doses of upadacitinib ranging from 3 mg BID to 18 mg BID given as immediate-release capsules.  
Study M13-550 (n=276); the dose-ranging study in RA-patients failing anti-TNF, investigated four 
different doses of upadacitinib ranging from 3 mg BID to 18 mg BID given as immediate-release 
capsules.  
Study M14-663 (n=197) assessed dose-response for upadacitinib in three doses; 7.5 mg QD, 15 mg 
QD, and 30 mg QD given as extended-release tablets in a Japanese, csDMARD-IR population.  
The primary endpoint in all the three dose-finding studies was ACR20 at week 12. This endpoint is, as 
stated in the relevant EMA guideline, appropriate for use in exploratory dose-finding trials. The time 
point for evaluation of the primary endpoint is also appropriate and consistent with the guideline. 
Further, the secondary endpoints assessed in these studies pertained to clinical efficacy and were 
adequate. 
Design of the five main clinical studies  
In all the 5 phase III-studies, for the analysis of the primary endpoint, non-responder imputation (NRI) 
was used. 
Study M13-545 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Once 
Daily Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in MTX-Naïve Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis” (Select Early)” included subjects with active RA with negative 
prognostic factors. The proposed indication did not include the patients studied in M13-545. The 
inclusion/exclusion criteria are reasonable, and the study still confers data of importance for the overall 
assessment. 
Study M13-545 compared upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus 
MTX monotherapy. The design of the study is adequate and MTX is an appropriate comparator since it 
represents standard of care for this patient population. The primary endpoint was the proportion of 
subjects achieving CR defined by DAS28 [CRP] < 2.6 at Week 24 which is in line with relevant EMA 
guideline and previous CHMP Advice. The analysis was conducted on FAS (n=945) which included all 
randomized subjects (n=947) who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects who meet joint 
count rescue criteria at Week 16 or 20 were treated as non-responders at Week 24 for the primary 
analysis, this is considered reasonable. The key secondary endpoints include HAQ-DI (function), ACR 
50 response rate, LDA and mTSS (Structural joint damage as visualized by X–rays). This is in line with

current EMA guideline.  Overall, the endpoints measure different aspects of the RA disease and are of 
clinical relevance. 
The interim week 24 report (CSR) for Study M13-545 was submitted. A long-term extension of the 
study is on-going. An “Integrated Summary of Efficacy” (ISE) that contains long-term data for all 
individual studies (i.e., beyond the individual CSR cut-off dates) was submitted along with the CSRs in 
this application. This ISE includes week 48-data from study M13-545 (i.e. data spanning the complete 
double-blind period of the study). This approach was supported by the CHMP.  
Study M13-549 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Are on a Stable Dose 
of Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) and Have an 
Inadequate Response to csDMARDs (Select Next)” included subjects with active RA that had failed at 
least one of the following: MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. From the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
the title of the study, “failure” seems to imply “inadequate response”. Subjects that were “considered 
inadequate responders to biological DMARD (bDMARD) therapy” were excluded but subjects with prior 
exposure to at most one bDMARD were eligible to be enrolled in the study -up to 20% of total number 
of subjects- if they had either exposure<3 months or had to discontinue due to intolerability.  
Study M13-549 compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD versus placebo as add-on to stable 
dose of csDMARDs. The study design is overall adequate. The primary endpoint was LDA based on 
DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 which is in line with relevant EMA guideline and previous CHMP Advice. 
The analysis was conducted on FAS (n=661) which included all randomized subjects (n=661) who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. The secondary endpoints include assessment of HAQ-DI, 
remission and ACR response; this is also in line with the EMA guideline and previous advice. Overall, 
the selected endpoints cover relevant aspects of the RA disease. In addition, the proportion of subjects 
achieving LDA based on CDAI ≤ 10 was included as a ranked key secondary endpoint. This is 
appropriate as this is a CRP-independent outcome measure. 
Study M13-549 tested two sets of equality hypotheses in a Full Analysis Set (FAS) population using a 
pre-specified primary endpoint with two categories and other secondary endpoints at week 12. The 
statistical methods including statistical tests and models, imputation of missing values, and multiple 
testing procedures are considered appropriate and sufficiently conservative.  
The first period of M13-549 was only 12 weeks and there seem to have been no rescue therapy during 
this period which is adequate. The current submission includes a CSR for Period 1. The ISE includes 
week 60-data. This approach was supported by the CHMP. 
Study M14-465” A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo and to Adalimumab in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who 
are on a Stable Background of Methotrexate (MTX) and Who Have an Inadequate Response to MTX 
(MTX-IR) (Select Compare)” included subjects with active RA who had negative prognostic factors. In 
the previous CHMP SA it was commented that positive aCCP or RF should be mandatory to ensure that 
patients are at high risk of progression. The applied inclusion criteria are not entirely consistent with 
this as subjects were to have either ≥ 3 bone erosions on x-ray at screening or ≥ 1 bone erosion with 
positive serology (aCCP or RF). However, the deviation from the given advice is considered acceptable 
given that patients that already have ≥ 3 bone erosions at screening are believed to have a sufficiently 
high risk of progression. The study included primarily MTX-inadequate responders defined in an 
acceptable way. Although subjects who were considered bDMARD inadequate responders were 
excluded, subjects with prior exposure to at most one bDMARD were eligible to be enrolled if they had 
either exposure <3 months or had to discontinue the bDMARD due to intolerability. Overall, the patient 
population is adequately selected and relevant in the view of the CHMP.

Study M14-465 compared upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo, and versus adalimumab (per 
approved label) as add-on to MTX. The study design is overall adequate and adalimumab is appropriate 
as a comparator since it represents one of possible standard-of-care options for this population. The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving CR based on DAS28 CRP < 2.6 at Week 12. 
The analysis was conducted on FAS (n=1629) which included all randomized subjects (n=1629) who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug. The ranked secondary endpoints include: ACR20 response, 
structural damage, physical function, quality of life and fatigue. LDA based on CDAI was included 
among the ranked key secondary variables. These secondary endpoints were all also assessed at week 
12, except for the radiological outcomes that were assessed at week 26. Overall, the selected 
endpoints were considered in line with EMA guideline and clinically relevant by the CHMP.  
In study M14-465, at week 26 all subjects receiving placebo were to be switched to upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD regardless of response. Patients in all three groups could also be rescued and switch group at 
Weeks 14, 18, 22 or 26. For the radiological endpoints, linear extrapolation was used for missing data 
and treatment-switching handling. Analysis was also conducted based on AO data. This was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP considering that explicit demonstration of haltering radiological progression is 
not a prerequisite for approval of new RA-drugs. 
For study M14-465, the randomized, double blind first period of the study M14-465 lasted 48 weeks. 
The interim week 26 CSR was included in the current submission. The ISE includes week 48-data. This 
approach was supported by the CHMP. 
Study M15-555 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) 
Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid 
Arthritis with Inadequate Response to MTX (Select Monotherapy)” included subjects with active RA. 
The study population that will be captured by the inclusion and exclusion criteria was considered 
adequate. The definition of MTX-IR is considered acceptable. 
Study M15-555 compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD alone and 15 mg QD alone versus continuing MTX 
alone in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design. In a previous Advice, the CHMP 
commented that little useful information is expected to be generated by the superiority comparison of 
the drug versus MTX as the MTX arm is being undertreated by definition. The CHMP stated that to 
support a monotherapy indication in second-line, at minimum an indirect comparison of efficacy and 
safety of monotherapy versus combination with MTX in the same second-line population (i.e. MTX-IR) 
should be conducted. To adhere to this, the applicant conducted cross-study comparisons. This 
approach was supported by the CHMP. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving 
LDA (based on DAS28 [CRP] ≤ 3.2) at Week 14. The analysis was conducted on FAS (n=648) which 
included all randomized subjects (n=648) who received at least 1 dose of study drug. No rescue was 
allowed before the timepoint at which the primary endpoint was analysed. The ranked key secondary 
endpoints were also assessed at week 14 and included CR, ACR response and physical function. The 
selected endpoints are in line with EMA guideline and overall in line with the previous CHMP scientific 
advice given. CR was assessed at week 14 instead of at 6 months as recommended in the previous 
CHMP scientific advice given. However, that was considered acceptable to the CHMP considering that 
the study continued beyond the week 14 timepoint (=end of study period 1, which was included in the 
CSR and was the timepoint after which all patients received upadacitinib) and that efficacy data up to 
week 48 were presented in the current submission to support maintenance of effect. 
The M15-555 study tested two sets of equality hypotheses in a Full Analysis Set (FAS) population using 
a pre-specified primary endpoint with two categories and other secondary endpoints at week 14. The 
statistical methods including statistical tests and models, imputation of missing values, and multiple 
testing procedures are considered appropriate and sufficiently conservative to support the claims.

Study M13-542 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo on Stable Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis with Inadequate Response or 
Intolerance to Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) (Select Beyond)” included subjects with active RA that 
failed at least one bDMARD either due to inadequate response or non-tolerability. The patient 
population was considered adequately selected. 
Study M13-542 compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD versus placebo as add-on to a stable 
dose of csDMARDs in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group design during the first 12 weeks of 
the study. This period included no rescue possibilities. As commented in the previous CHMP Scientific 
Advice, the design of this study is not optimal for studying the effect of upadacitinib in a third line 
population; “investigator’s best choice” would have been a more appropriate comparator than placebo. 
At the CHMP’s request, the Applicant discussed the effect. It was agreed that discontinuation of prior 
bDMARD therapy in the placebo arm did probably not have marked effect on the obtained efficacy 
results. In addition, some support for the third line indication also comes from other studies in the 
development programme. In relation to this, it is noted that study M14-465 and study M13-549 
allowed inclusion of subjects that had discontinued bDMARD due to intolerability - although these two 
studies included subjects that had either documented evidence of intolerance or exposure <3 month 
which was not in complete agreement with previous CHMP scientific advice given - and one of the 
three treatment arms in M14-465 was adalimumab which could be considered as a possible standard-
of-care in this third line population (subjects previously treated with adalimumab were excluded from 
this study ).  In conclusion, despite the design limitations in study M13-542, the data from the study 
together with data from other studies in the development programme could be supportive of a third 
line indication.  
Study M13-542 had LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at week 12 as the primary endpoint. The 
analysis was conducted on FAS (n=498) which included all randomized subjects (n=499) who received 
at least 1 dose of study drug. The ranked key secondary endpoints included ACR response, physical 
function and quality of life assessment and were also assessed at week 12. The primary and key 
secondary endpoints are in line with the relevant EMA guideline and cover relevant aspects of the 
disease. CR was not included among the key secondary endpoints (which would have been adequate 
and in line with the previous CHMP Scientific Advice), but assessment of CR was at least included 
among the additional efficacy analysis. This is acceptable considering the totality of data (including 
data from the 4 other pivotal studies that include CR as a primary or key secondary endpoint) and as it 
is not explicitly stated in the EMA guideline that CR is mandatory as a key secondary endpoint in this 
third-line population. The current submission includes the Period 1 CSR (24 weeks). Week 60-data was 
included in the ISE. 
In summary, the design of the design of the five main clinical trials are considered in line with current 
EMA guideline and sufficiently coherent with previously given CHMP Advice to be able to yield adequate 
and sufficient efficacy data for potential approval of upadacitinib in the proposed indication.  
Some deviations from previously given CHMP advice have been noted such as CRP cut-off for active 
disease in the pivotal studies and definitions of bDMARD intolerance, but these were not considered 
crucial by the CHMP for the assessment of the effect size of upadacitinib vs the comparator. The 
number of subjects who had inadequate response to other csDMARDs than MTX is small. However, it is 
plausible that this new mode of action (JAK-inhibition) would have similar efficacy and safety after MTX 
or other csDMARDs.

Efficacy data and additional analyses (results) 
Data from the three dose-finding studies 
Based on the data from these three studies, the applicant chose 15 mg QD extended-release 
(equivalent to 6 mg BID immediate-release) and 30 mg QD extended-release (equivalent 12 mg BID 
immediate-release) as the doses to be tested in the phase 3 programme. The choice seems reasonable 
to the CHMP. The applicant explains that the extended-release formulation was developed to enable 
QD dosing and thus enhance patient compliance and provide more convenient dosing regimen. The 
recommended dose of upadacitinib is 15 mg once daily. 
Data from five main clinical studies 
M13-545 
In M13-545, the proportion of randomized MTX-naïve subjects that completed week 24 study drug was 
85.1% in the MTX group, 91.5% in the UPA 15 mg group and 89.5% in the UPA 30 mg group. Overall, 
the numbers of subjects rescued were low. There was no notable asymmetry between the treatment 
groups with regards to important baseline parameters.  
In M13-545, the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the primary endpoint CR at week 24 
was in the MTX monotherapy (n=314), UPA 15 mg monotherapy (n=317) and UPA 30 mg 
monotherapy (n=314): 18.5 (14.2, 22.8), 48.3 (42.8, 53.8) and 50.0 (44.5, 55.5) %, p 0.001 for both 
comparisons between MTX and upa. The difference between both the UPA groups relative to MTX are 
both statistically significant and highly clinically relevant. The outcomes of the key secondary 
endpoints, including the two radiological ranked key endpoints, are in line with the outcome of the 
primary endpoint. The proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression at week 24 was in the 
MTX, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg group: 77.7%, 87.5% and 89.3% (nominal p-value 0.002 and 
<0.001 for the two respective comparisons with MTX).In M13-545, statistically significant 
improvements in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the MTX group were 
observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment. Overall, the 30mg dose 
seemed to perform only marginally better than the 15mg dose. It is noted that such a reduction 
compared to baseline was achieved by all three groups at week 12 but also that the difference in point 
estimate between the upadacitinib groups and the MTX group for this variable were >0.22. 
In M13-545, no unexpected findings of significant importance were noted in the presented subgroup 
analysis. There are indications of a relatively rapid treatment response; an effect was reported as early 
as week 2 for some outcomes including mean decreases in DAS28 (CRP) from baseline. 
In summary, Study M13-545 demonstrates that when upadacitinib 15 mg monotherapy is given as 1st 
line RA treatment, after 6 months, 48.3% of the patients achieve the very high hurdle endpoint clinical 
remission. The corresponding figure for MTX monotherapy (which represents standard of care first line 
RA treatment) is 18.5%. At this timepoint, the proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression 
is also higher in the upadacitinib 15 mg group than in the MTX group. The Applicant did not claim a 1st 
line RA indication. However, those data are indicative of favourable effects also in the proposed target 
population (2nd and 3rd line indication). 
M13-549 
In M13-549, in all treatment groups >90% of csDMARD-IR subjects completed study period 1 as well 
as study drug during period 1 and there were no rescue possibilities during this time period. The three 
treatment groups were overall fairly well balanced with regards to important baseline variables. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 114/201 
 
 
 
proportion of subjects with csDMARD other than MTX was in the placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg 
groups: 13.6%, 23.2% and 20.1%.  
In M13-549, the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the primary endpoint LDA at week 12, 
was in the Placebo, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg groups:  17.2 (12.2, 22.2), 48.4 (41.8, 55.0) and 47.9 
(41.3, 54.6) %, p <0.001 for both comparisons between the active treatment arms and placebo. The 
difference between placebo and upadacitinib are both clinical and statistically significant for both the 
tested doses. The same conclusion can be drawn for the outcome of the secondary endpoint analyses 
that included LDA based on CDAI, a CRP-independent outcome measure. 
In M13-549, statistically significant improvement in both the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD 
groups compared with the placebo group were observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using 
multiplicity adjustment. The 30mg dose does not seem to perform substantially better than the 15-mg 
dose. Already at week 1, an effect on ACR 20 vs placebo was seen; ACR 20 response rate for UPA 15 
mg was 22.2% compared to 8.6% in the placebo group, p<0.001 for the comparison.  
M14-465 
In M14-465, a higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group were rescued after the Week 14, 18 
and 22 visits compared to the proportion of subjects rescued in the adalimumab and upadacitinib 
groups at those timepoints. The proportion of subjects that had discontinued study drug by week 14 
was fairly similar and low in all treatment groups. Overall, a rather low number with similar magnitude 
in the different treatment groups, appear to have discontinued study drug between week 14 and 26. 
More than 90% completed week 26 on study drug which is of importance for the interpretation of the 
findings from the radiological analysis.  
In M14-465, baseline characteristics of importance were overall balanced between the three treatment 
groups.  
In study M14-465, the primary endpoint, CR at week 12, was achieved by 28.7% when upadacitinib 15 
mg was added to MTX. For subjects that received placebo, the figure was 6.1%, p<0.001 for the 
comparison between the groups.  The outcomes of the other key secondary endpoints, including the 
radiological endpoint and the CRP-independent outcome LDA based on CDAI, were consistent with the 
outcome of the primary endpoint; the differences vs placebo was both clinically and statistically 
convincing. Statistically significant improvement with upadacitinib 15 mg QD group compared with the 
placebo group were observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment. The 
proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression at week 26 was 76.0% in the placebo group 
and 83.5% in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, p=0.001 for the comparison.  
In study M14-465, one of the key secondary endpoints involved a comparison vs the active comparator 
adalimumab; the proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (non-
inferiority comparison of upadacitinib versus adalimumab). This endpoint (95% CI) was achieved in 
28.7 (23.8, 33.7) in the adalimumab group and 45.0 (41.2, 48.8) % in the upadacitinib group. The 
non-inferiority margin was 10% but the point estimate (95% CI) for between group difference was 
16.3 (10.0, 22.5) % i.e. non-inferiority was met.  
In study M14-465, in all the examined subgroups, a (numerical) difference vs placebo was observed.  
It is of interest that UPA 15 mg does not perform worse in the subgroup with previous bDMARD use 
compared to group with no previous bDMARD use. Thus, when upadacitinib 15 mg is added to MTX in a 
group of MTX-IR patients that also have previous bDMARD experience, 31.5% of the subjects achieve 
the high-hurdle endpoint clinical remission (based on DAS28) at week 12. It should however be noted 
that according to the eligibility criteria, only patients with <3 month exposure of bDMARD/who had 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 115/201 
 
 
 
discontinued bDMARD due to intolerability could be included. The data supports of a rapid onset of 
effect (detected as early as week 2) of upadacitinib. 
M15-555 
In M15-555, a sufficiently high and equal proportion of the MTX-IR subjects in the three treatment 
groups completed Period 1 and completed study drug during this period i.e. stayed in the study long 
enough to be evaluated both for the primary and key secondary endpoints. Baseline characteristics of 
importance were overall sufficiently well balanced between the three treatment groups.  
In study M15-555, the primary endpoint, LDA at week 14 was achieved by 19.4% in the MTX-group vs 
44.7% in the UPA 15 mg monotherapy group and 53.0% in the UPA 30 mg monotherapy group, 
p<0.001 for both comparisons between MTX and upa. The results for the key secondary endpoints 
were in line with primary endpoint. Statistically significant improvement in both the upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the cMTX group were observed for all ranked key secondary 
endpoints using multiplicity adjustment. Although the superiority comparison between MTX and 
upadacitinib that was carried out in this study has its clear limitations (the MTX arm being 
undertreated by definition in a genuine MTX-IR population) almost half of patients that have active RA 
and are MTX-IR do achieve low disease activity with upadacitinib monotherapy in the proposed 
posology (15 mg once daily). LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 was achieved by 45.0% of 
the MTX-IR subjects in the Upadacitinib group 15 mg + MTX group in the M14-465 study which is 
similar to the outcome of Upadacitinib monotherapy in study M15-555. Further, clinical remission at 
week 12 based on DAS28 (CRP) was achieved by 28.7% of the MTX-IR RA-patients when upadacitinib 
was added to MTX in study M14-465 which is also similar to the outcome for this endpoint in the 
monotherapy study M15-555.  
In M15-555, in general, a numerical difference vs placebo was noted for in the analysed subgroups. 
The treatment effect was seen early which indicates rapid onset of action. Analysis of DAS28 at all 
visits revealed that at all visits beginning at Week 2, improvement in disease activity with upadacitinib 
treatment, as shown by mean decreases in DAS28 (CRP) and DAS28 (ESR) from Baseline, was greater 
(nominal P < 0.001) compared with the cMTX group for both the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg 
groups. 
M13-542 
In M13-542, a sufficiently high and equal number of subjects across treatment groups completed week 
12 study participation and week 12 study drug i.e. were still in the study and on the study drug at the 
time point at which the primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary endpoints were assessed. 
Baseline characteristics of importance were overall sufficiently well balanced between the three 
treatment groups.  
In study M13-542, the primary endpoint, LDA at week 12, was achieved by 43.3% in the UPA 15 mg 
group, 42.4% in the UPA 30 mg group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p<0.001 for both comparisons 
between UPA and placebo. Although the limitations with regards to the comparison with placebo are 
acknowledged, it is still considered clearly clinically relevant that >40% of subjects in this difficult to 
treat population achieved LDA with 12-week treatment. The achieved difference between upadacitinib 
and placebo could probably not be explained only by the fact that prior bDMARDs were stopped without 
replacement in the placebo arms. The outcomes of the key secondary endpoints were overall in line 
with the outcome of the primary endpoint. Statistically significant improvement in both the 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the placebo group were observed for all 
ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment.  Already at week 1, an effect on ACR 
response vs placebo was seen: 27.4% in the UPA 15 mg group vs 10.7% in the placebo group.  In 
study M13-542, 30 mg upadacitinib did not perform consistently better than 15 mg upadacitinib.

In study M13-542, across the subgroups, upadacitinib performed better than placebo. No analysis 
according to concomitant csDMARD could be found. To support the proposed indication for use “in 
combination with methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)”, it would have 
been of value to present a descriptive analysis of the outcome of the primary endpoint in subjects that 
were treated with concomitant leflunomide, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine without 
also receiving MTX.  
Data in special populations 
No clinical studies targeting special age groups or patients with renal or hepatic impairment were 
performed. Patients with eGFR < 40 mL/min/1.73m2 were excluded from the Phase 3 trials, so no data 
are available for subjects with severe renal impairment. As stated in the SmPC, upadacitinib should be 
used with caution in patients with severe renal impairment and the use of upadacitinib has not been 
studied in subjects with end stage renal disease. In addition, upadacitinib is contraindicated in severe 
hepatic impairment patients. See clinical pharmacology discussions. 
The data indicates that upadacitinib 15 mg was similarly efficacious in different age strata. There are 
limited data in patients aged 75 years and older. 
Data from analysis performed across trials 
Several integrated analyses across trial were conducted by the applicant. Two integrated analysis sets 
of the Phase 3 studies were defined for the purpose of short-term integrated efficacy analyses:  
• 
Placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg analysis set: The objective of this analysis set was to 
compare upadacitinib 15 mg QD versus placebo on top of background MTX and/or other 
csDMARDs. This analysis set integrated the placebo-controlled studies that included 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD as a treatment arm. Specifically, it included subjects from the following 
studies: Studies M13-549, M14-465, and M13-542. Subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 
placebo groups were included in this analysis set. 
• 
Placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg analysis set: The objective of this analysis 
set was to compare upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo on top of 
background csDMARDs. This analysis set integrated the placebo-controlled studies that 
included both upadacitinib 15 mg QD and upadacitinib 30 mg QD as treatment arms. 
Specifically, it included subjects from the following studies: Studies M13-549 and M13-542. 
Subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD, upadacitinib 30 mg QD, and placebo groups were 
included in this analysis set. 
Subgroup analysis 
The integrated analyses yielded similar results that were obtained in the respective studies separately. 
The subgroup analyses were overall consistent with the primary analysis. Although UPA was overall 
efficacious, it seemed less efficacious in those patients with higher weight (in line with higher BMI): 
e.g. LDA response was 40.7 for those <60kg and 23.4 for those >100kg, with overlapping Cis.  
However, upadacitinib had a clinically relevant treatment effect across all weight groups. Furthermore, 
baseline weight did not affect safety (see Safety section). Hence, the CHMP was of the opinion that no 
guidance was needed regarding use of upadacitinib according to baseline weight. Also, pooled analysis 
and individual studies suggest that efficacy is better in those with poor prognostic factors (RF, anti-
CCP). However, the therapeutic effect is positive across subgroups and several other factors than 
seropositivity are relevant for the choice of therapy. Hence, the CHMP was of the opinion that those 
subgroup results were not relevant for the treatment recommendations in the SmPC.

bDMARD-intolerant subjects 
The short-term efficacy of upadacitinib was assessed in bDMARD-intolerant subjects versus other 
bDMARD-exposed subjects (that discontinued bDMARD therapy due to lack of efficacy or other 
reasons). Subgroup analysis was performed for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 in 
the two integrated analysis sets i.e. the placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo-controlled 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg analysis sets (as described above). The outcome of this analysis, in 
both analysis sets, indicate that bDMARD-intolerant subjects do equally well on Upadacitinib as 
subjects that discontinued bDMARD therapy due to other reasons.  
Non-MTX csDMARDs 
The short-term efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with MTX versus other non-MTX csDMARDs was 
analysed in order to support the use of upadacitinib in combination with csDMARDs (MTX and other 
csDMARDs). To examine the short-term placebo-controlled efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with 
MTX versus other csDMARDs, a model-based analysis assessing the interaction between treatment 
effect and background csDMARD type was conducted for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at 
Week 12 within Studies M13-542 and M13-549, respectively, where csDMARDs other than MTX were 
permitted as background therapy. It should be noted that subjects on a combination of MTX plus other 
csDMARDs were counted under MTX. The outcome of this analysis indicated that, with regards to the 
efficacy, subjects that received upadacitinib did well both when the drug was combined with MTX and 
when the drug was combined with other csDMARDs. There were some minor differences observed 
between the two groups. Thus, from an efficacy-point-of view, the Applicant’s claim for an indication 
“in combination with other csDMARDs than MTX” could potentially be supported. However, there are 
difficulties associated with drawing solid conclusions on the subgroups that included a low number of 
subjects. In addition, this claim was not approvable from a safety perspective (see Safety Section). 
Monotherapy 
In line with the Scientific Advice, a cross-study analysis was conducted to provide an indirect 
comparison of the short-term efficacy of upadacitinib as monotherapy versus in combination with MTX 
in the MTX-IR population. A model-based analysis was conducted on subjects from Studies M13-549 
and M15-555 as the populations in these studies was considered to have sufficiently similar baseline 
characteristics to enable the analysis. Analyses were conducted for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 
(CRP) at Week 12 (Study M13-549)/Week 14 (Study M15-555).  The outcome of these analysis 
indicate similar short-term efficacy is achieved by upadacitinib monotherapy compared to upadacitinib 
+ MTX although slight numerical differences in the response rate difference based on LDA (25.3% for 
UPA 15mg monotherapy arm compared to 30.5% for the UPA + MTX arm) and on ACR20 (26.5% vs 
28.0%) was noted. For the 30 mg dose, the outcomes are similar for the monotherapy vs the 
combination and with this dose, the slight numerical difference in response rate between the two 
treatment arms actually being in favour of monotherapy (34.0% for UPA 30 mg monotherapy and 
31.5%% for UPA 30 mg + MTX for response rate difference based on LDA and 30.0% and 27.2% for 
response rate difference based on ACR20). The benefit of upadacitinib monotherapy vs the 
combination with MTX is not clear in terms of effect on radiological progression. Radiological 
progression was measured as a key secondary outcome in two studies; M13-545 and M14-465 in 
which one was indeed a monotherapy study (M13-545) and the other was not (M14-465 was designed 
as an add-on-to-MTX-study). However, a direct comparison between the outcome of these studies 
cannot be made since M14-465 included MTX-IR and M13-545 included MTX-naïve. In summary, the 
CHMP was of the opinion that both the combination therapy and monotherapy ≥ second line are 
considered supported by the data submitted.

PROs 
The results of PROs were overall similar across all Phase 3 trials.  
Maintenance of efficacy 
According to the relevant EMA guideline, maintenance of efficacy should be demonstrated in a long-
term randomized study where blinding and an active control is maintained for in total 12 months study 
duration. Descriptive statistics may suffice and no formal non-inferiority analyses are required.  The 
applicant stated that long-term efficacy analyses were conducted for each of the five Phase 3 studies 
separately. Efficacy data are presented through Week 60 for Studies M13-549 and M13-542 and 
through Week 48 for Studies M13-545 (active control until week 48), M14-465 (active control until 
week 48), and M15-555, with approximately 78%, 74%, 80%, 87%, and 84%, respectively, of 
subjects remaining in the study through the last summarized visit (by the data cut-off date). It was for 
all studies stated that after the unblinded analysis for the pivotal efficacy endpoints had been 
conducted, subjects and sites remained blinded to the end of the so called “blinded periods” (Period 1 
in Study M13-545, Period 2 in Study M13-549, Period 1 in Study M14-465, Period 2 in Study M15-555, 
Period 2 in study M13-542). Acknowledging the limitations of the presented descriptive as observed 
data, the treatment effect of upadacitinib, including the joint damage preventing effect measured in 
study M13-545 and M14-465 appears to be maintained up to and beyond one year. Thus, overall, the 
requirements of the guideline were considered fulfilled by the CHMP.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The designs of the three dose-finding studies are adequate and the outcome supported the dose 
selection in the main clinical phase 3 studies. The design of the five main clinical studies was 
considered acceptable and overall in line with the EMA guideline. Although some deviations from 
previous CHMP Scientific Advice have been noted, the CHMP did not consider that these deviations 
significantly influence the ability to draw conclusions from the data yielded. 
The data submitted support that upadacitinib, in the proposed posology 15 mg once daily, has a 
clinically relevant effect in inducing remission or low disease activity in patients with active RA both as 
second and third line treatment. Overall, a dose-increase to 30 mg seems to confer only marginal 
incremental effect. The CHMP was of the opinion that both the combination with MTX and monotherapy 
≥ second line are considered supported by the data submitted.  From an efficacy-point-of view, the 
proposed indication and the proposed posology (15 mg once daily) was considered supported by the 
CHMP. However, from a safety perspective, the combination of Upadacitinib and other csDMARDs was 
considered not appropriate to conclude on an indication in combination with other csDMARDs. Hence, 
the Applicant withdrew this claim from the indication during the assessment (see Safety section). The 
revised indication is as follows: 
“RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate”. 
Among the key secondary endpoints were measures of physical function (HAQ-DI), CRP-independent 
outcomes based on CDAI and radiological outcomes. An effect was demonstrated also for these 
endpoints although the relatively short follow-up time may have some impact on the achieved 
radiographic results, taking in account that a great majority of subjects had no radiographic 
progression. For many outcomes, an effect was seen as early as week 1-2, indicating rapid onset of

effect. The current application includes a direct comparison with adalimumab which indicates that 
upadacitinib is non-inferior to adalimumab on efficacy endpoints. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
An integrated approach to safety assessment was undertaken by the Applicant, and subject data from 
the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were combined into 6 primary analysis sets across clinical studies. 
Each integrated analysis set was designed to assess the safety profile in a particular population or 
subset of subjects. Dose changes (for lack of efficacy or safety concerns) were only allowed in the 
Phase 2 LTE, and integrated data from the Phase 3 studies thus represents safety information without 
dose changes from the originally assigned upadacitinib dose. 
The integrated short-term controlled analysis sets, in which the exposure is generally limited to 
12-14 weeks, were (the respective abbreviations used for each dataset are indicated in bold and are 
followed by the number of subjects in the respective groups within the analysis set): 
• 
• 
Placebo-Controlled Upadacitinib 15 mg (Studies M13-549, M14-465, M13-542); PBO-controlled 
UPA 15; N = 1,042 PBO, N = 1,035 UPA 15 
Placebo-Controlled Upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg (Studies M13-549, M13-542); PBO-
controlled UPA 15/30; N = 390 PBO, N = 385 UPA 15, N = 384 UPA 30 
•  MTX-Controlled Upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg (Studies M13-545, M15-555); MTX-controlled 
UPA 15/30; N = 530 MTX/cMTX, N = 534 UPA 15, N = 529 UPA 30 
The integrated long-term analysis sets were: 
Any Phase 3 Upadacitinib 15 mg (all 5 Phase 3 studies); Any Ph3 UPA 15; N = 2,630 UPA 15 
•  Any Phase 3 Upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg (Studies M13-545, M13-549, M15-555, M13-542); 
Any Ph3 UPA 15/30; N = 1,213 UPA 15, N = 1,204 UPA 30 
•  Any RA Upadacitinib (global Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies combined); Any RA UPA; N = 4,443 
Patient exposure 
In the original submission, a total of 4,443 subjects received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib in the 
Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies, for a mean of 432.7 days. Of these subjects, 2,972 (66.9%) had exposure 
to upadacitinib for at least 48 weeks (Table 37). 
In the updated safety data submitted with the responses to the D120 LoQ (cut-off date 14 November 
2018), a total of 3,360 subjects had an exposure to upadacitinib for at least 48 weeks, giving a total 
exposure of 3,446 PY.

Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
In both short-term and long-term datasets, adverse events were most frequently reported in the 
Infectious and Infestations SOC; in the short-term PBO-controlled UPA 15 analysis set, frequencies in 
the upadacitinib 15 mg group were as follows: Infections and infestations (27.2%), Gastrointestinal 
disorders (10.9%), and Investigations (10.0%), while the most frequently affected SOCs in the 
placebo group were Infections and infestations (20.6%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (10.4%), and Gastrointestinal disorders (10.2%). Table 38 displays the most frequently 
reported short-term adverse events. In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, the most common 
AEs (≥ 10 E/100 PY) were upper respiratory tract infection (13.4 E/100 PY), nasopharyngitis (10.7 
E/100 PY), and urinary tract infection (10.1 E/100 PY). Similar to the short-term analyses, the most 
frequently affected SOCs were infections and infestations (91.6 E/100 PY), investigations (33.0 E/100 
PY), and gastrointestinal disorders (26.1 E/100 PY).

Adverse drug reactions for labelling 
The applicant performed an integrated analysis of the safety datasets to identify adverse events that 
should be considered adverse drug reactions for labelling purposes. Adverse events identified as 
adverse drug reactions based on the totality of evidence, together with their respective frequencies, 
are displayed in Table 39 together with their respective frequencies in the PBO-controlled UPA 15

Active/Latent TB 
Subjects were screened for TB infection at study entry in the upadacitinib RA studies and subjects with 
latent TB were allowed to enrol in the study after documented initiation or prior completion of 
prophylactic treatment.  Across the upadacitinib RA clinical studies, 6 cases of active TB were reported, 
of which 5 subjects were receiving upadacitinib (3 on upadacitinib 15 mg and 2 on upadacitinib 30 mg) 
and 1 subject was receiving adalimumab.  All but 1 subject was receiving concomitant csDMARDs 
and/or corticosteroids.  Of the 5 cases in subjects receiving upadacitinib, 3 were diagnosed with latent 
TB at screening and 2 manifested signs and symptoms of extra-pulmonary TB. 
In the Any RA UPA analysis set, which includes all global Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, the EAER of 
active/latent TB for all upadacitinib doses was 1.8 E/100 PY; 8 events (0.2 E/100 PY) of active/latent 
TB led to study discontinuation. 
Most of the events identified by the CMQ search were cases of latent TB diagnosed at the annual TB re-
testing in subjects with a negative TB test result at screening or most recent evaluation. There were 6 
cases of active TB; 5 subjects were receiving upadacitinib and 1 subject was receiving adalimumab. Of 
the 5 subjects receiving upadacitinib, 3 subjects were receiving 15 mg and 2 subjects were receiving 
30 mg at the time of the event.  Of the 5 cases of active TB reported in subjects receiving upadacitinib, 
3 had positive TB testing results at screening.  Of these 3 subjects with latent TB diagnosed at 
screening, 1 had isoniazid (INH) therapy for ≥ 6 months, and 2 subjects had INH therapy for < 6 
months (including 1 subject that was treated for 1 month). 
Herpes Zoster 
An increased risk of herpes zoster is observed in patients with underlying autoimmune diseases, such 
as RA, particularly due to the use of immunosuppressive therapies such as glucocorticoids, non-biologic 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, and TNF-alpha inhibitors. Furthermore, JAK inhibition has 
been associated with an increased risk of herpes zoster

In the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg short term analysis set (Studies M13-549, M13-542, M14-465), 
herpes zoster was reported in a higher percentage of subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg group

considerable variation in the demographics and other characteristics of the trial populations, the data 
shown serve as a benchmark for the rates in trials of moderately to severely active RA populations.

Incidence Rate of Malignancy Excluding NMSC in RA Phase 3 Clinical Programs (Long-
In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, there were 8 subjects with NMSC (EAER = 
0.3 E/100 PY). In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15/30 analysis set, the EAIR’s of NMSC were 
0.4 n/100 PY (5 subjects with NMSC) for upadacitinib 15 mg and 0.8 n/100 PY (11 subjects with 
NMSC) for 30 mg. When examined at 6 month periods from starting treatment, the incidence rates 
were consistently higher for 30 mg (Figure 25). In adalimumab-controlled analyses, the incidence rates 
of NMSC were comparable between upadacitinib 15 mg and adalimumab.

Figure 24. Treatment-Emergent NMSC Incidence Rate Per 100 PY by Onset of AE in 6 Month Interval – 
Long-Term All Exposure (Any Ph 3 UPA 15/30 Analysis Set) 
Although the numbers are small, a dose-related increase in the frequency of NMSC from upadacitinib 
15 mg to 30 mg cannot be excluded. Considering that the 30mg strength isn’t proposed in the 
posology, no information is included in the SmPC. 
Lymphoma is of special interest for the RA population which has a two-fold risk of lymphoma relative 
to the general population, with large RA cohort studies reporting standardized incidence rates between 
0.6 – 0.9/100 PY.  Across the global Upadacitinib Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, 4 subjects (< 0.1 n/100 
PY) with lymphoproliferative disorders were reported.  Additionally, there were 2 subjects in the Japan 
Study M14-663 reported with a lymphoproliferative disease (one subject with Hodgkin's Lymphoma 
and one subject with acute lymphocytic leukemia).  The types of lymphoma that were reported are, 
according to the applicant, consistent with lymphomas described in the RA population.  The applicant 
concludes that the overall incidence rate of lymphoma in the upadacitinib development program for RA 
was within the range expected for a population of patients with RA. 
Hepatic disorder 
Transaminase elevations have been reported with JAK inhibitors approved for the treatment of RA, 
including baricitinib and tofacitinib. Upadacitinib 15 mg was associated with a small (about 5 U/L) 
increase in mean ALT and AST levels in short-term analyses, and ALT increases of 5*ULN or greater 
were seen in about 1.5% of subjects compared to less than 0.5% of subjects on placebo. This small 
increase persisted on long-term treatment. Two subjects in the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set 
met biochemical criteria for Hy’s Law, but both subjects had alternative aetiologies (malignant 
melanoma, and concomitant use of INH). In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, the EAER of 
treatment-emergent hepatic disorders was 14.4 E/100 PY, most events being transaminase elevations. 
Elevations were usually asymptomatic and transient even in the setting of continued treatment; the 
EAER of hepatic disorders leading to study drug discontinuation was 0.8 E/100 PY. 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 134/201 
 
 
 
 
There was no evidence of a dose-related effect on hepatic enzymes. The increase was generally larger 
on upadacitinib than with either of the active comparators (adalimumab or MTX), but event rates of 
treatment-emergent hepatic disorders were generally comparable between the treatment groups. 
GI perforation 
GI perforations are a rare but serious event observed in patients with RA. Anti-IL-6 receptor therapy 
has been associated with an increased risk of GI perforation. In the Phase 3 upadacitinib RA studies, 
subjects with a history of GI perforation (other than appendicitis or penetrating injury), diverticulitis, or 
significantly increased risk for GI perforation per investigator judgment were excluded. 
In the Any RA UPA analysis set, 9 subjects experienced a total of 9 events (0.2 E/100 PY) identified by 
the GI Perforations SMQ search:  5 subjects continuously treated with upadacitinib 6 mg BID/15 mg 
QD and 4 subjects continuously treated with upadacitinib 12 mg BID/30 mg QD.  There were no events 
of GI perforation identified in subjects receiving placebo, MTX, or adalimumab in the other analysis 
sets.  
Based on sponsor medical review of the 5 events reported on upadacitinib 15 mg, 2 events were 
judged to represent GI perforation, both were serious; 1 event was a perforated appendix which 
occurred in the context of appendicitis and the other event was an anal fistula requiring surgical repair.  
The GI perforation EAER in the upadacitinib 15 mg group based on 2 events in 2655.1 PY (exposure in 
the Any Ph3 15 mg analysis set) was 0.075 E/100 PY. The applicant states that the EAER of GI 
perforation in the upadacitinib 15 mg group (0.075 E/100 PY) is within the range reported for other RA 
therapies. 
Based on sponsor medical review, all 4 reported events on upadacitinib 30 mg were judged to 
represent a GI perforation.  The subject with an event of intestinal perforation had vertebral fracture 
from a suspected neoplastic lesion in the dorsolumbar spine and developed paralytic ileus.  One 
subject with large intestine perforation had a prior history of diverticulosis and the event occurred 
during an episode of diverticulitis.  The other subject with an event of large intestine perforation had 
no relevant prior medical history but was receiving concomitant csDMARD therapy; the event was 
reported in the setting of acute kidney injury, haematemesis, ventricular tachycardia, and sepsis (no 
further event details available).  The event of peritonitis was judged likely due to a gastric ulcer 
perforation in a subject with a history of bleeding gastric ulcer.  All of these events were serious. 
Anaemia 
Anaemia is common in patients with active RA due to chronic inflammation. The resolution of 
inflammation has been associated with increases in haemoglobin values in patients receiving effective 
RA therapy.  As stated by the applicant, the impact of JAK inhibition on anaemia is complex, due to 
potential beneficial effects of reducing inflammation and countering effects of reducing EPO signalling 
through JAK2/homodimers.  Selective JAK1 inhibition was hypothesized to provide the potential to 
have an equivalent or greater impact on inflammation with a lesser impact on EPO signalling due to 
higher selectivity for JAK1 compared to JAK2 isoforms. 
The number and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant values for 
Haemoglobin in the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg analysis set (Studies M13-549, M14-465, M13-542) are 
shown in Table 51.

The applicant concludes that consistent with the JAK1 selectivity of upadacitinib, there was no 
meaningful difference in haemoglobin changes or TEAEs of anaemia in subjects receiving upadacitinib 
15 mg compared to placebo, adalimumab or MTX.  Haemoglobin decreases and TEAEs of anaemia were 
higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group compared to the upadacitinib 15 mg group.  Overall across all 
upadacitinib groups, the rates of SAEs of anaemia and subjects discontinuing upadacitinib due to 
anaemia were low. 
Neutropenia 
According to the applicant, most cases of neutropenia in patients with RA are related to medications 
including MTX and other immunosuppressants. Neutrophil decreases have been reported with JAK 
inhibitors. In particular, Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) is considered a concern in clinical 
practice due to an increased risk for infections. 
The number and percentage of subjects meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant neutrophil 
values in the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg analysis set (Studies M13-549, M14-465, M13-542) are shown 
in Table 52.

(Any Ph 3 UPA 15 mg Analysis Set; All5 Ph 3 Studies) 
The applicant concludes that decreases in neutrophil count are an identified ADR for upadacitinib.  
Neutrophil levels need to be considered for initiation, interruption and restarting of upadacitinib 
treatment. According to the applicant, no clear evidence of an association of serious infections, 
opportunistic infections or herpes zoster with a low neutrophil count was observed. 
Lymphopenia 
According to the applicant, lymphopenia is not uncommon in autoimmune diseases including RA. 
Genetic JAK deficiency is associated with lymphocyte count changes due to inhibition of the various 
cytokine signalling pathways and lymphocyte count decreases have been observed with clinical use of 
tofacitinib and baricitinib in RA patients.

According to the applicant, there was no SAE of lymphopenia in either upadacitinib group across the 
global Phase 2 and 3 studies. In Study M14-663 (Week 60 analysis set), 1 subject had a TEAE of 
lymphopenia that was considered serious, and developed pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia 5 days 
later.

CPK elevation 
According to the applicant, increases in CPK levels, mostly mild in severity, have been observed with 
other JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib and baricitinib). In the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg analysis set (Studies 
M13-549, M14-465, M13-542), a greater mean increase in CPK levels from baseline to Week 12 and a 
higher percentage of subjects with Grade ≥ 2 CPK increases was observed for subjects receiving 
upadacitinib 15 mg compared with placebo. 
Renal dysfynction 
In the short-term PBO-controlled UPA 15 analysis set, upadacitinib 15 mg was associated with a 6 - 
8% (3 - 4 umol/L) increase in serum creatinine concentration, but Grade 2 or higher increases (i.e. 
> 1.5 * ULN) were rare and occurred on both placebo and upadacitinib. TEAEs of renal dysfunction 
were reported in 1 subject (< 0.1%) in the upadacitinib 15 mg group and 2 subjects (0.2%) in the 
placebo group. In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, the initial increase was observed to 
plateau after the first 4-8 weeks of treatment. Through long-term exposure, 1 subject had Grade 3 
(> 3 * ULN) and 2 subjects had Grade 4 (> 6 * ULN) creatinine increases; the Grade 4 creatinine 
increases occurred at a single time point and normalised at following visits for both subjects. The EAER 
of renal dysfunction TEAEs was 0.4 E/100 PY, with a TEAE reported in 11 subjects. A small further 
increase in mean serum creatinine was seen with 30 mg vs. 15 mg, and mean increases on 15 mg 
were greater than on either adalimumab or MTX. 
In the long-term Any RA UPA analysis set, 3 subjects in the upadacitinib 6 mg BID/15 mg QD group, 
and 1 subject in the 12 mg BID/30 mg QD group had a Grade 3-4 increase in serum creatinine. The 
EAIR of a renal dysfunction TEAE was 0.4 n/100 PY for upadacitinib 6 mg BID/15 mg QD and 
Assessment report

1.0 n/100 PY for 12 mg BID/30 mg QD. There were a total of 9 subjects with a renal dysfunction SAE; 
these occurred in the context of acute infections.

Notes:  MACE events from Study M14-663 and from the placebo group in the Phase 2 studies are not 
included in this table. 
Events are presented by treatment at the time of the event. 
Of the 38 subjects (23 female and 15 male) on upadacitinib who experienced treatment-emergent 
MACE, the age range of the subjects was 42 to 83 years and 63% of them aged 60 years or older at 
study entry.  Time to event onset ranged from 16 to 1181 days on upadacitinib therapy.  All subjects 
had at least 1 CV risk factor in addition to the underlying RA.

Thirteen of the 38 subjects on upadacitinib (7 in the upadacitinib 6 mg BID/15 mg QD group and 6 in 
the upadacitinib 12 mg BID/30 QD mg group) experienced CV death.  Eleven of the 13 deaths occurred 
during the study period (treatment-emergent); 2 subjects experienced treatment-emergent MACE and 
died after the study as a consequence to the previous MACE event. 
Of the 13 subjects in the upadacitinib groups who died of MACE, 9 were aged ≥ 60 years and the other 
4 subjects aged 54 years or older.  Multiple CV risk factors were present in all 13 subjects, including a 
history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, smoking, MI, and other CV disorders, in 
addition to the existing medical condition of RA. 
The incidence rate for MACE for upadacitinib compared to other agent is provided in Figure 31. 
Note: 
EAIRs with long-term treatment in RA clinical trials that reported MACE are presented above.  The 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD EAIR is the treatment-emergent incidence rate from the Any Ph 3 UPA 15 mg 
analysis set.  Tofacitinib 5 mg data were based on all Phase 3 pooled 12 months exposure-adjusted data 
(cumulative long-term data was not available).  Although there may be considerable variation in the 
demographics and other characteristics of the trial populations, the data shown serve as a benchmark for 
the rates in trials of moderately to severely active RA populations.

•  One subject in Study M13-542; upadacitinib 15 mg:  experienced a PE on Day 436.  The 
subject had a history of obesity, diabetes and hypertension and the PE occurred after 
prolonged driving. 
•  One subject in study M13-538; upadacitinib 12 mg BID:  had a cardiac arrest on Day 897.  The 
CAC adjudicated this event as a VTE event of PE. 
Based on patients with RA having an increased risk for VTE and concerns raised for another JAK 
inhibitor product, the Applicant proposed that VTE is an important potential risk for upadacitinib. 
Vital signs and ECG 
In the PBO-controlled UPA 15 analysis set, mean changes in blood pressure were minimal in both 
groups, and the percentages of subjects meeting criteria for potentially clinically significant increases in 
systolic blood pressure (≥ 160 mmHg and ≥ 20 mmHg increase) and diastolic blood pressure 
(≥ 105 mmHg and ≥ 15 mmHg increase) were comparable between the upadacitinib group (3.6%, 
0.8%) and the placebo group (2.8%, 0.7%). In the long-term any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set, the 
percentage of subjects with potentially clinically significant increases was 5.4% for systolic blood 
pressure and 1.6% for diastolic blood pressure. The percentages of subjects who experienced 
potentially clinically significant increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar between 
the upadacitinib 15 mg and other comparators (MTX, adalimumab) across the various analysis data 
sets for both short-term treatment and long-term exposure. 
Based on an analysis of Phase 1 ECG data presented by the Applicant, the CHMP agreed in Scientific 
Advice that a thorough QT study would not be warranted; however the Applicant was advised to collect 
ECG safety data in the phase 3 development program. During the Phase 3 studies, ECG’s were 
performed at 48 week intervals and as clinically indicated. 
Overall, there were 34 adverse events captured with the broad Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation 
MedDRA SMQ. Of these, the majority of terms were “loss of consciousness” (4 events) and “syncope” 
(17 events). There were 4 nonserious events of “electrocardiogram QT prolonged” reported in 
2 subjects (1 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group and 1 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group). At baseline, 
ECG was reported as abnormal but there was no description of QTc prolongation in the 2 subjects. 
None of the events resulted in study drug discontinuation and no QT prolongation was reported in 
subsequent ECG measurements. In addition, the SMQ captured 3 reports of “cardiac arrest”, 2 reports 
of “ventricular tachycardia”, 1 event each of “cardiac death” and “sudden cardiac death”, and 2 events 
of “sudden cardiac death”. 
A total of 5 subjects were recorded with ECG QTcF prolongation in eCRFs based on the criteria (QT/QTc 
≥ 450 msec for female and ≥ 430 msec for male). All subjects had QTcF interval < 500 msec recorded 
during the course of study.

Notes:  The upadacitinib 15 mg QD rate is from Any Ph 3 UPA 15 mg analysis set.  
For the event of death, the EAER and the EAIR are the same.  Incidence rates of death from various RA 
clinical trials are presented in the above graphics (Tofacitinib 5 mg = Tofacitinib 5 mg BID.  Baricitinib 2 
mg or 4 mg = Baricitinib 2 mg QD or 4 mg QD).  All death rates are based on exposure adjusted long term 
data.  Although there may be considerable variation in the composition of trial population with regard to 
demographic and other characteristics that may have an impact on incidence rates, this is a benchmark of 
mortality rates from trials of moderately to severely RA population.

Serious adverse events 
In the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg short term analysis set (Studies M13-549, M14-465, M13-542), the 
percentage of subjects with SAEs was higher in the upadacitinib 15 mg group (3.4%) compared with 
the placebo group (1.8%). The majority of SAEs were reported in 1 subject each in any group, except 
for appendicitis, gastroenteritis, viral infection, and wrist fracture which were each reported in 2 
subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and gastroenteritis that 
were reported in 2 subjects and 3 subjects in the placebo group, respectively. 
In the integrated PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg and 30 mg short term analysis set (Studies M13-549, 
M13-542), the percentages of subjects with SAEs were in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups 
4.7% and 4.9%, respectively, both of which were higher than the placebo group; 1.3%. The majority 
of SAEs were reported in 1 subject each in the groups, except for wrist fracture (2 subjects in the 15 
mg group) and pneumonia and prostate cancer (each reported in 2 subjects in the upadacitinib 30 mg 
group). 
In the long-term Any Ph 3 UPA 15 and 30 mg analysis set (Studies M13-545, M13-549, M15-555, M13-
542), the EAERs of SAEs were 16.9 E/100 PY and 21.3 E/100 PY for the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg 
groups, respectively.  The SAE with the highest EAER in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 groups was 
pneumonia (0.9 E/100 PY and 1.7 E/100 PY, respectively).

Laboratory findings 
Lipids 
In the upadacitinib development program, approximately 29% of subjects had elevated LDL cholesterol 
(LDL-C) (≥ 3.36 mmol/L) and 58% had lower HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (≤ 1.55 mmol/L) at baseline. 
In the short-term PBO-controlled UPA 15 analysis set, upadacitinib induced a rapid and persistent 
increase in lipids; mean increases from baseline to Week 12 were approximately 13% for total 
cholesterol (TC), HDL-C and LDL-C, and approximately 10% for triglycerides, whereas the levels 
remained quite stable in the placebo group. Shift analyses for TC demonstrated 10.4% of subjects on 
upadacitinib 15 mg vs. 2.0% of subjects on placebo shifting from a baseline value of < 5.17 mmol/L 
(desirable) to a maximum value ≥ 6.21 mmol/L (high); similarly, for LDL-C, 8.5% of subjects on 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 1.7% of subjects on placebo shifted from a baseline LDL-C value of 
< 3.36 mmol/L (optimal or near optimal) to a maximum value of ≥ 4.14 mmol/L (high or very high). 
With all lipids being similarly affected, there was no detrimental net effect on LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. 
The elevated levels of HDL-C and LDL-C were persistent on long-term treatment; with all lipids being 
similarly affected, the TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios only increased by less than 5% on long term 
exposure. 
In the PBO-controlled UPA 15/30 analysis set, there was a small incremental increase in lipids from 
upadacitinib 15 mg to 30 mg. Mean changes in lipid parameters from baseline to Week 12 for placebo, 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 groups were: TC: -0.036, 0.652, 0.765 mmol/L; HDL-C: 0.010, 0.252, 
0.233 mmol/L; LDL-C: -0.035, 0.353, 0.444 mmol/L; and triglycerides: -0.020, 0.127, 0.163 mmol/L. 
Corresponding mean changes from baseline to Week 12 in lipid ratios for placebo, upadacitinib 15 mg 
and 30 mg groups were: TC/HDL-C: -0.046, -0.078, 0.040; LDL-C/HDL-C: -0.040, -0.078, 0.037. The 
same overall pattern, i.e. a small incremental effect with upadacitinib 30 mg over 15 mg, prevailed on 
long term exposure. 
An alternative “atherogenic index”, the apolipoprotein ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, was also evaluated in Studies 
M13-549 and M13-542; ApoB is considered an atherogenic indicator and ApoA1 an anti-atherogenic 
indicator. Compared to placebo, small increases in both ApoB and ApoA1 were seen with both 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg. However, the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio slightly decreased from baseline to 
Week 12 in all groups. 
In adalimumab-controlled analyses, the increases in lipids were consistently greater with upadacitinib 
15 mg than placebo or adalimumab; from baseline to Week 12, mean lipid changes in the placebo, 
adalimumab and upadacitinib 15 mg groups were: TC: -0.037, 0.160, 0.666 mmol/L; HDL-C: 0.017, 
0.032, 0.187 mmol/L; LDL-C: –0.025, 0.079, 0.400 mmol/L; and triglycerides: -0.061, 0.106, 
0.168 mmol/L. At Week 12, the mean ratios of LDL-C/HDL-C were 2.049, 1.986 and 2.043 for placebo, 
adalimumab and upadacitinib 15 mg, respectively. 
Similarly, in MTX-controlled analyses, the increases in lipids were consistently greater with both 
upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg compared to MTX; from baseline to Week 12/14, mean lipid changes for 
the MTX, upadacitinib 15 mg, and upadacitinib 30 mg groups were: TC: 0.054, 0.729, 0.894 mmol/L; 
HDL-C: 0.021, 0.264, 0.270 mmol/L; LDL-C: 0.029, 0.403, 0.507 mmol/L; and triglycerides: –0.015, 
0.149, 0.268 mmol/L. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratios remained comparable at 2.063, 1.986 and 2.073 for 
MTX, upadacitinib 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg, respectively. 
Approximately 11% of subjects in the Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set reported statin use at baseline. 
According to the Applicant, subjects with statin use showed a trend toward smaller mean increases in 
TC and LDL-C while having no discernible change in HDL cholesterol. Comparing subjects with statin 
Assessment report

Page 157/201 
 
 
 
use versus without statin use at baseline, the mean changes from baseline to Week 12 for the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group were: TC: 0.537 vs 0.681 mmol/L; HDL-C: 0.176 vs 0.207 mmol/L; LDL-C: 
0.286 vs 0.398 mmol/L. 
In addition, during placebo-controlled periods in the Phase 3 studies, 9 subjects initiated statin 
treatment post-baseline in the upadacitinib 15 mg group and 5 in the placebo group. Although the data 
are based on a small sample size, after statin treatment there was a trend for reduction in LDL-C 
returning to its baseline levels. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
According to the applicant, in all short-term analysis sets, the percentages of subjects with TEAEs, 
SAEs, severe TEAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were generally comparable across age groups. 
In the long-term analysis sets, subjects ≥ 75 years of age in the upadacitinib 30 mg groups 
experienced increased rates of overall infections compared to subjects < 75 years of age. 
Pregnancy 
In the upadacitinib clinical development program, lactating and pregnant females were excluded from 
the studies and all female subjects of childbearing potential were required to use protocol-specified 
pregnancy avoidance measures.  Study drug was immediately discontinued in any female subject 
found to be pregnant during the clinical trials. 
The pregnancy outcomes of the 16 subjects exposed to upadacitinib during pregnancy are as follows:  
4 live births without congenital anomaly, 2 elective terminations (no foetal defects or unknown), 6 
spontaneous abortions, 3 ongoing pregnancies and 1 lost to follow-up.  All 6 subjects of spontaneous 
abortion were either taking MTX concomitantly or used MTX within 1 month prior to conception. All 
subjects were exposed to upadacitinib at the time of conception and during the first trimester of 
pregnancy.  All 4 live births were without congenital anomalies; 3 subjects gave birth to full term 
infants without complications and 1 subject gave birth to a 28 week premature infant without reported 
complications.  In the 4 pregnancies resulting in live births, the women were exposed to upadacitinib 
through approximately 4 – 8 weeks gestation.  According to the applicant, no relevant maternal 
medical problems or complications during pregnancy, delivery or postpartum period were reported. 
Four paternal exposure pregnancies have been reported in the partner of a male study subject in the 
upadacitinib clinical development program (1 in a RA study and 3 in a CD study). The two cases with 
known outcome resulted in live birth without congenital anomaly and spontaneous abortion. 
Concomitant DMARDs 
The drug interaction potential of upadacitinib with MTX was evaluated in a Phase 1 study which, 
according to the applicant,  demonstrated that concomitant administration of upadacitinib and MTX had 
no effect on either upadacitinib or MTX plasma exposures. 
A subgroup analysis of subjects in the placebo-controlled upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD 
analysis set who were on background MTX and those who were on background csDMARDs other than 
MTX was performed.  The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs was summarized by 
csDMARD use (any MTX [with/without other csDMARD], other csDMARD without MTX, any sulfasalazine 
without MTX, any hydroxychloroquine without MTX, and any leflunomide without MTX) for the 
PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg and 30 mg analysis set (Studies M13-549, M13-542). 
Assessment report

Page 158/201 
 
 
 
According to the applicant, there was no clear pattern with respect to csDMARD use for any category of 
TEAE, including overall TEAEs, SAEs, severe TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (Table 76), 
as well as the types of TEAEs by csDMARD use (Table 77).

At the CHMP’s request, the applicant submitted updated data. Across the five Phase 3 RA studies, 122 
subjects received upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose in combination with non-MTX-csDMARDs and 1854 
subjects received upadacitinib 15 mg QD dose in combination with MTX alone.  The safety data for 
these subjects are presented in Table 78 and Table 79.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for drug-drug interactions between upadacitinib and commonly used concomitant 
medications as well as probe substrates for CYP450 enzymes was characterized in several Phase 1 
studies.  The applicant states that based on the results of these studies, strong inducers of CYP3A 
(e.g., rifampin) reduce upadacitinib plasma exposures by approximately half.  Strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(e.g., ketoconazole) increase upadacitinib AUC by 75% and maximum observed concentration (Cmax) 
by 70%.  Concomitant administration of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, OATP1B inhibitors, MTX, pH 
modifying medications, or statins has no effect on upadacitinib plasma exposures.  Upadacitinib has no 
clinically relevant effects on plasma exposures of MTX, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel, statins, or 
drugs that are substrates for metabolism by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP3A.

At the CHMP’s request, the applicant confirmed that no observations of potential interactions have 
been reported in the clinical program.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the PBO-controlled UPA 15 mg analysis set (Studies M13-549, M14-465, M13-542), the percentage 
of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was 2.8% in upadacitinib 15 mg and 
2.0% in the placebo group. The majority of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 
reported in 1 subject each in any group, except for anemia, vertigo, bronchitis, ALT increased, blood 
creatinine increased, and headache each reported in 2 subjects, and AST increased reported in 3 
subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; PJP and worsening rheumatoid arthritis were reported in 2 
subjects each in the placebo group. 
In the integrated MTX-controlled analysis set (Studies M13-545, M15-555) at 3 months, the 
percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug was as follows: upadacitinib 
30 mg (2.6%), upadacitinib 15 mg (3.4%) and MTX (2.6%). The majority of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported in 1 subject each in the groups, except for ALT increased reported in 2 
subjects each in all groups, and worsening rheumatoid arthritis reported in 2 subjects in the MTX 
group. 
When compared to adalimumab, the percentage of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study drug was 4.9% in the adalimumab group and 2.8% in the upadacitinib 15 mg group after 14 
weeks. 
In the long-term Any Phase 3 UPA 15 mg and 30 mg analysis set (Studies M13-549, M13-542, M13-
545, M15-555), the EAERs of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 9.4 E/100 PY and 
13.3 E/100 PY for the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 mg groups, respectively.  The TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of study drug with the highest EAER in the upadacitinib 15 mg and 30 groups was 
pneumonia (0.5 E/100 PY and 0.9 E/100 PY, respectively). 
Post marketing experience 
Upadacitinib has not yet been approved for marketing in any country. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Summary of the data 
Known risks with JAK inhibitors are neutropenia, infections (especially herpes zoster), lipid disorders, 
hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms and perforation and elevated muscle enzymes. There has 
been concern on an increased risk for malignancies and cardiovascular events, and long-term studies 
are ongoing. In addition, an Article 20 referral is currently on-going for Xeljanz (tofacitinib) assessing 
the risk of thrombotic events, in particular PE and VTE, on the benefit / risk profile of the medicine.  
In the upadacitinib phase 2 and 3 studies, a total of 4,443 subjects received at least 1 dose of 
upadacitinib for a mean of 432.7 days. Of these subjects, 2,972 (66.9%) had exposure to upadacitinib 
for at least 48 weeks. Five pivotal phase 3 studies have been performed; two in which upadacitinib has 
been studied in monotherapy and compared against MTX (M13-545 [MTX-naïve subjects] - and M15-
555 [MTX-failures], pooled into “MTX-controlled” dataset), and three in which upadacitinib has been 
studied as add-on to MTX or other csDMARDs and compared against monotherapy with MTX or other 
csDMARDs (M13-549, M14-465 and M13-542, pooled into “placebo-controlled”). It should be noted 
that “placebo” refers to background therapy with MTX or other csDMARDs, and that no true placebo

arm exists. Study M14-465 included both an arm with MTX in monotherapy and an arm with active 
comparator, adalimumab (also on top of MTX). Two doses were, 15 mg and 30 mg.  
Infectious disorders were the most commonly reported adverse events. Most infections were upper 
respiratory tract infections and non-serious in nature; however, susceptibility to serious infections was 
also increased. Typical laboratory observations included increases in CPK, cholesterol, creatinine and 
hepatic enzymes, and a decrease in neutrophil count. With the recommended 15 mg QD dosage, there 
was little effect on haemoglobin. These observed changes in laboratory parameters have been 
evaluated in parallel with clinical events that could potentially be associated with the corresponding 
changes. 
The overall size of the safety database (4,443 subjects exposed in the Any RA UPA analysis set, with 
3,360 subjects exposed for 48 weeks or more) was considered sufficient to the CHMP to enable 
appropriate characterisation of the general safety profile.  
The cut-off for data provided for original assessment has occurred at various times in early to mid-
2018. At the CHMP’s request, updated data up to Nov 2018 were presented in which no new significant 
safety signals arose. Long term safety is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk 
minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 
2.7). 
The applicant has summarised the safety data into a number of datasets: 
• 
• 
For monotherapy, the following analysis set is relevant: “MTX-controlled Upadacitinib 15 mg 
and 30 mg” (studies M13-545 and M15-555). Study M13-545 included MTX-naïve subjects, 
whereas M15-555 included subjects previously treated with MTX.  
For combination therapy, the following analysis set is relevant: Placebo-controlled Upadacitinib 
15 mg (studies M13-542, M13-549, M14-465).  
In general, the integrated approach to safety analysis that the Applicant has used is considered 
relevant. At the CHMP’s request, the Applicant submitted summaries of overall adverse event rates as 
well as rates of events of special interest for subpopulations at different stages of the disease. The 
CHMP concluded that the overall safety profile of upadacitinib is quite consistent across the 
subpopulations at different stages of the disease. 
Placebo (which in MTX-failures equals to continuing MTX) is not an alternative treatment in this 
population with an active disease, and thus the risk must be compared to the other alternative 
treatments. Subjects eligible for upadacitinib are csDMARD-experienced and for these subjects the 
alternative to treatment with upadacitinib is other JAK inhibitors or biologics. Therefore, the 
comparison to adalimumab is of high relevance. Study M14-465 includes a direct comparison to 
adalimumab.  
In summary, the frequency of adverse events during the first 3 months was 49.6% when upadacitinib 
was given in monotherapy (compared to 48.3% for MTX), and 56% when upadacitinib was given in 
combination with other csDMARDs (vs 48.4% for placebo+csDMARD, and 48.3% for 
adalimumab+MTX). The frequency of SAEs was 3.0 % for upadacitinib in monotherapy (vs 2.3% for 
MTX) and 3.4% when upadacitinib was given in combination with other csDMARDs (vs 1.8 % for 
placebo+csDMARDs and 2.4% for adalimumab+MTX). These data support the use of upadacitinib as 
second-line treatment, after failing on MTX.  
A dose-dependent relationship was seen when comparing 15 and 30 mg upadacitinib, supporting the 
use of the lower dose of 15 mg.

Page 163/201 
 
 
 
When upadacitinib 15 mg was compared to adalimumab (both in combination with MTX), most adverse 
events (for example serious infections, hepatic disorder, neutropenia, lymphopenia, herpes zoster, CPK 
elevation) occurred more frequently for upadacitinib than for adalimumab, although the differences are 
small. The frequencies of SAEs and severe AEs were comparable between the arms. Although the lack 
of long-term safety studies for upadacitinib is acknowledged, those data support the proposed second 
line indication. 
In CHMP Scientific Advice, the applicant was advised to document the reversibility of any adverse 
effects to manage risks. For most of the assessed laboratory parameters, reversibility is seen 
regardless of continuation or discontinuation of upadacitinib treatment, the only exception being 
haemoglobin, for which there is no data on reversibility upon continued treatment (this could be due to 
protocol-mandated interruption of study drug in subjects with decreased haemoglobin). There is no 
evidence of progressive deterioration in the laboratory parameters assessed. The guidance for 
monitoring and treatment interruption/discontinuation is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Deaths 
A summary of the respective phase 3 studies is provided below and followed by the pooled data.  
In study M13-545 (first line, monotherapy) up to week 24, there were 2 cases of deaths (0.6%) in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group compared to 1 (0.3%) in the placebo group. The first death in the UPA 15 
mg group had a prior history of malignant melanoma and died due to metastatic malignant melanoma 
and tumor infiltration of the hepatic vein, after a treatment period of 111 days. An association with 
upadacitinib is possible. The other case was a subject who died from a myocardial infarction on day 29 
of treatment.  
In the upadacitinib 30 mg group, the following causes of death were noted: pneumonia/sepsis, sudden 
death and peritonitis. In the MTX-group, a subject with type 2 DM and hypertension died due to acute 
myocardial infarction.  
In long-term all study drug exposure analysis (to week 48 and beyond) in the same study, EAERs of 
death (including treatment-emergent and nontreatment-emergent) for the upadacitinib 15 mg 
monotherapy, upadacitinib 30 mg monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups were 1.2 E/100 PY, 
2.1 E/100 PY, and 0.3 E/100 PY, respectively. The mortality rate is numerically higher for UPA 15 mg 
monotherapy in study M13-545 including MTX-naïve subjects (IR 1.2E/100PY) than in the pooled data 
(IR 0.5E/100PY). At the CHMP’s request, the applicant presented comparative data through week 48 
(i.e. up to the end of the active controlled study period) on the number of deaths that occurred in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg arm and the MTX arm respectively. The CHMP concluded that no specific pattern 
could be observed and the difference observed is likely due to the small sample size.  
In study M13-549 (≥ second line, csDMARD add-on), there were no deaths up to week 12. Data 
beyond week 12 was not included in the CSR, but is summarised in the pooled data below. 
In study M14-465 (≥ second line, MTX add-on), there were no deaths in the upadacitinib 15 mg group 
compared to 2 deaths in the adalimumab group and 2 deaths in the placebo (=MTX) group up to week 
26.  In the long-term extension (week 48 and beyond), there were 4 TEAEs leading to death in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group (1.1 E/100PY) compared to 2 cases in the adalimumab group (1.5E/100PY). 
Also in the updated safety data presented in response to the day 120 LoQ, the mortality was lower for 
upadacitinib 15 mg (9 deaths or 0.6 E/100PY for upadacitinib vs 5 deaths or 0.9 E/100PY for 
adalimumab, this includes also non treatment-emergent deaths). 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 164/201 
 
 
 
Taken together, data up to 48 weeks from the clinically highly relevant study M14-465 (including a 
direct comparison with adalimumab) comparative data do not indicate an increased mortality for 
upadacitinib compared to adalimumab.  
In study M15-555 (second line, monotherapy) up week 14, there was one case of death in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg group (0.5%) vs no case in the MTX group. This was a subject who was a former 
smoker and with concurrent hypertension, who died on day 39 from a ruptured aneurysm leading to a 
haemorrhagic stroke. No controlled, long term data were available for this study. 
In study M13-542 (third line, csDMARD add-on), there was one death among upadacitinib 15 mg-
treated subjects up to week 24 (IR1.1), compared to 0 cases in the placebo (=csDMARDs) group. This 
was a subject with a history of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidaemia and hypertension who died from a 
cardiac arrest at day 163. The subject had multiple risk factors, and causality with upadacitinib cannot 
be considered established. No controlled, long term data were available for this study. 
In the pooled data from all phase 3 studies (M13-545, M13-549, M14-465, M15-555, M13-542) up to 3 
months , the IR for death appeared comparable for the upadacitinib 15 mg, MTX (from M13-545 and 
M15-555 where MTX was the comparator), placebo (= MTX or csDMARDs, from the studies where all 
subjects received background treatment) and adalimumab. The CHMP noted that the lowest figure was 
actually seen for upadacitinib 15 mg although the comparison is hampered by the small exposure and 
low number of absolute events in the different arms.  
In the pooled long-term data from all phase 3 studies (48 weeks and beyond), there were 14 deaths in 
upadacitinib 15 mg treated subjects. Among these cases, the majority were cardiovascular deaths. The 
CHMP considered that 9 of the 14 cases were cardiovascular. It is noted that there were no deaths due 
to infections among upadacitinib-treated subjects. 
Also in the long-term analysis set, the calculated mortality rates appear similar for upadacitinib and the 
comparators. The rate for upadacitinib 15 mg was numerically higher than for MTX but lower than for 
adalimumab but the comparison is hampered by relatively low exposure and absolute number of 
events (in the comparator arms). 
The CHMP concluded based on the pooled data that the mortality rates did not substantially differ 
according to the treatments received in this population with active, potentially debilitating 
inflammatory disease in which underlying risk factors for both CV death and infections are expected to 
be frequent.  
The applicant provided mortality-figures for the two other approved JAK-inhibitors based on EPAR data.  
Fully acknowledging the limitations of inter-study comparisons, the CHMP considered that the observed 
numbers of deaths (tofacitinib IR=0.36, baricitinib IR=0.44 and upadacitinib 15 mg IR 0.5E/100PY) 
were roughly comparable between the three drugs.  
Among all upadacitinib-treated subjects (both 15 and 30 mg), the following causes of death were 
noted:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrest, myocardial 
infarction, cardiac failure, haemorrhagic stroke, sudden cardiac death, metastatic rectal cancer, 
infections (including meningitis), peritonitis, lung adenocarcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, metastatic 
malignant melanoma (removed several years ago), adenocarcinoma of colon, and congestive 
cardiomyopathy. Thus, in many cases, the causes of death were cardiovascular, in some cases the 
reasons were infections or malignancies. 
Serious infections 
In short-term analysis (3 months), the frequency of serious infections was 0.6% for upadacitinib 15 
mg in monotherapy (vs 0.4% for MTX), 1.2% for upadacitinib in combination with other csDMARDs (vs 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 165/201 
 
 
 
0.6% for placebo+csDMARDs and 1.2% for adalimumab+MTX). When compared to adalimumab during 
long-term exposure, the risk for serious infections was numerically lower for upadacitinib (IR 4.1) than 
for adalimumab (IR 4.3).  
During long-term exposure (48 weeks), the incidence rate of serious infections was numerically lower 
for UPA 15 mg than for UPA 30 mg. The risk of serious infection clearly seems to be dose-related, as 
evidenced by consistently higher event rates with the 30 mg dose.  
Fully acknowledging the limitations of inter-study comparisons, the incidence rate is slightly higher for 
upadacitinib 15 mg (IR 3.84) than for the JAK-inhibitors Olumiant (from EPAR: overall serious infection 
IR 3.2/100 PY) and Xeljanz (from EPAR: 2.71/100PY for 5 mg BID in RCTs).  
Serious infections are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC, and a list of infections are summarised in 
4.8 of the SmPC. At the CHMP’s request the applicant has also included specific information on 
tuberculosis and meningitis in the Section 4.4 of the SmPC. In addition, Upadacitinib is contraindicated 
in patients with active severe infections. Serious infections including TB is listed as a safety concern in 
the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in 
included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Opportunistic infections 
There were no reported opportunistic infections for upadacitinib in monotherapy (up to 3 months). 
When upadacitinib was given in combination with other csDMARDs, the frequency of opportunistic 
infections was 0.5% for upadacitinib vs 0.3% for placebo+csDMARDs. The IR for UPA 15 mg is 
comparable to the IR for adalimumab (IR for upadacitinib = 1.4, IR for adalimumab=1.5 in study M14-
465). The most common opportunistic infection for both doses of upadacitinib was oral candidiasis. For 
more severe opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, there were 4 cases in 
the Japanese study M14-663, but no cases among upadacitinib-treated subjects in the global studies. 
There were no deaths due to an opportunistic infection in subjects receiving upadacitinib in the RA 
clinical development program. A detailed description of opportunistic infections is included in the SmPC 
section 4.8. Opportunistic infections is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk 
minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 
2.7). 
Herpes zoster 
The frequency of herpes zoster was over 2 times higher in subjects receiving upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, and event rates were increased as compared to either MTX or adalimumab. The finding is 
consistent with the EPAR of other JAK inhibitors and thus clearly indicative of a class effect. The 
majority of events involved a single dermatome; development of post-herpetic neuralgia was reported 
in about 5% of cases. The applicant stated that a prior history of herpes zoster was identified as a 
significant risk factor for developing a herpes zoster event; furthermore, herpes zoster was more 
frequent in Asia than elsewhere. 
The SmPC includes recommendations for precautionary measures, including prophylactic zoster 
vaccination, and the risk of herpes zoster is described in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. Herpes 
zoster is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7).

Tuberculosis 
There were 5 cases of active TB infection among upadacitinib-treated subjects. Of these, 3 had a latent 
TB at screening whereof 1 received isoniazid therapy for ≥ 6 months. This case is important, implying 
a residual risk for active TB although screening is performed and prophylactic treatment is given.  
The IR of 1.8 E/100 PY seems rather high when compared to the other JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib all 
doses 0.19E/100 PY, baricitinib 4 mg 0.2E/100PY according to the respective EPARs). As recommended 
in Section 4.4 of the SmPC, patients should be screened for latent TB before starting upadacitinib 
treatment. In addition, Upadacitinib is contraindicated in patients with active TB infections. Serious 
infections including TB is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation 
measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Malignancy 
Subjects with a history of any malignancy except for successfully treated NMSC or localized carcinoma 
in situ of the cervix were excluded from the phase 3 studies. The long-term exposure for upadacitinib 
is currently limited; 520 subjects have been exposed for at least 96 weeks. The cancers observed 
during the current observation period are dominated by skin and breast cancer. The risk will have to be 
carefully followed post-approval. At the CHMP’s request, an adequate warning has been included in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Malignancy is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk 
minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 
2.7). 
Hepatic disorder 
In short-term analysis up to 3 months, liver transaminase elevations were more common when 
upadacitinib was given in combination with other csDMARDs (proportion of subjects with ALT ≥ 3 × 
ULN: 2.1% in the upadacitinib group compared to 1.5% for placebo) than in monotherapy (1.7%), 
which is expected since most csDMARDs can affects the liver function. Transaminase elevations were 
less frequent for upadacitinib in monotherapy (1.7%) than for MTX (3.6%). This ADR is described in 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request.  
However, most events were asymptomatic and transient even in the setting of continued use of 
upadacitinib and there is currently no evidence of actual hepatotoxicity. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) were excluded from the phase 3 studies. As 
severe hepatic impairment is expected to lead to an increased exposure of upadacitinib, and 
considering the less favourable safety profile observed with the 30 mg dose, the CHMP requested 
upadacitinib to be contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh C.  
Use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, DILI, use in patients with evidence of untreated 
chronic infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate 
risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see 
Section 2.7). 
GI perforation 
The observed frequency of gastrointestinal perforations was not higher among upadacitinib-treated 
subjects than frequency observed in a background population. 
GI perforation is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / 
additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7).

Anemia 
Overall, there was very little effect on mean haemoglobin with the 15 mg dosage of upadacitinib, and 
according to the Applicant, Grade 3 and even Grade 4 decreases were in most cases transient and 
recovered without study drug discontinuation. However, the 30 mg dosage did induce a more 
observable decrease in haemoglobin, and Grade 3 and 4 decreases were more common on 30 mg than 
15 mg. 
Monitoring guidelines and instructions on potential treatment interruptions in case of haematological 
abnormalities are provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Neutropenia 
During the first 3 months, the frequency of neutropenia (<1.5x109/L) was 4% in the upadacitinib 15 
mg group vs 0.6% in the csDMARD group. Upadacitinib is associated with a consistent and persistent 
decrease, averaging about 15% with 15 mg, in neutrophil counts. Whereas the temporal association of 
decreased neutrophil counts with the increased propensity is not straight-forward and the overall 
numbers are not sufficient for any robust association analysis, the fundamental concern of neutropenia 
being associated with an increased susceptibility to infections cannot be excluded. 
There was a higher proportion of subjects in the UPA 15 and 30 mg groups experiencing neutropenia 
than in the placebo group.  
Neutropenia is therefore listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Dosing recommendations in case of 
neutropenia are also provided in Section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Lymphopenia 
There were no differences in lymphocyte count between UPA 15 mg and placebo during the short-term 
placebo-controlled period of the studies. Administration of upadacitinib was associated with an increase 
in mean ALC over the first 36 weeks of starting treatment, followed by slight decreases afterwards. No 
clinically relevant decrease from baseline was observed. 
Although there were no SAEs of lymphopenia in the global studies, in the Japanese study M14-663 
there was 1 subject with a TEAE of lymphopenia who developed pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia 5 
days later. 
Monitoring guidelines and instructions on potential treatment interruptions are included in sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
CPK elevation 
CPK elevations were observed for a higher proportion of UPA15- and UPA30mg-treated subjects than 
for subjects treated with placebo (the majority with a mild increase of >2.5-5 x ULN). There seemed to 
be a dose-dependency. This ADR is described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Renal dysfunction 
Upadacitinib was associated with a consistent increase in serum creatinine, averaging about 10% at 
the 15 mg dose. The rate of serious adverse events, severe adverse events and adverse events leading 
to discontinuation is increased in patients with mild renal impairment compared to patients with normal 
renal function, and the rates are increased even further in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Increased rates are also seen in corresponding placebo groups. While exposure-response analyses may 
not suggest an increased risk of serious infections, a substantially higher risk of serious infections in 
Assessment report

Page 168/201 
 
 
 
subjects on upadacitinib 30 mg than 15 mg was clinically observed. Further safety information from 
the moderate renal impairment group is required post approval.  
At CHMP’s request, Section 4.2 of the SmPC includes precautionary message regarding severely renal 
impaired patients. Use in patients with severe renal impairment is listed as a safety concern in the RMP 
and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in 
the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Lipids 
Upadacitinib induced rapidly developing and persistent increases averaging 10-15% across all lipid 
classes. However, the effect being equal across total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, atherogenic 
indices based on cholesterol (TC/HDL-C; LDL-C/HDL-C) and major apolipoproteins (i.e. ApoB/ApoA1) 
remained essentially unchanged. The increases did not seem to be associated with adverse clinical 
consequences (e.g. MACE). 
The very limited available evidence supports the notion of these increases being statin-responsive. 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC adequately reflect the risks and provide monitoring guidance. 
MACE is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Effect on body weight 
Long-term treatment with upadacitinib was frequently associated with an increase in body weight, but 
weight changes have only been characterised with a single threshold of >7% change from baseline. 
While weight increase may be a sign of improved disease control, a large proportion of subjects had a 
high body mass index already at baseline (>30% of subjects had a BMI exceeding 30 kg/m^2 in the 
Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set), and a further increase body weight could have adverse consequences in 
such patients. Weight increased is listed as an ADR in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
 Age, BMI, other intrinsic factors 
Analysis by age group is limited by the small number of patients > 75 years of age in the program (N 
= 78 in the Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set). There was an increased frequency of adverse event in the 
elderly group notably infections. At the CHMP’s request, the Section 4.4 of the SmPC was updated to 
include a precautionary statement for this population. Use in very elderly (≥ 75 years of age) is listed 
as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
A high baseline body weight or BMI was associated with an increased frequency of serious and severe 
adverse events as well as events leading to discontinuation. This likely reflects the underlying 
characteristics of this patient group, but should be considered in the context of a potential weight 
increase being associated with upadacitinib. See paragraph above. 
MACE and Other Cardiovascular Events 
There were 13 cases of cardiovascular death among upadacitinib-treated subjects; 7 on upadacitinib 
15 mg and 6 on upadacitinib 30 mg. All of these cases had cardiovascular risk factors (such as 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidaemia or obesity).  
In the long-term exposure analysis of all phase 3 studies (data up to week 48 and beyond), the 
estimate for the exposure-adjusted IR for MACE is similar for MTX (2 events/314 PY, IR=0.6) and 
upadacitinib 15 mg (16 events/2651 PY, IR=0.6) but numerically lower for adalimumab (2 events/468 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 169/201 
 
 
 
PY, IR=0.4). This analysis did not include the comparison with placebo, the reasoning probably being 
that there is limited phase 3 study placebo exposure beyond 14 weeks, only study M14-465 included 
26 weeks placebo exposure but this study included opportunities for switch to upadacitinib at week 
14,18 and 22 for subjects with poor improvement (see efficacy section of this AR for details) and a 
final switch to upadacitinib at week 26 for all placebo subjects regardless of response, which 
complicates the interpretation of data. However, two phase 3 studies included active controlled safety 
data up to week 48; study M13-545 that included a 48 week-comparison with MTX and study M14-465 
that included a week 48-comparison with adalimumab. Placebo is not a realistic alternative treatment 
option in the proposed target population with an active and potentially debilitating disease, not 
responding to first line RA treatment. Consequently, the direct comparison with adalimumab in study 
M14-465, is considered to be of most relevance although the direct comparison with MTX in study 
M13-545 is also of interest to further characterize the magnitude of risk for MACE. 
When looking specifically at study M14-465, up to week 26 (Censored at Treatment Switching), there 
were 3 cases in the PBO arm (1.2/100 PY, 2 cases in the adalimumab arm (1.5/100 PY) and no cases 
in the upadacitinib 15 mg arm). At long-term exposure (48 weeks and beyond), the IR for MACE was 
0.4 for both upadacitinib and adalimumab. In the updated data with a cut-off date of Nov 2018, the IR 
for MACE was lower for upadacitinib (5 events or 0.3E/100PY) than for adalimumab (3 events or 0.5 
E/100PYs). The applicant presented a Kaplan-Meier curve for study M14-465 through 48 weeks (the 
time point up to which there is a direct comparison with the active comparator adalimumab), where no 
increased risk for MACE for upadacitinib compared to the active comparator adalimumab is indicated. 
Based on the totality of data above, there does not seem to be an increased risk for MACE in subjects 
treated with upadacitinib, compared to subjects treated with adalimumab (clinically relevant 
comparator).  
Subjects with a history of any of the following cardiovascular conditions were excluded from the pivotal 
studies: Moderate to severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV), 
Recent (within past 6 months) cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, coronary stenting; 
Uncontrolled hypertension as defined by a persistent, confirmed systolic blood pressure (BP) > 160 
mmHg or diastolic BP > 100 mmHg or Clinically relevant or significant ECG abnormalities.  
At the CHMP request, the applicant has included a warning regarding the CV risk in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. The risk for MACE is planned to be continuously followed post-approval. MACE is listed as a 
safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance 
activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
The frequency of VTE was numerically higher for UPA15 mg than for placebo (in short-term analysis up 
to 3 months), but similar to the risk for MTX and lower than the risk for adalimumab at long-term 
analysis (48 weeks).  
Based on investigator-reported adverse event data, the majority of VTE events were observed in 
patients with impaired renal function.  
A warning on the risk of VTE is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. At the CHMP’s request, the SmPC 
has been modified to mention that if clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should 
be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment. VTE is 
listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7).

Pregnancy 
Since the initial submission of this application, two additional live births without congenital anomalies 
have been reported for mothers exposed to upadacitinib during pregnancy. However, experience 
remains very limited, and there is evidence of potential teratogenicity in non-clinical studies. As 
discussed in the Non Clinical section, Upadacitinib is contraindicated during and should not be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Foetal malformation following exposure in utero is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate 
risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see 
Section 2.7). 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC will include language that no data are available on the response to vaccination 
with live or inactivated vaccines in patients receiving upadacitinib and that use with live, attenuated 
vaccines during, or immediately prior to, upadacitinib therapy is not recommended. Finally, the SmPC 
Section 4.4 states that prior to initiating upadacitinib, it is recommended that patients be brought up to 
date with all immunisations in agreement with current immunisation guidelines. Effect on vaccination 
efficacy is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional 
pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The proposed dose to be marketed (15 mg) is clearly preferable from a safety perspective than the 
higher dose of 30 mg.  
Safety data on upadacitinib in combination with other csDMARDs than MTX are limited since only 122 
subjects were exposed for any non-MTX-csDMARD in combination with the dose of upadacitinib 
proposed to be marketed (15 mg). Also, the results for these subjects on non-MTX-csDMARDs are 
somewhat worrisome, since the safety profile in less favourable than for the combination with MTX. 
There were numerically more AEs, SAEs, serious infections and haematologic disturbances in the non-
MTX-csDMARD group than in the MTX group. Hence, the applicant withdrew this claim from the 
indication during the assessment (see Efficacy section). The revised indication was as follows: 
“RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate”. 
The most commonly reported adverse drug reactions are upper respiratory tract infections (13.5%), 
nausea (3.5%), blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increased (2.5%) and cough (2.2%). The most 
common serious adverse reactions were serious infections. 
Important observed adverse events are infections, haematological disturbances, elevated liver 
enzymes and CPK elevations. The risk for malignancy and cardiovascular disorder needs to be further 
addressed in post-authorization studies. Based on the data submitted in this application, the risk for 
MACE and overall death does not appear higher for upadacitinib than for the comparator adalimumab. 
However, at the CHMP request, the applicant has included a warning regarding the CV risk in section 
4.4 of the SmPC. 
While exposure-response analyses may not suggest an increased risk of serious infections, a 
substantially higher risk of serious infections in subjects on upadacitinib 30 mg than 15 mg is clinically

observed. This raised a concern for subjects with impaired renal function. At CHMP’s request, Section 
4.2 of the SmPC includes precautionary message regarding patients with severely renal impaired 
patients. Use in patients with severe renal impairment is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and 
adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the 
RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Upadacitinib is contraindicated in active tuberculosis (TB) or active serious infections, severe hepatic 
impairment and pregnancy. Upadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of upadacitinib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers upadacitinib to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
statutory information (see below) on the medicinal product has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable. 
The following elements (statutory information) have been agreed to be provided through a QR code:  
• 
• 
Package leaflet 
Educational material for patients as outlined in the Risk Management Plan 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rinvoq (upadacitinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate or other conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs).” 
Patients with active RA have persistent synovitis with systemic inflammation leading to destruction of 
articular cartilage and bone, which ultimately interfere with function of the joint. Left untreated, or 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

Page 184/201 
 
 
 
inadequately treated, progressive functional impairment can ultimately lead to significant disability. 
Treatment of RA should be aimed at reaching a target of sustained low disease activity (or even 
remission); thus reducing the symptoms of active joint inflammation such as pain, stiffness and 
reduced joint function as well as preventing structural joint damage (long-term goal). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to EULAR recommendations (EULAR recommendations for the management of rheumatoid 
arthritis with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs: 2016 update), treatment 
should be initiated as soon as the RA diagnosis is made. Methotrexate (MTX) should be the first 
treatment strategy. In patients with contraindications to MTX (or early intolerance), leflunomide or 
sulfasalazine should be considered as the (first) line treatment strategy. If there is no improvement by 
at most 3 months after start of treatment or the target has not been reached by 6 months, therapy 
should be adjusted. Depending on whether poor prognostic factors are present or not, other csDMARD 
or addition of a bDMARD (biologic DMARD) or tsDMARD (targeted synthetic DMARD) could then be 
considered. JAK-inhibitors are tsDMARD. There are two other already approved JAK-inhibitors in EU; 
tofacitinib and baricitinib. 
Despite the recent advances in this therapeutic field, there all still patients who either cannot tolerate 
or do not respond to the available treatment options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical development programme included efficacy data from 8 controlled studies: 3 
supportive/dose-ranging studies: M13-537, M13-550 and M14-663 as well as 5 pivotal randomized, 
double-blind, Phase 3 studies: M13-545 (1st line RA treatment), M13-549, M14-465 and M15-555 
(≥2nd line), and M13-542 (3rd line). 
Based on the data from the 3 supportive/dose-ranging studies, the applicant chose 15 mg QD 
extended-release (equivalent to 6 mg BID immediate-release) and 30 mg QD extended-release 
(equivalent 12 mg BID immediate-release) as the doses to be tested in the phase 3 programme.  
In all the 5 phase III-studies, the analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted on FAS which 
included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and non-responder 
imputation (NRI) was used. 
Study M13-545 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) Once 
Daily Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) Monotherapy in MTX-Naïve Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis (Select Early)” included subjects with negative prognostic factors. 
The study compared upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy, and 30 mg QD monotherapy versus MTX 
monotherapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving CR defined by DAS28 
[CRP] < 2.6 at Week 24. Subjects who meet joint count rescue criteria at Week 16 or 20 were treated 
as non-responders for the primary analysis. Structural joint damage (mTSS) was included among the 
key secondary endpoints. 
Study M13-549 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Are on a Stable Dose 
of Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) and Have an 
Inadequate Response to csDMARDs (Select Next)” included subjects that had failed at least one of the 
following: MTX, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. Subjects with prior exposure to at most one bDMARD 
were eligible to be enrolled in the study if they had either exposure<3 months or had to discontinue 
due to intolerability. The study compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD versus placebo as 
Assessment report

add-on to stable dose of csDMARDs. The primary endpoint for was LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 
at Week 12. There seem to have been no rescue possibilities before assessment of the primary 
endpoint. 
Study M14-465 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo and to Adalimumab in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who 
are on a Stable Background of Methotrexate (MTX) and Who Have an Inadequate Response to MTX 
(MTX-IR) (Select Compare)” included subjects with negative prognostic factors. Subjects with prior 
exposure to at most one bDMARD were eligible to be enrolled if they had either exposure<3 months or 
had to discontinue the bDMARD due to intolerability. The study compared upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
versus placebo, and versus adalimumab (per approved label) as add-on to MTX. The primary endpoint 
was the proportion of subjects achieving CR based on DAS28 CRP < 2.6 at Week 12. The ranked 
secondary endpoints included structural damage (at week 26). Patients could be rescued and switch 
group at Weeks 14, 18, 22 or 26.  
Study M15-555 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) 
Monotherapy to Methotrexate (MTX) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid 
Arthritis with Inadequate Response to MTX” (Select Monotherapy)” compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
alone and 15 mg QD alone versus continuing MTX. The primary endpoint was the proportion of 
subjects achieving LDA (based on DAS28 [CRP] ≤ 3.2) at Week 14. No rescue was allowed before the 
timepoint at which the primary endpoint was analysed.  
Study M13-542 “A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Upadacitinib (ABT-494) to 
Placebo on Stable Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis with Inadequate Response or 
Intolerance to Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) (Select Beyond)”  compared upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 
15 mg QD versus placebo as add-on to a stable dose of csDMARDs in a randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group design during the first 12 weeks of the study. This period included no rescue-
possibilities. Study M13-542 had LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at week 12 as the primary 
endpoint.  
The design of the five main clinical trials is considered broadly in line with current EMA guidelines and 
previous CHMP Scientific Advice.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Data from the five pivotal trials 
In M13-545 (1st line, monotherapy), the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the primary 
endpoint CR at week 24 was in the MTX monotherapy (n=314), UPA 15 mg monotherapy (n=317) and 
UPA 30 mg monotherapy (n=314): 18.5 (14.2, 22.8), 48.3 (42.8, 53.8) and 50.0 (44.5, 55.5) %, p 
0.001 for both comparisons between MTX and Upa. Statistically significant improvements in the 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the MTX group were observed for all 
ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment.  The proportion of subjects with no 
radiographic progression at week 24 was in the MTX, UPA 15 mg and UPA 30 mg group: 77.7%, 
87.5% and 89.3% (nominal p-value 0.002 and <0.001 for the two respective comparisons with MTX).  
In M13-549 (≥ 2nd line, csDMARD add-on), the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the 
primary endpoint LDA at week 12, was a in the Placebo (n=221), UPA 15 mg (n=221) and UPA 30 mg 
group (n=119):  17.2 (12.2, 22.2), 48.4 (41.8, 55.0) and 47.9 (41.3, 54.6) %, p <0.001 for both 
comparisons between the active treatment arms and placebo. Statistically significant improvement in

both the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the placebo group were 
observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment.  
In M14-465 (≥ 2nd line, MTX add-on), the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the primary 
endpoint CR at week 12 was 28.7(25.2, 32.2) % when upadacitinib 15 mg (n=651) was added to MTX. 
For subjects that received placebo (n=651), the corresponding figure was 6.1% (4.3, 8.0), p<0.001 
for the comparison between the groups. Statistically significant improvement with upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD group compared with the placebo group were observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints 
using multiplicity adjustment. The proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression at week 26 
was 76.0% in the placebo group and 83.5% in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, p=0.001 for the 
comparison. One of the key secondary endpoints involved a comparison vs the active comparator 
adalimumab; the proportion of subjects achieving LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) ≤ 3.2 at Week 12 (non-
inferiority comparison of upadacitinib versus adalimumab). This endpoint (95% CI) was achieved in 
28.7 (23.8, 33.7) in the adalimumab group and 45.0 (41.2, 48.8) % in the upadacitinib group. The 
non-inferiority margin was 10% but the point estimate (95% CI) for between group difference was 
16.3% (10.0, 22.5) i.e. non-inferiority was met.  
In M15-555 (2nd line, monotherapy), the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the primary 
endpoint LDA at week 14 was 19.4 (14.2, 24.7) % in the cMTX-group (n=216) vs 44.7 (38.1, 51.3) % 
in the UPA 15 mg monotherapy group (n=217) and 53.0 (46.4, 59.7) % in the UPA 30 mg 
monotherapy group (n=215), p<0.001 for both comparisons between cMTX and upadacitinib. 
Statistically significant improvement in both the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups 
compared with the cMTX group were observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity 
adjustment.  
In M13-542 (3rd line, csDMARD add-on), the proportion of subjects (95% CI) that achieved the 
primary endpoint, LDA at week 12, was 43.3 (35.7, 50.9) % in the UPA 15 mg group (n=164), 42.4 
(34.9, 50.0) % in the UPA 30 mg group (n= 165) and 14.2 (8.9, 19.5) % in the placebo 
group(n=169), p<0.001 for both comparisons between upadacitinib and placebo. Statistically 
significant improvement in both the upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD groups compared with the 
placebo group were observed for all ranked key secondary endpoints using multiplicity adjustment.   
Across the five pivotal studies, the 30mg dose performed only marginally better than the 15mg dose. 
The results were generally consistent across relevant subgroups and a rapid onset of effect (as early as 
week 1-2) was noted. 
Data from analysis performed across trials 
Several integrated analyses across trial were conducted by the applicant. Two integrated analysis sets 
of the Phase 3 studies (M13-549, M14-465, and M13-542) were defined for the purpose of short-term 
integrated efficacy analyses. 
The short-term efficacy of upadacitinib was assessed in bDMARD-intolerant subjects versus other 
bDMARD-exposed subjects (that discontinued bDMARD therapy due to lack of efficacy or other 
reasons). Subgroup analysis was performed for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 in 
the two integrated analysis sets. For bDMARD-intolerant subjects in the Placebo-Controlled 
upadacitinib 15 mg Analysis Set (NRI), the proportion that achieved ACR20 at week 12 was 30.5% in 
the placebo group vs 62.7% in the upadacitinib 15 mg group. The corresponding figures for other 
bDMARD-exposed subjects in this set was 30.7% in the placebo group vs 65.6% in the upadacitinib 15 
mg QD-group. The finding in the other analysis-set was consistent with the finding in the first analysis 
set. For bDMARD-intolerant subjects in the Placebo-Controlled upadacitinib 15 mg Analysis Set (NRI), 
the proportion that achieved LDA at week 12 was 11.9% in the placebo group vs 49.2% in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019

upadacitinib group. The corresponding figures for other bDMARD-exposed subjects in this set was 
13.9% vs 44.1%. The finding in the other analysis-set was consistent with the finding in the first 
analysis set. 
The short-term efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with MTX versus other non-MTX csDMARDs was 
examined. To examine the short-term placebo-controlled efficacy of upadacitinib in combination with 
MTX versus other csDMARDs, a model-based analysis assessing the interaction between treatment 
effect and background csDMARD type was conducted for ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at 
Week 12 within Studies M13-542 and M13-549, respectively. In study M13-549, for subjects treated 
with concomitant MTX (FAS, NRI), the proportion that achieved LDA at week 12 was 16.8% in the 
placebo group vs 49.1% in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD group. The corresponding figures for subjects 
treated with other csDMARDs were 20.7% in the placebo group and 45.1% in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD group. In study M13-542, for subjects treated with concomitant MTX (FAS, NRI), the proportion 
that achieved LDA at week 12 was 13.7% in the placebo group and 43.4% in the upadacitinib 15 mg 
QD group. The corresponding figures for subjects with other csDMARDs were 13.8% in the placebo 
group and 45.8% in the upadacitinib 15 mg QD group. 
A cross-study analysis was conducted to provide an indirect comparison of the short-term efficacy of 
upadacitinib as monotherapy versus in combination with MTX in the MTX-IR population. A model-based 
analysis was conducted on subjects from Studies M13-549 and M15-555. Analyses were conducted for 
ACR20 and LDA based on DAS28 (CRP) at Week 12 (Study M13-549)/Week 14 (Study M15-555). 
According to this analysis (pooled analysis set; M13-549 and M15-555, NRI) the proportion of subjects 
that achieved LDA (at week 12/14) on upadacitinib 15 mg QD monotherapy was 44.7% and on 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD+MTX 48.6%.  
Maintenance of efficacy should be demonstrated in a long-term randomized study where blinding and 
an active control is maintained for in total 12 months study duration; descriptive statistics may suffice.  
The applicant presented efficacy data through Week 60 for Studies M13-549 and M13-542 and through 
Week 48 for Studies M13-545 (active control until week 48), M14-465 (active control until week 48), 
and M15-555, with approximately 78%, 74%, 80%, 87%, and 84%, respectively, of subjects 
remaining in the study through the last summarized visit (by the data cut-off date). According to the 
presented descriptive AO data, the treatment effect of upadacitinib, including the joint damage 
preventing effect, appears to be maintained up to and beyond one year.  
In conclusion, data from the primary efficacy analyses of the four pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies and 
the supportive phase 3 study in MTX-naïve patients, as well as the phase 2 dose-finding studies 
demonstrated efficacy of upadacitinib. Both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and ranked key 
secondary endpoints across all Phase 3 studies, including prevention of structural progression in two 
studies. Compared to adalimumab, higher rates of low disease activity were achieved at week 12 in 
one of the studies that included adalimumab as an active comparator. 
Across studies, around half of the patients could attain a low disease activity state during the 
controlled periods of the studies (ranging from 12 to 26 weeks), and about one third of subjects 
achieved clinical remission. The long-term extensions of the studies are still ongoing, but interim data 
up to 60 weeks demonstrate that the treatment response to upadacitinib is preserved over time. The 
results were consistent across the different efficacy and patient-reported outcomes and in various 
subgroups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Similar short-term efficacy appears to be achieved by upadacitinib monotherapy compared to 
upadacitinib + MTX although a noteworthy limitation of the data is that direct head-to-head 
Assessment report

Page 188/201 
 
 
 
comparisons between monotherapy and combination therapy are not available. However, little is 
known about the benefit of upadacitinib monotherapy vs the combination with MTX in terms of 
radiological progression and long-term outcome. For upadacitinib, radiological progression was 
measured as key secondary outcome in two studies; M13-545 and M14-465 in which one was indeed a 
monotherapy study (M13-545) and the other was not (M14-465). However, since M14-465 included 
MTX-IR and M13-545 included MTX-naïve subjects, a direct comparison between the outcome of these 
studies cannot be made.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events 
The frequency of adverse events in short-term analysis (3 months) was 49.6% when upadacitinib was 
given in monotherapy (compared to 48.3% for MTX), and 56% when upadacitinib was given in 
combination with other csDMARDs (vs 48.4% for placebo+csDMARD, and 48.3% for 
adalimumab+MTX). The frequency of SAEs was 3.0 % for upadacitinib in monotherapy (vs 2.3% for 
MTX) and 3.4% when upadacitinib was given in combination with other csDMARDs (vs 1.8 % for 
placebo+csDMARDs and 2.4% for adalimumab+MTX). A dose-dependent relationship was seen when 
comparing 15 and 30 mg upadacitinib.  
Deaths 
There were 20 cases of death among patients treated with upadacitinib 15 mg in the phase 3 studies. 
Cardiovascular disease was the most frequent cause of death. The exposure-adjusted IR of deaths was 
0.5/100PY for upadacitinib 15 mg, 0.8 for MTX and 1.2 for adalimumab in the short-term analysis (3 
month, based on data from all five phase III studies). The exposure-adjusted IR of deaths was 0.5 for 
upadacitinib, 0.3 for MTX and 0.9 for adalimumab in updated pooled long-term analysis to week 48 
(based on all five phase III studies). 
Serious infections 
In short-term analysis (3 months), the frequency of serious infections was 0.6% for upadacitinib 15 
mg in monotherapy (vs 0.4% for MTX), 1.2% for upadacitinib in combination with other csDMARDs (vs 
0.6% for placebo+csDMARDs and 1.2% for adalimumab+MTX). During long-term exposure in study 
M14-465 with a direct comparison with adalimumab, the IR of serious infections was 4.1/100PY for 
upadacitinib 15 mg vs 4.3/100PY for adalimumab.  
During long-term exposure (up to 1 year), the incidence rate of serious infections was lower for UPA 15 
mg than for UPA 30 mg in pooled data.  
Opportunistic Infections 
In short-term analysis up to 3 months, opportunistic infections occurred in 0.5% of upadacitinib-
treated subjects and 0.3% in placebo-treated subjects (both in combination with csDMARDs). In 
monotherapy up to 3 months, there were no opportunistic infections in the upadacitinib 15 mg group.  
Herpes zoster 
Episodes of herpes zoster were reported at an increased rate with upadacitinib compared to both 
placebo as well as either of the active controls, and reporting rates were higher with 30 mg than with 
15 mg. In the Any Ph 3 UPA 15 analysis set (N = 2,630), the long-term EAER for herpes zoster with 
upadacitinib 15 mg was 3.7 E/100 PY. 75% of the events involved a single dermatome; there were 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 189/201 
 
 
 
2 events of ophthalmic herpes zoster, 1 event of disseminated herpes zoster, and 5 events of 
postherpetic neuralgia. Risk factors for herpes zoster, as identified by the Applicant, were prior herpes 
zoster history, older age, as well as geographic region (with the reporting rate being higher in Asia). 
The observation of increased rates of herpes zoster is common across the class of JAK inhibitors. 
Tuberculosis 
There were 5 cases of active TB infection among upadacitinib-treated subjects. Upadacitinib is 
contraindicated in patients with active TB infections. In addition, as stated in Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
patients should be screened for latent TB before starting upadacitinib treatment.  
Hepatic disorder 
In short-term analysis up to 3 months, the proportion of subjects with ALT ≥ 3 × ULN was 2.1% in the 
upadacitinib group compared to 1.5% for placebo when upadacitinib was combined with csDMARDs, 
and 1.7% when upadacitinib was given in monotherapy (compared to 3.6% for MTX). Transaminase 
elevations is described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request.  
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) were excluded from the phase 3 studies. As 
severe hepatic impairment is expected to lead to an increased exposure of upadacitinib, and 
considering the less favourable safety profile observed with the 30 mg dose, the CHMP requested 
upadacitinib to be contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh C. 
VTE 
The IR of VTE was 0.8/100PY for UPA15 mg vs 0.4/100PY for placebo. During long-term exposure, the 
IR was 0.6/100 PY for upadacitinib 15 mg and MTX, vs 1.1/100PY for adalimumab. A warning is 
proposed in 4.4, which is considered acceptable. 
A warning on the risk of VTE is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. At the CHMP’s request, the SmPC 
has been modified to mention that if clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib treatment should 
be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment. 
Gastrointestinal perforations 
In the phase 2 and phase 3 studies, 5 subjects in the upadacitinib 15 mg group experienced GI 
perforations. There were no events of GI perforation identified in subjects receiving MTX/other 
csDMARDs, or adalimumab.  
The observed frequency of gastrointestinal perforations was not higher among upadacitinib-treated 
subjects than frequency observed in a background population. 
Neutropenia 
There was a higher proportion of subjects in the UPA 15 and 30 mg groups experiencing neutropenia 
than in the placebo group. The fundamental concern of neutropenia being associated with an increased 
susceptibility to infections cannot be excluded. 
Neutropenia is therefore considered an important unfavourable effect and is listed in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. Dosing recommendations in case of neutropenia are also provided in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 190/201 
 
 
 
CPK elevations 
CPK elevations were observed in 2.8 % of upadacitinib 15 mg-treated patients, vs in 0.6% of placebo-
treated patients (both in combination with csDMARDs) during the first 3 months. The majority had a 
mild increase of >2.5-5 x ULN. This ADR is described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
MACE 
There were 13 cases of cardiovascular death among upadacitinib-treated subjects; 7 on upadacitinib 
15 mg and 6 on upadacitinib 30 mg. All of these cases had cardiovascular risk factors (such as 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidaemia or obesity).  
In the updated long-term exposure analysis of all phase 3 studies (data to week 48 and beyond), the 
exposure-adjusted IR for MACE was very similar for MTX (2/314 events/100PY, IR=0.6), upadacitinib 
15 mg (16/2630 events/100PY, IR=0.5), and adalimumab (3/579 events/100PY, IR=0.5).   
At the CHMP request, the Applicant has included a warning regarding the CV risk in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. The risk for MACE is planned to be continuously followed post-approval. 
Lipids 
Upadacitinib 15 mg treatment was associated with increases in lipid parameters including total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Elevations in LDL and HDL cholesterol 
peaked by week 8 and remained stable thereafter. Up to 12/14 weeks, the following changes were 
noted for upadacitinib 15 mg: 
•  Mean LDL cholesterol increased by 0.38 mmol/L. 
•  Mean HDL cholesterol increased by 0.21 mmol/L. 
• 
The mean LDL/HDL ratio remained stable. 
•  Mean triglycerides increased by 0.15 mmol/L. 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC adequately reflect the risks and provide monitoring guidance for 
the prescribers. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important uncertainties relate to unfavourable effects of long latency and low frequency on one hand, 
and effects on multiple laboratory parameters with uncertain clinical correlates on the other hand. The 
long-latency low-frequency events of primary interest, for which long-term follow-up data will be 
required for a robust characterisation of any risk increase, are: 
Malignancies  
In data reported to date, the overall incidence of malignancies (0.8 n/100 PY in the Any PH 3 UPA 15 
analysis set) was within the range reported for comparable programs, and the types of malignancies 
reported were variable and seem to reflect overall incidences of different malignancies in an RA 
population. However, a dose-dependent risk on NMSC cannot be excluded, but the observation is 
based on small numbers. At the CHMP’s request, an adequate warning has been included in Section 
4.4 of the SmPC. The risk of malignancy will be followed post approval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/608624/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 191/201 
 
 
 
Major adverse cardiovascular events  
The overall incidence rate of adjudicated MACE of 0.5 n/100 PY for upadacitinib 15 mg reported in the 
program falls within the range reported in other programs, and in comparative analyses, the 95% CI 
for treatment comparisons against both adalimumab and MTX spanned 0. Upadacitinib-induced 
increases in cholesterol levels were not observed to correlate with the risk of MACE, and E/R analyses 
did not demonstrate exposure dependency in MACE events. At the CHMP request, the applicant has 
included a warning regarding the CV risk in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The risk for MACE will be followed 
post approval. 
Venous thromboembolic events  
The calculated overall EAIR of adjudicated VTE events (0.6 n/100 PY) for upadacitinib 15 mg was 
within the background incidence of 0.3 - 0.8 n/100 PY quoted by the Applicant for the general RA 
population. It was also lower than that observed for intra-program comparators (MTX and 
adalimumab). There is however a concern regarding an increased risk of VTE associated with other JAK 
inhibitors. A warning on the risk of VTE is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. At the CHMP’s request, 
the SmPC has been modified to mention that if clinical features of DVT/PE occur, upadacitinib 
treatment should be discontinued and patients should be evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate 
treatment. The risk for VTE will be followed post approval. 
The laboratory parameters of interest in terms of risk assessment are: 
•  Hepatic enzyme elevations 
Upadacitinib was associated with a small (< 10 U/L) mean increase in hepatic enzymes that persisted 
on long-term treatment. However, most events were asymptomatic and transient even in the setting of 
continued use of upadacitinib and there is currently no evidence of actual hepatotoxicity. 
Transaminase elevations is described in Section 4.8 of the SmPC at the CHMP’s request.  
•  Lymphocyte counts  
Upadacitinib, on one hand, induces an increase in mean lymphocyte counts that reverts to baseline 
over the course of several months. On the other hand, decreased counts were frequently observed in 
individual patients. With this mixed pattern, and currently no actual observation of an association of 
decreased lymphocyte counts being associated with increased infections, the finding is considered a 
limitation (in contrast to the consistent decrease in neutrophils being considered an actual 
unfavourable effect). Hence, monitoring guidelines and instructions on potential treatment 
interruptions are included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
•  Lipids 
Upadacitinib induces a rapid and persistent increase of 10-15% across all lipid classes. The clinical 
consequences, if any, remain to be determined. Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC adequately 
reflect the risks and provide monitoring guidance. 
Deaths 
Although the mortality does not seem to be increased in subjects treated with upadacitinib compared 
to adalimumab, mortality will be carefully evaluated post-approval.

Pregnancy and lactation 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. Upadacitinib was teratogenic in rats and rabbits 
with effects in bones in rat foetuses and in the heart in rabbit foetuses when exposed in utero. 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from the upadacitinib clinical trials. Upadacitinib is 
contraindicated during pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective 
contraception during treatment and for 4 weeks following the final dose of upadacitinib. 
Upadacitinib should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Adequate risk minimization measures and pharmacovigilance activities are included in the RMP to 
address the risk of foetal malformation following exposure in utero. 
Severe renal impairment 
Upadacitinib was associated with a consistent increase in serum creatinine, averaging about 10% at 
the 15 mg dose. The rate of serious adverse events, severe adverse events and adverse events leading 
to discontinuation is increased in patients with mild renal impairment compared to patients with normal 
renal function, and the rates are increased even further in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
Increased rates are also seen in corresponding placebo groups. While exposure-response analyses may 
not suggest an increased risk of serious infections, a substantially higher risk of serious infections in 
subjects on upadacitinib 30 mg than 15 mg was clinically observed. Further safety information from 
the moderate renal impairment group is required post approval.  
At CHMP’s request, Section 4.2 of the SmPC includes precautionary message regarding patients with 
severely renal impaired patients. Use in patients with severe renal impairment is listed as a safety 
concern in the RMP and adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities 
are in included in the RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Severe hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) were excluded from the phase 3 studies. As 
severe hepatic impairment is expected to lead to an increased exposure of upadacitinib, and 
considering the less favourable safety profile observed with the 30 mg dose, the CHMP requested 
upadacitinib to be contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh C.  
Use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is listed as a safety concern in the RMP and 
adequate risk minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the 
RMP (see Section 2.7). 
Combination with csDMARDs other than MTX 
The majority of the patients on concomitant csDMARDs were on MTX. Due to paucity of data, the use 
of upadacitinib together with csDMARDs other than MTX is not considered to be sufficiently 
characterised. In fact, the safety profile in subjects treated with csDMARDs other than MTX seem to be 
less favourable than the safety profile in subjects treated with MTX. Hence, the Applicant withdrew this 
claim for use “with other csDMARDs” from the indication during the assessment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
Study M13-545 demonstrates favourable effects that can to some extent be extrapolated to the 
proposed target population (2nd and 3rd line indication).  
Study M13-549 indicates that when upadacitinib 15 mg is given as ≥2nd line RA treatment as add-on 
to csDMARD, after 3 months, the treatment goal low disease activity is achieved by almost half of the 
patients. This effect is clearly clinically relevant and of importance for the overall assessment of benefit 
in the proposed target population.  
Study M14-465 showed that when upadacitinib 15 mg is given as ≥2nd line RA treatment as add-on to 
MTX, after 3 months, 28.7% of the patients achieve the very high hurdle endpoint clinical remission. 
The corresponding figure for placebo was 6.1%. After 26 weeks a difference between the two groups 
with regards to the proportion of subjects with no radiographic progression was noted. One of the key 
secondary endpoints involved a non-inferiority comparison vs the active comparator adalimumab. The 
CHMP considered that the comparator was relevant as it represents one of the standards of care 
choices in second line treatment. The proportion of subjects achieving low disease activity at Week 12 
was compared and non-inferiority was met. 
It is also of interest that in M14-465, upadacitinib 15 mg does not perform worse in the subgroup with 
previous bDMARD use compared to group with no previous bDMARD use (patients with <3 month 
exposure of bDMARD/who had discontinued bDMARD due to intolerability could be included in the 
study). Thus, when upadacitinib is added to MTX in a group of MTX-IR patients that also have previous 
bDMARD experience (i.e. would correspond more to the 3rd line situation), almost a third achieve the 
high-hurdle endpoint clinical remission.  
Study M15-555 shows that when upadacitinib 15 mg is given as monotherapy 2nd line, after 14 weeks, 
44.7% of the subjects achieve the treatment goal low disease activity. Although the superiority 
comparison between MTX and upadacitinib that was carried out within this study has its clear 
limitations (the MTX arm being undertreated by definition, as pointed out in previous SA), cross-study 
comparisons that include the comparison between upadacitinib 15 mg monotherapy and upadacitinib 
15 mg + MTX (an acceptable approach according to previous CHMP SA) indicate that at least short 
term, these two treatment regimens confer similar beneficial effects. Thus, taken together, the CHMP 
consider the data clinically relevant to support the proposed monotherapy indication second line. 
Study M13-542 indicates that also when upadacitinib 15 mg is given 3rd line as add-on to csDMARD, 
>40% of the patients achieve the treatment goal low disease activity. Although the limitations with 
regards to the comparison with placebo are acknowledged (as pointed out in previous SA), the results 
are considered clinically relevant.  
The treatment effect of upadacitinib, including the joint damage preventing effect, appears to be 
maintained up to and beyond one year. 
Across studies, a rapid onset of effect has been noted which is favourable for patients suffering from 
acute symptoms of arthritis.  
Another favourable effect is the oral mode of administration, which is convenient for patients.

Importance of unfavourable effects 
Safety problems with upadacitinib include infections, neutropenia, cardiovascular events, thrombosis, 
elevated liver enzymes and elevated CPK. These risks are considered possible to handle through 
adequate information in the SmPC. Long-term effects with regards to malignancy are currently unclear 
and will be closely monitored post approval (see RMP section). 
The risk of increased infectious liability is inherent for any immunomodulatory therapy and is also 
clearly present with upadacitinib. In this respect, the CHMP considers that this risk can be managed 
with continued vigilance and educational efforts, as described in the RMP. The same holds true for 
herpes zoster; prescribers and patients considering upadacitinib therapy will need to accept an 
increased susceptibility to an episode of herpes zoster, and the risk will be greatest for patients with a 
previous history of zoster.  
Regarding mortality, in the short-term analysis set (3 months) based on the phase III studies (M13-
545, M13-549, M14-465, M15-555, M13-542), the IR for death appeared comparable for the 
upadacitinib 15 mg, MTX, placebo and adalimumab. It is noted that the lowest figure was actually seen 
for upadacitinib 15 mg although the comparison is hampered by the small exposure and low number of 
absolute events in the different arms. Also in the long-term analysis set (48 weeks) based on the 
phase 3 studies (M13-545, M13-549, M14-465, M15-555, M13-542), the calculated mortality rates 
appear similar. The rate for upadacitinib 15 mg was numerically higher than for MTX but lower than for 
adalimumab but again the comparison is hampered by relatively low exposure and absolute number of 
events (in the comparator arms). The mortality rates did not substantially differ according to treatment 
received in this population with active, potentially debilitating inflammatory disease in which underlying 
risk factors for both CV death and infections are expected to be frequent. Again, at the CHMP’s 
request, those risks are adequately described in the SmPC and adequate risk minimisation measures / 
additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data submitted support that upadacitinib, in the proposed posology 15 mg once daily (taken 
orally), has a clinically relevant effect with regards to in inducing remission or low disease activity in 
patients with active RA both as 2nd and 3rd line treatment. Both upadacitinib monotherapy and 
upadacitinib in combination with different csDMARDs, including methotrexate, are able to induce 
remission and low disease activity.  The magnitude of effect of upadacitinib was non-inferior to 
adalimumab (direct comparison). For many of the analysed outcomes, an effect was seen as early as 
week 1-2. A favourable effect with regards to haltering radiological progression has been 
demonstrated.  
Unfavourable effects include infections, neutropenia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lipid levels, and 
CPK elevation. The reported study mortality was comparable to that of the active comparator 
adalimumab. Unfavourable effects are adequately described in the SmPC and adequate risk 
minimisation measures / additional pharmacovigilance activities are in included in the RMP. 
From an efficacy-point-of view, the combination of upadacitinib and other csDMARDs could have been 
considered supported by the CHMP. However, from a safety perspective, the CHMP considered that it 
was not appropriate to conclude positively on an indication in combination with other csDMARDs.  
Indeed, the observed safety profile was less favourable with the combination of upadacitinib and other 
csDMARDs. Hence, the Applicant withdrew this claim from the indication during the assessment (see 
Safety section). The revised indication is as follows:

“RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate”. 
The CHMP considered that the favourable effects in this revised indication outweigh the unfavourable 
effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefits/risks of Rinvoq is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Rinvoq is favourable in the following indication: 
RINVOQ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult 
patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying 
anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RINVOQ may be used as monotherapy or in combination with 
methotrexate

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative sense, single stranded RNA orthopneumovirus that 
causes infections of the human respiratory tract. RSV cases follow a seasonal pattern in many 
countries that is in line with that of influenza, causing illness primarily in the cooler months of the year 
in temperate regions and during the wet season in tropical countries with seasonal rainfall. RSV can 
affect any age group and almost all children have serological evidence of exposure to the virus by the 
age of 2 years. Although first infections are likely to be symptomatic, repeated infections occur 
throughout life and it seems they are often asymptomatic. However, first and repeated infections may 
result in anything from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe and life-threatening lower 
respiratory tract involvement, with a significant mortality rate in some at-risk subgroups. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
RSV disease in adults 
RSV disease burden reported in 2015 demonstrated there were approximately 1.5 million episodes of 
acute respiratory infections (ARIs) due to RSV (RSV-ARI) in adults ≥65 years of age in industrialised 
countries. Approximately 15% of RSV-ARI cases led to hospitalisation. The burden of adult RSV disease 
could be underestimated since testing for RSV is less common in older adults than in children and 
some types of tests did not/do not detect low levels of virus shedding in older adults.  
In Europe, RSV infection can also be serious for adults aged 50 years and older as it can cause acute 
respiratory infection, influenza-like illness or community-acquired pneumonia. Annual RSV attack rates 
of 4.2% and 7.2% were observed in community-living adults aged ≥60 years in successive seasons. In 
UK adults aged from 18 years, some authors have estimated of 487,247 outpatient episodes, 17,799 
hospitalisations and 8482 attributable deaths per season. Of these, 36% of GP episodes, 79% of 
hospitalisations and 93% of deaths were in ≥65-year-olds. 
RSV infection has been associated with up to 22% of acute COPD exacerbations in prospective cohort 
studies and 11% of wintertime hospitalisations for COPD exacerbations. In industrialised countries, the 
case fatality rate of RSV-ARI was 11.7% for adults with comorbidity but 1.6% for the general 
population.  
There are some recognised risk factors for severe RSV disease in older adults, including the elderly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 9/151 
 
 
 
 
Immunosenescence can result in a weakened immune response to pathogens and suboptimal response 
to vaccines. In addition, there may be reduced lung expansion in older adults because of decreased 
strength of the respiratory muscles and the diaphragm. Older adults may also have decreased 
protective mucus levels, lung compliance and elastin. 
RSV disease in infants 
RSV is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children. It may cause bronchiolitis 
and pneumonia and can lead to fatal respiratory distress. Globally, there are an estimated 33 million 
episodes of RSV-associated ALRI each year in children aged <5 years resulting in an estimated 3.6 
million hospitalisations. Among children <6 months there are an estimated 6.6 million RSV-associated 
ALRI episodes and 1.4 million hospitalisations.  
RSV is a leading cause of paediatric hospitalisation in Europe. In a recent study of the aetiology of 
severe ARI requiring hospitalisation conducted in 7 countries, RSV was identified as the most common 
cause of ARI hospitalisations in young children, causing one third of ARI admissions. In a separate 
European study, rates of RSV hospitalisation varied by country from 8.6 to 22.3 per 1,000 children <1 
year of age but patterns across age were remarkably similar. In all countries, RSV-associated 
hospitalisation rates were significantly higher in children <1 year of age compared to those 1-4 years 
of age and decreased with increasing age. RSV admissions peaked among infants <1 month. 
While virtually all children experience RSV in the first 2 years of life, rates of RSV hospitalisation in 
infancy are greater among those with medical (e.g. prematurity, low levels of maternal neutralising 
antibodies) and socioeconomic risk factors. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
RSV infects humans via the upper respiratory tract, where viral replication commences. If unchecked, 
the virus may spread to the lower airways where local pathological changes in response to active viral 
replication may result in impaired oxygenation of the blood. 
During RSV entry into host cells, the trimeric viral fusion protein (RSV F) rearranges from a prefusion 
to a post-fusion conformation. As it rearranges, F fuses the viral and host cell membranes. Structural 
data show that the post-fusion F conformation targeted by many prior failed vaccine approaches is 
very different from the predominant prefusion conformation that is present on virions. The structural 
difference between conformations results in antigenic differences. In contrast to post-fusion F, 
prefusion F is in a metastable conformation that needs to be stabilised to be useful as an improved 
vaccine antigen. 
Furthermore, RSV has two subgroups – RSV A and RSV B. The RSV F of A and B subgroups is ~90% 
identical and it is the primary target of neutralising antibodies that also show some degree of cross-
neutralisation. Most of the sequence differences between the mature F glycoproteins of the subgroups 
are concentrated in the prefusion-specific epitopes that elicit the majority of RSV-neutralising and 
protective antibody responses. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The clinical presentation is very variable, as described above. The manifestations of the disease vary 
according to primary or repeated infection (and thereby by age), size of airways and underlying host 
conditions that predispose to progression to severe LRTI. 
The diagnosis of RSV infection may involve detection of the virus or viral antigens or virus specific 
nucleic acid sequences in respiratory secretions. The kind and quality of the clinical specimen 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 10/151 
 
 
 
influences the sensitivity and specificity of viral detection methods. A nasal wash or a nasopharyngeal 
aspirate is more sensitive for the detection of RSV than a nasopharyngeal swab. However, flocked 
nasopharyngeal-swabs effectively dislodge and collect virus-infected cells lining the nasopharynx, 
which significantly increases the diagnostic yield. 
Laboratory methods currently available for the detection of RSV include virus isolation in tissue culture, 
detection of viral antigens (e.g. using Direct Fluorescent Assays/Indirect fluorescent Assays or Enzyme 
Immunoassays) and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), predominantly reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Viral culture really requires direct and rapid transfer to a 
laboratory since shipping samples reduces viral yield. Antigen detection kits are widely used. In 
specimens from infants and toddlers, their sensitivity ranges from 72 to 94% although specificity is 95 
to 100% compared to cell culture. However, in RSV-experienced older children and adults, detection 
rates for EIA are extremely low with sensitivities of 0 to 20%, reflecting lower and shorter viral 
shedding vs. primary infections.  
Nucleic acid assays are the most sensitive and specific methods for the detection of RSV, regardless of 
the patient population tested. Of the different nucleic acid amplification techniques, RT-PCR was the 
first of these and it remains the most frequently used NAAT. Commercial kits are available. 
New PCR techniques, such as real-time PCR methods, enable the simultaneous performance of 
amplification and detection and result in a turnaround time of a few hours. Multiplex PCR tests may 
also allow simultaneous amplification of RSV together with various other respiratory viruses that cause 
similar clinical symptoms. Highly sensitive monoplex or multiplex PCR assays indicate that up to 10-
30% of respiratory illness cases and up to 50% of RSV infections in infants represent mixed infections.  
Some authors reported an increased risk of more severe disease or of admission to a paediatric ICU for 
dual respiratory virus infections. Real-time PCR also allows quantification of viral nucleic acids present 
in a sample. As far as RSV is concerned, higher viral loads seem to correspond with a more severe 
clinical course of the disease and an increased likelihood of recurrence of wheezing.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently, there is no authorised vaccine to prevent RSV disease. Treatment of RSV disease consists 
primarily of supportive care (e.g. oxygen, hydration and suctioning of secretions). The use of 
aerosolised ribavirin is usually limited to immunosuppressed persons due to inconvenient 
administration, questionable benefit, teratogenicity concerns and high cost. 
Palivizumab is authorised for immunoprophylaxis, given as monthly injections during RSV seasons. In 
Europe, it is commonly used in infants aged <6 months who were born before 35 weeks of gestation 
and children aged <2 years of age who have been treated for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the 
last 6 months or have a serious heart condition. 
The effectiveness of palivizumab highlighted the importance of neutralising antibodies in protection 
against RSV disease. Subsequently, nirsevimab was developed as a single dose, extended half-life 
prefusion F-specific mAb. It demonstrated efficacy against RSV LRTI in Phase 3 studies and was given 
EU marketing authorisation in October 2022.

contemporary strains). They lack the transmembrane regions and cytoplasmic tails. They are fused to 
fibritin foldon trimerisation domains at the C-termini of the remaining native sequences. The vaccine is 
prepared for injection by reconstituting the lyophilised drug product with sterile water for injection. The 
vaccine (0.5 mL/dose) is given intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle of adults. 
The nature of this protein-based vaccine is such that the prevailing scientific opinion is that it might not 
be suitable for primary immunisation of RSV-naïve infants. The concerns rest on the prior experience 
with an inactivated whole virion RSV vaccine in RSV-naive children where the vaccine not only failed to 
protect against RSV disease, but it was associated with enhanced severity of disease. Evidence 
suggests that vaccine-associated disease enhancement was due to elicitation of non-neutralising 
antibodies that facilitated RSV spread between host cells. The applicant has directed development of 
RSVpreF to use in RSV-experienced persons, with a focus on two groups.   
Older adults 
Reinfection following a primary RSV exposure occurs throughout life due to short-lived natural 
immunity. RSV-infected older adults have significantly lower serum RSV-neutralising antibody titres 
and RSV-specific IgG levels than uninfected age-matched controls. The evidence supports an important 
role for serum neutralising titres in reducing the risk of RSV disease in older adults. In these naturally 
primed individuals, the administration of RSVpreF should act as a booster. The unanswered question is 
whether further doses could be required before each RSV season or, perhaps, at longer intervals.  
Maternal immunisation to prevent RSV disease in infants 
There is an early peak of RSV disease at around 1 to 2 months after birth. Post-natal active 
immunisation of infants with a suitable vaccine (to be identified) is not likely to address these early 
and often very severe cases. Moreover, maximum protection of infants via active immunisation of 
infants may require several priming doses. 
Pregnant women are universally RSV experienced so they are not at risk for vaccine-associated RSV 
disease enhancement. Furthermore, only maternal IgG reaches the unborn infant and administration of 
palivizumab to neonates has not been associated with RSV disease enhancement. Therefore, 
augmentation of anti-RSV neutralizing antibodies in pregnant women has potential to result in passive 
protection of their infants, as long as sufficient maternal antibody persists in infant serum. This 
strategy is effective for short-term post-natal prevention of pertussis and tetanus in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated during pregnancy. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the therapeutic innovation of the 
candidate vaccine, in the context of an identified unmet medical need for the treatment of RSV disease 
in both infants up to 6 months of age and older adults.  
The protection against lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants from birth through 6 
months of age, following maternal immunisation during pregnancy was considered a major public 
interest.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is a presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection containing 
equal amounts of the active substances (AS), two RSV F antigens stabilised in the prefusion 
conformation, denoted 847A and 847B, representing the two major RSV subgroups A and B, 
respectively. The vaccine is designed to deliver a 60 μg dose of each prefusion protein antigen, 
equivalent to 120 μg dose of total protein in a 0.5 mL injection. 
The other ingredients are trometamol, trometamol hydrochloride, sucrose, mannitol, polysorbate 80, 
sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and water for injections (solvent). 
The finished product powder is supplied in a 2 mL clear glass vial. Prior to use, the lyophilised FP is 
reconstituted with solvent (water for injections) in a single-use prefilled syringe using a vial adapter 
and the entire contents are withdrawn to enable a dose of 0.5 mL for administration as an 
intramuscular injection. The product may be supplied with a co-packaged syringe needle. CE 
certificates for the vial adapters and needle are provided. The applicant provided evidence of 
compliance of the pre-filled syringe with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements 
(GSPRs) of the Medical Device Regulation ((EU 2017/745). 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
847A and 847B antigens are trimeric, recombinant glycoprotein ectodomain antigens from RSV 
produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.  
The sequence used for the 847A AS is derived from the Ontario RSV strain while the 847B sequence 
has been derived from the Buenos Aires RSV strain. Both recombinant proteins have been engineered 
to trimerise through the inclusion of a bacteriophage T4 foldon domain. Both proteins undergo post-
translational modification with three cleavage events removing the signal peptide and excising an 
amino acid sequence designated p27. This generates two peptides, termed F1 and F2, which bind 
covalently and subsequently trimerise to generate the 847A or 847B antigen.                                                                    
847A covalently bound peptides have a theoretical mass of 57,868.9 – 65,325.6 Da, while the 
trimerised form has a theoretical molecular mass of 173,606.7 – 195,976.8 Da. 847B covalently bound 
peptides have a theoretical mass of 59,089.1 – 65,545.8 Da, while the trimerised form has a 
theoretical mass of 174,267.3 – 196,637.4 Da. The biological function of 847A and 847B recombinant 
antigens is to elicit neutralising antibodies against RSV. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substances are manufactured in Wyeth BioPharma, Andover MA, USA. Appropriate GMP 
authorisation is in place. GMP authorisation is also available for sites responsible for testing and 
storage.   
The 847A and 847B manuacturing processes are highly similar with some specified differences. The 
847A and 847B AS manufacturing process follows a standard method for recombinant protein 
Assessment report

production. The recombinant protein is produced in CHO cells and involves several bioprocessing steps 
and purification steps. The manufacturing process is sufficiently well described with process 
parameters provided and in-process controls in place. 
A single 847A or 847B AS batch is manufactured from individual production fed-batch bioreactors to 
produce commercial scale material. The upstream bioprocessing steps include the thawing of a WCB 
following multiple step expansion and harvest. In-process tests for control (IPT-C) is defined as an in-
process test with associated acceptance criteria. Adequate IPT-C have been established for the 
upstream and the downstream processes.  
The downstream purification process comprises of seven steps with ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) 
steps, chromatography steps, a viral retaining filtration (VRF) step, a formulation and filtration step. 
The antigen is dispensed in specified storage containers for storage.  
Cleaning validation data were requested for the resins and have been provided. Process parameters 
have been registered in the dossier. 
The reprocessing procedures registered for 847A and 847B are identical between both. Reprocessing 
procedures have been registered for two steps of the process. Criteria for a reprocessing event to 
occur are registered in the dossier. 
Control of materials  
A list of compendial and non-compendial raw materials, their compendial status and use within the 
manufacturing process has been provided for 847A and 847B antigens. Specifications have been 
registered for non-compendial raw materials and chromatography resins. The cell culture medium is 
chemically defined and protein free, containing no proteins or peptide components of animal, plant, or 
synthetic origin. The qualitative composition of the cell culture media used in the manufacture of 847A 
and 847B has been provided.  
The development of the expression plasmids has been sufficiently well described, the construction 
process is in line with Ph. Eur. 0784 and plasmid maps have been included in the dossier.  
The 847A expression plasmid produces a single copy of 847A transcript, however, during construction 
an identical, duplicate 847A sequence was incorporated into the expression plasmid that lacks the 
necessary upstream components to be expressed.  
The 847B expression plasmid is a dual expression plasmid that contains two individual but identical 
847B transgenes and both transgenes are expressed during production of the antigen. 
No raw materials of animal origin were used in the development of the production cell lines.  
Testing of the 847A and 847B MCB, WCB and end of production testing at the proposed limit of in vitro 
cell age (LIVCA EOPs) were carried out in line with ICH Q5A and Q5D. The information provided 
support that the genetic stability of the 847A and 847B cell substrates are maintained throughout the 
manufacturing process. Adventitious agent test results on the 847A and 847B MCB, WCB and LIVCA 
EOP were provided. Sufficient evidence that the methods used for screening cell banks for viral 
adventitious agents are suitably qualified for their intended purpose has been provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical and non-critical process parameters associated with the manufacturing process of 847A and 
847B antigens have been provided, and each parameter has been assigned a criticality status based on 
design of experiments’ (DOE) analysis discussed in Module 3. In addition to process parameters, 
information is provided on in-process tests for control (IPT-C) that are carried out to ensure quality of 
the AS is maintained. Maximum cell age in the production bioreactor was identified as a critical 
Assessment report

material attribute (CMA) that could impact quality of the AS and controls have been included for this 
CMA. The process parameters, IPT-Cs and CMA collectively provide control over the quality of the AS 
manufacturing process. In-process tests for monitoring (IPT-M) attributes have been included and 
several attributes are monitored regularly throughout the process. The dossier states that events 
where controls are outside of the specified ranges, an evaluation of the deviation is performed and any 
subsequent decision will be based on the outcome of an investigation.  
A high-level overview of the test methods used for the in-process tests and validation of these 
methods has also been provided in the dossier. Compendial methods used include Mycoplasma testing 
(Ph. Eur. 2.6.7), bioburden testing (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12) and endotoxin testing (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14). 
Hold times have been registered for each step.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
A standard approach to process validation has been taken (three commercial-scale batches for 847A 
and four commercial-scale batches 847B) following pre-approved protocols. The site of commercial 
manufacture for both 847A and 847B is Pfizer (formerly Wyeth BioPharma), Andover, Massachusetts, 
USA. All manufacturing steps registered in Module 3 for 847A and 847B have been validated.  
For the upstream process in both 847A and 847B, process validation results were provided. Results 
met their validation acceptance criteria, which included PPs, CPPs and IPT-Cs registered in Module 3. 
For downstream processes in both 847A and 847B, process validation results have been provided. All 
results for 847A and 847B met their validation acceptance criteria, and the validation acceptance 
criteria included PP ranges, CPP ranges and IPT-Cs that have been registered in Module 3. 
Impurity clearance 
The impurities identified during process validation, and their associated acceptance criteria for AS, are 
identical between 847A and 847B AS. The process and product related impurities have been discussed. 
These impurities were determined by risk assessment performed based on an in-silico evaluation, 
product dosing regimen and established risk factors. Acceptance criteria for validation of clearance are 
acceptable considering that a low dose final product is administered to the patient. HC DNA acceptance 
criteria aligns with the WHO recommendation of 10 ng/dose. Actual HC DNA data obtained is 
significantly below this. The process is suitable for clearance of identified impurities. 
Hold times 
Hold times were validated in small scale studies. Within the validation data provided for hold times, 
changes in quality attributes have been observed over the hold time tested at the harvest hold step, 
pre-final filter hold step and pre-freeze hold step. A retrospective analysis of GMP batches was 
performed to support the proposed hold times of the pre-final filter hold step and the pre-freeze hold 
step.  
Shipping validation  
The same shipping validation study was supplied to support shipping of both 847A and 847B.  
Resin and filter lifetime studies 
The number of cycles for each resin has been included in the dossier. 847A and 847B were used 
interchangeably to determine the total number of cycles for each resin. Therefore, the Process 
Validation provided supports both 847A and 847B processes. The data provided to support the 
proposed resin lifetimes are considered acceptable. The resin lifetime studies are ongoing according to 
the registered protocol. Membrane performance and lifetimes are also defined in the dossier. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 15/151 
 
 
 
Reprocessing 
The reprocessing validation provided is common to both 847A and 847B. Data provided in the dossier 
demonstrated no significant change in quality between pre- and post-reprocessing at small scale. No 
commercial scale reprocessing has been performed thus far. Testing will be carried out when a 
reprocessing event occurs. The predefined acceptance criteria for validation of commercial scale 
reprocessing have been registered in the dossier and are considered acceptable. 
Quality Attributes 
Critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the 847A AS and 847B AS were determined based on the quality 
target product profile of the FP and the quality attribute’s potential to impact safety or efficacy of the 
FP. Clarity, colouration, pH, protein concentration, identity, bioburden, endotoxin, relative prefusion 
content, impurity content, purity and CHO host cell proteins (HCP) are included in the specifications. 
The rationale for assigning criticality to the attributes is provided in the dossier and is acceptable. The 
applicant states that CHO DNA was not listed as a CQA as it is effectively cleared during purification. It 
was considered acceptable to exclude routine HC DNA testing based on the clearance data provided. 
Process Characterisation Studies 
The approach adopted by the applicant uses ‘cause and effect matrices’ (C&E) to determine if the unit 
operation requires further investigation. If it is determined that further investigation is required, small 
scale studies are used to determine whether the process parameters within a unit operation are critical 
or non-critical. Criticality was determined by studying statistically significant changes to relevant AS 
quality attributes caused by altering process parameters across a range. A statistically significant 
change in one quality attribute determined that parameter to be a critical process parameter which will 
be controlled within the proven acceptable range (PAR). Unit operations that do not need further 
investigation based on C&E are listed as non-CPP and are assigned normal operating ranges (NOR) 
based on what the applicant terms ‘relevant process history’ (RPH), manufacturing experience and 
subject matter expert judgement.  
The approach to determine CPPs was common to 847A and 847B. Process parameter ranges of the 
thaw, seed expansion, and harvest steps were assigned NORs using a Prior Knowledge approach. 
Given that the active substance is not produced until the production bioreactor stage, it is considered 
acceptable to base the ranges on process knowledge. An initial C&E risk assessment and One-factor-
at-a-time (OFAT) experiments were used to identify the process parameters for further study and ten 
process parameters were identified. The ten process parameters were then studied in a DOE. Only a 
high-level summary of the DOE is provided. The experimental results of DOE were not provided, such 
as prediction profiles, contour plots etc. or the statistical approach to determine significance. However, 
since a conservative approach was used, further details of the DOE are not requested. The 
characterisation studies and identified CPPs/non-CPPs associated with the upstream process are 
acceptable. 
The strategy used to assign CPPs for downstream unit operations for 847A and 847B was the same as 
the upstream strategy described previously, with the same AS quality attributes used for testing. The 
C&E identified at least one process parameter requiring investigation in each step of the downstream 
processing, and those parameters were investigated with small-scale studies. Again, process 
parameters that had no impact on AS quality over the ranges tested were assigned as non-CPPs and 
parameters that caused a statistically significant impact on the quality of the AS were classed as CPPs. 
Small-scale studies found a statistically significant impact on certain  parameters; however, 
justification was provided to list these parameters as non-CPP as while their impact was statistically 
significant, the magnitude of the effect was deemed to be small.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 16/151 
 
 
 
 
Hold times are defined. The process characterisation studies for the downstream process are 
extensive. Overall, the approach and CPPs assigned are acceptable based on the information provided. 
Control Strategy 
The Control strategy is identical for 847A and 847B. The applicant has provided a comprehensive 
overview of the control strategy associated with 847A DS and 847B DS. The control strategy is in line 
with an enhanced approach to manufacturing process development as outlined in ICH Q11. The control 
strategy has been divided into eight elements (listed above in the report) that will adequately control 
the process performance attributes and ensure that the 847A DS and 847B DS consistently meets the 
critical quality attributes. The list of DS attributes, the control implemented for each, the control 
element and supporting data has been provided in the dossier in tabulated form. Overall, the proposed 
control strategy is acceptable to ensure the quality of 847A DS and 847B DS. 
Manufacturing process development 
Development history of 847A and 847B is provided with clear chronological description that describes 
the significant changes that occurred over three process changes. The development history also lists 
the intended use for each manufactured batch.  
The development history has provided information on the changes made between each process. 
Comparative tables and summaries of these changes have been provided. The changes were 
introduced to both 847A and 847B processes, therefore both processes remained largely aligned 
throughout development. 
Comparability 
The batches of 847A and 847B used in clinical development are clearly listed in the dossier. Two 
comparability studies have been provided for each 847A and 847B DS development history, one 
comparing Process 1 to Process 2 and the second comparing Process 2 to Process 3. The comparability 
studies include comparison of release specification and heightened characterisation studies (primary 
structure, disulfide bond, molecular mass, secondary structure and tertiary structure).  
Following a request for appropriate comparability criteria, the applicant adopted an approach of using 
Process 3, i.e. the post-change batches, to generate appropriate comparability criteria and 
demonstrated that the Process 2 batches met the comparability acceptance criteria. Comparability has 
been demonstrated between Process 2 and Process 3. 
Extended characterisation used the reference material, from Process 2 and Process 3 from each of 
847A and 847B to demonstrate comparability. This is considered acceptable for extended 
characterisation. Overall, results of the extended characterisation comparability study support that the 
quality of 847A and 847B manufactured with Process 2 and Process 3 is comparable. 
In-Process extractables and leachables 
A risk assessment was performed, addressing relevant factors, and each contact material was assigned 
a relative risk factor (RRF). Appropriate justifications were provided for identified materials that were 
subsequently omitted from the extractables testing. The remaining parts that received a higher risk 
score were assessed for extractables. No part tested above the analytical evaluation threshold (AET) 
and as a result, the risk as regards extractables can be considered as negligible.  
Risk Assessment of Process Reagent Impurities 
The applicant has identified three process reagent impurities. Upon request, the dossier has been 
updated to include the maximum allowable levels of two of those impurities. Furthermore, the 
maximum concentration of one of these impurities has been registered in the dossier. Taken together, 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 17/151 
 
 
 
the residual amounts of the three process reagents are adequately controlled. The maximum levels of 
each process related impurity are the same across the 847A and 847B manufacturing process, 
therefore, it is agreed that 847A does represent a worst case scenario for the calculation of impurity 
levels. 
A risk assessment has been carried out to evaluate whether any impurity exceeds the safety concern 
threshold based on worst-case scenario AS production, a 1000-fold safety factor, a 70 kg person for 
calculation and an assumption of no process-related clearance of the impurity. As the indication is for 
pregnant females or elderly individuals, a 70 kg assumption could be too high. However, as the safety 
clearance threshold is exceeded for all potential impurities, in addition to an assumption of no 
clearance of impurities during downstream processing, this is not further pursued.  
Characterisation 
847A and 847B can exist in two conformations, prefusion and post-fusion conformations. Vaccination 
has the highest efficacy when targeted against the prefusion conformation and this AS is intended to 
generate neutralising antibodies specifically against the prefusion conformation. The characterisation 
carried out of the AS includes evaluation of the primary structure, post-translational modifications, N-
linked oligosaccharides, molecular mass, higher order structure, size variants and prefusion F content. 
Characterisation for both 847A and 847B was carried out with either the reference material or the 
parent batch from which the reference material was derived. The characterisation strategy is identical 
for both active substances and the studies are adequate to characterise 847A and 847B. Initially, data 
on only a single batch were provided for each of 847A and 847B. Data from additional batches (10 
batches of 847A and 11 batches of 847B) have been provided upon request to support 
characterisation. The batches presented in Module 3 (847A and 847B) can be considered 
representative of AS manufactured using the commercial process.  
A photostability study was carried out in line with ICH Q1B, indicating that 847A and 847B are 
photolabile.  
A similar impurity profile is observed for both 847A and 847B. The impurities identified include process 
related impurities, product related impurities and contaminants, including HCP, HC DNA, bioburden and 
endotoxin. Overall, the impurities have been adequately discussed and the purification process shows 
consistent and effective removal of the identified impurities. The specified impurities were present in 
material used in clinical trials.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The proposed specifications for 847A AS and 847B AS include appropriate specifications for identity, 
potency, purity, physicochemical attributes (clarity; colouration; pH) and microbiological properties 
(bioburden and endotoxin).  
Adequate justification was provided for the specification acceptance criteria for each quality attribute 
listed in the specifications. The proposed AS specifications have been determined from several 
production batches of 847A and several batches of 847B using statistical analysis of release data, 
stability data, product knowledge, development studies and compendial requirements. 
Analytical procedures  
The analytical methods have been sufficiently well described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with ICH Q2(R1). The analytical procedures used in the control of 847A and 847B are standard 
procedures for recombinant proteins. Appearance (clarity, colouration), pH, bioburden and endotoxin 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 18/151 
 
 
 
are compendial methods used and are described in Ph. Eur. 2.2.2, Ph. Eur. 2.2.3, Ph. Eur. 2.6.12 and 
Ph. Eur. 2.6.14 respectively.  
The remaining tests (protein concentration, identity, potency, impurity content, purity and CHO HCP 
testing) are non-compendial and common between 847A and 847B AS. A high-level overview of non-
compendial methods has been provided but the level of detail is sufficient.  
Batch analysis 
To date, several batches of 847A AS have been manufactured during development as reported in 
Module 3, however in this section, data is only provided on fewer batches (including the three process 
validation batches). For 847B, it has been reported in Module 3 that several batches of 847B have 
been manufactured to date, however in this section, data has only been provided for fewer batches 
(including four process validation batches). Of these batches presented, several 847A AS batches have 
been manufactured at commercial scale and several 847B AS batches have been manufactured at 
commercial scale. The MAH has provided justification for the exclusion of additional batches as they 
were either non-GMP batches or were batches produced to evaluate process changes or gain process 
understanding. 
All batches, across the three processes, met the pre-defined acceptance criteria in place at the time of 
testing. There were no trends observed. Overall, the results for purity, impurities and potency are 
consistent throughout development and the information provided is acceptable.  
Reference standards 
All reference materials used to date have been registered in the dossier. Throughout 847A 
development, there have been four clinical reference materials (CRM), a primary reference material 
(PRM) and a working reference material (WRM). For 847B, there have been three CRMs, one PRM and 
one WRM.  
Extended characterisation has been performed on the 847A CRM, 20J156M003 (DT4295) and the 847B 
CRM 20J157M003-FP8067-847B, with data provided. Parent batches used in the generation of the 
847A and 847B PRM and WRM were also included in the extended characterisation and comparability 
studies. 
The MAH has confirmed that if a new PRM is required, it will be introduced by variation to the MAA. 
Container closure 
The proposed container closure for 847A and 847B AS is an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) container with 
a nominal volume of 8.3 L. The choice of material is suitably justified and is supported by 
pharmacopoeial compliance of materials and stability data. Specifications and extractables/leachables 
studies are addressed. It has been stated that the product contact layer, ethylene vinyl acetate 
monomaterial (EVAM), properties have been tested and are in compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.1.7.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
The stability programme is designed to follow ICH guidelines for stability of active substance (ICH 
Guideline Q1A: Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products; ICH Guideline Q5C: Quality of 
Biotechnological Products, Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products). The stability 
indicating properties identified in Module 3 have been defined and are included in the stability testing 
panel. 
Primary stability studies are ongoing with active substance manufactured using the commercial 
process. These studies include at least three commercial-scale process validation batches of both 847A 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 19/151 
 
 
 
and 847B AS. Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend in the ongoing 
studies, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The 847A AS shelf life is supported by real time stability data up to 24 months and up to 9 months 
when stored at -40°C ± 10°C and stored in commercially registered containers. The 847B AS shelf life 
is supported with real time stability data up to 24 months, and up to 6 months when stored at -40°C ± 
10°C in commercially registered containers.  
Accelerated studies at 5°C ± 3°C are completed for 847A and 847B with 6 months of data.  
Stressed studies at 25°C ± 2°C/60 ± 5% are available. Thermal cycling studies have been provided to 
support that temporary excursions from the proposed storage conditions do not have an impact upon 
quality attributes. A photostability study in line with ICH Q1B (option 2) demonstrated that the product 
is photolabile.  
The provided stability data are considered sufficient to support the claimed shelf life for both 847A and 
847B AS. 
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.4.3.1.  Lyophilised powder  
2.4.3.1.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description of the product 
The finished product (FP) is a sterile lyophilised powder for injection that consists of equal amounts of 
two stabilised active substance antigens, 847A and 847B. The lyophilised finished product is presented 
in a 2 mL clear glass vial sealed with a stopper and an aluminium overseal with flip-off plastic cap. 
The finished product presentation has a target strength of 120 µg/vial; it is designed to deliver a 60 µg 
dose of each prefusion protein, equivalent to 120 µg dose of total protein in a 0.5 mL injection. There 
is no manufacturing overage.  
The finished product contains no preservatives and is single use. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards except for Tris 
hydrochloride which is controlled to an in-house specification. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. After reconstitution, the finished product contains trometamol, 
trometamol hydrochloride, sucrose, mannitol, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, hydrochloric acid (for 
pH adjustment) and water for injections. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The applicant has based their formulation development on a Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP). The 
formulation development for the AS and FP is well described. Early studies suggested that a liquid FP 
formulation would not provide sufficient stability at 2-8°C, the typical storage temperature for a 
vaccine; therefore, a lyophilised dosage form was the focus for FP development. The rationale and 
studies employed to determine the use and concentration of the buffers and stabilises are clearly 
presented. 
The manufacturing process development history, from formulation development through clinical 
development and onto commercial development has been presented. There have been three distinct FP 
processes through development. Comparability has been demonstrated.

Process development and characterisation studies have been presented for each unit operation of the 
finished product manufacturing process. Risk assessment was used to identify process parameters that 
required evaluation and the experimental plan, parameters and QAs evaluated are clearly outlined.  
The process characterisation studies are considered to address the relevant process parameters and 
include a comprehensive description of the development of the lyophilisation cycle which included 
thermal analysis of the finished product formulation, lab and pilot scale to commercial scale 
lyophilisation cycle development, lyophilisation process robustness and lyophiliser load uniformity for 
the commercial scale freeze dryers.  
The container closure development is adequately described (see container closure section).  
The choice of the container closure is justified in Module 3, considering the physical/chemical 
properties of the product, extractable and leachable studies, microbiological attributes and stability 
data.  
2.4.3.1.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Manufacture and batch release are conducted by Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium N.V. (Pfizer Puurs). 
Batch release is also conducted by Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals (Pfizer Grange Castle). Appropriate 
GMP authorisations are provided for all sites involved in the manufacture of the finished product.  
The target finished product batch size is defined. The manufacturing process of finished product (FP) 
includes active substance thawing, buffer and bulk finished product formulation, sterile filtration, 
aseptic filling, lyophilisation, capping and inspection. The bulk finished product can be stored or 
transferred directly to the filling line. At the filling line, the bulk finished product is filtered and 
aseptically filled into vials. Each filled vial is partially stoppered prior to lyophilisation. Upon completion 
of the lyophilisation cycle, the vials are fully stoppered and then capped and stored at 2-8°C before 
inspection. The description of the manufacturing process is clear and detailed. Relevant process 
parameters and in process tests (IPTs) are detailed with set points or ranges.  
Reprocessing is proposed if the bioburden reducing filter fails to meet the post-use integrity test 
criteria, or in the event of a technical issue that compromises the integrity of the system. It is 
proposed that the bulk finished product may be reprocessed once into a holding vessel using a new 
and identical 0.2 μm bioburden reducing filter. This is accepted. 
Process controls 
The process controls include a combination of critical material attributes (CMA), critical process 
parameters (CPP), non-critical process parameters (non-CPP), and in-process tests for control (IPT-C) 
and monitoring (IPT-M). The proposed ranges and acceptance criteria are supported by pharmaceutical 
development and validation data and are acceptable. The applicant clarified that in the event that 
results are outside of the acceptable ranges process parameters or in process tests, the quality 
procedures at the manufacturing site do not differentiate between deviations to CPPs, non-CPPs, IPT-
Ms or IPT-Cs in their investigation approach. Proposed hold times are supported by media fill and in-
process hold time validation. 
Process validation  
Process validation studies included validation of the manufacturing process, hold times, the aseptic 
filling process, filter validation, reprocessing validation, capping validation and shipping validation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023

Three consecutive successful process validation lots met the pre-determined protocol acceptance 
criteria for the study demonstrating that the finished product manufacturing process, executed within 
established operating parameters, consistently produces finished product that meets its pre-
determined quality attributes. The lots were manufactured at the intended commercial scale. All the 
registered process parameters and IPCs listed in Module 3 were appropriately validated in these 
campaigns. Where process parameter ranges have been set, they have been challenged in the process 
validation studies. Maximum hold times were also validated. 
Post manufacture of the finished product process validation lots, a confirmatory validation study was 
performed to support post-validation changes. 
The aseptic process was validated by representative media fills. 
Shipping was validated. The simulated study represents the worst case scenario for actual shipping 
conditions. 
A concurrent validation approach for reprocessing is proposed in cases where the bioburden reduction 
filter fails to meet the post-use integrity test, or if a technical issue occurs that compromises the 
integrity of the system. A validation protocol was provided. This is accepted. 
2.4.3.1.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The specification of the finished product includes tests for appearance (before reconstitution), residual 
moisture, reconstitution time, clarity, and colouration (after reconstitution), visible and subvisible 
particles, pH, osmolality, protein concentration, 847A and 847B content, uniformity of dosage units 
polysorbate 80 (PS80) concentration, identity, relative prefusion content (potency), product-related 
impurities, endotoxins, sterility and container closure integrity. 
Testing for FP is in compliance with the relevant requirements of ICH Q6B and Ph. Eur. Monographs for 
Products of Recombinant DNA Technology (0784), Vaccines for Human Use (0153) and Parenteral 
Preparations (0520). 
The tests performed for stability assessment are indicated. The same acceptance criteria are applied to 
tests performed on release and stability. The approach to stability testing is mainly acceptable as those 
tests not performed are not stability indicating.  
Finished Product Specification 
The applicant was requested to review the acceptance criteria for several parameters The acceptance 
criteria for the specifications have now been appropriately justified.  
A nitrosamine risk assessment has been conducted and is provided in Module 3. No risk for nitrosamine 
formation was identified. A satisfactory summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities in 
accordance with ICH Q3D was provided. 
Analytical procedures  
Residual moisture, appearance after reconstitution, pH and osmolality, uniformity of dosage units and 
endotoxins are tested according to Ph. Eur. methods. In house methods are detailed.  
Sufficient information is provided on compendial and non-compendial methods. In house methods 
include detail on procedural steps, sample and reference standard preparation, replicates, system

suitability, acceptance criteria and calculations as relevant. All methods have been appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH Q2(R1). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data has been provided for several “parent batches” of finished product including three 
process validation lots. The batches were either batches intended for clinical use but not used, stability 
batches, process validation batches or confirmatory batches. The batch data were all within the 
proposed specifications and show that the manufacturing process can produce a finished product of 
consistent quality. 
Reference materials 
Throughout development, there have been several reference standards; clinical reference materials 
(CRM), a primary reference material (PRM) and a working reference material (WRM). The approach to 
establishing FP RMs is similar to the approach adopted for AS RMs.  
Multiple issues related to qualification, consistency across the different lots, and stability of the CRM 
used for release testing of clinical and PPQ lots were identified. These issues potentially impacted the 
comparability assessment for RSVpreF FP manufactured during the different development stages. This 
was raised as a Major Objection (MO). From the information provided in the response it could be 
concluded that CRMs were suitable for their intended use and enable consistent attribute determination 
over time and across lots. Data was also provided to demonstrate that primary reference standard has 
been appropriately bridged to the clinical reference standard. The MO was resolved.  
Appropriate bridging data was provided for the initial clinical reference standards. Bridging data was 
also provided between the clinical reference standard and primary reference standard. 
Container closure 
The primary container closure system clear and colourless Type I borosilicate glass or, alternatively, 
aluminosilicate glass vials, with a 2 ml fill volume and a 13 mm crown diameter. Vials are stoppered 
with synthetic chlorobutyl rubber stoppers and sealed with an aluminium vial seal with polypropylene 
flip of caps. Compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1, for vials, and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9, for stoppers, is declared. The 
name and address of manufacturers, dimensions, representatively schematic drawings and quality 
control tests are provided for the vials, stoppers and seals. 
Sterilisation and depyrogenation of the vials by dry heat and steam sterilisation of stoppers, is detailed 
in Module 3. 
2.4.3.1.4.  Stability of the product 
A finished product shelf-life of 24 months when stored at the recommended temperature of 2-8°C is 
proposed. 
Stability has been studied under long-term conditions (5 ± 3°C), accelerated conditions of (30 ± 
2°C/65 ± 5% relative humidity (RH)), as well as thermal stress, thermal cycling and photostability 
conditions. Stability studies have been carried out in accordance with current ICH guidelines for 
stability of finished product. The containers used in the stability studies are the same as those 
proposed for routine storage, and both the proposed borosilicate and aluminosilicate glass vials have 
been used in the stability studies. 
Results from stability studies on finished product stored at the long-term condition of 5 ± 3°C are 
presented for several primary lots and several supportive lots. This includes three process validation 
lots. All data remained within the proposed commercial stability acceptance criteria and there have 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 23/151 
 
 
 
been no significant changes in terms of quality for the finished product. Results from stability studies 
on finished product stored at the accelerated condition of 30 ± 2°C/ 65 ± 5% RH are presented for 
several primary lots; and at 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH for several primary and supportive lots. Currently 
there is up to 6 months of data available for primary and supportive stability lots. Slight increase in 
product-related impurities was observed on some lots. Residual moisture is also observed to increase 
slightly. All results generated to date remained within the proposed commercial stability acceptance 
criteria and there have been no significant changes in terms of quality for the finished product. 
Results from stability studies on finished product stored at the thermal stress condition of 40 ± 2°C/75 
± 5% RH are presented for several primary lots and several supportive lots. 1 month data is available 
for all lots. Increases in moisture, protein concentration and changes in product-related impurities 
were seen in some of the lots, but all results remained well within the proposed commercial stability 
acceptance criteria and no significant changes were observed.  
The accelerated studies up to 30 ± 2°C/ 65 ± 5% RH showed stability up to 6 months. The thermal 
stressed studies investigated excursions above the recommended storage condition up to 40 ± 2°C/75 
± 5% RH and demonstrated stability up to 1 month. 
However, although accelerated and thermal stressed stability studies demonstrate stability at 
excursions beyond 2-8°C, the product information states and therefore permits only the following: 
The unopened vial is stable for 5 days when stored at temperatures from 8°C to 30°C. At the end of 
this period Abrysvo should be used or discarded. This information is used to guide healthcare 
professionals in case of temporary temperature excursions only. 
Data from thermal cycling studies where the finished product is stored at 30 ± 2°C/65 ± 5% RH for 
two months followed by long-term storage at 5 ± 3°C (Thermal Cycling 2), with 12 months of data 
currently available, supports the time out of refrigeration during the manufacturing, assembly, 
labelling, packaging and shipping of the product. 
The in-use period in the Product information, after reconstitution, 4 hours at 15°C to 30°C, is 
supported by pharmaceutical development data. Photostability studies demonstrate the finished 
product is not photolabile. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products 
in the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should 
be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The results of the stability studies support the finished product shelf-life claim of 24 months when 
stored at the recommended temperature of 2-8°C.  
2.4.3.2.  Solvent - Water for Injection 
2.4.3.2.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The water for injection solvent complies with Ph.Eur. and is presented in a pre-filled syringe. The 
target fill volume includes an overfill which ensures a nominal injection volume of 0.5 ml. The solvent 
is filled into a type I borosilicate glass syringe with Luer lock adapter, plunger and tip cap with cap 
cover. The elastomeric tip cap that is the product contact surface meets the requirements of USP 
<381> and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 and is not manufactured from natural rubber latex. The closure for the 
syringes is a plunger stopper composed of chlorobutyl rubber that is not made with natural rubber 
latex. The final assembled vaccine consists of a finished product vial, a sterile water diluent syringe,

and a vial adapter in a secondary packaged kit. In addition, a needle can be included in the packaging. 
See container closure section. 
CE certificates are provided for the co-packaged vial adaptor and needle. The applicant provided 
evidence of compliance of the PFS with the relevant GSPRs.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The selection of sterile water as a solvent for the finished product is supported by clinical development. 
The sterile water solvent was selected based on safety and immunogenicity data from both phase 1/2 
and phase 2 studies and was the sole solvent utilised in the phase 3 clinical study. The studies 
conducted by the applicant support the fill weight target and fill weight check acceptance criteria and 
demonstrate the required volume of injection (≥0.5 ml) could be delivered even at worst case 
conditions.  
The process control strategy includes the relevant controls on filling, filtration, and sterilisation 
parameters. The parameter choices are either justified by, development work, process validation or 
reference conditions of the Ph. Eur. with respect to terminal sterilisation parameters. The finished 
product specification release and stability acceptance criteria are based on compendial requirements 
for sterile water. 
2.4.3.2.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Pfizer Manufacturing Belgium NV (Pfizer Puurs) performs manufacture, testing, primary packaging, 
secondary Packaging, QA rlease of the diluent. Appropriate GMP authorisation is in place. The batch 
size range has been defined. 
The manufacturing process consists of the filtration of water for injection (WFI) and WFI bulk is then 
filled into syringes, the plunger is added to the syringe and the syringe is terminally sterilised by steam 
sterilisation in an autoclave according to a cycle conforming to Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 conditions. Detail of the 
inspection, vaccine kit assembly at both proposed secondary packaging sites and shipping to 
distribution centres are also described.  
Details of the control of the process via critical and non-critical parameters, IPT-C and IPT-M tests are 
also provided. Parameter ranges have been demonstrated to be acceptable through process 
development and/or process validation. In process tests are carried out The bioburden tests have been 
suitably verified. The ambient bioburden control limit prior to sterilisation (≤100 CFU/100 mL) is in line 
with the EMA Guideline on sterilisation of the medicinal product for processes applying a Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 
steam sterilisation reference cycle. 
The manufacturing process and controls are adequately described. Manufacturing process validation 
has been successfully conducted on three consecutive lots. A summary is provided of the validation of 
the terminal sterilisation process. The steam sterilisation cycle uses Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 reference cycle i.e. a 
sterilisation time of ≥15 mins at a sterilisation temperature of ≥121°C is specified in Module 3. As per 
the EMA Guideline on sterilisation of the medicinal product for sterilisation using a reference condition 
of the Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 (≥121°C, ≥15 min in all units) validation data for the sterilisation cycle is not 
required to be submitted in the quality dossier. None the less, a validation summary is presented. 
Process hold times have been validated based on the shortest hold times per process step of each of 
the three validation batches. Labelling, packaging and shipping have been suitably qualified.

2.4.3.2.3.  Product specification 
The solvent specification includes tests for appearance, subvisible particles, conductivity, total organic 
carbon, oxidisable substance, residue on evaporation, extractable volume, endotoxin, sterility and 
container closure integrity.  
The same acceptance criteria are applied to both release and stability. 
The proposed specification is in line with Ph. Eur. (0169: Sterilised Water for Injections) version 11.1.  
Analytical methods 
Reference is made to compendial monographs in lieu of a description for the relevant analytical 
procedures. 
It is stated that compendial procedures were verified or validated for use in accordance with the 
applicable pharmacopoeias, unless otherwise justified.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis is presented for several batches of the sterile water solvent, including the three process 
validation lots manufactured in the commercial scale range. All batches met the acceptance criteria at 
the time of release, although the non-process validation lots were only tested for certain attributes.  
The specification is considered justified as it is aligned with Ph. Eur. (0169: Sterilised Water for 
Injections) monograph.  
Reference materials 
There is no reference material required for sterile water diluent. 
Container closure 
Compliance with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1, for syringe barrels, and Ph. Eur. 3.2.9, for the product contact tip cap 
elastomer and plunger stoppers, is declared.  
The syringes and plunger stoppers are received at the finished product manufacturing site ready-to-
use, washed, siliconised, and sterilised. Compliance with ISO 11135-1, CPMP/QWP/159/01 and ISO 
10993-7 is declared. Compliance with ISO 11137-2 is declared. 
The name and address of manufacture and sterilisation sites, dimensions, representatively schematic 
drawings, and quality control tests are provided for the syringes and plunger stoppers. 
The choice of the container closure is justified in Module 3, considering the physical/chemical 
properties of the product, extractable and leachable studies, microbiological attributes and stability 
data. 
2.4.3.2.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life is 36 months when stored at 2 - 32°C based on extrapolation of the available 
data in line with ICH Q1E.  
The stability programme is line with ICH Q1A (R2): Stability Testing of New Active substances and 
Products. 
Stability studies have been conducted at long term (5 ± 3°C and 25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH or 30 ± 
2°C/65 ± 5% RH), accelerated 40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5% RH), thermal stress (50 ± 2°C), thermal cycling 
conditions and photostability.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 26/151 
 
 
 
Several sterile water solvent lots are included in the primary stability studies, The accelerated studies 
are complete for all primary stability lots with 6 months data available. Thermal stress studies are also 
complete with 2 weeks data available from 4 clinical lots. Photostability has been completed on one 
clinical lot. Thermal cycling studies are ongoing. 
Analytical procedures utilised in the stability studies are in line with those described in Module 3. All 
parameters met the proposed commercial stability specification where there have been no significant 
changes observed in any parameter. The data presented supports the proposed shelf life at the 
intended storage conditions. The extrapolation of the data to the proposed shelf life is considered 
reasonable considering the available long term and accelerated data. 
2.4.3.3.  Adventitious agents 
The applicant has identified materials of animal origin used during the manufacture of 847A and 847B 
that includes filters, flasks, tubing and flexible containers. The applicant states that the materials 
manufactured with components derived from animal origin meet the requirements of EMA/410/01 and 
this is acceptable.  
Testing has been performed to demonstrate that 847A and 847B unprocessed bulk are free from 
adventitious agents. MCB, WCB and LIVCA testing for adventitious agents has been provided in Module 
3 and all cell line material tested negative for adventitious agents. Testing of unprocessed bulk for 
mycoplasma, bioburden and viral agents has been provided for  batches of 847A and 
847B.Unprocessed bulk for 847A and 847B showed absence of mycoplasma, bioburden and viral 
agents.  
Viral clearance of the purification process was also evaluated. The rationale for the choice of viruses 
used in the evaluation has been provided and is acceptable. Viral clearance validation reports have 
been provided that demonstrate no toxicity or interference and that they are suitably qualified for their 
intended purpose. 
Overall, the results of the viral clearance studies demonstrated the manufacturing process has 
sufficient capacity to remove viruses. 
Retrovirus-like particles (RVLP) were quantified Based on the viral clearance studies, the retrovirus 
safety margins are acceptable for both 847A and 847B. 
2.4.3.4.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Module 3 of the Abrysvo dossier is of good quality. The 847A and 847B active substance manufacturing 
processes are standard production of recombinant proteins in CHO cells. Details of developmental 
genetics, the generation of cell banks, characterisation control strategy, commercial scale process 
validation, specifications, analytical methods, container closure and shelf-life are provided, and 
information is described in adequate detail. Overall, the quality of the 847A and 847B active 
substances is considered acceptable.  
For the finished product (FP), the description of the product, pharmaceutical development, 
manufacturing process controls, control of the product, container closure and stability information are 
clearly described in adequate detail for both the lyophilised finished product and sterile water solvent.  
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 27/151 
 
 
 
An MO was raised on the FP reference standard. Multiple issues related to qualification, consistency 
across the different lots, and stability of the CRM used for release testing of clinical and PPQ lots were 
identified. These issues potentially impacted the comparability assessment for RSVpreF FP 
manufactured during the different development stages. From the information provided in the response 
it could be concluded that both CRMs were suitable for their intended use and enable consistent 
attribute determination over time and across lots. Data was also provided to demonstrate that the 
primary reference standard has been appropriately bridged to the clinical reference standard. The MO 
was resolved. 
An MO was also raised on the new active substance claim since differences in the basis structural 
element of Abrysvo and Arexvy (already licensed on the EU market) were identified but had not been 
justified as being substantial.  
Subsequently, further information was provided. As the RSV, subgroup B, stabilised prefusion F protein 
(847B) active substance is derived from a different RSV strain than is present in Arexvy, it can be 
considered as a new active substance in line with EMA/CHMP/CMDh/CAT/BWP/828612/2022. 
For the 847A active substance, the applicant highlighted amino acid differences that represent 
substantial modification to the basic structural element, contributing to improved thermal/chemical 
stability and higher neutralising antibody responses. This justification is considered sufficient to accept 
that 847A is a new active substance. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
N/A 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Pharmacology 
The two major glycoproteins on the surface of the RSV virion are the attachment glycoprotein (G) and 
the fusion glycoprotein (F). RSV F is a primary target for vaccine-induced protection as it is required 
for fusion and entry of RSV into host cells. The trimeric RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a primary target 
of neutralizing antibodies elicited by RSV infection and is the basis for the engineered antigens in 
Pfizer’s RSV vaccine candidate. RSV F is a molecular device that fuses the viral and host cell 
membranes during cell entry. It exists in two key, antigenically distinct forms - prefusion and 
postfusion. 
F has long been a key antigen for RSV vaccine development. Prefusion F is the primary form 
recognised by neutralizing antibodies in human serum (VR-VTR-10879). 
Many prefusion-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) target an antigenic site (site Ø) located at the 
apex of the globular domain of prefusion F. This epitope is disrupted during the rearrangement from 
prefusion to postfusion. Unlike postfusion F, prefusion F is the active form of the protein and is capable 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 28/151 
 
 
 
of mediating membrane fusion during cell entry. Therefore, prefusion F is the primary target of 
neutralizing antibodies that block RSV infection.  
Pharmacology studies performed demonstrated that prefusion F elicits higher titre neutralizing 
antibodies than postfusion F in experimental animals. 
Structure-guided protein engineering was used to design stabilised prefusion F constructs, (VR-VTR-
10914). Each soluble F construct is comprised of an RSV F ectodomain that was engineered through 
the addition several internal mutations, to “lock” the protein into its prefusion conformation. Each 
ectodomain contained a C-terminal T4 bacteriophage fibritin foldon trimerisation domain. Structural 
analysis, in silico protein design, and high throughput mutagenesis were used to generate novel F 
constructs. 
These constructs were tested in vitro for stability in the prefusion conformation under stress 
conditions, using reactivity with prefusion specific mAbs as the primary assay for prefusion 
conformation. Using in silico antigen design, constructs incorporated combinations of targeted protein 
engineering chemistries, including 1) engineered disulfide bond mutations, 2) cavity-filling mutations, 
and 3) electrostatic mutations. Disulfides were introduced to immobilise more flexible regions of 
prefusion F by tethering them to more rigid regions and prevent re-arrangement to the postfusion 
form. 
Combinations of these chemistries were examined in nearly 400 F protein constructs to identify the 
most stable prefusion F for preclinical immunogenicity testing. A selection of the most stable constructs 
identified through in vitro testing was evaluated for the ability to elicit RSV neutralizing antibodies in 
animal immunisation studies. 
This combination of in vitro conformational stability testing and animal immunogenicity testing was the 
basis for selecting the lead prefusion F vaccine antigen, 847. To make the stabilised prefusion F 
vaccine antigens for Pfizer’s RSVpreF investigational vaccine, the 847 stabilizing mutations, which were 
identified on the background of A2 (a standard laboratory RSV strain), were introduced into the 
background F sequences of two contemporary wild type RSV strains, Ontario for subgroup A (847A) 
and Buenos Aires for subgroup B (847B). 
The rationale for the bivalent vaccine is sound. Historically, RSV A was thought to cause most RSV 
disease. However, more extensive epidemiology studies have shown that either RSV A or RSV B 
subgroups can dominate in a season and can also be evenly distributed across seasons. Both are 
associated with severe disease and can co-circulate. 
Following the in vitro screening of F constructs for prefusion stability resulted in selection of 11 top 
candidates for in vivo immunogenicity evaluation. These top candidates were advanced into dose 
ranging immunogenicity studies in mice. From these studies, three of the most immunogenic 
candidates were selected for further preclinical immunogenicity evaluation in cotton rats.  
The stabilizing mutations of the most immunogenic of the selected constructs were introduced to F 
backgrounds from recently circulating RSV strains to generate the investigational vaccine antigens, 
847A and 847B. Preparations of 847A were confirmed to contain prefusion F by X-ray crystallography 
and electron cryomicroscopy with image reconstruction, (VR-VTR-10880). 
In vivo assessments of the RSV investigational vaccine 
Mice  
Several of the most stable novel prefusion F constructs were more immunogenic in mice compared to a 
wild-type postfusion F antigen, (VR-VTR-10385). Three prefusion F constructs, 847, 852, and 851, 
were consistently more immunogenic than DS-Cav1 as assessed by RSV 50% and 90% neutralizing 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 29/151 
 
 
 
titres. The 847, 852 and 851 vaccine candidates were prioritised for further preclinical immunogenicity 
testing in cotton rats. 
Cotton Rats  
Immunisation of cotton rats (VR-VTR-10386) showed a clear dose-dependent neutralizing antibody 
response to the novel prefusion constructs and identified the top vaccine candidate, construct 847, 
which elicited higher overall responses than DS-Cav1, 851, and 852, both with and without aluminium 
phosphate. 
A second study in cotton rats (VR-VTR-10387) evaluated the immunogenicity of a dose range of 
monovalent 847A strain (Ontario), monovalent B strain (Buenos Aires) and a bivalent 847A + 847B 
combination in cotton rats to determine if there is an added benefit to a bivalent formulation. 
Improved neutralizing antibody responses across RSV A and B viruses with a bivalent formulation 
(847A + 847B) was observed, compared to a monovalent 847A vaccine candidate.  
In both these rat studies palivizumab was used as a control, to serve as a potential threshold of 
protection. Palivizumab was dosed in rats at 15 mg/kg. A dose of 10 mg/kg has been demonstrated in 
the literature (Johnson, 1997) to confer near complete protection in the lungs of cotton rats. Protection 
in cotton rats corresponded to a serum antibody trough concentration at the time of challenge of ~ 30 
- 40 µg/ml.   In the pharmacology studies, a 15 mg/kg palivizumab dose was used as a more 
conservative dose to ensure maintenance at or above protective levels. 
Rhesus Macaques  
A study in rhesus macaques (VR-VTR-10388) evaluated the immunogenicity of a stabilised prefusion F 
protein candidate with and without aluminium hydroxide [Al(OH)3] as compared to the same dose 
levels of a postfusion F protein.  
Again, in this monkey study palivizumab was used as a control, to serve as a potential threshold of 
protection. The chosen 15 mg/kg palivizumab dose in monkeys, was not justified. It is not known if the 
desired serum concentration of ~ 30 - 40 μg/mL was achieved with the 15 mg/kg palivizumab in these 
animals. However, animals who were dosed with 60 µg of prefusion 847 elicited a similar 50% 
neutralising antibody titre to animals that received palivizumab. 
It was noted that all non-clinical PD studies – except the study in Rhesus Macaques (VR-VTR-10388), 
have been conducted in female animals. For the provided proof-of-concept (immunogenicity) studies, 
this is agreed. Potential gender differences with respect to induced immune responses, vaccine 
efficacy, etc. should be investigated in the human target population. The applicant was asked to 
explain why this immunogenicity study was performed in male monkeys. The reason for this was based 
on animal availability, and the approach generally taken in the CRO where the study was performed is 
to conduct immunogenicity studies in male animals. 
The neutralising activity of the RSV prefusion F vaccine was investigated using RSV laboratory and 
clinical strains (VR-VTR-10391). Immune sera from cotton rats (VTR-10938 /CR 2017-14) and rhesus 
macaques (Rh 2017-04) that received two doses of bivalent RSVpreF were further tested for their 
ability to neutralise recently circulating RSV A and RSV B clinical isolates. 
In this study the serum from adjuvanted vaccine treated rats and monkeys, and serum from non- 
adjuvanted vaccinated rats was used to demonstrate efficacy against circulating RSV strains. Serum 
from the adjuvant vaccine treated animals was better at neutralising RSV strains than non- 
adjuvanted.

Efficacy studies 
Two studies evaluating the vaccine antigens in various formulations were performed to assess safety, 
efficacy, immunogenicity, and risk for enhanced respiratory pathology in cotton rats. Cotton rats are 
100-fold more susceptible to RSV than mice and have been used for several decades for RSV vaccine 
efficacy and disease enhancement evaluation (Prince et al, 1999; Prince et al, 1978). 
In the first study (Evaluation of Safety, Efficacy and Immunogenicity of Candidate Vaccines in the RSV 
Cotton Rat Model, Study Number: VR-VTR-10390 / XV-154, (PRL-RSV-2016-06)), cotton rats were 
vaccinated IM at Days 0 and 28 with bivalent 847 (25 µg 847A + 25 µg 847B) with or without Al(OH)3, 
with the original FI-RSV Lot 100, or with PBS control. During the course of this animal study, three 
cotton rats, 109330 (group 8), 109317 (group 6) and 109300 (group 5) had medical incidents. The 
cotton rats found dead were considered unrelated to the administration of the RSV vaccines. All three 
animals showed no signs of injury, were well groomed, well-nourished and showed no signs of 
dehydration. Neither did the cotton rats have a history of malocclusion or showed signs of it when 
found dead. A full necropsy was performed and macroscopy did not show anything obvious. The 
applicant was asked to explain what the animal pathologist ultimately determined to be the cause of 
death. The applicant provided a table with observations described by the assigned CRO on the three 
animal deaths that occurred. The cause of death was not determined in the pathological evaluation, as 
stated in the observations provided by the in-life test facility. However, it was confirmed that no animal 
administered the RSVpreF vaccine candidate was affected by the incidents. 
A second study (VR-VTR-10938) was performed where cotton rats were vaccinated IM with 847A and 
847B alone (30 µg each; 60 µg total protein) either with Al(OH)3 (0.2 mg per dose) or with CpG 
24555/Al(OH)3 (0.1 mg/0.15 mg per dose). 
Efficacy studies in cotton rats demonstrated that the bivalent RSV 847 prefusion F vaccine candidate 
(RSVpreF) prevents RSV infection in cotton rats, does not induce enhanced respiratory pathology, and 
elicits potent RSV neutralizing antibodies, particularly when adsorbed to Al(OH)3. The studies measured 
alveolitis, but unfortunately did not measure markers of a Th2 response which is also associated with 
ERD. However, this product is indicated for adults and not intended at this point for RSV-naïve subjects 
or infant immunisation. Therefore, in line with EMA/CHMP/257022/2017 and WHO 2020, a preliminary 
assessment of the risk that vaccine-associated enhanced RSV disease could occur is not required. 
These studies both demonstrated that the bivalent vaccine prevents RSV infection in cotton rats (as 
detected by viral shedding), does not induce enhanced respiratory pathology, and elicits potent RSV 
neutralising antibodies. The second study, VR-VTR-10938, was conducted later when the planned 
study design for the first-in-human study (C3671001) was being established. The dose in the second 
study included a dose level representative of the lowest planned clinical dose of 60 µg (30 µg of each 
drug substance). 
No secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were 
performed. This is acceptable as these studies are generally not considered necessary to support the 
development and licensure of vaccines for infectious diseases (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014). 
The recombinant, bivalent, stabilised prefusion RSV F subunit vaccine candidate (RSVpreF) contains 
two F antigens, 847A from RSV subgroup A and 847B from subgroup B, present in equal amounts in a 
lyophilised dosage form for reconstitution. Based on clinical safety and immunogenicity data, the final 
formulation selected for pivotal efficacy studies was RSVpreF 120 μg without Al(OH)3, although 
complete protection in the upper airways of the Cotton Rat studies required inclusion of Al(OH)3 or CpG 
24555/Al(OH)3 with the bivalent 847 prefusion F vaccine candidate. 
In this sense, it is not clear whether the RSVpreF materials used in the non-clinical PD studies are 
sufficiently representative of the material used in the clinic and commercially. The applicant was asked 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 31/151 
 
 
 
to draw a plausible conclusion on the representativeness of the RSVpreF material used in the non-
clinical pharmacodynamic studies for the clinic. In response the applicant provided an adequate 
overview of the tested RSVpreF material used in the non-clinical PD studies, the corresponding DP and 
DS batch numbers, and the production methods/processes submitted originally in Module 3 of the MAA 
dossier. Equally, a plausible conclusion on the representativeness of the RSVpreF material (used in the 
non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies) for the clinical use was subsequently submitted.  
2.5.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated pharmacokinetics or ADME studies for RSVpreF have been performed. This is acceptable 
as such studies are not considered necessary for vaccine products (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014). 
2.5.3.  Toxicology 
RSVpreF were tested in a repeat-dose toxicity study in rats and in a combined fertility and pre- and 
postnatal developmental toxicity study in pregnant and lactating rabbits. In both studies, the vaccine 
formulations, with or without Al(OH)3, were administered IM (120 μg each of 847A and 847B, total of 
240 μg antigens) at 2x the selected clinical dose (total of 120 μg antigens). 
Repeat-dose administrations of RSVpreF (1 dose every 3 or 2 weeks) for a total of 3 doses to Wistar 
Han rats were tolerated without evidence of systemic toxicity and produced a functional antibody 
response and anticipated local inflammatory reaction. Non-adverse immune responses and/or 
inflammatory reactions were evident at the injection sites and draining lymph nodes, and clinical 
pathology changes, when present, were consistent with immune stimulation or inflammation at the 
injection sites. These findings were interpreted to be non-adverse because of limited severity, lack of 
systemic findings, and absence of clinical signs. RSVpreF-related changes in neutrophils, acute phase 
proteins, and albumin: globulin ratio as well as microscopic findings at the injection site and in the 
draining lymph nodes were consistent with those seen with administration of vaccines. All findings 
were typical of those observed with administration of other vaccines, including aluminium-containing 
vaccines. 
The applicant states that the Wistar Han rat was used as it is an immunologically relevant species as it 
develops a neutralizing antibody response to RSV antigens.  However, females in Group 3 administered 
RSVpreF without Al(OH)3 did not exhibit a functional antibody response to either RSV A or RSV B. 
Geometric mean titres identical to control groups, and below the LOD. Group 4 females responded to 
RSVpreF + Al(OH)3, demonstrating the capability to induce an immune response in female HW rats. 
Group 3 females did not respond to RSVpreF, either A or B component. The applicant was asked to 
explain the lack of a response in this group. In response the applicant provided procedural details from 
the study that demonstrate that control solution could not have been inadvertently administered to this 
group of female animals. In addition, Group 3 males clearly showed an immune response, excluding 
the possibility of being dosed with a control formulation, as these two groups were sequentially dosed. 
No deviations of dosing errors were noted. The lack of immune response to RSVpreF in female rats 
appears to be a true species-specific effect.  
The RSV B neutralisation assay is considered qualified for use in the detection of antibodies present in 
serum. Both assays were evaluated for performance parameters including assay precision, 
intermediate precision, and dilutional linearity using serum samples sourced from humans and various 
animal species, including the Wistar Han rat. The lack of response in female rats has been sufficiently 
explained. These assays were used to measure antibodies in Study AB22373 in which robust RSV B 
antibody responses were measured in female rabbits and were successfully used for early phase 
clinical testing as well.

EMA/351226/2023  
Page 32/151 
 
 
 
In a fertility, reproductive, and developmental study in NZW rabbits, following administration of 
RSVpreF with or without Al(OH)3 twice premating and twice during gestation (for a total of 4 doses), 
there were no indications of maternal systemic toxicity or effects on mating performance or fertility in 
female rabbits or on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the F1 offspring. 
Rabbits administered RSVpreF (both with and without Al(OH)3) elicited an immune response to RSV A 
and RSV B, and these responses were detectable in fetuses and kits from the caesarean and littering 
groups, respectively. At gestation day 29, fetuses had comparable RSV A and B titres in Group 3 
(clinical formulation without Al(OH)3). At PND 35, kit titres for RSV A and RSV B were approximately 5 
times lower than the maternal titres. 
Based on the nonclinical toxicity studies, findings related to IM administration of RSVpreF with or 
without Al(OH)3 were limited to nonadverse microscopic findings at the injection sites (chronic active 
inflammation) and the draining lymph nodes (increased cellularity of the germinal centres and 
accumulation of macrophages). Inflammatory changes at the injection site and increased germinal 
centre cellularity of the draining lymph node were consistent with findings typically observed with the 
IM administration of vaccines (especially aluminium-containing vaccines) and demonstrated evidence 
of reversibility. 
Although it was consistently demonstrated in the nonclinical studies that immune responses were 
higher in animals administered RSVpreF with Al(OH)3 compared with animals administered RSVpreF 
without Al(OH)3, the final formulation without Al(OH)3 was selected based on the safety and 
immunogenicity data from 2 Phase 1/2 studies (C3671001 and C3671002) and the efficacy evaluation 
in the human challenge study (WI257521). In studies C3671001 and C3671002, Al(OH)3 or 
CpG/Al(OH)3 did not notably enhance the immune response to RSVpreF. Therefore, based on clinical 
safety and immunogenicity data, the final formulation selected for pivotal efficacy studies was RSVpreF 
120 μg without Al(OH)3. 
In general, the toxicology studies are in line with the WHO Guidelines on the quality, safety and 
efficacy of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines (2020), supporting the dose level, dosing schedule and 
route of administration of RSVpreF to humans. 
2.5.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The absence of ERA studies for vaccines are justified according to the Guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), which states,  
“In the case of products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, 
carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should be provided. 
This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature 
they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. The same applies to vaccines 
and herbal medicinal products.” 
This product is both a vaccine and a protein. 
The statement provided by the applicant that due to the nature of its constituents an ERA is not 
required for this vaccine can be accepted, the statement has been signed and dated by the expert 
preparing it, and the CV of the expert is provided. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, RSVpreF is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment.

2.5.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Pharmacology studies performed demonstrated that prefusion F elicits higher titre neutralizing 
antibodies than postfusion F in experimental animals. The immunogenicity of the chosen antigens of 
RSVpreF, 847A and 847B, was evaluated and demonstrated in mice, cotton rats, Wistar Han rats, NZW 
rabbits, and nonhuman primates. 
The in vivo data demonstrate, in RSV-naïve experimental animals, that immunisation with stabilised 
prefusion F elicits much higher neutralizing titres than immunisation with postfusion F. In the cotton 
rat model, immunisation with RSVpreF protects cotton rats from RSV shedding and does not enhance 
respiratory pathology upon infectious RSV challenge. 
The immunogenicity of the prefusion F constructs was assessed in mice, cotton rats and monkeys. In 
cotton rats and monkeys used palivizumab as a control, to serve as a potential threshold of protection.  
All non-clinical PD studies – except the study in Rhesus Macaques (VR-VTR-10388), have been 
conducted in female animals. For the provided proof-of-concept (immunogenicity) studies, this is 
agreed. Potential gender differences with respect to induced immune responses, vaccine efficacy, etc. 
have been investigated in the human target population (study C3671001, C3671002). Immunogenicity 
studies were performed only in male animals as this is the approach used in the chosen CRO. 
The neutralising activity of the RSV prefusion F vaccine was investigated using RSV laboratory and 
clinical strains.  
Demonstration of preclinical efficacy and absence of vaccine-enhanced pathology was assessed in a 
cotton rat RSV challenge model. Various doses were used in these studies and the dose in the second 
study included a dose level representative of the lowest planned clinical dose of 60 µg (30 µg of each 
drug substance). 
During the course of this animal study (Evaluation of Safety, Efficacy and Immunogenicity of Candidate 
Vaccines in the RSV Cotton Rat Model, Study Number: VR-VTR-10390 / XV-154, (PRL-RSV-2016-06)), 
three cotton rats, 109330 (group 8), 109317 (group 6) and 109300 (group 5) had medical incidents. 
The cotton rats found dead were considered unrelated to the administration of the RSV vaccines. All 
three animals showed no signs of injury, were well groomed, well-nourished and showed no signs of 
dehydration. Neither did the cotton rats have a history of malocclusion or showed signs of it when 
found dead. A full necropsy was performed and macroscopy did not show anything obvious. The cause 
of death was not determined in the pathological evaluation, however, it was confirmed that no animal 
administered the RSVpreF vaccine candidate was affected by the incidents. 
The recombinant, bivalent, stabilised prefusion RSV F subunit vaccine candidate (RSVpreF) contains 
two F antigens, 847A from RSV subgroup A and 847B from subgroup B, present in equal amounts in a 
lyophilised dosage form for reconstitution. Based on clinical safety and immunogenicity data, the final 
formulation selected for pivotal efficacy studies was RSVpreF 120 μg without Al(OH)3, although 
complete protection in the upper airways of the Cotton Rat studies required inclusion of Al(OH)3 or 
CpG 24555/Al(OH)3 with the bivalent 847 prefusion F vaccine candidate. 
In this sense, it is not clear whether the RSVpreF materials used in the non-clinical PD studies are 
sufficiently representative of the material used in the clinic and commercially. The applicant provided 
an adequate overview of the tested RSVpreF material used in the non-clinical PD studies, the 
corresponding DP and DS batch numbers, and the production methods/processes submitted originally 
in Module 3 of the MAA dossier. Equally, a plausible conclusion on the representativeness of the 
Assessment report

RSVpreF material (used in the non-clinical pharmacodynamic studies) for the clinical use was 
subsequently submitted.  
Adsorption of the 847A and 847B antigens to Al(OH)3 alone further enhances neutralizing antibody 
titres. However, based on clinical safety and immunogenicity data, the final clinical formulation 
selected for pivotal efficacy studies was RSVpreF 120 μg without Al(OH)3. 
No secondary pharmacology, safety pharmacology or pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were 
performed. This is acceptable as these studies are generally not considered necessary to support the 
development and licensure of vaccines for infectious diseases (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been conducted with RSVpreF. Such studies are not considered 
necessary for vaccine products (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2014). 
Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety of RSVpreF was evaluated in a GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, 
and in a combined fertility and pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant and lactating rabbits. 
While the commercial formulation will be RSVpreF without any adjuvants and is supported by 
nonclinical data of RSVpreF alone, evaluations of the vaccine with Al(OH)3 were also performed in the 
same studies. 
Repeat-dose administrations of RSVpreF for a total of 3 doses to Wistar Han rats were tolerated 
without evidence of systemic toxicity and produced a functional antibody response and anticipated 
local inflammatory reaction. RSVpreF-related changes in neutrophils, acute phase proteins, and 
albumin: globulin ratio as well as microscopic findings at the injection site and in the draining lymph 
nodes were consistent with those seen with administration of vaccines. However it was noted that 
female rats administered RSVpreF without Al(OH)3 did not exhibit a functional antibody response to 
either RSV A or RSV B. Geometric mean titres identical to control groups, and below the LOD. Female 
rats responded to RSVpreF + Al(OH)3, demonstrating the capability to induce an immune response in 
female HW rats. The applicant explained that the lack of a response in this group was a species-
specific response as robust RSV antibody responses were measured in female rabbits and humans.  
The RSV neutralisation assay is considered qualified for use in the detection of antibodies present in 
serum These assays were used to measure antibodies in Study AB22373 in which robust RSV B 
antibody responses were measured in female rabbits and were successfully used for early phase 
clinical testing as well.

of maternal systemic toxicity or effects on mating performance or fertility in female rabbits or on

Al(OH)3). At PND 35, kit titres for RSV A and RSV B were approximately 5 times lower than the 
maternal titres.

ERA 
The applicant has provided a statement that due to the nature of its constituents an ERA is not

2.5.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology and toxicology studies performed are in line with the WHO Guidelines (2005, 2014 
and 2020), supporting the dose, dosing schedule and route of administration of RSVpreF to humans. 
The absence of pharmacokinetic studies is acceptable to the CHMP. The applicant has provided 
acceptable responses to the concerns raised by the Committee; therefore, the non-clinical package can 
now be considered acceptable in support of the MAA.

WI257521 – Human challenge study in healthy adults 18-50 years 
This was a randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of RSVpreF 
(120 µg) in a virus challenge model in healthy male and female subjects aged 18-50 years.  
Figure 1: Study Schematic: On-study Participant Progression 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of RSVpreF in reducing the incidence or the severity 
of infection or disease due to RSV-A Memphis 37b compared to placebo in ~72 healthy male and 
female subjects aged 18-50 years. Vaccine was administered on Day -28 (±3 days) and challenge was 
on Day 0 using RSV-A Memphis 37b 4.5 log10 PFU administered intranasally (2 x 250 μL per nostril).  
The primary analysis was conducted in the ITT-Challenge (ITTc) Analysis Set, which included all 
randomised, vaccinated and challenged subjects. The primary endpoint was qRT-PCR-confirmed 
symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 1), defined as: 
o   qRT-PCR-confirmed RSV infection based on two detectable (≥LLOD) qRT-PCR measurements (on 2 
or more consecutive days), starting two days post-viral challenge (Day +2) up to discharge from 
quarantine AND 
o   Either one or more positive clinical symptoms of any grade from two different categories in the 
symptom scoring system or one Grade 2 symptom from any category.

VE was derived from the Relative Risk (RR), where VE = 1-RR and RR is the ratio of the proportion of 
participants infected in the vaccine arm to the proportion of participants infected in the placebo arm. 
The 95% confidence interval was derived using the Farrington-Manning method. As an exploratory 
proof of concept study, no adjustment for Type I error was planned in regard to the primary endpoint 
family. Up to 72 participants were to be enrolled with 62 participants challenged with virus. 
There were 70 subjects randomised and 62 were challenged (ITTc set). The age range was 19-50 
years with mean in the range 24-27 years. The majority was male (71%) and White (overall 93%). 
qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 1, Day 2 to Day 12)  
Based on this definition (see above), 2 (6.5%) subjects were classed as infected in the RSVpreF group 
vs. 15 (48.4%) in the placebo group. VE was computed as 86.7%, with a lower bound of the 95% CI 
>50%. The median time to onset was 2.8 days for placebo and 4.8 days for RSVpreF. 
qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 2, Day 2 to Day 12)  
Participants had to have 2 positive quantifiable (≥LLOQ) qRT-PCR results within 4 consecutive time 
points AND either have one or more symptoms of any grade from 2 different categories (URT, LRT, 
Systemic) OR have one symptom of grade 2 or higher within the time period. Based on this definition 
there were no cases in the RSVpreF group but the rate was 13/31 (41.9%) in the placebo group and 
VE was computed as 100.0% with a lower bound of the 95% CI >70%.  
qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 3, Day 2 to Day 12)  
Participants had to have 2 positive quantifiable (≥LLOQ) qRT-PCR results at any time point AND have 
one or more symptoms of grade 1 or higher within the time period. Based on this definition, there were 
no cases in the RSVpreF group, but the rate was 18/31 (58.1%) in the placebo group and VE was 
computed as 100.0% with a lower bound of the 95% CI >80%. 
qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 4, Day 2 to Day 12)  
Participants had to have 2 positive (detected) qRT-PCR results within 4 consecutive time points AND 
have a TSS ≥ 2 within the time period. Based on this definition, the case rates were 2/31 (6.5%) in 
the RSVpreF group vs. 17/31 (54.8%) in the placebo group and VE was computed as 88.2% with a 
lower bound of the 95% CI near to 60%. 
qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infection (Variant 5, Day 2 to Day 12)  
Participants had to have 2 quantifiable positive (≥LLOQ) qRT-PCR results AND either have one or more 
symptoms of any grade from 2 different categories (URT, LRT, Systemic) OR have one symptom of 
grade 2 or higher within the time period. Based on this definition, there were no cases in the RSVpreF 
group vs. 13/31 (41.9%) in the placebo group and VE was computed as 100% with a lower bound of 
the 95% CI >70%. The median time to onset in the placebo group was 3.3 days. 
The viral load AUC was significantly lower with RSVpreF and the peak viral load was markedly lower 
with a mean difference vs. placebo of -3.3245 log10 copies/mL. In the subgroup with laboratory-
confirmed infection, the mean difference was -2.6270 log10 copies/mL. The median duration of viral 
detection was 18.0 hours for RSVpreF and 131.6 hours for placebo in the ITTc population. 
For the sum of the TSS, geometric means were 2.1 for the RSVpreF group vs. 10.8 for the placebo 
group (median 0.0 vs. 16.0). The geometric mean ratio was 0.26.  
Pre-vaccination NA50 titres were comparable in the two groups. At Day 12 post-challenge, the GMT 
~doubled in the placebo group. At Days 28 and 155, the titres were still much higher in the RSVpreF 
group vs. the placebo group. At 7 days after vaccination, there was a marked increase in the CD4+ T-
cell response in RSVpreF group, indicating a TH1 response. In the placebo group, an increase in both 
RSV F-specific and M-specific CD4+ T-cell response (TH1) was observed for day 10 after challenge vs.

C3671013 - Efficacy in older adults 
This was a Phase 3 randomised and double-blind, placebo-controlled vaccine efficacy study in generally 
healthy subjects aged from 60 years. There were 240 sites in 7 countries (Argentina, Canada, US, 
Finland, Netherlands, S. Africa and Japan). The study was initiated August 2021 and the CSR dated 22 
September 2022 reflects data up to 8 July 2022 for cases and 14 July 2022 for some other endpoints.  
Methods 
There was stratification of eligible subjects at randomisation by age group: 60-69 years (aim at least 
6,000), 70-79 years (aim at least 6,000) and 80+ years (aim at least 800). Approximately 10% were 
to have stable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions. Subjects with unstable illnesses and 
immunosuppressed persons were excluded. 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 to vaccine or placebo, given IM into the deltoid. The vaccine contained 
120 μg of the RSV prefusion F antigen (60 μg of each of A and B). Placebo contained the excipients.

The primary efficacy objective, estimand and endpoint, and the most important secondary efficacy 
endpoint (severe RSV LRTI; sLRTI), are shown in the table below.

Other secondary endpoints included efficacy for LRTI-RSV across two seasons and only in the second 
season, and efficacy for any acute respiratory illness (ARI) confirmed to be due to RSV. 
Starting on Day 15 (Day 1 = day of vaccination), there was active surveillance for acute respiratory 
illness (ARI) symptoms and subjects used e-diaries or equivalent technology. Subjects completed a 
questionnaire if they developed symptoms of an ARI during the RSV season and were to collect mid-
turbinate nasal swabs on days 2-3 of symptom(s) for RT-PCR testing. The table below shows the 
endpoint assessments and definitions.

This was case-driven study. With a 5% type I error (2-sided) for LRTI-RSV cases, to have minimum 
90% power to demonstrate that the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for RSVpreF VE is >20%, 59 
LRTI-RSV cases were required in the evaluable efficacy population, assuming that the true vaccine 
efficacy is 70% for LRTI-RSV as defined above. With a conservative assumption of an attack rate of 
0.35% for LRTI-RSV, allowing for up to 10% non-evaluable, approximately 30,000 subjects were 
required to accrue 59 cases. If case accrual was lower than expected, the study permitted enrolment 
of subjects in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) or additional subjects in the NH in the following year, 
with maximum enrolment up to 45,000. 
The evaluable efficacy population was the primary population for efficacy analyses (see table below for 
definition). The analyses were repeated on the mITT efficacy population. 
Table 3: Defined analysis set & description 
VE was defined as VE = 100 × (1 - risk ratio). Risk ratio was the case count of first-episode confirmed 
cases in the RSVpreF group vs. the corresponding case count in the placebo group. The CI of the VE 
used the conditional exact test based on the binomial distribution of the number of cases in the 
RSVpreF group, given the total number of cases in both groups. Two methods were used for sensitivity 
analysis of VE: one method adjusted the follow-up time (1-IR ratio) and the other method used the 
time to the first episode of case onset (1-HR). For the primary endpoint, analyses were performed for 
RSV A+ and RSV B+, separately.  
For the primary efficacy objective and key secondary objective, RSVpreF was to be compared to 
placebo, with sequential testing of the following 3 hypotheses, where H0 and Ha represent the null and 
alternative hypotheses, respectively: 
1. H0: VE ≤20% vs Ha: VE >20% against first episode of LRTI-RSV with ≥2 symptoms (as defined by 
≥2 of the 5 LRTI signs/symptoms in the first RSV season) 
2. H0: VE ≤20% vs Ha: VE >20% against first episode of LRTI-RSV with ≥3 symptoms (as defined by 
≥3 of the 5 LRTI signs/symptoms in the first RSV season) 
3. H0: VE ≤20% vs Ha: VE >20% against first episode of sLRTI-RSV in the first RSV season 
The 3 hypothesis tests were to be tested sequentially as ordered, with an overall type I error of 5% (2-
sided) or a 1-sided alpha of 2.5%. No additional endpoints were included in the confirmatory testing 
strategy for this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 44/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
An interim analysis was planned when at least 29 evaluable first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 
symptoms were accrued and it was actually conducted when 44 first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 
symptoms had accrued in the first RSV season.  
All study participants remained in blinded follow-up after the interim analysis. After the DMC declared 
success of first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms, there were 16 first-episode LRTI-RSV 
cases with ≥3 symptoms accrued so the interim analysis of that endpoint was also conducted. 
However, <12 cases of first-episode sLRTI-RSV had accrued as of the cut-off date so no interim 
analysis of this endpoint was conducted. 
Results 
As of the data cut-off date (14 July 2022), 34,284 subjects had been randomised and received study 
intervention. There was a low rate of withdrawals in either group (5.3%) after vaccination and the 
most common reasons were withdrawal by the subject (2.6%) and lost to follow-up (1.9%). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the RSVpreF and placebo groups.

groups 
For the primary analysis, the lower bound of the confidence interval was >20%. This was also the case 
for the other calculations of VE based on the IR ratio and the HR.  
Based on 11 cases, the lower bounds of the CIs for VE efficacy against RSV A were >0.  
Based on 33 cases, the lower bounds of the CIs for VE against RSV B were just under 0 or just over 0 
depending on method of calculation.

Efficacy Population 
Figure 2: Cumulative Case Accrual Curve From Day of Vaccination, First Episode of LRTI-RSV With ≥2 
Symptoms – Evaluable Efficacy Population 
For LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms with onset from Day 15, the median duration per episode was 
12.0 days in the RSVpreF group and 11.5 days in the placebo group. Similar results applied to the 
mITT population, with only one additional first-episode LRTI-RSV case with ≥2 symptoms reported 
before Day 15 (from Day 1 [vaccination date]) in the placebo group. 
In the evaluable efficacy population there were 17 subjects with 17 episodes of LRTI-RSV with ≥3 
symptoms reported after vaccination, of which one was reported before Day 15 so that 16 episodes 
were included in the VE analysis as shown below. Results were consistent across methods of 
calculating VE with lower bounds of 96.66% CIs >30%.

With only 4 cases due to RSV A, it can only be pointed out that there was one case in the vaccine 
group and 3 in the placebo group.  
For RSV B, with 1 and 10 cases in respective groups, the lower bounds of the 96.66% Cis were >20% 
regardless of method of calculation.

In the evaluable efficacy population there were 82 subjects with 83 episodes of ARI-RSV reported after 
vaccination, of which 2 were reported before Day 15 so 80 were included in the VE analysis with 
results as shown below. The median duration per episode was 8.5 days in the RSVpreF group and 11.0 
days in the placebo group. Efficacy against ARI-RSV was demonstrated, with lower bounds of the 95% 
CI above 35% regardless of method of calculation. Similar results applied to the mITT population. 
Table 7: Vaccine Efficacy of RSVpreF Agains First Episode of ARI-RSV – Evaluable Efficacy 
Population 
Across the larger subgroups, VE point estimates for first-episode LRTI-RSV with ≥2 symptoms were 
generally similar to those observed in the main analysis. The lower bound of the 96.66% CI was >zero 
for female subjects, white subjects, non-Hispanic/Latino subjects, USA subjects and for those with no 
pre-specified significant conditions.  
In this regard, it should be noted that the majority of subjects was enrolled in the US (~21,200), 
followed by Argentina (~8,100) and Japan (~2300). Just over 1,000 was enrolled in each of S. Africa 
and Canada, with ~1500 in Netherlands and ~800 in Finland. The only subgroup for which the point 
estimate of efficacy was not in favour of RSVpreF was the Black and African American population, 
comprising ~4400 subjects. However, the point estimate was favourable for RSVpreF in S. Africa.

C3671003: A Phase 2b, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of RSVpreF vaccine in pregnant women 18 through 49 years of age and their 
infants. The supplementary CSR for C3671003 provides additional the results for exploratory efficacy 
endpoints in infants born to vaccinated and unvaccinated mothers. Although efficacy was exploratory, 
the study is included here since it directly preceded the Phase 3 efficacy study. 
C3671008: A Phase 3, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of RSVpreF vaccine in infants born to women vaccinated during pregnancy. Some, but not 
all, aspects of methodology were the same as in the Phase 2b study. 
C3671003 
Eligible healthy women were aged 18 to 49 years and were between 24 0/7 and 36 0/7 weeks of 
gestation (determined from ultrasound results obtained at ≥18 weeks) on the day of planned 
vaccination. They were to have an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy achieved without assisted 
reproduction, with no known increased risk for complications and no significant fetal abnormalities on 
ultrasound. They were receiving prenatal standard of care with a negative urinalysis for protein and 
glucose at the screening visit (Visit 0) except that trace proteinuria was acceptable if the blood 
pressure was normal. The BMI was to be <40 kg/m2 at the screening visit.  
Subjects were randomised in equal numbers into five groups to receive RSVpreF 120 μg (60 μg A and 
60 μg B) or 240 μg (120 μg A and 120 μg B), each with or without aluminium hydroxide, or placebo 
(saline). All injections were into the deltoid.  
The primary and secondary objectives concerned safety and immunogenicity.

Table 12: Objectives, Endpoints, and Estimands, - Infant Participants 
Table 13: Efficacy in infants was exploratory. 
Case ascertainment involved contact of the infant’s parent/legal guardian(s) every 7 to 10 days after 
delivery until the 6-month follow-up visit. The criteria to prompt an acute illness visit required 1 or 
more of the following signs or symptoms: 
Inability to feed for any duration due to respiratory tract illness; 
•  Difficulty breathing, laboured breathing or rapid breathing for any duration; 
• 
• 
•  Any other respiratory symptom of concern.  
Thick discharge from the nose for 48 hours or more; 
If the infant could not attend the visit because of hospitalisation or treatment at another medical 
facility, the data were to be recorded in the CRF based on any available medical records.

Medically significant RSV-associated LRTI was defined based on meeting the following criteria to be 
considered an “RSV LRTI case” for analysis and reporting purposes: 
One or more of the following signs of LRTI: 
Lower chest wall indrawing or subcostal retractions, 
•  Nasal flaring, 
• 
•  Rhonchi, 
•  Grunting, 
•  Wheezing, 
•  Crackles/rales/crepitations 
Plus one of the following signs/symptoms of medically significant respiratory disease: 
Increased respiratory rate, 
• 
•  ≥60 breaths/min (<2 months of age [<60 days of age]) 
•  ≥45 breaths/min (2 to 6 months of age [60 days to 180 days of age]) 
•  Use of mechanical ventilation (intubation or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), 
•  Difficulty feeding, 
•  Signs of dehydration: sunken fontanelle, dry/sticky mucous membranes, skin tenting  
AND 
• 
Proven RSV by positive RT-PCR. 
Before unblinding the data, additional definitions of LRTI (medically attended LRTI and medically 
attended severe LRTI) were established and applied to the analysis of LRTIs. 
The sample size for the study was not driven by any specific hypothesis testing. The plan was to enrol 
up to 650 pregnant women with randomisation into one of five groups as above. There was no 
stratification applied at randomisation. 
Unblinded site personnel prepared and administered the vaccine and placebo for injection since the 
appearance of vaccine and placebo was not identical. The study subjects, investigators, study co-
ordinators and all other study site staff were blinded to treatment assignment. 
Subjects (total 579; 114-117 per group) were enrolled in Argentina, Chile, South Africa and the US. 
Most randomised subjects completed vaccination and completed delivery of their infants in the study. 
Women who delivered within 1 month of vaccination were not eligible to complete the 1 month after 
vaccination visit. The most frequent reason for withdrawal during the study was lost to follow-up. Most 
infants completed the 1 month and 6 month visit and the most frequent reason for withdrawal during 
the study was lost to follow-up.  
Demographic characteristics of women were similar across vaccine groups with a median age at 
vaccination of ~27 years and median gestational age at vaccination of ~30 weeks. One fifth or less 
were enrolled at 24 to <27 weeks of gestation. With only one country in the N. hemisphere, it appears 
that the vast majority of pregnant women were enrolled in the USA.

Half of the infants born to randomised women were female and the majority was born at term with a 
median gestational age of 39 weeks and range from ~31-42 weeks.  
In pregnant women, all doses and formulations of RSVpreF induced NA50 increments from baseline to 
RSV A and RSV B and the GMTs were higher than in those who received placebo from 2 weeks post-
dose until 6 months after delivery. The figure shows the combined (i.e. RSV A and B) NA50 titres as an 
example.

Population 
In general, the combined RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMTs at one month after vaccination with RSVpreF 
formulated with Al(OH)3 were higher compared to RSVpreF alone but GMTs were similar in those who 
received 120 μg or 240 μg of RSVpreF.  
Titres peaked at 2 weeks post-dose, at which time the higher antigen dose appeared to elicit higher 
GMTs vs. the lower antigen dose and there did seem to be some benefit for adding Al(OH)3 to the 
higher dose. At delivery and at 6 months post-delivery, the GMTs were still higher than at pre-
vaccination. 
With the minority enrolled in the S. hemisphere, the GMTs did not show any major differences vs. 
those enrolled in the N. hemisphere at 2 weeks post-dose but trended higher at one month. There was 
no consistent trend in terms of peak GMTs according to gestational age at time of maternal 
vaccination.

these are ratios for maternal vs. infant titres at time of birth; see footnote c regarding calculation) for 
of RSV A, RSV B and combined were >1 for all vaccine groups.  
There was no consistent pattern for maternal to infant placental transfer ratios when presented 
according to hemisphere and gestational age at time of maternal immunisation.

Very few infants were delivered within 2 weeks of maternal vaccination. However, for these few data, 
transfer ratios calculated for subgroups defined by maternal immunisation within or more than 14 days 
before delivery suggested that early delivery was associated with low transfer. This is in keeping with 
peak maternal immune responses at about 2 weeks post-dose.  
When the calculation was repeated with a 30-day window cut-off, delivery within 30 days gave lower 
transfer ratios.

to vaccinated mothers remained higher than those born to mothers assigned to placebo.

Immunogenicity Population 
In pregnant women who received any candidate vaccine formulation the prefusion F binding IgG GMCs 
were comparable regardless of Al[OH]3 or antigen dose. Maternal vaccination with the RSVpreF vaccine 
at all doses and formulations yielded high serum IgG concentrations in infants to both RSV A and RSV 
B that were also higher than those in the infants born to mothers given placebo. RSV A and RSV B 
prefusion F binding IgG GMCs were similar in infants regardless of the RSVpreF formulation (with or 
without Al[OH]3) or dose level received by their mothers.  
RSV-associated LRTI in infants ranged from 0 to 2 infants in the RSVpreF groups and 3 infants in the 
placebo group. RSV-associated (RSV A or RSV B) acute respiratory tract illnesses in infants ranged 
from 2 to 8 infants across RSVpreF groups and 13 infants in the placebo group. LRTI in infants ranged 
from 3 to 7 infants in the RSVpreF groups and 6 infants in the placebo group.  
When all vaccine groups were combined and compared to placebo, the point estimates for VE (pooled 
across RSVpreF formulations) against RSV-associated medically significant infant LRTI, medically 
attended LRTI and medically attended severe LRTI were 75%, 75% and 83%, respectively (see

footnotes for additional information on LRTI definitions). In this Phase 2 study, with few cases, the 
95% confidence intervals for the estimates of vaccine efficacy all include zero. The results for the N. 
hemisphere infants alone were similar with respective point estimates for VE of 75%, 85% and 92%.

There was an active surveillance period in infants from 72 h after birth through 6 months after delivery 
(Visit 3). Respiratory distress events within 72 hours of birth were not captured as MA-RTI events but 
as AEs/SAEs (if applicable). Study staff were to contact the infant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
approximately every week electronically, by phone call or face-to-face. If the infant had an event 
requiring a healthcare visit, the site staff were to determine if MA-RTI criteria were met: 
•  Nasal discharge for 24 hours or more 
•  Difficulty breathing, laboured breathing, or rapid breathing for any duration 
•  Cough 
• 
•  Apnoea 
•  Any other respiratory symptom of concern 
Inability to feed for any duration due to respiratory symptoms 
If the criteria were met, the infant was to be seen optimally within 72 hours but within 10 days for an 
RTI study visit. Samples were analysed for RSV A, RSV B and other respiratory pathogens by PCR-
based assays at Pfizer’s central laboratory. Any RSV testing performed locally was considered valid if 
conducted in CLIA-certified central laboratories using a FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification 
technology (NAAT)-based test for RSV.  
The active surveillance period was followed by long-term surveillance for infants from 6 months after 
delivery (Visit 3; 180-210 days after birth) until the last study visit (maximum 24 months after birth). 
During this period, study staff contacted the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) approximately every month. 
There was an EAC appointed to adjudicate all efficacy endpoints illness (MA-RTI, MA-LRTI or severe 
MA-LRTI). The EAC was blinded to vaccine assignment. All MA-RTI events were referred to the EAC for 
adjudication and the EAC’s decision was regarded as the final confirmed endpoint classification of the 
event. The EAC adjudicated all RSV-positive MA-RTI cases through the active follow-up period up to 
180 days after birth as well as all RSV-associated cases of hospitalisation and severe MA-LRTI. The 
Pfizer study team could also request that additional cases of interest be reported to the committee, 
including cases in which RSV testing was indeterminate or otherwise unclear.  
Starting from time of vaccination (where Day 1 is the day of vaccination) until the end of the study, all 
women were monitored for MA-RTIs. Full details of the illness were to be recorded.  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
Assessment report

Page 65/151 
 
 
 
 
There were two primary efficacy endpoints (MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI) and the study could be 
declared a success based on one or both of these endpoints. The null hypothesis to be tested concerns 
VE for the primary endpoints. The RSV vaccine was compared to placebo testing the hypotheses H0: VE 
≤20% vs. Ha: VE >20%. For all secondary efficacy endpoints, the RSV vaccine was compared to 
placebo testing the hypotheses H0: VE ≤0% vs Ha: VE >0%. Hypothesis testing of the secondary 
endpoints was conditional upon rejection of the null hypothesis for at least 1 of the primary endpoints. 
In order for the study to have at least 90% power to reject the null hypothesis for MA-LRTI due to RSV 
when true VE is 60%, a total of 124 cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days of birth were required 
in the evaluable population. This also accounted for potential use of an alpha of 1.25% 1-sided within 
the multiplicity adjustment.  
There was no explicit case target for the endpoint of severe MA-LRTI due to RSV. Depending on the 
assumed true VE, power for that individual hypothesis may be lower, but the power for the primary 
endpoint family was to be at least 90%. 
The incidence of the primary endpoints was expected to vary by region, with an assumed rate for MA-
LRTI due to RSV through 90 days in low-incidence countries of ~1.75% and ~3.9% in other regions.  
With these assumptions, and also allowing for 60% VE and 10% of subjects being non-evaluable, it 
was planned to enrol ~6900 pregnant women.

The SAP (V 6.0) is dated 2 September 2022. It was developed and finalised before database lock for 
the first planned analysis. The table summarises the methods applied to the primary endpoints.  
Table 20: Primary endpoints 
Assessment report

The two primary endpoints of MA-LRTI due to RSV and severe MA-LRTI due to RSV were tested in 
parallel using a Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment procedure, whereby alpha = 0.0125 (one-sided) is 
allocated to each endpoint. 
The main analysis was also performed based on the mITT efficacy infant population. A supportive 
analysis of the primary endpoint was to be performed to address the potential intercurrent event of 
palivizumab administration via a composite estimand strategy in the mITT efficacy infant set. The 
endpoint was the occurrence of either MA-LRTI due to RSV (as defined for the main analysis) or receipt 
of palivizumab. VE was estimated in the same way as for the main analysis. 
Where MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI visits had no accompanying valid central or local NAAT test 
results, positive or negative results were imputed. Based on a blinded review of swab results at the 
end of February 2022, approximately 22% of all swabs from MA-LRTI events with valid central lab 
results cases proved to be RSV-positive. Thus, a minority of the missing results were expected to be 
truly RSV-positive and imputation scenarios included: 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 68/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Missing swab results were assumed to be positive in the same proportion (by vaccine group) as 
the non-missing swab results in MA-LRTI events (missing-at-random assumption). 
• 
For the vaccine group, missing swab results were assumed to be positive in higher proportions 
than the non-missing swab results in MA-LRTI events. In the placebo group missing swab 
results were assumed to be positive in the same proportion as the non-missing swab results in 
MA-LRTI events (missing-not-at-random assumption). A range of higher vaccine group 
positivity rates was assumed. 
Multiple imputations were performed to randomly assign missing swab results. SAS PROC MI was used 
to generate 500 imputed data sets for each scenario. Mean and median VE across imputations, and the 
proportion of imputations with VE lower bound >20% were to be reported. 
If any such events were adjudicated, only those that were confirmed by the EAC as MA-LRTI or severe 
MA-LRTI were to undergo imputation. The imputed RSV-positive cases will be added to the per-
protocol cases and VE estimated in the same way as for the main analysis. 
The study was planned such that interim analyses could be performed to assess efficacy and safety 
after at least 43 cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days of birth had accrued. Only cases that had 
been fully adjudicated prior to taking a data snapshot were to be included in an interim analysis.  
The analysis of efficacy was to use an O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending rule based on the fraction of 
cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days available. The exact number of cases at each interim 
analysis was not fixed but no fewer than 43 cases were to be included in the first interim analysis and 
no fewer than 62 in the second interim analysis.  
To control the overall type 1 error for the two primary endpoints at 2.5% 1-sided, a first interim 
analysis at 43 cases would use a 1-sided significance level of 0.014%. If a second interim analysis was 
performed at 62 cases, it would use a 1-sided significance level of 0.15%. The final analysis at the 
target number of cases would use a 1-sided significance level of 2.45%. In each case, this alpha would 
be split between the two endpoints using the Bonferroni correction.  
Futility was to be assessed using conditional power. For example, if there were 62 cases available for 
the interim analysis, the table shows the case splits for which stopping the study was to be considered. 
The actual number of cases available could be slightly higher or lower than 62, and the decision rules 
amended accordingly.

Results  
Results are currently reported in a CSR of 6 December 2022. As of 2 September 2022, 7392 pregnant 
women had been randomised into the study, of which 3682 randomised to RSVpreF and 3675 
randomised to placebo were included in the safety population. The safety population of infants 
comprised 3568 and 3558 born to mothers in respective randomised groups.

Table 22: Disposition of All Participants – Infant Participants 
The largest subgroup of pregnant women (44.7%) was in the gestational age range ≥32 weeks to ≤36 
weeks at the time of vaccination. The median maternal age at the time of study vaccination was 29.0 
years with a range from 14-47 years. Most had a history of 0 (33%) or 1 (~31%) prior pregnancies.

Table 23: Demographic Characteristics – Maternal Participants – Safety Population 
Half of the infants were female. Most infants were born at term (≥93.7% born at ≥37 weeks to <42 
weeks). Birth outcomes for infants were similar for the RSVpreF and placebo groups.  Most of the pre-
term infants were near-term at birth (≥4.4% were ≥34 to <37 weeks GA).  
Table 24: Analysis Populations – Infant Participants 
The first interim efficacy analysis was conducted in April 2022, at which time 56 evaluable cases of MA-
LRTI due to RSV with onset within 90 days of birth had accrued. The E-DMC reviewed the results and 
recommended continuation of the study. The second interim efficacy analysis was conducted on 28 
October 2022. The analysis included 80 evaluable cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV with onset within 90 
days of birth, of which 39 were severe MA-LRTI. The point estimates for VE against MA-LRTI due to 
RSV based on all cases accrued through the data cut-off date were in the range 51-57%. The lower

bounds of the CI were above the 20% pre-defined criterion for success except for cases in the first 90 
days after birth (lower bound 14.7%). The E-DMC recommended stopping the study.

Palivizumab was given to 2 infants in the vaccine group and 10 in the placebo group. There were no 
cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV in the 2 infants given palivizumab in the vaccine group vs. 1 in the 10 in 
the placebo group up to day 180. No infants who received palivizumab were hospitalised. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to address missing or invalid swab results. When all positive RSV 
tests were considered, including non-NAAT tests, the results were similar to the primary analysis.

The point estimates for VE against severe MA-LRTI due to RSV based on all cases accrued through the 
data cut-off date were in the range 69-82%. The lower bounds of the CI were well above the 20% pre-
defined criterion for success and all were above 40%. The primary analysis of efficacy for cases up to 
day 90 met the pre-defined success criterion. In the mITT population, there were 2 additional cases of 
severe RSV MA-LRTI in the vaccine group within 90 days of birth and one in the placebo group within 
150 days of birth. All lower bounds of the CI were well above 20%. There were no cases of severe RSV 
in any infants who received palivizumab.

As of the cut-off date, there were 10 hospitalisations due to EAC-confirmed RSV in infants within 90 
days after birth in the RSVpreF group and 31 in the placebo group in the evaluable efficacy population, 
corresponding to a VE of 67.7% (99.17% CI: 15.9, 89.5). There were 19 vs. 44 such cases within 180 
days after birth, corresponding to a VE of 56.8% (99.17% CI: 10.1, 80.7) for RSVpreF. Additionally, 
there were 70 cases of investigator-reported RSV-positive MA-LRTI within 210 days after birth in the 
RSVpreF group and 127 in the placebo group in the evaluable efficacy population, corresponding to a

VE of 44.9% (99.17% CI: 17.9, 63.5) for RSVpreF. The observed VE within 240, 270, and 360 days 
after birth was consistent with the VE within 210 days after birth, with CI lower bounds >0%.

As of the cut-off date, there were 392 investigator-reported all-cause MA-LRTI episodes within 180 
days after birth in the RSVpreF group and 402 in the placebo group in the evaluable efficacy 
population, corresponding to a VE of 2.5% (99.17% CI: -17.9, 19.4). Within 360 days after birth, with 
504 and 531 cases, VE was 5.1% (99.17% CI: -12.1, 19.6).  
The table shows EAC-confirmed severe RSV MA-LRTI that occurred within 90 days of birth. The 
findings for cases up to 180 days gave a similar pattern. Most participating countries had no cases of 
severe RSV MA-LRTI. Total numbers are driven by Argentina and the US. However, for totals accrued 
from Day 120 to day 180 it seemed that there was a benefit for the vaccine against severe RSV MA-
LRTI even in S. Africa (by day 180 there were 2 cases in the vaccine group and 10 in the placebo 
group [VE 79.7%, lower bound CI 42.7]).

(58.2%) in the RSVpreF group and 2032 (58.4%) in the placebo group had at least 1 all-cause MA-RTI 
(i.e. not necessarily LRTI) within 730 days after birth as reported by investigators. The EAC evaluated 
all such events within 180 days after birth to determine if the event met criteria for the primary 
endpoints and evaluated hospitalised or severe MA-LRTIs up to 730 days after birth.  
Numbers of EAC-confirmed RSV-positive MA-RTI cases in infants within 180 days after birth were 157

C3671001 
This was a randomised and placebo-controlled first-in-human study with the RSVpreF antigen in 
healthy male and female subjects aged 18-85 years. RSVpreF doses were 60 µg (30 A and 30 B), 120 
µg (60 A and 60 B) or 240 µg (120 A and 120 B) of the prefusion RSV F antigen, with or without 
Al(OH)3. RSVpreF formulations were given with or without concomitant inactivated seasonal influenza 
vaccine (SIIV; Fluzone). The standard dose quadrivalent vaccine was used for subjects aged 18-49 
years and trivalent Fluzone HD was used for those aged 65-85 years. 
Sentinel Cohort 
All Sentinel Cohort subjects (aged 18-85 years) received either one dose of RSVpreF with Al(OH)3, 
RSVpreF without Al(OH)3 or placebo. Initial subjects received 60 µg (i.e. 30 µg of each RSV A and B 
preF). An IRC reviewed safety over 14 days post-dose and recommended progression to the next dose 
as well as recommending initiation of that dose level in the Expanded Cohort. 
Expanded Cohort 
Subjects in each age group (18-49 years and 65-85 years) were randomised to one of 13 groups 
equally (across each dose level or placebo, with or without SIIV co-administration). At Visit 1, all 
Expanded Cohort subjects received 2 injections: 
• 
One dose of RSVpreF with Al(OH)3 or RSVpreF without Al(OH)3 or placebo in the left deltoid 
muscle 
• 
One dose of SIIV or placebo in the right deltoid muscle

At Visit 2, subjects previously given placebo received SIIV and subjects previously given SIIV received 
placebo in the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm. 
At ~12 months, expanded cohort subjects from the initial 240 μg dose group who had received 
RSVpreF with or without Al(OH)3 were invited to be revaccinated with the same dose and formulation 
as before. The SIIV or placebo assignment and the vaccination scheme was the same as for the first 
year of the study. The placebo group was revaccinated with placebo alone followed by SIIV alone. 
Thus, subjects received two injections at Visit 7 and one at Visit 8.  
Data shown for the Sentinel and Expanded Cohort includes all subjects who did not receive SIIV with 
the first dose of vaccine. The figures below show that Month 1 NA responses to RSV A and RSV B preF 
trended slightly higher in the younger age group and the highest dose gave the largest increments but 
there was no advantage over the middle dose for the older subjects. NA against RSV B appeared 
slightly higher than against RSV A in both age groups. Al(OH)3 did not notably enhance the immune 
response at any antigen dose in either age group.

The GMRs across the 6 RSVpreF dose level and formulation groups for RSV A ranged from 0.78 to 1.02 
in the 18-49 years group and from 0.76 to 1.12 in the 65-85 years group. For RSV B, the 
corresponding GMRs ranged from 0.74 to 1.11 and from 0.74 to 1.30.  
While NA responses to RSVpreF with or without SIIV co-administration varied across dose level, 
formulation and age group, there were no notable differences observed on co-administration. 
At all sampling times to month 12, the RSV A and RSV B NA GMTs were higher compared to baseline 
and were also higher than those for the placebo group regardless of age group or inclusion of Al(OH)3.  
The same pattern was observed for those who received concomitant SIIV. An example of the graphical 
displays is shown below.

Expanded Cohorts – Evaluable RSV Immunogenicity Population 
In the Expanded Cohorts, the age group 65-85 years received HD trivalent SIIV that omitted the 
B/Phuket strain although the HAI GMTs and GMFRs for this strain were measured. There was a general 
trend to lower HAI responses to SIIV after concomitant administration with RSVpreF vs. SIIV alone 
although the differences were less pronounced in the older group of 50-85 years.  
RSVpreF interference with immune responses to SIIV generally increased with the RSVpreF antigen 
level in subjects aged 18-49 years but this was not a consistent finding in the older subjects. The 
proportions with HAI titres ≥1:40 and with seroconversion (≥ 4-fold rise) at 1 month after SIIV were 
lower when it was given with RSVpreF vs. given alone.  
Moreover, NA GMTs against H3N2 as well as proportions with HAI titres ≥1:40 and with seroconversion 
(≥ 4-fold rise) were generally lower after concomitant administration.

Of the 267 consented subjects (134 in the younger age group and 133 in the older age group), 263 
(98.5%) completed re-vaccination and 248 (92.9%) completed the study. At 1 month after 
revaccination, the NA GMFRs across the RSVpreF vaccine groups for RSV A ranged from 1.4 to 2.3 in 
the younger age group and from 1.4 to 2.2 in the older age group. Corresponding ranges for RSV B 
were 1.4 to 2.2 and 1.5 to 2.1.  
The figures below show that the month 1 post-dose NA GMTs were lower after revaccination compared 
to initial vaccination in both age groups and for RSV A and B but they were higher than for placebo.

C3671002 
This study evaluated the RSVpreF antigen adjuvanted with Al(OH)3 or CpG/Al(OH)3 in subjects aged 
65-85 years (mean age ~71 years). In Stage 1, there was randomisation of 254 subjects (250 
vaccinated) to a single dose of placebo or to one of 7 RSV A and B preF formulations. These 
formulations included three dose levels (60 μg [i.e. 30 μg of each of RSV A and B preF], 120 μg [60 μg 
of each] and 240 μg [120 μg of each]) tested with Al(OH)3 or CpG/Al(OH)3 plus 240 μg [120 μg of 
each of RSVpreF A and B] without adjuvant.  
The Month-0, Month-2 Cohort separately randomised 63 subjects to receive 2 doses of either 240 μg 
with CpG/Al(OH)3 or placebo given 2 months apart. SIIV (Fluzone HD) was administered concomitantly 
except for the Month-0, Month-2 Cohort. 
This study was terminated early (10 August 2020) after the sponsor’s interim analysis review of data 
from the designated Primary Cohort. This showed no enhancement of immune responses to RSVpreF 
when adjuvanted with CpG compared to adjuvantation with Al(OH)3 or no adjuvant. Also, there was no 
booster response to a second dose of RSVpreF with CpG/Al(OH)3 when this was administered 2 months 
after the initial dose. Therefore, the planned revaccination stage (Stage 2) of this study at month 12 
was not pursued. 
To assess co-administration with SIIV, NA titres at month 1 were compared between the Month-0, 
Month-2 Cohort and the Primary Cohort that received RSVpreF 240 μg + CpG/Al(OH)3. The GMRs were 
1.14 and 1.27 for RSV A and RSV B 50% NA titres, respectively, with lower bounds of 95% CIs ≥0.75, 
indicating no important negative interference of SIIV on the anti-RSVpreF responses.  
The HAI GMTs for A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Phuket after SIIV were similar or slightly lower when given 
with RSVpreF compared to co-administration with placebo.

This was a randomised and placebo-controlled study to evaluate co-administration of RSVpreF vaccine 
(120 or 240 µg) and tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap; Boostrix) in healthy 
non-pregnant women aged 18-49 years. Participants were randomised in equal numbers to one of 5 
treatment groups and all received 2 injections in accordance with their assignment as follows: 
•  RSVpreF 120 μg and Placebo (saline solution) 
•  RSVpreF 120 μg and Tdap 
•  RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3 (0.4 mg/mL) and Placebo 
•  RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3 (0.4 mg/mL) and Tdap 
• 
Placebo and Tdap 
Sera were obtained for determination of immune responses pre-vaccination and at one month post-
vaccination. The NA responses to RSV A and RSV B were determined as well as the anti-D, anti-T, anti-
PT and anti-FHA immune responses.   
There were 709 women vaccinated, of which 97.5% completed the post-vaccination visit. All non-
completers were lost to follow-up. The mean age of women was 35.6 years. 
At pre-vaccination, >80% of subjects still had at least 0.1 IU/mL anti-D and almost all subjects still 
had at least 0.1 IU/mL anti-T. The primary analysis met the pre-defined criteria for concluding on non-
inferior anti-D and anti-T responses when TdaP was given with RSVpreF vs. co-administration with 
placebo, i.e. the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CI for the differences in proportions reaching at 
least 0.1 IU/mL between combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups and the placebo/Tdap group were >-10%. As 
shown below, the actual lower bounds were within -5%.

The next table shows the exploratory analysis of the percentages with anti-T or anti-D antibody 
concentrations at the higher level of ≥1.0 IU/mL for the combined RSVpreF/Tdap group and the 
placebo/Tdap group.  
The percentage with anti-D ≥1.0 IU/mL before vaccination was higher in the combined RSVpreF/Tdap 
groups compared to the placebo/Tdap group (26.1% and 17.9%, respectively). The percentages with 
anti-T ≥1.0 IU/mL before vaccination were higher than for anti-D but they were comparable between 
the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups and the placebo/Tdap group (59.9% and 62.7%).  
As shown below, the proportion with at least 1.0 IU/mL anti-D at month 1 was considerably higher in 
the placebo group vs. the RSVpreF group with a difference of -25.4%.  
In contrast, very similar percentages in each group achieved at least 1.0 IU/mL anti-T at month 1, with 
more than 97% reaching this level.

RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/Tdap groups in comparison to the placebo/Tdap group before vaccination 
while percentages with anti-T ≥1.0 IU/mL before vaccination were similar across treatment groups. 
Table 44: Difference in % of Subjects Achieving Anti-TTd or Anti-DTd Antibody Concentrations ≥0.1

At month 1, percentages with anti-D ≥1.0 IU/mL were 53.3%, 49.6% and 76.9% for the RSVpreF 120 
μg/Tdap group, RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/Tdap group, and placebo/Tdap group, respectively. Nearly 
all participants in the RSVpreF 120 μg/Tdap group, RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/Tdap group and 
placebo/Tdap group achieved anti-T ≥1.0 IU/mL at 1 month after vaccination.  
Non-inferiority was not shown for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN immune responses since the lower 
bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the GMC ratios of the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups to the 
placebo/Tdap group did not exceed 0.67 (they ranged from 0.48 to 0.64).

The GMRs for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies were all <1 for the comparisons between the 
RSVpreF 120 μg/Tdap group and RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/Tdap group vs. placebo/TdaP. 
The observed anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN antibody GMCs were lower for the RSVpreF 120 μg/Tdap 
and RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/Tdap groups vs. the placebo/Tdap group. The GMFRs ranged from 4.16 
to 6.50 for the 2 RSVpreF groups, while GMFRs for the placebo/Tdap group ranged from 7.14 to 10.22 
at 1 month after vaccination. 
The primary comparison between immune responses to RSVpreF (RSV A and B) when administered 
concomitantly with Tdap compared to RSVpreF given alone (RSVpreF/placebo) met the predefined 
threshold for non-inferiority since the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the GMT ratios 
(RSVpreF/Tdap groups vs. RSVpreF/placebo groups) were >0.5 and actually exceeded 0.67. 
The observed RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMTs and the NA90 GMTs were each similar for the combined 
RSVpreF/Tdap groups and the combined RSVpreF/placebo groups before vaccination.  
The RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMRs for the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups and the combined 
RSVpreF/placebo groups were 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, at 1 month after vaccination. The lower 
bound values of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMRs were 0.84 and 0.81, 
respectively. The RSV A and RSV B NA90 GMRs for the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups and the 
combined RSVpreF/placebo groups were 0.94 and 0.91, respectively, at 1 month after vaccination. The 
lower bound values of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the RSV A and RSV B NA90 GMRs were 0.82 and 0.78,

Furthermore, the observed RSV A and RSV B NA GMFRs ranged from 12.73 to 16.41 across all the 
RSVpreF formulations, with the greatest response in the RSVpreF 240 μg + Al(OH)3/placebo group.

This was a lot-to-lot consistency study in healthy adults aged 18 to ≤49 years. Participants received 
one of three lots of RSVpreF (120 μg) or placebo and sera were obtained at pre-vaccination and at one 
month post-vaccination. The primary immunogenicity objective was as follows:

Table 47: The primary immunogenicity objective 
This study was conducted at 17 sites in the United States. For the evaluable immunogenicity 
population, RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMTs were substantially increased from pre- to post-vaccination for 
each of the 3 RSVpreF lots and this increase was consistent across lots but there was a negligible 
change in the placebo group. Lot consistency across the 3 RSVpreF lots was achieved in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population based on a 1.5-fold equivalence margin for both RSV A and RSV B 
antigens.  
Page 27 
Subgroup analyses by sex showed that the ratio of GMTs (GMRs) for RSV A and RSV B at 1 month 
after vaccination were similar for females and males in the evaluable immunogenicity population and 
mITT population. 
For the evaluable immunogenicity population, the GMFRs for RSV A and RSV B NTs were similar for all 
3 RSVpreF lots and ranged from 14.0 to 14.6 for RSV A and 14.2 to 15.1 for RSV B. GMFRs were close 
to 1 in the placebo group, indicating negligible change from baseline. 
For the evaluable immunogenicity population, GMCs of RSVpreF-binding IgG for RSV A and B were 
substantially increased from before vaccination to 1 month post-vaccination for each of the 3 RSVpreF 
lots and this increase was consistent across lots. The GMC change from baseline was negligible in the 
placebo group. The GMFRs of RSVpreF-binding IgG for RSV A and RSV B were similar for all 3 RSVpreF 
lots and ranged from 15.8 to 16.7 for RSV A and 15.9 to 16.4 for RSV B. GMFRs were close to 1 in the 
placebo group, indicating negligible change from baseline. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant sought two indications for use, with final wording as follows: 
• 
Passive protection against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) in infants from birth through 6 months of age following maternal immunisation during 
pregnancy. See sections 4.2 and 5.1. 
• 
Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 102/151 
 
 
 
 
 
The vaccine is given to adults aged from 60 years or to pregnant individuals with no mention of age, so 
it includes by default pregnant adolescents. Regardless of age and gender/pregnancy status the same 
formulation and single dose regimen (120 µg unadjuvanted) applies. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Selection of doses from immunogenicity data 
Immune responses in adults, including older adults 
The clinical development programme commenced with an exploration of three dose levels of RSV A and 
RSV B PreF (30 µg of each, 60 µg of each or 120 µg of each; referred to as 60 µg, 120 µg or 240 µg 
doses, respectively) administered with and without aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant. In this RSV-
experienced population, a single dose was administered with exploration of a second dose in the 240 
μg dose groups after 12 months. The primary readout was NA50 titres against RSV A and RSV B; the 
applicant also presented the total NA50 titres. The approach taken was appropriate. 
Immune responses in pregnant women 
Immune responses in pregnant women were explored in the Phase 2b study C3671003, which enrolled 
only pregnant women, all of whom were aged 18+ years and at 24-36 weeks gestation when 
vaccinated. The study compared 120 and 240 µg RSVpreF doses, each with and without aluminium 
hydroxide, with placebo. This design allowed evaluation of the possibility that in pregnant women a 
higher dose and/or adjuvanted formulation might improve on the immune responses elicited with the 
selected formulation for older adults (120 µg unadjuvanted) with an acceptable safety profile. 
Transfer of neutralizing antibody across the placenta 
The Phase 2b study C3671003 described anti-RSV NA titres in infants at birth (cord blood) and at 
months 1, 2, 4 and 6 after birth. The applicant calculated the transfer ratios based on titres at delivery. 
The data were then taken into account when selecting the dose for pregnant women.  
Concomitant administrations 
The FIH study C3671001 included an exploration of co-administration with influenza vaccine depending 
on age 18-49 years (standard unadjuvanted QIV) or 65-85 years (HD trivalent vaccine). Additional 
data on co-administration with influenza vaccine came from C3671002 in subjects aged 65-85 years.  
Study C3671004 in non-pregnant women aged 18-49 years assessed co-administration of the selected 
RSVpreF formulation with TdaP.  
Support for a potentially efficacious dose from the human challenge study 
Using a RSV A strain, the study enrolled adults <50 years who received a nasal challenge at 4 weeks 
after receipt of RSVpreF 120 µg unadjuvanted or placebo. In this RSV-experienced population, it was 
expected that not all subjects in the placebo group would develop symptomatic infections. The data 
were analysed using a range of definitions of symptomatic RSV disease and also counting cases with 
detectable or quantifiable RSV in the various calculations of vaccine efficacy.

Phase 3 efficacy study in adults aged from 60 years 
This was the single pivotal vaccine efficacy study to support use in subjects aged from 60 years. The 
study sites covered N. and S. America, two EU countries, S. Africa and Japan. There was stratification 
at site-based randomisation with an aim to recruit at least 6,000 in each of the sub-groups 60-69 and 
70-79 years and at least 800 aged 80+ years. There was also an aim to recruit at least 10% with 
stable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions but those with unstable conditions or known to be 
immunosuppressed were excluded. Generally, the approach taken was acceptable.  
The protocol pre-defined acceptable clinical definitions for RSV-LRTI, RSV severe LRTI (sLRTI) and RSV 
acute respiratory infection (ARI) and required RT-PCR confirmation for RSV. Nevertheless, as these are 
composite endpoints, a descriptive comparison of the different lower respiratory symptoms/signs 
leading to RSV-confirmed (severe) LRTI between groups was provided. For the primary efficacy 
endpoint, only LRTI-RSV with initial symptom onset date between Day 15 (i.e. 14 days after 
vaccination) and the end of the first RSV season was included in the evaluable efficacy population 
analysis. Also, only cases with symptom onset prior to 1 year after the vaccination were included as 
cases in the first RSV season. If the symptom onset is after 1 year, the case was to be counted as 
being in Season 2, even if it occurred before the study surveillance window during Season 2. The 
applicant explained that there was no subject with symptom onset after one-year post-vaccination but 
still within RSV Season 1. Any LRTI-RSV case with a symptom onset date from Day 1 (the day of 
vaccination) was included in the analysis of cases in the mITT population.  
Regarding the respiratory illness visit, which was triggered after the participant experienced 1 or more 
of the ARI symptoms, it is stated in the protocol that this visit might be conducted as a telephone visit 
or a clinic or home visit and would occur optimally within 7 days after the onset of the illness. It is 
unclear how confirmation of respiratory illness and an adequate clinical assessment of the participant 
(including the collection of temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) might have been 
possible via a telephone visit.  The applicant explained that there was no external adjudication 
committee. In addition, it might have been possible that some subjects could have presented/been 
taken by relatives directly to a local healthcare facility. There was no exhaustive trawling for cases and 
there was reliance on subject reporting, supported by the case ascertainment methods put in place. 
While this situation is perhaps not entirely optimal, the study was double-blind in nature.  
This randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to estimate the absolute vaccine 
efficacy of RSVpreF using a case-driven primary analysis based on RSV-LRTI meeting the primary case 
definitions that required ≥2 or ≥3 of the listed symptoms to be present.  
There was a plan for sequential testing of hypotheses such that if the lower bound of the adjusted CI 
around the point estimate of vaccine efficacy was >20% for RSV-LRTI with ≥2 symptoms, then 
efficacy was to be estimated for RSV-LRTI with ≥3 symptoms. If the lower bound of the adjusted CI 
around the point estimate of vaccine efficacy for RSV-LRTI with ≥3 symptoms was >20%, efficacy was 
to be calculated for severe RSV-LRTI, which was designated as a key secondary endpoint and had the 
same criterion for concluding on efficacy. Vaccine efficacy against RSV-ARI was a planned secondary 
analysis but this endpoint was not included in the confirmatory testing strategy. Therefore, the analysis 
of ARI-RSV was descriptive and prevention of ARI-RSV cannot be claimed in the indication.  
The primary analysis method was VE based on the case count ratio using the conditional exact test 
based on the binomial distribution of the number of cases in the RSVpreF group, given the total 
number of cases in both groups, without adjustment for prognostic factors and the calculation assumes 
equal person-time follow-up. The following sensitivity analyses were pre-planned: 1) To assess the 
Assessment report

impact of different person-time follow-up between groups, 2) To assess the assumption that the risk of 
illness is constant over time (Cox regression). The Cox regression relies on the assumption of 
proportional hazards, i.e. that the relative hazards are constant over time. 
The sample size calculation was based on conducting the primary analysis when at least 59 cases of 
RSV-LRTI with ≥2 symptoms had accrued in the efficacy evaluable population. It was calculated that 
~30,000 subjects would be needed to provide 59 such cases, which would then give 90% power to 
demonstrate that the lower bound of the adjusted CI around the point estimate of vaccine efficacy was 
>20% assuming that the observed efficacy was at least 70%. However, there was also a planned 
interim analysis when at least 29 evaluable first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms had been 
accrued. Moreover, the interim analysis was to estimate efficacy against RSV-LRTI with ≥3 symptoms 
if at least 15 cases had accrued and against RSV-sLRTI if 12 cases had accrued. Pocock-adjusted CIs 
were planned to be applied. For 44 cases at interim, the two-sided Type I error would be 0.0334. The 
Pocock-adjusted CIs have a confidence level of 96.66% (=100%-3.34%) which should be correct at an 
information fraction of approximately 0.75. The information fraction at interim for the second and third 
endpoint is unknown as the final analysis is based on the number of events of the first endpoint or the 
end of season 1.   
According to the statistical analysis plan, at the interim analysis the DMC could recommend stopping 
the study for success (other than completing follow-up of recruited subjects) or could recommend 
continuing the study until the target number of 59 cases of RSV-LRTI with ≥2 symptoms had accrued. 
There was no plan or criteria set for possibly stopping the study for futility at the time of the interim 
analysis. While this would have been appropriate, since there was no preliminary assessment of 
efficacy in a prior study, the results of the interim analysis (see below) were favourable. 
Phase 3 efficacy study in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
The Phase 2b study C3671003 evaluated efficacy against RSV in infants as an exploratory endpoint 
and there were very few cases accrued, with no comment possible. Therefore, C3671008 stands alone 
to provide the evidence of vaccine efficacy against RSV disease in infants born to vaccinated mothers. 
In this randomised, double blind and placebo-controlled study, eligible women were to be between 24 
and 36 weeks of gestation based on LMP and the earliest ultrasound conducted with an uncomplicated 
and natural singleton pregnancy. For purposes of providing a population expected to be adherent to 
study procedures, these women were to be attending antenatal care with planned delivery in a 
healthcare facility. This plan was to ensure sample and data collection was as complete as possible. In 
line with the co-administration data, any TdaP administrations were to be at least 14 days prior to or 
after RSVpreF and it seems a 7-day window would have applied in case of influenza vaccination. 
The protocol defined the infant efficacy endpoints in detail, which were acceptable. It should be noted 
that these endpoints all involved medically-attended illnesses, defined by any contact with a healthcare 
professional. By definition, it could happen that severe MA-LRTI cases occur with minimal difference to 
non-severe MA-LRTI.  
A descriptive comparison of the different lower respiratory symptoms/signs leading to RSV-confirmed 
MA-RTI, MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI between groups was provided as requested (analysis of cases 
within 180 days of birth). For severe MA-LRTI cases in both the placebo and RSV-PreF group, the most 
frequent symptoms were SpO2 <93% (61.3% and 68.4%, respectively) and fast breathing (50.0% and 
52.6%, respectively). For MA-LRTI cases, the most frequent symptoms were due to fast breathing 
(64.1% and 57.9%, respectively), chest wall indrawing (44.4% and 40.4%, respectively) or SpO2

<95% (52.1% and 29.8%, respectively). The applicant further clarified that all cases were 
PCR-confirmed, that cases could have had more than one symptom and that for almost all symptoms 
the number of cases with the symptom in the RSVpreF group was less than in the placebo group.  
As the definitions of MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI are based on MA-RTI and additional conditions, the 
unlikely case could occur that a severe MA-LRTI event is not considered a MA-LRTI event. The 
applicant confirmed that any adjudicated severe MA-LRTI case due to RSV was also a MA-LRTI case. 
Active surveillance commenced with weekly contacts from 72 h after birth and continued until month 
6, after which the frequency of contact was reduced to approximately monthly. Care-givers were also 
able to initiate contact with study staff in case of intervening onset of illnesses potentially meeting the 
criteria. 
An EAC adjudicated all RSV-positive MA-RTI cases through the active follow-up period including all 
cases occurring up to 180 days after birth.  
There were multiple primary efficacy objectives applied to infant RSV cases with parallel primary 
efficacy endpoints of MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI for which there was a Bonferroni multiplicity 
adjustment procedure. Success of the study required that the lower bounds of the adjusted CIs around 
the point estimates of vaccine efficacy for either or both endpoints were >20%. Furthermore, for each 
of these primary endpoints, there was sequential testing for vaccine efficacy based on cases that 
occurred up to day 90, day 120, day 150 and day 180 after birth. That is, testing for efficacy beyond 
day 90 required that efficacy was shown based on cases with onset before day 90, and so on for each 
sequential time point.  
A simple 1:1 randomisation between RSVpreF or placebo for study-eligible pregnant women was 
performed. The randomisation was not stratified for any prognostic variables. In this case-driven 
study, based on several assumptions regarding accrual and on 60% vaccine efficacy, 6,900 pregnant 
women were to be enrolled to provide 124 cases of RSV MA-LRTI in their infants with onset within 90 
days of birth ensuring power by the exact binomial test of at least 90%. However, the sample 
size/power calculations did not consider the two possible interim analyses with possible stopping for 
futility or efficacy. 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the evaluable efficacy infant set, which was confined to 
those born at least 14 days after maternal vaccination and excluded any infants who received an 
anti-RSV monoclonal antibody. The analysis was repeated using data from the mITT efficacy infant 
population consisting of all those born to vaccinated maternal participants. This plan was considered 
acceptable. Intercurrent events include the infant receiving palivizumab or another monoclonal 
antibody targeting RSV and the infant receiving transfusions of more than 20 mL/kg of any blood 
products at ≤180 days of age. The applicant planned to use the hypothetical strategy for estimating 
the vaccine efficacy but seems to have excluded all participants with an intercurrent event similar to a 
complete case analysis instead of imputing for these participants (“All post discontinuation or post 
violation observations will be censored”). In a sensitivity analysis, the impact of palivizumab 
administration was analysed using a composite strategy, i.e. the endpoint analysed was occurrence of 
either MA-LRTI due to RSV (as defined for the main analysis) or receipt of palivizumab.  
Where MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI visits had no accompanying valid central RT-PCR or local NAAT 
test results, positive or negative results were imputed. Based on a blinded review of data at the end of 
February 2022, approximately 22% of all swabs from MA-LRTI events with valid central laboratory 
results proved to be RSV-positive so the minority of the missing results was expected to be truly RSV-

positive. For missing RSV swab results which are imputed by multiple imputation under different 
assumptions, Rubin´s Rules were applied to pool parameter estimates and to derive confidence 
intervals for RSV positive MA-LRTI and RSV positive severe MA-LRTI.  
In a further sensitivity analysis, any test indicating positivity for RSV was to be accepted and used to 
define MA-LRTI cases if qualified by clinical symptoms. Examples of positive swab results counted in 
this analysis were local non-NAAT tests, central laboratory PCR tests from samples taken outside the 
protocol-specified window and centrally-tested swabs that exceeded the documented stability testing 
duration but were positive.  
Interim analyses were planned to assess efficacy and safety after at least 43 cases and/or after at 
least 62 cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days of birth had accrued and results could be used for 
internal business decisions regarding study planning, stopping for futility or stopping for early success. 
Only cases that had been fully adjudicated prior to taking a data snapshot were to be included in an 
interim analysis. The analysis of efficacy was to use an O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending rule based on 
the fraction of cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days available. The exact number of cases at 
each interim analysis was not fixed and could be decided based on operational reasons. The first 
interim analysis took place when 56 MA-LRTI cases had accrued through 90 days and the second after 
80 RSV-positive MA-LRTI cases within 90 days after birth. In April 2022, an E-DMC reviewed results of 
the first interim analysis when 56 MA-LRTI cases had accrued through 90 days and recommended 
continuation of the study.  
Testing of the primary endpoints at the interim analysis was to follow the sequence of interval-specific 
tests. Secondary endpoints were not planned to be tested at the interim analyses. Futility was to be 
assessed using conditional power.  
The alpha levels used at interim and final analyses depends on the exact fraction of cases available at 
the interim analysis. The first interim analysis was performed after 56 RSV-positive MA-LRTI cases 
within 90 days after birth and the second interim analysis after 80 RSV-positive MA-LRTI cases within 
90 days after birth. It can be followed that the first interim analysis has a 2-sided alpha of 0.0017. The 
second interim analysis has a 2-sided alpha of 0.010. Using a Bonferroni split, this would lead to 
99.5% CIs (i.e. 1-0.0100/2). Nevertheless, it is not allowed to split the nominal alpha at an interim 
analysis for the two parallel primary endpoints, but a separate group sequential design at 2.5% two-
sided significance level each would be needed. The proposed procedure does not conform with the 
closed testing principle. The applicant claims that the proposed design could control the type I error 
rate due to the inherent conservatism of the exact binomial test. Starting with a procedure based on 
the normal approximation is a useful strategy, but then the precise error rates for that design have to 
be derived by exact calculation. Furthermore, there is no specific case target for the additional primary 
endpoint of severe MA-LRTI and the same information fraction at interim as for MA-LRTI has to be 
assumed. 
As the proposed design by the applicant was not shown to control type I error rate, the confidence 
levels of a design which comes closest to what is proposed, but controls the type I error, would be 
more adequate: A Bonferroni split needs to be performed between the endpoints and then the O’Brien 
Fleming spending functions applied for each endpoint. Assuming the same information fraction for each 
endpoint at interim, the first interim analysis with information fraction 56/124 has a 2-sided alpha of 
0.0004 for each endpoint and the second interim analysis with information fraction 80/124 has a 2-
sided alpha of 0.0036 for each endpoint leading to 99.64% CIs.

It is claimed that since MA-LRTI through 180 days was inspected at the first interim analysis in April 
2022 with a 2-sided alpha of 0.0017, the analysis of the primary endpoints at 120 days and later after 
a successful interim analysis can use a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 - 0.0017 = 0.0483, to be split between 
the endpoints using the Bonferroni correction (1-0.0483/2=0.97585). This is not the correct nominal 
significance level and especially does not apply in case of a second interim analysis. A naive strategy of 
testing other endpoints at full remaining level α whenever the primary endpoint(s) are significant and 
the trial stops does not maintain the overall type I error rate at level α (Hung et al. (J. Biopharm. Stat. 
2007; 17:1201–1210)).   
The applicant recalculated the confidence intervals for both primary endpoints using 99.64% CIs: as no 
case target for RSV-positive severe MA-LRTI was specified the same information fraction at interim for 
RSV-positive severe MA-LRTI as for RSV-positive MA-LRTI is assumed. When assuming minimum 
information fractions of 0.39 and 0.47 (currently 45% and 65% are used), the CI lower bounds are all 
above 20% confirming the robustness of results. 
The confidence level of 99.17% for the secondary endpoints was derived by splitting half of the two-
sided 5% significance level again for the three secondary endpoints (1-0.05/6= 0.9916667). The 
secondary endpoints have to be tested sequentially, at 90 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, and 
360 days for hospitalisation due to RSV and all-cause MA-LRTI and at 210 days, 240 days, 270 days, 
and 360 days for MA-LRTI due to RSV. However, the secondary endpoints were not planned to be 
tested at the interim analysis and the ad-hoc adjustment applied by the applicant is not correct. A 
naive strategy of testing the secondary endpoint family at level α or level α/2 whenever the primary 
endpoint(s) are significant does not maintain the FWER at level α (Hung et al. (J. Biopharm. Stat. 
2007; 17:1201–1210). The simulation provided was considered inadequate. Therefore, the overall 
type I error rate is still not controlled and there is an alpha inflation. As the analysis of all secondary 
endpoints is considered descriptive, 95% CIs were requested and presented by the applicant.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Selection of doses from immunogenicity data 
Immune responses in adults, including older adults 
The FIH study C3671001 suggested that there was no major advantage for the highest dose over the 
middle dose in either age sub-group (18-49 or 50-85 years; median age in the latter was ~71 years). 
While titres against RSV B were slightly higher than against RSV A, neither was significantly improved 
by addition of aluminium hydroxide. The study supported progression with the unadjuvanted 120 μg 
dose in adults regardless of age. Omission of an adjuvant was further supported by the results of study 
C3671002 in older adults, which compared two adjuvanted formulations with no adjuvant. This study 
also reported on CMI, again suggesting no benefit of adjuvantation.  
At month 12, NA titres were still higher in the vaccinated groups vs. the placebo recipients. 
Administration of a further dose of 240 μg resulted in very modest increments in NA in both age 
subgroups, suggesting that repeat vaccination at one year might not lead to any major enhancement 
of protection. It remains to be determined if/when a further dose of vaccine may be potentially useful. 
Immune responses in pregnant women 
The effect of pregnancy on immune responses was not determined in a direct comparison between 
pregnant and non-pregnant women of comparable ages within a single study. C3671003 enrolled ~115

pregnant adult women per dose group, most of whom were recruited in the US. All doses and 
formulations of RSVpreF induced RSV A and RSV B NA50 increments from baseline with higher GMTs in 
the RSVpreF group vs. the placebo group from 2 weeks post-dose (peak titres) until 6 months after 
delivery. Whereas there was some suggestion of an effect of adjuvant in the higher dose group for 
peak titres, there was no appreciable difference between the 120 μg and 240 μg doses. Furthermore, 
at one-month post-dose and at delivery, there was not a consistent advantage for the higher dose or 
for adjuvantation. Furthermore, there was no consistent trend in terms of peak GMTs according to 
gestational age at time of maternal vaccination. Generally, the findings suggested that 120 μg 
unadjuvanted could suffice. 
The actual anti-RSV A and RSV B NA50 GMTs in pregnant women mostly resident in the US who 
received 120 μg unadjuvanted RSVpreF in this study peaked at week 2 with values of 31871 and 
39152, respectively. At one month, the respective GMTs were 24149 and 34397. In non-pregnant 
female subjects in the US aged 18-49 years enrolled into C3671004 and given any of the four RSVpreF 
formulations alone, the pre-vaccination NA50 GMTs for RSV A and RSV B were very similar to those in 
the pregnant women (1582 vs. 1574 in pregnant women for RSV A and 1470 vs. 1756 in pregnant 
women for RSV B). The month 1 NA50 GMTs in non-pregnant women were 22339 and 21509, 
respectively. These month 1 GMTs are also very similar to those reported from the lot consistency 
study C3671014 in US male and female adults aged 18-49 years. While cross-study comparisons must 
be viewed with caution, the data suggest that there is not a negative effect of pregnancy on the 
magnitude of immune response to RSVpreF. 
No immunogenicity data have been reported from pregnant adolescents, although subjects aged from 
16 years received RSVpreF in C3671008 (and subjects from 14 years received placebo). 
With slightly higher immune responses in the younger vs. older adults in the FIH study, and with 
almost everyone RSV-experienced by the age of 2 years, there is no concern on grounds of efficacy 
over using the selected adult dose in pregnant adolescents. Therefore, the applicant’s indication for use 
in pregnant individuals without specifying a lower age for use could be acceptable.  
Transfer of neutralizing antibody across the placenta 
In C3671003, the median gestational age of infants at birth was 39 weeks (range 31-42 weeks). The 
statistical analysis plan and table footnotes for C3671003 do not actually specify how the transfer ratio 
was calculated. However, the statistical analysis plan for C3671008 specifies that the transfer ratios 
are based on NA50 titres in infants and their mothers at the time of delivery. Assuming this also applied 
in C3671003, the transfer ratios were in the range 1.3 to 1.9 and were broadly similar for NA50 against 
RSV A and B as well as between the four RSVpreF groups and the placebo group (i.e. transfer ratio for 
naturally acquired maternal antibody). The anti-RSV A and B NA50 GMTs in infants at birth were broadly 
comparable across the four RSVpreF groups and >10-fold the GMTs for infants born to unvaccinated 
mothers. There were at least 8-fold differences for corresponding GMTs at one month of age and at 
least 5-fold differences at 6 months of age.  
With the majority of mothers enrolled in the US, it is not possible to conclude on transfer ratios by 
hemisphere. When examined by gestation duration at vaccination across the range 27-36 weeks, there 
was no consistent trend regarding transfer ratios. The relatively few data on infants born within 14 
days of maternal vaccination did suggest lower transfer ratios but the transfer ratios for those born 
<30 or >30 days from time of maternal vaccination in the 120 μg unadjuvanted group and placebo 
group suggested higher transfer ratios for those born within 30 days.

At month 6 the GMTs for RSV A and B for infants born to mothers who had received 120 μg 
unadjuvanted RSVpreF (1529 and 1609, respectively) were ~7-fold those for infants born to mothers 
assigned to placebo (233 and 221, respectively). In the infants born to mothers given 120 μg 
unadjuvanted RSVpreF, these month 6 GMTs of 1529 and 1609 resembled the pre-vaccination GMTs of 
their RSV-experienced mothers (1574 and 1756, respectively). As mentioned above, while there was 
some suggestion of an effect of adjuvant in the higher dose group for peak titres in pregnant women, 
this did not translate into higher GMTs in their infants. These findings supported selection of the 120 
μg unadjuvanted dose for pregnant women. 
Concomitant administrations 
In the FIH study, there was no consistent negative effect of co-administration of 240 μg RSVpreF with 
seasonal influenza vaccines on the immune responses to RSVpreF. However, co-administration gave a 
general trend to lower HAI titres especially in the younger age subgroup, noting that the two age 
subgroups received different seasonal influenza vaccines. Additional data for HD seasonal influenza 
vaccine in subjects aged 65-85 years in C3671002 suggested no major effect of RSVpreF co-
administration on HAI titres in this age range.   
To further investigate co-administration with seasonal influenza vaccines, the applicant conducted a 
Phase 3 study C3671006 in ~1400 healthy Australian adults aged 65+ years who received RSVpreF + 
SIIV together or in a staggered fashion. Data from this study were provided at day 91 and indicated a 
consistent numerical reduction in GMTs for NA against RSV A and B as well as for HAI titres on co-
administration of RSVPreF with an adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine 
although all the lower bounds of the 95% CI around the GMT ratios exceeded 0.67. Overall, there is no 
reason to preclude co-administration of RSVpreF with SIIV but section 4.5 needs to be re-worded to 
reflect the evidence provided.  
In non-pregnant women aged 18-49 years, co-administration with Tdap was initially analysed using 
data from the combined RSVpreF groups (i.e. 240 µg adjuvanted and 120 µg unadjuvanted RSVpreF 
combined) vs. the placebo group. The data for the combined RSVpreF groups and for the selected 
RSVpreF formulation group compared to respective groups that received concomitant Tdap indicated 
no negative effect on anti-RSV A and B NA based on the pre-defined non-inferiority criteria.  
For anti-T and anti-D, the majority of subjects already had >0.1 IU/mL prior to vaccination, which 
somewhat limits any conclusion based on results that showed the pre-defined non-inferiority criteria 
were met. For proportions with >1.0 IU/mL anti-D, there was an imbalance between groups at pre-
vaccination with 26% and 18% in the RSVpreF and placebo groups, respectively. At post-vaccination, 
the proportions were 51% vs. 77%, which raises some potential that RSVpreF exerts negative 
interference on the anti-D response.  
Furthermore, the comparison of proportions with at least 1.0 IU/mL anti-D made between the selected 
RSVpreF formulation (120 μg) and the placebo group (Tdap alone) suggested a negative effect of co-
administration (from 24% to 53% in the co-administration group vs. 17.9% to 77% in the Tdap alone 
group). The GMCs and RCDs are not included in the CSR. 
Using the combined results from RSVpreF groups, non-inferiority was not shown for anti-PT, anti-FHA 
and anti-PRN immune responses since the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the GMC ratios of 
the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups to the placebo/Tdap group did not exceed 0.67 (they ranged from 
0.48 to 0.64). When the comparison was made between the selected RSVpreF formulation and Tdap 
alone, the lower bounds of the CIs were 0.68 for anti-PT, 0.52 for anti-FHA and 0.45 for anti-PRN. In

the Phase 3 study C3671008 at least 2 weeks was to elapse between administration of RSVpreF and 
Tdap. Section 4.5 of the SmPC should advise that at least 2 weeks elapse between administrations of 
RSVpreF and TdaP. 
Selection of a potentially efficacious dose from the human challenge study 
Of the 31 subjects challenged per group and applying various definitions of symptomatic infection as 
well as considering those with detectable or quantifiable RSV as cases in different analyses, <60% in 
the placebo group were counted as cases in the different calculations of vaccine efficacy.  
Regardless of the case definition applied, the estimates of RSVpreF efficacy were from 86.7% to 100% 
and the lower bounds of the 95% CI around these estimates all fell above 53%. Correspondingly, prior 
vaccination was shown to reduce viral loads in nasal washes (based on qRT-PCR) and to reduce the 
overall symptom scores.  
In these UK residents, selected for having pre-study NA titres in the lowest quartile, the pre-
vaccination and pre-challenge (i.e. one month post-vaccination) RSV A NA50 GMTs were lower than 
those recorded in pregnant women in C3671003 (mostly enrolled in the US) while the RSV B GMTs 
were only slightly lower. The same pattern applied when comparing NA50 GMTs between these UK 
subjects and the younger cohort of male and non-pregnant female US subjects in the same age range 
who received the 120 μg unadjuvanted formulation in C3671001.  
In the older cohort in C3671001 (50-85 years; again, US only), the pre-vaccination NA50 GMTs were 
higher than in the younger cohort while the GMTs at one month in the group that received the 120 μg 
unadjuvanted formulation were very similar to those in the younger cohort in the same study. In these 
older US subjects, the month one post-vaccination RSV A NA50 GMT was higher than for UK subjects 
but the RSV B NA50 GMTs were broadly comparable.   
Generally, the data on vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infections in adults 18-50 years gives 
support to the selection of the 120 μg RSVpreF formulation for pregnant women and for older adults.  
An interesting observation from the RSV A and B NA50 GMTs in these UK adults is that the GMTs 
dropped from pre-challenge to day 12 and onwards post-challenge, so exposure to the challenge strain 
did not further augment the systemic humoral response. In contrast, challenge with RSV A did result in 
increases in GMTs for RSV A and B in the placebo group at day 12, followed by a decline thereafter. 
However, the day 12 GMTs in the placebo group were still lower (~10%) than the day 12 GMTs in the 
vaccinated group.  
Phase 3 efficacy study in adults aged from 60 years 
By mid-July 2022, more than 34,000 subjects had been randomised and treated and 94% were still 
being followed in the study. Most of the withdrawals were due to the subject and there were no 
important differences in rates or reasons for withdrawal between the vaccine and placebo groups. The 
majority (>22,000; ~60%) was enrolled in N. America, followed by ~8000 (~21%) in Argentina. Only 
~1000 (~3%) were enrolled in S. Africa. While the majority was aged 60-69 years (~21,000), 
~11,000 were aged 70-79 years and >900 subjects in each group (~6%) was 80+ years. Just over 
half had at least one of the pre-specified significant underlying conditions.  
Although 213 (0.6%) subjects somehow managed to enrol at more than one site, and so received 
more than one dose of assigned treatment, these subjects were balanced between the two groups and 
Assessment report

were removed from the primary analysis population. Other important protocol deviations were also 
balanced between treatment groups, noting that those who received assigned treatment that had not 
been stored adequately were removed from the primary analysis population. The poor protocol 
adherence at site 1227 did not affect the analyses of efficacy since no cases were reported from this 
site. Ultimately, 95% of randomised subjects in each group were eligible for the evaluable efficacy 
population.    
The latest version of the SAP (version 4) was dated on 22 Jul 2022 and thus after the cut-off dates for 
the study report.  
The applicant states that the data snapshot for the 13 July 2022 data cut-off occurred on 
05 August 2022, i.e. after the SAP amendment and the SAP change was not informed by study results. 
The planned interim efficacy analysis was conducted when 44 first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 
symptoms had accrued in the first RSV season through the surveillance cut-off date of 08 July 2022.  
At this time, the mean surveillance duration was 206 days in both treatment groups. All study 
participants remained in blinded follow-up after the interim analysis. Based on this analysis, vaccine 
efficacy was 66.7% with a lower bound of the 96.66% CI >28%. The graphical display of cases 
indicates that the benefit of RSVpreF was apparent very shortly after commencement of active 
surveillance and, based on available follow-up data, was maintained at one year. 
The majority of cases was due to RSV B and the study was not powered for efficacy analyses by 
subtype. Nevertheless, using the standard method of calculating vaccine efficacy, the point estimates 
and 96.66% CI were 88.9 (10.6, 99.8) for RSV A and 56.5 (-0.7, 82.8) for RSV B. The inconsistency in 
results for the RSV A and RSV B subgroups for LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms was not observed 
for LRTI-RSV cases with ≥3 symptoms or ARI. Therefore, the numerical differences on point estimate 
of subgroup A and subgroup B for LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms at interim analysis were 
attributed to the small case numbers. 
In the evaluable efficacy population there were 45 participants with 46 episodes of LRTI-RSV cases 
with ≥2 symptoms reported after vaccination (Day 1). Therefore, one participant experienced, 2 
episodes within one RSV season. The applicant explained that the participant who experienced two 
LRTI episodes within one RSV season was in the placebo group and had an ongoing medical history of 
asthma and allergic rhinitis. The two episodes were divided by a symptom free period of 8 days, which 
by definition in the SAP specifies them as two different episodes. However, it is agreed that this might 
represent a single episode of a respiratory illness. 
There were 16 first-episode RSV-LRTI cases with ≥3 symptoms, reported as the first episode from Day 
15 (1 episode was reported before Day 15), using the same cut-off date, so the interim analysis of that 
endpoint was conducted at the same time as for RSV-LRTI cases with ≥2 symptoms. With only 2/16 
cases in the RSVpreF group, vaccine efficacy was 85.7% and the lower bound of the 96.66% CI was 
32%. Of the 16 cases, 11 were due to RSV B, with vaccine efficacy at 90% (96.66% CI 21.8, 99.8). 
For RSV A, it can only be observed that 3 of the 4 cases occurred in the placebo group. The benefit of 
vaccination for this endpoint was apparent from ~day 45 post-vaccination onwards and was 
maintained using all available one-year follow-up data. 
The exploration of vaccine efficacy against RSV-LRTI in subgroups gave point estimates (noting that 
the CIs were wide or very wide and the lower bound was >0 only for Whites, which accounted for the 
majority of the study population) that suggested no important effect of gender and no decrease in 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 112/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy with increasing age. The point estimate for vaccine efficacy was <0 only for Black or African 
American subjects.  
Overall, the interim analysis demonstrated that RSVpreF is efficacious in preventing RSV-LRTI from 
day 15 post-vaccination onwards. The number of cases of severe RSV-LRTI accrued as of the cut-off 
date was <12 so no analysis was conducted and no claim for prevention of severe cases is made by 
the applicant. In any case, efficacy against severe RSV-LRTI can only be determined from the 
proportion of breakthrough cases of RSV-LRTI in the vaccine (total 11) and placebo (total 33) groups 
that met the criteria for classification as severe. The higher the vaccine efficacy, the less likely it is that 
any severe cases will occur in vaccinated individuals. Moreover, the shorter median duration per 
episode (10.5 days among vaccine breakthrough cases compared to 15.5 days for placebo group 
cases) points to some amelioration effect in the vaccine group. The applicant provided the planned 
analysis of vaccine efficacy against the secondary endpoint of severe RSV-LRTI. There were only two 
severe LRTI-RSV cases, both in the Placebo group. Due to the low number of cases, the estimated VE 
of 100% is not robust and no meaningful conclusion on VE against severe cases can be drawn. 
Having reached the success criteria for the primary analyses of RSV-LRTI, the applicant analysed the 
secondary endpoint of RSV-ARI. With 22 RSVpreF vs. 58 placebo group cases, the point estimate of 
vaccine efficacy was 62% and the lower bound of the 95% CI was 37%, which supports a conclusion 
that RSVpreF also has an effect on preventing any RSV ARI cases. The results by RSV subtype 
supported an effect on RSV ARI due to RSV A or B although, again, for RSV A this is based on the 
numerical difference in small numbers. However, this was a secondary analysis for which the study 
was not powered and for which there is no evidence that Type 1 error was controlled.  
Follow-up of the study population was ongoing at the time of filing the MAA. In the responses at day 
91, the applicant provided data for the end of season 1 (EOS1) analysis. There were 15 first-episode 
LRTI-RSV cases with ≥2 symptoms in the RSVpreF group and 43 in the placebo group in the evaluable 
efficacy population that occurred from Day 15, corresponding to a VE of 65.1% (95% CI: 35.9%, 
82.0%) for RSVpreF based on the risk ratio. For RSV A, VE for LRTI-RSV with ≥2 symptoms was 
81.3% (95% CI: 34.5%, 96.5%) based on 3 cases in the RSVpreF group and 16 cases in the placebo 
group. For RSV B, VE for LRTI-RSV with ≥2 symptoms was 53.8% (95% CI: 5.2%, 78.8%) based on 
12 cases in the RSVpreF group and 26 cases in the placebo group. 
Through the EOS1, there were 2 first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥3 symptoms in the RSVpreF group 
and 18 in the placebo group in the evaluable efficacy population that occurred from Day 15, 
corresponding to a VE of 88.9% (95% CI: 53.6%, 98.7%) for RSVpreF based on risk ratio. For RSV A, 
VE for LRTI-RSV with ≥3 symptoms was 80.0% (95% CI: -78.5%, 99.6%) based on 1 case in the 
RSVpreF group and 5 cases in the placebo group. For RSV B, VE for LRTI-RSV with ≥3 symptoms was 
91.7% (95% CI: 43.7%, 99.8%) based on 1 case in the RSVpreF group and 12 cases in the placebo 
group. 
It was concluded that the VE estimated from the EOS1 analysis was similar to VE at interim analysis 
for both LRTI-RSV with ≥2 symptoms and ≥3 symptoms. 
In addition, the applicant provided the immunogenicity subset results. The immunogenicity subset 
included participants enrolled only from the US and Japan and sera were not obtained from a randomly 
selected subset. In the RSVpreF group, geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) of neutralizing titres (NTs) 
for RSV A, RSV B, and combined RSV A/B were 11.6, 12.7, and 12.1, respectively. GMFRs were close 
to 1 in the placebo group, indicating negligible change from baseline.  
For subgroup analyses by sex, GMFRs of NTs for RSV A, RSV B, and combined RSV A/B trended higher 
for females (range: 14.1 to 14.8) than males (range: 10.4 to 11.7). For age group, race and 
prespecified significant conditions, neutralizing antibody GMTs and GMFRs for RSV A, RSV B and 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 113/151 
 
 
 
 
combined RSV A/B were generally similar to those observed in the main analyses and did not identify 
any clinically meaningful differences between subgroups (for those with enough participants for the 
analysis). At baseline and 1-month after vaccination time points, GMTs were lower for participants who 
were Non-Hispanic/Non-Latino versus Hispanic/Latino and for Japanese versus US subjects. 
When also viewed in light of the subgroup analyses of efficacy, there were no concerns raised by the 
immunogenicity data reported overall or by subgroup. 
Phase 3 efficacy study in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
The results reported in the CSR of December 2022 reflect the second interim efficacy analysis, which 
was conducted following the predicted end of the fourth RSV season and included 80 evaluable cases 
of MA-LRTI due to RSV with onset within 90 days of birth, of which 39 were severe MA-LRTI.  
The results led the E-DMC to recommend stopping the study because the success criterion was met for 
one of the two primary efficacy endpoints. At the time of data cut-off, >75% of the 7392 pregnant 
women had completed the study and almost 80% of their infants had completed at least to month 6.  
Only cases that had been fully adjudicated prior to taking a data snapshot were included in an interim 
analysis.  
Enrolment for maternal participants was completed on 03 Oct 2022, i.e. after the data cut-off on 30 
Sep 2022 used for the second interim analysis. The participants already vaccinated and randomised 
were still followed-up for study completion after the decision to stop study recruitment. The applicant 
provided the final results of analyses including all participants recruited and randomised. 
Just over half of the adolescent and adult females (aged from 14-47 years) had been vaccinated 
between weeks 24 and 32 and ~45% between weeks 32-36. In this global study, the majority was 
White and Caucasian, reflecting the fact that the majority was enrolled in the US. Most infants were 
born at term (≥93.7% born at ≥37 weeks to <42 weeks) while most of the pre-term infants were 
near-term at birth (≥4.4% were ≥34 to <37 weeks GA). Less than 2% were excluded from the 
primary analysis because they were born less than 2 weeks after maternal vaccination. For maternal 
participants, non-study vaccines most commonly received in the antenatal period were Tdap-
containing vaccines (48.5%), inactivated influenza vaccines (28.6%) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines 
(25.1%). 
Of the 80 cases of RSV MA-LRTI with onset within 90 days of birth, 24 occurred in infants born to 
mothers given RSVpreF and 56 to mothers given placebo, giving a point estimate of vaccine efficacy at 
57.1% and 99.5% CI 14.7, 79.8. Thus, the pre-defined lower bound criterion for success (>20%) was 
not met even though the lower bound was compatible with a conclusion of superiority for maternal 
vaccination vs. no vaccination. Although it was understood from the protocol that testing at sequential 
time points would not occur if the pre-defined criterion for success was not met at the prior time point, 
the CSR shows sequential analyses. The point estimate of vaccine efficacy remained >50% at days 
120, 150 and 180 although there was a small decline to 51.3% at day 180 and the lower bounds of the 
97.58% CI were from 28-31%. A time-trend of decreasing VE is observed in the point estimates of the 
different observation times. The graphical display showed separation of the curves from ~2 weeks 
after birth onwards. Results for the mITT population were similar.  
As confidence levels of 99.5% were wrongly calculated, the applicant recalculated the confidence 
intervals for both primary endpoints using 99.64% CIs. Concerning the fulfilment of success criteria 
not much changes, MA-LRTI has a lower bound of the 99.64% CI less than 20% for 90d, but higher for 
120d, 150d and 180d, all lower bounds are higher than 0%. For the severe MA-LRTI endpoint, the 
success criterion of a lower bound of the CI greater than 20% was met for all time-points with this 
wider CI. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 114/151 
 
 
 
 
Since the overall type I error rate was not controlled for the RSV-positive MA-LRTI endpoint at the 
later time-points, it cannot be guaranteed that observed data are not chance results. For MA-LRTI due 
to RSV within 210, 240, 270 and 360 days after birth, the statistical criterion for success for this 
endpoint (a CI lower bound >0%) was met using 99.17% CIs.  
When all positive RSV tests were considered, including non-NAAT tests, the results were similar to the 
primary analysis, i.e. success criterion not met at day 90 but met thereafter. After imputation of swab 
results using the missing-at-random assumption, 17.2% of the 90-day result imputations had a 99.5% 
CI lower bound >20%. Using Rubin´s Rules to derive estimates and confidence intervals with multiple 
imputation under the MAR assumption, the lower bounds of the CIs for the RSV positive MA-LRTI 
endpoint are higher due to the higher number of events. Even the LB at 90 days is >20% for both the 
95% and the 99.5% confidence levels, but slightly less than 20% for the 99.64% confidence level. 
With multiple imputation under MNAR, the lower bounds of the CIs are still >0%, but the LBs of the 
99.64% CIs get below 20% almost right away with higher vaccine group positivity rates. For missing 
RSV swab results which are imputed by multiple imputation, robustness of results was shown for the 
RSV positive severe MA-LRTI endpoint. 
Of the 80 cases of RSV MA-LRTI with onset within 90 days, 39 (6 in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
and 33 in those born to unvaccinated mothers) met the criteria for severe cases. Vaccine efficacy 
against severe RSV MA-LRTI fell from 81.8% at day 90 to 69.4% at day 180 but the lower bounds of 
the 99.5% and 97.58% CIs were >40% at each time point and the 99.64% CIs were >30% at each 
time point till day 180. Results were similar for the mITT population. When all positive RSV tests were 
considered, including non-NAAT tests, results were similar to the primary analysis. The analyses based 
on imputations of missing swab results also supported the primary analysis.  
At Day 129, the applicant proposed a revised indication for prevention of lower respiratory tract 
disease caused by RSV in infants from birth through the first RSV season, which is based on numbers 
of cases accrued beyond day 180. For severe MA-LRTI the endpoints beyond 180 days were only 
exploratory study endpoints. The secondary endpoints MA-LRTI beyond 180d were not planned to be 
tested at an interim analysis according to protocol or SAP.  Study RTI visits were performed until at 
least 6 months after delivery for MA-RTIs of any severity, and from 6 months through study 
completion for MA-RTI events that resulted in hospitalisation or met severe criteria. After Visit 3 at 
month 6, the study schedule mentions only a visit or telephone contact at 12, 18 and 24 months; there 
is no indication how cases occurring after the end of active surveillance at month 6 was captured. 
Maternal antibody was not expected to persist in infants beyond 3-6 months. To claim protection from 
birth through the first season of RSV in the EU, where the disease is strongly seasonal in nature, the 
data would have to cover an infant born in ~April of year 1 to the end of the Year 1/year 2 season the 
following April, i.e. over ~365 days. Therefore, it was not agreed that a claim can be made in section 
4.1 that such a duration of protection is achieved.   
The subgroup analyses must be viewed with caution due to small or very small denominators in many 
cases. There appeared to be at least a numerical benefit for RSVpreF for RSV MA-LRTI regardless of 
maternal vaccination between weeks 24-28, 28-32 or 32-36 weeks of gestation. However, VE for 
infants born to mothers given the vaccine in the period 24-28 weeks of gestation was substantially 
lower compared to those immunised after week 28. This information should not preclude use before 28 
weeks but the data have been described in section 5.1. 
When viewed by country, the largest proportion of pregnant women was enrolled in the US, where 17 
cases accrued (2 RSV Pre F) by day 90, giving a point estimate of vaccine efficacy against RSV MA-
LRTI at 86.8% (95% CI 43.4, 98.5). There were no cases recorded in several participating countries 
before day 90, possibly reflecting the success of COVID-19 restrictions and parental caution. Whereas 
similar numbers were enrolled in Argentina and S. Africa, vaccine efficacy by day 90 was shown only in 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 115/151 
 
 
 
Argentina (65.5%; 15.1, 87.7) and there was no apparent benefit in S. Africa (with 8 cases in the 
vaccine group and 6 cases in the placebo group). Moreover, these day 90 data led to a clear picture of 
vaccine efficacy shown only in the upper income countries.  
However, as time passed and cases accumulated, a numerical benefit for infants born to vaccinated 
mothers began to emerge in several countries with no or very few cases at earlier time points and case 
rates were lower vs. placebo group infants even in S. Africa. Also, breastfeeding did not seem to have 
an important effect on vaccine efficacy. When efficacy against RSV A and B was evaluated separately, 
the majority of cases were due to RSV B, in keeping with C3671013 in older adults. For cumulative 
cases up to day 180, efficacy against RSV MA-LRTI was ~27% for RSV A (19 vs. 26 cases) and ~56% 
for RSV B (38 vs. 87 cases). However, efficacy against severe RSV MA-LRTI was 50% for RSV A (7 vs. 
14 cases) and 75% for RSV B (11 vs. 44 cases).  
The RSV A subgroup has a consistently lower VE compared to the RSV B subgroup for both MA-LRTI 
and severe MA-LRTI. In addition, in infants born to RSVPreF vaccinated mothers (in study -003) 50% 
neutralizing GMTs at birth were lower against RSV-A (GMT (95% CI) of 22904 (18639; 28148)) 
compared to RSV-B (GMT (95% CI) of 30195 (24309; 37506)). Nevertheless, point estimates are 
directionally favorable for both RSV subgroups and in the absence of a threshold of protection 
differences in neutralizing titers against RSV A and B are difficult to interpret clinically. It should be 
noted that the RSV subgroup was not determined for all cases that met the clinical criteria and were 
laboratory-confirmed. It cannot be ruled out that some bias could have occurred in reporting of 
subtypes depending on the assay performance (e.g. if subtyping required a minimum amount of virus 
to be present and viral load was more likely to be higher in infants born to mothers given placebo). 
With even fewer cases of severe RSV MA-LRTI recorded, even greater caution is required when viewing 
the subgroup analyses. However, a similar pattern emerged, with a numerical benefit evident even in 
S. Africa especially from D120 onwards.

Population 60+ years of age 
In Study C3671013, 17,215 participants received RSVpreF 120 μg and 17,069 received placebo. As of 
the cut-off date, 13,273 (77.1%) and 13,122 (76.9%) in respective groups had completed the 6-
month safety follow-up visit. Analyses of reactogenicity were based on the e-diary subset safety 
population (3,630 RSVpreF: 3,539 placebo), consisting of all participants included in the reactogenicity 
subset who received the study intervention and with at least 1 day of e-diary data transferred. 
Pregnant women 
Among pregnant individuals, 4144 received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF and 3797 received 
RSVpreF 120 μg. The median follow-up time after vaccination was 8.13 months (range: 0-20) and ≥6 
months follow-up safety data were available for 3637 (87.8%). 
There were 3682 live infants born to mothers who received RSVpreF 120 μg. The median follow-up 
time after birth was 11.70 months (range: 0-24.3) and ≥6 months follow-up safety data were 
available for 3069 (83.4%).

Adverse events within 7 days after vaccination 
Older Adults  
The proportion that reported local reactions within 7 days after vaccination was higher in the RSVpreF 
group (12.1%) compared to the placebo group (6.6%). The most frequently reported local reaction in 
both groups was pain at the injection site, reported by 10.5% in the RSVpreF group and 6.0% in the 
placebo group. Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. A total of 8 (0.2%) and 2 
(<0.1%) participants in the RSVpreF and placebo groups, respectively, reported severe local reactions. 
Observations generally suggested no clinically meaningful differences by subgroup. Any local reaction 
was reported by 15.7% of females vs. 8.8% of males in the RSVpreF group whereas rates in the 
placebo group were 6.4% vs. 6.9%, respectively. The reporting rates were higher for females than 
males in the RSVpreF group for each type of local reaction.

The proportions that reported systemic reactions within 7 days after vaccination were similar in the 
RSVpreF (27.4%) and placebo (25.7%) groups. The most frequently reported was fatigue (15.5% in 
the RSVpreF group and 14.4% in the placebo group). Most systemic reactions were mild or moderate 
in severity. The proportions with severe systemic reactions were similar in the RSVpreF (0.7%) and 
placebo (0.6%) groups. The most frequently reported severe systemic reaction in both groups was 
fatigue (≤0.3% across both groups).

The incidence of fever was low (1.4% of participants in each group) and most reports of fever were 
mild (≥38.0°C to 38.4°C) or moderate (>38.4°C to 38.9°C) in severity. 
The reporting rate for any systemic event was higher for females (32.6%) than males (22.7%) in the 
RSVpreF group. This pattern was also observed in the placebo group (29.8% of females vs. 21.6% of 
males). Results for each type of systemic reaction were similar for the RSVpreF and placebo groups.

Safety Population 
Pregnant individuals 
For any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions reporting local reactions within 7 days after 
vaccination were 43.3% in the pooled RSVpreF group vs. 10.5% in the placebo group. The most 
frequently reported local reaction in both groups was injection site pain (41.5% in the pooled RSVpreF 
group and 10.2% in the placebo group). Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. There 
were 14 (0.3%) participants in the pooled RSVpreF group and none in the placebo group that reported 
severe local reactions. 
The safety profile of RSVpreF 120 μg in pregnant women was similar to that observed in pregnant 
women who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF. Also, reporting rates were comparable 
between pregnant and non-pregnant women.

For those who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the reporting rates for systemic 
reactions within 7 days after vaccination were 65.0% in the pooled RSVpreF group and 60.1% in the 
placebo group. The most frequently reported systemic reaction was fatigue (46.3% in the pooled 
RSVpreF group and 43.9% in the placebo group), but it should be noted that fatigue was reported at 
similar rates in both groups before and after vaccination in C3671008. Most systemic reactions were 
mild or moderate in severity while proportions with severe systemic reactions were similar in the 
pooled RSVpreF (2.4%) and placebo (2.4%) groups. The incidence of fever was low and similar for 
both groups (≤2.9%) and most reports were ≤38.9°C. Muscle pain was reported more frequently in 
the RSVpreF group (27.5%) compared to the placebo group (17.0%), as was headache (31.2% vs. 
27.5%). The safety profile of RSVpreF 120 μg was similar to that observed in those who received any 
dose level/formulation of RSVpreF.

Overview of Adverse Events by Category 
Older Adults  
The proportions reporting any AEs within 1 month after vaccination were similar in the RSVpreF (9.0%) 
and the placebo (8.5%) groups. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity and severe AEs were 
reported in ≤0.4% in both groups. AEs assessed as related by the investigator were reported in 1.4% 
of the RSVpreF group and 1.0% of the placebo group. SAEs, AEs leading to death, life-threatening AEs, 
AEs leading to withdrawal, immediate AEs and NDCMCs were reported in ≤0.6% across both groups. 
For most subgroups, results in the RSVpreF and placebo groups suggested no clinically meaningful 
differences across subgroups. In the RSVpreF group the proportion reporting SAEs was higher for those 
≥80 years (1.3%) than 60-69 years (0.5%) and 70-79 years (0.7%) whereas in the placebo group 
SAE reporting was similar by age subgroup (range: 0.4% - 0.6%). No SAEs were assessed as related 
in those aged ≥80 years in either group.  
Table 49: Adverse Events, by Category, Reported From Vaccination Through the 1-Month Follow-Up 
Visit – Safety Population 
For AEs reported from vaccination through the data cut-off date, the proportions reporting any AEs 
were similar for the RSVpreF group (13.0%) and placebo group (12.8%). Most AEs were mild or 
moderate in both groups (≤1.4% reported as severe). AEs assessed as related by the investigator 
were reported in 1.4% of the RSVpreF group and 1.0% of the placebo group. Across both groups, SAEs 
and NDCMCs were reported in ≤2.3% and ≤1.8%, respectively; AEs leading to deaths, life-threatening 
AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal and immediate AEs were reported in ≤0.6% each. 
As of the data cut-off (14 July 2022), NDCMCs reported after vaccination were balanced for the 
RSVpreF and placebo groups (1.7% vs. 1.8% overall); none of the events in the RSVpreF group and 1 
in the placebo group were assessed as related. NDCMCs were most frequently reported (0.3% in each 
group) in the SOCs of Metabolism and nutrition disorders and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders.

Pregnant individuals 
For any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions reporting any AEs within 1 month after 
vaccination were similar in the pooled RSVpreF (15.0%) and the placebo (13.5%) groups. AEs 
assessed as related by the investigator were reported in 0.4% of the pooled RSVpreF group and 0.2% 
of the placebo group. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity; severe AEs were reported by similar 
proportions in the RSVpreF (1.7%) and placebo (1.3%) groups. SAEs were reported in 4.0% of the 
pooled RSVpreF group and 3.7% of the placebo group. AEs leading to deaths, life-threatening AEs, AEs 
leading to withdrawal and immediate AEs were reported in ≤0.5% across both groups.  
For those who received RSVpreF 120 μg, the safety profile was similar to that for any dose 
level/formulation of RSVpreF.  
For those who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions reporting any AEs from 
vaccination through the data cut-off date were slightly higher in the pooled RSVpreF (30.7%) and the 
placebo (27.8%) groups. AEs assessed as related by the investigator were reported in 0.4% of the 
pooled RSVpreF group and 0.2% of the placebo group. Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity; 
severe AEs were reported by similar proportion in the RSVpreF (5.7%) and placebo (5.5%) groups. 
SAEs were reported in 15.8% of the pooled RSVpreF group and 15.1% of the placebo group. AEs 
leading to deaths, life-threatening AEs and AEs leading to withdrawal were reported in ≤1.6% in both 
groups.

Among pregnant individuals who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the median interval 
between vaccination and delivery was similar between the pooled RSVpreF and placebo groups (55.0 
days). Most (70.9% in the RSVpreF group and 70.4% in the placebo group) had a vaginal delivery and 
the median GA at delivery was 39.14 weeks for both groups. Overall, the majority of pregnancies in 
both groups (99.8%) resulted in full-term live births. The incidence of still births (also reported 
interchangeably as fetal deaths in C3671008) was 0.2% in the pooled RSVpreF and placebo groups. 
Infants born to vaccinated mothers 
In C3671008, for each category of AE reported within 1 month after birth, proportions were similar for 
infants born to mothers in the RSVpreF 120 µg and placebo groups. The proportions with any AE 
reported within 1 month after birth were 37.1% in the RSVpreF group and 34.5% in the placebo group. 
Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity across both groups; severe AEs were reported in ≤4.5%. 
No ADRs were identified in infant participants born to vaccinated mothers in C3671008. 
Table 54: Number (%) of Participants Reporting Adverse Events by Category Within 1 Month After 
Birth – Infant Participants – Safety Population 
Among infants born to mothers who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions 
experiencing any AEs from birth through the data cut-off date were 44.8% in the pooled RSVpreF 
group and 40.7% in the placebo group.   
AEs assessed as related by the investigator were similar between RSVpreF and placebo groups 
(<0.1%). Most AEs were mild or moderate in severity; severe AEs were similar in the RSVpreF (5.5%)

and placebo (4.6%) groups. SAEs were reported in 19.5% of the pooled RSVpreF group and 18.0% of 
the placebo group. AEs leading to deaths, life-threatening AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal were 
reported in ≤1.3% across both groups. Congenital anomalies were reported in ≤7.1% across both 
groups. Developmental delays were reported at a similar frequency in the RSVpreF and placebo groups 
(0.3%). 
As of the data cut-off date, there were 10 (0.2%) fetal demises (including stillbirths) in the RSVpreF 
any dose level/formulation group and 9 (0.2%) in the placebo group. None of the fetal demises was 
assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention. The incidence rate of fetal demises in 
maternal participants who received RSVpreF any dose level or formulation was consistent with or lower 
than estimated background rates.  
Congenital anomalies were reported at a similar frequency in the RSVpreF and placebo groups (6.3%). 
Developmental delays were reported in <0.1% of the pooled RSVpreF group and 0% of the placebo 
group.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Older Adult Population 
From vaccination through the 1-month follow-up visit, for the RSVpreF and placebo groups there were 
few severe AEs (0.4% vs. 0.3%) or life-threatening AEs (0.1% vs. 0.1%) reported. Those assessed as 
related included 2 severe events (viral infection in placebo group, SAE of Miller Fisher syndrome in 
RSVpreF group) and 1 life-threatening event (SAE of GBS in the RSVpreF group); see below. No 
additional AEs of GBS or Miller Fisher syndrome were reported in the study as of the data cut-off date.  
As of the data cut-off (14 July 2022), AEs leading to death were reported in 52 (0.3%) RSVpreF 
recipients and 49 (0.3%) placebo recipients. None of these deaths was assessed as related to study 
intervention. The primary causes of death most frequently reported were in the SOC of Cardiac 
disorders for participants in the RSVpreF (20 [0.1%]) and placebo (19 [0.1%]) groups. 
The proportions with SAEs reported from vaccination through the 6-month follow-up visit were similar 
in the RSVpreF (1.9%) and placebo (1.7%) groups. The most frequently reported for RSVpreF were in 
SOCs of Infections and infestations, Cardiac disorders, and Neoplasms benign, malignant and 
unspecified (0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively), which were reported similarly in the placebo group 
(0.3% in each SOC). By PT, all SAEs were reported in <0.1% of participants in either group. 
From vaccination through the data cut-off date of 14 July 2022, SAEs were reported in 2.3% of 
participants in each group. The most frequently reported SOCs in the RSVpreF group were Cardiac 
disorders and Infections and infestations (0.5% each), which were reported similarly in the placebo 
group (0.5% and 0.4%, respectively). By PT, all SAEs were reported in <0.1% of participants in either 
group. The most frequently reported SAEs by PT in the RSVpreF group were Coronary artery disease, 
Acute myocardial infarction, Atrial fibrillation, and Ischaemic stroke (11 participants each), which were 
reported similarly in the placebo group.  
Three participants in the RSVpreF group and none in the placebo group had SAEs (GBS, Miller Fisher 
syndrome, and Hypersensitivity) assessed as related by the investigator.  
The case of hypersensitivity (allergic reaction; moderate severity) had onset on the day of vaccination 
and it resolved after 5 days. 
The case of GBS (life-threatening) had onset 7 days after vaccination and it was resolving as of the 
data cut-off date (177 days after vaccination).  
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 126/151 
 
 
 
 
The case of Miller Fisher syndrome had onset 8 days after vaccination and it resolved after 92 days. 
For age subgroups, in the RSVpreF group the proportions reporting SAEs were higher for those ≥80 
years (1.3%) than 60-69 years (0.5%) and 70-79 years (0.7%), whereas in the placebo group SAE 
reporting was similar by age subgroup (range: 0.4% - 0.6%). No SAEs were assessed as related in 
those aged ≥80 years in either group. 
Pregnant individuals 
Among maternal participants who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions 
reporting any SAEs from vaccination through the data cut-off date were similar in the pooled RSVpreF 
(15.8%) and placebo (15.1%) groups. SAEs that were most frequently reported for the pooled 
RSVpreF and placebo groups were in the SOC of Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
(11.6% vs. 11.1%). By PT, the most frequently reported AEs for the pooled RSVpreF and placebo 
groups were pre-eclampsia (1.8% vs. 1.5%), fetal distress syndrome (1.7% vs. 1.6%), arrested labour 
(1.0% vs. 1.2%), gestational hypertension (1.0% vs. 1.0%), and premature delivery (0.7% vs. 0.6%). 
As of the data cut-off date, there was 1 death of a maternal participant in the RSVpreF group in the 
Philippines due to postpartum haemorrhage and hypovolaemic shock, which was reported from 
delivery to 1 month after delivery. The death was assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
intervention.  
There was 1 additional death of a 48 year old non-pregnant female participant in the pooled safety 
database who received RSVpreF 120 μg in C3671001. The cause of death was toxicity to various 
agents (combined toxic effects of quetiapine and amlodipine use) and was considered not related to 
study intervention. 
Infants born to vaccinated mothers 
Among infants born to mothers who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, the proportions 
with SAEs through the data cut-off date were similar in the pooled RSVpreF (19.5%) and placebo 
(18.0%) groups. SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (4.4% vs. 4.2%), Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions (3.7% vs. 
3.5%) and Infections and infestations (3.1% versus 2.5%). Congenital, familial and genetic disorders 
were reported at a similar frequency in the pooled RSVpreF group (6.2%) and in the placebo group 
(5.7%). By PT, the most frequently reported SAEs were jaundice (1.9% vs. 1.8%), premature baby 
(1.4% vs. 1.2%), respiratory distress (1.2% vs. 1.2%) and hyperbilirubinaemia (1.2% vs. 1.1%). 
AEs leading to death were reported in 5 (0.1%) infants born to mothers who received RSVpreF any 
dose level/formulation and 12 (0.3%) infants whose mothers received placebo. None of these deaths 
was assessed as related to study intervention. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were not performed systematically in the Phase 3 trial. Any clinical 
laboratory values of concern that came to the attention of the investigator were to be reported as AEs.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Study C3671008 
In Study C3671008, AESIs for infant participants included low birth weight baby, premature baby, 
developmental delay, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (PCR or antigen-based); these AESIs were 
collected throughout the study. The AESI of low birth weight baby was reported for infant participants 
at a similar frequency for the RSVpreF and placebo groups (5.1% [95% CI: 4.4, 5.8] versus 4.3% 
[95% CI: 3.7, 5.0], respectively). Premature baby was also reported at a similar frequency for the 
RSVpreF and placebo groups (5.7% [95% CI: 4.9, 6.5] versus 4.7% [95% CI: 4.1, 5.5], respectively). 
The AESI of developmental delay was reported at a similar frequency in the RSVpreF and placebo 
groups (0.3%). 
Study C3671003 
In Study C3671003, AESI for infant participants included congenital anomalies and developmental 
delay. There were no AESI of developmental delay reported throughout the study. Most AESI of 
congenital anomalies were mild and those of at least moderate severity were reported in a similar 
frequency across all groups. None of these events were considered related to maternal vaccination with 
investigational product. 
Other Observations Related to Safety – Birth Outcomes 
Among infant participants born to mothers who received any dose level/formulation of RSVpreF, most 
infants in the pooled RSVpreF and placebo groups were born at term (≥37 weeks to <42 weeks). No 
meaningful differences were detected between the RSVpreF and placebo groups with respect to GA at 
birth, Apgar scores, or birthweight. 
Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity is reported as an immune system disorder in the older population with a frequency of 
<1/10,000. It is not described or listed to have occurred in the pregnant population.  Narratives are 
provided for the cases of hypersensitivity, Guillain-Barré and Miller Fisher syndrome. In the case of 
MFS, the investigator attributed causality to the vaccine due to the clinical presentation and the 
temporal relationship to administration of the vaccine. The Company did not agree with this 
assessment stating that the participant’s underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus could have been 
responsible for the clinical presentation. However, given her presentation of ataxia, diplopia and loss of 
consciousness and as there is no data presented indicating abnormal glucose control, the causality 
assessment of the independent investigator is understood. 
Hypersensitivity reaction 
The participant experienced a hypersensitivity reaction approximately 8 hours after receiving the study 
intervention. She had a medical history of penicillin and vitamin B12 allergy. On 30 Nov 2021 (Day 1), 
approximately 8 hours after receiving study treatment, she experienced acute shortness of breath and 
chest pain, which resulted in syncope with loss of consciousness and bladder relaxation. She was 
transferred to a primary care centre and given oxygen supplementation and dexamethasone 8 mg 
intravenously. When stable, she was transferred to a hospital where examination, ECG and CT of 
thorax, cervical spine and brain were normal. On 01 Dec 2021 (Day 2), laboratory results showed 
normal levels of troponin, serum creatine phosphokinase-MB, and D-dimer. On 04 Dec 2021 (Day 5), 
she was discharged with a diagnosis of allergic drug reaction.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome 
A 66-year-old, white, non-Hispanic/non-Latino male, received study intervention on 11 Jan 2022 (Day 
1) and had onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) on 18 Jan 2022. On 17 Jan 2022 (Day 7), he was 
hospitalised for non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction and had immediate angioplasty. He was treated 
with ticagrelor and started on ubidecarenone and Curcuma longa rhizome as supplementation therapy. 
On 18 Jan 2022 (Day 8), the event of myocardial infarction resolved and he was discharged on aspirin. 
He had lower back pain and bilateral lower extremity (BLE) weakness on 24 Jan 2022 (Day 14). On 16 
Feb 2022 (Day 37), he had a fall because of difficulty in walking and was hospitalised for lower 
extremity weakness and ataxia. He was discharged on 19 Feb 2022 (Day 40) with a walker but on 24 
Feb 2022 (Day 45), he was unable to walk and was re-hospitalised for worsening of lower extremity 
weakness and ataxia. After neurological exam, LP and nerve conduction study he was diagnosed with 
GBS, with an onset date of 18 Jan 2022 (Day 8). He received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. 
On 24 May 2022 (Day 134), he attended clinic in a wheelchair. He was noted to have gradually 
improved skin sensation and the ability to lift his legs and kick, but he was still unable to stand on his 
own. On 14 Jul 2022 (Day 185), he was able to walk with 2 canes. The event of GBS was resolving at 
the time of the last available report. 
Miller Fisher syndrome 
A 66-year-old, Asian, non-Hispanic/non-Latino female, received study intervention on 28 Oct 2021 
(Day 1). On 07 Nov 2021 (Day 11), she had ataxic gait, which resolved on the same day. On 15 Nov 
2021 (Day 19), she was brought to a hospital with severe fatigue and unstable movements and she 
developed diplopia and difficulty with her gait.  
On 18 Nov 2021 (Day 22), she was admitted to a second hospital with paraesthesia in both her palms 
and in the soles of her feet, diplopia and ataxic gait. On 19 Nov 2021 (Day 23), she was confirmed by 
an ophthalmologist to have ophthalmoplegia, eyelid ptosis, oculomotor nerve paralysis and abducens 
nerve paralysis, with a possibility of myasthenia gravis or Graves' eye disease. On 29 Nov 2021 (Day 
33), myasthenia gravis or Graves' eye disease was ruled out. On 06 Dec 2021 (Day 40), the diplopia 
was resolved and her gait, speech and consciousness had improved, except for the paraesthesia in the 
soles of her feet. On 07 Dec 2021 (Day 41), based on the information and clinical course, the 
neurologist made a retrospective diagnosis of MFS or Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). On 24 Dec 2021 
(Day 58), she was discharged from the hospital with paraesthesia persisting in the soles of her feet. 
On 04 Feb 2022 (Day 100), the participant’s paraesthesia in the soles of her feet also resolved. The 
participant was ongoing in the study, with the last reported visit on 21 Apr 2022 (Day 176). 
In the opinion of the investigator, there was a reasonable possibility that the MFS was related to the 
study intervention but not related to concomitant medications or clinical trial procedures. The 
investigator came to this conclusion as the participant’s symptom of malaise started on Day 9 and 
developed into double vision on Day 21, which had a time course typical for vaccine-related GBS. Also, 
since she did not have any background of immune-related disease, the investigator assessed a positive 
causality between the study intervention and MFS. Per Pfizer’s assessment, there was not enough 
evidence to attribute a causal association between MFS and the study intervention, and the underlying 
medical conditions of the participant could not be ruled out. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In a co-administration study (C3671001) in healthy male and non-pregnant female participants 18-85 
years of age, RSVpreF was safe and well-tolerated when administered alone or with SIIV, with no 
Assessment report

major differences observed across all dose levels and formulations. Likewise, in a co-administration 
study (C3671004) in healthy non-pregnant women 18-49 years of age, both formulations of RSVpreF 
were safe and well tolerated when administered alone or with Tdap. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Older Adult Population 
AEs leading to withdrawal from the study through the data cut-off date were similar in the RSVpreF 
and placebo groups: 10 (<0.1%) and 6 (<0.1%) participants, respectively. By PT, for both groups all 
events were reported in 1 participant each except for Depression (3 participants in the RSVpreF 
group). None of the events was assessed as related. 
Pregnant population 
As of the data cut-off date, 1 maternal participant in the placebo group withdrew from the study due to 
the AE of premature delivery. 
Infant Participants 
As of the data cut-off date, 1 infant participant whose mother received placebo was discontinued from 
the study due to severe AEs of atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and lung disorder; and 
life-threatening events of hypoxia and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. None of the AEs was 
assessed as related to study intervention. 
Post marketing experience 
There are no post marketing data available. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The pooled safety database consists of 17,215 treated older participants of which 6-month follow-up is 
available for approximately 77%. Local reaction and systemic event data were collected for 7 days 
after study vaccination in a subset of 7,160 participants. For all participants, adverse events were 
collected for 1 month after study vaccination and serious adverse events were collected throughout 
study participation.  
In the pregnant population the pooled safety analysis is based on 4,144 maternal exposures, 3797 at 
the therapeutic dose, and 88% had completed 6 months follow-up at the time of data cut-off.   
The most common adverse reactions reported within the first 30 days included injection site reaction, 
redness and swelling. Whilst the local reactions experienced by both groups was similar, a higher 
percentage of pregnant woman experienced local reactions.  
The incidence of systemic reactions was also higher in the pregnant population. The most frequently 
reported systemic event in both groups was fatigue which occurred with a similar frequency in both 
treated and placebo groups. The incidence of fever was low and occurred at a similar frequency in both 
the placebo group and vaccinated participants. The applicant was asked to provide details concerning 
prophylactic antipyretics administered to determine whether administration may have affected the 
incidence of pyrexia in either group. In response to the list of questions the applicant provided details 
of analgesic/anti-pyrectic use in the maternal population which was slightly greater than use in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023

placebo group as women who received the vaccine experienced more myalgia. Muscle pain and 
headache were more frequently reported in the RSVpreF group compared to placebo in the maternal 
population and are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The SmPC lists hypersensitivity reactions as occurring with a frequency of very rare in the older 
population. Further detail about the case of hypersensitivity reaction is provided in the participants’ 
narratives. Guillain-Barré syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome occurred in two participants in the 
older population. It is not clear how these adverse reactions are listed in the SmPC, it is not clear 
whether they have been included in the immune system disorders/hypersensitivity disorders whereas 
these reactions would by convention be considered nervous system disorders. The applicant has been 
asked to update section 4.8 with these adverse reactions. 
The rationale for the frequency and content of the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
was not clear. Further justification was requested form the applicant in particular for not including 
adverse reactions listed as occurring at a greater frequency in participants who received the vaccine. 
For example, in the older population the frequency of musculoskeletal disorders is higher (25 %) in 
subjects who received the vaccine than those who received placebo (15%), whilst myalgia is listed as 
an adverse reaction in the maternal population it is not listed as an adverse reaction in the older 
population. The applicant in response to the list of questions provided the rationale for inclusion of 
adverse reactions in the Table of ADRs in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. The risk ratio for myalgia in the 
older population was not significantly different to that for the older population who received placebo 
and therefore it was not listed in section 4.8. 
Further discussion was also needed with regard to premature labour, systemic lupus erythematosus 
and eclampsia, as there were noted as related SAEs. The applicant provided in their response 
narratives and justification for not considering these events as related and therefore not listing them in 
the product information.  
Most adverse reactions and events were of mild to moderate intensity.  
The safety profile was similar in participants who received any dose level or formulation of RSVpreF.  
The frequency of some adverse events was higher in pregnant women and this is reflected in the 
SmPC. 
The safety of the fetus of a maternal participant were reported for the maternal participant. The risk of 
fetal death (0.2%) was consistent or lower than the estimated background rates. Congenital 
abnormalities were reported at a similar frequency in the active and placebo treated groups. 
Developmental delays were reported at a similar frequency across both groups. 
The risk of preterm delivery was similar in the RSVpreF and placebo groups. However, there was a 
slightly higher number of preterm births reported in the vaccinated group in mothers from the upper 
middle-income group. The number of preterm infants involved is small. Overall the difference in 
preterm birth in mothers in the vaccinated and placebo groups was not statistically significant.  
The number of extremely preterm infants remains low at 1 in both vaccinated and placebo groups. The 
number of extremely and very low birth weight infants was slightly greater in the placebo group and 
the total number of low-birth weight infants comparable in both groups.

In study C3671008, AESIs for infant participants included low birth weight baby, premature baby, 
developmental delay and a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (PCR or antigen-based); these AESIs were 
collected throughout the study. The AESI of low-birth weight baby was reported for infant participants 
with a slightly higher frequency for the RSVpreF vs placebo groups (5.1% versus 4.3%). Premature 
baby was also reported at a slightly higher frequency for the RSVpreF and placebo groups (5.7% 
versus 4.7 %). The AESI of developmental delay was reported in two infants in each group (<0.1%).  
For both AESIs low birth weight as well as premature baby the applicant was asked to provide further 
information on severity (e.g. proportions of diverging weight and age at birth).  
The applicant provided the requested data and clarified that the higher numbers in the RSV group vs 
the placebo group mainly come from imbalances observed in upper-middle income countries (7.5% vs 
4.1%). As numbers in high and low-income countries were comparable, there was no increase in 
mortality in preterm births and the overall incidence of preterm births was lower than the background 
rates in all countries where the study was conducted, no further concerns are raised. 
Over ninety three percent of pregnancies resulted in a full-term infant. Seventy percent of deliveries 
were vaginal which is in keeping with expected vaginal delivery rates. Low birth weight was reported at 
a similar frequency for infant participants. There is data on average birthweights, low Apgar score at 
birth and rate of admission to NICU provided by the applicant with no increase in incidence in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers.  
However, the number of preterm deliveries and low birth weight should continue to be monitored in 
the planned post authorisation studies. Data including potential risk factors for preterm delivery should 
be collected in the studies.  
The number of infant deaths to 24 months was higher in the placebo group. 
In study 003 (phase 2 b) there were higher numbers of congenital anomalies of at least moderate 
severity in 9.6% (RSV) compared to the 6% placebo group. Except 3 cases of ankyloglossia congenital 
in RSV group vs 1 in placebo, all other AE of congenital anomalies were single cases. None of these 
events were considered related to maternal vaccination with investigational product. The applicant was 
asked to provide summary tables for all cases of congenital anomalies based on severity, as well as 
expected background incidence of the respective anomalies. The applicant provided the requested data 
in their responses.  For all cases of congenital anomalies, a summary table based on severity was 
provided. There was no obvious difference in rates of SAEs of congenital anomalies between the 
RSVpreF and the placebo group.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP is of the opinion that RSVpreF was well tolerated in the older population and in 
pregnant women and infants. Adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials in the older and pregnant 
populations are reflected in the proposed SmPC. There are no major safety objections.

The PhV plan includes 3 category 3 PASSs as follows:  
1.  Study C3671031 entitled Post-marketing safety study of respiratory syncytial virus bivalent 
stabilised prefusion F vaccine (RSVpreF) among older adults in the United States 
The applicant proposes to further evaluate whether RSVpreF is associated with an increased 
risk of GBS and other immune-mediated demyelinating conditions among older adults in the US 
in a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study among US Medicare beneficiaries. Two study 
designs commonly used in vaccine safety studies will be used: 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 134/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  First, an internal comparator design aims to estimate the incidence of GBS, and other 
immune-mediated demyelinating conditions, during a pre-defined risk window (e.g., 1-42 
days post vaccination, recommended by Brighton collaborationi) among Medicare 
beneficiaries who receive RSVpreF versus those who are not vaccinated with RSVpreF at 
that point in time.  
o  Secondly, a self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) analysis may also be conducted among 
RSVpreF vaccinated Medicare beneficiaries to compare the incidence of GBS, and other 
immune-mediated demyelinating conditions, during the post-vaccination risk window (e.g., 
1-42 days following vaccination) to the post-vaccination control window (e.g., 43-84 days 
following vaccination).  
As data source the study will use the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
Medicare administrative database capturing all paid claims for fee-for-service (FFS) billable 
healthcare services in inpatient and outpatient settings as well as Part D claims for prescription 
drugs/vaccines. Medicare data have been used by federal health agencies to successfully 
monitor and evaluate the risk of GBS following vaccinations for influenza and Shingrix. 
Besides primary outcome GBS, other immune-mediated demyelinating conditions will be 
evaluated as secondary endpoints, including encephalitis/encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, 
optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and other acute demyelinating diseases. 
Regarding the sample size, assuming a background rate of 4.6 GBS events per 100,000 person 
years, the applicant calculated that approximately 1.3-1.5 million individuals vaccinated with 
RSVpreF will be needed to detect a ≥ 3-fold increased risk of GBS during a 42-day risk period 
with 80% power and a two-sided alpha error rate of 0.05. Although the sample size calculation 
seems valid, whether the targeted enrollment of 1.3-1.5 million vaccines would be 
realistic/feasible (or not), is uncertain at this moment, pending the vaccine uptake. 
2.  C3671026, entitled “Safety of respiratory syncytial virus stabilized prefusion F subunit vaccine 
(RSVpreF) in pregnant women in a real world setting in Europe” has been revised to include all 
eligible pregnant women, including immunocompetent and immunocompromised women, and 
high-risk pregnancies. This study will complement routine pharmacovigilance activities and will 
allow timely identification of any emerging trends. Outcomes of interest include stillbirth, 
preterm birth, small for gestational age, low birth weight, maternal and neonatal death, and 
other safety events, including Guillain-Barré syndrome if warranted. Upon agency’s request 
more detail has been provided regarding feasibility, data sources (eHR databases in DK; NO; 
ES; FR; IT; NL; and UK), outcomes of interest, estimates of maternal vaccination coverage, 
and timelines. These amendments are accepted by the Committee.  
3.  Study C3671038 (Category 3 PASS) entitled “Safety of respiratory syncytial virus stabilised 
prefusion F subunit vaccine (RSVpreF) in immunocompromised, and renally or hepatically 
impaired older adults aged 60 years and older in a real world setting in Europe”. 
In response to the Committee’s request for inclusion of persons with renal and hepatic 
impairment, the applicant proposes a separate planned Observational Study C3671038 and has 
provided some more detail. Outcomes of interest will include neurological, immunological, 
cardiac, haematological, and other events (e.g., death). The applicant noted that the proposed 
list of outcomes may still be amended, as collaborative work is underway in the BeCOME 
(Beyond COVID Monitoring Excellence) collaboration of vaccine manufacturers, to generate a 
standardised list of events of interest for monitoring RSV vaccines. The applicant also discussed 
feasibility, data sources (eHR databases in UK; FR; DE; NL; IT; ES; DK), and prevalence 
estimates of older adults who are immunocompromised, or renally or hepatically impaired, and

timelines. The applicant agreed that in study C3671038 (Category 3 PASS) Guillain-Barré 
Syndrome is included in the list of outcomes of interest. 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan could be sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the 
product. 
The applicant has agreed to include Guillain-Barré Syndrome in the list of outcomes of interest in study 
C3671038 (Category 3 PASS). 
The applicant’s commitments are noted to submit the full protocols for study C3671031 by 30 
November 2023, and studies C3671026 and C3671038 by 31 May 2024. 
The CHMP also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

Summary of additional risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation activities as described in Section V.1 are sufficient to manage the safety 
concerns of the medicinal product. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The CHMP having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that: 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indications. 
2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic safety update reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions  
None requested. 
2.9.3.  Quick response (QR) code 
Not applicable.

2.9.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Abrysvo (respiratory syncytial virus 
vaccines) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance, which on 1 
January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The applicant has developed a vaccine to protect against disease caused by the respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV) and sought two indications for use, with revised wording as follows: 
• 
Passive protection against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) in infants from birth through 6 months of age following maternal immunisation during 
pregnancy. See sections 4.2 and 5.1. 
• 
Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
RSV is a negative sense, single stranded RNA orthopneumovirus that causes infections of the human 
respiratory tract. RSV has two subgroups – RSV A and RSV B. The RSV F of A and B subgroups is 
~90% identical and it is the primary target of neutralising antibodies that also show some degree of 
cross-neutralisation. Most of the sequence differences between the mature F glycoproteins of the 
subgroups are concentrated in the prefusion-specific epitopes that elicit the majority of RSV-
neutralising and protective antibody responses. 
RSV cases follow a seasonal pattern in many countries that is in line with that of influenza, causing 
illness primarily in the cooler months of the year in temperate regions and during the wet season in 
tropical countries with seasonal rainfall. RSV can affect any age group and almost all children have 
serological evidence of exposure to the virus by the age of 2 years. 
RSV disease in adults 
In Europe, RSV infection can also be serious for adults aged 50 years and older as it can cause acute 
respiratory infection, influenza-like illness or community-acquired pneumonia. Annual RSV attack rates 
of 4.2% and 7.2% were observed in community-living adults aged ≥60 years in successive seasons. In 
UK adults aged from 18 years, some authors have estimated of 487,247 outpatient episodes, 17,799 
hospitalisations and 8,482 attributable deaths per season. Of these, 36% of GP episodes, 79% of 
hospitalisations and 93% of deaths were in ≥65-year-olds. 
RSV infection has been associated with up to 22% of acute COPD exacerbations in prospective cohort 
studies and 11% of wintertime hospitalisations for COPD exacerbations. In industrialised countries, the 
case fatality rate of RSV-ARI was 11.7% for adults with comorbidity but 1.6% for the general 
population. There are some recognised risk factors for severe RSV disease in older adults, including the 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 138/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elderly. Immunosenescence can result in a weakened immune response to pathogens and suboptimal 
response to vaccines. In addition, there may be reduced lung expansion in older adults because of 
decreased strength of the respiratory muscles and the diaphragm. Older adults may also have 
decreased protective mucus levels, lung compliance and elastin. 
RSV disease in infants 
RSV is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children. It may cause bronchiolitis 
and pneumonia and can lead to fatal respiratory distress. Globally, there are an estimated 33 million 
episodes of RSV-associated ALRI each year in children aged <5 years resulting in an estimated 3.6 
million hospitalisations. Among children <6 months there are an estimated 6.6 million RSV-associated 
ALRI episodes and 1.4 million hospitalisations.  
RSV is a leading cause of paediatric hospitalisation in Europe. In a recent study of the aetiology of 
severe ARI requiring hospitalisation conducted in 7 countries, RSV was identified as the most common 
cause of ARI hospitalisations in young children, causing one third of ARI admissions. In a separate 
European study, rates of RSV hospitalisation varied by country from 8.6 to 22.3 per 1,000 children <1 
year of age but patterns across age were remarkably similar. In all countries, RSV-associated 
hospitalisation rates were significantly higher in children <1 year of age compared to those 1-4 years 
of age and decreased with increasing age. RSV admissions peaked among infants <1 month. 
While virtually all children experience RSV in the first 2 years of life, rates of RSV hospitalisation in 
infancy are greater among those with medical (e.g. prematurity, low levels of maternal neutralising 
antibodies) and socioeconomic risk factors.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Palivizumab is authorised for immunoprophylaxis, given as monthly injections during RSV seasons. In 
Europe, it is commonly used in infants aged <6 months who were born before 35 weeks of gestation 
and children aged <2 years of age who have been treated for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the 
last 6 months or have a serious heart condition. The effectiveness of palivizumab highlighted the 
importance of neutralising antibodies in protection against RSV disease. Subsequently, nirsevimab was 
developed as a single dose, extended half-life prefusion F-specific mAb. It demonstrated efficacy 
against RSV LRTI in Phase 3 studies and was given EU marketing authorisation in October 2022.  
On 06 June 2023, a marketing authorisation in the European Union was granted for Arexvy 
(recombinant, adjuvanted), for active immunisation to protect adults aged 60 years and older against 
LRTD caused by RSV.  
There are no specific therapeutics indicated for treatment of RSV. Treatment of RSV disease consists 
primarily of supportive care (e.g. oxygen, hydration and suctioning of secretions). The use of 
aerosolised ribavirin is usually limited to immunosuppressed persons due to inconvenient 
administration, questionable benefit, teratogenicity concerns and high cost. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant conducted a human challenge study WI257521 in healthy adults aged 18-50 years with a 
primary readout based on qRT-PCR-confirmed symptomatic RSV infections using several definitions. 
C3671013 was the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study in older adults aged from 60 years. This study was 
double-blind and placebo-controlled. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 139/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Having selected a dose for pregnant women from a Phase 2b dose-finding study C3671003, in which 
efficacy in infants was exploratory, the applicant conducted a single pivotal Phase 3 study C3671008 to 
evaluate the efficacy of RSVpreF vaccine in infants born to women vaccinated during pregnancy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy in adults aged from 60 years 
C3671013 was the single pivotal vaccine efficacy study to support use in subjects aged from 60 years. 
This randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to estimate the absolute vaccine 
efficacy of RSVpreF using a case-driven primary analysis based on RSV-LRTI meeting the primary case 
definitions that required ≥2 or ≥3 of the listed symptoms to be present.  
The study sites covered North and South America, two EU countries, South Africa and Japan. There 
was stratification at site-based randomisation with an aim to recruit at least 6,000 in each of the sub-
groups 60-69 and 70-79 years and at least 800 aged 80+ years. There was also an aim to recruit at 
least 10% with stable chronic cardiopulmonary conditions but those with unstable conditions or known 
to be immunosuppressed were excluded. The protocol pre-defined acceptable clinical definitions for 
RSV-LRTI, severe RSV LRTI (RSV-sLRTI) and acute respiratory infection (RSV-ARI); all required RT-
PCR confirmation. Cases were to be reported and counted starting from day 14 after vaccination and 
primary analyses were to be conducted in the efficacy evaluable population with additional analyses in 
all-treated (mITT) subjects. Generally, the approach taken was acceptable. 
There was a plan for sequential testing of hypotheses such that if the lower bound of the adjusted CI 
around the point estimate of vaccine efficacy was >20% for RSV-LRTI with ≥2 symptoms, then 
efficacy was to be estimated for RSV-LRTI with ≥3 symptoms. If the lower bound of the adjusted CI 
around the point estimate of vaccine efficacy for RSV-LRTI with ≥3 symptoms was >20%, efficacy was 
to be calculated for severe RSV-LRTI, which was designated as a key secondary endpoint and had the 
same criterion for concluding on efficacy. Vaccine efficacy against RSV ARI was a planned secondary 
analysis but this endpoint was not included in the confirmatory testing strategy.    
The sample size calculation was based on conducting the primary analysis when at least 59 cases of 
RSV-LRTI with ≥2 symptoms had accrued in the efficacy evaluable population. However, there was a 
planned interim analysis when at least 29 evaluable first-episode RSV-LRTI cases with ≥2 symptoms 
had accrued. Moreover, the interim analysis was to estimate efficacy against RSV-LRTI with ≥3 
symptoms if at least 15 cases had accrued and against RSV-sLRTI if 12 cases had accrued. There was 
no minimum set for including an analysis of RSV-ARI in the interim or final analyses. 
By mid-July 2022, more than 34,000 subjects had been randomised and treated and 94% were still 
being followed in the study. The majority (>22,000; ~60%) was enrolled in N. America, followed by 
~8000 (~21%) in Argentina. While the majority was aged 60-69 years (~21,000), ~11,000 were aged 
70-79 years and >900 subjects (~6%) were 80+ years. Just over half had at least one of the pre-
specified significant underlying conditions. Ultimately, 95% of randomised subjects in each group were 
eligible for the evaluable efficacy population.    
The planned interim efficacy analysis was conducted when 44 first-episode RSV LRTIs with ≥2 
symptoms had accrued in the first RSV season and up to a cut-off date of 08 July 2022. At this time, 
the mean surveillance duration was 206 days in both treatment groups. Vaccine efficacy against RSV-
LRTI was 66.7% with a lower bound of the 96.66% CI >28%. The benefit of RSVpreF was apparent 
Assessment report

Page 140/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very shortly after commencement of active surveillance and, based on available follow-up data, was 
maintained at one year. 
The majority of cases was due to RSV B and the study was not powered for efficacy analyses by 
subtype. Nevertheless, using the standard method of calculating vaccine efficacy, the point estimates 
and 96.66% CI were 88.9 (10.6, 99.8) for RSV A and 56.5 (-0.7, 82.8) for RSV B. These data, along 
with the clear numerical difference favouring RSVpreF for RSV A and RSV B cases, do not point to any 
specific concern about efficacy by RSV subtype.  
There were 16 first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥3 symptoms using the same cut-off date so the 
interim analysis of that endpoint was also conducted. With only 2/16 cases in the RSVpreF group, 
vaccine efficacy was 85.7% and the lower bound of the 96.66% CI was 32%. Of the 16 cases, 11 were 
due to RSV B, with vaccine efficacy at 90% (96.66% CI 21.8, 99.8). For RSV A, it can only be 
observed that 3 of the 4 cases occurred in the placebo group. The benefit of vaccination for this 
endpoint was apparent from ~day 45 post-vaccination onwards and was maintained at one year using 
all available follow-up data. 
Overall, the interim analysis demonstrated that RSVpreF is efficacious in preventing RSV-LRTI in adults 
aged from 60 years from day 15 post-vaccination onwards. The EOS1 analysis was provided during the 
procedure and gave results for estimates of VE based on updated numbers of cases that were 
consistent with those of the interim analysis. 
Efficacy in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
C3671008 was the single pivotal efficacy study to support use in pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of 
gestation to prevent RSV-LRTI in their infants during the first 6 months of life. This randomised, double 
blind, placebo-controlled study was designed to estimate the absolute vaccine efficacy of RSVpreF 
against RSV LRTI in infants born to vaccinated mothers using a case-driven primary analysis.  
Eligible women were to be between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation based on LMP and the earliest 
ultrasound conducted with an uncomplicated and natural singleton pregnancy. For purposes of 
providing a population expected to be adherent to study procedures, these women were to be 
attending antenatal care with planned delivery in a healthcare facility. The protocol defined the infant 
efficacy endpoints in detail, which were acceptable. It should be noted that these endpoints all involved 
medically-attended illnesses, defined by any contact with a healthcare professional. However, the 
proposed indication statement refers only to the disease to be prevented, which is acceptable.  
Active surveillance commenced with weekly contacts from 72 h after birth and continued until month 
6, after which the frequency of contact was reduced to approximately monthly. Care-givers were also 
able to initiate contact with study staff in case of intervening onset of illnesses potentially meeting the 
criteria. 
There were parallel primary efficacy endpoints of MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI for which there was a 
Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment procedure. Success of the study required that the lower bound of 
the CI around the point estimates of vaccine efficacy for either or both endpoints were >20%. 
Furthermore, for each of these primary endpoints, there was sequential testing for vaccine efficacy 
based on cases of each that occurred up to day 90, day 120, day 150 and day 180 after birth. Based 
on several assumptions regarding accrual and 60% vaccine efficacy, 6,900 pregnant women were to 
be enrolled to provide 124 cases of RSV MA-LRTI in their infants with onset within 90 days of birth. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 141/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interim analyses were planned to assess efficacy and safety after at least 43 cases and/or after at 
least 62 cases of MA-LRTI due to RSV within 90 days of birth had accrued and results could be used for 
stopping for futility or stopping for early success. The exact number of cases at each interim analysis 
was not fixed and could be decided based on operational reasons. The alpha levels used at interim and 
final analyses depended on the exact fraction of cases available at the interim analysis.  
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the infant efficacy evaluation population, which was 
confined to those born at least 14 days after maternal vaccination and excluded any infants who 
received an anti-RSV monoclonal antibody. The main analysis was also performed based on the mITT 
efficacy infant population. This plan was acceptable. 
Where MA-LRTI and severe MA-LRTI visits had no accompanying valid central or local NAAT test 
results, positive or negative results were imputed. The plans for imputation included assuming that 
missing swab results were positive in the same proportion (by vaccine group) as the non-missing swab 
results in MA-LRTI events (missing-at-random assumption). Alternatively, missing swab results for 
vaccine group infants were assumed to be positive in higher proportions than the non-missing swab 
results in MA-LRTI events while missing swab results for placebo group infants were assumed to be 
positive in the same proportion as the non-missing swab results in MA-LRTI events (missing-not-at-
random assumption). In a further sensitivity analysis, any test indicating positivity for RSV was to be 
accepted and used to define MA-LRTI cases if qualified by clinical symptoms. Where events were 
adjudicated, the EAC’s decision on the event as MA-LRTI or severe MA-LRTI was used. If not 
adjudicated, the event was assessed according to the protocol criteria for each event.  
The results reported in the CSR of December 2022 reflect the second interim efficacy analysis, which 
was conducted following the predicted end of the fourth RSV season and included 80 evaluable cases 
of MA-LRTI due to RSV with onset within 90 days of birth, of which 39 were severe MA-LRTI. The 
results led the E-DMC to recommend stopping the study because the success criterion for VE was met 
for one of the two primary efficacy endpoints. At the time of data cut-off, >75% of the 7392 pregnant 
women had completed the study and almost 80% of their infants had completed at least to month 6.  
Just over half of the adolescent and adult pregnant females (aged from 14-47 years) had been 
vaccinated between weeks 24 and 32 and ~45% between weeks 32-36. Most infants were born at 
term (≥93.7% born at ≥37 weeks to <42 weeks) while most of the pre-term infants were near-term at 
birth (≥4.4% were ≥34 to <37 weeks GA). Less than 2% were excluded from the primary analysis 
because they were born less than 2 weeks after maternal vaccination. 
With 80 cases of RSV MA-LRTI with onset within 90 days of birth, the point estimate of vaccine efficacy 
was 57.1% with 99.5% CI 14.7, 79.8. Thus, the pre-defined lower bound criterion for success (>20%) 
was not met even though it was well above zero, which is compatible with a conclusion of superiority 
for maternal vaccination vs. no vaccination. Although it was understood from the protocol that testing 
at sequential time points would not occur if the pre-defined criterion for success was not met at the 
prior time point, the CSR shows sequential analyses. The point estimates of vaccine efficacy remained 
>50% at days 120, 150 and 180, although there was a small decline to 51.3% at day 180, and the 
lower bounds of the 97.5% CI were from 28-31%. The graphical display showed separation of the 
curves from ~2 weeks after birth onwards. Results for the mITT population and planned sensitivity 
analyses gave similar findings.   
Vaccine efficacy against severe RSV MA-LRTI was 81.8% at day 90, falling to 69.4% at day 180 but 
the lower bounds of the CI were >40% at each time point. Thus, the vaccine was more effective at

preventing severe disease in vaccine breakthrough cases of RSV-LRTI than it was at preventing RSV-
LRTI. Graphical display indicated separation of the curves from 2 weeks after birth onwards. Results 
were similar for the mITT population and for the planned sensitivity analyses.   
The overall findings suggest that administration of RSVpreF during pregnancy is superior to no 
RSVpreF during pregnancy for preventing RSV MA-LRTI in the first 6 months of life.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
RSV A and RSV B 
At the time that the pivotal efficacy studies were conducted, RSV B predominated over RSV A in 
causing symptomatic disease in older adults and in infants. It was acceptable that neither C3671013 in 
older adults nor C3671008 in infants born to vaccinated mothers was powered to determine efficacy 
against the individual RSV subtypes. Indeed, since the subtype distributions could not be predicted 
prior to study initiation, it would not have been feasible to power the studies for subtype efficacy.  
The available data show at least a numerical benefit for RSVpreF vs. placebo for preventing RSV-LRTI 
due to RSV A and B in both populations of interest. However, with few RSV A cases, the 95% CI for 
point estimates of vaccine efficacy for these secondary endpoints were wide, such that lower bounds 
were not always above zero. It should be noted that the RSV subgroup was not determined for all 
cases that met the clinical criteria and were laboratory-confirmed. It cannot be ruled out that some 
bias could have occurred in reporting of subtypes depending on the assay performance (e.g. if 
subtyping required a minimum amount of virus to be present and viral load was more likely to be 
higher in older adults given placebo and in infants born to mothers given placebo). While the pivotal 
studies cannot confirm comparable efficacy against RSV A and B, the immunogenicity data in older 
adults and in infants indicate broadly comparable NA50 titres against the two subtypes. Overall, there is 
no specific concern raised over the ability of RSVpreF to prevent RSV-LRTI due to RSV A or B.  
Efficacy in older adults 
The number of cases of severe RSV-LRTI accrued as of the cut-off date was <12 so no analysis was 
conducted and no claim for prevention of severe cases is made by the applicant. There were 
insufficient additional cases of severe LRTI at EOS1 to support a robust estimate of VE specific to 
severe LRTI.    
Having reached the success criteria for the analyses of RSV-LRTI, the applicant analysed the secondary 
endpoint of RSV ARI. With 22 RSVpreF vs. 58 placebo group cases, the point estimate of vaccine 
efficacy was 62% and the lower bound of the 95% CI was 37%, which supports a conclusion that 
RSVpreF also has an effect on preventing RSV ARI. However, this was a secondary analysis for which 
the study was not powered and for which there is no evidence that Type 1 error was controlled.  
Efficacy in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
The largest proportion of pregnant women was enrolled in the US, where 17 cases of RSV MA-LRTI 
accrued (2 RSV Pre F and 15 placebo) by day 90, giving a point estimate of vaccine efficacy at 86.8% 
(95% CI 43.4, 98.5). There were no cases recorded in several participating countries before day 90, 
possibly influenced by COVID-19 restrictions and parental caution. Whereas similar numbers were 
enrolled in Argentina and S. Africa, vaccine efficacy by day 90 was shown only in Argentina (65.5%; 
15.1, 87.7) and there was no apparent benefit in S. Africa (with 8 cases in the vaccine group and 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 143/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases in the placebo group). Moreover, the cases accrued up to day 90 indicated that vaccine efficacy 
was apparent only in the upper income countries.  
However, as time passed and cases accumulated, a numerical benefit for infants born to vaccinated 
mothers began to emerge in several countries with no or very few cases at earlier time points and case 
rates were lower vs. placebo group infants even in S. Africa. With even fewer cases of severe RSV MA-
LRTI recorded, even greater caution is required when viewing the subgroup analyses. However, a 
similar pattern emerged, with a numerical benefit evident even in S. Africa especially from D120 
onwards.   
The applicant does not claim a benefit for preventing any RSV disease. However, this was evaluated as 
an exploratory endpoint (i.e. counting any symptomatic laboratory-proven RSV cases regardless of 
LRTI) and gave estimates of vaccine efficacy up to day 180 in the range 37-39% with lower bounds of 
the 95% CIs all above 16 and above 20 from D120 onwards. It is agreed that no claim should be made 
based on this analysis but it is supportive of the primary analysis.  
The subgroup analyses must be viewed with caution due to small or very small denominators in many 
cases. There appeared to be at least a numerical benefit for RSVpreF for RSV MA-LRTI regardless of 
maternal vaccination between weeks 24-28, 28-32 or 32-36 weeks of gestation, which supports the 
recommendations for timing of maternal vaccination made in section 4.2. However, the data point to 
the possibility that efficacy may be lowest in infants born to mothers immunised in the 24-28 week 
window of gestation and these data have been described in section 5.1.  
Concomitant administrations 
In the FIH study, co-administration of 240 μg RSVpreF with seasonal influenza vaccines gave a general 
trend to lower HAI titres especially in the younger age subgroup, noting that the two age subgroups 
received different seasonal influenza vaccines. Additional data for HD seasonal influenza vaccine in 
subjects aged 65-85 years in a separate study suggested no major effect of RSVpreF co-administration 
on HAI titres in this age range.     
To further investigate co-administration with seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (SIIV), the 
applicant has conducted a Phase 3 study C3671006 in ~1400 healthy Australian adults aged 65+ years 
who received RSVpreF + SIIV together or in a staggered fashion. Data from this study indicate that NA 
GMTs for RSV A and B as well as HAI titres are numerically lower on co-administration although all the 
lower bounds of the 95% CI around the GMT ratios exceed 0.67. Therefore, co-administration is not 
precluded but a more extensive description is required in section 4.5. 
Co-administration with Tdap was investigated in non-pregnant women aged 18-49 years and indicated 
no negative effect on anti-RSV A and B NA based on the pre-defined non-inferiority criteria. For anti-T 
and anti-D, the majority of subjects already had >0.1 IU/mL prior to vaccination, which somewhat 
limits any conclusion based on results that showed that the pre-defined non-inferiority criteria were 
met. For proportions with >1.0 IU/mL anti-D, the comparison made between the selected RSVpreF 
formulation (120 μg) and the placebo group (Tdap alone) suggested a negative effect of co-
administration on anti-D (from 24% to 53% in the c-administration group vs. 17.9% to 77% in the 
Tdap alone group). 
Using the combined results from RSVpreF groups, non-inferiority was not shown for anti-PT, anti-FHA 
and anti-PRN immune responses since the lower bounds of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the GMC ratios of 
the combined RSVpreF/Tdap groups to the placebo/Tdap group did not exceed 0.67 (range 0.48 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 144/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.64). When the comparison was made between the 120 μg RSVpreF formulation and Tdap alone, the 
lower bounds of the CIs were 0.68 for anti-PT, 0.52 for anti-FHA and 0.45 for anti-PRN. In the Phase 3 
study C3671008 at least 2 weeks was to elapse between administration of RSVpreF and Tdap.   
Current evidence, and the stance taken in the Phase 3 study, should lead to a clear statement in 
section 4.5 that at least 2 weeks are recommended between administrations of RSVpreF and Tdap. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The size and extent of exposure of the safety population is sufficient and in line with ICH E1. 
The most common adverse reactions reported within the first 30 days included injection site reaction, 
redness and swelling. Whilst the local reactions experienced by both groups of adults were similar, a 
higher percentage of pregnant woman experienced local reactions.  
The incidence of systemic reactions was also higher in the pregnant population. The most frequently 
reported systemic event was fatigue which occurred with a similar frequency in both treated and 
placebo groups. The incidence of fever was low and occurred at a similar frequency in both the placebo 
group and vaccinated participants. However, a larger percentage of vaccinated subjects took 
analgesics for muscle pain which could have masked pyrexia.   
Muscle pain and headache were more frequently reported in the RSVpreF group compared to placebo 
in the maternal population and are listed in the SmPC.  
Guillain-Barré syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome occurred in two participants in the older 
population.  
The majority of adverse reactions and events were of mild to moderate intensity. The safety profile 
was similar in participants who received any dose level or formulation of RSVpreF. 
The risk of fetal death (0.2%) was consistent or lower than the estimated background rates. 
Congenital abnormalities were reported at a similar frequency in the active and placebo treated 
groups. Developmental delays were reported at a similar frequency across both groups. The risk of 
preterm delivery was similar in the RSVpreF and placebo groups, except in one group of women where 
there was a slightly higher number of preterm deliveries. These women were of upper middle-income 
status and the reason for a slightly higher number of preterm deliveries in this group is not clear.  
Premature delivery will be further monitored in the planned post authorisation studies. 
The condition at birth for live infants was comparable between those born to vaccinated and 
unvaccinated mothers.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The applicant has provided justification for the adverse reactions listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC but 
has been asked to include some adverse events of special interest (AESI). Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS) and Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) occurred in two participants in the older population.  
The applicant provided data concerning anti-pyretic use in vaccinated subjects and there was a slightly 
increased use of analgesics due to myalgia in the maternal population treated with the vaccine. Use of 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 145/151 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anti-pyrectic analgesics may mask pyrexia and the applicant has been requested to monitor adverse 
reactions including pyrexia in the post authorisation setting. 
For the AESIs low birth weight as well as premature baby further information on severity (e.g. 
proportions of diverging weight and age at birth) was requested. In addition, for all cases of congenital 
anomalies, summary tables based on severity as well as expected background incidence of the 
respective anomalies were requested. 
The applicant provided the requested data and clarified that the higher numbers in the RSV group vs 
the placebo group mainly come from imbalances observed in upper-middle income countries (7.5% vs 
4.1%). As numbers in high and low-income countries were comparable, there was no increase in 
mortality in preterm births and the overall incidence of preterm births was lower than the background 
rates in all countries where the study was conducted, no further concerns are raised. 
However, the number of preterm deliveries and low birth weight should continue to be monitored in 
the planned post authorisation studies. Data including potential risk factors for preterm delivery should 
be collected in the studies.  
For all cases of congenital anomalies, a summary table based on severity was provided. There was no 
difference in rates of SAEs of congenital anomalies between the RSVpreF and the placebo group.  
To provide more data about the safety profile of the vaccine, the applicant was requested to provide an 
update on all available safety data from studies C3671008 and C3671013 and an update documenting 
resolution of the serious adverse events. The applicant provided the requested data and information on 
resolution of all serious adverse events and reactions.  
The final study reports for both studies C3671008 and C3671013 are due in 2024 and this should be 
submitted to the agency by the company. 
Some populations were excluded from the clinical trials and therefore there is no safety data from 
individuals with high-risk pregnancies, renal or hepatic impairment or individuals with 
immunodeficiency. These high-risk populations have been added to the missing information in the 
safety specifications of the risk management plan.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy in adults aged from 60 years 
C3671013 was the single pivotal vaccine efficacy study to support use in subjects aged from 60 years. 
This randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study was adequately designed to estimate the 
absolute vaccine efficacy of RSVpreF using a case-driven primary analysis based on RSV-LRTI meeting 
the primary case definitions that required ≥2 or ≥3 of the listed symptoms to be present.  
The planned interim efficacy analysis was conducted when 44 first-episode RSV LRTIs with ≥2 
symptoms had accrued in the first RSV season, at which time vaccine efficacy was 66.7% with a lower 
bound of the 96.66% CI >28%. The benefit of RSVpreF was apparent very shortly after 
commencement of active surveillance and, based on available follow-up data, was maintained at one 
year. Based on 16 first-episode LRTI-RSV cases with ≥3 symptoms accrued by the same cut-off date, 
vaccine efficacy was 85.7% and the lower bound of the 96.66% CI was 32%. The benefit of 
vaccination for this endpoint was apparent from ~day 45 post-vaccination onwards and was 
maintained at one year using all available follow-up data. Overall, the interim analysis demonstrated 
that RSVpreF is efficacious in preventing RSV-LRTI in adults aged from 60 years from day 15 post-
vaccination onwards. Therefore, the primary analysis supports a claim for prevention of RSV LRTI in 
adults aged from 60 years.  
Safety in adults aged from 60 years 
The majority of adverse reactions and events were of mild to moderate intensity. The most common 
adverse reactions reported within the first 30 days included injection site reaction, redness and 
swelling. The most commonly reported systemic side effects included muscle pain and headache. The 
incidence of fever was low and occurred at a similar frequency in both the placebo group and 
vaccinated participants.  
Guillain-Barré syndrome and Miller Fisher syndrome occurred in two participants in the older 
population. The applicant has been requested to update section 4.8 of the SmPC with these adverse 
reactions.

Efficacy in infants born to vaccinated mothers 
C3671008 was the single pivotal efficacy study to support use in pregnant women at 24-36 weeks of 
gestation to prevent RSV-LRTI in their infants during the first 6 months of life. This randomised, double 
blind, placebo-controlled study was adequately designed to estimate the absolute vaccine efficacy of 
RSVpreF against RSV LRTI in infants born to vaccinated mothers using a case-driven primary analysis.  
The results reported in the CSR of December 2022 reflect the second interim efficacy analysis, which 
was conducted following the predicted end of the fourth RSV season and included 80 evaluable cases 
of MA-LRTI due to RSV with onset within 90 days of birth, of which 39 were severe MA-LRTI. For 
prevention of RSV MA-LRTI with onset within 90 days of birth, the point estimate of vaccine efficacy 
was 57.1% with 99.5% CI 14.7, 79.8. Thus, the pre-defined lower bound criterion for success (>20%) 
was not met even though it was well above zero, which is compatible with a conclusion of superiority 
for maternal vaccination vs. no vaccination. The point estimates of vaccine efficacy remained >50% at 
days 120, 150 and 180 and the lower bounds of the 97.5% CI were from 28-31%. The graphical 
display showed separation of the curves from ~2 weeks after birth onwards. Vaccine efficacy against 
severe RSV MA-LRTI was 81.8% at day 90, falling to 69.4% at day 180 but the lower bounds of the CI 
were >40% at each time point. Graphical display indicated separation of the curves from 2 weeks after 
birth onwards. Results were similar for the mITT population and planned sensitivity analyses.   
The indication statement should refer to passive protection of infants from birth to 6 months of age 
against RSV LRTI by means of vaccinating their mothers during pregnancy. Since this means rewording 
of the indication, there is a Major Objection although it can be resolved by simple editing.  
Safety in pregnant women and birth status of their infants 
The most common adverse reactions reported within the first 30 days included injection site reaction, 
redness and swelling. A higher percentage of pregnant woman given RSVpreF experienced local 
reactions compared to those given placebo. The incidence of systemic reactions was also higher in the 
pregnant population. The most frequently reported systemic event was fatigue, but this occurred with 
a similar frequency in both treated and placebo groups. Muscle pain and headache were more 
frequently reported in the RSVpreF group compared to placebo. However, there are no major safety 
concerns raised by the data. There was a slightly increased number of pregnant women in the upper 
middle-income group in the active treatment arm that had preterm births. The difference did not reach 
statistical significance, the absolute increase in number of preterm deliveries was small and did not 
result in a consequent increase in adverse neonatal outcomes. Maternal and infant outcomes will 
continue to be monitored in the planned post-authorisation studies. Overall vaccination during 
pregnancy did not affect rates of fetal loss, congenital abnormalities, developmental delays or preterm 
delivery and the condition of infants at birth was comparable between those born to vaccinated and 
unvaccinated mothers. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
RSVpreF has been shown to prevent RSV-LRTI in adults aged from 60 years and RSV-LRTI in infants 
born to vaccinated mothers for at least the first 6 months of life. There are no major safety concerns. 
From a clinical perspective, a positive benefit/risk balance in the proposed indications of prevention of 
LRTD caused by RSV can therefore be established.

Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Abrysvo is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Abrysvo is favourable in the following indication(s): 
• 
“Passive protection against lower respiratory tract disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV) in infants from birth through 6 months of age following maternal immunisation during 
pregnancy. See sections 4.2 and 5.1. 
•  Active immunisation of individuals 60 years of age and older for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subjects to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and

any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/351226/2023  
Page 150/151 
 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that RSV subgroup A glycoprotein 
F and RSV subgroup B glycoprotein F, stabilised in prefusion conformation and produced in Chinese 
Hamster Ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology, contained in the medicinal product Abrysvo,  is 
to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product 
previously authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths (men and women) worldwide, with 1.8 million 
new case diagnosed each year (World Health Organization, 20121). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for 80% to 85% of all new cases, which account for 
about 1.6 million deaths worldwide, each year. The most important risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco 
use.  
The majority of patients are not diagnosed until the tumour has progressed beyond the primary site. 
Despite recent advances in identifying optimal chemotherapy regimens, patients with advanced NSCLC 
continue  to  have  a  poor  prognosis.  Only  10%  to  15%  of  those  treated  are  still  alive  2  years  after 
diagnosis.  
Treatment of patients with lung cancer depends upon the subtype (NSCLC versus small cell lung cancer), 
histology (adenocarcinoma vs squamous cell carcinoma), tumour stage, molecular characteristics (e.g. 
mutation status of EGFR, ALK, RAS1 etc.), and an assessment of the patients’ overall medical condition. 
Patients with stage I, II, or III [according to the Union for International Cancer Control, Version 7 (UICC 
7)] NSCLC are generally treated with curative intent using surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or 
a combined modality approach. Systemic chemotherapy is generally indicated for patients who present 
metastatic  (stage  IV)  disease.  Palliative  systemic  chemotherapy  is  also  used  for  patients  who  have 
relapsed with advanced disease following prior definitive treatment.  
In  the  EU,  the  standard  first  line  chemotherapy  is  a  platinum-based  doublet  chemotherapy.  Third 
generation regimens including gemcitabine and taxanes could be used. Pemetrexed is also a treatment of 
choice in first line non-squamous NSCLC 2. 
About the product 
Abraxane (ABI-007) nanoparticle albumin-bound contains paclitaxel as active cytotoxic substance, and is 
indicated as a single agent, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in adult patients who 
have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard anthracycline containing 
therapy  is  not  indicated  and  in  the  adjuvant  setting.    The  approved  dosing  is  260  mg/m2  given 
intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. At the end 2013 the indication of Abraxane was extended 
in combination with gemcitabine for first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma 
of the pancreas. The approved dosage for this indication is 125 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 
30 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.   
Abraxane  was  developed  to  improve  the  therapeutic  index  of  paclitaxel  by  providing  an  alternative 
formulation free of ethanol and of the toxic solvent Cremophor-EL, two substances associated with severe 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers 
and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of the 
normal  dynamic  reorganisation  of  the  microtubule  network  that  is  essential  for  vital  interphase  and 
mitotic cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules 
throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.

Pharmacological classification (ATC-code): L01CD01 
The first marketing authorization for paclitaxel albumin was granted on 7 January 2005 in the USA. The 
initial European Union (EU) marketing authorization (EU/1/07/428/001-002) for Abraxane was granted 
on 11 January 2008.  
This  application  concerns  a  type  II  variation  (C.I.6)  for  the  following  extension  of  the  indication: 
“Abraxane in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung 
cancer in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy”.

(Y) 
As the total PECSURFACEWATER is above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L, a Phase II environmental fate and 
effects analysis is triggered and has been initiated by the MAH. 
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of paclitaxel to the environment.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for further investigation: 
- Conduct a phase II assessment including a refinement of Fpen.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of clinical studies have been conducted in order to investigate the PK of Abraxane (also known 
as ABI-007) in the applied indication. 
2.3.2.1.  BIO-VT-5 (CA031 substudy) 
The sparse PK profile of paclitaxel in European/US NSCLC patients who received the ABI-007/carboplatin 
combination therapy was presented in Report BIO-VT-5, the PK sub-study of study CA031. 
Methods 
Only those patients randomized to receive ABI-007/carboplatin treatment in Canada, Russia, Ukraine, 
and US had the option to participate in this PK sub-study. 
ABI-007 was administered to these patients by IV infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2. 
carboplatin was administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes at a dose of AUC = 6 min•mg/mL after the 
completion of ABI-007 infusion on Day 1. Blood samples for PK analysis were collected on Day 1 of Cycle 
1 at 0.75, 4, and 24.5 hours after the start of ABI-007 infusion (i.e., at 0.25, 3.5, and 24 hours after the 
end of the infusion). The concentration of paclitaxel in plasma was determined by a validated liquid 
chromatography atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. 
Results 
Of the 15 NSCLC patients who provided sparse PK samples, 14 patients were White (Non- Hispanic) and 
one patient was Black. There were 10 males and 5 females. The mean age of these patients was 54.8 
years (range: 39 to 68 years old) and mean weight was 79.4 kg (range: 53 to 125 kg). 
Due to the small sample size (N = 15), the population PK analysis was not conducted; however, the 
non-compartmental PK analysis was attempted for each patient. Because of the limited number of 
sampling time points available for the non-compartmental PK analysis, the estimates of PK parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 11/69 
 
  
  
 
are considered to be unreliable (Report BIO-VT-5). Therefore, only the concentration data are 
summarized and reported (Table 2). 
Table 2: Mean (SD) Plasma Concentration of paclitaxel in European/US NSCLC Patients 
Receiving ABI-007 and carboplatin 
The mean concentrations observed at 0.75 and 4 hours after the start of the infusion in European/US 
NSCLC patients (966 and 96.3 ng/mL, respectively) were comparable with the historical data observed in 
White patients with solid tumours (1117 and 91.7 ng/mL, respectively) who received the same dose of 
ABI-007 without concomitant carboplatin (CA005-0). The mean concentration at 4 hours was also 
consistent with that observed in Japanese NSCLC patients (89.1 ng/mL) who received the same 
ABI-007/carboplatin combination therapy (Report 08DA33). 
2.3.2.2.  08DA33 (CA031 substudy) 
Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Taiho) was the local Sponsor of study CA031 in Japan. In a PK sub-study 
of study CA031, Taiho also investigated the full PK profile of paclitaxel when given to NSCLC patients as 
ABI-007 in the absence and presence of carboplatin. In addition, Taiho assessed the PK of plasma total 
and free platinum after administration of carboplatin to the patients pre-infused with ABI-007. The results 
obtained from this PK sub-study were presented in Report 08DA33. 
Methods 
This was an open-label, multicentre, single-sequence, within patient comparison, PK sub-study. ABI-007 
was administered to these patients once a week (on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1) by IV infusion over 30 
minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2. carboplatin was administered by IV infusion over 60 minutes on Day 1 
after the completion of ABI-007 infusion. The dose of carboplatin was calculated according to the Calvert 
formula: carboplatin dose (mg) = (Target AUC) • (GFR + 25), where GFR was the glomerular filtration 
rate and AUC was for the free carboplatin in plasma. In this study, GFR was replaced with the creatinine 
clearance estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula. The carboplatin dose was chosen to achieve an AUC 
of 6 min•mg/mL for the free carboplatin in plasma. 
Serial sampling of blood for the determination of paclitaxel concentrations in plasma was performed for 
72 hours after the start of ABI-007 infusion on Days 1 and 15. Serial sampling of blood for the 
determination of platinum concentration in plasma was performed for 23.5 hours after the start of 
carboplatin infusion on Day 1. 
Results 
A total of 12 Japanese NSCLC patients who met the eligibility criteria of study CA031 participated in the 
study. The maximum concentration (Cmax) for paclitaxel was observed immediately after the infusion, 
and the mean concentration subsequently declined in a multiphasic manner (Figure 1). The mean 
paclitaxel concentration in plasma dropped by greater than 80% within 30 minutes after cessation of the 
ABI-007 infusion, followed by a terminal half-life (t 1/2) of 24.2 to 29.5 hours. There was no obvious

difference in the mean concentration-time profile for plasma paclitaxel between Day 1 (first ABI-007 dose 
and in the presence of carboplatin) and Day 15 (third ABI-007 dose and in the absence of carboplatin) 
(Figure 1). 
Table 3 compares the plasma paclitaxel PK parameters between Day 1 and Day 15. The mean total 
clearance (CL) values (21 to 25.9 L/h/m2) on both days were within the range observed in Japanese or 
White patients with solid tumours (17.9 to 30.6 L/h/m2) (05DA11 and CA005-0). The exposure levels 
(Cmax and AUC) on both days were also comparable with those observed in Japanese or White patients 
who received the same dose of ABI-007 alone.

There was a statistically significant difference for AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC∞) 
between the two days (Day 1 to Day 15 ratio of geometric means = 0.85, 90% confidence interval [CI] = 
0.76 to 0.95, p = 0.031). However, the difference was not clinically meaningful (15% difference in 
geometric means for AUC∞) and the sample size was too small to exclude an artificial effect. Table 4 
summarizes plasma carboplatin PK parameters derived from the plasma concentration time curve for 
total platinum (protein-bound plus unbound) and free platinum (protein-unbound) on the basis of a 
carboplatin/platinum molar ratio of 1.903. The observed mean AUC∞ for free carboplatin in plasma was 
7.41 min•mg/mL, approximately 24% higher than the targeted value (6 min•mg/mL). However, the 
mean t 1/2 and CL for total and free carboplatin were consistent with those reported in the absence of 
paclitaxel (Obasaju, 1996), thereby excluding the possibility of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.

2.3.2.3.  05DA11 (J-0101): Single-dose PK in Japanese Patients with Solid Tumours 
Methods 
A Phase 1, open label, single-centre, parallel group, dose-escalation study was conducted by Taiho in 
Japan to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK after the administration of ABI-007 once a week to 
patients with advanced solid tumours. ABI-007 was administered at 80, 100, or 125 mg/m2 by IV infusion 
over 30 minutes. Serial sampling of blood was performed for up to 72 hours after dosing on Day 1. The 
concentration of paclitaxel in blood and plasma was determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method. 
Results 
The PK of paclitaxel was determined in 15 patients after the first ABI-007 dose (Day 1). 
Table 5 summarizes paclitaxel PK parameters in plasma at various dose levels of ABI-007. Mean Cmax and 
AUC of paclitaxel increased as the dose of ABI-007 increased. Because of the narrow dose range, it was 
difficult to evaluate the dose proportionality of the systemic exposure for paclitaxel within this study. 
However, there was no apparent dose dependence in the mean value for t 1/2, CL, and Vss, which was 
consistent with the linear PK. Similar results were observed for paclitaxel PK parameters in whole blood 
(data not shown).

Methods 
A Phase 1, open-label, multicentre, parallel group, dose-escalation study was conducted by Taiho in 
Japan to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK after the administration of ABI-007 to patients with 
advanced solid tumours once every 3 weeks. The PK of paclitaxel was determined in 12 patients after the 
first ABI-007 dose (Day 1). ABI-007 was administered at 200, 260, or 300 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 30 
minutes. Serial sampling of blood was performed for up to 72 hours after dosing on Day 1. 
Results 
Table 6 summarizes paclitaxel PK parameters in plasma at various dose levels of ABI-007. Mean Cmax and 
AUC of paclitaxel increased as the dose increased. Because of the narrow dose range, it was difficult to 
evaluate the dose proportionality of the systemic exposure for paclitaxel within this study. Mean t1/2 and 
CL appeared to decrease slightly with an increase of the ABI-007 dose from 200 to 300 mg/m2. Similar 
results were observed for paclitaxel PK parameters in whole blood.

Japanese Patients with Solid Tumours (200 to 300 mg/m2) 
2.3.2.5.  Potential of Drug-Drug Interactions with carboplatin 
Paclitaxel is highly bound to serum proteins (89%-98%). It is metabolized primarily in liver by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP 3A4 (Taxol prescribing information [PI]; Abraxane PI). Urinary 
excretion of the unchanged drug only accounted for approximately 4% of the dose (260 mg/m2) while 
urinary excretion of the two metabolites, 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, was less than 
0.2% of the dose (CA012-0). In contrast, carboplatin is not bound to plasma proteins. The major route of 
elimination of carboplatin is renal excretion of the unchanged drug, with approximately 71% of the dose 
excreted in urine within 24 hours (Paraplatin PI). In addition, there have been no reports indicating that 
carboplatin is an inhibitor or inducer of any CYP enzymes. Thus, paclitaxel and carboplatin are not 
expected to interact with each other via competing for protein binding or affecting the same clearance 
pathways. 
The pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between solvent-based paclitaxel (Taxol) and carboplatin 
were previously investigated in clinical studies (Obasaju, 1996; Belani, 1999). These studies concluded 
that there were no pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between the two compounds. Further, 
alteration of the infusion sequence for solvent-based paclitaxel and carboplatin did not affect the 
exposure of paclitaxel or the degree of neutropenia in NSCLC patients (Huizing, 1997). 
Consistent with the previously mentioned findings, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were not 
observed between paclitaxel and carboplatin in Japanese NSCLC patients who received the 
ABI-007/carboplatin combination therapy (study 08DA33). In addition, alteration of the infusion 
sequence between ABI-007 and carboplatin did not affect the PK of paclitaxel and the nadir of the 
absolute neutrophil counts in US patients with solid tumours (Stinchcombe, 2007). 
2.3.2.6.  Relationship Between ABI-007 Dose and Plasma paclitaxel Exposure 
The dose proportionality from 80 to 300 mg/m2 in Japanese patients was explored by using the ABI-007 
dose and mean plasma AUC∞ data combined from Report 05DA11 and Report 05DA13 (see Table 5 and 
Table 6) according to the following equation:  
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 16/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Ln(AUC∞) = a + b•Ln(Dose), where a = intercept and b = slope of the regression line.  
The slope of Ln(AUC∞) versus Ln(Dose) was close to 1 (1.11) and the 90% CI for the slope contained 1 
(0.94 to 1.28). This result indicated that an increase in ABI-007 dose resulted in approximately a 
proportional increase in plasma exposure from 80 to 300 mg/m2. Similarly, plasma paclitaxel AUC∞ was 
approximately proportional to the dose of ABI-007 from 80 to 200 mg/m2 in White patients (Figure 2). 
The plasma data at higher doses of ABI-007 (> 200 mg/m2) were lacking in White patients. Since there 
was no racial difference in the PK of paclitaxel, doses of ABI-007 up to 300 mg/m2 in White patients are 
not expected to depart considerably from the dose proportionality observed in Japanese patients.  
Figure 2: Relationship between Plasma paclitaxel Exposure and Dose of ABI-007 
2.3.2.7.  Comparison of PK between patients with solid tumours and NSCLC 
Since coadministration of ABI-007 and carboplatin is not likely to result in pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions (Section 2.3.2.5), the impact of the type of tumours on PK of paclitaxel was explored by 
comparing the single-dose PK data between the NSCLC studies (ABI-007/carboplatin combination) and 
the solid tumour studies (ABI-007 alone).  
As shown in Figure 3, the mean plasma concentrations of paclitaxel at 0.75, 4, and 24.5 hours after 
dosing from European/US NSCLC patients who received the combination therapy of ABI-007/carboplatin 
(Report BIO-VT-5) were superimposed with the mean concentration-time profile from White patients with 
solid tumours who received the same dose of ABI-007 (100 mg/m2) without concomitant carboplatin 
(CA005-0). According to this similarity, tumour type is not expected to have a significant effect on the PK 
parameters of paclitaxel after ABI-007 administration. The single-dose PK parameters of paclitaxel 
observed in Japanese NSCLC patients receiving ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin were almost 
identical to those in the historical data observed in Japanese solid tumour patients receiving ABI-007 
alone (Table 3).

2.3.2.8.  Comparison of PK between Japanese and white patients 
Table 7 compares the demographic data and the PK of paclitaxel between Japanese and White patients 
who received a single dose of ABI-007 at 100 mg/m2. Mean plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC∞) was 
comparable between Japanese and White patients with solid tumours. The mean CL was almost identical 
between the two ethnic groups. Mean t1/2 appeared shorter in White patients with solid tumours 
compared with the corresponding Japanese patients (18.2 vs 26.1 hours). This difference can be 
explained by the different PK sampling duration between the two studies (48 vs 72 hours). Overall, these 
data suggested that there was no race/ethnicity-associated difference in the PK of paclitaxel after 
ABI-007 administration between Japanese and White patients with solid tumours.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To support the combination of Abraxane with carboplatin for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), pharmacokinetic data of paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin were collected in two 
sub-studies of the pivotal study CA031. In addition, data from studies J-0100 and J-0101 in Japanese 
patients were used in across-study comparisons to evaluate the dose dependency of ABI-007 and effect 
of race (Japanese) on the PK of paclitaxel after ABI-007 administration. The pharmacokinetic data were 
in agreement with the pharmacokinetics submitted in the initial MAA for breast cancer.  
The key clinical PK evaluations for ABI-007 to support this application for the first-line treatment of NSCLC 
are: 
The PK profile of paclitaxel in NSCLC patients who received combination therapy with 
• 
ABI-007/carboplatin at the recommended dosing regimens (100 mg/m2 for ABI-007 and AUC = 6 for 
carboplatin) was similar to that observed in patients with solid tumours who received the same dose of 
ABI-007 alone (study CA031). 
• 
No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed between paclitaxel and carboplatin in 
Japanese NSCLC patients who received the ABI-007/carboplatin combination therapy (study CA031). 
Plasma paclitaxel exposure increased linearly with ABI-007 dose over dose range of 80 to 
• 
300 mg/m2 (studies J-0100 and J-0101).  
• 
Although the full PK profile of paclitaxel from White NSCLC patients receiving ABI-007, was not 
available, the limited concentration data obtained from the European/US NSCLC patients (Report 
BIO-VT-5) allowed a comparison of the concentration profile of plasma paclitaxel between Japanese and 
European/US NSCLC patients who received the same ABI-007 (100 mg/m2)/carboplatin (AUC = 6 
min•mg/mL) combination therapy on Day 1 of Cycle 1. There was no difference in the PK of paclitaxel 
after ABI-007 administration between Japanese and White patients (studies CA031, J-0100 and J-0101). 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel to support the dosing regimen of Abraxane 100 mg/m2 qd with 
carboplatin AUC = 6 mg•min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, have been sufficiently investigated 
and are supportive for the use as first-line treatment of NSCLC in adult patients who are not candidates 
for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. In addition, based on the evidence presented, 
co-administration of Abraxane and carboplatin is not likely to result in pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The posology of Abraxane used in the pivotal CA031 study was supported by results from the Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 studies CA015 and CA028. 
CA015 
Study CA015 was an open-label, Phase I/II trial in  which  Abraxane as single agent was administered 
weekly to chemotherapy naïve patients with advanced NSCLC. The study was designed to determine the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of weekly Abraxane and to evaluate the 
safety/tolerability and anti-tumour effect of Abraxane at the MTD.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 20/69 
 
  
  
This study had two phases. In the first phase the MTD and DLT was determined using protocol-specified 
criteria. Once the weekly MTD was determined, the patients in the second phase of the study were treated 
at  the  MTD  to  further  characterize  the  safety/tolerability  of  Abraxane  and  to  evaluate  the  potential 
anti-tumour  activity.  In  the  Phase  II  portion  of  the  study,  patient  response  was  evaluated  by  the 
investigator. It was planned to enrol 3-6 patients per dose level (between 15 to 24 patients) for Phase 1 
MTD portion plus an additional 65 patients for the Phase II portion of the study.  
Four dose levels were planned for the MTD Phase I portion of the study; 100 mg/m2, 125 mg/m2, 150 
mg/m2 and 175 mg/m2. Because DLTs were observed in the 150 mg/m2 dose, escalation to 175 mg/m2 
dose was not initiated. For the phase II portion of the study, patients were administered 125 mg/m2 over 
30 minutes or 2 hours. The 2 hour dosing window was selected to determine if a longer duration of dosing 
would mitigate reports of peripheral neuropathy.  
Efficacy 
In total of 77 patients were enrolled in study CA015. In the Phase II portion of the study, an objective 
overall  response  (confirmed  CR  or  PR)  was  observed  in  18  patients.  One  patient  had  a  CR  and  the 
remaining 17 patients were PRs.  
Overall response rates ranged from 14.3% to 33.3% (in 150 mg/m2 dose and 100 mg/m2 dose groups 
respectively). For all doses over 30 minutes, the average response rate was 28%. For patients in the 
100 mg/m2 dose group, the response date was 33.3% (1 of 3 patients). For the 125 mg/m2 dose over 30 
minutes, the response rate was 30% (12 of 40 patients). For the 150 mg/m2 dose, the response rate was 
14.2% (1 of 7 patients). The ORR for patients who received Abraxane at the 125 mg/m2 over 2 hours was 
16% (4 of 25 patients).  
Safety 
For  the  phase  I  portion  the  DLTs  that  were  identified  included  febrile  neutropenia  (grade  3)  sensory 
neuropathy (grade 3) and motor neuropathy (grade 3). The MTD was determined to be 125 mg/m2. 
All 75 patients who participated in study CA015 reported at least 1 AE. The most commonly reported 
non-haematological toxicity was fatigue, which occurred in 83% of the patients dosed with any dose of 
Abraxane over 30 minutes. 
Grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related toxicities were reported among all patients who received 100 
mg/m2, 125 mg/m2 or 150 mg/m2 in the 30 minute dose duration. Among the patients who received 125 
mg/m2  over  2  hours,  14  treatment-related  grade  3  and  1  treatment-related  grade  4  events  were 
reported.  The  most  severe  event  for  any  patient  administered  100  mg/m2  was  a  grade  3  event  of 
constipation. Among the events experienced by the patients who received 125 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, 
the most severe were two grade 4 events of neutropenia. Among the events reported by the patients who 
received 150 mg/m2, the most severe were six grade 3 events. Toxicities including sensory neuropathy, 
were similar across all dose levels and both dose durations.  
Over the course of the study, 3 patients experienced AEs that resulted in death. None of the deaths were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to study drug.   
In an exploratory manner, Abraxane was evaluated at the MTD over 30 minutes and 2 hours to determine 
if  duration  of  dosing  would  mitigate  reports  of  peripheral  neuropathy.  Length  of  dosing  duration  and 
presumed reduction of peak drug levels (due to long dosing) did not on average impact the Investigator 
rating  of  patient  perception  of  peripheral  neuropathy.  However,  the  number  of  grade  2  and  Grade  3 
incidence of peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia were reduced in the longer dosing group.   
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 21/69 
 
  
  
 
 
For monotherapy Abraxane a DLT was observed at a weekly dose of the 150 mg/m2, therefore from a 
safety perspective, the use of this dose in combination therapy is ruled out. At all tested dosages (100 
mg/m2, 125 mg/m2 and 150 mg/m2) anti-tumour responses were reported, with no clear dose response 
correlation.  The  number  of  patients  treated  with  each  dose  was  too  limited  to  draw  any  conclusion 
regarding the optimal dose of Abraxane monotherapy regarding to efficacy.  
Limited  data  suggest  that  the  Grade  2  and  3  neuropathy  and  neutropenia  was  slightly  reduced  by 
prolongation of the infusion time from 30 minutes to 2 hours, however response rate for the long infusion 
time was lower.   
CA028 
Study  CA028  was  a  multi-centre,  open-label,  Phase  II  Trial  of  increasing  doses  of  Abraxane  and 
carboplatin in patients with advanced NSCLC.  
The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  obtain  preliminary  data  on  the  anti  tumor  activity  and 
adverse  events  (AEs)  of  Abraxane  in  combination  with  carboplatin.  The  secondary  objectives  were  to 
evaluate the percentage of patients with stable disease (SD) for ≥ 16 weeks, or complete or partial overall 
response (i.e., total response); PFS, duration of response and patient survival.   
Patients were treated with Abraxane doses plus carboplatin in 7 cohorts of 25 patients. The first 4 cohorts 
of this have examined increasing q3w doses of Abraxane (225, 260, 300 and 340 mg/m2) in combination 
with  carboplatin.  The  260  mg/m2  dose  corresponded  to  the  dose  of  Abraxane  that  was  compared  to 
solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 in women with breast cancer. The highest dose levels explored (300 
and 340 mg/m2 q3w) corresponded to approximately 50% increases of doses of solvent-based paclitaxel 
(200 to 225 mg/m2) used in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of NSCLC patients.  
The fifth cohort studied Abraxane 140 mg/m2 given on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Patients in the sixth 
cohort were treated with 100 mg/m2 Abraxane administrated on days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks. Finally 
the seventh cohort studied weekly administration of Abraxane at a dose of 125 mg/m2, in an attempt to 
further increase the Abraxane dose intensity. Besides the patients included in the different cohorts of this 
study, an additional 75 patients were treated at a dose of 340 mg/m2 q3w. In all treatment regimens, 
Abraxane  was  given  IV  over  approximately  30  minutes  without  steroid  premedication  and  without 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis (unless supportive treatment was indicated based on 
AEs). All patients received carboplatin AUC=6 on Day 1 of the treatment cycle.   
Efficacy 
Results  for  objective  response  rate,  SD≥  16  weeks,  and  total  response  (objective  response  SD≥16 
weeks) are presented by patient cohort in table 8.

Table 8: Response Rate and Stable Disease at ≥16 weeks by dose cohort 
There was no apparent direct dose proportional relationship observed in objective response rate across 
the q3w or weekly cohorts in terms of Abraxane planned dose. In general, response rate was not lower for 
the weekly regimens and in fact, there was a tendency for improved response rate in the weekly cohorts.  
Table 9: Progression-free survival by dose cohort 
There was no apparent direct dose proportional relationship observed in PFS across the q3w cohorts or 
the weekly cohorts in terms of Abraxane planned dose.  
Other efficacy endpoints were Time to progression, duration of response, and OS. There was no clear 
difference between the cohorts in overall patient survival. There was a trend toward more consistent time 
to tumour progression (TTP) among the weekly cohorts compared to the q3w cohorts. 
Safety 
The  most  common  non-hematologic  treatment-related  adverse  event  was  peripheral  neuropathy 
occurring in 184/251 (73%) of all treated patients. A total of 50 (20%) of all treated patients had Grade 
3  treatment-related  peripheral  neuropathy.  None  of  the  patients  had  Grade  4  peripheral  neuropathy. 
Treatment–related peripheral neuropathy was greater in the q3w groups (ranging from 64-92%) than in 
the  weekly  groups  (48%-56%).  Grade  3  treatment-related  peripheral  neuropathy  ranged  between 
12-48% in the q3w groups, and between 8-16% in the weekly groups. A dose (mg/m2/week) relationship 
was observed in both the q3w and weekly cohorts in the incidence of both any peripheral neuropathy and 
Grade 3 neuropathy.

The most common hematologic adverse event was neutropenia, occurring in 210/251 (84%) of all treated 
patients. Neutropenia occurred in 82 (82%) patients in the initial four q3w cohorts, in 81 (80%) patients 
given Abraxane 340 mg/m2 q3w, and in 66 (88%) of patients on weekly regimens of Abraxane. Grade 3 
or higher treatment related neutropenia occurred in 55 (55%) patients in the initial four q3w cohorts, in 
50 (50%) patients given Abraxane 340  mg/m2 q3w and in 50 (67%) of patients on weekly regimens of 
Abraxane. 
Table 10: Most Frequently-occurring Adverse Events of Grade 3 or Higher by NCI CTCAE Term 
(Reported in ≥10% for Patients in Any Cohort) 
A total of 22 events resulted in death. Of those, 7 were considered treatment-related. Treatment related 
death was reported for the following treatment cohorts; one in the 225 mg/m2 q3w, 3 in the 300 mg/m2 
q3w, 2 in the 340 mg/m2 q3w and 1 in the weekly 100 mg/m2 cohort. Reported fatal AEs included systolic 
dysfunction, haemorrhage bleeding, infection and ischemia. Serious adverse events were experienced by 
28% of patients in the q3w cohorts, primarily due to thrombocytopenia (6%) and neutropenia (4%) and 
by 24% of patients in the weekly cohorts, primarily due to thrombocytopenia (11%).  
The percentage of patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent toxicity leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment ranged between 20% (260 mg/m2 q3w) and 60% (340 mg/m2 q3w) 
in the q3w cohorts and between 20% (100 mg/m2 weekly) and 36% (125 mg/m2 weekly) in the weekly 
cohorts. The most common toxicities that led to discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and peripheral 
neuropathy in the 3qw cohorts, and thrombocytopenia and neutropenia in the weekly cohorts.  
For study CA028, in general, with comparable cumulative Abraxane exposure, the rate of adverse events 
was mostly lower with the weekly relative to the 3 weeks Abraxane schedules. In particular, the incidence 
of neuropathy seems to be lower with weekly administration of Abraxane, whereas the incidence of 
neutrophil toxicity was slightly higher for the weekly cohorts in comparison to the 3qw cohorts. Efficacy 
results for ORR were best for the weekly 100 mg/m2 cohort and 140 mg/m2 q2/3w cohort (48% and 56% 
respectively). ORR regarded only PR. No CR was documented. 
In combination with carboplatin the toxicity of the weekly 125 mg/m2 dose was substantially higher than 
the toxicity for the weekly 100 mg/m2, whereas the median cumulative Abraxane exposure for the 125 
mg/m2  dose was lower than for the 100 mg/m2 and the efficacy results was not clearly better. Also the 
toxicity in the 300 mg/m2 and the 340 mg/m2 q3w cohorts was high in relation to the 225 q3w, 260 q3w,

140 q2/3w and weekly 100 mg/m2 cohorts, whereas the median PFS was shorter in the 300 and 340 
mg/m2 cohort  than in the other cohorts.   
The response rate reported for weekly Abraxane 100 mg/m2 in combination with carboplatin was better 
than the response rate reported for  Abraxane monotherapy at every dose tested in study CA015 
(Abraxane 100 mg/m2/carboplatin qd CR: 4 % and PR 44 % and Abraxane mono 125 mg/m2 qd: ORR 
30%).  
2.4.2.  Main studies 
CA031 - A randomized, phase III trial of ABI-007 and carboplatin compared with Taxol and 
carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Methods 
Study CA031 was a controlled, randomized, multicentre, Phase 3 study evaluating the safety/tolerability 
and  anti-tumour  effect  of  intravenously  (IV)  administered  Abraxane/carboplatin  combination  therapy 
compared  with  that  of  Taxol/carboplatin  combination  therapy  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with 
advanced NSCLC.  
Study participants 
For study CA031, patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIb or IV NSCLC were 
included.  
Patients  with  radiographically  documented  measurable  disease  (defined  by  the  presence  of  ≥  1 
radiographically documented measurable lesion) were included. 
Patients that were included had no prior chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Adjuvant 
chemotherapy  was  permitted  providing  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  was  completed  12  months  prior  to 
starting the study. 
Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2, 3 or 4, or serious medical risk factors involving any of 
the  major  organ  systems  were  excluded  from  the  study.  In  addition,  patients  were  excluded  if  they 
received radiotherapy in the preceding 4 weeks, except if to a non-target lesion only. Prior radiation to a 
target lesion was permitted only if there had been clear progression of the lesion since radiation was 
completed. 
Treatments 
Abraxane 
The Abraxane dose used in this study was 100 mg/m2 given weekly (i.e. on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 
21-day cycle) in combination with carboplatin (AUC=6 mg•min/mL) every 3 weeks (i.e.  on Day 1 only of 
each  21-day  cycle  beginning  immediately  after  the  end  of  Abraxane  administration).  Abraxane  was 
administered  IV  over  approximately  30  minutes  without  steroid  premedication  and  without  G-CSF 
prophylaxis.   
Taxol  
The used Taxol dose was 200 mg/m2 administered once every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion over 3 
hours with standard premedication, immediately followed by carboplatin administered intravenously at 
AUC = 6 mg•min/mL. Each drug was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.  
In  both  study  arms  treatment  was  administered  until  disease  progression  or  development  of  an 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms.

Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of this study was to compare disease response (using Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumour, version 1.0) of Abraxane/carboplatin versus Taxol/carboplatin as first line therapy in 
patients  with  advanced  NSCLC.  The  null  hypothesis  of  this  study  was  that  the  Abraxane/carboplatin 
regimen response rate was non-inferior to that of the Taxol/carboplatin regimen. 
Main Secondary Objectives 
-  Compare the frequency of toxicities grade using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) 
-  Compare PFS 
-  Compare overall survival 
-  Compare duration of response in responding patients 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved an objective confirmed CR or 
PR based on the blinded radiological review using RECIST response guidelines (Version 1.0). 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
- 
PFS defined as the time from the day of randomization to the start of disease progression or death 
(any cause), whichever occurred first, based on the blinded radiological review assessment of 
response. 
-  OS defined as the time from the day of randomization to patients death (any cause). 
- 
- 
Evaluation  of  PK  parameters  (Cmax,  AUC,  AUCinf,  T1/2,  total  body  clearance  and  volume  of 
distribution.  
Percentage of patients with stable disease for ≥16 weeks or confirmed CR or PR response (i.e., 
disease control rate) 
-  Duration of response in responding patients 
-  Correlation of SPARC and other molecular biomarker with efficacy outcomes 
Sample size 
Phase III data on Taxol plus carboplatin showed a response rate of 17% in patients previously untreated 
for advanced NSCLC (Schiller, 2002). The applicant assumed that Abraxane plus carboplatin would have 
a  response  rate  of  24%  (a  relative  improvement  of  approximately  40%  over  Taxol  plus  carboplatin). 
Based on this assumption, a sample size of 525 patients per arm in the ITT analysis would provide 80% 
power with a 2 sided type 1 error of 0.049 to reject the null hypothesis that the Abraxane/carboplatin 
response rate was equal to that of Taxol/carboplatin. 
An interim analysis of response rate was performed after 200 patients per arm had completed the second 
response  assessment.  The  purpose  of  this  interim  analysis  was  to  evaluate  the  initial  assumption  of 
treatment difference in response rate (24% vs 17%). If the treatment difference at the interim analysis 
was lower than assumed, the sample size was to be increased accordingly. 
Randomisation 
The  randomization  schedule  was  generated  by  a  randomization  statistician  from  the  sponsor.  The 
randomization  was  implemented  via  ICON  Interactive  Voice  Response  (IVR)  system.  Patients  were 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio and the randomization was stratified by the following strata: 
-  Disease stage (IIIb vs IV) 
-  Age (<70 years vs ≥70 years) 
-  Gender (male vs female) 
-  Histology (squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma versus other histology) 
-  Geographic region (North America vs Australia/New Zealand vs Eastern Europe vs Asia/Pacific) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. Blinding was not feasible due the differences in study drug appearance, the 
frequency and duration of administration, and the required administration of premedication for Taxol. 
Statistical methods 
General remarks of the final statistical analysis plan: 
•  Data from all study centres were combined for analysis 
•  All statistical tests of the treatment effect preserved a significance level of 0.050 for 2 –side tests. 
Testing of interactions was performed at the 0.100 significance level 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 27/69 
 
  
  
• 
The day of the first dose of any study drug was defined as Day 1; baseline was defined as the last 
value before the first study drug dose; and final evaluation was defined as the last on-treatment 
value. 
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved an objective confirmed CR or 
PR based on the blinded radiological review. 
The  null  hypothesis  was  that  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  regimen  response  rate  was  equal  to  that  of 
Taxol/carboplatin regimen, hereby would the ratio of response for the Abraxane arm versus the Taxol arm 
(pA/pT) be 1. Superiority of Abraxane/carboplatin to Taxol/carboplatin was to be established if the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of pA/pT is >1. 
An interim analysis of response rate was to be performed after 200 patients per arm have completed the 
second treatment response assessment. An alpha spending function was to be utilized to preserve the 
overall Type 1 error at 0.050. This spending function allocate alpha of 0.001 and 0.049 at the interim and 
final analyses of response rate, respectively (Haybittle, 1971; Peto, 1977). 
Treatment regimen comparison of response rates was tested using the chi-square test.  
Exploratory analyses were performed to assess the potential influence of the following prognostic factors 
on  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  objective  response:  Region,  Gender,  Race,  Age,  Smoking  Status, 
Baseline ECOG, Time from date of primary diagnosis to date of study entry, Stage at Primary Diagnosis, 
Histology at Primary Diagnosis, Time from date of first documented metastasis/relapse to date of study 
entry, Stage at current Diagnosis, Number of Lesion. 
For each prognostic factor, its effect on objective response was tested using a logistic regression model 
with  effects  for  treatment  regimen,  prognostic  factor  and  treatment  regimen  by  prognostic  factor 
interaction. If the interaction was significant, then the nature of the interaction was evaluated.  
Analysis of key secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  to  be  analysed  only  if  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  displayed 
superiority of Abraxane/carboplatin over Taxol/carboplatin. To control the overall family-wise Type I error 
rate  at  2-sided  alpha=0.050  for  the  2  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  PFS  was  tested  first  at 
alpha=0.050; OS was tested at alpha=0.050 only if PFS showed significant improvement.  
Progression-free survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods. The final analysis for PFS was 
to be conducted once 70% of patients had an event of disease progression or death (any cause).  
Overall survival (OS) was analysed in a similar manner to PFS. The final analysis for OS was conducted 
once 70% of patients had died. 
An addendum to the Statistical analysis Plan was finalized on 11 April 2011. The addendum was prepared 
prior to the final database lock and prior to the PFS and OS analyses. The following issues were addressed 
by the addendum: 
• 
Progression-free survival per European Medicines Agency (EMA) methodological considerations 
for PFS endpoint 
•  Non-inferiority analysis consistent with recommendations of EMA guidelines 
•  Supportive analysis of non-inferiority based on OS 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 28/69 
 
  
  
Non-inferiority of Abraxane/carboplatin compared with Taxol/carboplatin for PFS and OS was assessed 
based on the upper bound of the 95% CI of the HR (HRA/T). If the upper bound is less than 1.176, the 
non-inferiority was considered met. 
As  the  upper  bound  of  the  95.1%  CI  is  larger  than  the  upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI,  by  convention, 
non-inferiority also was established if the upper bound of the 95.1% CI was <1.176. For OS, recalculation 
of the 95% CI was done only if the 95.1% CI was not sufficient to meet this criterion.  
PFS was chosen as the primary endpoint of these non-inferiority analyses. For the non-inferiority PFS 
analysis as well as supportive non-inferiority OS analysis, the non-inferiority margin was chosen as 15%, 
i.e., when the upper bound of the 95% CI of the HR (HRA/T) was less than 1.176, then non-inferiority 
criterion was considered met.  
The selection of this margin was based on regulatory precedence (i.e., Alimta, Xeloda) and an assessment 
of clinical benefit based on a meta-analysis of relevant historical studies. 
To evaluate the impact of 15% non-inferiority margin, the relative efficacy of Abraxane/carboplatin over 
“Placebo” (i.e., Etoposide/cisplatin combination in this case) was projected when Abraxane/carboplatin 
sits at the margin. 
Results 
Participant flow 
At the time of the final analysis of study CA031, based on the data cut-off of 31 January 2011, of the 1038 
treated patients, 1035 patients had discontinued study treatment and 3 patients were still on therapy. 
These 3 patients had discontinued from the study by 21 December 2012.

Recruitment 
In total 1052 patients were enrolled for study CA031. First patient was enrolled on 14 December 2007, 
last patients completed study treatment at 21 December 2012. The data cut-off date for analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint of ORR was 12 October 2009 (the date at which the last randomized patient 
completed the second response assessment). The data cut-off date for the final analysis was 31 January 
2011.  
A total of 102 study sites enrolled patients including 29 sites in Russia, 25 sites in the US, 21 sites in Japan, 
16 sites in Ukraine, 6 sites in Canada and 5 sites in Australia. 
Conduct of the study 
Fourteen patients were randomized but were not dosed; 7 due to investigator discretion, 3 due to adverse 
events, 3 due to protocol deviations and 1 due to withdrawal of consent.  
The proportion of treated patients in the ITT population was the same for each treatment arm (99%).  
As of the 31 January 2011 cut-off date, >99% of patients had discontinued study treatment. In both 
treatment arms, the most common reason for discontinuation was progressive disease (52% overall). 
The other reasons for discontinuation were similar for the 2 treatment arms (investigator discretion, 
patient discretion, and unacceptable toxicity). The group of patients who discontinued treatment due to 
investigator discretion included; “patient’s interest/benefit,” “6 cycles completed,” and “further 
treatment is no longer beneficial for the patient”. One patient was randomized twice. This patient was 
discontinued after the first randomization because the site had already reached the maximum enrolment 
allowed per site. The patient was re-randomized after the planned number of patients per site was 
increased. The patients was assigned at the second randomization but excluded from the analyses in 
order to maintain a true ITT population.

The percentage of patients with a relative favourable prognosis, who never smoked seems to be high, but 
between  treatment  arms  the  percentage  of  “never  smoked”  patients  is  comparable  (32%  and  28%). 
Around the 50% of patients in both treatment arm were diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma.  
In both arms, the majority of patients were randomized within one month of their lung cancer diagnosis, 
with a median time from primary diagnosis to enrolment of 0.7 months, and a median time from first 
documented metastasis/relapse to study entry of 0.5 months. 
Prior chemotherapy was uncommon, reported in only 3% of enrolled patients. 
Numbers analysed 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT population, which includes all randomized patients 
regardless of whether the patient received any study drug or had any efficacy assessments collected. 
There were 521 patients in the ITT population in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 531 patients in the 
ITT population in the Taxol/carboplatin arm (1052 patients in total). 
Outcomes and estimation 
ORR 
The proportion of patients with a confirmed complete or partial overall response per the blinded radiology 
assessment  was  significantly  higher 
for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  regimen  relative  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin regimen (33% versus 25%, p=0.005; response rate ratio [pz/pT]=1.313).

Blinded Radiological Assessment of Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
For the Abraxane/carboplatin arm the median PFS was 6.3 months (95% CI=5.6, 7.0 months), while for 
the Taxol/carboplatin arm the median PFS was 5.8 months (95% CI=5.6, 6.7 months). The HR A/T was 
0.92 (95.1% CI=0.767, 1.060). The  PFS difference  between the arms was not statistically significant 
(p=0.214). 
Table  15:  Progression-free  Survival  determined  by  Blinded  Radiology  Assessment  (ITT 
Population) CA031 
The investigator assessed median PFS in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm was 5.5 months (95% CI=5.1, 
5.7)  and  5.4  months  (95%  CI=5.1,  5.6  months)  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm.  The  difference  was 
statistically non-significant (p=0.371), which is in line with the PFS results of the IRR.   
The Figure below presents the Kaplan Meier curve for PFS for each treatment regimen. The KM estimated 
patients  without  an  event  (progression  or  death)  at  6  months  (52%  versus  49%),  12  months  (22% 
versus 19%) and 18 months (11% versus 9%) was numerically higher in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm 
versus the Taxol/carboplatin arm.

Although  the  difference  in  PFS  between  treatment  arms  was  not  statistically  significant,  the  point 
estimated median PFS for the Abraxane/carboplatin arm was higher than for the Taxol/carboplatin arm 
(6.3 versus 5.8 months respectively).  
A  high  percentage  (43%  and  41%  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  and  Taxol/carboplatin  arm 
respectively) of patients in this PFS analysis were censored. The two most common reasons for censoring 
were discontinuation of scanning by the investigator for progressive disease (per protocol 28% and 25%, 
respectively) and onset of another  anticancer therapy or lesion site surgery (8% for both arms).

Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier Curve of Overall Survival (ITT Population) CA031 
A total of 31% of Abraxane/carboplatin patients and 28% of Taxol/carboplatin patients were censored. 
The most common reasons for censoring were that the patients had completed 18 months of follow-up 
(13% and 12%, respectively) and that follow-up for survival was on-going (13% and 11%, respectively).

Time from primary diagnosis 
For the time from primary diagnosis to randomization, a treatment interaction was found on ORR and 
PFS,  but  not  OS.  In  addition,  while  patients  whose  time  from  date  of  the  first  documented 
metastasis/relapse to date of study entry was < 1 month showed similar PFS in both treatment arms, 
patients in the Abraxane treatment arm whose time since documented metastasis/relapse was ≥1 month 
displayed improved PFS compared to Taxol treated patients (data not shown).

Ancillary analyses 
In order to investigate whether there is a benefit in treating patients for more than 6 cycles , analyses of 
PFS and OS were conducted in responders treated for ≤ 6 cycles and > 6 cycles.

Additional  and  sensitivity  analysis  were  conducted  including:  sensitivity  analysis  regarding  censored 
patients in the PFS analysis and regarding the impact of second-line therapy for the OS results.  The 
results of the additional and sensitivity analysis were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Based  on  the  EMA  methodological  considerations  for  PFS,  a  subsequent  non-inferiority  analysis  was 
conducted  for  PFS  and  OS,  with  a  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  15%.  The  non-inferiority 
criterion  was  met  for  both  PFS  and  OS  with  the  upper  bound  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  the 
associated hazard ratios being less than 1.176 (Table 24).

therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC and to evaluate the safety/tolerability of Abraxane in this study 
population. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients in the treated population who 
achieved an objective confirmed complete or partial response.  Secondary objectives were to evaluate 
disease control rate (proportion of patients with SC ≥ 16 weeks, or a confirmed complete or partial overall 
response), TTP, duration of response and OS.  
Eligible  patients  were  ≥  18  years  of  age  with  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  NSCLC,  with 
evidence of inoperable local recurrence or metastasis and no other malignancy. Patients had to have at 
least one measurable lesion, adequate hematologic levels and hepatic/renal function, baseline ECOG PS 
of 0 or 1, and expected survival of > 12 weeks. No prior therapy for metastatic disease was permitted. 
Patients were excluded if they had active brain metastasis; prior brain metastasis was permitted if the 
patient was in complete remission for ≥ 1 month after treatment. First patient was enrolled on 01 March 
2004 and the study was completed on 10 June 2005. 
Abraxane was used at a dose of 260 mg/m2 administered IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks without 
steroid premedication. Patients were allowed to continue treatment in the absence of disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. 
Patients were evaluated for response on Day 15 of every third cycle per the RECIST guidelines. Patients 
who achieved a response or had SD for ≥ 16 weeks were re-evaluated 4 weeks later to confirm their 
clinical response. Survival was assessed on a monthly basis  for 6 months after study completion and 
every 3 months thereafter for 18 months (total of 2 years). 
Results 
The  investigator-determined  ORR  (proportion  of  patients  with  confirmed  complete  or  partial  overall 
response) in study CA018 was 16% (95% CI=5.2, 27.3). 
Median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI=3.9, 6.5 months) and median OS was 11.1 months (95% CI=9.5 
months, upper bound not reached). Median TTP was 6.0 months and the probability of surviving 1 year 
was 42%.  The proportion of patients who achieved controlled disease was 49% (95% CI=33.9, 63.8).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  indication  applied  for  concerns  use  of  Abraxane  in  combination  with  carboplatin  for  first-line 
treatment  of  patients  with  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  who  are  not  candidates  for  potentially  curative 
surgery and/or radiation therapy. This variation was supported by one pivotal study CA031 and three 
supportive Phase II trials. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  dose-finding  study  CA028  investigated  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  different  dose  levels  and 
administration regimens of Abraxane. The study indicated that a weekly regimen of Abraxane 100 mg/m2 
seemed appropriate when taking both the efficacy and safety data from the study into consideration. 
However, study CA028 did not investigate dosing regimens and schedules of Taxol and Abraxane which 
would result in comparable levels of biological active paclitaxel in the tumour, taking into account the 
expected mechanistic differences in paclitaxel uptake due to formulation. Thus, it cannot be excluded that 
the reported better ORR with Abraxane (see efficacy data and additional analysis below) is caused by 
differences in dosing schedule and not differences in formulation of paclitaxel. 
In the comparator arm of study CA031, Taxol was given once every 3 weeks at a dose of 200 mg/m2 
which is higher than the 175 mg/m2 dose once every 3 weeks used in combination with cisplatin, which is 
the  recommended  treatment  regimen  for  Taxol  in  the  treatment  of  NSCLC.    In  addition,  Taxol  was 
combined  with  carboplatin  instead  of  cisplatin,  which  is  the  recommended  combination  for  NSCLC 
treatment in Europe. However, this dose has been used in some countries already in the EU and in various 
clinical trials and can be considered acceptable as a reference dose.

In response to a CHMP request to further discuss the efficacy and safety of the comparator versus the 
Taxol/cisplatin regimen as used in the EU, the MAH compared the efficacy of Abraxane/carboplatin with 
historical data of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin. The efficacy results of 3 published studies in which 
paclitaxel/cisplatin  was  used  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC  were  submitted.  Despite  the 
limitations  of  the  differences  between  the  methods  for  assessing  radiological  response,  all  studies 
reported  meaningful  ORR  outcomes  in  the  intent-to-treat  population.  The  PFS  and  OS  for 
Abraxane/carboplatin  in  Study  CA031  were  numerically  better  compared  with  paclitaxel  (175 
mg/m2)/cisplatin in the other three studies. 
Although no firm conclusion can be drawn from cross study comparisons, the comparison with historical 
data suggests that the efficacy of the Abraxane/carboplatin combination is comparable with the efficacy 
results for the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination. 
In general the baseline characteristics are reasonably balanced between the treatment groups. 
The eligibility for study CA031 was not restricted to a specific histologic subtype or to specific molecular 
characteristics of the tumour. The study was initiated in 2005. At that time treatment was not based on 
histology or molecular targets. 
As the study was open-label, the sample size re-assessment was unblinded, which is discouraged 
(reflection paper on adaptive design, CHMP/EWP/2459/02) because an increase of the sample size would 
give information of the magnitude treatment effect at time of the interim analysis. This knowledge could 
have biased end-of-trial results (e.g. because investigators alter their recruitment based on knowledge of 
the interim analysis treatment effect). However, it appears that the patient enrolment had been 
completed before the interim analysis. Therefore, it is not expected that the results of the interim analysis 
have introduced a bias regarding patient selection. The provided baseline characteristics of the cohorts of 
patients that were included in the interim analysis (n=404) and not (n=648) [data not shown], showed 
that in general, the baseline characteristic and cancer history, were similar between both cohorts of 
patients. 
OS or alternatively PFS are preferred as primary endpoint for oncologic agents instead of ORR. However, 
as this is a study with paclitaxel, - of which its activity in treatment of patients with NSCLC is an 
acknowledged option- the ORR as primary endpoint can be accepted when results of  PFS and OS as 
important secondary endpoints, are in line with the ORR results. 
The efficacy endpoints the ORR, PFS and OS, showed comparable improvements between the two cohorts 
of patients. 
Overall, the efficacy analysis showed similar results between the cohorts. Therefore, it seems plausible 
that no selection or information bias has been introduced by the interim analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The proportion of patients with a confirmed complete or partial overall response per blinded radiology 
assessment,  was  significantly  higher  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  regimen  relative  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin regime (33% versus 25%, p=0,005; response rate ration [p A/p T]=1.313). 
In general the treatment effect in the Abraxane/carboplatin on ORR was consistent. With the exception of 
patients aged ≥ 75 years or patients with primary Stage I tumours or adenocarcinomas, all subgroups 
response rate ratios were in favour of Abraxane/carboplatin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 47/69 
 
  
  
 
 
For the Abraxane/carboplatin arm the median PFS was 6.3 months (95% CI=5.6, 7.0 months), while for 
the Taxol/carboplatin arm the median PFS was 5.8 months (95% CI=5.6, 6.7 months). The HR A/T= was 
0.92  (95.1%  CI=0.767,  1.060).  The  PFS  difference  between  the  arms  was  not  statistical  significant 
(p=0.214).  The  median  OS  for  patients  treated  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  was  12.1  months  and  for 
Taxol/carboplatin  11.2  months.    The  HRA/T=  was  0.92  (95.1%  CI=0.797,  1.066).  The  OS  difference 
between the arms was not statistically significant (p=0.271).  
The study was set up as superiority study for the ORR response, and effectively a switch from superiority 
to  non-inferiority  was  made  for  PFS  and  OS  and  non-inferiority  analyses  were  conducted.  The 
non-inferiority  margin  was  set  after  the  interim  analyses,  but  before  the  final  analyses.  Based  on 
methodological and clinical grounds, the applicant considered that the 15% margin was justifiable for this 
study. However, the non-inferiority margin has external validity as these margins were also applied in 
previous procedures. It was concluded that for both PFS and OS, non-inferiority of Abraxane/carboplatin 
compared with Taxol/carboplatin was determined as the upper bounds of the 95% CIs of the HR A/T were 
<1.176. The point estimates for the medians for PFS and OS are higher in the experimental group than in 
the control arm, supporting non-inferiority. The PFS results following the non-inferiority analysis based on 
EMA  methodological  considerations  for  PFS  were  6.8  months  (95%  CI=5.7,  7.7  months)  for  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm versus 6.5 months (95% CI=5.7, 6.9 months) for the Taxol/carboplatin arm. 
The HR A/T= was 0.949 (95% CI=0.830, 1.086). 
A  high  percentage  (43%  and  41%  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  and  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm, 
respectively) of patients in the PFS analysis of the blinded reviewer was censored. Most patients were 
censored due to scanning discontinuation per PD by Investigator. Also a high percentage of patients were 
censored  for  the  OS  analysis  (31%  and  28% of  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  and  Taxol/carboplatin  arm, 
respectively). The percentage of patients who were censored due to completion of 18 months follow-up 
time is comparable for the two treatment arms and will not influence the median OS results. 
The applicant has performed analyses of interaction of prognostic factors with treatment effect. For ORR 
(determined by the blinded radiology assessment) two prognostic factors showed a significant interaction 
(defined as p ≤ 0.10 in the SAP) based on a logistic regression model:  Time interval from primary 
diagnosis to randomization, and histology. 
For patients with ≥3 months since primary diagnosis, the response rate was highest in the Abraxane arm. 
An exploratory PFS analysis showed that the results in both arms seem more favourable the longer the 
time since primary diagnosis, and seem most favourable in the Abraxane arm.   
For patients with tumours of squamous histology the response rate was found to be higher in the 
Abraxane arm than in the Taxol arm, while for patients with adenocarcinoma there was no difference 
between treatment arms. In the investigator based analyses of ORR, although a significant difference was 
found between treatment arms for patients with squamous tumour histology, there was no obvious 
difference within treatment arms according to histology. The response rates were similar and the 
confidence intervals overlapped. The difference between treatment arms in response rates in patients 
with squamous tumour histology observed in the blinded review did not result in any significant difference 
between treatment arms in terms of PFS and OS. Further to the CHMP request, the applicant has 
performed analyses of the effect of prognostic factors on ORR (complete or partial response) in patients 
with squamous cell carcinoma by independent blinded radiology review and investigator assessment 
(data not shown). The findings were overall not indicative of any clustering of prognostic factors in either 
treatment arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 48/69 
 
  
  
 
 
Most of the patients that had a complete or partial response obtained this response during the first 6 
cycles of treatment. Thus in terms of ORR, there seems to be little to gain by treating the patients for 
more than 6 cycles. However additional analyses of PFS and OS in responders treated for ≤ 6 cycles and 
> 6 cycles indicate that median PFS and OS are longer for patients receiving > 6 cycles of therapy of 
ABI-007/carboplatin. The same holds true for patients receiving therapy with Taxol/carboplatin. Since 
there were no indications of increased frequency of AEs of myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and 
myalgia or arthralgia in patients receiving > 6 cycles of therapy compared to those receiving ≤ 6 cycles, 
or increased frequencies of Grade 3 or 4 AEs of the same categories (see clinical safety) it seems justified 
that treatment may continue beyond 6 cycles. 
When OS was analysed per region, a statistically significant difference between treatment arms was only 
found in the region of North-America (data not shown). This could be driven by the larger number of 
patients ≥ 70 years from North-America. An interaction was also found for age. Results of exploratory 
analyses of ORR, PFS and OS according to age (≥70 or <70) revealed a tendency in patients ≥70 years 
of prolonged PFS in the Abraxane arm and an unusual long OS.  
The results of the secondary endpoints (disease control rate, duration of response and chance in 
performance status) were comparable for both treatment arms (Abraxane/carboplatin and 
Taxol/carboplatin). In addition, the subgroup analysis for pre-specified categories were consistent with 
the primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints. 
The issue of infusion lines flushing was raised during the last PSUR procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000778/PSUV/0066 adopted by PRAC on 11 September 2014) further to a potential signal of 
medication error resulting in a lack of efficacy (substantial amount of product remaining in the infusion 
line). Given the small volume of Abraxane being administered, the potential impact of not flushing the 
infusion line on the administered dose was considered important. In a subsequent procedure (LEG 29 
adopted by PRAC on 4 December 2014), the PRAC noted that the current wording in the Abraxane SmPC 
does not inform on flushing the line in order to ensure delivering of the full dose. Furthermore, the PRAC 
considered that additional information should be gathered from re-analysing data from registration 
studies, from the provision of stability data of Abraxane with commonly used diluents and calculations on 
the amounts of Abraxane lost if flushing is not performed. The MAH committed to submit this information 
in the next PSUR in order for the PRAC to better understand the extent and the exact nature of the issue. 
The need to introduce a statement in the PI in relation to infusion lines flushing was discussed by CHMP 
in the context of the current procedure and it was considered important to include a statement in sections 
4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC to recommend the flushing of the injection line to ensure that the correct amount 
of product is administered to patients, acknowledging that this issue will be closely followed in the next 
PSURs. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The currently provided efficacy data suggest a similar efficacy Abraxane/carboplatin combination therapy 
as for Taxol/carboplatin combination therapy for the treatment of NSCLC. Further to the review of all data 
submitted to support the dose of Abraxane and the use of Taxol/carboplatin in the comparator arm of the 
pivotal study CA031, the CHMP considers that Abraxane/carboplatin can be used as an alternative 
treatment to Taxol/cisplatin in the treatment of NSCLC, based on individual characteristic and 
preferences of patients.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety data for Abraxane in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of NSCLC are mainly 
obtained from study CA031. In study CA028 limited number (25) of patients were treated with the same 
dose of Abraxane/carboplatin as in the CA031 study. For the use of Abraxane monotherapy in the 
treatment of NSCLC patients, safety data was obtained from two clinical studies (CA015 and CA018). 
Patient exposure 
A  total  number  of  765  patients  received  Abraxane/carboplatin  therapy  during  the  studies  CA031  and 
CA028.  Of  these  patients  589  received  weekly  Abraxane  in  combination  with  q3w  carboplatin  in  the 
pivotal CA031 study and primary supportive study CA028 and 176 patients received Abraxane every 3 
weeks/carboplatin  in  study  CA028.    The  most  common  Abraxane  dose  administered  during  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin treatment was 100 mg/m2 (N=539).   
In study CA031, a median of 6.0 cycles was administered in each treatment arm. Duration of treatment 
was comparable between the treatment arms in Study CA031 and for combination therapy with Abraxane 
given weekly over every 3 weeks; i.e., approximately 75% of patients received 4 cycles; approximately 
50% of patients received 6 cycles; approximately 10% of patients received 12 cycles.  
The median cumulative taxane dose and median average taxane dose intensity were in Study CA031, 
higher  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  (1325.0  mg/m2  and  81.98  mg/m2/week,  respectively)  relative  to 
Taxol/carboplatin (1125.0 mg/m2 and 65.12 mg/m2/week, respectively). The median percentage of the 
protocol-specified  dose  administered  and  the  proportion  of  patients  receiving  ≥90%  of  the 
protocol-specified  taxane  dose  was  lower  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  (81.98%  and  34%,  respectively) 
relative  to  Taxol/carboplatin  (97.67%  and  73%  respectively).  The  median  percentage  of 
protocol-specified carboplatin dose administered was comparable for the 2 treatment arms (99.77% and 
100.00%, respectively).  
Taxane dose reductions 
In study CA031, the proportion of patients with treatment-related AEs resulting in taxane reduction was 
higher  in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  (45%)  arm  relative  to  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  (22%). 
Treatment-related  AEs  resulting  in  dose  reduction  in  ≥5%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  arm  were 
neutropenia  (24%),  thrombocytopenia  (13%),  and  anaemia  (5%)  with  Abraxane/carboplatin.  In  the 
Taxol/carboplatin  arm  AEs  that  resulted  in  taxane  dose  reduction  were  neutropenia  (9%), 
thrombocytopenia (4%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%). Despite the overall lower incidence of 
neutropenia in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm compared to the Taxol/carboplatin arm, neutropenia more 
commonly lead to dose reductions in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm.  
There was a lower incidence of sensory neuropathy leading to dose reduction in the Abraxane/carboplatin 
arm compared to the Taxol/carboplatin arm (1% versus 6%), but a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia 
resulting in dose reductions in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm than in the Taxol/carboplatin arm.  
Dose Interruptions/Delays 
In study CA031, taxane dose delay due to treatment-related AEs were common in both treatment arms, 
and more frequent with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin (67% versus 35%). Results 
were comparable for carboplatin dose delays. Even though there was a lower incidence of neutropenia 
and grade ¾ neutropenia in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm, neutropenia resulted more commonly in dose 
interruptions or delays in that arm. The 3 treatment-related events most frequently resulting in taxane 
dose  delay  were  neutropenia  (41%),  thrombocytopenia  (30%),  and  anaemia  (14%)  with  the

Abraxane/carboplatin arm. For the Taxol/carboplatin arm the AEs most frequently resulting in dose delay 
were neutropenia (12%), thrombocytopenia (12%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5%).  
Adverse events 
Table  28:  Overview  of  Adverse  Events  during  the  NSCLC  studies  (Treated  Populations: 
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Studies; Abraxane combination and monotherapy) 
For  study  CA031  the  incidence  of  treatment  related  AE,  treatment  related  AE  grade  3  or  higher, 
treatment-related  SAEs, 
fatal  SAEs,  treatment  related  AEs  resulting 
in  permanent  taxane 
discontinuation, were comparable for patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin and for patients treated 
with Taxol/carboplatin.  
During  Abraxane/carboplatin  dosing  (CA031  and  CA028),  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were 
alopecia (54%), neutropenia (52%), and thrombocytopenia (41%) with Abraxane weekly combined with 
carboplatin.  In  study  CA031  the  treatment  related  events  that  were  reported  less  often  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  relative  to  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  were  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy, 
arthralgia,  and  myalgia.  Treatment-related  events  that  were  reported  more 
frequently 
in 
Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  than  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  included  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia, 
haemoglobin decreased, peripheral oedema and epistaxis.  
In  study  CA031,  treatment-related,  grade  3  or  higher  AEs  were  reported  in  approximately  61%  of 
patients in both treatment arms. The most frequently reported events were all hematologic toxicities in 
both  arms.;  i.e.,  neutropenia  (36%  and  40%),  anaemia  (21%)  and  thrombocytopenia  (17%)  with 
Abraxane/carboplatin; and neutropenia (40%), neutrophil count decreased (10%), and leukopenia (8%) 
with Taxol/carboplatin. Grade 3 or higher peripheral sensory neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy were 
reported less often with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin. On the other hand, grade 3 or 
higher anaemia and thrombocytopenia were reported more often with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to 
Taxol/carboplatin.  Grade 3 to 4 decreased Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) occurred less frequently with 
Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin.

Peripheral Neuropathy 
In study CA031, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy was lower after Abraxane/carboplatin treatment 
than after Taxol/carboplatin treatment (48% versus 64%, respectively). For Abraxane/carboplatin, the 
incidence of Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was 4%, while for Taxol/carboplatin it was 12%. All cases of 
treatment-related, grade 4 neuropathy were in the Taxol/carboplatin arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 52/69 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Events of peripheral neuropathy occurred earlier during treatment and generally took longer to resolve 
with  Taxol/carboplatin  in  comparison  to  Abraxane/carboplatin.  The  time  to  resolution  to  grade  1 
neuropathy, measured from the day grade 3 or higher neuropathy developed to the day it resolved to 
grade 1 or better, was 38 days with Abraxane/carboplatin and 104 days with Taxol/carboplatin.  
Anaemia 
In  the  analysis  of  anaemia  reported  as  an  AE  (by  the  investigator),  the  term  anaemia  includes 
haemoglobin  decrease,  haematocrit  decreased,  and  red  blood  cell  count  decreased.  In  study  CA031, 
anaemia events occurred more frequently with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin (54% 
versus 28%, respectively). This finding was consistent for anaemia events rated as grade 3 or higher 
(28% versus 7%). Only 4% of the events in the Abraxane/carboplatin and <1% of the events in the 
Taxol/carboplatin  arm  were  considered  SAEs.  Very  few  Abraxane/carboplatin  patients  discontinued 
treatment  (<1%)  and  a  minority  of  patients  had  their  doses  reduced  (6%)  or  delayed  (17%)  due  to 
anaemia.  
In study CA031 more patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm relative to the Taxol/carboplatin required 
anti-anaemic  medications 
(35% 
versus 
20%) 
and 
transfusions. 
Similarly,  more 
Abraxane/carboplatin-treated 
patients 
had 
a 
concomitant 
blood 
transfusion 
than 
Taxol/carboplatin-treated patients (16% versus 4%). Of the patients who received a concomitant blood 
transfusion,  the  majority  received  one  transfusion  (62%  (Abraxane/carboplatin)  and  79% 
(Taxol/carboplatin)). The median time to the first transfusion was 65 days, or at the beginning of Cycle 4 
in both arms.  
Thrombocytopenia 
The reported term thrombocytopenia includes thrombocytopenia and platelet count decrease. In study 
CA031,  thrombocytopenia  AEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  than  in  the 
Taxol/carboplatin  arm  (45%  versus  27%).  Also  grade  3  or  higher  events  were  more  frequent  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm than in the Taxol/carboplatin arm (18% versus 7%).  A higher percentage of 
patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm relative to the Taxol/carboplatin arm experienced a dose delay 
due to thrombocytopenia (34 versus 14%). There were very few thrombocytopenia SAEs (<1% in each 
treatment arm) and a minority of thrombocytopenia events led to taxane dose reductions (13% and 4%, 
respectively) or taxane discontinuations (3% and <1%, respectively).  
There was no increase in haemorrhagic AEs with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin (13% 
and 10%, respectively). The types of haemorrhagic events were similar between the arms and there were 
few  haemorrhagic  SAEs  in  either  treatment  arm.  In  addition,  the  incidence  of  haemorrhagic  events 
occurring  within  2  weeks  of  a  thrombocytopenic  event  was  low  in  both  treatment  arms  (5  patients 
(Abraxane/carboplatin) versus 1 patient (Taxol/carboplatin). 
The results of time-to-improvement by at least 1 grade of Grade 3 or 4 anaemia and thrombocytopenia 
are presented below.

Patients not experiencing improvement were censored at the last time the patient was evaluated for adverse events. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
The  overall  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  AEs  was  comparable  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  and 
Taxol/carboplatin arms (41% and 38%, respectively) of study CA031. The most common events in both 
arms were nausea (27% and 25%, respectively), constipation (16% and 13%, respectively), diarrhoea 
(15% and 11%, respectively), vomiting (12% for both arms) and stomatitis (65 and 4%, respectively). 
The incidence of grade 3 or higher events was low (≤5%) for both arms. Approximately 1% of patients in 
each treatment arm experienced a Gastrointestinal disorder SAE and 1 patient in the Taxol/carboplatin 
arm discontinued due to a gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Dose modifications due to these events were 
low in both arms.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the CA031 study the incidence and type of SAEs was comparable between the two trial arms; 93 (18%) 
patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 80 (15%) patients in the Taxol/carboplatin arm. Anaemia 
was reported as an SAE more often with Abraxane/carboplatin relative to Taxol/carboplatin (45 versus 
<1%).  The  incidence  of  all  other  SAEs  was  comparable  between  the  2  treatment  arms.  Febrile 
neutropenia was infrequently reported in both treatment arms (<1%).

least  1%  of  Patients  in  Either  treatment  Arms  (Treated  Population:  Pivotal  NSCLC  study 
CA031) 
Deaths 
SAEs with outcome of death were reported in 18 (4%) patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 19 
(4%)  patients  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm.  Events  with  outcome  of  death  is  more  than  1  patient  in 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm were pulmonary embolism, pulmonary haemorrhage, and cardiac arrest. Such 
events  reported  in  more  than  1  patient  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  were  pulmonary  embolism  and 
pulmonary haemorrhage. 
Laboratory findings 
In study CA031 there were no significant differences in the incidence of clinically significant chemistry 
values between the Abraxane/carboplatin and Taxol/carboplatin treatment arms. With the exception of 
glucose  level  changes,  clinically  significant  chemistry  values  mostly  occurred  as  isolated  events  and 
resolved to normal values.  
Clinical laboratory parameter reported as SAEs were uncommon; 1 SAE for increased AST was reported 
in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 1 SAE for increased ALT was reported in the Taxol/carboplatin arm. 
There  were  no  positive  correlating  between  the  liver  enzyme  SAEs  and  liver  metastases.    For  each 
parameter, less than 1% of patients permanently discontinued treatment or had their dose reduced due 
to a chemistry value change in either treatment arm. In addition, ≤4% of patients in either treatment arm 
experienced a dose delay due to a chemistry laboratory value shift.  
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
In  both  treatment  arms  myelosuppression,  neuropathy  events  and  arthralgia  were  more  common  in 
patients ≥ 65 compared with those < 65 years. Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were more common in patients ≥65 
years (80%) than <65 years (65%), and treatment emergent SAEs (39% vs. 17%) and TEAEs leading to 
death (6% vs. 3%) was higher in patients above 75 years than under 75 years. In addition, similar to 
what was observed in the overall  population, elderly patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm had higher

incidences of grade 3 or higher anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and lower incidences or grade 3 or higher

Gender 
Women  compared  with  men  experienced  higher  rates  of  gastrointestinal  TEAEs 
in 
the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhoea. Trends were similar 
in the Taxol/carboplatin arm with nausea, constipation, and vomiting. Women compared with men in the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm experienced higher rates of laboratory abnormalities, in particular decreased 
WBC,  haemoglobin,  and  ANC,  and  increase  ALT.  Trends  were  similar  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm. 
Women  overall  had  a  higher  incidence  of  grade  3  or  higher  leukopenia  than  men,  and  women  in  the 
Taxol/carboplatin  arm  had  higher  rates  of  grade  3  or  higher  neutropenia  than  women  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm. The difference in neutropenia rates between the treatment arms was most 
prominent in women. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Taxane discontinuation 
In study CA031, TEAEs resulting in permanent taxane discontinuation were reported in 16% of patients in 
each arm; and most of these events were treatment-related with both Abraxane/carboplatin (12%) and 
Taxol/carboplatin  (11%).  In  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  AEs  resulting  in  permanent  taxane 
discontinuation included neutropenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (3%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(1%).  In  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  AEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  taxane  treatment  included 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (4%), peripheral neuropathy 2%), and neutropenia (2%).

Risk of Anaemia with Abraxane/carboplatin Compared with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin 
In Study CA031, the term anaemia includes the MedDRA v12.1 preferred terms anaemia, haemoglobin 
decreased, haematocrit decreased, and red blood cell count decreased.  
In Study CA031, 4% of the anaemia events were serious TEAEs. Very few Abraxane/carboplatin-treated 
patients who experienced anaemia discontinued treatment (<1%), while 6% had dose reduction, and 
17% had dose delayed due to anaemia. In the Giaccone study, no patient discontinued treatment due to 
anaemia; although 7% of patients had dose reductions, and 9% had treatment delays due to hematologic 
toxicity.  No  details  on  dose  reductions  or  treatment  delays  associated  specifically  with anaemia  were 
reported.  In  the  Gatzemeier  study,  no  details  on  dose  reductions  or  treatment  delays  associated 
specifically  with  anaemia  were  reported;  5%  (10/202)  of  patients  had  a  first  dose  reduction  due  to 
hematologic toxicity and treatment delays due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 16% of courses. 
The rate of blood transfusions was similar for Abraxane/carboplatin in Study CA031 and the paclitaxel 175 
mg/m2/cisplatin arms in the Giaccone and Gatzemeier studies (16%, 13%, and 15%, respectively; CSR 
CA031 in-text Table 50; Giaccone, 1998; Gatzemeier, 2000), and higher in the Smit study (24%; Smit, 
2003).

Risk of Thrombocytopenia with Abraxane/carboplatin Compared with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin 
In Study CA031, thrombocytopenia includes the MedDRA v12.1 preferred terms thrombocytopenia and 
platelet count decreased. The incidence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (potentially to be at risk for 
bleeding) was 4% in Study CA031, 1% in the Giaccone study, and < 1% in the Gatzemeier study.  
However, the incidence of Grade 4 thrombocytopenia across these studies must be interpreted with 
caution as Study CA031 utilized Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTCAE) v3, while the prior 
studies likely utilized CTCAE v2. The change between versions moved the cut off from < 10.0 x109/L to < 
25.0 x 109/L, which may have increased the reporting of Grade 4 events in Study CA031 compared with 
the earlier paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin studies.  
Of the patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin in Study CA031 who experienced thrombocytopenia, 
30% had their doses delayed, 13% had their doses reduced and 3% discontinued treatment due to 
thrombocytopenia.  
In the Giaccone study, only one patient discontinued treatment because of unspecified hematotoxicity; 
One patient died of haemorrhage during an episode of severe thrombocytopenia after Cycle 3. Although 
7% of patients had dose reductions and 9% had treatment delays due to hematologic toxicity, no 
reported dose reductions were due to thrombocytopenia. No details were reported regarding treatment 
delays associated with thrombocytopenia.  
None of the patients in the Gatzemier study discontinued because of hematotoxicity.  No further details on 
dose reductions or treatment delays associated specifically with thrombocytopenia were reported.  
In Study CA031, among the patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm who experienced Grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia, 7% received platelet transfusions during the course of the study. In the Giaccone 
study, 13% of patients in the paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin arm received blood transfusions for 
“hematologic toxicity”; no further information is available.  
Other  Adverse  Events  of  Special  Interest  for  Abraxane/carboplatin  Compared  with  paclitaxel  (175 
mg/m2)/cisplatin 
The  incidence  of  of  nausea/vomiting,  arthralgia/myalgia,  renal  toxicity  and  hypersensitivity  reactions 
were all lower in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm in study CA031 when compared to historical safety data 
for the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
As could be expected, the safety profile for Abraxane combination therapy was worse than for Abraxane 
monotherapy,  however  the  increased  toxicity  seen  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  did  not  result  in  an 
increased number of patients for whom paclitaxel treatment was permanently discontinued, compared to 
monotherapy. 
In study CA031, both Abraxane and Taxol were combined with carboplatin, although in EU paclitaxel is 
approved in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of NSCLC.  
Further to the CHMP request to discuss the benefit compared with the Taxol/cisplatin combination, the 
MAH submitted historical data showing that the toxicity profile of the Abraxane/carboplatin combination 
is different from the toxicity profile of paclitaxel/cisplatin. This comparison indicated a higher incidence of 
anaemia  and  thrombocytopenia  for  Abraxane/carboplatin,  but  a  lower  incidence  of  neuropathy, 
nauseas/vomiting, arthralgia/myalgia, renal toxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. 
Most  of  the  reported  AEs  and  SAEs  are  already  known  AEs  of  Abraxane  and/or  carboplatin.    For  the 
treatment with Abraxane/carboplatin the most frequently reported TEAEs were alopecia, neutropenia, 
and thrombocytopenia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 60/69 
 
  
  
In  study  CA031  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  both  treatment  arms  (18%  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 15% in the Taxol/carboplatin arm). Most frequently reported SAE in both 
arms included anaemia, pneumonia, dyspnoea and pulmonary embolism.  
For patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin the incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy and grade 
3 sensory neuropathy was lower than for patients treated with Taxol/carboplatin. Events of peripheral 
neuropathy occurred earlier during treatment and generally took longer to resolve with Taxol/carboplatin 
in comparison to Abraxane/carboplatin. If Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy develops, treatment 
should be withheld until improvement to Grade 0 or 1 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent 
courses of Abraxane and carboplatin (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The decreased incidence of neuropathy, including a lower incidence of Grade 3/4 neuropathy, and a lower 
percentage  of  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  peripheral  neuropathy,  is  considered  an 
advantage of the Abraxane/carboplatin combination. 
Treatment-related  events 
that  were  reported  more 
frequently 
for  patients 
treated  with 
Abraxane/carboplatin  than  for  patients  treated  with  Taxol/carboplatin  included  thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia,  haemoglobin  decreased,  peripheral  oedema  and  epistaxis.  In  particular  the  incidence  of 
anaemia  and  thrombocytopenia  was  substantially  higher  in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  than  in  the 
Taxol/carboplatin arm (54% versus 28% and 45% versus 27%, respectively). Also, grade 3 or higher 
anaemia  and 
thrombocytopenia  was  reported  more 
frequently 
for  patients 
treated  with 
Abraxane/carboplatin  than  for  Taxol/carboplatin  (28%  versus  7%  and  18%  versus  7%  respectively). 
However, the haematological AEs are mostly manageable with dose modification (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Despite  the  overall  lower  incidence  of  neutropenia  in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  compared  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin arm, neutropenia more commonly lead to dose reductions in the Abraxane/carboplatin 
arm.  According  to  the  applicant  this  is  attributable  to  the  weekly  administration  schedule  of 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm, providing more opportunities for protocol-specified dose reductions due to 
paclitaxel-induced myelosuppression. 
The  overall  incidence  of  gastrointestinal  AEs  was  comparable  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  and 
Taxol/carboplatin arms of study CA031 (41% versus 38%, respectively).  
In the Abraxane/carboplatin arm, arthralgia (13% versus 25%) and myalgia (10% versus 19%) were 
reported less frequently. The average age at which lung cancer is diagnosed is 71 years. The median age 
in the pivotal studies was 60 years, which is considerably younger. In study CA031, Grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
more common in patients ≥65 years (80%) than <65 years (65%), and treatment emergent SAEs (39% 
vs. 17%) and TEAEs leading to death (6% vs. 3%) was higher in patients above 75 years than under 75 
years.  As  mentioned  above,  the  incidence  of  myalgia  and  arthralgia  reported  for  the  whole  study 
population was lower in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm than in the Taxol/carboplatin arm. In contrast, for 
patients  of  the  age  of  75  years  and  above,  these  AEs  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the 
Taxol/carboplatin arm than in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm. Further to the CHMP request, the applicant 
provided additional analyses to demonstrate that the reduced incidence of myalgia/arthralgia was not 
related to the relatively young patient population (60 years) [data not shown]. These analyses showed 
that although the incidence of myalgia and arthralgia reported for the whole study population was lower 
in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  than  in  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm,  these  events  were  reported  less 
frequently in the Taxol/carboplatin arm than in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm for patients of the age of 75 
years and above. The CHMP agrees with the applicant that the number of elderly (≥ 75 years of age) 
patients was very limited and no definitive conclusions can be drawn. However, the provided data do not 
support  a  specific  benefit  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  combination  in  comparison  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin combination. The limited experience for Abraxane/carboplatin use in the very elderly 
Assessment report

(18/514 patients were ≥75 years of age) has therefore been included in section 4.2 of SmPC. The safety 
profile based on age group appears to be as anticipated.  
For  Grade  2  or  3  cutaneous  toxicity,  Grade  3  diarrhoea,  or  Grade  3  mucositis,  treatment  should  be 
interrupted until the toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 1, then treatment should be restarted at a lower dose 
(see  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC).  For  any  other  Grade  3  or  4  non-haematologic  toxicity,  the  treatment 
should be interrupted until the toxicity improves to ≤ Grade 2, then treatment should be restarted at a 
lower dose (see section 4.2). 
In  study  CA031  more  patients  treated  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  than  with  Taxol/carboplatin  had  a 
treatment related AE resulting in taxane reduction (45% versus 22%, respectively). Also dose delay was 
reported more frequently for patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin than for patients treated with 
Taxol/carboplatin (67% versus 35%). Further to the CHMP request to discuss the impact of the frequently 
reported dose modifications in case of AEs on the efficacy of the Abraxane/carboplatin treatment, the 
Applicant performed analyses (data not shown) indicating a better OS for patients who did have a dose 
modification than for the patients who did not have a dose modification. However, as also stated by the 
applicant, these 2 groups were non-randomized. Therefore, the groups are possibly not comparable at 
baseline. Nevertheless, the data provide no indication of a decreased efficacy of Abraxane due to dose 
modification. 
For both treatment arms in study CA031 4% of patients had a SAE with outcome of death. Events with 
outcome deaths reported in more than 1 patient included pulmonary embolism, pulmonary haemorrhage 
and cardiac arrest. The proportion of patients with a AEs resulting in permanent taxane discontinuation 
was  similar  for  both  treatment  arms  in  study  CA031  (16%  for  both  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  and 
Taxol/carboplatin arms).  
Treatment related fatal events occurred at equally low frequencies in both the Abraxane arm (1/514) and 
in the Taxol arm (1/524) of pivotal Study CA031. Higher frequency of treatment related fatal events was 
observed  in  phase  II  Study  CA028  than  in  the  Abraxane  arm  of  pivotal  Study  CA031.  The  applicant 
indicated that the 6 of the 7 treatment-related deaths observed in Study CA028 received 3 weeks dosing 
regimens  using  a  single  dose  of  Abraxane  between  225  mg/m2  and  340  mg/m2  in  combination  with 
carboplatin and only 1 death occurred in the weekly cohort at the recommended therapeutic dose of 100 
mg/m2 in combination with carboplatin. Administration of higher doses every three weeks is more toxic 
and likely to explain the higher frequency of treatment related deaths in Study CA028 than in pivotal 
Study CA031. Risk factors for fatal events were also investigated by the Applicant (e.g. treatment arm, 
age,  sex,  stage  at  primary  diagnosis,  etc…)  however  none  of  the  explored  risk  factors  that  could 
potentially impact the chance of death by an AE appeared to be prognostic for fatal events. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the neurotoxicity for the Abraxane/carboplatin combination was lower than for the 
Taxol/carboplatin combination. On the other hand, the hematologic toxicity was higher for the 
Abraxane/carboplatin combination than for the Taxol/carboplatin combination. A decreased incidence of 
peripheral sensory neuropathy could be an important safety advantage for the Abraxane/carboplatin 
combination above the Taxol/carboplatin combination.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In  study  CA031,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  confirmed  complete  or  partial  overall  response 
according  to  the  blinded  radiology  assessment,  was  statistically  significantly  higher  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  compared  to  the  Taxol/carboplatin  arm  (33%  and  25%  respectively; 
p=0.005). 
The reported median PFS for the Abraxane/carboplatin was 6.3 months, while for the Taxol/carboplatin 
arm the median PFS was 5.8 months. The HRA/T for PFS was 0.92 (95.1% CI=0.77, 1.060).  
The PFS results following the non-inferiority analysis based on EMA methodological considerations for PFS 
were 6.8 months (95% CI=5.7, 7.7 months) for the Abraxane/carboplatin arm versus 6.5 months (95% 
CI=5.7, 6.9 months). The HRA/T= was 0.949 (95% CI=0.830, 1.086). 
The median OS for patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin was 12.1 months and for Taxol/carboplatin 
11.2 months. The HRA/T for OS was 0.92 (95.1% CI=0.797, 1.066).  
The results of the other secondary endpoints (disease control rate, duration of response and change in 
performance status) were comparable for both treatment arms. The results of ORR, OS and PFS were 
consistent for most of the pre-specified subgroups.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The dose finding study CA028 did not investigate which dosing regimen of Taxol and Abraxane would 
result in comparable levels of biological active paclitaxel in the tumour. Based on the data from study 
CA028  it  cannot  be  firmly  concluded  that  the  weekly  regimen  of  Abraxane  100  mg/m2 is  the  optimal 
regimen for comparison with Taxol 200 mg/m2 q3w in the phase III study CA031, and thus it cannot be 
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015 
Page 66/69 
 
  
  
 
excluded that the reported better ORR with Abraxane is caused by differences in dosing schedule and not 
differences in formulation of paclitaxel. 
The treatment dosage used in the comparator arm is approved in the US however in Europe, a lower dose 
of  Taxol  175  mg/m2  is  approved  and  combined  with  cisplatin.  The  efficacy  of  Abraxane/carboplatin 
compared with historical data of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2)/cisplatin do not suggest a clear or consistent 
diminished efficacy of treatment for the Abraxane/carboplatin in comparison with the paclitaxel/cisplatin 
combination,  although, it  is  acknowledged  that  no  firm  conclusion  should  be  drawn  by  comparison  of 
efficacy results obtained from different studies. 
Although  a  significant  difference  in  the  investigator  based  analyses  of  ORR  was  found  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm compared to the control arm for patients with squamous tumour histology, the 
results of the PFS subgroup analysis did not provide support for a higher efficacy of Abraxane/carboplatin 
in the squamous cell carcinoma over non-squamous cell carcinoma compared to Taxol/carboplatin (see 
SmPC section 5.1). 
The pivotal CA031 study was set up as superiority study for the ORR response, and effectively a switch 
from superiority to non-inferiority for PFS and OS was made. The non-inferiority margin was set after the 
interim  analyses,  but  before  the  final  analyses.  The  same  non-inferiority  margins  were  applied  as  in 
previous procedures for other products (Alimta, Xeloda). The rationale for the non-inferiority margin is 
considered to be sufficiently non-data-driven and the non-inferiority margin has external validity as these 
margins were also applied in previous procedures. After analyses of PFS and OS, it can be concluded that 
the Abraxane/carboplatin combination was non-inferior to the Taxol/carboplatin combination.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
For  the  treatment  with  Abraxane/carboplatin  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  alopecia, 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
For patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin peripheral sensory neuropathy, arthralgia and myalgia 
were  reported  less  frequently  than  for  patients  treated  with  Taxol/carboplatin.  Events  of  peripheral 
neuropathy occurred earlier during treatment and generally took longer to resolve with Taxol/carboplatin 
in comparison to Abraxane/carboplatin. The time to resolution to grade 1 neuropathy was shorter with 
Abraxane/carboplatin than with Taxol/carboplatin. 
Treatment  related  events  that  were  reported  more 
frequently 
for  patients  treated  with 
Abraxane/carboplatin  than  for  patients  treated  with  Taxol/carboplatin  included  thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia, haemoglobin decreased, peripheral oedema and epistaxis. For patients with Grade 3/4 anaemia 
(TEAEs) median time to improvement by at least one grade was similar in both the Abraxane/carboplatin 
arm and in the Taxol/carboplatin arm. Concerning thrombocytopenia, Grade 3/4 (TEAEs) median time to 
improvement  by  at  least  one  grade  was  shorter  in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  arm  than  in  the 
Taxol/carboplatin arm. 
In  study  CA031  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  both  treatment  arms  (18%  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm and 15% in the Taxol/carboplatin arm). Most frequently reported SAEs in both 
arms included anaemia, pneumonia, dyspnoea and pulmonary embolism. 
In study CA031 more patients treated with Abraxane/carboplatin had a treatment related AE resulting in 
taxane reduction than with Taxol/carboplatin.  Also dose delay was reported more frequently for patients 
treated with Abraxane/carboplatin than for patients treated with Taxol/carboplatin.  
Assessment report  
EMA/76768/2015

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Both Abraxane and Taxol were combined with carboplatin, whereas in the EU, paclitaxel/cisplatin is the 
approved  combination  for  the  treatment  of  NSCLC.  The  use  of  cisplatin  is  associated  with  less 
haematological site effects hampering the comparison.  The same applies to the dose of Taxol of 200 
mg/m2 used as comparator. This may have favourably influenced the comparison with Abraxane in terms 
of myelosuppression and neuropathy as in Europe, a lower dose of paclitaxel is approved (175 mg/m2). 
The comparison of the safety results obtained in study CA031 with the safety profile of paclitaxel (175 
mg/m2)/cisplatin  as  published  in  three  different  clinical  trials  showed  that  the  safety  profile  of  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin  combination  and  paclitaxel/cisplatin  are  different,  with  a  higher  incidence  of 
anaemia  and 
thrombocytopenia  but  a 
lower 
incidence  of  neuropathy,  nausea/vomiting, 
arthralgia/myalgia,  renal  toxicity  and  hypersensitivity  reactions 
in  the  Abraxane/carboplatin 
combination. 
Higher frequency of treatment-related fatal events was observed in phase II Study CA028 than in the 
Abraxane arm of the pivotal Study CA031. However patients in study CA028 received higher doses of 
Abraxane, which likely explains the higher frequency of treatment related deaths in this study.  
The  incidence  of  myalgia  and  arthralgia  reported  for  the  whole  study  population  was  lower  in  the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm than in the Taxol/carboplatin arm, these events were reported less frequently 
in the Taxol/carboplatin arm than in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm for patients of the age of 75 years and 
above.  Since  the  number  of  elderly  (≥  75  years  of  age)  patients  was  very  limited,  no  definitive 
conclusions can be drawn. In general, the safety profile based on age groups appears to be as anticipated 
with  no  particular  findings.  However  the  limited  experience  for  Abraxane/carboplatin  use  in  the  very 
elderly (≥75 years of age) has therefore been included in section 4.2 of SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy results of study CA031 suggest a similar efficacy for the Abraxane/carboplatin combination 
as for the Taxol/carboplatin combination in patients with NSCLC. The comparator arm is not an approved 
therapy  in  Europe  where  a  lower  dose  of  Taxol  (paclitaxel,  175  mg/m2  instead  of  200  mg/m2)  with 
cisplatin  is  approved.  However,  this  dose  has  been  used  in  some  countries  already  in  the  EU  and  in 
various clinical trials and can be considered acceptable as a reference dose. 
The relevance of improved ORR with Abraxane compared to Taxol without significantly improved PFS and 
OS is unclear, but there is no indication that the Abraxane/carboplatin regimen is less effective in terms 
of  PFS  and  OS  compared  to  the  Taxol/carboplatin  regimen  used  in  study  CA031.  Carboplatin  is  a 
frequently used alternative to cisplatin in combination with paclitaxel as first-line treatment of NSCLC. 
Abraxane in combination with carboplatin may therefore be an alternative to the combination of Taxol/ 
carboplatin that has been used in some countries already in the EU and in various clinical trials  . 
The safety profile seen in study CA031 for the Abraxane/carboplatin combination was different from that 
of the Taxol/carboplatin combination, with a decreased neurotoxicity and increased haematologic toxicity 
for the Abraxane/carboplatin. A reduced incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy in particular grade 3 
or  higher  could  be  an  advantage  for  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  combination  compared  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin combination. 
The reported increased haematologic toxicity for the Abraxane/carboplatin combination in comparison to 
Taxol/carboplatin,  can  be  easily  managed  with  dose  reductions  and  supportive  care  when  the  bone 
marrow status during treatment is closely monitored (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4).

Benefit-risk balance 
In  terms  of  efficacy,  the  Abraxane/carboplatin  regimen  appears  to  be  a  valuable  alternative  to  the 
Taxol/carboplatin  regimen  that  is  considered  an  acceptable  comparator.  Abraxane  and  Taxol  have 
different toxicity profiles which may be considered to favour Abraxane. Although the patient has to be 
treated on a weekly basis with Abraxane, it has the advantage of shorter infusion time and less need for 
pre-medication. The benefit-risk balance is therefore considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Study CA031 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Abraxane arm for the primary 
endpoint of ORR based on blinded radiological review, but this is not supported by statistically significant 
improvements in PFS and OS. Switching from superiority to non-inferiority was not prospectively included 
in the study design and the delta margin was defined after inspection of the interim data for PFS and OS. 
The  approach  taken  by  the  applicant  to  show  non-inferiority  is  thus  considered  disputable,  and  the 
strength of the evidence of non-inferiority may be questioned. However, even without considering the 
questionable non-inferiority results there is no evidence in terms of PFS and OS that Abraxane 100 mg/m2 
administered weekly is less effective than Taxol administered every 3 weeks. Compared to the primary 
analysis of PFS, the non-inferiority analysis indicated even smaller differences between the treatment 
arms with fewer patients censored in this analysis (based on censoring rules from the EMA guideline). 
From a regulatory point of view the non-inferiority analysis seems to be the most robust analysis of PFS. 
The toxicity profile of the Abraxane/carboplatin is different from the toxicity profile of the 
Taxol/carboplatin or Taxol/cisplatin. However the levels of AEs were equal, indicating that patients in the 
Abraxane arm did not experience more toxicity. The approval of the Abraxane/carboplatin combination 
represents an additional treatment option for first line treatment of patients with NSCLC who are not 
candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. 
4.  Recommendations 
Final Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
Type II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of Indication to add a new indication for Abraxane in combination with carboplatin for the 
first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adult patients who are not candidates for 
potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. Consequently sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 
5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. Further, sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated with 
a recommendation to flush the intravenous line with sodium chloride to ensure administration of the 
complete dose. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Further, an updated RMP version 14.0 
was agreed during the procedure. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC and Package Leaflet.

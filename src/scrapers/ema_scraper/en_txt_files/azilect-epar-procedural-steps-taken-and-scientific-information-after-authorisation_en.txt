melanoma associated with the use of rasagiline 
mesylate in patients with Parkinson’s disease (as 
assessed and concluded in procedure WS/1749

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of the final report from study TV1030-
CNS-50024 listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. 
This is a non-interventional retrospective cohort 
study which was conducted using the United States 
Medicare research database to assess the potential 
risk of melanoma associated with the use of 
a retrospective cohort study which suggested a possibly 
increased risk of melanoma with the use of rasagiline, 
especially in patients with longer duration of rasagiline 
exposure and/or with the higher (1mg) dose of rasagiline. 
Any suspicious skin lesion should be evaluated by a 
specialist. Patients should therefore be advised to seek 
immediate medical review if a new or changing skin lesion 
is identified.

Update of sections 4.4, 4.7 and 4.8 to include a new

overdose of rasagiline based on a CCDS update. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
version 2.0 has also been submitted. In addition, the 
Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to

attacks, somnolence, sudden onset of sleep) can occur in 
patients treated with dopamine agonists and/or other 
dopaminergic treatments. A similar pattern of excessive 
daily sleepiness has been reported post-marketing with 
rasagiline. Although many of these patients reported 
somnolence while on rasagiline with other dopaminergic 
medicinal products, some perceived that they had no 
warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed 
that they were alert immediately prior to the event. Some 
of these events have been reported more than 1-year after 
initiation of treatment. In patients experiencing 
somnolence/sudden sleep episodes, rasagiline may have 
major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous 
machines, including motor vehicles, until they are 
reasonably certain that rasagiline does not affect them

must be informed to refrain from driving or engaging in 
activities where impaired alertness may put themselves or 
others at risk of serious injury or death (e.g. operating 
machines) until they have gained sufficient experience with 
rasagiline and other dopaminergic medications to gauge 
whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor 
performance adversely. In addition as the term ‘dysphoria’ 
can be attributed to cognitive effects of serotonin 
syndrome, it was removed from the list of symptoms 
reported following overdose of rasagiline in doses ranging 
from 3 mg to 100 mg.

With this procedure the MAH also updated the product 
information. This update was based on the requirements in 
the QRD guidelines and on the results of a readability test 
performed earlier by the MAH. Changes to the PI also 
derived from the MAH change of database for tracking of 
adverse events. In detail this meant that some adverse 
event terms were removed and that the incidence rate for 
some terms was updated.

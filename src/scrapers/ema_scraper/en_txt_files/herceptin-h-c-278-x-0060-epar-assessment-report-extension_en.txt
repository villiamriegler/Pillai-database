2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Herceptin  contains  the  active  substance  trastuzumab,  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody 
which  targets  the  extracellular  domain  of  the  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2  (HER2),  a 
trans-membrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. It was first approved in the EU on 
28 August 2000 for metastatic breast cancer as a powder for solution for IV infusion in the strength of 
150 mg and after subsequent extensions of the indication it is currently indicated for: 
• 
Early breast cancer (EBC) as neoadjuvant-adjuvant therapy (in combination with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, followed by trastuzumab monotherapy for a total duration of 1 year); in 
combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin; following 
adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with paclitaxel or 
docetaxel, or following surgery, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if 
applicable. 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 9/70 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or an 
aromatase inhibitor. 
•  Metastatic gastric cancer in combination with chemotherapy.   
To date, trastuzumab is approved in over 120 countries globally and is the current standard of care for 
patients with HER2-postive breast cancer. IV administration is initiated as a loading dose is given over 
90 minutes, and if well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be given over 30 minutes. 
This is a line-extension application for a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of trastuzumab presented in a 
vial and administered as a fixed dose for 3-weekly (q3w) administration via a syringe. Trastuzumab SC 
is  intended  to  be  made  available  as  an  alternative  to  the  currently  licensed  trastuzumab  intravenous 
injection  (trastuzumab  IV)  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  HER2  positive  EBC  and  MBC.  The  SC 
administration of trastuzumab is enabled by the use of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), 
a key excipient in the trastuzumab SC formulation which acts as a permeation enhancer.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Herceptin is currently presented as a powder to be reconstituted with water for injection and added to 
an infusion bag containing sodium chloride. The MAH has developed a subcutaneous formulation 
containing recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) as a permeation enhancer which facilitates 
subcutaneous delivery. The objective of Herceptin solution for injection (Herceptin SC) formulation 
development programme was to obtain a stable high concentrated liquid formulation for subcutaneous 
administration of trastuzumab. 
The formulation consists of 120 mg/mL trastuzumab in L-histidine/histidine hydrochloride buffer, 
trehalose dihydrate, methionine, rHuPH20, and polysorbate 20. rHuPH20 is a recombinant human 
hyaluronidase which enables the subcutaneous injection of large volumes. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 antibody that contains human framework regions with 
complement-determining regions of a murine antibody that binds to the human epidermal growth 
factor 2 (HER2). Trastuzumab used for the subcutaneous (SC) formulation has the same 
physicochemical, biological and immunological properties and is of the same quality as trastuzumab 
used for the intravenous (IV) formulation.  
Manufacture 
The production process of trastuzumab SC (v1.1 SC) used to manufacture Herceptin SC is identical to 
the approved process of trastuzumab (v1.1) used to manufacture Herceptin for intravenous (IV) 
administration except for the modification to the final tangential flow filtration (TFF) and adjustment in 
the buffer.  
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final tangential flow filtration (TFF) has been modified to accommodate the new Herceptin SC 
formulation and obtain a final protein concentration of 120 mg/mL for active substance (AS). In 
addition, the conditioning of active substance has been adjusted to reach a satisfactory stability of 
trastuzumab in the liquid formulation. Methionine is added and concentration of histidine, polysorbate 
20 and trehalose was adapted. 
As a consequence of the high protein concentration and small volumes, the conditioning buffer is 
prepared in single-use bags and the AS is filled into bottles and/or single-use bags. 
The purification process consists of three chromatography steps and additional steps for removal, 
inactivation of potential viral contaminants and concentration/ diafiltration steps.  
The applicant presented data from 5 runs to demonstrate process validation for SC trastuzumab which 
demonstrated that the existing fermentation and purification process is capable of producing 
trastuzumab of constant quality. 
The dossier contains adequate detailed information on the manufacturing steps, operating conditions 
and media/solutions used. Regarding the MCB and WCB, these remain the same as for the 
trastuzumab v1.1 IV presentation. Adequate information on the derivation the cell banks, identity and 
safety testing is provided in the dossier. The MCB/WCB and end of production (EoP) cells have been 
characterised and appropriate information was also provided on the media and solutions used.  
Specification 
The proposed specification for trastuzumab v1.1 SC is developed on basis of the AS specification of the 
approved trastuzumab v1.1 process to ensure the same product quality of trastuzumab v1.1 SC and 
trastuzumab v1.1 AS. The specification for AS has been suitably justified and is supported by 
consistent data from multiple lots. The specification contains tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well 
as specific methods to ensure safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, quantity, potency.  
Analytical methods are detailed in the dossier and remain the same as for the IV trastuzumab. The 
non-compendial methods were revalidated for performance in amended buffer and also, in the case of 
FP, for interference with rHuPH20. 
Stability 
Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life of the active substance of 36 months when stored 
at -70°C and 1 month at + 4°C in either container (single-use bottles and single-use bags) is 
considered acceptable. Both containers have been qualified for levels of extractables over longer term 
storage.   
A comparison of stress stability data at +25°C and +35°C of trastuzumab v1.1 SC and trastuzumab 
v1.1 material indicate comparable degradation pathways of the trastuzumab molecule. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The applicant outlines the main changes between trastuzumab active substance IV and SC, and 
between trastuzumab manufactured earlier in the process and later.   
The potential impact of the implemented changes in the manufacturing process on the quality of 
trastuzumab v1.1 SC is addressed by comprehensive comparability studies.  
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 11/70 
  
 
 
 
 
The applicant has comprehensively studied the quality of trastuzumab across the processes using a 
combination of physicochemical, biological and impurity tests.  Results support the comparability 
between material derived from each of the processes.   
The data provided indicate that the trastuzumab v1.1 SC process is comparable to the trastuzumab 
v1.1 and trastuzumab v1.0 SC process. The implemented changes in the manufacturing process have 
no impact to the trastuzumab v1.1 SC purification process.  
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
The finished product formulation consists of 120 mg/mL trastuzumab in L-histidine/histidine 
hydrochloride buffer, trehalose dihydrate, methionine, rHuPH20, and polysorbate 20. rHuPH20 is a 
recombinant human hyaluronidase which allows the subcutaneous injection of large volumes. rHuPH20 
is considered a novel excipient. 
Herceptin solution for injection (Herceptin SC) finished product is a sterile, colorless to yellowish, clear 
to opalescent liquid solution (120 mg/mL) for subcutaneous use supplied in 6 mL single-use vials.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The formulation of the finished product for this SC presentation differs to that of the IV product as 
methionine and recombinant hyaluronidase (rHUPH20) are additionally included and the formulation is 
presented as a solution for injection  rather than a lyophilisate. 
Data from characterisation studies demonstrated that the presence of rHuPH20 in Herceptin SC 
formulation has no impact on trastuzumab quality. 
Release data for all lots demonstrate a consistent quality of trastuzumab between batches and no 
significant differences between Herceptin SC manufactured from earlier and later lots is verified. 
The available data supports the conclusion that Herceptin SC clinical and commercial material is 
comparable at release and upon storage.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing trastuzumab and hyaluronidase, mixing and sterile 
filtration and filling. Pooling of thawed trastuzumab bulks from multiple active substance storage 
containers is performed into a sterilized mixing/compounding vessel in order to yield the required 
batch size for the fill process. Subsequently to the transfer in the mixing/compounding vessel, the 
trastuzumab bulk solution is homogenized by stirring. The rHuPH20 solution is slowly poured into the 
compounding vessel to the trastuzumab bulk solution and mixed further to obtain a homogenized 
formulated Herceptin SC finished product bulk solution. 
Following bioburden reduction filtration, the formulated Herceptin SC bulk solution is transferred into a 
steam sterilized receiving/transport vessel. The bioburden reduction filtration is performed with steam 
sterilized membrane filters. The resulting filtered finished product bulk solution is submitted to the final 
sterile filtration prior to filling into vials.  
The MAH has run three process validation batches at the proposed commercial finished product facility. 
Finished product process development and validation studies have demonstrated that the finished 
product manufacturing process is robust.  
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 12/70 
 
 
 
 
Product specification 
Appropriate Herceptin SC release and end of shelf-life specifications have been developed based on the 
knowledge gained from preclinical development, clinical development and Herceptin for IV 
administration. The specifications contain tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific 
methods.  
Stability of the product 
The primary packaging materials used for the manufacture of Herceptin for SC injection finished 
product, 600 mg/5 mL solution, consist of a 6 mL colorless USP/Ph. Eur./JP Type I glass vial, sealed 
with a rubber stopper, and crimped with an aluminum overseal fitted with a flip-off disk. Details and 
specifications for the vial, stoppers and seals are provided and are satisfactory. 
Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months for the finished product when stored 
at 2-8°C, protected from light is considered acceptable. A maximum of 6 hours exposure at ambient 
temperature during in-use can also be accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
The existing virus clearance data for trastuzumab v1.1 IV remains valid for trastuzumab v1.1 SC 
subcutaneous administration. The data was not re-assessed within this procedure. 
Novel excipient (rHuPH20) 
The rHuPH20 degrades hyaluronan under physiological conditions and acts as a spreading factor in 
vivo. Thus, when combined or co-formulated with certain injectable drugs, rHuPH20 facilitates the 
absorption and dispersion of these drugs by temporarily clearing a path through the connective tissue 
in the subcutaneous space.  
Recombinant human hyaluronidase is a glycosylated single chain protein with up to 447 amino acids.  
Manufacture 
Overall, description of the upstream (cell expansion and main fermentation) and downstream process 
(solvent/detergent, four column purifications, nanofiltration and filling) is given and IPCs stated. The 
steps, control parameters, test methods used for control, and acceptance criteria are indicated. 
Detailed information about inoculum expansion, bioreactor operation and harvesting processes and the 
respective in-process controls are provided. Description of the single steps of the purification process is 
given. Respective maximum hold times are defined. Information about buffer volumes, flow rates, in 
process controls, maximum target mass, and collection mode is sufficient. The acceptance criteria for 
in-process controls are considered acceptable. Lists for the major equipment used during purification, 
chemical composition, sterilization method and equipment are provided. All equipment except for the 
viral inactivation tank and chromatography columns is single use. Each step in the filling, storage, and 
shipping steps is described adequately, along with in-process controls and tests that are monitored.  
The specifications for the raw materials used for the fermentation, purification, and the bulk 
formulation process are provided. Description of the generation of the host cell line and the cell 
banking system is in line with the demands of the ICH guidelines Q5B, Q5D and CHMP 3AB1A. Critical

parameters were defined based on the ICH Q7A definition of a process step, process condition, test 
requirement, or other relevant parameter or item that must be controlled within pre-determined 
criteria (operating range) to ensure that the rHuPH20 meets its specification. The critical controls and 
the numerical limits are considered acceptable.  
The process validation protocol was developed based upon the expectation as defined by the “Guidance 
for Industry: Process Validation”. The rHuPH20 lots were manufactured under Good Manufacturing 
Practices.  
The process was validated at full commercial scale with a five batch campaign. All five consecutive runs 
met the requirements for conformance with regard to run-to-run process performance and product 
quality attributes, as defined in the process qualification (PQ) protocol. The data confirmed that the 
process is robust and in a state of control.  Information concerning general properties of the IMP, 
Manufacturing Process, Process Controls and specifications are in agreement with the demands of the 
guideline ICH Q6B. 
The  current  manufacturing  process  of  rHuPH20  was  developed  using  an  amplified  cell  line.  The 
generation  of  the  host  cell  line  and  the  cell  banking  system  is  described  in  satisfactory  detail. 
Comprehensive information on the cloning and establishment of the MCB and WCB has been provided. 
The  MAH  has  adequately  characterised  the  MCB,  WCB  and  EoP  cells  for  phenotype,  genotype  and 
safety.  The  applicant  has  also  calculated  the  total  number  of  generation  required  between  MCB  and 
EoP cells and shown that this is within the in vitro cell age as calculated in small scale stability studies 
with extended MCB passaging. 
Detailed biophysical and biochemical characterization of seven HUB batches using state-of-the-art 
methods is provided.  
Impurities present in rHuPH20 purified bulk may result from product related impurities, process related 
impurities or microbiological impurities. Process related impurities are eliminated throughout the 
manufacturing process to an acceptable low level. 
Specification 
The specification for hyaluronidase has been suitably justified and is supported by consistent data from 
multiple lots. The specification contains tests for pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific methods 
to ensure safety and quality with respect to identity, purity, quantity, potency.  
The proposed specification for rHuPH20 is considered adequate to confirm the high quality of the 
excipient. Validation of analytical procedures used for the release or stability of rHuPH20 was 
performed in accordance with the principles outlined in ICH Q2 (R1).  
Stability 
The description of the container closure system for hyaluronidase is considered appropriate. 
The stability testing is conducted in line with the recommendations of the ICH Guideline Q5C. These 
data support the shelf-life at the recommended storage for the rHuPH20 at -80 °C up to 30 months. 
Adventitious agents 
The parental CHO cell line and the cell banks (MCB, WCB, and EOP) were all generated using synthetic 
media and there are no materials of animal origin used in the process. In addition, the media used to 
propagate the cell banks did not contain bovine serum albumin or trypsin. It is noted that the Insulin

used is produced on yeast. In its manufacture, bovine materials are used. The supplier provided a 
declaration that they comply with the TSE requirements in the EU. 
Five process steps were identified as virus clearance steps and were scaled-down and evaluated. 
Results of virus removal studies demonstrated that the additive effect of different steps give good 
assurance of virus clearance ability. 
On the viral distribution, and carryover studies the applicant presented data which demonstrated that 
for both new and aged resins, that virus distribution and carry over seem consistent. The viral 
clearance study was used to assess the viral inactivation/removal for selected chromatography steps at 
highest protein load capacities (worst case). The virus log reduction values (LRVs) were comparable 
between the maximum compared to the typical load conditions, except the Xenotropic Murine 
Leukemia Virus (X-MuLV) removal by a column. The MAH states that the inequality of the mass 
balance data is partially due to inactivation during washes; however, this has not been demonstrated 
directly. The CHMP recommended conducting additional viral inactivation studies to determine the 
mechanism of action of X-MuLV inactivation during the respective chromatography used in the 
manufacture of rHuPH20 to fully validate the inactivation process. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the new pharmaceutical form (solution for 
injection); new route of administration (subcutaneous use) and new strength (600mg/5ml) of 
Herceptin SC has been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
The manufacturing process is overall, well described. The in-process control (IPC) tests are described 
and deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the manufacturing process. 
Appropriate general information about the novel excipient rHuPH20 has been provided. The potency 
assay is adapted from the USP method for activity. The differences between the in-house method and 
the USP assay are stated and are acceptable. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the applicant 
evaluates ways to improve the current hyaluronidase bioassay procedure to increase assay precision or 
investigates alternate potency assays which have less variability. 
Based on the submitted information the HCP assay cannot be regarded as fully validated. However, 
any potential risk from the rHuPH20 is conceivably small due to the small quantities of in the final FP. 
Nevertheless, the MAH is recommended to quantitatively validate that the current HCP assay reliably 
measures CHO proteins present in the rHuPH20. Should this validation reveal that the generic current 
test is not capable of this, a process specific test should be developed. 
Results from the adventitious agents safety evaluation studies demonstrated that the mass balance 
data for X-MuLV on a chromatographic column does not agree and spiked virus was not recovered. The 
applicant is recommended to conduct studies to determine the mechanism of action of X-MuLV 
inactivation during chromatography used in the manufacture of rHuPH20 to fully validate the 
inactivation process.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Based on the submitted data, the application for Herceptin SC is recommended for approval based on 
quality grounds.  
Herceptin

Overall, information on manufacture and control of the active substance, finished product and novel 
excipient (rHuPH20) has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics. A list of 
recommended measures will ensure an adequate maintenance of the quality of the product. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. The CHMP recommends that the applicant evaluates ways to improve the current hyaluronidase 
bioassay procedure to increase assay precision or investigates alternate potency assays which have 
less variability. 
2. The applicant is recommended to quantitatively validate that the current HCP assay is capable of 
detecting the majority of HCP present in the rHuPH20. Should this validation reveal that the current 
method is not capable of this, a process specific method should be developed. 
3. The CHMP recommends conducting studies to determine the mechanism of action of X-MuLV 
inactivation during chromatography used in the manufacture of rHuPH20 to fully validate the 
inactivation process. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
rHuPH20  is  a  transiently  active,  locally-acting  permeation  enhancing  enzyme  that  allows  for  the 
subcutaneous  delivery  of  therapeutics  that  have  been  traditionally  delivered  intravenously.  The  mode 
of  action  of  the  rHuPH20  is  to  locally  depolymerize the  substrate,  hyaluronan  (or  hyaluronic  acid),  at 
the  site  of  injection  in  the  skin.  Hyaluronan  is  a  repeating  polymer  of  N-acetyl  glucosamine  and 
glucuronic acid that contributes to the soluble gel-like component of the extracellular matrix of the skin. 
Depolymerisation  of  hyaluronan  by  hyaluronidase  is  accomplished  by  hydrolysis  of  the  repeating 
polysaccharide  polymer.  This  depolymerisation  of  hyaluronan  results  in  a  transient  reduction  in  the 
viscosity of the gel-like phase of the extracellular matrix. The subsequent reduction in the hyaluronan 
viscosity  is  responsible  for  the  increased  hydraulic  conductance  that  facilitates  the  dispersion  and 
absorption of injected drugs.  
The  pharmacodynamic  action  of  trastuzumab  is  adequately  characterised.  PD  studies  submitted 
additionally  for  this  extension  aim  to  show  that  rHuPH20  facilitates  dispersion  and  absorption  of 
trastuzumab  and  indicate  that  trastuzumab  retains  its  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  to  inhibit 
xenografted tumour growth in nude mice. 
There  are  extensive  data  of  non-clinical  pharmacology  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  after  IV  administration 
available  with  trastuzumab.  In  support  of  this  proposed  line-extension,  the  applicant  provided 
additional  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  studies  with  the  objective  to  characterise 
exposure, distribution and elimination kinetics of rHuPH20 in animals; characterise the toxicity profile 
of  rHuPH20  in  mice  and  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  including  effects  on  reproduction;  characterise  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  subcutaneously  administered  trastuzumab  when  given  with  rHuPH20  in  mice, 
minipigs  and  cynomolgus  monkeys.    In  addition  SC  local  tolerance  data  with  trastuzumab  in  rabbits 
and  a  13-week  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  with  SC  administration  of  trastuzumab  in  Cynomolgus 
Herceptin

monkeys  (both  with  formulations  containing  rHuPH20)  supplemented  the  current  knowledge  of  non-
clinical aspects of the substance.  
No manufacturing changes were implemented over the course of the pivotal nonclinical safety studies 
with  rHuPH20.  The  batches  used  in  the  non-clinical  safety  studies  are  representative  of  material  that 
was used in the clinical studies. 
GLP aspects 
Studies submitted in support of this application were in compliance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Dye dispersion assays in mice  
Nude mice were injected intradermally with dye and the area of dye dispersal was quantified at 1, 2.5, 
5 and 20 minutes after injection.  Anaesthetised mice were either co-injected or injected sequentially, 
1-15 minutes apart, with  rHuPH20 at 0, 2, 10 or 100 units/animal and trypan blue dye at the same 
anatomical site.  Quantitative results are in Table 4.   
With co-injection, the area of dispersal of dye was significantly increased by rHuPH20 in a dose-
dependent manner.  When injected sequentially at fixed concentrations of rHuPH20, there was no 
difference in the degree of dye dispersal, indicating that the effect of rHuPH20 is very rapidly achieved 
(ie that the maximal effect is reached within 1 minute) and very short lasting.  Comparing different 
concentrations of rHuPH20, the time to reach maximal effect was decreased by increasing rHuPH20 
concentration.  When the anatomical site of administration of the dye and of rHuPH20 were markedly 
different (ie the right and the left sides of the mouse), the area of dye dispersal was not increased 
despite rHuPH20 being used at amounts up to 1200 units/animal (see Figure 1 below).   
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 17/70 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
A rabbit-derived neutralising antibody against rHuPH20 was given IV to mice 24 hours before ID 
injection of dye with and without 80 units of rHuPH20.  One further group were also injected ID with 
the rabbit antibody mixed with rHuPH20 and dye (tables 2, 3). Those injected with rHuPh20 and no 
antibody (Cohort 4) showed greater areas of discoloured skin than those given no rHuPH20 (Cohort 2) 
- ie the primary effect of rHuPH20 was shown.  Prior administration of the antibody did not affect the 
action of rHuPH20 to aid dispersal (Cohort 7 [highest dose of antibody] vs Cohort 4 [no antibody]). 
However, when coadministered, the antibody inhibited the action of rHuPH20 (Cohort 1 vs Cohort 7).  
Additional testing indicated that the antibody was detectable in mouse plasma in dose-dependent 
concentrations.     
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report

The effect of rHuPH20 was tested when given intravenously to nude mice, subsequently injected with 
dye intradermally.  In this study, nude mice were given a single intravenous injection of rHuPH20 at 
doses of up to 3000 units/animal and 45 minutes later were given an intradermal injection of trypan 
blue dye and the area of discoloured skin was quantified 5 and 15 minutes later.  There was a dose-
dependent increase in the area with increasing dose of intravenous rHuPH20.  At 5 minutes, the area 
was 58.07 mm sq at 30 units rHuPH20 compared to 117.54 mm sq at 3000 units rHuPH20 with 30 
units being the minimally effective dose.  Similar results were obtained when measured at 15 minutes, 
although the minimally effective dose was 10 units.  Thus, systemic administration of the dispersal 
agent, rHuPH20, was able to result in local expression of the intended effect.  
A study was done extending the period of observation of dispersal of dye following administration of 
rHuPH20 to determine effects when dye was given to mice intradermally at timepoints of 0.5, 1, 6, 18, 
24 and 48 hours after dosing with the rHuPH20.  The area of discoloured skin was determined at 5 and 
20 minutes after injection of dye.  In mice given rHuPH20, the area of dispersion was greater than in 
controls at 0.5, 1 and 6 hours but there was no difference at 18, 24 or 48 hours .  Therefore,   dermal 
reconstitution was complete between 6 and 18 hours.    
Antitumor  activity  of  a  Herceptin  IV  and  SC  formulation  containing  rHuPH20*  against  Calu-3  NSCLC 
xenografts in female Balab/c nude mice 
Initially, the systemic exposure to trastuzumab was tested in mice given one IV injection or one SC 
injection of trastuzumab containing rHuPH20, each at 10 mg/kg.  Steady state with intravenous and 
subcutaneous injection was projected on the basis of these results and it was determined that 10 
mg/kg whether given intravenously or subcutaneously, resulted in similar plasma concentration 
profiles, following 5 once-weekly injections.  This was selected as the high dose to determine effect on 
tumour growth and lower doses of 3 and 1 mg/kg were selected to delineate a dose-response effect.  
Nude mice were dosed subcutaneously with Calu-3 non small cell lung cancer cells (5x106 / animal) 
allowed to grow for 29 days, when trastuzumab dosing was initiated, given once weekly for 5 w eeks at 
1, 3 and 10 mg/kg either IV or SC, with the latter including a fixed dose of 4642 U/ml rHuPH20.  The 
last dose was given on day 64 and efficacy was assessed by tumour volume determinations on from 
days 29-71.  Serum trastuzumab concentrations were also determined just prior to the final dose was 
given.  (Figure x).  There was no difference in the tumour volume across groups prior to dosing 
starting on day 29.  At the dose of 1 mg/kg trastuzumab, there was no effect of treatment on tumour 
volume.  At 3 and at 10 mg/kg, there were clear effects to reduce tumour volume, by 38 and 39% for 
IV and SC routes respectively at the lower dose on day 71 and by 66 and 48% at the higher dose at 
the same time.  This apparent difference in activity (ie 66 v 48%) paralleled the plasma concentration 
on day 64 (96 and 61 μg/ml for intravenous and subcutaneous routes, respectively).

As  trough  concentrations  were  nearly  identical  after  IV  and  SC  administration,  the  same  Herceptin 
dose levels after IV and SC dosing were selected for the present study. 
In  contrast  to  the  predicted  Herceptin  serum  levels  of  approximately  100  μg/ml  after  5x  weekly 
administrations  of  10  mg/kg  IV  or  SC  (see  section  2),  a  comparable  mean  serum  level  was  reached 
only  with  the  10  mg/kg  IV  treatment  group  (95.7  μg/ml)  but  not  with  the  10  mg/kg  SC  treatment 
group (61.3 μg/ml).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Hyaluronidase activity in mouse plasma was quantified by a biotin – streptavidin binding assay.  
Neutralising antibodies to rHuPH20 in cynomolgus monkey plasma were quantified using a method 
based on the inhibition of hyaluronidase resulting in quantification of serum turbidity. A bridging ELISA 
method was developed to quantify antibodies to rHuPH20 in cynomolgus monkey plasma. An 
electrochemiluminescence method was developed to quantify anti-rHuPH20 antibodies in human 
plasma.  Trastuzumab was quantified in cynomolgus monkey serum using a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay. Antibodies to trastuzumab were quantified in cynomolgus monkey serum using 
a validated electrochemiluminescence assay.   
Systemic kinetics of rHuPH20 were determined in mice.  The elimination half-life was at ~2.4 minutes. 
Repeated dose PK study of rHuPh20 in cynomolgus monkeys: Two groups of naïve female cynomolgus 
monkeys were dosed iv at 0.3 mg/kg on day 1 and 30 mg/kg on day 2 (Group 1) and 3 mg/kg on day 
1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2 (Group 2).  Group 1 were dosed SC on day 3 with 1 mg/kg and on day 5 
with 10 mg/kg and Group 2 were dosed SC on day 3 with 3 mg/kg and on day 5 with 30 mg/kg.  For 
the intravenous doses, blood samples were taken pre-dose and at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 21/70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
post-dose and for the SC doses blood was taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8 and 24 hours (and also at 48 
hours after the dose on day 5 only).  (Table 9 ).   
In monkeys, rHuPH20 had a short half-life when given IV and its bioavailability after SC dosing was 
very low at <2.3%; at this level, accurate assessment of bioavailability is compromised.  Elimination of 
rHuPH20 was saturable resulting in a reduced elimination rate at higher doses with a consequent 
increase in half life and disproportionate increases in exposure with dose. After SC dosing, Tmax was 1-
4 hours and increased with dose.  By SC dosing, its half-life was at ~10 hours.   
The possible impact of rHuPH20 on trastuzumab kinetics was tested as follows.  A single dose study 
was done in three naïve male cynomolgus monkeys injected with trastuzumab formulated with 
rHuPH20.  Trastuzumab was formulated at 120 mg/ml and given subcutaneously at 25 mg/kg in a 
volume of 1.8 ml: test material also contained 6000 units/ml rHuPH20.  Blood was taken at multiple 
points between 0, 2 and 1344 hours after dosing and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 
used to determine trastuzumab concentrations.   Trastuzumab Tmax was at 24 hours and the 
elimination half-life was long at up to 356 hours.  It is concluded that this formulation could result in 
high exposure to trastuzumab.      
A comparative study between IV and SC dosing was done in female mice, presented in the 
pharmacology section as supporting dose selection for a subsequent study in xenografted mice.  In the 
pharmacokinetic study, separate groups of mice were given 10 mg/kg of trastuzumab formulated with 
4600 units/ml rHuPH20 (6000 units/ml had been intended) for the SC route.  It was determined that 
the subcutaneous bioavailability of trastuzumab was high at 83.4% and that T max was 7 hours.  Cmax 
was 287 and 125 μg/ml by intravenous and subcutaneous routes respectively.  Elimination 
characteristics were similar with half-life being 221 and 199 hours by these respective routes.  High 
exposures to trastuzumab can be achieved by SC dosing. Once Cmax had been reached the serum 
concentrations were similar after IV and SC routes.   
A study was conducted in nude mice to explore the distribution of rHuPH20 when injected either ID or 
IV.  In each case, 40 μl containing 2000 units/ml rHuPH20 was injected once.  A further group of mice 
were not dosed but served as controls.  For those dosed intravenously, blood was taken at 1, 15, 30, 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 22/70 
 
   
 
 
 
 
60, 240, 480 and 1440 minutes (up to 24 hours) for analysis of rHuPH20.  For those dosed ID, plasma, 
regional lymph nodes and skin were taken acquired at these same timepoints.   
This study indicated that rHuPH20 was detected within the dermis but rapidly dissipated with a half-life 
of 13-20 minutes.  Amounts in lymph were variable but low and there was no systemic exposure noted 
after intradermal injection.  With intravenous injection, rHuPH20 activity was detectable at 1 minute 
but was not detectable at 15 minutes and later timepoints.  The applicant concluded that these data 
show that rHuPH20 was both locally acting and transiently active.

After IV administration the PK parameters of trastuzumab were in the expected range for an immune 
globulin G in animals. The average clearance was 0.00616 mL/min/kg (equivalent to 0.370 mL/h/kg). 
Average  volume  of  distribution  at  steady-state  and  apparent  terminal  half-life  were  0.0776  L/kg  and 
136  h.  The  shape  of  the  serum  concentration-time  curves  suggests  a  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  of 
trastuzumab in the minipig. 
After SC administration trastuzumab absorption was more rapid from rHuPH20 containing formulations. 
After  SC  administration  of  the  trastuzumab  formulation  without  rHuPH20  (Group  2)  trastuzumab  was 
relatively slowly absorbed (median time to maximum serum levels 72 h). With all rHuPH20 containing 
formulations median times to maximum serum levels were 24 h. 
After  SC  administration,  maximum  trastuzumab  concentrations  tended  to  be  increased  with  rHuPH20 
containing formulations. At the 108 mg trastuzumab dose average maximum serum levels (±SD) were 
101  (±21.7),  126  (±13.2)  and  129  (±6.78)  μg/mL with  formulations  containing  0,  2000  and  6000 U 
rHuPH20. 
At  a  108  mg  trastuzumab  dose  average  average  SC  bioavailabilities  (±SD)  were  estimated  at  90.2 
(±23.1),  81.8  (±10.2)  and  87.2  (±10.8)  μg/mL  with  formulations  containing  0,  2000  and  6000  U 
rHuPH20.  With  the  very  high  SC  bioavailability  of  trastuzumab  in  the  minipig  there  was  no  further 
increase in bioavailability to be expected by addition of rHuPH20 in the formulation. 
Doubling  of  the  trastuzumab  dose  had  no  obvious  impact  on  the  SC  absorption.  At  the  216  mg 
trastuzumab SC dose, exposure was roughly twice as a high as for the 108 mg trastuzumab SC dose 
using the same formulation. 
After  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  trastuzumab  absorption  was  more  rapid  from  rHuPH20 
containing  formulations.  After  SC  administration  of  the  trastuzumab  formulation  without  rHuPH20 
(Group 2) trastuzumab was relatively slowly absorbed (median time to maximum serum levels 72 h). 
With all rHuPH20 containing formulations median times to maximum serum levels were 24 h.

After  SC  administration  maximum  trastuzumab  concentrations  tended  to  be  increased  with  rHuPH20 
containing formulations. At the 108 mg trastuzumab dose average maximum serum levels (±SD) were 
101  (±21.7),  126  (±13.2)  and  129  (±6.78)  μg/mL with  formulations  containing  0,  2000  and  6000 U 
rHuPH20.  Bioavailabilities  (±SD)  were  estimated  at  90.2  (±23.1),  81.8  (±10.2)  and  87.2  (±10.8) 
μg/mL with formulations containing 0, 2000 and 6000 U rHuPH20. At the 216 mg trastuzumab SC dose, 
exposure  was  roughly  twice  as  a  high  as  for  the  108  mg  trastuzumab  SC  dose  using  the  same 
formulation. 
Pharmacokinetics  of  trastuzumab  (RO0452317)  after  SC  administration  of  trastuzumab/rHuPH20  to 
Cynomolgus monkey 
Trastuzumab was administered SC at a dose level of 25 mg/kg in a formulation containing recombinant 
human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) as excipient (6000 U rHuPH20/mL formulation). The mean Cmax was 
307  μg/mL.  Cmax  was  reached  after  24  h  in  all  monkeys.  The  mean  AUC  (0-inf)  was  116  000 
(μg·h)/mL.  The  terminal  half-life  was  295  h,  i.e.  12.3  d;  the  MRT  was  426  h  (17.8  d).  The  mean 
apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.00377 mL/min/kg (equivalent to 5.43 mL/d/kg). 
Bioavailability 
The pharmacokinetic studies in all three species indicated a high bioavailability of trastuzumab after SC 
administration (bioavailabilities determined by non-compartmental analysis, table …).

No single dose toxicity studies were submitted as part of this application. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the 7 -day study, rHuPH20 was given once daily for 7 consecutive days at 5 mg/kg to male and  
female cynomolgus monkeys.  4 animals were dosed subcutaneously, 4 were dosed intravenously and 
4 further monkeys were assigned to a control group and dosed by both routes.  Clinical observations, 
body weights and food consumption were monitored daily.  Ophthalmology, haematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis parameters and toxicokinetic data were generated at specific time 
points.  Post mortem was scheduled at day 8.   
This dosing was well tolerated and there were no findings of toxicity on clinical or other measures.  
There were increases in liver enzymes and in creatinine kinase prior to dosing on day 2 in one control 
female and one male from each of the two groups given rHUPH20.  At post mortem, minimal 
hepatocytic vacuolation was seen in both males dosed subcutaneously, but the applicant judged this 
seemed unlikely to be treatment-related as it was not seen in the females and was not seen in any 
monkey dosed intravenously.  The applicant concluded that 5 mg/kg rHuPH20 was well tolerated by 
intravenous and by subcutaneous routes.   
In the 39 –week study, doses were selected at 0, 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/kg rHuPH20.  Dosing was by 
subcutaneous injection once weekly and this was given to groups of 6 male and 6 female cynomolgus 
monkeys, aged 4-7 years, with 4 males and 4 females from each group being euthanized for post-
mortem analyses at day 274 and the remainder formed a recovery group, being euthanized on day 
302, 4 weeks after their last dose.  Clinical observations were performed twice daily; testicular 
volumes were determined predose and at weeks 5, 18 and 38; menstrual cycles were monitored; food 
consumption was determined qualitatively, daily, and body weights were determined once weekly.  
Electrocardiograms were done predose and at weeks 13 and 36 at ~2, ~5 hours postdose, respectively 
and also in week 43.  Ophthalmology examinations were done predose and once during weeks 13, 39 
and 43.   Semen analyses were done predose and in weeks 12/13, 26/27 36/37 and in weeks 43/44.   
Haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis parameters and toxicokinetic data were 
generated at specific time points.  Blood was taken for pharmacokinetic analyses predose and at 0.25, 
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 16 hours following days 1 and again at the same points after dosing in weeks 3, 
13, 27 and 39; hyaluronidase activity was quantified using the ELISA described in the 
pharmacokinetics section of this report.  Antibodies to rHuPH20 were screened in samples taken 
predose and at days 7, 14, 42, 70, 95, 123, 140, 154, 182, 210, 238, 266, 274 in all monkeys and 
also at days 295 and 304 in those in the recovery group using the method described above.   
In this study, there were no abnormalities noted on clinical observations, body weight, food 
consumption, respiratory rates, blood pressures, electrocardiography, testicular volumes, semen 
analyses, menstrual cycling, ophthalmology (except for one instance of bilateral mucoid discharges on 
day 268 in one female given 0.2 mg/kg rHuPH20), haematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, or 
urinalysis.  There were no abnormal findings on gross pathological examination and no effect on organ 
weights was identified, apart from an increase in spleen weight and a decrease in thymus weights in 
males.  These were not dose-related and were without histological correlate and the applicant judged 
these to be not related to rHuPH20.  Minimal subcutaneous perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrations 
were noted at injection sites and these changes were attributed to rHuPH20 but this was reduced in 
the recovery groups, indicating reversibility.  Although an effect attributed to rHuPH20, this is 
considered by the applicant to be a non-specific response to injection of a human protein.  It was not 
judged adverse.  The no observed adverse effect level was set at 2 mg/kg  
Herceptin

In the study of the reformulated product with rHuPH20 for subcutaneous use, trastuzumab was given 
to male and female cynomolgus monkeys once weekly by subcutaneous injection of 0.25 ml/kg for 13 
weeks with a planned 17 week recovery phase.  Trastuzumab was given at the dose of 30 mg/kg and 
rHuPH20 was present at 12,000 units/ml, resulting in a dose of 3,000 units/kg.  This dose of 
trastuzumab was selected with an intent to give the same exposure as was achieved when given 
intravenously for 6 months at 25 mg/kg.  Toxicity was assessed by clinical observation, body weight, 
ophthalmology, electrocardiography, blood pressure and post mortem evaluations and blood was taken 
for toxicokinetic evaluations.  In this study, there were no unscheduled deaths and there were no 
adverse effects attributed to the test article.  The applicant assigned a no observed adverse effect level 
of 30 mg/kg at which dose the trastuzumab Cmax and AUC measured on day 78 were 1,160 μg/ml and 
166,000 μgh/ml.  Antibodies to trastuzumab were detected but only in 3 of 36 samples, during the 
recovery stage.  Samples were also tested for rHuPH20 but this was not detected and the applicant 
inferred that it is not absorbed after its subcutaneous injection. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were submitted in this application. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted in this application. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Embryofoetal development 
An evaluation of the potential for rHuPH20 was conducted, given subcutaneously, to affect fetal 
development in pregnant mice.  In an initial dose range finding study, groups of 8 mated, presumed 
pregnant mice were dosed once daily on days 6-15 of pregnancy at doses of 0, 1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg.  
The mice were euthanized on day 18 and effects on fetuses and pregnancy were determined.  There 
were no findings indicating toxicity of rHuPH20 at the lower three doses, except that one mouse at 10 
mg/kg showed a litter that was 68.8% resorbed: one had a fluid-filled bursal cyst on the right ovary.  
At the highest dose, there were three mice that had completely resorbed litters.  This finding was 
related by the applicant to the effect of rHuPH20.  Hyaluronic acid is a major glycoaminoglycan and 
component of cardiac jelly in the embryo that leads to the formation of the heart.  Other studies in 
mice deficient in hyaluronan and in whole embryos in which hyaluronan is degraded have shown 
resulting abnormalities in development of the heart.  This initial study concluded that the full study 
could be conducted with doses of 0, 3, 9, and 18 mg/kg.  In the main study, rHuPH20 was given as 
before at the doses just indicated to groups of 25 mated presumed pregnant mice.  The parameters of 
viability, clinical observations, body weight and body weight changes, food consumption, mating 
performance, necropsy observations Caesarean-sectioning, fetal sex ratio, fetal body weights, fetal 
gross external and soft tissue and skeletal alterations were evaluated.  Toxicokinetic data were 
generated in other mice dosed in the same manner.  There were 4 mice that were found dead with no 
cause identified; the applicant did not believe these were related to the test article because these mice 
had shown no signs of toxicity, the deaths were not dose-dependent and if related to rHuPH20, more 
deaths in the highest dose group on earlier gestation days would have been expected.  The deaths 
occurred in one satellite and one main study mouse at 18 mg/kg and two main study mice at 9 mg/kg.  
Otherwise, there were no adverse clinical or necropsy observations in maternal mice.  Pregnancy 
occurred in 23 or 24 of the 25 mice in each dose group.  Fetal body weights were reduced at 9 and 18 
Herceptin

mg/kg and there were increases in the number of late resorptions in these two groups compared to 
control, but unlike the fetal body weights, these were not statistically different from control.  No gross 
external, soft tissue or skeletal fetal alterations were noted.  Cmax and AUC of rHuPH20 on day 15 were 
20.9, 17.1 and 99.2 units/ ml and 55.1, 79.0 and 363 unit hours/ml at the 3, 9 and 18 mg/kg doses 
respectively.  The applicant set the maternal no observed adverse effect level at 18 mg/kg (as the 
deaths were not attributed to rHuPH20) and the developmental no observed adverse effect level at 3 
mg/kg.  rHuPH20 was concluded to be embryofetotoxic but not to induce overt dysmorphogenesis.   
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
The purpose of this study was to detect effects of rHuPH20 in pregnant mice from implantation through 
gestation and parturition and lactation and to determine if there were detectable effects on the 
development and behaviour of the offspring.  rHuPH20 was given once daily by subcutaneous injection 
to mated, presumed pregnant mice from day 6 to day 22 of gestation if they did not deliver, or if they 
did, to day 20 postpartum.  There 25 mice per group and doses were 0, 3, 6 and 9 mg/kg.  Mice were 
examined for clinical observations, abortions, premature deliveries and body weights.  This observation 
included during gestation, parturition and the pre-weaning period and observations of litter size and 
pup viability at birth were included.  At day 21 postpartum, maternal mice were euthanised and 
subject to gross necropsy.  The offspring were followed and clinical observations, body weight, age at 
vaginal patency or of preputial separation, and behavioural tests (passive avoidance for effects on 
learning, short- and longer-term memory) and motor activity and mating performance were also 
assessed.  Sex organs of the F1 males were examined post mortem after the males had completed 
their period of cohabitation with a female.  Pregnant females of the F1 generation were euthanised on 
gestation day 18.  In this study, one maternal mouse at each of 6 and 9 mg/kg was found dead and 
one further mouse at 9 mg/kg was euthanized due to their clinical condition: all these deaths were 
attributed by the applicant to reactions to human protein, rather than specific toxicity associated with 
rHuPH20.  In surviving mice, body weights and weight gains were unaffected by rHuPH20.  Pregnancy 
occurred in 88.0, 80.0, 84.0 and 80.0% of mice in the four respective test groups (control, low, mid 
and high dose) and there were no abnormalities noted during pregnancy and delivery and litter 
observations were all normal.  In the offspring, one female mouse was found dead on post-partum day 
31 without specific cause of death identified, but there were no other deaths.  There were no findings 
of toxicity in the F1 generation, but lower body weights were noted at 9 mg/kg than in the controls.  
Sexual maturation and performance, learning, memory and locomotor activity were all unaffected by 
rHuPH20.  The applicant concluded that in maternal mice and in their offspring, the no observed 
adverse effect level was 9 mg/kg.    
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic studies were submitted as part of this application. 
Local Tolerance  
Male New Zealand White rabbits were given a single subcutaneous dose of trastuzumab at 123 mg/ml 
in a dose volume of 0.5 ml (~61.5 mg/kg) and a similar dose of saline as control. The SC trastuzumab 
formulations used contained 2216 U/mL rHuPH20.  The dosing site was shaved prior to dosing and 
clinical observations were made during the in life period.  Three rabbits were euthanized at 24 hours 
after dosing and three were euthanized 98 hours after dosing and necropsy of the injection site was 
performed.  There were no unscheduled deaths.  The injection sites occasionally showed slight 
reddening, attributed to the needle and injection procedure.  There were no adverse findings at the 
injection site whether by clinical observation or at post mortem other than those attributable to the 
physical effects of injection (eg focal subcutaneous haemorrhaging).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Experiments  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  the  principle of  facilitation  of  the  systemic  dispersion  of 
trastuzumab via hyaluronan, in the form of rHuPH20.  Proof of relevant activity was shown in the study 
in  mice  where  intradermal  injection  of  dye  resulted  in  greater  areas  of  skin  discolouration  when  the 
dye  was  given  with  increasing  doses  of  rHuPH20.    The  effect  was  shown  on  coadministration  of  dye 
plus  rHuPH20,  resembling  the  coadministration  intended  with  trastuzumab  plus  rHuPH20.    The  time 
course  of  effect  was  explored  and  it  is  indicated  that  recovery  from  the  effect  of  rHuPH20  will  take 
place well within the clinical inter-dosing period.  
Testing was also done in animals to indicate whether there was any detrimental effect of formulating 
the product with rHuPH20 in terms of anti-tumour activity. Pharmacodynamic effects of a Herceptin 
formulation (containing rHuPH20) administered SC were compared to those of Herceptin IV in a 
xenograft model employing the HER2-positive Calu-3 cell line in female Balb/c nude mice. At 3 mg/kg 
Herceptin given IV or SC there was no difference in tumor growth inhibition comparing each treatment. 
Also terminal serum trough concentrations of Herceptin were similar for both dose routes. At 10 mg/kg 
Herceptin given IV or SC tumor growth inhibition was tended to be slightly higher after IV dosing, 
which was in line with the higher serum concentrations after IV dosing. In contrast to the predicted 
Herceptin serum levels of approximately 100 μg/ml after 5x weekly administrations of 10 mg/kg IV or 
SC (see section 2), a comparable mean serum level was reached only with the 10 mg/kg IV treatment 
group (95.7 μg/ml) but not with the 10 mg/kg SC treatment group (61.3 μg/ml). Digestion of tissue 
brought about by rHuPH20 allows a higher volume to be given subcutaneously, such that the amounts 
needed for therapeutic activity can be delivered by this route.   
Pharmacokinetic studies with trastuzumab SC were conducted in mice using a mouse xenograft model 
and in cynomolgus monkeys as part of an SC toxicology study. Additional studies on trastuzumab 
absorption were conducted in minipigs to demonstrate the permeation enhancing effect of rHuPH20 in 
the trastuzumab SC formulation and to support the selection of the rHuPH20 concentration in the 
trastuzumab SC formulation. The minipig was considered an appropriate model as the structure of its 
subcutaneous tissue is close to that in humans.  
Regarding  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  after  intravenous  administration  the  pharmacokinetic 
parameters  of  trastuzumab  were  in  the  expected  range  for  an  immune  globulin  G  in  animals.  The 
average  clearance  was  0.00616  mL/min/kg  (equivalent  to  0.370  mL/h/kg).  Average  volume  of 
distribution at steady-state and apparent terminal half-life were 0.0776 L/kg and 136 h. The shape of 
the  serum  concentration-time  curves  suggests  a  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  of  trastuzumab  in  the 
minipig. After SC administration trastuzumab absorption of rHuPH20 containing formulations was more 
rapid.  After  SC  administration  of  the  trastuzumab  formulation  without  rHuPH20  trastuzumab  was 
relatively slowly absorbed (median time to maximum serum levels 72 h). With all rHuPH20 containing 
formulations  median  times  to  maximum  serum  levels  were  24  h.  After  subcutaneous  administration 
maximum  trastuzumab  concentrations  tended  to  be  increased  with  rHuPH20  containing  formulations. 
At  a  108  mg  trastuzumab  dose  average  average  SC  bioavailabilities  (±SD)  were  estimated  at  90.2 
(±23.1),  81.8  (±10.2)  and  87.2  (±10.8)  µg/mL  with  formulations  containing  0,  2000  and  6000  U 
rHuPH20.  With  the  very  high  SC  bioavailability  of  trastuzumab  in  the  minipig  there  was  obviously  no 
further  increase  in  bioavailability  to  be  expected  by  addition  of  rHuPH20  in  the  formulation. 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report

Compartmental  pharmacokinetic  analysis  revealed  approximately  2-fold  higher  absorption  rate 
constants  associated  with  the  rHuPH20-containing  formulations.  However,  there  was  no  relevant 
increase in absorption rate constants for the formulation containing 6,000 vs. 2,000 U/mL.  
A  formal  rHuPH20  dose-finding  study  with  trastuzumab  SC  formulations  including  lower  enzyme 
concentrations  such  as  20  or  200  U/mL  (0.2  or  2  μg/mL)  was  not  performed  in  the  minipig  model. 
Lower  enzyme  concentrations  ranging  from  5  to  5000  U/mL  were  tested  only  in  the  mouse  dye 
dispersion  model  indicating  that  a  rHuPH20  concentration  exceeding  500  U/mL  (5  μg/mL)  would  be 
required to ensure the high dispersion effect. 
Data  from  a  clinical  study  with  a  rHuPH20  co-formulation  of  an  undisclosed  large  protein  molecule 
therapeutic (LPMT) suggested a concentration-dependent effect of rHuPH20 on LPMT absorption, with 
the highest effect on LPMT absorption at rHuPH20 concentrations of 1800 and 3500 U/mL. These data 
were the basis for the doses used in the minipig model. The results of the minipig study demonstrated 
that  rHuPH20  concentrations  of  2000  and  6000  U/mL  yielded  similar  results  in  terms  of  trastuzumab 
absorption rate, indicating that  higher rHuPH20 concentrations than the selected 2000U/mL were not 
necessary to further enhance the absorption rate. Therefore the usage of the lower dose is considered 
justified. Furthermore the proposed dose seems to have an acceptable safety margin (250-fold, based 
on  human-equivalent  doses,  at  the  no  adverse  effect  level  of  the  9-months  SC  toxicity  study  in 
cynomolgus monkeys. 
General toxicity studies were done with rHuPH20 alone and with the reformulated product, both using 
the SC route.  In the original assessment of trastuzumab, the only notable toxicity in cynomolgus 
monkeys was injection site trauma (presumably by intravenous injection).  The preclinical strategy to 
assess safety of the reformulated product for subcutaneous use was to conduct one study with 
trastuzumab formulated with rHuPH20, which was considered acceptable.  
Weekly  SC  administration  of  Herceptin/rHuPH20  at  30  mg/kg/dose  for  13  weeks  to  cynomolgus 
monkeys was well-tolerated and did not result in any adverse test article-related effects, and as such, 
the  no-observable-adverse  effect  level  was  30  mg/kg/dose.  It  is  noted  that  in  the  trastuzumab  SC 
group the trastuzumab exposure levels were comparable to the levels achieved in the highest dose (25 
mg/kg once weekly) applied in the trastuzumab IV chronic toxicity study. No toxicity was noted in the 
13-week toxicity study with trastuzumab SC. Local tolerability was also assessed by clinical observation 
and histopathology during the toxicity studies. Under the condition of the local tolerance study in male 
rabbits,  assessment  of  local  tolerance  in  the  rabbit  after  a  single  subcutaneous  application  of  60 
mg/injection  site  of  Herceptin  (0.5  mL/injection  site)  showed  no  findings  that  were  attributable  to 
treatment with the test item trastuzumab. Since the safety profile of the trastuzumab SC formulation is 
in general considered to be similar to that associated with IV dosing, the existing IV toxicology data for 
trastuzumab are considered to be relevant for SC administration as well. The IV data, however, were 
supplemented  by  local  tolerance  data  in  rabbits  with  trastuzumab  SC  and  a  13-week  repeat-dose  SC 
toxicity data in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
When given alone, rHuPh20 was without significant toxicity and the applicant set the highest doses 
tested as the no observed adverse effect levels.  In the 39 week study this was 2 mg/kg compared to a 
typical human dose of 0.0025 mg/kg when the reformulated product is given to patients.  The toxicity 
study with Herceptin SC containing rHuPH20 did not indicate any notable toxicity either.  Local 
tolerance testing supports the subcutaneous use of Herceptin SC containing rhuPH20. 
In this testing, weekly subcutaneous injection of up to 2 mg/kg rHuPH20 alone was well tolerated over 
39 weeks.  Weekly subcutaneous injection of reformulated product at a dose of 30 mg/kg trastuzumab 
and 3000 units/kg rHuPH20 was also judged well tolerated.  In this study, the trastuzumab Cmax and 
AUC were 1160 μg/ml and 166,000 μghr/ml.  These exposures exceed those in patients given the 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 30/70 
 
 
 
 
intended therapeutic dose.  For instance, Cmax and AUC at 12 mg/kg were 151 μg/ml and 3,550 
μgday/ml in patients.     
With regard to reproductive toxicity, studies indicated the possibility of an adverse effect with 
rHuPH20.  Based on clinical post-marketing experience, the SmPC for Herceptin advises that women 
should use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months thereafter; use in pregnancy can 
be permitted where the women is advised of the possibility of harm to the foetus.  The existing 
warnings can apply to the reformulated product too.   
The toxicity data provided for this application suffice to support the expectation of safety with rHuPH20 
in the formulation and for the product to be given subcutaneously.      
An exemption for the need for an environmental risk assessment with reference to the Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of human medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) is justified 
on the basis that amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrate and lipids are excluded because they 
are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Extensive data of non-clinical pharmacology in vitro and in vivo after IV administration available 
through the long experience with Herceptin are supplemented by a single dose local tolerance study in 
rabbits and a 13-week repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys performed to confirm that 
the change in route of administration and the use of the novel excipient recombinant human 
hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) did not have an effect on the Herceptin safety characteristics. Herceptin 
subcutaneous formulation was locally and systemically well tolerated. 
Non-clinical data for recombinant human hyaluronidase reveal no concerns based on conventional 
studies of safety pharmacology, and repeated dose toxicity. Reproductive toxicity studies revealed 
mechanism of action related embryofetotoxicity at high systemic exposure levels in mice. rHuPH20 did 
not influence reproduction in rabbit, mouse, cynomolgus monkey, and sheep. Reversible infertility has 
been reported in male and female guinea pigs.  
In conclusion non-clinical aspects are adequately described in support of this application, new 
information related to the subcutaneous formulation is included in the SmPC section 5.3.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study BP22023 
Methods 
Study  BP22023  (NCT00800436)  was  an  open-label,  two-part,  multi-center,  trastuzumab  dose-finding 
study in healthy male volunteers and HER2-positive female EBC patients.  The primary objective was 
to  select  the  dosing  regimen  of  a  new  formulation  of  trastuzumab  SC  that  resulted  in  exposure 
comparable to that achieved with the approved q3w IV regimen (8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 
mg/kg  maintenance  dose).    Secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of 
trastuzumab SC versus trastuzumab IV. The primary variable for the pharmacokinetic analysis was the 
observed trastuzumab Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 8. The pre-dose Cycle 8 time-point was chosen as it 
provides  an  estimate  of  the  steady-state  trastuzumab  concentration  prior  to  surgery  in  the 
neoadjuvant phase of treatment. 
This was a single dose administration study. The single dose of trastuzumab SC, which was expected 
to  result  in  comparable  exposure  to  a  6  mg/kg  IV  dose,  was  first  identified  in  HV  (Part  1)  and 
subsequently confirmed in female patients (Part 2, Table 3). In Part 1, the SC trastuzumab doses of 6 
and  10  mg/kg  were  selected  for  cohorts  3  and  4  based  on  different  SC  bioavailability  assumptions 
(100%  and  60%,  respectively).  The  selected  SC  dose  of  trastuzumab  based  on  cohorts  3  and  4  was 
subsequently administered to an additional cohort of 6 male subjects (cohort 5).  
In Part 2 of the study (confirmation), 40 female HER2-positive EBC patients were given a single dose 
of trastuzumab SC (8 or 12 mg/kg). Patients were enrolled into Cohort A to receive the dose level of 
SC  trastuzumab  defined  in  Part  1  of  the  study  in  HV.  The  dose  of  12  mg/kg  SC  trastuzumab  was 
selected  for  an  additional  cohort  (cohort  5)  to  investigate  comparability  of  trastuzumab  exposure  to 
that of the approved IV loading trastuzumab dose of 8 mg/kg based on historical data in breast cancer. 
The concentration of rHuPH20 of 2000 U/mL used in this study was guided by data from the study in 
mini-pigs  (see  non-clinical  section).  The  concentration  of  trastuzumab  in  the  SC  formulation  was  120 
mg/mL  (for  a  dose  of  12  mg/kg  trastuzumab,  a  70  kg  subject  would  receive  a  SC  dosing  volume  of 
approximately 7 mL, containing 14 000 U rHuPH20).

To  adequately  characterise  the  PK  characteristics  of  trastuzumab  SC,  serum  concentrations  were 
obtained pre-dose and at 5 time points up to day 1, followed by 11 time points between day 1 and day 
85, and at 5 months post-dose. Values for the primary PK parameter (AUC0–inf) were derived by non-
compartmental analysis (NCA). In addition, a population PK approach was used to analyse the IV and 
SC  PK  data  collected  and  to  support  the  selection  of  a  fixed  SC  dose  for  Phase III  using  simulations. 
The  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  First  Order  Conditional  Estimation  method  (FOCE)  with 
interaction in NONMEM version 6.0. The determination of the SC trastuzumab fixed dose was made by 
using modelling and simulation.  
Results 
Results from this single-dose administration study are summarised in Tables 3 and 4. From an interim 
PK  analysis,  the  SC  trastuzumab  dose  that  would  result  in  comparable  exposure  to  the  6  mg/kg  IV 
trastuzumab dose was predicted to be 8 mg/kg. The absolute bioavailability based on AUC0-inf in HV 
was 83.9, 91.3 and 93.2% for 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg trastuzumab SC, respectively, and 87.1 and 98.6% 
for 8 and 12 mg/kg trastuzumab SC in patients. Plasma rHuPH20 concentrations were below the limit 
of quantification (0.3125 U/mL) at all sampling time-points in all subjects.

Table 4. Trastuzumab serum pharmacokinetic parameters (Study BP22023) 
Selection of trastuzumab SC dose for the Phase III trial was based on a target Ctrough of 20 μg/mL or 
higher (based on mouse xenograft studies and early clinical response data in metastatic breast cancer: 
9269,  8738,  BL130972/0000,  90-099-1445  submitted  with  the  initial  marketing  authorisation)  and 
model-based evaluations of the Phase I data to select a fixed dose regimen without requirement of an 
initial  loading  dose.  From  a  range  of  doses  investigated  in  the  model-based  evaluations  (400  to  700 
mg),  a  fixed  dose  of  600  mg  trastuzumab  SC  (formulated  with  rHuPH20  at  a  concentration  of  2000 
U/mL) was selected by the applicant for Phase III since it was the dose able to achieve serum Ctrough 
levels in Cycle 8 (median 79 μg/mL) that were at least as high as those achieved by the q3W weight-
based  dosing  of  trastuzumab  IV  (median  46  μg/mL).  Predicted  AUC  at  the  end  of  the  dosing  period 
(AUCtau)  exposure  in  cycle  8  was  approximately  40%  higher  (2425  mg*day/L)  with  the  SC  regimen 
compared with the IV regimen (1723 mg*day/L). 
Study BO22227 
Sparse  PK  data  were  collected  during  the  treatment  up  to  21  days  after  each  dose  for  both 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases (see Main Study for a full description of study BO22227). In addition 
to the sparse sampling, rich PK sampling was obtained following the Cycle 7 dose in the neoadjuvant 
treatment phase and following the Cycle 12 dose during the adjuvant treatment phase.

The  PK  hypothesis  was  set  up  to  conclude  that  the  SC  dose  was  non-inferior  to  the  IV  dose  if  the 
geometric mean ratio CtroughSC/CtroughIV was equal or greater than 0.8, based on the lower bound 
of the two-sided 90% confidence interval. 
The  protocol  pre-defined pharmacokinetic  per  protocol  population  (PKPP)  consisted  of  all  the  patients 
who  had  at  least  one  measurable  trastuzumab  serum  concentration  excluding  patients  whose 
deviations  from  the  planned  administration  schedule  could  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  PK  and 
thereby  affect  the  assessment  of  non-inferiority.  Exclusion  criteria  (including  significant  deviations  in 
terms  of  dosing,  delays  in  the  date  of  sampling,  missing  data,  injection  site) were  predefined  for the 
population for the primary endpoint serum Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 8 (PKPP1) and for the secondary 
endpoint Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 13 (PKPP2). 
Results 
Pharmacokinetic  analysis  populations  and  results  are  summarised  in  Tables  5-7.  A  cross-study 
comparison is presented in table 8.  
The  geometric  mean  Ctrough  ratio  at  pre-dose  Cycle  8  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  90%  confidence 
interval  was  1.24  (Table  6),  which  was  larger  than  the  pre-specified  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.8.  A 
total of 98.7% of patients in the trastuzumab IV arm and 97% in the trastuzumab SC arm had Ctrough 
values at pre-dose Cycle  8 greater than 20 μg/mL. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the observed 
Ctrough  of  trastuzumab  SC  to  trastuzumab  IV  at  pre-dose  Cycle  13  was  1.51  (90%  CI:  1.40,  1.63). 
Median AUC exposure in cycle 12 also tended to be higher (19 %) after SC vs. IV exposure (2470 vs. 
2080 µg*day/ml).  
An evaluation of the time course of all available Ctrough levels from all treatment cycles confirmed that 
in  the  IV  group  steady  state  has  been  reached  at  cycle  8  whereas  in  the  SC  group  values  tend  to 
increase further up to cycle 13. A slight decline in Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 9 of about 10-20% was 
observed in both arms. This was consistent with the observation of delays in dosing following surgery, 
whereby, 114 patients were found to have delays in dosing ranging from 23-56 days. All changes were 
within the observed PK variability. 
In  patients  with  a  body  weight  <  50  kg  mean  steady  state  AUC  of  trastuzumab  SC  was  about  80% 
higher  than  after  IV  treatment.  The  percentage  of patients  with  trough  levels  greater  than  20  μg/mL 
was lower in the higher weight group (92%) after SC dosing in patients with body weights ≥ 90 kg in 
comparison to 100% after IV dosing on a mg/kg body weight basis. An approximately bioequivalent SC 
dose  based on  AUCss  would  be  8  mg/kg,  which  corresponds  to  about  400  mg,  600  mg,  and  750  mg 
flat doses for the respective BW groups <51, 51-90, and > 90 kg BW.  
In  a  population  PK  analysis,  trastuzumab  PK  was  described  by  a  two-compartment  linear  model  with 
first-order  absorption  and  first-order  elimination  following  SC  administration.  The  bioavailability  of 
trastuzumab following SC administration was estimated to be 82.2%. CL and Vc were estimated to be 
0.216  L/day  and  2.89  L,  respectively.  After  inclusion  of  all  significant  covariates  in  the  final  model, 
inter-individual variability was reduced from 28.9% to 23.7% for CL and from 17.8% to 14.9% for Vc. 
Body  weight  (WT)  was  identified  as  a  statistically  significant  covariate  for  trastuzumab  CL  and  Vc 
following SC and  IV administration. Baseline body  weight alone explained 22.3% of variability on CL. 
Ctrough  at  pre-dose  Cycle  8  and  Cycle  13  of  trastuzumab  was  not  affected  by  the  formation  of  anti-
trastuzumab  antibodies  or  by  the  formation  of  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies.  No  significant  association 
between Ctrough at pre-dose Cycle 8 and pCR or between AUC and overall occurrence of SAE or grade 
>3  AE  was  observed.  pCR  rates  were  broadly  similar  for  the  IV  and  SC  arm  irrespective  of  exposure 
and weight quartiles (Table 7).

Immunogenicity 
Twice as many patients developed antibodies to trastuzumab with the SC formulation compared to the 
intravenous  formulation  (7.1%  [21/296]  vs.  14.6%  [43/295])  (cut-off  date  for  ADA,  Jan  2013).  No 
influence of ADA occurrence on PK could be detected by population PK covariate analysis (see above). 
During  the  treatment  free-follow-up  phase  at  Months  3,  6,  and  12,  only  one  patient  in  the  IV  group 
and two patients in the SC group tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.   
The  ADA  occurrence  rate  for  rHuPH20  was  15.3%  (45/295)  in  Study  B022227  and  15.5%  (9/58)  in 
Study  BP22023  (baseline  rates  7.6%  and  12.1%,  respectively).  Neutralizing  antibodies  to  rHuPH20 
were not detected in any of the ADA positive samples.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the approach and the methodology employed are considered acceptable. Overall, sufficient 
data have been provided to characterise the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the SC formulation.  
Similar Cmax and AUC0-inf were observed between patients and HV in Part 1-2 of the Phase I study. 
Based  on  serum  pharmacokinetic  results,  the  selected  dose  of  8  mg/kg  SC  provided  22%  higher 
exposure  based  on  AUCinf  compared  to  6  mg/kg  IV  in  HV  (1960  vs.  1610  µg*day/mL).  Similarly,  a 
dose of 8 mg/kg SC in female patients provided higher exposure (16%) based on AUCinf compared to 
6 mg/kg IV (AUCinf 2090 vs. 1800 µg*day/mL).  
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 39/70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The selected rHuPH20 concentration of 2000 U/mL  in trastuzumab SC has an acceptable safety margin 
(250-fold,  based  on  human-equivalent  doses,  at  the  NOAEL  of  the  9-months  SC  toxicity  study  in 
Cynomolgus monkeys). In the Phase I study, rHuPH20 was not detected at any time point. However, 
based  on  the  detection  limit  of  the  assay  and  on  preclinical  data,  an  absorption  rate  of  5% 
corresponding  to  maximum  rHuPH20  plasma  concentrations  of  up  to  0.3  U/ml  and  potential 
accumulation  of  rHuPH20  after  multiple  dose  administration  cannot  be  excluded.  This  is  considered 
acceptable since accumulation is considered unlikely in view of the rapid plasma clearance observed in 
non-clinical studies and any potential accumulation of rHuPH20 is expected to be below NOAEL. 
The Applicant will investigate improvement of the detection limit of the rHuPH20 assay (targeting a 30-
fold  improvement)  and,  if  a  meaningful  reduction  in  LLOQ  is  achieved,  determine  absolute  systemic 
bioavailability and half-life of rHuPH20 in a clinical study 
In the  Phase III trial, the  SC  formulation was shown to be  non-inferior to the IV regimen for the co-
primary PK endpoint. The proportion of patients with trough (pre-dose) levels greater than 20 μg/mL 
was very high and similar for the two regimens prior to cycle 8 and 13. Since no significant relationship 
between  exposure  (AUC  and  Ctrough)  and  response  parameters  (pCR  rate  or  best  response 
parameters)  or  safety  parameters  could  be  identified  for  the  IV  and  SC  arms,  there  is  no  good 
rationale for dose adjustment according to body weight.  
Although  the  incidence  of  neutralizing  antibodies  in  the  treatment-free  follow-up  phase  was 
reassuringly  low  in  both  groups,  more  patients  developed  anti-trastuzumab  antibodies  with  the 
subcutaneous  formulation than  with the  IV  formulation. More data are  needed to finally evaluate this 
finding  and  its  impact.  Monitoring  of  ADA  formation  in  the  extension  of  the  follow-up  phase  of  the 
BO22227  trial  is  included  as  an  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  linked  to  the  potential  risk  of 
immunogenicity  (see  RMP).  A  clinical  impact of  cross-reactivity  of  ADA  with  endogenous  PH20,  which 
plays a role in fertility and neurogenesis/neuronal repair, cannot be excluded (see non-clinical section). 
The applicant will provide follow-up data from immunogenicity analyses on anti-trastuzumab and anti-
rHuPH2 antibodies as part of the BO22227 Annual Report to be submitted with the March Data Lock 
Point (DLP) Herceptin PSUR. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab at a dose of 600 mg administered three-weekly by the 
subcutaneous route was compared to the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab intravenous route 
(8 mg/kg loading dose, 6 mg/kg maintenance every three weeks) in the phase III study BO22227. The 
pharmacokinetic results for the co primary endpoint, Ctrough pre dose Cycle 8, showed non-inferiority of 
the Herceptin subcutaneous compared to the Herceptin intravenous formulation dose adjusted by body 
weight.  
The mean Ctrough during the neoadjuvant treatment phase, at the pre dose Cycle 8 time point, was 
higher in the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation arm (78.7 µg/mL) than the Herceptin intravenous 
formulation arm (57.8 µg/mL) of the study. During the adjuvant phase of treatment, at the pre-dose 
Cycle 13 time point, the mean Ctrough values were 90.4 µg/mL and 62.1 µg/mL, respectively. While 
steady state with the intravenous formulation was reached at cycle 8, concentrations tended to 
increase further up to cycle 13 with the subcutaneous administration. The mean Ctrough at the 
subcutaneous pre- dose cycle 18 was 90.7 µg/mL and is similar to that of cycle 13, suggesting no 
further increase after cycle 13. 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/70 
 
 
 
 
 
The median Tmax following subcutaneous administration of the cycle 7 dose was approximately 3 days, 
with high interindividual variability (range 1-14 days). The mean Cmax following the cycle 7 SC dose 
was expectedly lower in the trastuzumab subcutaneous formulation (149 μg/mL) than in the 
intravenous arm (end of infusion value: 221 μg/mL). 
The Applicant will investigate the improvement of the detection limit of the rHuPH20 assay (targeting a 
30-fold improvement) and, if a meaningful reduction in LLOQ is achieved, determine absolute systemic 
bioavailability and half-life of rHuPH20 in a clinical study which is to be further discussed in the context 
of the next RMP revision, depending on the feasibility. 
Monitoring of ADA formation in the extension of the follow-up phase of the BO22227 trial is included as 
an additional pharmacovigilance activity linked to the potential risk of immunogenicity (see RMP).  
The applicant will provide follow-up data from immunogenicity analyses on anti-trastuzumab and anti-
rHuPH2 antibodies as part of the BO22227 Annual Report to be submitted with the March Data Lock 
Point (DLP) Herceptin PSUR.

• 
Trastuzumab IV: loading dose of 8 mg/kg infused over a 90-min period. All subsequent doses were 
6 mg/kg and these could be administered over a 30-min period if the first administration was well-
tolerated 
•  Docetaxel (75 mg/m2 IV infusion) after completion of trastuzumab administration, every 3 weeks 
for 4 cycles (cycles 1-4)  
• 
FEC: 5-Fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 IV bolus or infusion), epirubicin (75 mg/m2 IV bolus or infusion) 
and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 IV bolus or infusion), every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (cycles 5-8). 
Trastuzumab  IV and SC were administered 3-weekly for 18 cycles unless intolerable toxicity occurred 
or investigator assessed disease progression had occurred. Trastuzumab IV and SC were administered 
before  starting  the  infusion  of  chemotherapy.  All  doses  of  trastuzumab  SC  were  administered  as  a 
subcutaneous injection into the thigh over 2-5 minutes by a trained health care professional. 
Objectives 
To compare the following parameters between trastuzumab IV and trastuzumab SC in the neoadjuvant 
setting: 
•  Serum trough concentrations observed pre-surgery; 
•  Efficacy (pathological complete response). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-primary endpoints 
The  co-primary  endpoints  were  observed  Ctrough  pre-surgery  and  pathological  complete  response 
(pCR). For the pharmacokinetic endpoint see clinical pharmacology.  
Pathological  complete  response  of  the  primary  tumor  was  defined  as  absence  of  invasive  neoplastic 
cells  at  microscopic  examination  of  the  primary  tumor  remnants  after  surgery  following  primary 
systemic therapy. The response was classified as “pCRis” in case only in-situ  carcinoma was found in 
the  tumor  remnants.  pCR  was  assessed  by  the  local  pathologist  following  surgery  (no  independent 
review).  
Post-baseline  tumor  assessments  were  to  be  performed  every  other  cycle  and  prior  to  surgery. 
Patients whose pCR assessment was missing were counted as not having achieved pCR. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
• 
Total pathological Complete Response (tpCR), defined as the absence of invasive neoplastic cells 
in the primary tumor remnants and in the axillary lymph nodes 
Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as clinical complete response or partial best tumor response. 
Clinical tumor response was evaluated according to RECIST. Cinical tumor response was measured 
using assessment by caliper and ultrasound in order to achieve consistency in tumor assessments 
across  sites.  In  addition  to  the  primary  breast  tumor(s),  affected  lymph  nodes  if  present,  were 
considered  target  lesions,  provided  they  have  a  size  of  ≥  1  cm  by  ultrasound  or  ≥  2  cm  by 
palpation.  Inflammatory  breast  cancer  was  considered  as  non-target  lesion.  Response  of 
inflammatory breast cancer was assessed based on erythema/edema, which were both considered 
as non-measurable lesions in the protocol. 
• 
Overall  Survival  (OS)  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  death, 
regardless of the cause of death.  
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 42/70 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
Event-free  survival  (EFS)  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of 
disease recurrence or progression or death due to any cause. 
Other secondary endpoints included Time to Response (TTR), Pathological Complete Response in Situ 
(pCRis) (data not shown). 
Sample size 
The hypothesis for the co-primary variable pCR was one of non-inferiority with a margin of 12.5%. The 
null-hypothesis  was  rejected  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  one-sided  97.5  %  confidence  interval  for  the 
difference in pCR proportion using the continuity correction of Anderson and Hauck (1986) was greater 
than -12.5%. Assuming pCR rates of at least 40% in both arms and 10% drop-out, 552 patients were 
required (power 80%). 
The non-inferiority margin was based on a meta-analysis of two studies (Buzdar, 2005; Gianni, 2010), 
where  the  difference  in  proportion  [pCRIV-pCRchemo  alone]  was  estimated  to  be  23.7%  (95%  CI: 
12.76%; 34.56%); 12.5% was selected as the lower bound of the 95% CI [pCRSC-pCRIV] that would 
ensure that the lower bound of the “indirect” 95%CI [pCRSC-pCRchemo alone] would be above zero. 
Randomisation 
Randomization (central) was stratified by breast cancer type (operable versus locally advanced versus 
inflammatory breast cancer), and estrogen receptor status (positive, negative, unknown). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The  intent  to  treat  population  (ITT)  set  included  all  patients  having  at  least  one  efficacy  assessment 
after first study drug administration (treatment assignment as randomized for analysis purposes). The 
efficacy  per  protocol  (EPP)  set  was  defined  as  the  subset  of  the  ITT  set  defined  by  the  following 
exclusions:  less  than  8  cycles  of  trastuzumab/chemotherapy  treatment;  metastatic  breast  cancer 
before  entering  the  study;  previous  anti-cancer  therapy;  HER2  negative  patients;  major  violation  of 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  Treatment  assignment  followed  treatment  actually  received  for  analysis 
purposes. Standard statistical methods were used. The EPP set was the main analysis set.

Results 
Participant flow (at clinical cut-off date of 12 July 2011) 
* One patient did not undergo the primary surgery after completion of the neoadjuvant treatment phase.  
** Two patients were prematurely withdrawn due to disease progression after completion of 8 cycles of 
treatment but nevertheless underwent surgery and are included in the analyses. 
Recruitment 
A total of 833 patients were screened and 596 patients were randomized at 81 centres in 24 countries: 
106  patients  from  Germany  (No.  of  centres=8),  France  (5),  Spain  (5),  Italy  (3),  Sweden  (2);  95 
patients  from  Hungary  (3),  Poland  (3),  Czech  Republic  (2),  Slovakia  (2),  Estonia  (1);  134  patients 
from  Russia  (10);  96  patients  from  Brazil  (6),  Peru  (5),  Colombia  (3),  Guatemala  (1),  Mexico  (1), 
Panama  (1); 122 patients from Taiwan (4),  Thailand (4), Korea (3), China  (1); and 43 patients from 
South Africa (4), Turkey (3), and Canada (1). 
The main reasons for screening failure was Her-2 status not confirmed centrally (n=136) and withdrawal of 
consent  (n=31).  The  first  subject  was  randomised  in  October  2009  and  the  last  patient  in  December 
2010; the clinical cut-off date for the primary analysis was 12 July 2011 and for the follow-up analysis 
09 July 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol  amendments  included  updated  pharmacokinetic  and  safety  information  from  trial  BP22023, 
minimum tumour size, response criteria for inflammatory breast cancer.

Post-surgery patients received radiotherapy as per the investigator’s clinical decision. Radiotherapy to 
the axilla, chest wall or “other” site was given to 47.7% of patients in the trastuzumab IV arm and 
54.2% of patients in the trastuzumab SC arm. Local or regional lymph nodes were irradiated in 40.6% 
and 43.1% of patients under trastuzumab IV and SC, respectively. Radiotherapy to the breast was 
performed in 33.9% and 37.4% of patients in the trastuzumab IV and trastuzumab SC arms, 
respectively. 
Hormonal therapy was initiated in hormone receptor positive patients only after primary surgery. As 
per clinical cut-off, tamoxifen was the most frequent hormonal treatment given to 26.5% of patients in 
the trastuzumab IV arm and 33.7% of patients in the trastuzumab SC arm. Anastrozole and letrozole 
were used for treatment in 6.7% and 7.0% of trastuzumab IV patients, and in 6.1% and 4.7% of 
patients of the trastuzumab SC arm, respectively. Among the gonadotropin and analogues class, 
goserelin was the drug given most frequently: 2.7% and 3.0% in the trastuzumab IV and trastuzumab 
SC arms, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
A  total  of  591  patients  (297  patients  in  trastuzumab  IV  and  294  patients  in  trastuzumab  SC)  were 
included in the ITT population. Five patients (2 patients in trastuzumab IV, 3 in trastuzumab SC) were 
excluded from the ITT population because they did not have an efficacy assessment after baseline. 
The  EPP  set  included  523  patients  (263  patients  in  trastuzumab  IV  and  260  patients  in  trastuzumab 
SC). A total of 73 patients were excluded from the EPP population due to at least one major protocol 
violation, 36 patients from the trastuzumab IV arm and 37 patients from the trastuzumab SC arm. The 
Herceptin

most common reason for exclusion from the EPP was that patients were withdrawn prematurely from 
the neoadjuvant phase (received < 8 cycles of treatment; 21 patients in each treatment arm).

EFS and OS data were not sufficiently mature at the time of the clinical cut-off date for the primary 
analysis (12 July 2011). 15 patients (5.7%) in the trastuzumab IV arm and 13 patients (5.0%) in the 
trastuzumab SC arm (EPP population) had experienced an EFS event. Six months after randomization, 
98% of patients in each treatment arm were event-free. One patient in each arm had died within the 
EPP population. 
A follow-up analysis (clinical cut-off date of 9 July 2012) of EFS was provided after a median duration 
of follow-up of approximately 20 months in both arms (as compared to about 12 months for the main 
analysis). In this analysis, the 1-year rate was .95 (95%CI: .92; .97) and .95 (.93; .98) for 
trastuzumab IV and SC, respectively (EPP population). The 2-year EFS rates were .82 (.76; .87) in the 
trastuzumab IV arm and .83 (.78; .89) in the trastuzumab SC arm (EPP).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Potential  advantages  of  the  EBC  setting  for  comparing  trastuzumab  IV  and  SC  are  that  patients  are 
treatment-naïve and the population was considered more homogenous with fewer confounding factors 
than patients with MBC.  
The choice of pCR as primary efficacy endpoint is generally acceptable but pCR can only be considered 
a surrogate parameter and non-inferiority in terms of pCR should be supported by long-term outcome 
data. The Applicant will update the analysis on EFS and OS once the last patient has completed the 24 
months follow-up period and will present the final analysis including efficacy once the last patient has 
completed the 60 months follow-up period. 
The efficacy data from the neoadjuvant(/adjuvant) setting can be extrapolated to the metastatic breast 
cancer setting based on the clinical efficacy and pharmacological outcomes. 
Although  pCR  adjudication  was  done  according  to  local  review,  the  Applicant  provided  data  from  a 
retrospective  questionnaire  demonstrating  that  for  71%  of  patients  the  pathologist  was  blinded  to 
treatment by local procedures (data not shown).  
In  general  the  demographic  data  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  are  balanced  between  the 
treatment groups.  
In  principle  a  single  pivotal  Phase  III  trial  comparing  the  new  SC  formulation  and  dose  regimen  with 
the  current  standard  intravenous  trastuzumab  regimen  is  considered  adequate  to  support  this  line 
extension, the objective of this trial being to demonstrate non-inferiority of the subcutaneous injection 
to  the  intravenous  infusion.  The  choice  of  the  clinical  setting  (neoadjuvant  treatment  in  early  breast 
cancer)  and  co-primary  PK  and  efficacy  endpoints  (trastuzumab  Ctrough  and  pCR)  were  endorsed  in 
scientific  advice  meetings;  indeed,  this  clinical  model  was  considered  sufficiently  sensitive  to  enable 
the detection of differences between the two regimens. 
In  the  chemotherapy  regimen  chosen  for  this  study,  the  dose  of  docetaxel  was  reduced  from  the 
registered dose of 100 mg/m² to 75 mg/m² to increase the tolerability. This dose reduction might have 
influenced  the  relatively  low  pCR-results  (especially  in  the  trastuzumab  IV  arm)  compared  to  other 
studies  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting.  A  higher  docetaxel  dose  used  in  clinical  practice  could  lead  to  an 
increased toxicity in combination with trastuzumab SC (see discussion on clinical safety). 
The  MAH  has  chosen  the  non-inferiority  margin  (-12.5%)  in  order  to  ensure  assay  sensitivity  of  SC 
trastuzumab  +  chemotherapy  with  respect  to  no  trastuzumab  treatment  (i.e.,  chemotherapy  alone). 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 50/70 
 
 
 
 
 
Such  margin,  through  indirect  comparisons  would  allow  to  conclude  that  SC  trastuzumab  + 
chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone. The choice of non-inferiority margin was not in line 
with the EMA “Guideline on the choice of the non-inferiority margin” EMEA/CPMP/ewp/2158/99. If the 
objective is to show that there is no important loss of efficacy if the test product is used instead of the 
reference, the choice of delta for such an objective cannot be obtained by only looking at past trials of 
trastuzumab  IV  plus  chemotherapy  against  chemotherapy  alone.  To  adequately  choose  delta  an 
informed  decision  must  be  taken,  supported  by  evidence  of  what  is  considered  an  unimportant 
difference  in  the  particular  disease  area.  Nevertheless,  despite  this  shortcoming,  the  results  are 
sufficiently  convincing  to  allow  excluding  important  loss  of  efficacy  for  the  SC  trastuzumab  + 
chemotherapy, compared to IV trastuzumab +chemotherapy, in the population studied. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The point estimate for pCR was in favour of the subcutaneous administration and a potential maximum 
loss  of  efficacy  of  4.0%  for  the  subcutaneous  route,  as  shown  by  the  confidence  interval,  is  not 
considered to be clinically relevant. 
Non-inferiority in terms of pCR was demonstrated in the EPP analysis. The results from the EPP and ITT 
populations were consistent. This is also supported by the results of tpCR as secondary endpoint. 
Due  to  the  short  duration  of  follow-up  there  were  insufficient  events  to  draw  reliable  conclusions  on 
time related outcome measures like EFS or OS (see above). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The single pivotal study B022227 demonstrated non-inferior efficacy of the fixed dose trastuzumab SC 
formulation  compared  with  the  standard  trastuzumab  IV  formulation.  Efficacy  was  demonstrated  by 
comparable pCR-rates in the neoadjuvant setting in patients with early breast cancer. pCR as primary 
efficacy endpoint and the extrapolation of the efficacy data to the metastatic breast cancer setting was 
considered  acceptable.  Overall,  a  comparable  efficacy  of  a  fixed  dose  of  trastuzumab  SC  with 
trastuzumab IV is considered sufficiently established. 
The Applicant will update of the analysis on EFS and OS once the last patient has completed the 24 
months follow-up period and will present the final analysis including efficacy once the last patient has 
completed the 60 months follow-up period (see RMP). 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
For  Study  BO22227  all  safety  analyses  were  based  on  the  Safety  Analysis  Population  (SP).  The  SP 
included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication  (chemotherapy  or 
trastuzumab),  and  comprises  595  patients  who  were  included  as  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  July  12, 
2011 (298 patients in the trastuzumab IV arm and 297 patients in the trastuzumab SC arm; of the 596 
patients randomized, one patient from the trastuzumab IV arm did not receive study medication). For 
many  analyses,  an  updated  data  set  with  cut-off  date  of  July  2012  was  provided  (the  latter  are 
described in this report, when available). 
Patient exposure 
As expected with the fixed dose of trastuzumab SC, the median dose intensity was lower in the 
trastuzumab IV arm (135.63 mg/week) compared with that in the trastuzumab SC arm (196.36 
mg/week). The median relative dose intensity (ie, percentage of planned dose) was high (at least 98% 
in both treatment arms), indicating good tolerability of trastuzumab SC versus trastuzumab IV. The 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report

median number of cycles received was 18.0 (range 1-20) in the trastuzumab IV arm and 18.0 [range 
1-18] in the trastuzumab SC arm, indicating that the majority of patients included in the analysis set 
nearly completed the full treatment phase (8 cycles concomitantly with chemotherapy before surgery 
followed by 10 cycles after surgery to complete one year of treatment with trastuzumab). Two patients 
received more than 18 cycles of treatment in the trastuzumab IV arm. 
Dose-delay or interruption of trastuzumab was overall balanced between both treatment arms. A total 
of 64.2% (382/595) of patients experienced at least one dose-delay/interruption during the overall 
treatment phase (193/298 [64.8%] in trastuzumab IV, 189/297 [63.6%] in trastuzumab SC) which 
included concomitant treatment with chemotherapy before surgery. 
There were no relevant differences between the two treatment arms for docetaxel exposure , 5-
fluorouracil exposure , epirubicin exposure or cyclophosphamide exposure , with respect to the median 
values for the planned dose intensity and the median number of cycles (data not shown). The median 
number of cycles was 4 and the planned dose intensity was at least 99% in both groups. The 
proportion of patients with at least one dose delay, interruption or modification of docetaxel was 
slightly lower in the trastuzumab IV arm (45/298 patients [15.1%]) than in the trastuzumab SC arm 
(62/297 [20.9%]). 
Most patients received at least one treatment for adverse events before or during the course of the 
study (81.2% in trastuzumab IV, 85.5% in trastuzumab SC). The most frequently used treatments 
were non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (31.2% vs. 33.7%), analgesics (26.2% vs 29.3%) and 
corticosteroids (24.8% vs 27.3%). During the neoadjuvant phase, there were slightly fewer patients 
receiving at least one treatment for adverse events in the trastuzumab IV arm (75.5%) compared to 
the trastuzumab SC arm (80.8%). The most frequently used treatments were G-CSF (21.8% vs 
25.9%), analgesics (22.5% vs 24.2%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (20.8% vs 24.9%), 
corticosteroids (19.5% vs 22.2%), antihistamines (19.8% vs 19.5%), anti-emetics (18.1% vs 18.2%) 
and 5-HT3 antagonist class (16.4% vs 14.8%). During the adjuvant period there were a similar 
proportion of patients receiving at least one medication for adverse events in both treatment arms 
(51.7% in trastuzumab IV vs 50.5% in trastuzumab SC). The most commonly used treatments were 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (15.1% vs 17.8%), analgesics (10.1% vs 13.8%) and antihistamines 
(7.4% vs 10.1%).   
Adverse events  
There was no apparent difference in the types of and incidence of the most common AEs across study 
groups. The most frequently occurring AEs were alopecia, nausea, neutropenia, diarrhoea, asthenia, 
fatigue and vomiting. The overall safety profile in both groups was consistent with that expected from 
combination treatment with trastuzumab, anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab. As to be expected 
the majority of adverse events occurred during the neo-adjuvant treatment phase because of the 
concomitant chemotherapy.  
Overall, the proportion of patients reporting a Grade ≥ 3 AE was similar in both treatment arms (9 July 
2012 cut-off; 52.3% vs 53.5% in the trastuzumab IV and SC respectively). The distribution of patients 
with Grade ≥ 3 AEs was comparable across both arms for all SOCs. The highest incidence of Grade ≥ 3 
AEs was reported in the SOC blood and lymphatic system disorders with neutropenia, leucopenia  and 
febrile neutropenia being the most common events in both the trastuzumab IV and the trastuzumab 
SC arms. However, the proportion of patients reporting an SAE was higher in the trastuzumab SC arm 
(21.5%) than in the trastuzumab IV arm (14.1%). 
While the overall incidence of cardiac AEs was similar in both study arms, the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 
cardiac  AEs  and  SAEs  were  numerically  slightly  higher  in  the  trastuzumab  SC  arm  (severe  AEs  1.0% 
Herceptin

vs. 1.7% of patients [n= 3 vs. 5] and SAEs 0.7% vs. 1.7% of patients [n= 2 vs. 5] in the trastuzumab 
IV  and  trastuzumab  SC  arms,  respectively).  In  total  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  had  LVEF 
decreases of ≥ 10% to a value < 50% (2.1 and 2.4%), but in the trastuzumab SC arm one patient was 
withdrawn because of symptomatic CHF (NYHA class II,  the patient had cardiac risk factors). No CHF 
of  NYHA  class  III  or  IV  was  observed.  In  addition,  there  were  three  other  possible  cases  of  cardiac 
events in the trastuzumab SC arm (sudden death, chest pain, and pleural effusion). 
As  to  be  expected  the  majority  of  adverse  events  occurred  during  the  neo-adjuvant  treatment  phase 
because  of  the  concomitant  chemotherapy.  However,  similar  to  the  safety  profile  in  the  neoadjuvant 
treatment phase) also for the adjuvant treatment phase a higher rate of serious AEs (3.4% vs. 8.1%), 
and  AEs  leading  to  withdrawals  (1%  vs.  3.7%)  were  reported  for  the  trastuzumab  SC  arm 
(trastuzumab IV vs. trastuzumab SC, respectively. In the adjuvant phase also a trend for more severe 
AEs were reported in the trastuzumab SC arm (10.4% vs. 12.8%). The SAE  imbalance between both 
treatment  arms  was  mainly  due  to  events  in  the  SOC  infections  and  the  difference  in  the  infectious 
SAEs and severe infection events between both treatment arm was driven by SAEs and severe events 
reported during the adjuvant treatment phase. The infections of the SC arm in the adjuvant treatment 
phase included infections both with and without neutropenia. From a clinical point of view these events 
were manageable (resolved within a mean of 13 days and 17 days in the IV and SC arms respectively), 
however  relevant  from  a  patients  perspective  (requiring  hospitalization  or  IV  antibiotics  for  systemic 
infections). 
In  the  trastuzumab  SC  arm  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  experienced  AEs  suggestive  of 
administration-related  reactions  (37.2%  vs.  47.8%  in  the  trastuzumab  IV  vs.  trastuzumab  SC  arm, 
respectively; grade 3 events 2.0% vs 1.7%). The most common AEs reported included rash, pruritus, 
cough  and  dyspnea.  Most  of  these  events  were  non  severe  (Grade  <3).  There  were  no  Grade  4  or  5 
administration- related reactions reported in either arm. The Applicant will further characterize time to 
onset of ARRs after administration of trastuzumab SC in the ongoing study SafeHer.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The proportion of patients for whom at least one SAE was recorded was higher in the trastuzumab SC 
arm. SAEs were more frequently reported in the SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders and 
infections and infestations. Although the number of events was small, there was also a higher 
incidence of SAEs in the SOC cardiac disorders. Most of the overall difference in SAEs between the two 
treatment arms was due to events in the SOC infections and infestations; the remaining difference was 
due to a higher number of sporadic events in the trastuzumab SC arm reported across SOCs.  
The reporting rate of SAEs varied widely across countries and regions, e.g. in the SC arm, from 41.2% 
in South Africa down to 10.5% in Eastern Europe, where the latter contributed for 38% of the patient 
population (clinical cut-off date of 9 july 2012).  
For  the  adjuvant  treatment  phase  a  higher  rate  of  serious  AEs  and  AEs  leading  to  withdrawals  were 
reported for the trastuzumab SC arm (3.4% vs. 8.1% and 1.3% vs. 3.7% for the trastuzumab IV vs. 
trastuzumab SC respectively). Events in the SOC infections and infestations largely accounted for the 
SAE  imbalance  (1.7%  vs.  4.4%)in  the  adjuvant  treatment  phase.  An  imbalance  in  administration-
related  reactions  was  also  reported  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  phase  (12.1%  of  patients  in  the 
trastuzumab IV arm and 18.5% of patients in the trastuzumab SC arm), however most administration 
related reactions in either treatment phase were non-severe (Grade <3).  
The  cumulative  exposure  of  trastuzumab  over  the  full  treatment  period  neo-  +  adjuvant  for  i.v.  and 
s.c. administered trastuzumab was estimated.  
At the clinical cut-off date of 09 July 2012, six SAEs with fatal outcome had been reported for reasons 
other than progressive disease. Two of these (myeloid leukemia in the treatment free follow up more 
than 6 months after last study drug administration; pneumonia in the neoadjuvant phase) occurred in 
the IV arm of the BO22227 study and four (septic shock in the neoadjuvant phase; sudden death in 
the neoadjuvant phase; myocardial infarction in the neoadjuvant phase; endometrial cancer in the 
treatment free follow-up phase) in the SC arm. Despite pre-existing cardiac risk factors of 
hypertension and overweight in the patients with sudden death and myocardial infarction and 
additional elderly age and diabetes in one of the patients, a relation to the treatment with trastuzumab 
could not be ruled out.

Laboratory findings 
The pattern of laboratory abnormalities was generally similar for the 2 treatment arms, with 
neutropenia reported as the most common Grade 3/4 change in a haematological laboratory 
parameter. The blood chemistry parameters (ASAT, ALAT, total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, 
serum creatinine) were also similar (data not shown). No effect on proteinuria and haematuria was 
observed (data not shown). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A higher docetaxel dose used in clinical practice could lead to an increased toxicity in combination with 
trastuzumab SC. To address this issue the Applicant included annual comparisons on the combined use 
of trastuzumab SC with docetaxel 75 m/m2 and 100 mg/m2 to the post-marketing activity. 
A slight increased toxicity of the SC regimen in comparison with the standard intravenous regimen was 
observed. This was most evident in higher incidence rates of SAEs with a relatively larger difference in 
the adjuvant treatment phase. Most SAEs were identified by in-patient hospitalisation or prolongation 
of existing hospitalisation. The difference between arms was mainly driven by infectious events and is 
Herceptin

also  noted  for  cardiac  events  though  the  numbers  are  smaller.  In  addition  more  hypertensive  events 
and  a  higher  immunogenicity  (which  did  not  induce  adverse  reactions)  were  reported  for  the 
trastuzumab SC formulation in the pivotal study. Overall, the difference in SAE rates is not reflected by 
a difference in severe adverse events.  
In  the  trastuzumab  SC  arm  there  was  a  higher  incidence  AEs  suggestive  of  administration-related 
reactions (37.2% vs. 47.8% in the trastuzumab IV vs. trastuzumab SC arm, respectively; clinical cut-
off date of July 2012) mainly due to erythema and  cough. Taking the different pharmacokinetics into 
account, a later onset of ARRs could be theoretically hypothesized for the SC formulation, thus possibly 
requiring a longer observation period. To clarify this issue, the time to onset of administration-related 
reactions will be evaluated in the ongoing SC SID cohort of study SafeHer (see RMP). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Study  B022227  demonstrated  a  safety  profile  for  Trastuzumab  SC  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile for trastuzumab IV with no new safety findings, but higher rates of some AEs were observed in 
the trastuzumab SC arm compared to the trastuzumab IV arm, however no definite conclusions were 
made as to whether this is a true safety difference between the formulations and more information will 
be  provided  through  additional  follow-up  as  agreed  in  the  RMP.  All  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in 
clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC agreed by consensus that the risk management system for trastuzumab (Herceptin) is 
acceptable. The following points should be considered in the next revision of the RMP to be submitted 
together with the next PSUR:  
o  The PRAC recommendation for a Phase IV clinical trial concerning safety of 100 mg/m2 
docetaxel and sc Herceptin in patients with metastatic breast cancer with specific focus on 
active cardiac monitoring. 
o  The RMP needs to be revised with the presentation of data on overdose for trastuzumab IV 
versus trastuzumab SC. 
o  To allow more comprehensive comparison with clinical trial data post-marketing data should be 
presented as reporting rate, using the frequency from number of concerned events and the 
number of total events as numerator and denominator. 
o  Clear milestones should be provided by the company for some studies mentioned in the 
Pharmacovigilance Plan of the RMP. At the moment there are unclear dates present (e.g. 
H4613g (HER-Q-Les) ‘circa 2013’, and for ML20529 no dates at all) 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 62/70 
 
 
 
 
In future PSURs the following should be taken into account: 
o  The analyses of safety of docetacel 75mg/m2 versus 100mg/m2 should be presented with each 
PSUR. 
o  Metastatic dissemination should undergo further close monitoring and evaluation with 
comparison of the data for IV and SC formulation administered 
Trastuzumab is currently licensed for use in HER2-positive:  
• 
Early breast cancer (EBC): 
o  As neoadjuvant-adjuvant therapy (in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 
followed by trastuzumab monotherapy for a total duration of 1 year). 
In combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
o 
o  Following surgery, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, if 
applicable. 
•  Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) 
o  As monotherapy or  
o 
In combination with paclitaxel, docetaxel or an aromatase inhibitor. 
•  Metastatic gastric cancer  
o 
In combination with chemotherapy.   
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The CHMP endorsed this advice, however it was considered that the requested Phase IV clinical trial 
with specific focus on active cardiac monitoring should be uncontrolled with an open choice of the dose 
of docetaxel. The protocol of the trial will be discussed with the MAH and agreed in the next RMP 
update. 
2.8.  User consultation 
The applicant will submit the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet that meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use prior to placing the product on the market. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The present application provides data to support the license extension of the trastuzumab SC (vial) 
formulation (Herceptin SC) as a fixed dose (600 mg) for three-weekly assisted administration via a 
handheld syringe. The SC administration of trastuzumab is enabled by the use of recombinant human 
hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), a key excipient in the trastuzumab SC formulation which acts as a 
permeation enhancer. This application is based on data from one phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) dose-
finding and dose-confirmation study (BP22023) and one pivotal, phase III clinical study (BO22227) in 
patients with EBC in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting. 
The  phase  I  study  aimed  at  identifying  a  SC  trastuzumab  dose  for  a  q3w  regimen  which  allowed  for 
drug  exposure  comparable  to  the  licensed  q3w  IV  regimen  (loading  dose  of  8  mg/kg,  maintenance 
dose 6 mg/kg q3w). Based on modeling and simulation of data from study BP22023, the fixed dose of 
600 mg q3w was determined for the trastuzumab SC formulation that subsequently was investigated in 
the phase III pivotal study.  
The  primary  analysis  of  the  phase  III  study  (EPP  analysis  set)  allows  to  conclude  non-inferiority  of 
trastuzumab SC compared to trastuzumab IV in terms of the primary endpoints pCR, which was 45.4% 
(95% CI: 39.2%, 51.7%) vs. 40.7% (95% CI: 34.7%, 46.9%), and the co-primary endpoint Ctrough 
pre-dose  Cycle  8,  which  was  78.7  µg/mL  vs.  57.8  µg/mL  for  trastuzumab  SC  vs.  trastuzumab  IV 
respectively. The results were consistent with secondary analyses of secondary endpoints (tpCR, EFS, 
AUC) and analyses based on the ITT set. 
The study  was conducted in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment setting in patients with early breast 
cancer  with  the  efficacy  assessment  after  the  end  of  the  neoadjuvant  treatment.  Extrapolation  of 
efficacy is considered acceptable (regarding safety in MBC see Risks, below). The treatment of patients 
with gastric cancer is not within the scope of this line extension. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The choice of pCR as primary efficacy endpoint is generally acceptable but pCR can only be considered 
a surrogate parameter and non-inferiority in terms of pCR should be supported by long-term outcome 
data.  The  2-year  EFS  of  .82  (.76;  .87)  in  the  trastuzumab  IV  arm  and  .83  (.78;  .89)  in  the 
Herceptin 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 66/70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trastuzumab  SC  arm  (EPP)  provide  support  to  the  conclusion  of  non-inferiority  in  efficacy  (median 
follow-up  of  about  20.7  months;  clinical  cut-off  date  of  9  July  2012).    As  set  out  in  the 
pharmacovigilance plan, the Applicant will submit more complete follow-up data on EFS and OS once 
the  last  patient  has  completed  the  24  months  follow-up  period  and  will  present  the  final  analysis 
including  efficacy  once  the  last  patient  has  completed  the  60  months  follow-up  period,  to  further 
confirm long-term outcome. 
A higher rate of anti-drug antibodies against trastuzumab was observed for the SC formulation 
compared to trastuzumab IV. However, a very low incidence of neutralizing antibodies is reassuring 
(one patient treated with the IV formulation and two patients treated with the SC formulation). In 
addition antibodies were not associated with adverse reactions. The applicant will provide follow-up 
data from immunogenicity analyses on anti-trastuzumab and anti-rHuPH2 antibodies as part of the 
BO22227 Annual Report to be submitted with the March Data Lock Point (DLP) Herceptin PSUR. 
The Applicant will submit the final study reports data for the clinical studies B022227, PrefHer and 
SafeHer, including immunogenicity, when available. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Trastuzumab SC safety profile was consistent with the known safety profile for trastuzumab IV with no 
new safety findings, but higher rates of some AEs were observed in the trastuzumab SC arm compared 
to the trastuzumab IV arm. This included higher rate of SAEs (14.1% vs. 21.5%), SAEs not completely 
resolved (7.3% vs. 17.2% of SAEs in 1.3% vs 3.7% of patients); higher rate of treatment withdrawals 
for safety reasons (2.7% vs. 5.7%), higher rate of events in SOCs infections, higher rate of AE leading 
to  death  (2  vs.  4  patients),  and  higher  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  cardiac  AEs  (1.0%  vs.  1.7%),  cardiac 
SAEs (0.7% vs. 1.7%), and higher withdrawals due to symptomatic LVEF decrease (0 vs. 2 patients). 
The  difference  in  the  safety  profile  of  both  trastuzumab  formulations  was  more  pronounced  in  the 
adjuvant  treatment  phase.  It  cannot  be  concluded  with  certainty  whether  the  difference  in  the  SAE 
profile between both treatment arms is due to a true safety difference between the formulations or is 
rather a bias due to the open-label study or mainly due to chance. All the adverse reactions reported in 
clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
A  higher  rate  of  cardiac  toxicity  has  been  reported  in  MBC  compared  with  EBC  patients  receiving 
trastuzumab IV (most likely due to prior exposure to anthracyclines). In this context it was discussed 
whether the  safety data of trastuzumab SC in the neoadjuvant setting are completely transferable to 
the  metastastic  breast  cancer  setting.  The  Applicant  will  provide  a  proposal  for  a  phase  IV  safety 
clinical trial with prospective cardiac monitoring in patients with MBC to address this issue. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  follow-up-period  for  Study  B022227  has  been  extended  to  5  years  and  Annual  Reports  of  Study 
BO22227 will be provided. 
The MAH selected a lower docetaxel dose of 75m/m² in view of patient tolerability, as higher doses are 
associated with increased rates of neutropenic fever. No data have been provided for the treatment of 
trastuzumab SC with standard dose of chemotherapy, so a further increase in toxicity can be expected 
in  combination  with  a  higher  dose  chemotherapy  backbone.  To  address  this  issue  Annual  Reports 
comparing trastuzumab SC plus 75 mg/m² docetaxel with trastuzumab SC plus 100 mg/m² docetaxel 
have  been  included  as  a  pharmacovigilance  measure  for  this  Missing  Information  in  the  Risk 
Management Plan.

A  higher  rate  of  cardiac  toxicity  has  been  reported  in  MBC  compared  with  EBC  patients  receiving 
trastuzumab  IV  (most  likely  due  to  prior  exposure  to  anthracyclines).  In  this  context  it  could  be 
discussed  whether  the  safety  data  of  trastuzumab  SC  in  the  neoadjuvant  setting  are  completely 
transferable to the metastastic breast cancer setting. The Applicant will provide a proposal for a phase 
IV clinical safety study with prospective cardiac monitoring in patients with MBC to address this issue. 
The applicant will provide follow-up data from immunogenicity analyses on anti-trastuzumab and anti-
rHuPH2  antibodies  as  part  of  the  BO22227  Annual  Report  to  be  submitted  with  the  March  Data  Lock 
Point (DLP) Herceptin PSUR. 
Limited  information  is  available  regarding  switching  patients  between  both  trastuzumab  formulations. 
A  further  risk  associated  with  the  switch  from  SC  to  IV  application  is  related  to  the  higher  Ctrough 
levels  reached  during  SC  administration.  Subsequent  IV  infusion  will  lead  to  a  very  high  Cmax  level 
resulting from addition to the high pre-dose Ctrough. However limited safety data from the first interim 
analysis of Study M0222982 PrefHER did not reveal a clinical safety signal so far (data not shown). The 
lack of sufficient data is reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Compared  to  IV  administration,  SC  administration  may  have  advantages  in  terms  of  shorter 
administration time (2-5 minutes) and alternative route of administration, particularly for trastuzumab 
monotherapy  (e.g.,  during  adjuvant  treatment).  A  fixed  subcutaneous  dose  independent  of  the 
patient´s weight and without a loading dose simplifies the dose regimen. The risk of medication errors 
relating to accidentally wrong doses is expected to be reduced compared to a weight-based dosing.  
Trastuzumab SC was associated with a slightly higher incidence of AE for some adverse events like 
SAEs, infections, AE leading to death, cardiac AEs and AEs leading to treatment withdrawals for safety 
reasons in the trastuzumab SC arm. However, the differences were small, often based on rare events, 
and may be at least in part due to bias and chance.  Exploratory analyses did not reveal an association 
between toxicity and exposure. Although the incidence of SAEs was higher for trastuzumab SC, the 
incidence of severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs was similar in both treatment groups.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy in term of antitumor response (pCR) was  considered at least non-inferior to the trastuzumab 
IV formulation. The expected benefit of the greater convenience of the SC treatment has to be weighed 
against the risk of exposing the patients to a drug with a potentially worse safety profile. The benefit is 
particularly relevant in the adjuvant treatment phase, when the patients are not bound any longer to 
the  burden  of  chemotherapy,  and  counter-balances  the  slightly  higher  toxicity  observed  with  the  SC 
regimen. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The study  was conducted in the neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment setting in patients with early breast 
cancer  with  the  efficacy  assessment  after  the  end  of  the  neoadjuvant  treatment.  This  is  a  licensed 
indication  for  trastuzumab  IV  and  the  rationale  for the  choice  of  this  patient  population  is  considered 
acceptable. Extrapolation of efficacy to the metastatic breast cancer setting is considered acceptable. 
The treatment of patients with gastric cancer is not within the scope of this line extension.

- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least an 
anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone receptor 
positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these 
treatments.

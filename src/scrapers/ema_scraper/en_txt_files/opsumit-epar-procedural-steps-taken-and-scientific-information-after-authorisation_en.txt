Opus Registry (AC-055-503) is a multicenter, prospective, 
remove a sentence and a warning on the limited 
clinical experience in patients over the age of 75 
years, following the recommendation of the 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010115/202010 procedure to 
remove ‘Elderly patients’ as missing information in 
the RMP. The Package Leaflet is being updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took this 
opportunity to update the Package Leaflet to include 
section on Male fertility and align it with the currently 
approved information in SmPC, sections 4.6 Fertility, 
long-term, longitudinal, real-world, observational drug 
registry of new users of Opsumit conducted in the US to 
further characterize the safety profile in clinical practice 
and to describe clinical outcomes in the postmarketing 
setting, which included data from 374 patients aged ≥ 75 
years (2264 in the PAH set), was submitted supported by 
an additional data of subgroups by age from previously 
submitted clinical trials. The effectiveness outcomes in the 
Opus study were hospitalization and death, and safety 
outcomes were adverse events (AE), hepatic AE, hepatic AE

of special interest and reason for discontinuation. In the 
elderly subset, 180 patients were hospitalized at least once, 
and 173 of them were hospitalized due to an AE (dyspnoea, 
pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, respiratory failure or 
hypoxia). There were no relevant differences between the 
elderly subset and the PAH set related to the first 
hospitalization and death. The KM survival estimates were 
82.3% (95% CLs: 77.1, 86.4) at 1 year and 69.3% (95% 
CLs: 62.3, 75.2) at 2 years (89.5% (95% CLs: 87.9, 90.8) 
at 1 year and 81.0% (95% CLs: 78.8, 83.0) at 2 years in 
the PAH set). The exposure-adjusted event rate per 100 
persons-years was higher in the elderly subset (17.10 vs 
10.19). The rate of death was higher in the elderly subset, 
which is in line with the higher mortality in this group of 
patients ≥75 years. No significant differences in the 
effectiveness and safety profile have been observed in 
elderly aged 75 and over.

Of the 742 patients who participated in the pivotal 
long-term follow-up data from SERAPHIN open-label 
(OL) study. SERAPHIN OL study was a long-term 
single-arm open-label extension study of the 
SERAPHIN double-blind (DB) study, to assess the 
safety and tolerability of macitentan in patients with 
symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) 
that have completed the DB study or that 
experienced a morbidity event and for who a written 
approval to roll over into the OL study was obtained 
by the sponsor.

SERAPHIN double-blind study, 550 patients entered a long-

included 182 patients who continued on macitentan 10 mg 
and 368 patients who received placebo or macitentan 3 mg 
and crossed over to macitentan 10 mg. Long-term follow-
up of these 550 patients  for a median exposure of  3.3 
years and a maximum exposure of  10.9 years showed a 
safety profile that was consistent as during the SERAPHIN 
double-blind phase. 
In long-term follow-up of 242 patients who were treated 
with macitentan 10 mg in the double-blind (DB) phase of

active metabolite, with minor contribution from CYP2C8, 
and CYP2C9 based on results from a non-clnical 
study and a physiologically based pharmacokinetic 
study in healthy subjects and CYP2C9 poor 
metabolizers; the Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet and to make editorial changes 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 enzymes.  
Caution should be exercised when macitentan is 
administered concomitantly with moderate dual inhibitors 
of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 (e.g., fluconazole and amiodarone). 
In the presence of fluconazole 400 mg daily, a moderate 
dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, exposure to 
macitentan may increase approximately 3.8-fold based on

PBPK modelling. However, there was no clinically relevant 
change in exposure to the active metabolite of macitentan. 
The uncertainties of such modelling should be considered.  
Caution should also be exercised when macitentan is 
administered concomitantly with both a moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitor (e.g., ciprofloxacin, cyclosporine, diltiazem, 
erythromycin, verapamil) and moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor 
(e.g., miconazole, piperine).

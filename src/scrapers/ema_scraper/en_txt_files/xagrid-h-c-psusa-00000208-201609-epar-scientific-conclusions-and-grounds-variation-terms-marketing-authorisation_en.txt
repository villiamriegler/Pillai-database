Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for anagrelide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During  the  reporting  period,  nine  new  cases  were  retrieved  through  the  search  with  the  SMQ  for 
pulmonary  hypertension,  all  serious.  Pulmonary  hypertension  is  part  of  the  known  safety  profile  for 
anagrelide, currently listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC as a ‘rare’ adverse reaction.  
Based  on  the  updated  total  of  35  cases  of  pulmonary  hypertension  retrieved  from  the  clinical  trials 
cumulatively,  all  assessed  as  unrelated 
to 
the  underlying 
treated  disease  of  essential 
thrombocythaemia,  the  reporting  frequency  for  pulmonary  hypertension  from  evaluable  clinical  trials 
was  recalculated  as  35/5578  =  0.0063  (0.63%),  which  corresponds  to  an  ‘uncommon’  event. 
Considering  the  nine  new  cases  suggesting  a  causal  relationship  with  anagrelide  together  with  the 
recalculated  reporting  frequency,  a  change  in  frequency  from  ‘rare’  to  ‘uncommon’  is  considered 
appropriate. The change should be implemented accordingly in the package leaflet. 
Moreover,  these  new  cases  and  the  higher  frequency  of  occurrence  also  raise  the  need  for  further 
information to be provided in section 4.4 of the SmPC, in order to alert healthcare professionals to this 
serious  adverse  reaction  and  the  need  for  close  monitoring  of  the  patients  for  any  symptom  of 
pulmonary  hypertension,  including  in  patients  with a  medical  history  of  pulmonary  hypertension.  The 
package leaflet should be updated accordingly. 
As Xagrid and Thromboreductin contain the same active substance, with similar therapeutic schemes, 
the safety profile for this risk is expected to be similar, despite lower reporting with Thromboreductin 
and the PRAC therefore considered that the changes to the product information should be implemented 
for both products. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for anagrelide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing anagrelide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal tumours. There are more 
than 50 histologic subtypes of STS, many of which are associated with distinct clinical profiles, response 
to individual therapies and prognosis. Many of the individual subtypes are very rare. In the past, all 
subtypes of STS were grouped together for the purposes of treatment, however consensus is now 
emerging that treatment selection should be governed by histology, particularly in the setting of 
advanced disease. Soft tissue sarcomas account for less than 1% of all adult solid tumours (Burningham, 
et al., 2012) and the international annual incidence of STS is reported to range from 1.8 to 5/100 000 per 
year (Wibmer, et al., 2010). It was estimated that 12 020 new cases of STS would be reported in the US 
in 2014 and 4 740 deaths would occur as a result of the disease (Siegel, et al., 2014). In the EU, the total 
crude incidence of sarcomas was 5.6 per 100,000 per year with an estimated 27,908 new cases per year, 
of which 84% were soft tissue sarcomas and 14% were bone sarcomas (Stiller et al, 2013). The 5-year 
survival in Europe for adult STS (excluding visceral STS) averages 60%, with substantial geographic

variations (Storm, 1998). The median survival time in patients with metastatic STS is 11 to 15 months, 
and only a small subgroup of these patients achieve long term survival. With the median survival of ≤ 1 
year for patients with metastatic STS, there is a need for more effective treatments in this setting 
(Billingsley, et al., 1999; Van Glabbeke, et al., 1999). 
For localised disease, surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiotherapy is usually the preferred 
first-line approach.  Adjuvant chemotherapy is also sometimes considered although its role remains 
controversial because of conflicting results (ESMO guideline 2014).  However even when radical surgery is 
performed, in about 50% of the time, cases of high-grade sarcoma develop metastases which lead to 
death (Delaney et al., 1991).  
For advanced STS, the majority of patients receive 1st line chemotherapy with doxorubicin alone or in 
combination with ifosfamide. Of those patients receiving adjuvant or first-line chemotherapy, 
approximately half will receive a second-line regimen (Minchom, 2010). At the time of the study, options 
for second line therapy included the use of standard-dose ifosfamide (or high-dose ifosfamide in patients 
who have already received standard dose (Minchom, 2010), trabectedin, and gemcitabine (either alone or 
in combination with docetaxel), dacarbazine, or best supportive care (ESMO clinical practice guideline, 
2014). Since the start of the study, pazopanib has been approved in EU on 3 August 2012 for the 
treatment of patients with advanced STS of selected tumour types, who have received prior 
chemotherapy. However none of these agents has as yet demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in overall survival. Recently a study comparing trabectedin (Yondelis) to dacarbazine in 
pretreated locally advanced/metastatic liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma patients failed to demonstrate an 
OS benefit (Demetri et al, 2015). 
About the product 
Eribulin mesylate (Halaven) is a synthetic analog of halichondrin B (HalB), a large polyether macrolide 
isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai (Hirata and Uemura, 1986). Results of in vitro 
studies demonstrate that eribulin inhibits cell growth in a wide range of established human cancer cell 
lines including breast, colon, prostate, ovarian, small cell and non-small cell lung cancer and uterine 
sarcoma. Eribulin exerts its anti-cancer effects via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism, leading to 
G2/M (GAP 2/mitosis stages of cell cycle) cell cycle blocks, disruption of mitotic spindles and ultimately 
apoptotic cell death. 
In the European Union, Halaven is approved for the following indication:  
“HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease (see section 
5.1). Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or 
metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments.” 
The MAH has now applied for an extension of the indication to include:  
“HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of patients with inoperable soft tissue sarcoma (STS) who 
have received prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1). Efficacy and 
safety have been established primarily in patients with leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma.” 
To substantiate this claim, the MAH has submitted one pivotal Phase III study (study 309) and two 
supportive Phase II studies (studies 207 and 217). 
The final approved indication further to the CHMP review is: 
“HALAVEN is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma who have 
received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease 
(see section 5.1).”

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
To evaluate the primary pharmacodynamic effects of eribulin mesilate in nonclinical models of human soft 
tissue sarcoma (STS), the following in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted. 
• Antiproliferative activity against human adult and paediatric sarcoma cells (in vitro) 
• Antitumor activity in human adult and paediatric sarcoma xenograft models (in vivo) 
In vitro studies 
As a part of the Paediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) supported by the US National Cancer 
Institute (NCI), antiproliferative effects of eribulin mesilate against 10 childhood STS cell lines including 4 
rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), 2 rhabdoid, and 4 Ewing’s sarcomas were evaluated. The median half 
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of eribulin mesilate in these 3 types of STS cell lines were 
0.14, 0.27, and 0.14 nmol/L, respectively. Another panel of 20 human childhood Ewing’s sarcoma cell 
lines demonstrated a median IC50 value of 0.38 nmol/L. Eribulin mesilate inhibited the proliferation of the 
MES-SA human uterine sarcoma cell line with an IC50 value of 1.99 nmol/L. 
In vivo studies 
Antitumor activity of eribulin mesilate against nonclinical models of human STS was evaluated in SK-LMS-
1 (human leiomyosarcoma), A673 (human Ewing’s sarcoma), and HT-1080 (human fibrosarcoma) 
xenograft models grown subcutaneously in athymic mice. In the SK-LMS-1 model, eribulin mesilate (0.19 
– 1.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth at 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg. In the A673 and HT-1080 
models, eribulin mesilate (0.875 – 3.5 mg/kg for A673, 1.27 and 1.69 mg/kg for HT-1080) almost 
completely inhibited tumour growth, with complete responses (CRs) observed in some mice. 
In the PPTP evaluation, eribulin mesilate (1 mg/kg) administration resulted in a CR or maintained 
complete response (MCR) against 8 of the 11 human STS xenograft models; the CRs/MCRs were found in 
4 of the 5 Ewing’s sarcoma and 4 of the 4 RMS xenograft models. In dose-response studies in 4 selected 
xenograft models of Ewing’s sarcoma and RMS, eribulin mesilate (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) was active 
against 3 of the 4 models, with MCRs and CRs observed at doses ≥0.25 or ≥0.5 mg/kg. The treatments 
were well tolerated in all mice in all of the xenograft studies. 
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Using a worst-case combined refined Fpen value of 0.000088 for breast cancer and STS (based on EU 
epidemiological data for all breast cancer and STS patients, maximum dose of 2.2 mg and maximum 
possible number of treatment cycles, 17 per year for all patients), the overall PECSURFACEWATER value 
for eribulin has been calculated to be 0.000097 μg/L. This value is >100 times lower than the action limit 
of 0.01 μg/L. 
The log Kow of eribulin mesilate is 2.25, such that it does not present a hazard with respect to 
bioaccumulation and persistence. Therefore, the drug substance, eribulin mesilate, is not classifiable as a 
Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) substance. 
A Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment is not necessary for HALAVEN 0.44 mg/mL Solution 
for Injection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 8/92 
 
  
  
Despite there being no environmental trigger for further environmental testing, 3 studies have been 
performed using eribulin mesilate: 
•  Acute toxicity study using Daphnia magna (OECD 202) NOEC=0.46 mg/l 
•  Activated sewage sludge respiration inhibition test (OECD 209) NOEC = 56 mg/l 
•  Ready biodegradability test (OECD 301B) Not readily biodegradable (7-8%) 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has presented in vitro data showing antiproliferative activity against the human uterine sarcoma 
cell line MES-SA with an IC50 of 1.99 nmol/l. In a xenograft model in athymic mice, eribulin mesilate 
showed antitumor activity against the human leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1. 
These in vitro and in vivo data support the clinical development of eribulin mesilate in the treatment of 
soft tissue sarcoma.  
With regard to the ERA, it is agreed that no further Phase II testing is required, as a consequence of 
introducing a new indication. Although eribulin mesilate was shown not to be readily biodegradable, due 
to the very low anticipated exposure it is unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted support this application for an extension of indication. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of eribulin mesilate. Considering the above data, eribulin mesilate is not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
New plasma concentration data are available from the two phase II studies (207 and 217) and from the 
phase III study (309) of eribulin in the treatment of advanced STS. In study 207, PK sampling was 
performed on Day 1 in cycle 1 only. In studies 217 and 309, PK sampling was performed on Day 1 and 8 
in cycles 1 and 3. The pharmacokinetic data was used to perform two new Population PK and PK/PD 
analyses. The first analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-003R) included data from Study 207 pooled with 
data from 7 previous Phase 1 studies (Studies 101, 102, 103, 105, 108, 109, and 110) and one previous 
Phase 2 Study (Study 211). The second analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-005R) included also data from 
the STS studies 217 and 309.  
The results of the first analysis (Report No CPMS-E7389-003R), including STS data from study 207 only, 
were in line with previous population PK analyses of eribulin and are not further discussed. The results 
from the analysis including data from all STS studies (207, 217 and 309) are described below.  
In addition, the MAH submitted a number of new in vitro studies on protein binding, interaction potential, 
and transporter substrate specificity. 
2.3.2.1.  Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
The final population analyses included 478 subjects who contributed a total of 4566 eribulin plasma 
concentrations (1753 observations from 253 subjects from Studies 101, 102, 105, 108, 109, 110, and 
207 and 1753 observations from 253 subjects from Studies 217 and 309). 
Model-based analyses consisted of a population PK model for eribulin and population PK/PD models for 
longitudinal tumour size measurements (depending on any apparent eribulin exposure PK/PD

relationship), neutropenia and change from baseline in QTcF. All models were developed using NONMEM 
7.2. Model building and covariate assessments were conducted using standard methods. 
The final population PK model was used to derive individual PK parameters and eribulin exposures, which 
were then incorporated into the PK/PD datasets to be used in the subsequent population PK/PD analyses. 
The results from this population PK analysis were consistent with those from previous analyses. The PK of 
eribulin were best described by a three compartment model with linear elimination from the central 
compartment and parameterized for CL, V1, Q2, V2, Q3 and V3. The use of an allometric model with 
body weight, used in a previous eribulin PK analysis, was also used in this case. The IIV was estimated 
for CL, V1, Q2 and V3, but not for volume of distribution for V2 and inter-compartmental clearance for 
the 2nd and 3rd compartments (Q2). Residual variability was described by a proportional error model and 
estimated separately for data rich Phase 1 studies and for sparse data in the Phase 2/3 studies and for 
the maximum duration of infusion period (≤1.5 h). 
Eribulin CL was found to increase with increasing albumin levels (power = 0.693) and decline with 
increasing bilirubin (power = -0.129). No significant effect of gender, age, race, ECOG status, renal 
function (creatinine clearance) or tumour type (STS vs. others) on eribulin exposure was identified. Model 
parameters are presented in the table below.

2.3.2.2.  New in vitro studies using human biomaterial 
Study B2012-002: In vitro protein binding of eribulin in human plasma 
Blank plasma aliquots from volunteers were spiked with eribulin (E7389) to achieve final concentrations 
of 5, 50, and 500 ng/mL. Plasma samples were spiked into the membrane side of Rapid Equilibrium 
Devices (RED). Phosphate buffer solution was spiked into the outer well of the RED. After an overnight 
incubation, an aliquot was removed from each side of the membrane. The resulting samples were 
extracted and concentrations of eribulin were determined by LC/MS/MS. The percentage of protein 
binding in plasma was determined by comparing the concentrations calculated from each side of the 
membrane. 
The protein binding of eribulin (5, 50 and 500 ng/mL) in human plasma was 61.6%, 67.4% and 63.8%, 
respectively. There was no concentration dependency. 
Study 301054911: Eribulin induction potential on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 
Eribulin was incubated in three separate preparations of human hepatocyte cultures at concentrations of 
1, 5 and 10 μM for three days. Hepatocytes were also incubated with positive controls, β-naphthoflavone 
(20 μM) for CYP1A1/2, phenobarbital (2 mM) for CYP2B6 and rifampicin (20 μM) for CYP2C9 and 3A4. The 
enzyme induction was determined using probe substrates selective for these drug-metabolizing enzymes 
and quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA expression. The cytotoxicity potential of eribulin towards hepatocyte 
cultures was tested using a MTT assay at the end of the 3-day exposure period. 
The positive control inducers produced at least 12-fold increase in the enzyme activities for CYP1A2, 
CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in all three donors. As expected, the induction in CYP2C9 activity by rifampicin was 
relatively low (2.8-9.1-fold). 
Eribulin caused no induction for all enzymes tested. Instead, a decrease in enzyme activities was found 
for all three donors, with a maximal decrease at 10 μM of 32-77%. The RT-PCR data generally supported 
the activity results. The cytotoxicity assessment using the MTT assay showed no obvious decrease in 
hepatocyte viability in cultures of hepatocytes for all donors at any of concentrations examined (1, 5 and 
10 μM).  
Study 2010-003: Eribulin inhibition of select CYPs in microsomes 
Co-incubation of probe substrates at their respective Km values and multiple eribulin concentrations (up 
to 200 μM) in human liver microsomes (HLM) was utilized to create IC50 curves. The P450s explored 
were CYP1A, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A. Positive controls utilising 
probe inhibitors was also assessed to verify the validity of the incubations. 
For all P450s except CYP3A, the IC50 values for inhibition by eribulin were greater than 200 μM. For 
CYP3A, the IC50 values for inhibition by eribulin against the probe substrates of midazolam, nifedipine, 
and testosterone were 2.21, 1.17, and 10.6 μM, respectively.

Study 2013-121: Eribulin as a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 and MATE, and 
as inhibitor of MATE 
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if eribulin was a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, 
OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1, and inhibitor of MATE1. For the substrate assays, eribulin (0.3, 1, 
or 3 μmol/L) was co–incubated in transfected Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO), Human Embryonic Kidney 
(HEK) or MDCKII cells overexpressing OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1 with or 
without a selective transporter inhibitor. The parental cells were used as the control. Following the 
incubation, eribulin concentrations in cell lysates were analysed using LC/MS/MS. For the evaluation of 
inhibition, eribulin was co–incubated in transfected and parental cells overexpressing MATE1 with probe 
substrate [14C]–metformin. The amount of the probe substrate in cell lysates was analyzed using a liquid 
scintillation counter. Transporter mediated uptake was represented by the difference in fold uptake in the 
transporter expressing cells and the parental cells. 
At concentrations ranging from 0.3–1 μmol/L of eribulin, generally less than two-fold uptake of eribulin 
was observed in transfected cells compared to those in the parental cells. In addition, the fold increase in 
each transfected cell was not significantly reduced in the presence of selective inhibitor. Active transport 
was demonstrated by uptake of the model substrates, which was inhibited by the control inhibitors.

The results from the inhibition study suggest that up to 10 μmol/L of eribulin did not inhibit the MATE1– 
mediated transport of the probe substrate. 
Study 2013-139: Eribulin as a substrate of BCRP, MRP2, MRP4 and BSEP 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate eribulin at lower concentrations as a potential substrate of 
BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP.  
For the BCRP substrate assays, the transcellular transport of eribulin at 0.3 and 1 μmol/L in the absence 
or presence of a BCRP inhibitor (KO 143) was measured in transwell inserts using BCRP-transfected 
(MDCKII-BCRP) cells and parental cells. Flux ratio (FR) was defined as the ratio of the apparent 
permeability coefficient (Papp) in basolateral-to-apical (BA) direction to that of apical-to-basolateral (A-B) 
direction. The FR was normalized by the parental cells, expressed as the corrected flux ratio (CFR). KO 
143 was co-incubated with eribulin to determine if CFR values decreased.  
Eribulin was assessed as a substrate of MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP using vesicle membrane assays. Eribulin 
at 0.3 and 1 μmol/L was incubated in the transporter-enriched vesicle membranes and the control vesicle 
membranes. The ATP/AMP ratios were calculated to assess the ATP dependent transport. Transporter 
inhibitors (benzbromarone, MK 571, and cyclosporin A for MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP, respectively) was co-
treated with eribulin to determine if ATP/AMP ratios decreased. 
In the BCRP substrate assay, the corrected flux ratio (CFR) values for 0.3 and 1 μmol/L of eribulin were 
0.8 and 0.9, respectively. The respective CFR values for eribulin were 0.8 and 0.3 in the presence of KO 
143, i.e. there was no substantial reduction of eribulin transport in presence of inhibitor (Table ). The CFR 
for [3H]prazosin, a known BCRP substrate, was 4.1 and 1.0 in the absence and presence of KO 143, a 
known BCRP inhibitor, respectively, indicating that the BCRP activity in MDCKII-BCRP was substantially 
greater than that in MDCKII-mock cells and the activity was blocked by cotreating with a BCRP inhibitor.  
In the MRP2, MRP4, and BSEP substrate assays, almost all the ATP/AMP ratios of eribulin treatments in 
the transporter enriched vesicle membranes were less than 2 fold and the co-treatment of transporter 
inhibitors did not decrease the ATP/AMP ratios of eribulin (Table 7). Results with model substrates 
([3H]E17βG for MRP2, [3H]DHEAS for MRP4, and [3H]taurocholate for BSEP) indicated transporter 
activity in the transfected vesicles but not in control vesicles.

This study investigated if eribulin was an inhibitor and/or substrate of MRP2, MRP4, BSEP, OATP1B3, 
OCT1 and OCT2 by measuring its inhibition of model substrates and transport, respectively, in membrane 
vesicles or transfected cells. MRP2, MRP4 and BSEP were investigated in membrane vesicles and

Table 10: Accumulation of eribulin in OATP1B3 Expressing and Control Cells Measured in the Uptake 
Transporter Substrate Feasibility Assay 
Based on the data presented above, eribulin is not a clinically relevant inhibitor of any of the investigated 
transporters (based on the 50*Cmax(u) cut-off of 8.5 µM). Eribulin seems to be a weak substrate of 
OATP1B3. However, the known OATP1B3 inhibitor fluvastatin did not inhibit the uptake of eribulin. Taken 
together, the modest OATP1B3 accumulation (1.4-2.16 fold) and the lack of fluvastatin inhibition of 
eribulin OATP1B3 uptake clearly indicates that eribulin is actually not a substrate of OATP1B3 in vitro. 
In conclusion, eribulin is neither an inhibitor nor a substrate of MRP2, MRP4, BSEP, OATP1B3, OCT1 and 
OCT2 in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations.

Study XS-0085: Eribulin as a substrate of BCRP, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 and OATP1B1 
The transcellular transport or cellular uptake of eribulin at 5 and 10 μmol/L was measured in BCRP, OAT1, 
OAT3, OATP1B1, and OCT1 expressing cells and respective control cells. The concentrations of eribulin in 
the samples were determined by LC/MS/MS. The Papp ratio, a parameter for assessing the efflux of 
BCRP, and R value, a Papp ratio normalized by control cells, were calculated to assess the BCRP 
susceptibility of eribulin. The cleared volume, a parameter for assessing cellular uptake, was used to 
evaluate the susceptibility of OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, and OCT1. The cellular uptake of eribulin was 
assessed by measuring the concentrations of eribulin in cell lysate. 
Efficient uptake of model substrates was observed, indicating functional transport in the cell systems.  
No uptake of eribulin by BCRP was observed. Although the cleared volumes of eribulin at 10 μmol/L in 
OAT1 expressing cells were significantly higher than the ones in the control cells, the difference was 
suggested mainly due to lower cleared volume of eribulin at 10 μmol/L observed in the control cells. The 
cleared volumes of eribulin at 10 μmol/L were similar to those at 5 μmol/L in the OAT1 expressing cells.  
Overall, the data indicate that eribulin is not a substrate of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, or OATP1B1. However, 
eribulin at 5 and 10 μmol/L exhibited higher cleared volumes in OCT1 expressing cells compared to those 
in the control cells, suggesting that eribulin may be an OCT1 substrate.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
The population PK/PD (exposure-efficacy) analysis for eribulin tumour growth inhibition, OS efficacy 
analysis and graphical eribulin exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy analysis were based on data from 
Studies 217 and 309. Time-to-event analysis for OS was performed for studies 217 and 309 separately. 
Due to the low number of patients in study 217, only results from study 309 will be discussed here. 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017

The population PK/PD (exposure-safety) analysis for eribulin-induced neutropenia was based on data 
from Studies 207, 217 and 309. The population PK/PD analysis for eribulin exposure-QTcF relationship 
was based on data from studies 217 and 309. 
In all three studies, the starting dose was 1.4 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle. 
Tumour growth inhibition model 
For the tumour growth inhibition model, data of the sum of the longest diameter for target lesions by 
independent review from Studies 217 and 309 was used. Subjects only for which both tumour size and PK 
information was available were evaluated. 
The final PK/PD study 217 and 309 dataset for tumour growth inhibition had 938 observations from 241 
subjects.  
The drug exposure parameter tested in the tumour growth inhibition model was individual eribulin AUC at 
the time of the assessment and was calculated as: 
where Dose is in μg on the day of tumour assessment and clearance in L/h is the population PK model 
predicted individual clearance. 
Tumour size appeared to decrease with time but not with increasing eribulin exposure.

OS analysis 
For study 309 out of the 226 subjects dosed with eribulin mesylate with available OS and PFS data, PK 
parameters to calculate eribulin exposure were available from 215 subjects. PFS week 12 data were 
available for 75 subjects. Time-to-event analysis for OS was performed on data from subjects in the 
eribulin arm. OS data was explored using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses using survfit() and 
coxph() functions, respectively in S-plus v 8.1. 
For the PK/PD analysis of OS, PFS and BOR the exposure parameter used was individual eribulin AUC 
based on the starting dose as for Tumour size above.  
The results from the univariate (p≤0.05) Cox regression analysis for the effect of eribulin exposure and 
other covariates on OS in study 309 (assessed in subjects receiving eribulin mesylate) are presented in 
the table below. Significant predictors are shown in bold type. 
Table 15: Study 309 univariate-OS relationship: Cox regression analysis results 
The significant predictors of OS from the above univariate analysis were identified to be loge % change 
tumor size at Week 6, ECOG status, years since diagnosed, and loge baseline tumour size. These 
predictors were carried forward to the multivariate analysis where all significant predictors for OS from 
the univariate analysis were assessed simultaneously. Multivariate Cox regression analysis (p≤0.01) 
results are presented in the table below.

A check for confounding between baseline tumour size with % change in tumour size at Week 6 was 
performed. Percentage change in tumour size at Week 6 was not confounded with baseline tumour size 
confirming the results of the multivariate.  
Neutropenia model 
For the neutropenia model, eribulin concentration at the time of ANC assessment was predicted using the 
final population PK model in all subjects participating in studies 207, 217 and 309 with post-dose ANC 
measurements. The PK/PD dataset for the neutropenia model development consisted of 6602 records 
from 402 subjects. 
Absolute neutrophil count data following eribulin mesilate administration in Studies 207, 217 and 309 was 
best described by a PK/PD model for haematological toxicity where model predicted eribulin 
concentrations reduced the neutrophil proliferation rate or induced cell loss. The results of the 
neutropenia PK/PD analyses for eribulin, including 24% greater inhibition of neutrophil proliferation in 
Japanese subjects, were consistent with previous analyses (Study 221). Parameters for the final eribulin 
neutropenia PK/PD model are presented in the table below.  
Table 17: Population parameter estimates for neutropenia final PKPD model 
QTcF model 
For the dQTcF model, observed eribulin concentrations during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 were used with post-
dose dQTcF measurements in studies 217 and 309. The PK/PD dataset for the QTcF model development 
consisted of 463 records from 127 subjects. 
The relationship between observed eribulin concentration and change from baseline QTcF (dQTcF) during 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 was assessed using the following linear relationship, where the slope of the 
relationship was estimated: 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 22/92 
 
  
  
 
The analysis showed that QTcF was not influenced by eribulin concentrations. 
Evaluation of safety parameters:  
No change in laboratory values for haematology, blood biochemistry and renal function with eribulin 
exposure was detected. Median cumulative eribulin exposure appears to be higher in subjects with AEs of 
Grade ≥3 compared to subjects not having these AEs. However, of the 253 subjects with PK and AE data, 
only 6 had Grade ≥3 neuropathy. No PK/PD relationship between average or cumulative eribulin exposure 
and occurrence of Grade ≥3 fatigue, nausea, anaemia and febrile neutropenia was observed. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The results of the new population pharmacokinetic analysis are fully in line with previous analyses. The 
data do not indicate a different pharmacokinetic behaviour of eribulin in patients with STS compared to 
patients with breast cancer. No changes to the pharmacokinetic information in the SmPC are therefore 
needed.  
The MAH submitted a number of new in vitro studies on protein binding and interaction potential. Protein 
binding results were in line with previous data and warrants no changes to the SmPC.  
The induction studies submitted with the original MAA had some flaws. Data were however considered 
sufficient to exclude a strong induction potential of eribulin and additional inductions studies were not 
requested by the CHMP. However, the MAH submitted further drug interaction studies. The new study 
investigating the eribulin induction potential on CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4 provides further reassurance. No 
changes to the SmPC are indicated. 
A CYP inhibition study previously not submitted indicated a potential of eribulin to inhibit CYP3A4. The 
results of this study have been discussed previously, as they were used in a Physiologically-based 
Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, submitted and discussed in variation EMEA/H/C/002084/II/011 (EC 
decision on 27 June 2014). The PBPK model indicated that an in vivo inhibitory potential on CYP3A4 
cannot be completely ruled out, although strong inhibition is not expected.  
Several studies on eribulin as a substrate and/or inhibitor of different transporters were submitted. 
Overall the study setups were acceptable. The investigations were somewhat overlapping and the results 
are summarised below.

Overall, eribulin appeared to be neither substrate nor inhibitor of the tested transporters. Eribulin has 
previously been concluded to be eliminated primarily via biliary excretion and the approved SmPC 
includes a general warning to avoid concomitant administration of inhibitors of transport proteins such as 
OATP or MRP. Based on the results of the new in vitro studies, indicating that eribulin is not a substrate of 
transporters known to be involved in drug-drug interactions, this warning has been removed.  
A previous DDI study with rifampicin showed no effect on eribulin exposure. However, as it was then 
unknown whether eribulin was an OATP substrate, it could not be absolutely excluded that an inducing 
effect of rifampicin was counteracted by OATP inhibition, and the results from the rifampicin study could 
not be extrapolated to other inducers. Therefore, a warning of a potential effect of CYP3A4 inducers on 
eribulin was included in the SmPC. Since eribulin has now been shown not to be a substrate of OATP 
transporters, this warning has been removed. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
An updated PPK model, with addition of data from Study 207, 217 and 309, and a new PK/PD model 
including data from study 301 only have been submitted. The updated PPK model does not alter the 
conclusion drawn on eribulin pharmacokinetics as compared with previous PPK models. Results of the 
PK/PD modelling are also in line with what has been previously observed and do not have implications for 
the benefit/risk assessment of the currently applied indication. 
New in vitro data on eribulin protein binding and on eribulin as an inducer of CYPs confirms previous 
results.  
New in vitro data indicate that eribulin is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP),

organic anion (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3), multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP2, MRP4) 
and bile salt export pump (BSEP) transporters. Neither has it inhibited BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter-mediated activity at relevant clinical concentrations. The SmPC has 
been updated in line with these results (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose response study has been submitted.  
Two phase II studies were conducted with eribulin in STS using the 1.4 mg/m2 of eribulin mesylate 
(please see section below on supportive studies). 
The eribulin dose regimen (1.4 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle) administered in study 
309 was established in the E7389-G000-305 study (EMBRACE) performed in metastatic breast cancer 
which constituted the basis for licensure for eribulin. The dose regimen is considered justified. 
It is to be noted that the dose 1.4 mg/m2 used in e.g. EMBRACE and the 309 study refers to the salt form 
(eribulin mesilate) which is equivalent to 1.23 mg/m2 of the base of the active substance (eribulin).  This 
is adequately highlighted in the Halaven SmPC section 4.2.

11. Any malignancy that required treatment or has shown evidence of recurrence (except for soft tissue 
sarcoma, non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix) during the 5 years prior to 
randomisation. 
12. Female subjects must not be pregnant as documented by a negative ß-hCG test with a minimum 
sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent unit of ß-hCG at Screening and Baseline, or breastfeeding. 
13. Hypersensitivity to either HalA or HalB chemical derivatives or both, or to dacarbazine or to any of the 
dacarbazine excipients (refer to the dacarbazine prescribing information). 
14. Any medical or other condition which, in the opinion of the PI or designee, will preclude participation 
in a clinical trial. 
Treatments 
Arm A:  Eribulin mesilate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 as an IV infusion over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 
of every 21-day cycle. 
Arm B:  Dacarbazine (DTIC), either 1200 mg/m2, 1000 mg/m2, or 850 mg/m2 (each administered once 
every 3 weeks ) as starting dose could be chosen at the discretion of the investigator depending on the 
individual clinical status of the patient at entry. The selection of the starting dose of dacarbazine for each 
subject had to be confirmed prior to randomization. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• OS measured from the date of randomisation until date of death from any cause. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documentation of disease

progression, or date of death (whichever occurs first). 
• PFR12wks, defined as the proportion of subjects alive and progression-free at 12 weeks from the date of 
randomisation. 
• CBR, defined as the proportion of subjects who had best overall response of CR or PR or dSD (duration 
> 11 weeks). 
• Safety endpoints included AEs according to CTCAE v4.0 grades and serious AEs, haematology and 
clinical chemistry, urinalysis, regular measurement of vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and performance of 
physical examinations. 
• Population PK profile of eribulin in the subjects with STS. 
Exploratory Endpoints 
• ORR, the proportion of subjects who had overall response of CR or PR. 
• DCR, the proportion of subjects who had best overall response of CR, or PR, or SD. 
• dSD, defined as the proportion of subjects who had the duration of SD ≥11 weeks. 
• QoL scores measured using the QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires. 
• The following exploratory PK/PD endpoints: 
- Relationship between exposure to eribulin and pharmacodynamic biomarkers and efficacy. 
- Relationship between exposure to eribulin and AEs. 
- Blood and tumour biomarkers which may be correlated with safety and efficacy endpoints. 
Sample size 
The sample size determination was estimated and based upon the required number of target events to 
detect a treatment difference in the comparison of OS. The estimated median OS of Arm B was assumed 
to be approximately 6 months, based on historical controls (Anderson et al., 2006). An improvement of 
2.5 months or more was considered to be of clinical importance, which translated to a median OS in Arm 
A of 8.5 months and a hazard ratio of 0.706. Alpha was set at 0.05 assuming a two-sided test and the 
power at 90%. The required number of deaths for the assumed effect size was projected to be 353 
events. It was estimated that approximately 450 subjects would need to be randomized and with a 
randomization ratio of 1:1 this would be a minimum of 225 subjects per treatment arm. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was conducted in a 1:1 ratio (Arm A, eribulin; Arm B, dacarbazine) and stratified by 
histology (ADI or LMS), region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 2: Western Europe, Australia and 
Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia), and number of prior regimens for advanced 
STS (2 or >2 prior regimens). 
Blinding (masking) 
Study 309 was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The study was designed to provide evidence to either support the null hypothesis: 
H0: Seribulin(t)=Sdacarbazine(t) (the survival distributions in the two arms are equal) or to reject it in 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 29/92 
 
  
  
favour of the alternative hypothesis: 
H1: Seribulin(t)≠Sdacarbazine(t) 
where Seribulin(t) is the survival function in the eribulin arm and Sdacarbazine(t) is the survival function 
in the dacarbazine arm. 
Stratified log-rank test was used to compare the primary efficacy endpoint OS between treatment arms 
on the Full Analysis Set. Subjects who were lost to follow-up and the subjects who were alive at the date 
of data cut-off were censored at either the date the subject was last known to be alive, or the date of 
data cut-off, whichever was earliest. Subjects who died on the date of randomization had a survival time 
of 0.5 day. The significance levels were as follows: 
• 0.0148 for the interim analysis when 70% of the target events have been observed, 
• 0.0455 for the final analysis. 
ECOG Performance Status (PS) were considered as additional stratification factors (0/1 vs. 2 or above) in 
primary analysis if baseline ECOG PS imbalance rate between two arms were more than 10%. 
Three sensitivity analyses were performed on the final primary analysis. 
• An analysis same as the final primary analysis but on per-protocol set. 
• An analysis similar to the final primary analysis except without any stratification. 
• Subjects starting new anti-cancer treatment were censored at the date of the new treatment 
Subgroup analyses, via stratified Cox proportional model, were performed by age (<65, or ≥65), sex, 
race, ethnicity, number of prior regimens for advanced STS, region, histology, baseline ECOG 
performance status , prior anti-cancer therapy type and AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) 
Sarcoma tumor stage at the date of histological diagnosis. If it was applicable, the stratified factors would 
be histology, geographic region, and number of prior regimens for advanced STS. 
PFS was compared between the treatment arms using two-sided stratified log-rank test, stratified by 
histology, geographic region and number of prior regimens for advanced STS on both Full Analysis Set 
and Per-Protocol Analysis set.

Recruitment 
Study 309 was conducted between 10 Mar 2011 and 02 Jan 2015 at 110 study sites in three geographical 
regions: the United States and Canada (Region 1); Western Europe, Australia, and Israel (Region 2); and 
Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia (Region 3). 
Conduct of the study 
An interim analysis on efficacy data was conducted when 247 deaths (70% of the events) were observed, 
and was performed by an independent statistical reporting team. The data cut-off date for the interim 
analysis was 20 Oct 2013 (the date of the 247th event). The DMC reviewed the interim efficacy and safety 
data on 18 Feb 2014 and recommended that the study continue without modification. 
Dry runs were conducted on hypothetical data to test the statistical programs on the datasets to ensure 
Assessment report

they would work properly for the final analysis. However, unintentionally interim results from study 309 
were used for these dry runs. Once the final analysis was conducted, it became obvious that the final KM 
curves and those from the dry runs were almost identical. 
The Applicant conducted an internal investigation and concluded that there was no evidence that the 
exposure of the interim results had any impact on the final results. The first dry run was conducted on 
June 19, 2014, one year after the last patient was enrolled (May 28, 2013). The last dry run was 
conducted in November 2014. At the time of the first dry run, 82% of survival endpoints had been 
accrued. The MAH did not make any major amendments to the protocol after the dry runs.  
Amendments and Protocol Deviations 
There were two amendments to the protocol. Amendment 01 was issued on 25 May 2012 and pertained 
mainly to revisions of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Amendment 02 was issued on 08 Aug 2012 and 
pertained to study drug permanently discontinued in the event of Grade 3 or 4 QTc interval prolongation. 
An initial review of all protocol deviations identified 22 subjects who had a major protocol violation based 
on the following protocol specified criteria:  
- Deviation from inclusion criteria 1 – 3 
- Treated with the incorrect study drug versus the randomized treatment. 
Following review of the analysis, an additional 16 subjects were identified as having a major protocol 
violation on the basis of inclusion/exclusion criteria, study drug dosing error, or other criteria that could 
potentially affect the safety or efficacy analyses. Therefore, a total of 38 subjects (8.4%) were excluded 
from the Per Protocol Analysis Set and a larger percentage of subjects in the dacarbazine arm (11.2%) 
had a major protocol violation than subjects in the eribulin arm (5.7%).

Subgroup Analysis of OS 
Planned subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint of OS were conducted for subjects in the FAS 
population based on age group, sex, race, ethnicity, number of prior regimens, geographic region, 
tumour histology, baseline ECOG PS, prior anticancer therapy type and AJCC sarcoma tumour grade at 
the date of histology diagnosis.

As the subgroup analyses for OS and PFS indicated a differential benefit between the ADI and LMS (ADI 
[OS HR 0.51; PFS HR 0.52] vs. LMS [OS HR 0.93; PFS HR 1. 07]), separate baseline and outcome data 
for the two subtypes including subgroup analyses were requested:

From these analyses it is apparent that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by 
the patients with the ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a median OS of 
about 16 months for the eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the dacarbazine arm. In

Two PROs were included for the analysis of QoL (exploratory analyses). These were the EORTC 
questionnaire QLQC30 and the EQ-5D-3L (administered at baseline, pre-dose on Day 1 of each treatment 
cycle and at the Off-treatment Visit).  
Compliance 
Overall study compliance was good for both measures throughout the course of the study and did not fall 
below 70%. 
No absolute differences in PRO compliance were observed between treatment arms.

Sarcoma 
A multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study conducted in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Poland and 
France. A total of 128 subjects were enrolled between13 Dec 2006 to 28 Jun 2012. 
The study was an EORTC conducted study. 
The study enrolled subjects who had histologically confirmed and measurable (RECIST) advanced and/ or 
metastatic STS of the following histology: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), adipocytic (ADI), synovial sarcoma 
(SYN), or other types of sarcoma (OTH) and with evidence of objective progression within the last 6 
months (RECIST). No more than one prior combination regimen or two single agent cytotoxic drugs for 
metastatic disease were allowed (prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy included). 
The subjects were treated with eribulin mesilate 1.4 mg/m² on Days 1 and 8, every 21 days.  
A total of 115 patients were evaluable for efficacy and were divided into four strata: leiomyosarcoma 
(LMS, n=38), adipocytic (ADI, n=32), synovial sarcoma (SYN, n=19) or other types of sarcoma (OTH, 
n=26). The limited number of patients in each group is recognised. 
Primary endpoint was PFS12 weeks and secondary endpoints were Overall PFS, ORR, CRB rate, time to onset 
of response, duration of response and OS. 
The primary endpoint showed response in 47% of the patients in the ADI stratum, 32% in the LMS 
stratum, 21% in the SYN stratum and 19% in the OTH stratum. 
The median PFS time was similar for each of the four strata (82, 88, 81 and 72 days for the ADI, LMS, 
SYN and OTH strata respectively). 
Only one patient (in the ADI stratum) experienced a CR at Week 12. One patient in each of the ADI, SYN, 
and OTH strata experienced a PR. No difference among the strata for the ORR was observed (3%, 5%, 
5%, and 4% for the ADI, LMS, SYN and OTH strata respectively). 
 Study E7389-J081-217 (study 217): An Open-label, Multi-centre, Phase 2 Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy and Safety of Eribulin in Previously Treated Subjects with Advanced or Metastatic 
Soft Tissue Sarcoma 
Study 217 was initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of eribulin in the treatment of subjects with 
advanced or metastatic STS in Japan. 
The study was conducted between 14 November 2011 and 14 November 2014 (date of database cut-off) 
at 13 study sites in Japan.  A total of 51 patients were evaluable for efficacy in this study (35 patients in 
the ADI (n=16)/LMS (n=19) stratum and 16 patients in the OTH stratum. The inclusion/ exclusion criteria 
and eribulin dose regimen are in line with that of the pivotal study 309. 
Primary endpoint was PFR12wks and secondary endpoints were PFS, OS, ORR, DCR, CBR and dSDR. 
The primary endpoint showed progression-free survival at Week 12 in 60 % of the patients (95% CI: 
42.1, 76.1) in the ADI/ LMS stratum and 31 % (95% CI: 11.0, 58.7) in the OTH stratum. 
The median PFS time was 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.79, 8.18) in the ADI/LMS stratum and 2 months (95% 
CI: 1.22, 4.07) in the OTH stratum. 
The median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 11.01, 20.47) in the ADI/LMS stratum and about 8 months 
(95% CI: 3.84, 16.13) in the OTH stratum.  
There were no complete or partial responses observed. DCR was 80 % and 50 %, CBR was 74 % and 50 
% and dSDR was 74 % and 50 % for ADI/ LMS and OTH strata respectively.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is applying for an extension of the indication for eribulin in the treatment of patients with locally 
advanced and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application formally rests on the pivotal 309 study, a randomized, open-label, multi-centre, Phase III 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of eribulin to that of dacarbazine in patients previously treated 
for locally advanced and/or metastatic tumours of either the adipocytic subtype (liposarcoma [ADI]) or of 
smooth muscle origin (leiomyosarcoma [LMS]). 
The inclusion- and exclusion criteria are considered adequately reflecting the target population for the 
proposed indication in terms of ADI and LMS subtypes. However, although STS may also occur in the 
paediatric population, it is noted that only patients aged ≥ 18 years were eligible for inclusion in the 
pivotal study. The safety and efficacy of Halaven in children from birth to 18 years of age have not yet 
been established in soft tissue sarcoma and the indication in the SmPC now refers to “adults”. 
In Q2 2015 the MAH informed the regulatory authorities of so-called “dry runs” where interim results 
from study 309 were used for these dry runs. This became clear once the final analysis was conducted, as 
the final KM curves and those from the dry runs were almost identical. The primary endpoint of the study 
is OS and it is considered robust and not easily manipulated.  Thus, even though interim results were 
unintentionally exposed there is no evidence of any bias of the primary analysis of study 309.  
The protocol was amended twice and it is considered unlikely that the amendments and protocol 
violations have a relevant impact on the integrity of the study. 
The study enrolled 452 patients randomised in a 1:1 design (n=228 in the eribulin arm; n=224 in the 
dacarbazine arm) and stratified by histology (ADI or LMS), region (Region 1: USA and Canada; or Region 
2: Western Europe, Australia and Israel; or Region 3: Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia), and 
number of prior regimens for advanced STS (2 or >2 prior regimens). 
Median time from diagnosis is about 3 years which is a common feature observed in the target 
population. The vast majority had non-lymph nodes as target lesions which is not unexpected since STS 
most commonly metastasize to the lungs and to a lesser extent to the lymph nodes. 
Some imbalances in terms of baseline disease characteristics (“time between the original histological 
diagnosis and randomisation” and “non-target lesions at baseline”) were noted. This has been adequately 
clarified during the procedure and there is no reason to assume that these imbalances could have an 
effect on OS and PFS. 
The eribulin dose regimen (1.4 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle) was established in the 
E7389-G000-305 study (EMBRACE) performed in metastatic breast cancer and is considered justified. It 
is to be noted that the dose of 1.4 mg/m2 refers to the salt form (eribulin mesilate) which is equivalent to 
1.23 mg/m2 of the base of the active substance (eribulin).  This has been adequately highlighted in the 
Halaven SmPC section 4.2. 
Dacarbazine as the comparator is considered acceptable. In 2010 the MAH applied for a scientific advice 
on the clinical development plan for eribulin in STS and the design of the future Phase III study 309 
including the use of dacarbazine as the comparator. Either1200 mg/m2, 1000 mg/m2, or 850 mg/m2 as 
starting dose could be chosen at the discretion of the investigator. The selection of the starting dose for 
each patient had to be confirmed prior to randomization.  
Although a blinded study would have been preferred, feasibility issues, such as differences in tolerability 
between treatment arms could be foreseen and therefore the open-label design is acceptable.

Demographic and baseline characteristics are reasonably well balanced between the treatment arms. It is 
recognised that the study enrolled heavily pre-treated patients. It is noted that while STS in general show 
a slight predominance in the male gender, in this study the majority were female patients (67 %). This is 
likely due to a higher than expected proportion of patients with uterine LMS enrolled (about 30 % of the 
LMS stratum). 
Median age at study entry was 56 years which reflects the clinical target population. About 21% of 
subjects were aged ≥65 years. Close to 50 % were recruited from Region 2 (Western Europe, Australia 
and Israel). 
Approximately 1/3 of the overall population were patients with ADI and 2/3 were LMS with similar 
distribution between the two arms.  
AEs as reasons for treatment discontinuations were low with approx. 6 % in the erbulin arm and 4.5 % in 
the DTIC arm. Withdrawal of consent was likewise low with about 1 % and 2 % respectively. About 10 % 
discontinued due to clinical progression which was similar in both arms.  
In conclusion, there are no major concerns identified with respect to the conduct of the pivotal study. The 
population studied is considered representative for the target population in terms of ADI and LMS. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study was OS. The study met its primary objective with an estimated 
reduction of death of 23 % in the experimental arm (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.618, 0.954]; p=0.0169) with an 
improved benefit favouring eribulin of a median of 2 months (13.5 months and 11.5 months 
respectively). The magnitude of the statistical significance with a p-value of about 0.017 is not considered 
overwhelming but is still within the boundaries of statistical significance.  
No differences between the two arms were observed with respect to the secondary endpoints (PFS, 
PFR12wks and CBR). In terms of PFS no difference in medians between the arms was observed with 2.6 
months (HR=0.877 [95% CI 0.710, 1.085]; P=0.2287) however the HR of 0.88 may be indicative of an 
improved treatment effect for eribulin as compared to dacarbazine. 
The PFR12wks was 33 % (95% CI 27.2, 39.9) in the eribulin arm and about 29 % (95% CI 22.8, 35.0) in 
the control arm (p = 0.253).  The CBR was 46 % (95% CI 39.5, 52.8) in the eribulin arm and 48 % (95% 
CI 41.1, 54.5) in the dacarbazine arm (p=0.741). 
ORR was performed as an exploratory analysis. No significant differences between the two arms for either 
ORR, DCR or dSD rate could be observed.  
There is no overall consistency in regard to HR in the subgroups analyses for either OS or PFS. In 
particular, the apparent discrepancy with respect to histology stands out indicating a differential benefit.  
In addition to the pre-planned efficacy analysis of OS and PFS by histological subtypes, the MAH has 
provided as requested, post hoc analyses in terms of baseline and outcome data separately for the two 
histology subtypes including data on the subtypes of ADI enrolled in the study i.e. dedifferentiated, 
myxoid/round cell and pleomorphic liposarcoma. The OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine appears 
entirely driven by the patients with the ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a 
median OS of about 16 months for the eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the 
dacarbazine arm. In addition, a benefit in PFS can be observed with a median PFS of 2.9 months vs. 1.7 
months in the eribulin and dacarbazine arm, respectively, with a HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.346; 0.784, 
P=0.0015).  
As emphasised by the MAH, the different subtypes of ADI (dedifferentiated, myxoid/round cell, 
pleomorphic) may be viewed as biologically different, but the small sample size and absence of preformed 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 52/92 
 
  
  
hypotheses make further analyses less than meaningful. Thus it is accepted that activity has been shown 
irrespective of the different subtypes of ADI.  On the other hand, a benefit is not shown in the LMS 
population as no difference at all between the two treatment arms is observed. The HR is 0.93 (95% CI 
0.714, 1.203; P=0.57) for OS with a median of about 13 months in both arms. For PFS the HR is 1.07 
(95% CI 0.835, 1.375; P=0.585) with a similar median of about 2.5 months.  
The MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS. If this 
actually were the case, i.e. that similarity in PFS (HR 1.07) reflected a meaningful delay in progression for 
both study arms vs. a virtual placebo, then it would be expected that post progression survival would be 
prolonged in the eribulin arm, analogues to findings in breast cancer and ADI. This is not the case, 
however. Therefore the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is 
meaningfully active in LMS.  
The apparent difference, especially in PFS between uterine and non-uterine sarcoma is noticed. This is an 
unexpected finding from a tumour biology perspective as currently described and from the perspective of 
“non-activity” of dacarbazine and eribulin is rather interpreted as reflecting differences in baseline 
prognostic factors.  
There seemed to be an interaction between ECOG PS 0 and 1 with patients with performance status >0 
having little effect of eribulin. The requested exploratory analysis shows that the interaction seems to be 
driven by patients with LMS and ECOG 1. Although it is recognised that patients were not stratified by 
ECOG score, nevertheless this analysis seems to add more evidence to the fact that the effect of eribulin 
in the LMS population is limited.  
The overall number of events in the study at the time of the analysis (data cut-off date 02 January 2015) 
was about 79 % for OS and 85 % for PFS. A satisfactory level of data maturity is considered reached. 
It is concluded that in isolation the two exploratory studies (207 and 217) cannot be claimed as 
supportive. To this effect, contextualisation of the primary endpoint PFR12weeks was warranted. PFR12wks 
for ADI and LMS was compared with corresponding data in study 309. For eribulin it is agreed that there 
is consistency shown for the respective histology subgroups between study 309 and study 207 with 41 % 
and 47 % for ADI vs. 30 % and 32 % for LMS in the respective studies. An overall higher PFS12weeks was 
observed in the 217 study but with similar discrepancy pattern between the two histology subgroups as 
observed in the 309 and 207 studies.  
For dacarbazine PFR12wks for ADI and LMS in study 309 was to be compared with corresponding data from 
other dacarbazine studies, e.g. using the EORTC data base.  The study by García-del-Muro, et al. (2011) 
compared gemcitabine plus dacarbazine with dacarbazine alone in 113 patients with previously treated 
STS (mixed). The PFR at 3 months was 56% (95% CI: 43% to 69%) for gemcitabine plus dacarbazine 
versus 37% (95% CI: 23.5% to 50%) for dacarbazine alone (P=0.001). The study by Demetri G, et al., 
(2015) compared trabectedin with dacarbazine in 518 patients with metastatic ADI or LMS. The PFR at 3 
months was 34% for patients on the dacarbazine arm. 
It is noted that the PFS12weeks for dacarbazine in the two publications is similar to the results obtained for 
eribulin in LMS in the 309 study. In terms of PFS12weeks, the findings are consistent with the primary 
analysis i.e. no superior efficacy obtained for eribulin in regard to LMS as compared to dacarbazine. 
The initially proposed indication encompassed STS not subtype specified. As no benefit has been 
demonstrated in LMS the indication has been revised to only include adult patients with unresectable 
liposarcoma. Moreover, “prior systemic therapy” has been revised to reflect that standard chemotherapy 
is based on anthracyclines as the 1st line treatment.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has been shown exclusively in the ADI population and as such the 
indication has been restricted to the adult patient population with unresectable liposarcoma. The 
magnitude of the benefit is of definite high clinical relevance in this STS subtype and would meet an 
unmet medical need. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Existing safety profile 
The current knowledge of the safety profile is based primarily on studies in breast cancer. In this setting, 
the major undesirable effects related to Halaven include, as per SmPC, bone marrow suppression 
including neutropenia (57%; grade 3/4: 50%) with associated infections (e.g. sepsis 0.5%); anaemia 
(21%) and thrombocytopenia (5%). New onset or worsening of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (36%; 
grade 3/4: 8%). Gastrointestinal toxicities are common, including nausea (34%), vomiting (18%), 
diarrhoea (18%), constipation (20%), and stomatitis. Other significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
include fatigue (48%; grade 3/4: 8%), alopecia, increased liver enzymes, pyrexia (20%), bone pain 
(10%) and musculoskeletal pain. 
Safety analysis populations 
The data to support the safety of eribulin in the soft tissue sarcoma (STS) indication are based on data 
from 404 subjects in 1 pivotal phase III trial and 2 phase II trials, supported by data from 1559 subjects 
in one of eight completed trials in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) as follows:

Population 
a: Subjects who received 28-day cycles of eribulin in Study 201 have been excluded from the analysis. 
b: The six subjects who continued to receive eribulin in extension Study 224 after receiving eribulin in Study 221 are included in the 
total of 81 treated subjects for Study 221. Data from Study 221 were pooled with the data from Study 224, once all enrolled subjects 
had discontinued treatment in Study 224. 
The safety data in this review are based on a data cut-off date for Study 309 of 02 January 2015, a data 
cut-off date for Study 217 of 14 November 2014 and a data cut-off date for Study 207 of 12 June 2012.  
All MBC trials except Study 206 have been previously submitted and assessed.  
In all studies submitted as part of this variation application, the labelled standard dose of eribulin was 
used, i.e. 1.4 mg/m2 (equivalent to 1.23 mg/m2 in the EU SmPC) on Day 1 and 8 in a 21-day cycle.

Adverse events 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Table 31: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
A subject with two or more TEAEs in the category of one row is counted once in that row. 
Study 207 did not assess action taken with respect to the study drug through the adverse event CRF data, and is therefore not 
reflected in the rows for "study drug action taken" and "study drug withdrawn" for its incidence of this nature.  
Adverse event terms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1. 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, MedDRA = Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
a The STS includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309. 
b The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 
206, 209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305.

neutropenia are reported as a single terms. 
Source: SCS, Table 8. 
STS vs. MBC 
Compared with the MBC population some differences in the overall patter of treatment-emergent adverse 
events TEAEs are noted. Severe TEAEs (≥CTCAE toxicity grade 3) were a few percent lower, while non-
fatal SAEs were around 10% higher in the STS population, as well as in the pivotal study, compared with 
the MBC population. (Fatal SAEs were similar around 4%.) TEAEs leading to dose reduction, interruption 
or withdrawal were considerable higher in the pivotal phase III trial (47%), but only slightly higher in the 
full STS population (31%) compared with the MBC (27%). Withdrawals due to TEAEs were numerically 
lower, however; thus, the differences in the former figures reflect differences in dose adjustments.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 57/92 
 
  
  
 
With regard to TEAEs of special interest, most showed lower frequencies in the pivotal study (and full STS 
population) compared with the MBC population (potentially related to observation time, as noted above). 
Asthenia/fatigue was considerably more frequent in the STS studies however (61-63% vs. 51% in MBC).  
Eribulin vs. dacarbazine 
In Study 309, the proportion of patients with TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were similar across arms (numerically around 2% higher in the eribulin arm for each item). 
Severe TEAEs were more frequent in the eribulin arm (67 vs. 56%). Fatal SAEs were more frequent in the 
eribulin arm (4.4 vs. 1.3%; n= 10 vs. 3). Dose adjustments and withdrawals due to TEAEs were more 
frequent in the eribulin arm. It is noted that the frequencies of dose adjustments and withdrawals due to 
TEAEs were higher in both study arms compared with the eribulin-treated MBC population.  
For TEAEs of special interest, see further below. No new safety concern is raised.

The well-known major side effects of eribulin were seen as anticipated, e.g. neutropenia and related 
infections, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue and asthenia, nausea and vomiting, musculo-/skeletal pain, 
pyrexia, and alopecia.  
It is noted that for some AEs related to tolerability, the frequencies were similar across study arms. These 
include fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia and diarrhoea. With regard to nausea and 
vomiting the dacarbazine arm had higher frequencies. Other ADRs that are likely to affect the B/R 
balance and that occurred in higher frequency in the eribulin arm include peripheral neuropathy, 
neutropenia, infections and stomatitis. Alopecia may also be of some importance. 
STS vs. MBC 
Some TEAEs in the eribulin arm of Study 309 were less frequent compared with the MBC population, 
which may reflect the shorter observation time in the STS setting, differences in the underlying disease, 
or other differences in the study settings, including investigator’s perception of the drug and the disease.  
Some TEAEs were relevantly more frequent in the STS pivotal study compared with the MBC population. 
These include pyrexia, stomatitis, fatigue and asthenia, and anaemia. For all except anaemia, the 
frequencies were similar (or higher) in the full STS population including the Phase II studies, indicating 
that there may be a relevant difference in the safety profile in the STS indication for these AEs.  
Treatment-related TEAEs 
The direction of observed differences and the similarities for TEAEs across arms in study 309 noted above 
were consistent for the treatment-related TEAEs, although these were reported at lower absolute 
frequencies.

If a subject had two or more treatment-emergent adverse events in the same system organ class (or with the same preferred 
term) with different CTCAE grades, then the event with the highest grade was used for that subject. System organ classes are 
presented in descending frequency. 
Adverse event terms are coded using MedDRA version 17.1. 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, MBC = metastatic breast cancer, MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities, STS = soft tissue sarcoma, TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. 
The STS Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin in sarcoma studies 207, 217, and 309 
The MBC Population includes all subjects treated with eribulin monotherapy in 21-day cycles in breast cancer studies 201, 206, 
209, 211, 221, 224, 301, and 305. 
The Eribulin Integrated Safety Population includes all subjects in the STS and MBC  
*: selected by assessor based on interest for the assessment. 
The proportion of subjects with any toxicity grade 3 or higher was approximately 10% higher in the 
eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309. This corresponds to the approximately 
10% higher frequency of haematological grade 3 events in the eribulin arm. Infections grade ≥ 3 are 
approximately twice as common in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm (10 vs. 5%). 
Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy (including sensory, motor, and paraesthesia) was more frequent in the 
eribulin arm (3.1%) compared with the dacarbazine arm (0.4%). 
Grade ≥ 3 fatigue/asthenia was similar across arms (approximately 5%), just as the overall frequency 
was similar. For pyrexia a large difference in overall frequency across study arms was observed (28 vs 
14%), but similar grade ≥ 3 frequencies (<1%).  
For the respiratory conditions SOC, grade ≥ 3 events would be of similar frequencies if pulmonary 
embolism was referred to the Vascular disorders SOC (where deep vein thrombosis is the major event), 
which would then in turn also have similar grade ≥ 3 frequencies. Thus, no real difference of importance 
across arms appears to be present.  
Grade ≥ 3 musculoskeletal pain, including back and bone pain, was reported somewhat more frequently 
in the dacarbazine arm. 
In conclusion, with regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen 
in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and 
peripheral neuropathy. Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine 
arm. In other parts grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.

Non-fatal SAEs 
Table 34: Incidence of Most Common (≥1% in any population) Non-Fatal SAEs by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term 
The overall incidence of non-fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar across arms in Study 309, 
32.7 vs. 31.3%. Similar frequencies were also seen for SAEs considered by investigators to be treatment 
related, 13.7 vs. 13.8%. 
SAE differences of relevance across arms were confined to the Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
SOC, and to the TEAE pyrexia.  
Neutropenia was the most common SAE in the eribulin arm at 4.9%, compared with 4.5% (1 patient less) 
in the dacarbazine arm; i.e. the frequency was similar. Other SAEs in this SOC were more common in the 
dacarbazine-treated patients. Thus, thrombocytopenia was the most common SAE in the dacarbazine arm 
at 5.8%, compared with 0% in the eribulin arm. Similarly, pancytopenia was a SAE in 3 patients (1.3%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017

in the dacarbazine arm vs. none in the eribulin arm. Overall, dacarbazine had more SAEs in the Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders SOC than eribulin (11.6 vs. 7.5%).  
Pyrexia was more common as an SAE in the eribulin compared with the dacarbazine arm, 4.4 vs. 1.8%.  
Pulmonary embolism + deep vein thrombosis constituted SAEs in 6 patients (2.7%) in both arms. 
Deaths 
Table 35: Listing of TEAEs Leading to Death (Sarcoma Population: Study 309, Study 217 and Study 207) 
Most of the fatal TEAEs listed above were deemed by the MAH to be due to disease progression. 
In 2 cases, the Investigator and MAH opinion differed regarding relatedness to study drug: a fatal TEAE of 
septic shock in Study 309 was considered to be unrelated to eribulin by the Investigator, although the 
MAH considers the event was possibly related to eribulin; and for the fatal TEAE of cerebrovascular 
ischemia in Study 207, the Investigator considered the event to be possibly related to eribulin, but the 
MAH considers the event more likely to be related to the subject’s past medical history. This included 
arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary bypass, 
congestive heart failure, and a history of treatment with oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, 
hypolipidemic agents, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and other supportive medication.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 64/92 
 
  
  
 
 
Of the reviewed deaths in the STS population, 2 cases of fatal neutropenic sepsis and septic shock, 
respectively, were considered related to the eribulin treatment. In the dacarbazine arm all three deaths  
were due to progressive disease. 
Adverse events of special interest 
The MAH has selected the following “adverse events of special interest” (AESI):  
Peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia, arthralgia/myalgia, asthenia/fatigue, and 
alopecia. Most are addressed in prior sections of this assessment report. For neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia, please see under Laboratory findings below. 
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) 
Table 36: Summary of Peripheral Neuropathy (PN) Events 
In the 1559 breast cancer patients the most common adverse reaction resulting in discontinuation of 
treatment with eribulin was peripheral neuropathy (3.4%).  The median time to Grade 2 peripheral 
neuropathy was 12.6 weeks (post 4 cycles). Out of the 404 sarcoma patients, 2 patients discontinued 
treatment with eribulin due to peripheral neuropathy. The median time to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy 
was 18.4 weeks.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 65/92 
 
  
  
 
Development of Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 7.4% of breast cancer patients and 3.5% 
of sarcoma patients. In clinical trials, patients with pre-existing neuropathy were as likely to develop new 
or worsening symptoms as those who entered the study without the condition. 
In breast cancer patients with pre-existing Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy the frequency of 
treatment-emergent Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 14%. 
No fatal events (Grade 5 severity) were reported in any population and there were no events of Grade 4 
severity in the STS population. 
The frequency of PN events was similar in the STS and MBC populations (approximately 40%).  
Of the 166 patients (41%) of the STS population (n=404) who experienced a PN event, 116 (28% of all 
patients, 70% of those with PN) had PN ongoing at last treatment. For 26 patients (22% of those with 
PN) PN resolved within 60 days post treatment; for 47(41% of those with PN) PN was unresolved at 60 
days post treatment, and for the remainder, 37 patients (37% of those with PN), resolution was unknown 
due to start of new therapy.  
At an updated analysis in the STS population 180 days after the last treatment 28% (32/166) of eribulin 
PN events had resolved compared with 22% (26/166) at 60 days after last treatment, indicating further 
resolution.

Pyrexia 
A large difference in overall frequency of pyrexia across arms in Study 309 was observed (28 vs 14%), 
but the grade ≥ 3 frequencies were similar (<1%). The incidence was highest (14-12%) in the first two 
cycles, following which the incidence decreased substantially. Median duration of pyrexia was 2 days and 
events were of low grade in most cases (only 1% were grade ≥3).

Low neutrophils and leukocytes were less frequently observed in the STS compared with the MBC setting, 
likely at least partly related to the shorter duration of treatment, based on the similar rates of 
neutropenia in time-adjusted analyses. The use of immunostimulants (such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) 
was similar in the arms of Study 309 and the STS population: 26.1% of subjects in the eribulin arm of 
Study 309, 25.4% in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 and 23.8% in the STS population.

Table 41: Treatment-Emergent Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Test Values - Clinical Chemistry 
In Study 309, markedly-abnormally low calcium, phosphorous, and potassium occurred more frequently 
in the eribulin group (2.3%, 3.6%, and 8.0%, respectively), compared with the dacarbazine group (0.4%, 
1.8%, and 2.7%, respectively). Markedly-abnormally high glucose, AST and bilirubin was also more 
common the in eribulin group (3.8%, 1.8 and 1.8%, respectively) compared with the dacarbazine group 
(1.0%, 0.9 and 0.5%, respectively).  
Markedly-abnormally low phosphorous was also reported more commonly in the STS population (8.2%), 
compared with the MBC population (4.2%). Markedly-abnormally low calcium, was reported less 
commonly in the STS population (0.5%), compared with the MBC population (1.6%). Other clinically 
relevant abnormal laboratory test values occurred at a similar frequency in both the STS and MBC 
populations.

Hy’s law 
The integrated laboratory data were assessed for evidence of drug-induced liver injury. A total of 41 
subjects had total bilirubin concentrations that were ≥1.5 x ULN with either concurrent AST and/or ALT ≥ 
3 x ULN at least once during the study. The data showed that there were 9 subjects in the STS studies 
whose laboratory values met these limits. One of these subjects was in the dacarbazine arm of Study 
309, and the remaining 8 subjects were treated with eribulin (4 subjects in Study 309, 3 subjects in 
Study 207 and 1 subject in Study 217). Metastatic disease was present in the liver for 7 of these 9 
subjects, and 1 subject had hepatic necrosis (ischemic necrosis of the liver) at baseline; none of these 
subjects had increased total bilirubin concentrations or liver enzyme activities that were not reasonably 
explainable by their baseline liver conditions. No subjects in the STS population met the criteria for Hy’s 
law (including criteria concerning cholestasis and alternative aetiologies).  
The proportion of subjects in the STS population with elevated bilirubin (≥1.5 x ULN) concurrently with 
elevated AST and/or ALT (≥3 x ULN) was 8/404 subjects (2.0%); similar to that seen for the MBC 
population (36/1559 subjects [2.3%]). 
Vital signs 
There was no apparent pattern of changes with time on treatment for vital sign parameters (e.g. blood 
pressure, temperature, respiratory rate). Results were consistent with the known safety profile of eribulin 
and did not signal any new significant safety concerns. 
QTc prolongation 
In Study 309, there were no changes of clinical importance in mean ECG parameters over time. 
The incidence of QT prolongation TEAEs was calculated using the following Sponsor-derived query for QT 
prolongation: “Broad and narrow SMQ terms for Torsade de pointes with the exception that ‘Long QT 
syndrome congenital’ was deleted. Also, broad and narrow SMQ terms for tachyarrhythmias (including 
supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmia).” 
Table 42: Summary of TEAEs within the SDQ term for QT prolongation 
The 5 treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 severity in the STS population were all events of 
electrocardiogram QT prolonged which occurred in Study 309; all 5 events were of Grade 3 severity. The 
3 treatment-related TEAEs of Grade ≥3 severity in the MBC population were: 1 event of sudden death 
(Grade 5), 1 event of electrocardiogram QT prolonged (Grade 3), and 1 event of syncope (Grade 3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017

An analysis using a narrower SDQ term for QT prolongation was provided in response to questions. This 
included the TEAEs coding to the SDQ Torsades de pointes/QT prolongation SMQ narrow with the deletion 
of “Long QT syndrome congenital”. The only PT reported coding to this SDQ in the eribulin studies was 
“Electrocardiogram QT prolonged”. 
Table 43: Summary of TEAEs within the narrow SMQ for QT prolongation/TdP 
There appears to be no major difference in the frequency of QT prolongation events for eribulin vs 
dacarbazine-treated patients in Study 309. The QT-prolongating ability of dacarbazine is unknown. The 
QT-prolongating ability of eribulin also remains unknown.

Age  
In the 404 sarcoma patient population, 90 patients (22.3%) treated with eribulin were ≥65 years of age. 
Population PK analyses showed that there was no significant effect of age on eribulin PK. Eribulin 
exposure in elderly subjects was similar to that in younger subjects.

Race 
Table 45: Summary of Neutropenia Events in White and Asian/Pacific Islander Subjects 
An increased incidence of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased in Asian/Pacific Islander subjects is a 
known effect of eribulin; the increased incidence was also seen in the MBC population as well as in the 
STS population. This difference seems not to be a drug specific phenomenon, as several other 
publications (Gandara, et al., 2009; Hasegawa, et al., 2011) have discussed similar situations where the 
incidence of neutropenia in Asian subjects has been shown to be twice as high as in non-Asian subjects. 
Other than TEAEs of neutropenia, and laboratory abnormalities of neutrophil count decreased, there did 
not appear to be a consistent pattern of overall TEAE incidence with racial group, among eribulin-treated 
subjects in the STS and MBC populations. These results confirm the data seen in the breast cancer 
population, which indicate that, with the exception of neutropenia, race does not affect the way eribulin is 
tolerated.

Sex 
Table 46: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Sex (STS Population) 
Analyses by sex are confounded by indications (ADI/LMS) with different treatment effect and time on 
therapy. Thus, the eribulin-treated leiomyosarcoma subgroup of Study 309 consisted of 82% women, 
while the adipocytic subgroup was more balanced with 46% women. In addition, differences in baseline 
characteristics indicated slightly poorer prognosis in women compared with men (higher tumour grade, 
higher ECOG performance status, larger number of prior chemotherapy regimens). Together, these 
circumstances may provide explanations for the higher frequency of fatal AEs seen in women compared 
with men, which were mostly related to disease progression. The frequencies of treatment-related deaths 
(0.8 vs. 0.7%) were not unbalanced across sexes, however. The higher frequency of the cumulative 
toxicity peripheral neuropathy observed in men compared with women may be due to the imbalances in 
the histologic subgroups noted above. No important differences in safety profile across sexes are seen.

Histology 
Table 47: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events for System Organ Classes which have at least one Preferred 
Term with Frequency >= 5% within the SOC (Eribulin STS ISS Population) Safety Population 
The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic/anatomic subgroups; observed 
differences may be the result of differences in exposure and/or underlying disease.  
Peripheral neuropathy and related PTs were more frequent in adipocytic compared with leiomyosarcoma, 
particularly with regard to events ≥ grade 3, which was approximately 6 vs. 2 % in both Study 309 and 
the full STS population. PFS data indicate that the time on eribulin was longer in the adipocytic compared 
with the leiomyosarcoma subgroup.  
Renal insufficiency 
The eribulin sarcoma studies excluded subjects with severe renal impairment (e.g. included patients with 
serum creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/minutes per the Cockcroft and 
Gault formula). 
A study in renal impairment has been previously submitted and assessed within the Variation II/23 and 
findings were reflected in the SmPC. A large variability was found between patients and across renal 
impairment groups, why a recommendation regarding starting dose could not be made; instead increased 
monitoring is recommended for all patients with renal impairment.

Hepatic insufficiency 
Table 48: Neutropenia TEAEs and Laboratory Abnormalities by Liver Function 
Neutropenia in relation to liver function 
The overall cumulative incidence of neutropenia events, including laboratory abnormalities observed in 
the registration of laboratory parameters, was lower in the STS compared with the MBC, as previously 
noted, at least partially attributable to differences in treatment duration. Similar trends were seen in both 
disease settings for a small increase in neutropenia events in patients with grade 1 liver toxicity 
compared with patients with normal liver function. In the MBC population information from patients with 
grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity was also available, indicting a further small increase in the frequency of 
neutropenia events. Lower frequencies of neutropenia were seen in pivotal Study 309, with a similar 
trend in relation to liver toxicity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 74/92 
 
  
  
 
Peripheral neuropathy in relation to liver function 
The corresponding analysis was performed for peripheral neuropathy, where no trend of increased toxicity 
was seen for patients with grade 1 liver toxicity in study 309 or in the STS (n=40 and 72, respectively). 
In the MBC, as well as in the eribulin integrated safety population (STS+MBC), a clear trend of increased 
frequencies of peripheral neuropathy at grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity was seen, however. The approximate 
frequencies of peripheral neuropathy in both these populations were 40% for normal liver function, 41-
42% for grade 1 liver toxicity, and 51% for grade ≥ 2 liver toxicity. 
Similar trends of increased toxicity overall depending on baseline bilirubin, ALT, or AST statuses, 
respectively, and for peripheral neuropathy depending on a combined liver function status, have been 
observed in previous Halaven submissions based on the MBC population (e.g. Variation II/11 for new 
indication, SCS Tables 34, 58-60) and discussed in ARs.  
It has previously been established that hepatic impairment increases the exposure to eribulin, therefore 
these findings are expected. The increase in toxicity is overall rather limited. No new safety issue is 
raised.  
Extrinsic factors 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No AEs of drug interaction were reported in Study 309, Study 207 or Study 217. 
Sarcoma population (STS) adverse drug reactions 
The table below is based on all adverse reactions observed for all 3 sarcoma studies and shows TEAEs by 
incidence rate (regardless of investigator assessment of relationship to eribulin treatment) and has been 
compiled according to the recommendations of CIOMS III – Core Clinical Safety Information.  Detailed 
analysis of the source tables, including analyses of individual TEAEs and review of individual TEAE reports 
where necessary, have been performed in compiling the table.  Events are included if the company 
believes there to be sufficient evidence of a relationship with eribulin mesilate; the table is thus a 
summary compiled using the frequencies of individual events and medical judgment in assessing the 
evidence for those less common individual events to be included.

across arms, but with emphasis on neutropenia in the eribulin arm and thrombocytopenia in the 
dacarbazine arm, in line with the safety profiles.  
Peripheral neuropathy and pyrexia caused drug action to be taken in the eribulin arm (at 4.4 and 3.5%) 
but only in single patients in the dacarbazine arm, also in line with the known toxicity profiles.  
While similar overall and grade ≥ 3 frequencies were observed for fatigue/asthenia across arms, these 
conditions lead to dose reduction/interruption/(withdrawal, see below) more often in the eribulin 
compared with the dacarbazine arm (4.4 vs 1.8%, n: 10 vs. 4). 
ALT elevation, AST elevation, and hyperglycemia were each causes for dose reduction or interruption in 
three eribulin-treated patients (1.3%), but not for drug withdrawal apparently. No drug action was taken 
based on these events in the dacarbazine arm. 
When only TEAEs leading to drug withdrawal were summarised it was noted that for neuropathy this was 
done in 2 vs. 1 patient in the eribulin vs. dacarbazine arm; fatigue lead to drug withdrawal in 2 vs 2 
cases, asthenia 0 vs. 0, neutropenia 0 vs. 0, thrombocytopenia in 2 vs. 3, and infections (SOC) in 3 vs 0 
patients. It is also noted that ECG QT prolongation was the cause for eribulin withdrawal in one patient in 
Study 309 (none in the dacarbazine arm). 
The overall frequency of treatment discontinuation due to AE was higher in the eribulin arm compared 
with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 4.9%).  
Supportive safety data 
This study evaluated therapy with single-agent eribulin mesylate for first-line treatment in subjects with 
previously untreated locally recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

Table 51: Study 206 Safety summary based on TEAES ≥ 25 of patients, including SAEs, treatment-related 
TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
Serious AEs reported in more than one subject in Study 206 were febrile neutropenia (n=3; 5.4%), 
neutropenia (n=3; 5.4%), and pulmonary embolism (n=2; 3.6%). Two deaths occurred. Both deaths 
occurred more than 30 days after the subject received her last dose of eribulin mesylate. One was 
attributed to disease progression. The second subject died due to pericardial and pleural effusion, 
reported by the investigator to be not related to study drug. Although the death occurred more than 30 
days after last dose of eribulin mesylate, the onset date of the event was during the study treatment 
period. There were no clinically relevant trends in group mean/median lab or vital sign values over time. 
No subject had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of Grade 3 
or 4 during the study and one subject had a shift of two grades (Grade 0 to Grade 2) from Baseline to 
worst value during treatment. A total of 33 subjects had an abnormal ECG finding some time during 
treatment, which was clinically significant in 3 subjects. A total of 23 subjects had an abnormal ECG 
finding at the end of treatment, which was clinically significant in 1 subject. Two subjects had QT 
prolongation (one Grade 2, possibly related, study drug interrupted, recovered; one Grade 3, probably 
related, study drug discontinued, not recovered).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Sarcoma 
STS vs MBC 
The overall eribulin safety profile in the studied soft tissue sarcoma (STS) population was similar to that 
seen in the previously approved metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting. No new safety concerns have 
been identified. 
The mean and median duration of eribulin exposure are lower in the STS compared with the MBC 
population (median 12 vs. 16 weeks). Similarly, the cumulative eribulin dose is lower in the STS 
compared with the MBC population. This is most likely an effect of the efficacy in the respective 
indications. The absolute and relative dose intensity is slightly higher in the STS compared with the MBC 
population, indicating similar tolerability in the two indications. Dose reductions were slightly less 
frequent (25.7 vs. 30.5%), but could potentially be attributable to the shorter time on drug.  
For many ADRs, the AE frequencies were numerically or significantly lower in the STS setting compared to 
the MBC setting. This could at least partly be explained by a shorter duration of exposure.  
For a smaller number of ADRs, relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the STS compared with the 
MBC population. These include pyrexia (27 vs. 20%), stomatitis (17 vs 9%), and fatigue/asthenia (60 vs. 
51%). 
Eribulin vs. dacarbazine 
The duration of study drug exposure was numerically slightly longer in the eribulin arm compared with 
the dacarbazine comparator arm of the pivotal Study 309 (difference in means 3.7 weeks, difference in 
medians 1 week), likely reflecting the difference in efficacy. The relative dose intensity was numerically 
higher in the comparator arm, which could potentially reflect a difference in tolerability.  
Notable differences across arms in pivotal Study 309 for eribulin vs. dacarbazine (underlined when 
higher) included: pyrexia, 28 vs. 14%; nausea + vomiting, 59 vs. 70%; stomatitis, 14 vs. 5%; 
neutropenia AEs, 44 vs. 24%; thrombocytopenia, 6 vs. 28%; peripheral neuropathy, 37 vs. 15%; 
headache, 18 vs. 9%; dysgeusia, 8 vs. 2%; alopecia, 35 vs. 3%; and Infections and infestations SOC, 43 
vs. 28%. 
With regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the eribulin 
compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and peripheral neuropathy. 
Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine arm. In other parts 
grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.  
SAE frequencies were similar across arms of Study 309. Of the fatal AEs, 2 cases of fatal neutropenic 
sepsis and septic shock in the STS population were considered related to eribulin treatment following 
review of narratives; both occurred in the pivotal Study 309. In the dacarbazine arm, all deaths were due 
to disease progression.  
The overall frequency of treatment discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the eribulin arm compared 
with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 4.9%).Apart from infections as a group, no meaningful differences were 
found between arms at the individual PT/SOC levels with regard to TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation, 
however. 
For some of the major ADRs of eribulin, the frequencies were similar in the dacarbazine arm, e.g. 
fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia and diarrhoea.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 80/92 
 
  
  
ADRs with higher frequency in the eribulin arm that may have major impact on the B/R assessment 
include peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia and infections and stomatitis. Alopecia may also be of some 
importance.  
ADRs of specific interest 
Pyrexia 
In eribulin-treated patients of Study 309, the median duration of pyrexia was 2 days and events were of 
low grade in most cases (only 1% was grade ≥3). Pyrexia is therefore not considered likely to affect 
tolerability to an important extent. It is noted that while a large difference in overall frequency of pyrexia 
across arms in Study 309 was observed (28 vs 14%), the grade ≥ 3 frequencies were similar (<1%).  
Peripheral neuropathy 
The median time to onset of peripheral neuropathy appears shorter in the STS compared with the MBC 
population, around 20 weeks vs. 28 weeks. The reason for this is not obvious considering the similar 
values observed for e.g. dose intensity and relative dose intensity across the two populations, and also 
that breast cancer patients to a greater extent have received prior neurotoxic therapy with taxanes. 
However it is acknowledged that the smaller sample size in the STS (n= 226) compared with the MBC 
(n=1559) population may affect the estimates. 
The lower frequencies of grade ≥3 events in pivotal study 309 and the STS population generally 
compared with the MBC population may be due to the longer exposure time in the MBC and potentially 
also other differences between populations such as prior therapies. 
Similar to the MBC population the information on resolution of peripheral neuropathy is limited and the 
possibility of late reversibility of PN is still largely unknown. As part of the eribulin EU RMP, the MAH is 
currently conducting a study (E7389-A001-303) in order to generate information on the frequency and 
time to resolution of eribulin-induced or aggravated PN. The results of this study will provide more 
accurate data on the outcome of eribulin-induced PN (see RMP). 
Neutropenia 
Fatal cases of febrile neutropenia, neutropenic sepsis, sepsis and septic shock have been reported. Out of 
1963 breast cancer and soft tissue sarcoma patients who received eribulin at the recommended dose in 
clinical trials there was one fatal event each of neutropenic sepsis (0.1%) and febrile neutropenia (0.1%). 
In addition there were 3 fatal events of sepsis (0.2%) and one of septic shock (0.1%). 
Severe neutropenia may be managed by the use of G-CSF or equivalent at the physician’s discretion in 
accordance with relevant guidelines. 18% and 13% of eribulin treated patients received G-CSF in the two 
phase 3 breast cancer studies (Studies 305 and 301, respectively). In the phase 3 sarcoma study (Study 
309), 26% of the eribulin treated patients received G-CSF. 
QT prolongation 
A relevantly higher incidence of QT prolongation was observed in both arms of Study 309, and in the STS, 
compared with the MBC population. There was no obvious explanation for this finding, as pre-treatment 
with (cardiotoxic) anthracycline was an inclusion criterion in the pivotal breast cancer studies 305 and 
301, as well as in the sarcoma Study 309. It could be hypothesised that sarcoma patients might have 
received generally higher doses of anthracycline due to different treatment practices in the two 
indications, leading to larger variability in transduction in myocardia, but no data to substantiate that 
notion have been presented. As the frequency in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 is similar to the 
frequency in the eribulin-treated overall STS population, no strong signal is considered received by the 
1.7% difference between arms in Study 309, however. 
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 81/92 
 
  
  
To date, the QT prolonging potential of eribulin has not been definitively investigated, since a thorough 
QTc study could not be performed for this cytotoxic agent and the dedicated QT Study 110, which was an 
uncontrolled open-label ECG study in 26 patients, could not exclude an effect on QT. In addition, the Non-
Clinical data available at market authorisation were non-informative due to poor tolerability in animals. 
The current SmPC text regarding QT prolongation refers to Study 110 and gives precautions for use. 
Electrolytes 
Low potassium and low phosphorous was observed in higher frequency in the eribulin treated STS-
population compared with the MBC population, as well as in eribulin-treated patients compared with 
dacarbazine-treated patients in the pivotal study. The causes for this are unknown.  
Liver function tests 
Liver function tests abnormalities were generally (i.e. for ALT, AST ALP) less common in the STS setting 
compared with the MBC setting. Total bilirubin was slightly more frequent in Study 309 (1.8%, n= 4), but 
similar in the overall STS population (1%) compared with the MBC population (0.8%). Low albumin was 
seen more frequently in the STS population (2.2%) compared with 0.9% in the MBC, but also in the 
pivotal study. 
Compared with the dacarbazine control arm, AST and bilirubin abnormalities were numerically higher, and 
ALT and ALP abnormalities numerically lower.  
In conclusion, no important differences in liver function tests were observed for eribulin vs. dacarbazine 
in the STS setting. Compared with the MBC setting liver function tests abnormalities were generally less 
frequent (possibly due to shorter duration of exposure). 
Subgroups 
The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic/anatomic subgroups and observed 
differences may likely be the result of differences in exposure and/or underlying disease characteristics. 
There were 151 male patients treated with eribulin in the STS studies, thus constituting 37% of the STS 
population and 8% of the combined STS+MBC population (Integrated safety population). 
Analyses of AEs by sex are confounded by the indications, ADI and LMS, which had different proportions 
of men and women as well as different treatment effect and time on therapy. In addition, differences in 
baseline characteristics in the STS population indicated slightly poorer prognosis in women compared with 
men (higher tumour grade, higher ECOG performance status, larger number of prior chemotherapy 
regimens). When this is taken into account, no important differences in safety profile across sexes are 
seen. 
In an analysis of patients divided by age < 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years of age, only small differences (0.1-
3%) were seen in the overall AE frequencies in the STS and the MBC populations. The only larger 
differences were seen in the STS population for fatal SAEs (n= 8/314; 2.5% vs. 6/90; 6.7%) and for 
TEAEs leading to study drug being withdrawn (n=13; 4.1% vs. n= 8; 8.9%). The numbers are small, 
however, and tolerability appears overall largely similar irrespective of age. On the basis of PK and safety 
data, no specific dose adjustments are recommended based on the age of the subject. 
As 18% (n=283/1559) of the patients in the MBC population and 22% (n=90/404) in the STS population 
were aged ≥ 65 years, “elderly” has now been removed as missing information in the RMP.  
Study 206 
The breast cancer study 206, evaluating eribulin as first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer, was 
not previously submitted and was therefore assessed in this procedure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 82/92 
 
  
  
An unusually high incidence of treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy (61%) in Study 206 compared 
with the overall MBC population (41%) was noted. The relatively small increases in duration of exposure 
in Study 206 (median 137 days; 7 cycles) compared with studies 301 (125 days; 6 cycles) and 305 (118 
days; 5 cycles) might provide an explanation. The considerably higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy 
in Study 206 could also, at least in part, be a chance finding due to the relatively small sample size (n= 
56). 
Drug-drug interactions 
No AEs of drug interaction were reported in Study 309, Study 207 or Study 217. Nonclinical in vitro 
studies indicate CYP3A4 as the major pathway for eribulin mesilate metabolism, and a low potential for 
clinical drug-drug interactions caused by eribulin mesilate via inhibition or induction. 
Until further data are available, concomitant medications that are metabolized through liver CYP3A4 
pathways that have a narrow therapeutic window should be used with caution with eribulin mesilate. In 
addition, drugs (including herbal supplements or grapefruit juice) that demonstrate potent CYP3A4 
inhibition or CYP3A4 induction should be administered with caution, at a low dose whenever possible. 
SmPC 
The new table of ADRs in the SmPC, section 4.8 is based on the combined STS and MBC populations. For 
some ADRs the frequencies have therefore decreased. As the STS comprises only 21% of the total safety 
population, the decreases are small, however. Important differences across therapeutic settings are 
adequately reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concerns were identified for eribulin in the STS setting compared with the previously 
approved MBC setting. Eribulin ADRs of importance to the B/R assessment include peripheral neuropathy, 
neutropenia and infections, stomatitis and alopecia. For some major ADRs of eribulin, the frequencies 
were similar in the dacarbazine arm of Study 309, e.g. fatigue/asthenia, musculo-/skeletal pain, anaemia 
and diarrhoea. The dacarbazine arm had more nausea and vomiting and thrombocytopenia. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The application formally rests on the pivotal 309 study: a randomized (1:1), open-label, multi-centre, 
Phase III study comparing eribulin (n=228) to dacarbazine (n=224) in patients previously treated for 
locally advanced and/or metastatic tumours of either the adipocytic subtype (liposarcoma [ADI]) or of 
smooth muscle origin (leiomyosarcoma [LMS]). The primary endpoint was OS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/147213/2017 
Page 87/92 
 
  
  
 
The study met its primary objective with an estimated reduction of death of 23 % in favour of eribulin to 
that of the control (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.618, 0.954]; p=0.017) with a median gain of 2 months (13.5 
months and 11.5 months respectively).  
As the subgroup analyses for OS and PFS clearly indicated a differential benefit between the ADI and LMS 
(ADI [OS HR 0.51; PFS HR 0.52] vs. LMS [OS HR 0.9; PFS HR 1.1]), separate baseline and outcome data 
for the two subtypes including subgroup analyses were requested:  
Adipocytic sarcoma (ADI) 
It is concluded that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by the patients with the 
ADI subtype (HR 0.51 (95% CI 0.346, 0.753), P=0.0006) with a median OS of about 16 months for the 
eribulin arm compared with approximately 8 months for the dacarbazine arm. In addition, a benefit in 
PFS for this subtype can be observed (median 2.9 months vs. 1.7 months in the dacarbazine arm with a 
HR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.346; 0.784, P=0.0015). 
The different subtypes of ADI (dedifferentiated, mixed/round cell or pleomorphic) may be viewed as 
biologically different but the small sample size and absence of preformed hypotheses make further 
analyses less than meaningful. Thus it is accepted that activity has been shown irrespective of ADI 
subtype.   
Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) 
Evidence of a benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has not been shown in the LMS population. No 
difference at all between the two treatment arms is observed. The HR is 0.93 (95% CI 0.714, 1.203; 
P=0.57) for OS with a median of about 13 months in both arms. For PFS the HR is 1.07 (95% CI 0.835, 
1.375; P=0.585) with a similar median of about 2.5 months.  
The apparent difference, especially in PFS between uterine and non-uterine sarcoma is noticed. This is an 
unexpected finding from a tumour biology perspective as currently described and from the perspective of 
“non-activity” of dacarbazine and eribulin is rather interpreted as reflecting differences in baseline 
prognostic factors.  
The MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS. If this 
actually was the case, i.e. that similarity in PFS (HR 1.07) reflected a meaningful delay in progression for 
both study arms vs. a virtual placebo, then it would be expected that post progression survival would be 
prolonged in the eribulin arm, analogous to findings in breast cancer and ADI. This is however not the 
case. Therefore, the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is 
meaningfully active in LMS. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In the overall population there is a lack of substantial support of a benefit of eribulin compared to 
dacarbazine in STS aside from the demonstrated OS gain. The mechanistic rationale to the differential 
benefit between ADI and LMS is lacking. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The eribulin safety profile in the studied soft tissue sarcoma (STS) population (Studies 309, 217 and 207) 
was generally similar to that seen in the previously approved metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting. No 
new safety concerns were identified.  
For many ADRs, the AE frequencies were numerically or significantly lower in the STS setting compared to 
the MBC setting. This could at least partly be explained by a shorter duration of exposure. For a smaller 
Assessment report

number of ADRs, relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the STS compared with the MBC population. 
These include pyrexia (27 vs. 20%), stomatitis (17 vs 9%), and fatigue/asthenia (60 vs. 51%).  
Notable differences across arms in pivotal Study 309 for eribulin vs. dacarbazine included: pyrexia, 28 vs. 
14%; nausea + vomiting, 59 vs. 70%; stomatitis, 14 vs. 5%; neutropenia, 44 vs. 24%; neutropenia 
including laboratory abnormalities, 70 vs 43%; thrombocytopenia, 6 vs. 28%; peripheral neuropathy, 37 
vs. 15%; headache, 18 vs. 9%; dysgeusia, 8 vs. 2%; alopecia, 35 vs. 3%; and Infections and 
infestations SOC, 43 vs. 28%. 
For some ADRs related to tolerability the AE frequencies were similar across study arms. These include 
fatigue/asthenia (65 vs. 61%), musculo-/skeletal pain (46 vs. 40%), anaemia (30 vs. 31%) and 
diarrhoea (17 vs 16%). 
The incidence of pyrexia in eribulin-treated patients in Study309 was highest (14-12%) in the first two 
cycles, following which the incidence decreased substantially. Median duration was 2 days and only 1% 
was grade ≥3, making these events less likely to affect the overall tolerability.  
With regard to severe TEAEs (toxicity grade ≥ 3), relevantly higher frequencies were seen in the eribulin 
compared with the dacarbazine arm of Study 309 for neutropenia, infections, and peripheral neuropathy. 
Severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia were relevantly higher in the dacarbazine arm. In other parts 
grade ≥ 3 toxicities were comparable across arms.  
SAE frequencies were similar across arms of Study 309. There were 2 vs. 0 treatment-related deaths in 
the eribulin vs. dacarbazine arm. These were due to neutropenic sepsis and septic shock. Treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs was higher in the eribulin arm compared with the dacarbazine arm (7.5 vs 
4.9%). However apart from infections as a group, no meaningful differences were found between arms at 
the individual PT/SOC levels with regard to TEAEs leading to drug discontinuation,. 
The safety profile of eribulin appears similar in the different histologic and histologic-anatomic subgroups 
(ADI, LMS; Uterine LMS, Non-uterine LMS) and the observed differences across subgroups may be the 
result of differences in exposure and/or in the underlying disease. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Currently the QT prolonging potential of eribulin is unknown, since no thorough QTc study has been 
performed and the Non-Clinical available data at market authorisation were non-informative due to poor 
tolerability in animals. The current SmPC text regarding QT prolongation refers to an uncontrolled open-
label ECG study in 26 patients and gives precautions for use. 
Similar to the MBC population the information on resolution of peripheral neuropathy is limited and the 
possibility of late reversibility of peripheral neuropathy is still largely unknown. As part of the eribulin EU 
RMP, the MAH is currently conducting a study in order to generate information on the frequency and time 
to resolution of eribulin-induced or aggravated peripheral neuropathy.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While a statistically significant benefit in OS in the overall population has been demonstrated in favour of 
eribulin vs. dacarbazine with a reduction of death of 23 %, it becomes clear based on subgroup analyses 
per histology subtype that the OS benefit for eribulin over dacarbazine is entirely driven by the patients 
with the ADI subtype with a reduction of death of about 50 % and approximately 8 months median gain.

Important ADRs of eribulin that had relevantly higher incidence in the eribulin compared with the 
dacarbazine arm of Study 309 included peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, infections, stomatitis and 
alopecia. 
Neutropenia is routinely managed by oncologists and may as such be of less importance to the B/R 
balance, except in cases of hospitalisation due to e.g. febrile neutropenia. Infections related to 
neutropenia are of concern, however, and eribulin is associated with deaths due to infections in a few 
percent of patients; less than 1 percent in the present sarcoma setting. Peripheral neuropathy is 
debilitating and unpleasant (sometimes painful), and may affect patients’ activities of daily living and 
quality of life. Stomatitis is a painful condition that affects the possibility to eat normal food and quality of 
life.  
Benefit-risk balance 
A differential benefit between ADI and LMS was identified in the pre-planned subgroup analysis. In 
further requested analyses, a benefit in OS and PFS favouring eribulin over dacarbazine was convincingly 
shown in the ADI population and it is accepted that activity has been shown irrespective of ADI subtype 
(dedifferentiated, mixed/round cell or pleomorphic). 
There is no evidence that eribulin has a superior efficacy over dacarbazine in the LMS population.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Due to the overall rarity of STS and the heterogeneity within in terms of histology, the challenges in 
performing large randomised studies are recognised. Hence a regimen that can demonstrate an OS 
benefit would meet a high medical need.  
Although the 309 study met its primary objective with an estimated reduction of death of 23 % in favour 
of eribulin in the overall population, the subgroup analysis identified a differential response between the 
two subtypes. A benefit of eribulin over dacarbazine has convincingly been demonstrated in the ADI 
subtype which is of high clinical relevance. This however, has not been shown in the LMS population. The 
MAH has been unable to provide evidence that dacarbazine is meaningfully active in LMS and therefore 
the most reasonable interpretation is that neither dacarbazine nor eribulin is meaningfully active in LMS. 
As the post progression and therefore post treatment effects on survival are of major interest, further 
studies are strongly encouraged.  
The initially proposed indication encompassed STS not subtype specified. The MAH proposed a revised 
indication: 
HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma or 
leiomyosarcoma who have received prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see 
section 5.1). 
This has not been accepted as no benefit has been demonstrated in LMS. Moreover, “prior systemic 
therapy” should reflect that standard chemotherapy is based on anthracyclines as the 1st line treatment. 
The following wording has been proposed: 
HALAVEN is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable liposarcoma or 
leiomyosarcoma who have received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) 
systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (see section 5.1). 
Conclusion 
The B/R is considered positive exclusively in the ADI population.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of unresectable liposarcoma in adult patients who have 
received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease; as 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated with the PK, efficacy 
and safety information. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated in accordance. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 9.1. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus  is of the opinion that Halaven (eribulin) is not similar to Yondelis (trabectedin) 
within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include the treatment of unresectable liposarcoma in adult patients who have 
received prior anthracycline containing therapy (unless unsuitable) for advanced or metastatic disease; as 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated with the PK, efficacy 
and safety information. The Package Leaflet and RMP are updated in accordance. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 9.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CINQAERO is indicated as add-on therapy in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma 
inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for 
maintenance treatment (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
CINQAERO should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of the 
above-mentioned indication (see section 4.1). 
Posology 
CINQAERO is given as intravenous infusion once every four weeks. 
Patients below 35 kg or above 199 kg 
The recommended dose is 3 mg/kg body weight. The volume (in mL) required from the vial(s) should 
be calculated as follows: 0.3 x patient body weight (in kg). 
Patients between 35 kg and 199 kg

Treatment duration 
CINQAERO is intended for long-term treatment. 
A decision to continue the therapy should be made at least annually based on disease severity and 
level of exacerbation control. 
Missed dose 
If a reslizumab infusion is missed on the planned date, dosing should resume as soon as possible on 
the indicated dose and regimen. A double dose must not be administered to make up for a missed dose. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There are limited data available on the use of reslizumab in patients older than 75 years of age. Based 
on the similar reslizumab exposure observed in patients older than 65 years of age as compared to 
patients 18 to <65 years of age, no dose adjustment is recommended (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety and efficacy of CINQAERO in children and adolescents aged up to 17 years have not been 
established. 
No data are available for children aged up to 11 years. Currently available data in adolescents from 12 
to 17 years are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made. 
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
This medicinal product is for intravenous infusion only. It must not be administered by the 
subcutaneous, oral or intramuscular route. 
The appropriate volume of concentrate should be dispensed into an infusion bag containing 50 mL 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
This medicinal product must not be administered as a bolus injection or as undiluted concentrate. 
The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a hypersensitivity reaction to 
reslizumab or to any of the excipients (see section 4.4). 
Instructions for administration 
1. 
CINQAERO should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 4.4). The patient has to be 
observed over the duration of the infusion and for an appropriate period afterwards. Patients 
should be instructed on how to recognise symptoms of serious allergic reactions. 
If the solution for infusion has been stored in a refrigerator, allow it to reach room temperature 
(15 °C-25 °C). 
The solution for infusion should be infused intravenously over 20 – 50 minutes. Infusion time 
may vary depending on the total volume to be infused. 
The solution for infusion should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with 
other medicinal products. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been 
conducted to evaluate the co-administration of reslizumab with other medicinal products. 
An infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, single-use, low-protein-binding filter 
(pore size of 0.2 µm) should be used for infusion. CINQAERO is compatible with 
polyethersulfone (PES), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nylon, cellulose acetate (CA) low 
protein binding in-line infusion filters. 
Upon completion of the infusion, flush the infusion set with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for infusion to ensure that all of the CINQAERO solution for infusion has been 
administered.

For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Reslizumab should not be used to treat acute asthma exacerbations. 
Asthma-related symptoms or exacerbations may occur during treatment. Patients should be instructed 
to seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment. 
Traceability 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity and administration-related reactions 
Acute systemic reactions, including anaphylactic reactions, have been reported in association with 
reslizumab (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions were observed during or within 20 minutes after 
completion of the infusion. Patients should be monitored during and for an appropriate time after 
administration of reslizumab. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, administration of reslizumab should 
be stopped immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be provided; reslizumab must be 
discontinued permanently (see section 4.3). 
Parasitic (helminth) infections 
Eosinophils may be involved in the immunological response to some helminth infections. Patients 
with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before starting reslizumab therapy. If patients 
become infected whilst receiving treatment with reslizumab and do not respond to anti-helminth 
treatment, temporary discontinuation of therapy should be considered. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains 4.6 mg sodium per vial of 10 mL (1.15 mg sodium per vial of 2.5 
mL), equivalent to 0.23% (0.06%) of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium 
for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal clinical interaction studies have been performed with reslizumab. In vitro data indicate that 
IL-5 and reslizumab are unlikely to affect CYP1A2, 3A4 or 2B6 activity. Based on the characteristics 
of reslizumab, interactions are not expected. Results of population pharmacokinetic analysis confirm 
that concomitant use of either leukotriene antagonists or systemic corticosteroids does not affect the 
pharmacokinetics of reslizumab (see section 5.2). 
Reslizumab has not been studied in patients concurrently taking immunosuppressant medicinal 
products other than oral corticosteroids (OCS); therefore, the safety and efficacy profile of reslizumab 
in these patients is unknown. 
Reslizumab has not been studied in patients receiving live vaccines. No data are available on the 
secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving 
reslizumab or the response to new immunisations in patients receiving reslizumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of reslizumab 
in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of CINQAERO during pregnancy. 
Reslizumab has a long half-life (see section 5.2). This should be taken into consideration. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether reslizumab is excreted in human milk. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of reslizumab in milk. In 
humans, during the first few days after birth, antibodies may be transferred to the newborns through 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
milk. In this short period, a risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Afterwards, CINQAERO 
could be used during breast-feeding if appropriate. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. Available non-clinical data do not suggest an effect on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CINQAERO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are increased blood creatine phosphokinase 
(approximately 2% of patients) and anaphylactic reaction (see section 4.4) (less than 1% of patients). 
During controlled clinical studies, the proportion of patients who discontinued due to any adverse 
reaction was 1% for both the 3 mg/kg reslizumab and placebo groups. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported with reslizumab during placebo-controlled asthma 
studies for up to 52 weeks of treatment with a 3 mg/kg dose given intravenously. Adverse reactions 
are listed below in Table 2 by system organ class and frequency (frequencies are defined as: very 
common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Anaphylactic reaction 
The serious adverse reaction of anaphylactic reaction was reported and considered related to 
reslizumab in 3 patients (0.19%) during placebo-controlled and open-label asthma studies. These 
reactions were observed during or within 20 minutes after completion of the reslizumab infusion and 
were reported as early as the second dose of reslizumab. They were fully resolved with standard 
treatment with no residual effect. Manifestations included skin or mucosal involvement, dyspnoea, 
wheezing, gastrointestinal symptoms and chills. These cases resulted in the discontinuation of 
treatment. Due to an overlap in signs and symptoms, it was not possible to distinguish between an 
anaphylactic reaction, another hypersensitivity reaction and an infusion-related reaction in all cases 
(see section 4.4). 
Myalgia 
Myalgia was reported in 0.97% of patients (10 out of 1,028) in the 3 mg/kg reslizumab group of the 
placebo-controlled asthma studies compared with 0.55% of patients (4 out of 730) in the placebo 
group. 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood creatine phosphokinase elevations were transient and asymptomatic, and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation. 
Malignancies 
In placebo-controlled clinical studies, 6 out of 1,028 patients (0.6%) receiving 3 mg/kg reslizumab had 
at least one malignant neoplasm reported compared to 2 out of 730 patients (0.3%) in the placebo 
group. The malignancies observed in reslizumab-treated patients were diverse in nature and without 
clustering of any particular tissue type. 
Paediatric population 
Experience in paediatric patients is limited (see section 5.1). The data did not indicate a difference in 
the safety profile of reslizumab in paediatric patients compared with that in adult patients. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest single dose administered intravenously was reported at 12.1 mg/kg and had no clinical 
consequences for the patient. In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for 
any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and given appropriate symptomatic treatment.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, other systemic drugs for 
obstructive airway diseases; ATC code: R03DX08 
Mechanism of action 
Reslizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG4, κ) against the human interleukin-5 (IL-5). 
Reslizumab binds specifically to IL-5 and interferes with IL-5 binding to its cell-surface receptor. IL-5 
is a key cytokine responsible for the differentiation, maturation, recruitment and activation of human 
eosinophils. Reslizumab binds human IL-5 with picomolar affinity blocking its biological function; 
consequently survival and activity of eosinophils are reduced. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Effect on sputum eosinophils 
The effect of reslizumab in patients with asthma and elevated sputum eosinophil counts (at least 3%) 
was evaluated in a 15-week, phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study with 
reslizumab 3 mg/kg. Sputum eosinophils were measured in a subset of 38 adult patients at the end of 
therapy. In this study, the percentage of sputum eosinophils was reduced from a mean baseline value 
of 17.4% (standard deviation: 15.9%) by 82% at end of therapy in the reslizumab group. 
Effect on blood eosinophils 
In clinical studies I and II with reslizumab 3 mg/kg, decreases in blood eosinophil counts were seen 
following the first dose and maintained through 52 weeks of treatment with no signs of tachyphylaxis. 
In pooled data, mean eosinophil counts were 655 µL-1 (n=476) and 654 µL-1 (n=477) for the placebo 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and reslizumab treatment groups at baseline and were 514 µL-1 (n=405) and 61 µL-1 (n=407) at 
week 52. Eosinophils began to return towards baseline in those reslizumab patients completing a 
90-day follow-up assessment (394 µL-1, n=36). Decreases in blood eosinophils were related to 
reslizumab levels. 
The reduction in blood eosinophil counts by reslizumab in anti-reslizumab antibody-positive patients 
was not different from patients who were anti-reslizumab antibody-negative. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Overview of clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of reslizumab in eosinophilic asthma (blood eosinophils ≥400 µL-1) was evaluated in 
three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (studies I to III) from 16 to 52 weeks’ 
duration involving 1268 patients with moderate to severe asthma inadequately controlled on medium- 
to high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (at least 440 μg of fluticasone propionate daily or 
equivalent) with or without other controllers; prior stable allergen immunotherapy was allowed. 
Studies I and II were 52-week, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in patients who had at least one 
asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroid use over the past twelve months. Maintenance 
OCS (up to 10 mg per day prednisone equivalent) were allowed. The patients received either 13 doses 
of placebo or reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks. 
Study III was a 16-week, randomised, placebo-controlled study. There was no prior asthma 
exacerbation requirement for this study. Maintenance OCS was not allowed. The patients received 
either four doses of placebo or reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks. 
Table 3 presents the demographics and baseline characteristics of studies I, II and III.

d The percentage of patients with refractory asthma (based on the American Thoracic Society 
[ATS]/European Respiratory Society [ERS] 2000 workshop definition for refractory asthma) from 
studies I and II was analysed post hoc. 
Studies I and II 
The primary efficacy measure for both studies I and II was the frequency of asthma exacerbations for 
each patient during the 52-week treatment period. In both studies, an asthma exacerbation was defined 
as a worsening of asthma that required the following medical intervention:  
1) use of systemic corticosteroids or an increase in the use of ICS treatment for 3 or more days, and/or  
2) asthma-related emergency treatment including at least one of the following: an unscheduled visit to 
their healthcare professional for nebuliser treatment or other urgent treatment to prevent worsening of 
asthma symptoms; a visit to the emergency room for asthma-related treatment; or asthma-related 
hospitalisation. 
Overall population 
In studies I and II, patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had significant reductions in asthma 
exacerbations (50% and 59%, respectively) compared to placebo (see Table 4). The overall reduction 
was 54%.

b CI = Confidence interval 
In the subset of patients requiring courses of OCS treatment for management of their asthma 
exacerbation, reslizumab was shown to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations by 56% 
(p<0.0001) and 60% (p<0.0001) in study I and study II, respectively. A reduction in asthma 
exacerbations resulting in hospitalisation or an emergency room visit was observed with reslizumab 
3 mg/kg that was not statistically significant (34% [p=0.2572] and 31% [p=0.4020] in study I and 
study II, respectively). 
The proportion of patients who did not experience an asthma exacerbation during the 52-week 
treatment period was higher in the reslizumab 3 mg/kg group (62% and 75%) compared with the 
placebo group (46% and 55%), in studies I and II, respectively. 
Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma 
In studies I and II, severe eosinophilic asthma is defined as any patients falling into GINA 
steps 4 and 5 (medium- to high-dose ICS [≥ 440 µg fluticasone propionate] plus another controller, 
with or without maintenance OCS) with a blood eosinophil count of ≥400 µL-1 at start of treatment. A 
cohort of 763 patients within studies I and II met this criterion; the primary efficacy outcome is 
presented in Table 4. In integrated studies I and II, patients receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had 
significant reductions in asthma exacerbations (56% for subgroup GINA 4 and 5) compared to 
placebo. 
The effect of reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered once every 4 weeks on secondary endpoints, including 
FEV1, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and 
Asthma Symptom Utility Index (ASUI), further supports the efficacy of reslizumab 3 mg/kg compared 
to placebo. Improvements were observed as early as 4 weeks following the first dose of reslizumab 
(AQLQ at 16 weeks) and sustained through week 52. 
Results for FEV1, ACQ and AQLQ are shown in Table 5 below for the overall population, and 
subgroup GINA 4 and 5.

Patients with severe refractory eosinophilic asthma 
Reslizumab produced significant reductions in asthma exacerbations relative to placebo in the 
refractory population (59%) and non-refractory population (49%). Results were supported by the 
secondary efficacy endpoints and were in line with the overall population. 
Study III 
The primary endpoint was the change from baseline over 16 weeks in FEV1. In study III, patients 
receiving reslizumab 3 mg/kg had significantly larger increases in FEV1 from baseline compared to 
placebo (treatment difference: 160 mL, p=0.0018). Improvements were noted in FEV1 at 4 weeks 
following the first dose of reslizumab. 
Immunogenicity 
In phase 3 placebo-controlled studies with a duration of 16 to 52 weeks, low-titre, frequently transient 
anti-reslizumab antibodies were detected in 53 out of 983 asthma patients (5%) receiving reslizumab 
at 3 mg/kg. In an open-label phase 3 extension study, low-titre, frequently transient anti-reslizumab 
antibodies were detected in 49 out of 1,014 asthma patients (5%) who received 3 mg/kg reslizumab for 
up to 36 months. Systemic exposure to reslizumab appears to be unaffected by anti-reslizumab 
antibodies. The antibodies had no impact on clinical pharmacodynamics, efficacy or safety. 
Ethnicity 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is not 
significantly different between ethnic groups (white, black and Asian). There are limited safety data in 
non-white ethnic populations. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
CINQAERO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in asthma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
39 paediatric asthma patients from 12 to 17 years were randomised to reslizumab 0.3 mg/kg, 
reslizumab 3 mg/kg or placebo as part of two 52-week exacerbation studies (studies I and II) and one 
16-week lung function study (study III). In studies I and II only, patients were required to have at least 
one asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroid use in the year prior to study entry. Asthma 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exacerbations were evaluated only in the exacerbation studies (studies I and II: reslizumab 3 mg/kg 
[n=14] and placebo [n=11]). No treatment effect on asthma exacerbations was observed for this age 
group (asthma exacerbation rate ratio [reslizumab/placebo] of 2.09). Given the small sample size and 
baseline imbalances resulting from subgroup analysis, no conclusion can be drawn regarding asthma 
efficacy in the paediatric population. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Peak serum concentrations of approximately 80 µg/mL are typically observed at the end of the 
infusion. Serum reslizumab concentrations generally decline from peak in a biphasic manner. 
Following multiple doses, serum concentrations of reslizumab accumulate approximately 1.5- to 
1.9-fold. No apparent deviation from dose-proportional reslizumab pharmacokinetics was noted over 
the dose range of 0.3 mg/kg to 3.0 mg/kg. Inter-individual variability in peak and overall exposure is 
approximately 20-30% 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, systemic exposure to reslizumab appears to be 
unaffected by circulating anti-reslizumab antibodies. 
Distribution 
Reslizumab has a volume of distribution of approximately 5 L, suggesting minimal distribution to the 
extravascular tissues. 
Biotransformation 
In common with other monoclonal antibodies, reslizumab is believed to be degraded by enzymatic 
proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids. As reslizumab binds to a soluble target, linear 
non-target-mediated clearance is expected. 
Elimination 
Reslizumab clearance is approximately 7 mL/hour. Reslizumab has a half-life of about 24 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was similar in adults (18-65 years of age; n=759) and elderly 
patients (greater than 65 years of age; n=30). 
Paediatric population 
The range of systemic exposures in patients from 12 to less than 18 years of age (n=15) overlapped 
that in the other groups although the median value was slightly lower than in adult patients 
(18-65 years of age; n=759) and elderly patients (greater than 65 years of age; n=30). 
Gender 
The pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was not significantly different between males and females. 
Ethnicity 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is not 
significantly different between ethnic groups (white, black and Asian). 
Hepatic impairment 
Reslizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No direct effect of hepatic 
function on the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab is expected because antibodies are principally cleared 
by catabolism. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, patients were classified by baseline liver 
function levels. Most patients had normal liver function tests (n=766, approximately 95%) or mildly 
increased liver function tests (either, in the first case, total bilirubin above the upper limit of normal 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[ULN] but less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN or, in the second case, aspartate aminotransferase 
greater than the ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to the ULN; n=35, approximately 4%). No 
significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab was observed across these groups. 
Renal impairment 
Reslizumab is an antibody with a molecular mass of 147 kDaltons and is therefore not expected to be 
excreted in urine. Most patients in the population pharmacokinetic analysis had normal renal function 
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) greater than or equal to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=294, 
approximately 37%), mild renal impairment (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=446, approximately 
56%), or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2; n=63, approximately 8%). No 
noteworthy differences in the pharmacokinetics of reslizumab were observed across these renal 
function groups. Reslizumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment or end 
stage renal disease. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to 
reproduction and development.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CINQAERO is and what it is used for 
What CINQAERO is 
CINQAERO contains the active substance reslizumab, a monoclonal antibody, a type of protein that 
recognises and binds to a specific target substance in the body. 
What CINQAERO is used for 
CINQAERO is used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma in adult patients (18 years of age and over) 
when the condition is not well controlled despite treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids 
together with another asthma medicine. Eosinophilic asthma is a type of asthma where patients have 
too many eosinophils in the blood or lungs. CINQAERO is used together with other medicines to treat 
asthma (inhaled corticosteroids plus other asthma medicines). 
How CINQAERO works 
CINQAERO blocks interleukin-5 activity and reduces the number of eosinophils in your blood and 
lungs. Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in asthma inflammation. Interleukin-5 is a protein 
your body makes that plays a key role in inflammation in asthma by activating eosinophils. 
What are the benefits of using CINQAERO 
CINQAERO reduces how often you have flare-ups of your asthma, helps you breathe better and 
decreases your asthma symptoms. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given CINQAERO 
You must not receive CINQAERO: 
- 
if you are allergic to reslizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given CINQAERO: 
- 
if you have a parasitic infection or if you live in an area where parasitic infections are common 
or if you are travelling to such a region, as this medicine may weaken your body’s ability to 
fight certain types of parasitic infections. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, talk to your doctor or nurse when you are given CINQAERO: 
- 
- 
if your asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens during treatment with this medicine; 
if you have any of the symptoms of an allergic reaction (e.g. itching, trouble breathing, 
wheezing, fever, shivering, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, skin 
rash, redness or swelling). Serious allergic reactions have occurred in patients receiving this 
medicine (see section “4. Possible side effects”). 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is NOT intended for use in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and CINQAERO 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
This is particularly important: 
- 
- 
if you are receiving other medicines which affect your immune system; 
if you have recently received a vaccination or if you are likely to need a vaccination. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
The active substance in this medicine may pass into breast milk but only during the first few days after 
birth. 
Driving and using machines 
It is unlikely that CINQAERO will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
CINQAERO contains sodium 
This medicine contains 4.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial of 10 mL, 
and 1.15 mg sodium in each vial of 2.5 mL. This is equivalent to 0.23% and 0.06%, respectively, of 
the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How CINQAERO is given 
Always follow the instructions exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are 
not sure. 
The dose depends on your body weight. Your doctor will work out the right dose for you. The 
maximum dose is 3 mg per kg of body weight. CINQAERO will be given every 4 weeks. You will be 
given CINQAERO by a doctor or nurse as an infusion (drip) into a vein. The infusion will take about 
20 to 50 minutes. 
Your doctor or nurse will watch you closely during and after your infusion for signs of an allergic 
reaction. 
If you miss your scheduled dose of CINQAERO 
If you miss a scheduled dose of CINQAERO, ask your doctor when to schedule your next treatment. 
If you stop using CINQAERO 
Do NOT stop treatment with CINQAERO unless your doctor tells you to, even if you feel better. 
Interrupting or stopping treatment with this medicine may cause your asthma symptoms to come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
• 
Serious allergic reactions 
Serious allergic reactions can happen uncommonly (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) while 
receiving CINQAERO or afterwards. Your doctor or nurse will watch you closely for signs of a 
reaction. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of the symptoms of an allergic 
reaction (e.g. itching, trouble breathing, wheezing, fever, shivering, dizziness, headache, nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal discomfort, skin rash, redness or swelling). 
Other side effects 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
Increase of an enzyme in your blood (blood creatine phosphokinase). 
Uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
• 
Muscle pain (myalgia). 
Reporting of side effects

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
CINQAERO is provided as a concentrate for solution for infusion in a single-use vial. The solution for 
infusion is intended only for intravenous use after dilution and should be prepared using aseptic 
technique as follows: 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Preparation of solution for infusion 
1. 
2. 
Remove CINQAERO from the refrigerator. Do not shake the vial. 
The medicinal product should be inspected visually before use. The concentrate is clear to 
slightly hazy opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow. Proteinaceous particles may be present in

the concentrate that appear as translucent to white, amorphous particles, some of which may 
look fibrous. This is not unusual for proteinaceous solutions. The concentrate must not be used 
if coloured (except slightly yellow) or if foreign particles are present. 
A suitable injection syringe should be used to withdraw the needed amount of concentrate from 
the vial(s) (see section 4.2 of Summary of Product Characteristics). 
Slowly dispense the contents of the syringe(s) into an infusion bag containing 50 mL of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. This 
medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion. 
Any concentrate remaining in the vial must be discarded. 
It is recommended that the solution for infusion be administered immediately after preparation. 
Solutions of CINQAERO diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for infusion may 
be stored refrigerated at 2 °C-8 °C (or not above 25 °C if dilution has taken place in controlled 
and validated aseptic conditions), protected from light for up to 16 hours. 
CINQAERO is compatible with polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) infusion bags.

Instructions for administration 
1. 
CINQAERO should be administered by a healthcare professional prepared to manage 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis (see section 4.4 of Summary of Product 
Characteristics). The patient has to be observed over the duration of the infusion and for an 
appropriate period afterwards. Patients should be instructed on how to recognise symptoms of 
serious allergic reactions. 
If the solution for infusion has been stored in a refrigerator, allow it to reach room temperature 
(15 °C-25 °C). 
The solution for infusion should be infused intravenously over 20 – 50 minutes. Infusion time 
may vary depending on the total volume to be infused. 
The solution for infusion should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with 
other medicinal products. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been 
conducted to evaluate the co-administration of reslizumab with other medicinal products. 
An infusion set with an in-line, sterile, non-pyrogenic, single-use, low-protein-binding filter 
(pore size of 0.2 µm) should be used for infusion. CINQAERO is compatible with 
polyethersulfone (PES), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), nylon, cellulose acetate (CA) low 
protein binding in-line infusion filters. 
Upon completion of the infusion, flush the infusion set with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for infusion to ensure that all of the CINQAERO solution for infusion has been 
administered.

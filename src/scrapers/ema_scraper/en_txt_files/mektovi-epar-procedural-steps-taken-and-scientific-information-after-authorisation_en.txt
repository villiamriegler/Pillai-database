SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Mektovi in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Note: The MAH in the course of the assessment 
withdrew Mektovi (binimetinib) from the applied 
indication. Therefore, the extension of indication only 
concerns the product Braftovi (encorafenib). 
Extension of indication to include encorafenib in 
combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have 
received prior systemic therapy, as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. The RMP version 2.0 is acceptable. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.1.

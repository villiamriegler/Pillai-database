Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for nalmefene, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period 12 cases of newly identified withdrawal syndrome following concomitant 
utilisation with buprenorphine and methadone have been identified. Currently nalmefene is 
contraindicated in patients taking opioid analgesics, therefore the contraindication should be updated to 
include patients taking opioids for substitution therapy with opioid agonists (e.g. methadone) or partial 
agonists (e.g. buprenorphine). 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding nalmefene, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for nalmefene the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing nalmefene is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

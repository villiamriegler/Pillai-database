Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Cubicin 
daptomycin 
On 22 October 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Cubicin. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Novartis Europharm Ltd. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows2:  
treatment of adults and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and 
soft-tissue infections (cSSTI).  
For information, the full indications for Cubicin will be as follows: 
“Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
•  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue 
infections (cSSTI). 
•  Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is 
recommended that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial 
susceptibility of the organism and should be based on expert advice. See sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
•  Adult patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) when associated with RIE or with 
cSSTI. 
Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections 
where Gram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, Cubicin should be 
co-administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing

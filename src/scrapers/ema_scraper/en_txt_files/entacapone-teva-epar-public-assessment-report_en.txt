Scientific discussion 
2.1 
Introduction 
Entacapone  Teva  is  indicated  as  an  adjunct  to  standard  preparations  of  levodopa/benserazide  or 
levodopa/carbidopa  for  use  in  adult  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease  and  end-of-dose  motor 
fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations 
Entacapone  functions  as  a  catechol-O-methyl  transferase  inhibitor  therefore  decreasing  in  the 
periphery  the  metabolic  loss  of  levodopa  to  3-  methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine  (3-OMD),  which 
does  not  easily  cross  the  blood  brain  barrier.  This  leads  to  a  higher  levodopa  AUC.  The  amount  of 
levodopa  available  to  the  brain  is  increased.  Entacapone  thus  prolongs  the  clinical  response  to 
levodopa.  It  is  used  in  the  treatment  of  Parkinson's  disease:  when  administered  in  conjunction  with 
dopaminergic agents such as L-DOPA. 
One  200  mg  tablet  is  taken  with  each  levodopa/dopa  decarboxylase  inhibitor  dose.  The  maximum 
recommended dose is 200 mg ten times daily, i.e. 2,000 mg of entacapone. 
Entacapone  decreases  the  metabolic  loss  of  levodopa  to  3-O-methyldopa  (3-OMD)  by  inhibiting  the 
COMT enzyme.  
Entacapone  Teva  200  mg  is  a  generic  200  mg  film-coated  tablet  packaged  in  HDPE  bottles  with  PP 
screw caps and with desiccant insert. Entacapone Teva is a generic of the centrally authorised Comtess 
200 mg film-coated tablets. 
The efficacy and safety of entacapone has been demonstrated in several controlled studies. A summary 
of these studies can be found in the EPAR of the reference product Comtess. 
The reference product was authorized in the Community on 16th September 1998 for Orion Corporation. 
Bioequivalence to the reference product from the United Kingdom market was demonstrated. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
2.2.1 Introduction 
Entacapone  Teva  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablet,  containing  200  mg  of  entacapone  as  the  active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are defined in the SPC section 6.1.   
The tablets are packaged in HDPE bottles with PP screw caps and with desiccant insert. 
2.2.2 Active Substance 
The active substance of Entacapone Teva is entacapone, which has the chemical name: (2E)-2-cyano-
3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N,N-diethylprop-2-enamide.  It  corresponds  to  the  molecular  formula 
C 14H 15N3O5  and  relative  molecular  mass  of  305.29.  It  appears  as  yellow  non-hygroscopic  crystalline 
powder,  practically  insoluble  in  water,  soluble  or  sparingly  soluble  in  acetone,  slightly  soluble  in 
anhydrous ethanol. 
Entacapone exhibits polymorphism as per the available literature. However based on the XRD spectra 
it is found that, entacapone manufactured by the active substance supplier is consistent regarding the 
polymorphic form.

Manufacture 
An  ASMF  has  been  submitted  for  the  drug  substance.  The  drug  substance  synthesis  is  described  in 
three steps. Entacapone from the last step is then purified to give the desired crystalline form. Detailed 
information  regarding  the  control  of  starting  materials,  reagents  and  raw  materials  as  well  as  the 
control of critical steps and intermediates is provided in the ASMF.  
Satisfactory  information  on  the  validation  production  batches  and  on  the  manufacturing  process 
development is also provided. 
Specification 
Entacapone was not described in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur) at the time of submission. The 
specification  of  the  active  substance  as  set  up  by  the  drug  product  manufacturer  includes  tests  and 
limits  for  description  (visual),  identification  (IR,  XRPD),  loss  on  drying,  residue  on  ignition,  heavy 
metals,  assay  (potentiometry),  related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  particle  size 
distribution  (laser  light  diffraction),  bulk  and  tapped  density  (Ph.Eur.)  and  microbiological  quality 
(Ph.Eur.). 
Batch analysis data is presented for five batches. All data comply with the specifications. 
Stability 
Three  validation  batches  have  been  subjected  to  stability  studies  under  accelerated,  long  term  and 
intermediate  conditions.  Results  for  24  months  long-term  and  for  six  months  accelerated  have  been 
presented for the three batches as per ICH guidelines and no abnormality observed in either condition. 
Twelve months results from the intermediate stability study have been submitted for the three batches 
as  per  ICH  guidelines  and  no  abnormality  observed.  All  data  meet  the  specification  limits  (also  the 
tighter) in all three storage conditions and at all time points. No trends were observed. 
Based on the forced degradation studies, only one degradation impurity formed or increased. However 
the  extent  of  the  formation  /  increase  was  found  to  be  very  marginal  for  the  physical  degradation 
conditions, which simulates the stability of the product. Hence, no concern with regard to the stability 
of the product over a long period is expected. 
A photo stability study has been conducted on entacapone and it was found that no change in impurity 
profile was observed due to UV and fluorescent light. 
In  view  of  all  the  information  presented,  the  proposed  retest  period  and  storage  conditions  are 
considered acceptable. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 1 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA.

The aim of the development work was to formulate immediate-release tablets containing qualitatively 
and  quantitatively  the  same  active  substance  as  the  original  product  Comtess  200  mg  film-coated 
tablets and exhibiting the same bioavailability. 
The  excipients  selected  are  all  standard  and  commonly  used  in  the  pharmaceutical  industry.  Most  of 
them are also present in the formulation of the innovator product. Therefore they are expected to be 
compatible. 
Because  entacapone  is  practically  insoluble  in  water  and  especially  in  low  pH  and  highly  soluble  in 
higher  pH  it  can  be  considered  as  a  drug  with  low  solubility  according  to  the  Biopharmaceutical 
Classification System, BCS. The permeability of the drug is also low; therefore, entacapone belongs to 
BCS class 4.  
Dissolution  profiles  of  Entacapone  Teva  200  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  the  reference  product 
Comtess 200 mg film-coated tablets were tested in water an in a range of pH and buffered media. In 
the chosen dissolution medium sink condition was fulfilled. In this medium a very fast dissolution rate 
was  achieved  for  all  products  tested.  Therefore  it  can  be  concluded  that  dissolution  is  not  a  rate-
limiting step. 
Comparative  dissolution  profiles  were  presented  between  the  test  product  and  the  reference  product 
used in the bioequivalence study. 
During  the  first  set  of  experiments,  different  manufacturing  processes  were  compared,  and  different 
excipients  were  added  in  order  to  find  a  suitable  matrix  for  compression  and  dissolution.  Preliminary 
stability studies were run with some of these batches and the results were favourable.  
The  final  formulation  was  optimised  in  order  to  ensure  robustness  and  reproducibility  of  the 
manufacture. 
Based  on  this  development  work  two  pilot  batches  were  manufactured  for  the  biostudy  and  stability 
studies. 
The tablets are packaged in HDPE tablet containers with screw caps of polypropylene (PP). The screw 
caps are stated to be tamper-evident and have a desiccant insert.  
Adventitious agents 
None  of  the  excipients  are  of  human  or  animal  origin.  Appropriate  TSE/BSE  free  declarations  were 
provided. 
Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  process  divided  into  six  main  steps.  The  critical  steps  have 
been  identified  and  appropriate  in-process  controls  have  been  set  up.  The  holding  times  are  defined. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  described  and  validated.  The  manufacturing  process 
will  be  validated  according  to  a  process  validation  protocol  on  three  consecutive  production  batches. 
The protocol has been presented and is found acceptable.  
Product Specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  includes  tests  and  limits  for  description 
(visually),  identification  of  drug  substance  (UPLC,  UV),  identification  of  coating  colorants  (colour 
EMA/52316/2011

reaction), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), related substances (UPLC), dissolution (UPLC, Ph.Eur.), 
assay (UPLC), and microbiological quality (Ph.Eur.- non routinely). 
Batch  analysis  data  is  presented  for  two  commercial  scale  batches.  All  data  presented  complies  with 
the specification and indicate that the process is under control, confirming consistency and uniformity 
of manufacture. 
Stability of the Product 
Long-term (25 ± 2 °C / 60 ± 5% RH) stability data for two pilot batches covering up 16 months were 
provided.  Stability  data  for  two  pilot  batches  covering  six  months  at  accelerated  conditions  (40  °C  ± 
2 °C / 75% RH ± 5% RH) were also provided. 
All results were found within the specification limits at all time points up to 16 months in long term and 
six  months  in  accelerated  storage  conditions.  No  trends  were  observed  for  any  of  the  tested 
parameters.  
In-use stability 
Stability data is also presented for an in-use stability study where one batch was studied for 6 months. 
Appearance  and  dissolution  did  not  change.  Assay  and  degradation  products  did  not  change 
significantly and remained within specification limits. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  presented  the  proposed  shelf  life  and  storage  conditions  can  be  accepted 
for Entacapone Teva. 
In general, the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines 2 ,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.4 Discussion and Conclusions on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and 
drug  product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
satisfactory  consistency  and  uniformity  of important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn 
lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the 
clinic. 
2.3  Non-Clinical aspects 
No further studies are required and the applicant has justified why no such data was provided. 
The non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is based on literature 
searches  and  adequate  scientific  literature  has  been  provided.  The  overview  justifies  why  there  is  no 
need to generate new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. There is thus 
no need for conducting tests on animals. 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. The introduction of Entacapone Teva manufactured 
by Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Limited Company is unlikely to result in any significant increase 
in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all  entacapone  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

2.4  Clinical Aspects  
2.4.1 Introduction 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted a single bioequivalence study P1EB09005. 
For  the  clinical  assessment  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioavailability  and 
Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EPW/QWP/1401/98)  in  its  current  version  as  well  as  the  Questions  &  Answers 
on  the  Bioavailability  and  Bioequivalence  Guidelines  (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/40326/2006)  are  of  particular 
relevance. 
GCP 
The bioequivalence study was performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
One  inspection  of  the  site  has  been  performed  by  the  Canadian  Authority  (Health  Canada,  Health 
Products and Food Program-Inspectorate on July 10, 2008) and five times by the FDA. 
2.4.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
The bioequivalence study P1EB09005 was an open-label two dose study of test and reference product 
in a four-way cross-over replicate fasting state design.  Either a single 200 mg dose of Entacapone or a 
single  200  mg  dose  of  Comtess  was  administered  to  each  subject  with  240  ml  of  water  following  an 
overnight  fast  of  at  least  10  hours.  The  analytical  personnel  were  blinded  from  the  treatment 
sequence.  
Blood sampling was performed pre-dose and then at 0.167, 0.33, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 hours. The washout between each of the four periods lasted for at least 7 
days. The analysis was performed on the E-isomer (two stereoisomers exist) of entacapone in plasma, 
that  stands  for  the  majority  of  the  AUC  (95%).  The  stereoisomers  are  equally  active  but  due  to  the 
difference in exposure, the E-isomer is the important one.  
The final protocol was approved by the IRB on July 3rd, 2009 (Optimum Clinical Research Inc). A GCP 
statement was included.  
The study was performed in Canada. The bioanalysis took place in Canada.

Expiration date: 10/2010 
Population studied   
Thirty-four (Group 1) and seventy-seven (Group 2) volunteers were screened for this study. 
For  Group  1,  thirteen  (13)  subjects  did  not  participate  for  the  following  reasons:  3  standbys  and  1 
overnight  standby  were  not  used.  1  subject  was  excluded  at  Period  1  check-in  due  to  positive  drug 
test.  3  subjects  were  not  available  for  the  study.  5  subjects  were  withdrawn,  because  the  subjects 
were no longer required for study as study was full. 
Five (5) subjects were deemed ineligible after the medical screening for the following reasons: Recent 
blood donation (1 subject), Out-of-Specification BMI (1 subject), Out-of-Specification vitals (1 subject), 
Positive Cotinine (1 subject) and Failed labs (1 subject). 16 subjects were then remaining.  
For Group 2, eighteen (18) subjects did not participate for the following reasons: 1 overnight standby 
was  not  used.  5  subjects  were  excluded  at  Period  1  check-in  due  to  Out-of-Specification  vitals.  1 
subject was excluded prior to dosing due to Change in Health. 11 subjects were not available for the 
study. 
Fifteen  (15)  subjects  were  deemed  ineligible  after  the  medical  screening  for  the  following  reasons: 
Poor veins (4 subject), Out-of-Specification vitals (3 subject), Positive Cotinine (2 subject) and Failed 
labs (6 subject). 44 subjects were then remaining. Subjects who completed at least two periods were 
included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis.  
In  total,  sixty  (36  males  and  24  females)  healthy  non-smoking  subjects  aged  19-54  years  were 
enrolled. Their races were either of Indian, Asian, Black or White origin.  
Protocol Deviations 
During the 12 hour post dose vital signs at Period 3 check-out, the vital signs for some subjects were 
measured  one  minute  earlier  than  the  12  hour  +/-  1  hour  window  allows.  This  occurred  for  subjects 
29,  35  and  37.  During  period  4,  the  12  hour  post  dose  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  for  Subject  54 
was  performed,  however,  not  documented  on  source  in  error  resulting  in  no  values  for  these 
parameters.  This  subject  had  no  ongoing  Adverse  Events  at  this  time  and  was  seen  by  the  sub-
investigator prior to leaving the clinic at the end of the confinement period. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  computed  from  the  plasma  concentration  data  using  the  actual 
sample collection times. These deviations did not have an impact on the results. 
Analytical methods 
The analyses to determine the human plasma concentrations of entacapone in the study samples was 
conducted in Canada. Plasma concentrations of entacapone (E-isomer) were determined with a High 
EMA/52316/2011  
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.  The 
analytical method was validated. 
Satisfactory  method  performance  during  study  sample  analysis  was  demonstrated.  Appropriate  batch 
acceptance  criteria  were used.  Repeated  analysis was  adequately justified. Twenty-one  samples  were 
repeated.  Long-term  stability  for  a  period  covering  the  time  from  first  sample  collection  until  last 
sample analysis was demonstrated. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered that the performance of the analytical methods was satisfactory. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  calculated/observed  were  AUC0-t,  AUC0- ∞ ,  Cmax,  AUC0-t/AUC0- ∞ , 
Tmax, Kel and T1/2 by using standard non-compartmental methods.  The primary variables were AUC0-
t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax. The pharmacokinetic variables were considered to be adequate. 
Statistical methods   
Analysis  of  Variance  (ANOVA)  was  performed  on  each  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  using  SAS 
software.  The  ANOVA  model  containing  factors  for  sequence  of  products,  subjects  within  sequence, 
group,  period  and  products  was  utilized  in  comparing  the  effects  between  the  test  and  reference 
products.  
A  90%  confidence  interval  (CI)  about  the  ratio  of  the  mean  test  value  to  mean  reference  value  was 
calculated  for  all  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  The  calculations  for  power  and  the  CI  used  the 
least  squares  means  and  the  standard  error  of  the  estimate,  each  generated  with  SAS  software.  The 
ratio  of  the  geometric  means  for  the  ln-transformed  data  and  the  corresponding  90%  CIs  were 
calculated for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax.  According to the protocol, bioequivalence (BE) is concluded 
when the ratios of geometric means and their corresponding 90 % CIs are within 80-125 % for AUC0-t 
and within 75-133 % for Cmax. If the intra-subject variability of the reference product for Cmax is less 
than 30 %, then the geometric mean ratios and their 90 % confidence intervals need to be within 80-
125 % for Cmax. Tmax was analysed by using a non-parametric analysis.  
Subjects were to be divided into two groups: Group 1 (Subject Nos. 1-16) and Group 2 (Subject Nos. 
17–60)  for  dosing.  Group  1  were  to  be  dosed  first  and  an  interim  assay  and  analysis  were  to  be 
performed on data obtained from Group 1 for information purposes. If there were safety concerns, or if 
the two products were to be clearly not bioequivalent (i.e. the ratios are not indicative of BE), Group 2 
was not to be dosed. Otherwise, a complete analysis of data obtained from Group 1 and Group 2 was 
to  be  performed,  irrespective  of  the  interim  analysis  results  from  Group  1.  This  was  to  be  done  to 
maintain the fixed type-I error rate at 5%. The study was not to be pre-maturely stopped if the results 
obtained from Group 1 meet BE. A treatment by group interaction test was performed to know if data 
from group 1 and 2 could be combined. Since no statistically significant treatment effect was observed, 
the data from both groups was pooled. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  statistical  approach  to  be  acceptable  since  the  evaluation  was  not  stopped 
after  group  1  based  on  a  positive  outcome  (i.e.  showing  bioequivalence).  This  is  acceptable  from  a 
statistical standpoint (bioequivalence was shown after the first interim analysis). 
Results 
Following  the  Group  1  interim  analyses,  for  entacapone  E-isomer,  the  test/reference  ratios  of 
geometric means were 102.69% (90% CI 96.70% - 109.05%) for AUC0-t, 104.53% (90% CI 98.97% - 
110.40%) for AUC0-inf, and 103.51% (90% CI 86.14% - 124.38%) for Cmax. 
Additionally, there  were  no  safety  concerns  observed  during  Group  1  and  therefore  it  was  decided  to 
continue  the  study  and  dose  Group  2.  The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  for  group  1  and  2  combined 
are presented in Table 1.

No sequence or period effects were observed for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ or Cmax. The extrapolated area in all 
subjects was below 20 %. No pre-dose levels were detected.  The 90 % confidence intervals for each 
primary parameter fall within the normal acceptance limits of 80-125 % and therefore bioequivalence 
with the reference product has been established. 
Safety data 
22 subjects experienced a total of 42 adverse events (AEs) over the course of the study. AEs were mild 
to moderate in intensity. Overall, the most common AEs reported were tachycardia, nausea, dizziness, 
headache,  blood  pressure  increased  and  heart  rate  increased.  The  frequency  of  AEs  was  similar  for 
both  treatments.  No  subject  discontinued  due  to  an  AE.  No  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  were 
reported over the course of this study. 
The  clinical  portion  of  the  study  was  completed  without  any  significant  sequelae  attributable  to  the 
investigational  drug.  Overall,  entacapone  tablets  were  well  tolerated  as  a  single  oral  dose  of  200  mg 
(1 × 200 mg) administered to healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions. 
Conclusions 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study,  Entacapone  Teva  200  mg  film-coated  tablet  is 
considered bioequivalent with Comtess 200 mg film-coated tablet. 
2.4.3 Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  presented  and  no  such  studies  are  required  for  this 
application. 
2.4.4 Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country.

2.4.5 Discussion on Clinical aspects 
The  CHMP  assessment  addressed  pharmacokinetic  data  for  a  single  bioequivalence  study  (study 
P1EB09005). The study design is considered adequate with regard to wash-out period, sampling period 
and  sampling  scheme  according  to  expected  Tmax  and  T1/2.    The  CHMP  considered  it  acceptable  to 
demonstrate bioequivalence for the active E-isomer alone. The study was conducted in line with GCP. 
The  results  of  the  bio-equivalence  study  show  that  the  90  %  confidence  intervals  for  each  primary 
parameter fall within the normal acceptance limits of 80-125 % and therefore bioequivalence with the 
reference product has been established. 
2.4.6 Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study,  Entacapone  Teva  200  mg  film-coated  tablet  is 
considered bioequivalent with Comtess 200 mg film-coated tablet. 
2.5  Pharmacovigilance  
PSUR 
The PSUR submission schedule for Entacapone film-coated tablets should follow the PSUR schedule for 
the reference product. 
The data lock point for the reference medicinal product is 16 January 2011. 
Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.   
The  MAH  must  ensure  that  the  system  of  pharmacovigilance,  as  presented  in  Module  1.8.1.  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before and whilst the product is on the 
market. 
Risk Management Plan 
The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring 
additional risk minimization activities have been identified. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities according to volume 9A/ICH will be undertaken whilst the product 
is  in  the  market,  including  careful  review  of  individual  case  safety  reports,  literature  review,  signal 
detection procedures and generation of the required safety reports. Specific risk minimisation activities 
are  not  envisaged  as  the  safety  aspects  of  the  product  are  well  characterised  and  therefore  a  Risk 
Minimisation plan is not required. 
2.6  User consultation 
The  user  testing  of  the  package  leaflet  was  performed.  The  criterion  for  a  successful  Readability  Test 
was fulfilled. The user testing of the package leaflet was judged acceptable.

2.7  Benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
The application contains adequate quality and clinical data and the bioequivalence has been shown for 
the 200 mg film-coated tablet. A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore 
be concluded.  
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen 
reference  medicinal  product,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio  of  Entacapone  Teva  as  an  adjunct  to  standard  preparations  of  levodopa/benserazide  or 
levodopa/carbidopa  for  use  in  adult  patients  with  Parkinson’s  disease  and  end-of-dose  motor 
fluctuations,  who  cannot  be  stabilised  on  those  combinations,  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
COMETRIQ (CABOZANTINIB) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Cometriq.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Cometriq, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will 
be obtained about Cometriq's risks. 
Cometriq's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Cometriq should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Cometriq should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Cometriq's RMP. 
The Medicine and What it is Used for 
I 
Cometriq  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  progressive,  unresectable 
locally advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (see SmPC for the full indication). 
It contains cabozantinib as the active substance and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Cometriq’s benefits can be found in Cometriq’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicine’s 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/cometriq  
II   Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or 
Further Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of Cometriq, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Cometriq's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and  regularly  analysed  including  periodic  safety  update  report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that 
immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Cometriq are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there 
is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Cometriq. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data  but  this 
 
 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently  missing  and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk – Gastrointestinal perforation 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of gastrointestinal perforation was initially identified based on 
cabozantinib clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 and 
XL184-301). Gastrointestinal perforation is a rare but serious AE and is 
thought to occur in approximately 3% of cabozantinib-treated patients, 
consistent with the data generated during the MTC clinical 
development programme. Vandetanib also carries a warning for GI 
perforation although the reported incidence is lower than that of 
cabozantinib at 0.4%. Spontaneous gastric perforation has been 
reported in patients treated with axitinib (1%), pazopanib (1%) and 
sorafenib (1%). Sunitinib also carries a warning for GI perforation 
based on clinical trial data. Gastrointestinal perforation can have 
debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes and therefore is an important 
identified risk for cabozantinib. 
Patients who have MTC, inflammatory bowel disease (for example, 
Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, carcinomatosis, peritonitis or 
diverticulitis), have tumour infiltration of the GI viscera or have 
complications from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with 
delayed or incomplete healing) are potentially at higher risk of 
developing perforation. Individuals with familial MTC may develop GI 
perforation regardless of whether or not they are taking cabozantinib. 
Additional risk factors include concurrent use of steroid treatment or 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Important identified risk - Gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal fistula 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal fistula was initially 
identified based on cabozantinib clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, 
XL184-201 and XL184-301). Gastrointestinal fistula formation in 
patients with MTC is an uncommon AE reported for cabozantinib, as 
well as other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as pazopanib and 
lenvatinib used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Non-GI fistula has 
been reported in patients with thyroid cancer treated with 
anti-angiogenic TKIs such as sorafenib and sunitinib. Fistula can have 
a debilitating, disabling or fatal outcome and therefore is an important 
identified risk for cabozantinib. 
GI fistula:  
Risk factors for GI fistula are the same as for GI perforations noted 
above. In addition, RET mutations, MEN 2A or MEN 2B disease and 
radiation therapy may predispose to fistula formation; complications 
from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or 
incomplete healing) are potentially at higher risk of developing 
fistulae. 
Non-GI fistula:  
Risk factors for these events include infiltration of viscera by tumour 
(including bronchus and trachea), active complications affecting the 
viscera from prior radiotherapy and incomplete healing after surgery.

Important identified risk – Thromboembolic events 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of thromboembolic events was initially identified based on 
cabozantinib clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 and 
XL184-301). In a meta-analysis of 12 prospective clinical trials 
evaluating the role of TKI treatment in advanced thyroid cancer, the 
incidences of high-grade ATEs and VTEs associated with TKIs were 
1.4% and 3.3%, respectively (n=1781 subjects). An increased risk of 
thromboembolic events is shared by various TKIs used in the 
treatment of thyroid cancer such as lenvatinib, vandetanib and 
sorafenib, among others. Events as described can have debilitating, 
disabling or fatal outcomes and so thromboembolic events are an 
important identified risk of cabozantinib treatment. 
 
 
Important identified risk – Thromboembolic events 
Risk factors 
and risk 
groups 
Cancer patients are at high risk for VTE. Cancer growth is associated 
with the development of a prothrombotic state. Malignant cells can 
activate blood coagulation in several ways: by producing procoagulant, 
fibrinolytic and pro-aggregating activities; by releasing 
proinflammatory and proangiogenic cytokines; and by interacting 
directly with host vascular and blood cells, such as endothelial cells, 
leucocytes and platelets, by means of adhesion molecules. The 
pathogenesis of VTE in cancer patients appears to be multifactorial, 
with the most important clinical determinants for the risk of VTE 
including tumour stage at the time of diagnosis, tumour site, 
anticancer therapy and surgery. Presence of the Virchow’s triad 
predisposes an individual to the development of thrombosis: 
endothelial injury (damage to the vessel wall), stasis (slowing down of 
blood flow) and alterations in blood coagulability (inherited or 
acquired). Most patients with VTE have one or more risk factors. 
Patients with a history of VTE are more likely to experience additional 
episodes, particularly if they are exposed to high-risk situations. 
There are considerably more data on venous thrombosis than for 
arterial thrombosis in cancer. Increased levels of coagulation 
molecules, concurrent disease (such as endocarditis), use of growth 
factors and cytotoxic chemotherapy may increase the risk of arterial 
thrombosis.

Important identified risk – Haemorrhage (Grade ≥3) 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of severe haemorrhage (Grade ≥3) was initially identified 
based on cabozantinib clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 
and XL184-301), which is consistent with rates in the published 
literature of up to 3%. A number of serious and fatal cases of 
haemorrhage following VEGF-targeting TKIs, including cabozantinib, 
vandetanib and lenvatinib, for thyroid cancer have been reported. 
Moreover, Grade ≥3 haemorrhages are seen in 2% to 3% of patients 
with thyroid cancer treated with the TKIs sorafenib, sunitinib and 
pazopanib, suggesting that the risk of haemorrhage is an overall risk 
of this class of drugs. In a meta-analysis of 23 trials, of which four 
randomised studies were available to analyse data pertaining to 
bleeding events, the relative risk of bleeding events in cancer patients 
treated with sorafenib or sunitinib was significantly higher compared to 
placebo. Haemorrhage may require urgent medical support to prevent 
loss of life and, therefore, it is an important identified risk of 
cabozantinib treatment. 
 
Important identified risk – Haemorrhage (Grade ≥3) 
Risk factors 
and risk 
groups 
Tissues with tumour involvement may potentially be associated with 
more frequent haemorrhage than uninvolved areas, especially if there 
is encroachment of blood vessels. The potential patient factors that 
could be associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract 
haemorrhage include patients with evidence of tumour infiltration of 
the trachea or bronchi or a history of haemoptysis prior to treatment. 
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage could be induced by comedication with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or corticosteroids. 
Treatment of thrombotic events with anticoagulation can also 
predispose to haemorrhage.

Important identified risk – Wound complications 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of wound complications was initially identified based on data 
from cabozantinib clinical studies where it was experienced by 9/295 
cabozantinib-treated subjects in Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 and 
XL184-301, which is consistent with data from other TKIs such as 
axitinib (2%). According to drug labels, impaired wound healing is a 
potential risk following treatment with TKIs such as pazopanib, 
sorafenib, sunitinib and vandetanib, although no formal studies have 
been conducted to determine the frequency of wound complications in 
these populations. These events can have debilitating, disabling or 
fatal outcomes, and wound complications is therefore an important 
identified risk for cabozantinib. 
Patients with wounds from accidents or surgery. Significant risk factors 
include age over 65 years, wound infection, malignancy, obesity, 
pulmonary disease, haemodynamic instability, ascites, uraemia, 
diabetes, and hypertension.

Important identified risk – Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy syndrome 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
PRES was initially identified as an important identified risk of 
cabozantinib based on clinical trial data (Studies XL184-001, 
XL184-201 and XL184-301). Although the overall incidence of PRES is 
low, there have been several case reports of patients developing this 
syndrome after treatment with TKIs, including pazopanib, sunitinib, 
sorafenib and bevacizumab. Although PRES is an infrequent syndrome, 
these events can have debilitating, disabling or fatal outcomes so PRES 
is therefore an important identified risk of cabozantinib treatment. 
Risk factors for PRES in general include hypertensive disorders, renal 
failure and immunosuppressive therapies. Due to the identified 
comorbidities of hypertension and phaeochromocytoma among 
patients with MTC, the population may be at higher risk.

Important identified risk - Osteonecrosis 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of osteonecrosis was initially identified based on cabozantinib 
clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 and XL184-301). 
Osteonecrosis, particularly involving the jaw, is a potentially serious 
adverse side effect of cabozantinib. A literature review covering 35 
patients with medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw found that 
three patients had received sunitinib (8.57%), cabozantinib (two 
patients, 5.71%) or sorafenib (one patient, 2.86%). Medication-related 
ONJ may be exacerbated by patient risk factors such as dental 
extraction, mucosal trauma from dentures, chronic periodontal disease 
and insertion of osteointegrated dental implants. These events can 
have debilitating, disabling or disfigurement outcomes and 
osteonecrosis is therefore an important identified risk for cabozantinib. 
Concurrent treatment with other agents that have been associated 
with ONJ such as bisphosphonates, prior radiation therapy involving 
the jaw, prior therapy with other inhibitors of VEGF pathways and 
invasive dental procedures are possible risk factors. Additional risk 
factors have been identified such as use of corticosteroids, 
chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, poor oral hygiene, smoking and 
dental or orofacial surgery procedures.

Important potential risk – Renal failure 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
Renal failure has initially been identified as a potential risk of 
cabozantinib based on clinical data (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 
and XL184-301). There are isolated reports of cabozantinib-induced 
renal thrombotic microangiopathy as well as minimal change nephrotic 
syndrome or focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis. Review of the 
package inserts for other TKI medications used in the treatment of 
MTC and thyroid cancer showed <1% of subjects receiving sorafenib 
developed renal failure, compared to 3% of placebo-treated subjects. 
No incidence of renal failure was reported for sunitinib or pazopanib. 
Although vandetanib has been associated with increased urinary 
albumin extraction and loss of glomerular endothelial cell integrity in 
mice and rats, there have been no such reports in humans. 
Renal failure in the MTC studies was reported concomitantly or shortly 
after other precipitating events such as dehydration secondary to 
vomiting and diarrhoea. Renal failure can be secondary to contrast 
agent toxicity, hypertension, urinary tract infection, and diabetes 
mellitus.

Important potential risk - Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of hepatotoxicity was initially identified based on cabozantinib 
clinical studies (Studies XL184-001, XL184-201 and XL184-301). A 
recently published comprehensive literature review on hepatotoxicity 
and TKI treatments, including cabozantinib, concluded that there is an 
increased risk of drug induced liver injury associated with this class of 
drugs with no findings for cabozantinib. Across clinical trials of TKIs, 
this review reported an overall incidence of high grade ALT/AST 
elevations (Grade 3 or higher) that ranged from 0 to 14% of patients. 
However, as such events can have debilitating, disabling or fatal 
outcomes, hepatotoxicity is considered an important potential risk for 
cabozantinib. 
A comprehensive meta-analysis of 12 published placebo-controlled 
phase II and III trials found a significant overall increase in the odds of 
developing high-grade (Grade 3 or above) hepatotoxicity with the use 
of TKIs compared to the control arms. This finding was confirmed by 
Ghatalia et al  who demonstrated an increased relative risk of all grade 
ALT, AST and total bilirubin in patients exposed to VEGFR-TKIs 
compared to nonexposed controls. There is at present no evidence to 
suggest that hepatotoxicity is an on-target effect linked to TKI efficacy 
and therefore its appearance calls for adjustment of therapy when it is 
severe enough.

Important potential risk -Embryotoxicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of embryotoxicity was initially identified based on nonclinical 
data. There was one partner pregnancy reported in Study XL184-301, 
with no reported AEs. Serial ultrasound examinations at Weeks 16, 23, 
and 36 revealed adequate foetal growth and no foetal structural 
malformations. There was a follow-up report on the continued 
monitoring of the infant up to 6 months of age; at approximately 5 
months of age the baby was assessed as healthy. No cases of 
pregnancy or pregnancy in partner have been described for 
cabozantinib during postmarketing experience through to the DLP of 
28 November 2018. In definitive reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies, XL184 was embryotoxic and produced foetal 
malformations in rats and foetal soft-tissue malformations, but no 
foetal external or skeletal malformations, in rabbits. In a review of the 
literature on pregnancy and cancer, Doll et al reported that the 
incidence of foetal malformations with first trimester chemotherapy 
exposure with a variety of agents ranged from 14% to 19%. Exposure 
in the second and third trimester was associated with an incidence of 
foetal malformations of 1.3%. Similar findings were reported in a 
review of 376 foetuses exposed to chemotherapy in utero, the majority 
of which were exposed after organogenesis. Nine of the 11 reported 
malformations occurred in patients receiving chemotherapy in the first 
trimester. 
The ‘at risk’ group for experiencing cabozantinib related embryotoxicity 
comprises female patients of childbearing potential or female partners 
of male patients treated with cabozantinib. 
Risk factor in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: 
Treatment with chemotherapy in the first trimester, during 
organogenesis, substantially increases the risk of foetal malformation 
compared to exposure to chemotherapy in the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy.

Important potential risk – Carcinogenicity 
Evidence for 
linking the 
risk to the 
medicine 
The potential risk of carcinogenicity was identified based on nonclinical 
data. Administration of cabozantinib in rats daily at doses of 0.1, 0.3 
and 1 mg/kg for up to 104 weeks resulted in benign 
phaeochromocytoma, alone or in combination with malignant 
phaeochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in males administered 
≥0.1 mg/kg/day and females administered ≥0.3 mg/kg/day, together 
with hyperplasia of the adrenal medulla in females administered ≥0.1 
mg/kg/day (Study XL184-NC-036). No clinical cases of 
phaeochromocytoma have occurred through the DLP of 
28 November 2020. However, as any type of carcinoma can have 
debilitating, disabling or fatal outcome, carcinogenicity is considered 
an important potential risk for cabozantinib. 
Prior anticancer therapies and radiation may contribute to the risk in a 
particular patient. The risk of developing carcinoma is likely to be 
multifactorial in origin. Immune deficiency has been linked to 
increased risk of second cancers. Factors thought to play a role are 
age at diagnosis, prior anticancer therapies, radiation, environmental 
or lifestyle exposures and genetic susceptibility. In humans, both MEN 
2A and MEN 2B predispose patients to phaeochromocytoma.

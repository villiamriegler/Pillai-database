1.  Introduction 
On 28 February 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for HyQvia, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study 161503 “Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic 
Evaluation of HYQVIA in Pediatric Subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases”, is part of a 
clinical development programme. The programme to date includes 11 completed interventional studies 
(160601,160602, 160603, 160902, 161101, 170901, 161001, 161504, TAK-771-1001, 161403 and 
161503), 1 completed non-interventional pregnancy registry study (161301), 2 completed non-
interventional post-authorization safety studies on long-term safety in PIDD (161302, 161406) and 3 
ongoing studies (161505, TAK-771-3002 and TAK-771-3004). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 is a dual vial unit consisting of one vial of a liquid solution containing 100 
mg/mL protein of which at least 98% is IgG and one vial of a liquid solution containing 160 U/mL 
rHuPH20. The rHuPH20 was administered at a dose ratio of approximately 80 U/g IgG before the 
infusion of IGI, 10%. Infusion rates in Study 161503 were based on body weight (BW): up to 600 mL 
per infusion site for subjects with a BW ≥40 kg, and up to 300 mL per site for subjects with a BW <40 
kg.  
HYQVIA is an immune globulin infusion (IGI) 10% (human) with recombinant human hyaluronidase. 
The recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) component of HYQVIA increases dispersion 
and absorption of the IGI 10%. There is no pediatric formulation for HyQvia. The dose is calculated 
based on patient weight and the clinical response. There is no dose adjustment for the pediatric 
population.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final study report for: 
161503: “Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of 
• 
HYQVIA in Pediatric Subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases” 
The purpose of the current study was to acquire additional data on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic (PK), and other parameters of HYQVIA in pediatric subjects (age ≥2 
to < 16 years) with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD).

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
161503: “Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and 
Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of HYQVIA in Pediatric Subjects with Primary 
Immunodeficiency Diseases” 
Description 
Study 161503 was a Phase 3, open-label, prospective, non-controlled, multicenter study conducted in 
17 study centers in the US. The study consisted of 2 treatment periods (Epoch 1 and Epoch 2) and a 1-
year safety follow up (Epoch 3), if needed. Epoch 3 was planned for subjects who developed an anti-
rHuPH20 antibody titer of ≥160 during Epoch 1 or Epoch 2 and experienced either a study drug-related 
serious adverse event (SAE) or a related severe AE and were to be followed up for approximately 1 
year. No subject met these criteria and Epoch 3 was not initiated. 
In Epoch 1, subjects were treated with HYQVIA SC with a dose or interval ramp-up period of up to 6 
weeks, with all infusions administered at the study site. In Epoch 2, HYQVIA treatment was 
administered at the following intervals: 
• For IV-pretreated subjects - every 3 or 4 weeks, depending on the subject’s previous IV dosing 
schedule. 
• For SC-pretreated subjects - every 3 or 4 weeks, at the discretion of investigator and subject. 
After 1 year in Epoch 2, the anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody assay results during that year were used to 
decide the next steps in the study: 
• Subjects with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer < 160 at all time-points during the study 
completed the study completion visit at the next possible occasion following the 12-month 
visit. 
• Subjects with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥ 160 during the study and/or at the last 
measurement continued in Epoch 2 for an additional 2 years of HYQVIA treatment and 
observation and completed the study completion visit at the next possible occasion following 
the 36-month visit. 
In Epoch 2, after well tolerating the first 2-3 infusions of HYQVIA at the full dose for the final infusion 
interval (3- or 4-week dose) administered at the study site, subsequent infusions were administered 
either at home (or an equivalent site) by the subject/caregiver, or at the study site. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Study subjects were between 2 and < 16 years of age at screening, had a documented diagnosis of 
PIDD, and had received IV or non HYQVIA SC immunoglobulin therapy prior to study enrollment. 
Each subject was required to meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study: 
1. Documented diagnosis of a form of primary immunodeficiency involving a defect in antibody 
formation and requiring gammaglobulin replacement as defined according to the International Union of 
Immunological Societies (IUIS) Scientific Committee 2015 (Picard et al., 2015) prior to enrollment. The 
diagnosis had to be confirmed by the Sponsor´s Medical Director prior to first treatment with IP in the 
study.  
2. Between 2 and < 16 years of age at the time of screening. 
3. Been receiving a consistent dose of immunoglobulin G (IgG), administered in compliance with the 
respective product information for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening. The average

received prior intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) immunoglobulin therapy before enrollment into 
the study. 
Secondary Objective 
Further efficacy and safety assessments (eg, immunogenicity), tolerability, characteristics of product 
administration, treatment preference and satisfaction, health-related quality of life, and

subject-year in the intent-to-treat population (ie, Full Analysis Set [FAS]). Acute serious bacterial 
infections include bacteremia/sepsis, bacterial meningitis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial 
pneumonia, and visceral abscess, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Acute Serious 
Bacterial Infections, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry to Support 
Marketing of Human Immune Globulin Intravenous as Replacement Therapy for Primary Humoral 
Immunodeficiency (Food and Drug Administration, 2008). 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
Efficacy: 
1. Number of all infections per subject-year. 
2. Trough levels of IgG and IgG subclasses for Study Epoch 2. 
3. Trough levels of specific antibodies to clinically relevant pathogens (Clostridium tetani toxoid, 
Haemophilus influenzae, and Hepatitis B Virus) for Study Epoch 2. 
Pharmacokinetics (Epoch 2): 
1. For the PK assessment in Epoch 2, the following PK parameters were determined for observed total 
IgG levels: area under the curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F), maximum concentration (Cmax), 
minimum concentration (Cmin), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), and terminal half-life. 
Additionally, baselinecorrected total IgG AUC, Cmax and Tmax were calculated. 
Safety: 
1. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of SAEs, related and not related. 
2. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of all AEs, related and not related. 
3. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of local AEs, related and not related. 
4. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of systemic AEs, related and not related. 
5. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of all temporally associated AEs (starting during 
or within 72 hours of completion of infusion). 
6. Number and rate per infusion (excluding infections) of all causally related and/or temporally 
associated AEs. 
7. Rates of all AEs (excluding infections) defined as number of AEs categorized by MedDRA preferred 
terms, seriousness, and severity, divided by the number of infusions. 
8. Number/proportion of subjects who develop positive titer (≥160) of binding or neutralizing

Sample size 
The planned sample size for enrollment was approximately 40 subjects. A total of 44 subjects were 
enrolled in this study. A sample size of 35 provides 83% power to reject the null hypothesis (H0) of an 
ASBI rate greater or equal 1.0 (H0 ≥ 1.0), by means of a 1-sided test and a significance level of 0.01, 
versus the alternative hypothesis (H1) of less than 1.0 (H1< 1.0), assuming a true rate of 0.5/year. 
Based on previous clinical experience, a dropout rate of 12% was assumed. Allowing for 12% 
dropouts, approximately 40 subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical Methods 
Subjects were classified into the following analysis sets: Screened Set, Enrolled Set, FAS, Per-protocol 
Analysis Set (PPS), Safety Analysis Set, and Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set. The planned sample size for 
enrollment was approximately 40 subjects. A total of 44 subjects were enrolled in this study. A sample 
size of 35 provides 83% power to reject the null hypothesis (H0) of an ASBI rate greater than or equal 
to 1.0 (H0 ≥ 1.0), by means of a 1-sided test and a significance level of 0.01, versus the alternative 
hypothesis (H1) of less than 1.0 (H1< 1.0), assuming a true rate of 0.5/year. Based on previous 
clinical experience, a dropout rate of 12% was assumed. Allowing for 12% dropouts, approximately 40 
subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study. 
Subject disposition, and demographic and other baseline characteristics are summarized, as described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Disposition summaries and listings were based on all subjects, using 
the Screened set. Demographics and other baseline characteristics summaries were based on the FAS. 
A summary of the number and proportion of subjects in different population sets were provided. 
The primary endpoint/outcome measure was the rate of ASBIs which were reported as the mean 
number of ASBIs per subject-year. 
The number of infections were counted from the start of the initial dose of HYQVIA (start of Epoch 1) 
through the end of Epoch 2. HYQVIA was administered in Epoch 1 and Epoch 2, and GAMMAGARD 
LIQUID was to be received only in Epoch 3. 
The secondary endpoints/outcome for the final analysis was to measure the annual rate of infection 
under HYQVIA treatment and was computed using a Poisson model and presented as point estimate 
and 95% confidence interval (CI). Total IgG trough levels, IgG subclass trough levels, and trough 
levels of specific antibodies were summarized using descriptive statistics. Non-compartmental analysis 
was used to calculate observed total IgG PK parameters and select baseline-corrected parameters at 
the Epoch 2 Month 6 visit and beyond. 
The FDA Guidance for Industry on the evaluation of immunoglobulin IV replacement therapy for 
primary humoral immunodeficiency recommends the evaluation of efficacy by comparing the rate of 
serious infections over an observation period of at least 12 months to a fixed value of 1.0 (by showing 
that the upper one-sided 99% confidence limit is less than 1.0). An interim analysis was performed 
when all subjects had completed 12 months of study participation in Epoch 2; all but one subject had 
completed the study at this stage. The final analysis includes all subjects up to study completion and 
prior to database lock. This final CSR includes all efficacy, safety and other study outcome measures, 
and therefore represents all data of Study Protocol 161503, designed in alignment with the FDA 
Guidance for Industry. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 47 subjects were screened in the study; of these, 3 subjects (6.4%) were screen failures, 
and 44 subjects met eligibility criteria and were enrolled and dosed in the study. At the data-freeze 
date (16 Nov 2020), 34 subjects (77.3%) who were dosed had completed 12 months of the Epoch 2 
EMA/258995/2023

study. One subject from the 44 enrolled was followed for a further 24 months after meeting the criteria 
in Epoch 2. At database lock (01 Nov 2022) all subjects had completed the Epoch 2. No subjects met 
the criteria for Epoch 3. 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued the study before completing Epoch 2 was 10 subjects 
(22.7%). Of the 10 subjects that discontinued before EOS, 2 subjects completed all Epoch 2 
mandatory visits/assessments preceding EOS (see details below). The most frequent reason for 
premature subject discontinuation was withdrawal by subject, reported in 6 subjects (60%).  
Subject disposition Epoch 1. 
43 subjects (97.7%) completed Epoch 1. One subject (2.3%) discontinued the study during Epoch 1 
due to a TEAE of gastrointestinal disorder (coeliac disease) (Table 1). 
Subject disposition Epoch 2. 
34 subjects (77.3%) completed Epoch 2. Among the subjects who discontinued during Epoch 2 (9 
subjects [20.5%]), the most frequent reason for subjects’ discontinuation was withdrawal by the 
subject, 6 subjects (66.7%) (Table 2). One subject discontinued during Epoch 2 due to physician's 
decision and 1 subject withdrew due to a TEAE of general disorders and administration site condition 
(infusion site pain). One subject  was prematurely discontinued from the study due to COVID-19 
constraint at the site in conducting the final visit. The subject was unable to complete the final visit, 
prompting the physician to terminate the subject and put the subject on commercial product. This 
incident of premature discontinuation was reported as “other” reason in the study disposition table. 
One subject at the end of the first year of Epoch 2 had an anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer of ≥160; the 
subject began an extended follow-up of 2 years in Epoch 2. A total of 44 subjects were analyzed for 
efficacy and safety; and 40 subjects were analyzed for PK.

were reported in ≤30% of subjects. 
Measurements of Treatment Compliance 
Treatment performed at the study site or infusion center was under the direct supervision of the 
investigator/a licensed healthcare professional (eg, infusion nurse). Non-compliance was reported as a 
protocol deviation refer to Section 10.2. 
Number analysed 
The analysis population is summarized in Table 4 below. A total of 44 subjects were enrolled in the 
study and were included in the FAS, Safety Analysis Set, and PPS. A total of 40 subjects (90.9%) were 
included in the PK analysis set. Demographic and baseline characteristics were analyzed using the FAS. 
Efficacy results were analyzed using the FAS except for a sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint 
which used the PPS. All safety analyzes were performed using the Safety Analysis Set. 
Table 4 Analysis Population – All subjects 
All subjects except 1 continued in Epoch 2 after completing Epoch 1. One subject discontinued the 
study during Epoch 1 due to an AE. Thirty-four subjects completed Epoch 2 of the study whereas only 
1 subject had additional per-protocol follow-up in Epoch 2 for 2 years. No subject entered Epoch 3.  
Among the subjects who discontinued during Epoch 2 (9 subjects), the most frequent reason for 
subject discontinuation was withdrawal by the subject.

Outcomes 
The primary efficacy outcome assessed in Study 161503 was the annual rate of acute serious bacterial 
infections (ASBIs) per subject defined as the mean number of ASBIs per subject per year. Secondary 
efficacy endpoints included the annual rate of infection under HYQVIA treatment, and trough levels of 
IgG, IgG subclasses, and of specific antibodies. Additional efficacy assessments included health-related 
quality of life assessments using questionnaires filled out by parents or guardians for subjects aged < 
13 years such as the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds-QL) and the EuroQol five dimensions 
(EQ-5D-Y). Treatment preference and satisfaction was assessed using the Treatment Satisfaction and 
Medication Questionnaire (TSQM-9) and the Life Quality Index (LQI). Healthcare resource utilization 
pertaining to antibiotic use was also assessed. 
PK assessments of total IgG levels were performed in Epoch 2: area under the curve (AUC), clearance 
(CL), maximum concentration (Cmax), minimum concentration (Cmin), time to maximum 
concentration (Tmax), and terminal half-life (t½). Baseline corrected total IgG AUC, Cmax and Tmax 
were also calculated. 
Annual Rate of Acute Serious Bacterial Infections 
The mean rate of ASBIs per subject-year was 0.04, with an upper limit of the 99% CI of 0.20. The 
mean rate of ASBIs per year was statistically significantly lower than threshold rate of 1.0 ASBI per 
subject-year (at the 1% level adjusted for the final analysis; p<0.001). The mean (standard error 
[SE]) rate of all infections per subject-year 3.12 (0.450) with an upper limit of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of 3.95. The mean rate of all infections per subject-year was highest for the youngest age 
group and decreased with increasing age (4.01, 3.23, and 1.97 in the 2 to < 6, 6 to < 12, and 12 to < 
16 years age group, respectively). 
Trough Levels of IgG and IgG Subclasses 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in serum trough IgG levels between age groups during 
Epoch 2, with the highest median change from the Month 0 baseline measurement of <1.3 g/L. A 
similar trend was observed for IgG subclass results with stable levels across Epoch 2 and no notable 
age group differences for the first 12 months across Epoch 2. 
Trough Levels of Specific Antibodies 
Trough levels of specific antibodies against Clostridium tetani toxoid, Haemophilus influenzae, and 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) showed no substantial difference from the baseline values and were at levels 
more than 10 times above that considered to be the minimal protective titer. 
Pharmacokinetics 
There were no notable differences across age groups with respect to the PK parameters based on data 
at the Epoch 2 Month 6 visit for total or baseline-corrected total IgG. 
Quality of Life Assessments 
The mean (SD) change in Peds-QL total, EQ-5D-Y, and VAS scores from baseline to end of Epoch 2 
were small, indicating no changes in HRQoL and health status from baseline to end of Epoch 2. Similar 
findings were observed in the treatment satisfaction scales (TSQM-9 and LQI). A trend towards higher 
treatment satisfaction was observed with HYQVIA in all the TSQM-9 domains (effectiveness, 
convenience and global satisfaction with treatment) and LQI domains (with the exception of the 
therapy setting domain). 
In the treatment preference questionnaire, most subjects receiving HYQVIA responded “like very much’ 
or ‘like” the frequency of administration (88.1%; 50.0%/38.1%); ability to fit treatment into schedule 
(83.3%; 47.6%/35.7%); and overall convenience (81.0%; 38.1/42.9%). Most subjects responded that 
EMA/258995/2023

they preferred to receive treatment at home (85.7%) and that they would choose to continue receiving 
HYQVIA (73.8%). The mean (SE) rate of days wherein subjects were not able to go to school or work 
or perform normal daily activities due to infection or other illness was 4.28 (0.997) days per subject-
year. 
Healthcare Resource Utilization 
Mean (SE) rate of days on antibiotics was 26.77 (5.445) days per subject-year. The mean rate of 
hospitalizations was less than 1 per year, and the mean rate of days hospitalized was less than 1 day 
per year. The mean rate of acute physician visits due to infection or other illness per subject-year was 
less than 5 visits per year. 
Safety results 
Safety analyses of the SC treatment with IG, 10% facilitated with rHuPH20 included all 44 subjects 
with PIDD who had completed Study 161503. All AEs were evaluated by system organ class, preferred 
term (PT), severity, relationship to treatment, and temporal relationship to treatment. 
Safety and tolerability endpoints included: 
• The annual rate of related and not related SAEs. 
• AEs, including and excluding infections. 
• Localized treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
• Systemic TEAEs. 
• Rates of TEAEs by number of infusions. 
Extent of exposure 
Exposure to HYQVIA is summarized in Table 5. Overall, the median duration of exposure for HYQVIA 
was 14.87 months (range: 0.7 to 38.7 months). The median exposure time to HYQVIA was 1.38 
months (range: 0.7 to 1.5 months) and 13.49 months (range: 1.0 to 37.3 months) in Epoch 1 and 
Epoch 2, respectively. The majority of subjects (36 subjects [81.8%]) had exposure to treatment for 
12 to < 24 months. Mean study duration was 14.11 months (range: 0.7 to 38.7 months).

Infusions (Epoch 2) 
Number of Infusions per Month 
There was a total of 633 infusions in Epoch 2. Overall, the median number of infusions per month was 
1.10 (range: 1.0 to 1.5) and were comparable across the age groups. The median number of infusions 
per subject-year overall was 13.18 (range: 11.5 to 17.7) and although comparable among all age 
groups, the age group of 2 to < 6 years had the lowest median number 13.04 of infusions per subject-
year (13.21 and 13.16 for the 6 to < 12 and 12 to < 16 age groups, respectively). 
Overall, the median number of infusions per subject for the duration of Epoch 2 was 15.0 (range 
1 to 38), with the highest median number of infusions per subject in the 2 to < 6 years age group.  
Number of Infusion Sites (Needle-Sticks) per Month 
Overall, the median number of infusion sites per month was 2.17 (range: 1.1 to 2.9), with similar 
median number of infusion sites per month for all the age categories. The mean number of infusion 
sites per infusion was 1.83 (SD 0.366) with a median number of 2.0 infusions (range: to 2.0) and was 
comparable throughout all age groups. 
Duration of Infusion 
Across the age groups, the median (range) duration of infusion ranged from 76.5 (60 to 215) minutes 
in the 2 to < 6 years group to 88.0 (53 to 150) minutes in the 6 to < 12 years group. Overall, the 
median duration of infusion was 85.0 (45 to 215) minutes. 
Maximum Infusion Rate/Site 
Overall, the median maximum infusion rate per site was 160 mL/h (range: 30 to 300 mL/h) with 
a maximum median infusion rate per site of 300 mL/h reported in the 12 to < 16 years age group 
which was higher compared with the other age groups. 
Infusion Volume/Site 
The median infusion volume per site was 85.0 mL (range: 35 to 300 mL) with the highest median 
infusion volume per site of 142.5 mL (range: 75 to 300 mL) reported in subjects aged 12 to < 16 
years compared to the lowest median infusion range of 60.0 mL (range: 35 to 143 mL) in subjects 
aged 2 to < 6 years. 
Number/Proportion of Infusions that were Discontinued, Slowed, or Interrupted Due to an 
Adverse Event 
Overall, a mean of 99.8% (range: 94 to 100%) infusions were completed by subjects across Epochs 1 
and 2. No notable difference was observed between the Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 groups for percentage of 
infusions completed. A mean of 5.9% (SD 8.04, range: 0 to 33%) of infusions were reported to be 
interrupted. The majority of infusions were completed without interruption across both Epoch 1 and 
Epoch 2. A mean of 1.1% (SD 5.27, range: 0 to 25%) infusions were discontinued in Epoch 1, while no 
infusions were discontinued, and no subjects changed regimen due to an AE in Epoch 2. 
Overall, 13 subjects (30.2%) had a total of 17 infusions (2.69% of all infusions) that were interrupted 
due to an AE. Four infusions were interrupted in 3 subjects (33.3%) in the 2 to <6 years age group, 6 
infusions were interrupted in 6 subjects (27.3%) in the 6 to <12 years age group, and 7 infusions were 
interrupted in 4 subjects (33.3%) in the 12 to <16 years age group.

Adverse Events 
Overviews of TEAEs excluding and including infections are presented in Table 6 and Table 7, 
respectively.

Table 7 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Overall Summary (including 
infections) 
A total of 536 TEAEs (excluding infections) were reported in 97.7% of subjects; of which, 336 TEAEs 
were reported as related to study treatment in 77.3% of subjects. 
A total of 4 serious TEAEs (including infections) were reported in 4 subjects (9.1%) and 1 serious TEAE 
(excluding infections) was reported in 1 subject (2.3%). No SAEs were reported that were considered 
by the investigator to be related to HYQVIA. No deaths were reported during the study. 
EMA/258995/2023  
Page 19/23 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of these TEAEs were mild in severity, the 3 severe TEAEs (all systemic) were reported in 
3 subjects (6.8%); of which, 2 severe TEAEs in 2 subjects (4.5%) were related to study treatment, i.e. 
headache and coeliac disease. 
Overall, 334 systemic TEAEs (excluding infections) were reported in 39 subjects (88.6%). The majority 
of the events were assessed as mild and unrelated to study treatment. 
Local TEAEs were reported in 33 subjects (75.0%) and were representative of local reactions at the 
infusion site. The majority of the events were assessed as mild, none were severe, indicating that 
HYQVIA was well tolerated at the injection site. 
Excluding infections, overall rates of related systemic TEAEs per infusion and per subject were 0.190 
and 3.273, respectively. The most commonly reported systemic TEAEs per subject by PT included 
headache, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, nausea, infusion related reaction, pain in extremity, and throat 
irritation.  
Excluding infections, the overall rates of related local TEAEs per infusion and per subject were 0.253 
and 4.364, respectively. The most commonly reported local TEAEs by PT included infusion site pain, 
infusion site pruritus, infusion site erythema, infusion site extravasation, infusion site swelling, and 
injection site pain. This corresponds to lower overall rate of related systemic TEAEs per subject-year 
(2.787) compared with related local TEAEs per subject-year (3.716). The overall rate of unrelated local 
TEAEs per subject-year was 0.194. 
Two subjects (4.5%) discontinued the study due to TEAEs. One subject in Epoch 1 prematurely 
discontinued due to a TEAE of coeliac disease and 1 subject in Epoch 2 prematurely discontinued due 
to a TEAE of infusion site pain. 
Excluding infections, a total of 86.4% of subjects had 382 temporally associated TEAEs and the same 
percentage of subjects had 401 related and/or temporally associated TEAEs. A total of 88.6% of 
subjects had 407 temporally associated TEAEs (including infections) and the same number of subjects 
had 426 related and/or temporally associated TEAEs. 
Including infections, a total of 697 TEAEs were reported in 97.7% of subjects; of which, 336 TEAEs 
were reported as related to study treatment in 77.3% subjects. Including infections, a total of 4 severe 
TEAEs were reported in 9.1% of subjects; of which, 2 TEAEs in 4.5% subjects were related to study 
treatment (headache and coeliac disease). All 4 TEAEs were systemic. 
Systemic TEAEs (including infections) were reported in 93.2% of subjects; however, the majority of 
the events were assessed as unrelated to HYQVIA. Local TEAEs were reported in 75% of subjects and 
represented local reactions at the infusion site. No local severe TEAEs were reported indicating that 
HYQVIA was well tolerated at the injection site. The proportion of subjects experiencing related 
systemic TEAEs was lower (56.8% of subjects) compared to the proportion of subjects experiencing 
related local TEAEs 72.7% of subjects. Assessment of hemolysis and other clinical laboratory 
parameters did not raise any safety concerns with respect to HYQVIA administration. 
One subject developed a titer of binding antibodies against rHuPH20 above the threshold defined as 
positive (≥160) at Epoch 2 Month 6. Neutralizing antibodies against rHuPH20 were negative for this 
subject at all time points tested. The subject completed 2 additional years of study treatment and 
assessments in Epoch 2, as per protocol, including ongoing assessments of antibodies against rHuPH20 
- no safety concerns were identified. Additional testing for characterization of antibodies cross-reacting 
with Hyal 1, 2, and 4 and complement activity were performed per protocol. Antibodies cross-reacting 
with Hyal 1, 2 and 4 were negative. Complement activity of C3, C4, C1q Binding and Raji cell complex 
were normal; CH50 was abnormal, but no evidence of complement consumption or immune complex 
formation was noted. 
Overall, 65 TEAEs were reported for this subject, among them 53 AEs were mild, and 12 AEs moderate 
in nature. No severe, serious or ASBI events were reported for this subject. A total of 47 TEAEs were 
reported as related to HYQVIA occurred before or after anti-rHuPH20 antibodies titer increase >160 at 
Epoch 2 Month 6 Visit. Related AEs were mild and moderate in nature, self-resolved in the majority of 
cases. Anti-rHuPH20 antibodies findings were not associated with modifications in the study drug’s 
peak PK, and no reduction of HYQVIA therapeutic efficacy was noted in the subject. 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in serum trough IgG levels between age groups during 
Epoch 2, with the highest median change from the Month 0 baseline measurement of <1.3 g/L. A 
EMA/258995/2023

similar trend was observed for IgG subclass results with stable levels across Epoch 2 and no notable 
age group differences for the first 12 months across Epoch 2. 
Overall, the median number of infusions, infusion per month, and number of infusion sites were similar 
for all age categories, as observed from the mode of administration results. Subjects in the age group 
of 2 to < 6 years had a lower median number of infusion sites per infusion/month compared with other 
age groups. 
Overall, the median number of infusions per subject for the duration of Epoch 2 was 15.0, with the 
highest median number of infusions per subject in the age group of 2 to < 6 years. The median 
(minimum, maximum) duration of infusion (minutes) was similar cross the age groups, with high 
variability within groups. The age group of 12 to < 16 years had higher median maximum infusion 
rates per site compared with the other age groups. The median infusion volume per site was 85.0 mL. 
Subjects aged 12 to < 16 years had a higher median infusion volume per site compared with other age 
groups. In spite of infusion interruptions, the majority of subjects completed their infusions. 
Overall, the median time to reach final dose interval (defined as 3 or 4 weeks) in Epoch 1 was 6.14 
weeks and was similar in all the age categories. A total of 32 subjects (74.4%) maintained a treatment 
interval of 3 or 4 weeks in Epoch 2 for 12 months. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Methodology 
The MAH submitted clinical data resulting from the completed interventional Phase 3 study 161503 
entitled “Efficacy, Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of HYQVIA in 
Pediatric Subjects with Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases”. This study was an open-label, 
prospective, non-controlled, multi-center study conducted in 17 study centers in the United States and 
part of the clinical development programme. It was conducted with the purpose to acquire additional 
data on the efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and other parameters of HYQVIA in 
pediatric subjects aged ≥2 to < 16 years with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD).  
The study objectives were the demonstration of efficacy of HYQVIA treatment in pediatric subjects with 
PIDD who received prior IVIG or SCIG therapy before enrollment into the study as well as further 
efficacy and safety assessments, tolerability, PK parameters, characteristics of product administration, 
treatment preference and satisfaction, and health-related quality of life.  
Determined key efficacy-endpoints were the annual rate of acute serious bacterial infections (ASBI), 
the annual rate of infection, and trough levels of total IgG, IgG subclasses, and of specific antibodies. 
Safety-related endpoints were the number and rate per infusion of treatment-emergent adverse 
events, as well as their temporal relationship, and number/proportion of subjects who developed 
positive titers (≥160) of binding or neutralizing antibodies to rHuPH20. PK-related assessments of 
observed total IgG levels included standard PK parameters (AUC, CL/F, C/Tmax, Cmin, and terminal 
half-life). The endpoint selection is considered adequate, as endpoints are well-established in clinical 
studies evaluating SCIG replacement therapy in patients with PIDD in routine clinical practice, and in 
line with the Guideline on the clinical investigation of human normal immunoglobulin for subcutaneous 
and/or intramuscular administration (SCIg/IMIg). 
The study included 3 Epochs; Epoch 1 and 2 were treatment periods, and Epoch 3 was an optional 
one-year safety follow-up for those patients who had developed an anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer of 
≥160 during the first two Epochs in combination with either a study drug-related SAE or severe 
treatment-related AE. However, the third Epoch was not initiated, as no study subject had fulfilled 
these criteria.  
In Epoch 1, subjects received on-site HyQvia SC with a dose or interval ramp-up period of up to 6 
weeks, followed by a one-year Epoch 2, where HyQvia treatment was administered in 3- or 4-weekly 
intervals depending on the subject’s pretreatment, i.e. IVIG or another SCIG. Home administration was 
allowed if infusions had been well tolerated on-site.  
Based on anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody assay results, Epoch 2 and HyQvia treatment, respectively, 
was extended up to 3 years or study participation was terminated.  
EMA/258995/2023  
Page 21/23 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects had a diagnosis of PIDD requiring gammaglobulin replacement, and receiving a stable dose 
between 0.3-1.0 g/kg/bw Q4W for a period of at least 3 months prior to screening. Serum trough 
levels had to be >5 g/L at screening. Patients were excluded if they had laboratory values indicating 
anemia, neutropenia, liver dysfunction, or specific infections, an ongoing history of hypersensitivity or 
persistent reactions following IVIG/SCIG administration, known intolerance of hyluronidase, and IgA 
deficiency. The eligibility criteria are considered adequate. 
Efficacy and safety results 
Study subjects’ weekly HyQvia dose was equivalent to the IG treatment received before. The infusion 
rates and volumes were administered weight-based according to the SmPC. 
Overall, 44 paediatric subjects met the eligibility criteria and thus, were enrolled and received study 
medication. 34/44 (77.3%) thereof completed the study. Reasons for premature study discontinuation 
were withdrawal by subject (6), adverse events (2), COVID-19 constraint (1) and physician’s decision 
(1). Until the database lock date for final analysis of November 2022, the 34 subjects had completed 
the Epoch 2, and no subject met the criteria for entering Epoch 3.  
As primary immunodeficiencies appear to affect males and females about equally, the study population 
was imbalanced as to gender. The age distribution is considered suboptimal, however, may be 
accepted as at least 20% of all patients were included in the youngest cohort. Most patients had a 
diagnosis of CVID or a specific antibody deficiency. In the context of the primary disease, the most 
frequently reported medical history by SOC was infections and immune system disorders as well as 
metabolism and nutrition disorders, and concomitant medications were drugs for obstructive airway 
diseases, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory products and analgesics. 
According to the primary objective of the study, the rate of ASBI, defined as the mean number of 
ASBIs per subject-year in the intent-to-treat population (FAS) was assessed. Only one subject 
experienced two ASBIS, resulting in a mean rate of ASBIs per subject-year of 0.04, which is 
statistically lower than the threshold rate of 1.0 ASBI per subject-year, and thus acceptable (cf. 
Guideline on the clinical investigation of human normal immunoglobulin for subcutaneous and/or 
intramuscular administration (SCIg/IMIg). Thus, the primary endpoint of the study was met. 
The mean rate of all infections per subject-year is well within the range of a healthy reference 
population. Total serum IgG, IgG subclass and specific antibody trough levels were stable from 
baseline throughout the study and no meaningful differences between age groups were observed.  
No changes in HRQoL and health status were observed from baseline to the end of the study 
suggesting satisfaction with the HyQvia treatment in the studied population. Other assessed outcomes 
such as the mean rate of days of absence from school or work due to illness or those associated with 
healthcare resource utilization, i.e. days on antibiotics, hospitalization rate or acute physician visits 
substantiate the efficacy of HyQvia in the investigated study subjects.  
Overall, the median duration of exposure for HYQVIA was 14.87 months and the majority of subjects 
had a treatment exposure for 12-24 months. The mean number of infusion sites per infusion was low, 
the time required for the total infusion and infusion rate per site were within the usual range for 
HyQvia across the different paediatric age groups as well as the infusions per month. The number of 
infusions per subject-year was balanced across the age groups. A small percentage of infusions was 
interrupted due to treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs); however, no infusion was discontinued 
and no subject changed in regimen due to a TEAE.  
Most events were reported in Epoch 2 due to the longer treatment and observation period. The 
frequencies of TEAE categories were comparable between both safety analysis sets, either in- or 
excluding infections. Overall, almost all subjects experienced TEAEs. The majority experienced mild 
and local TEAE. A few severe TEAEs were observed, two thereof were assessed as related to study 
treatment (headache and coeliac disease). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were rare, and observed 
SAEs were assessed to be unrelated to HyQvia treatment. Most commonly reported TEAE in both 
treatment Epochs that were deemed related to HyQvia treatment were local infusion site reactions 
such as infusion/injection site pain, pruritus, erythema, swelling, and systemic TEAEs such as 
EMA/258995/2023  
Page 22/23 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
headache, fatigue and infusion-related nausea/vomiting. The frequencies gradually decreased over 
time. Overall, the rates of related local and systemic per infusion and per subject seem to be 
comparable compared with the literature considering slightly different subject numbers and 
observation periods (cf. Wassermann et al., 2016). Those TEAEs that continued to occur at a later 
stage of the study were headache and injection-site reactions. In each of the both Epochs, one subject 
experienced a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation (coeliac disease, see above and injection site 
pain), thus, discontinuation rates are low. Parameters indicative of hemolysis did not significantly 
change throughout the study, and none of the viral serology laboratory values were clinically 
significant. Antibodies against rHuPH20 without neutralizing function were detected in a single patient, 
however, were not associated with reduced efficacy; no additional antibodies were observed. Thus, the 
immunogenic effect of HyQvia was slightly lower in this very study compared with the paediatric study 
population included in the pivotal study.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy of HyQvia was confirmed in the selected paediatric study population, as the replacement 
therapy was effective in maintaining Ig trough levels and preventing serious bacterial and all kinds of 
infections in PIDD patients throughout the study period. The safety analysis of study 161503 did not 
reveal any unusual findings, thus, the treatment seemed to have been tolerated adequately. Most 
patients favoured treatment continuation with HyQvia. It is therefore concurred that the benefit-risk 
ratio remains unchanged and that no amendments of the Product Information are necessary.

No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare, serious, and debilitating condition caused by 
overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by a tumour (Minisola et al. 2017). The causative 
tumours are typically phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours (PMTs), an extremely rare and heterogeneous 
set of bone and soft tissue tumours that have a distinct histological appearance (Folpe et al. 2004; 
Bahrami et al. 2009). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The therapeutic indication proposed by the Applicant is “Crysvita is indicated for the treatment of FGF23-
related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal 
tumours that cannot be curatively resected or localised, in patients aged 1 year and over.” 
Epidemiology  
Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours (PMT) can affect a wide age range of patients, but most cases occur 
in middle-aged adults. There does not seem to be a predisposition for the tumour to occur in either sex, 
but a small female predominance has been observed. 
A recent European study has shown that the incidence of TIO in Denmark for the period 2008-2018 was 
estimated as being below 0.13 per 100,000 person years for the total population of the country and 
below 0.09 per 100,000 in adults. The prevalence of TIO was estimated to be no more than 0.70 per 
100,000 persons for the total population and 0.26 per 100,000 persons in adults. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Most PMTs are benign, although several cases of multifocal and malignant PMTs have been reported in 
the literature (Folpe et al. 2004; Weidner and Santa Cruz 1987; Yamada et al. 2017; Yavropoulou et al. 
2018); however, PMTs aberrantly produce high levels of circulating FGF23. 
FGF23 was initially identified as the protein encoded by the mutated gene in autosomal dominant 
hypophosphataemic rickets (ADHR), a hereditary disorder of phosphate wasting. Subsequently, FGF23 
was found to be overexpressed in tumour tissue obtained from patients with TIO and was identified as 
the key causative factor of the phosphate wasting syndrome in these patients (Shimada et al. 2001). 
Although the underlying causes of ADHR, TIO, and X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) are unique, all 
conditions are characterised by elevated FGF-23, resulting in excessive renal phosphate wasting by 
impaired phosphate reabsorption, reduced vitamin D synthesis and chronic hypophosphataemia.

EMA/634749/2022

Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
As PMTs are usually small and seldom give local symptoms, the symptomatology in TIO is normally 
related to skeletal consequences of poorly mineralised bone related to chronic hypophosphataemia, such 
as osteomalacia, fractures, and pseudofractures. These skeletal defects manifest as musculoskeletal pain, 
proximal muscle weakness, fatigue, and reduced health-related quality of life. In children, TIO is rarer 
than in adults, and the condition may present with generalised osteopenia, rickets, pseudofractures, 
bowing of the extremities, gait abnormalities, growth retardation, and pain in the bones, joints, and 
muscles (Jan de Beur 2005).  
Since FGF23 levels observed in TIO are generally higher than those seen in XLH, the resultant 
hypophosphataemia and downstream clinical syndrome is often more severe. The greater severity of the 
downstream consequences and symptomatic manifestations of phosphate wasting may also result from 
the lack of adaptation, since TIO is an acquired condition. The average time from onset of symptoms to 
diagnosis of TIO is 2.5 years (Drezner 1999). The delay in diagnosis can be attributed to various factors, 
including the rarity of the condition, the nonspecific and broad nature of the presenting symptoms such 
as bone/muscle pain or fatigue, and serum phosphate not typically being assessed as part of routine 
blood chemistry. 
Management 
When possible, tumour resection is the first line of treatment for TIO and can be curative. However, 
identifying the location of the causative tumour is often difficult, despite functional and anatomical 
imaging. When tumour resection is feasible, FGF23 levels decrease within minutes of tumour removal 
(Colangelo et al. 2018), serum phosphate levels return to normal within days (Shane et al. 1997; Siris et 
al. 1987), and symptoms resolve within months (Yu et al. 2017; Kumar et al. 2015), depending on the 
severity of the disease, it may take up to a year for significant clinical improvement to be seen 
(Dadoniene et al. 2016).  
Approximately 35% to 40% of patients with TIO have tumours that cannot be localised and therefore 
cannot be surgically excised (Chong et al. 2013; Imel et al. 2006). When the tumour cannot be located or 
when complete resection is not possible, medical treatment should be initiated (Minisola et al. 2017; 
Ruppe 2013). 
Current medical management includes treatment with multiple daily doses of oral phosphate and active 
vitamin D analogues. The phosphate dose required to improve clinical symptoms is often limited by 
intolerable gastrointestinal side effects. In some cases, active vitamin D alone may be administered 
(Geller et al. 2007).  
Oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy improves symptoms in some patients with TIO (Zuo et al. 2017) 
but is ineffective in others (Breer et al. 2014; Wasserman et al. 2016). The regimen does not correct 
renal phosphate wasting, the underlying cause of hypophosphataemia, and resultant osteomalacia. In 
addition, oral phosphate therapy may exacerbate phosphate wasting by increasing the renal phosphate 
load since the impairment in renal phosphate reabsorption due to excess FGF23 is not addressed. The 
intermittent phosphate load also triggers high urinary phosphate excretion and increases the risk and 
progression of nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. In some instances, the compensatory increases in 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) may increase the risk of developing secondary or tertiary 
hyperparathyroidism, which in turn can lead to hypercalciuria, and thereby further increase the risk of 
nephrocalcinosis. As such, oral phosphate/active vitamin D treatment requires frequent monitoring to 
mitigate the risks of nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism (Jan de Beur 2005).

Alternative treatment approaches, such as image-guided cryoablation, heat ablation using 
radiofrequency, and radiation therapy have shown varying degrees of success in TIO patients with 
inoperable tumours (Jadhav et al. 2014; Tarasova et al. 2013; Tella et al. 2017).  
An unmet need for additional treatments of subjects with TIO with tumours that cannot be localised and 
therefore cannot be surgically excised is agreed with the MAH 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Burosumab is a fully human recombinant human IgG1 mAb designed to bind to and thereby inhibit the 
biological activity of FGF23. Based on its mechanism of action of targeting excess FGF23, burosumab is 
only intended to address the FGF23-driven pathophysiology of TIO and is not expected to impact the 
natural course of the underlying tumour. 
A conditional Marketing Authorisation for treatment of XLH in the paediatric population was granted in the 
EU on 19 Feb 2018.  
Burosumab is currently approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of XLH in children and 
adolescents aged 1 to 17 years with radiographic evidence of bone disease, and in adults. 
Burosumab was approved in the United States on 17 Apr 2018 for the treatment of XLH in adult and 
paediatric patients 1 year of age and older; the indication was subsequently expanded on 27 Sep 2019 to 
include paediatric patients 6 months of age and older. A subsequent approval to extend the indication for 
treatment of TIO associated with PMTs was granted in the US in June 2020. Marketing Authorisation was 
also granted in Japan in September 2019 and South Korea in September 2020, for the treatment of 
patients with FGF23-related hypophosphataemic rickets and osteomalacia, which includes both XLH and 
TIO. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 were conducted in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A signed ERA justification statement is included. There are no major updates to this compared with that 
already registered within the dossier. The only changes reflect the proposed additional indication. 
KRN23 is a human IgG monoclonal antibody and can reasonably be expected to be subject to the same 
degradative pathways and to have the same environmental impact as naturally occurring human 
antibodies, therefore due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Burosumab PK and PD data were previously characterised and submitted for both adults and paediatric 
patients who have XLH. Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) data of burosumab in the TIO patient population 
was collected in studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002. To support the characterisation of burosumab PK 
and PK/PD, modelling and simulations were performed using data from the aforementioned adult TIO 
studies, and PK and PD data from adult and paediatric XLH patients, who were enrolled in the clinical 
trials KRN23-US-02, KRN23-INT-001, KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL201, UX023-CL205, UX023-CL203, 
UX023-CL303, UX023-CL301, and UX023-CL304. Further, modelling and simulation using data from these 
studies were used to support dosing in paediatric patients who have TIO. 
In summary, following single or repeat dose SC administrations, burosumab serum concentrations 
displayed an approximate mono-exponential decline. Apparent elimination half-life was estimated to 
approximately 19 days in the adult XLH patient population. Dose-linear, time-invariant PK were observed 
within a repeat SC dose range of 0.05-1.0 mg/kg. The absolute bioavailability from SC administration was 
determined to be approximately 100%. 
Analytical methods 
An updated electrochemiluminescence-based assay for the detection of anti-burosumab antibodies was 
used in Study KRN23-002; results showed the assay to be the same as the previously submitted method 
that was used for Study UX023T-CL201. Assays to measure burosumab concentrations in serum, and to 
evaluate immunogenicity (anti-drug antibodies [ADA]) and total and free (unbound) FGF23, serum 
phosphorus and bone turnover markers were described previously. 
Validation Report P1833418 
The method described in the validation report was used in study KRN23-002. This assay relies on the 
assay previously validated, which was part of EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G. 
A multitiered strategy (screening, confirmation, titer) was applied. Samples were first diluted with acid 
solution and incubated with excess of biotinylated KRN23 to capture the anti-KRN23 antibodies in a 96 
well plate. Then the biotinylated KRN23 and anti-KRN23 antibodies complexes were captured with 
streptavidin magnetic beads. Subsequently, acid was added to dissociate the captured immunocomplexes 
and elute the antibodies. Biotinylated KRN23 and ruthenylated KRN23 in alkaline solutions were added to 
neutralize the acid and form immunocomplexes with anti-KRN23 antibodies. The immunocomplexes were 
added to a MSD streptavidin plate and then incubated. Finally, the plate was read to determine the 
electrochemiluminescence signals.

Table 2: Validation summary for the SPEAD-ECL ADA assay 
A full validation was performed (see Table 2). Anti-KRN23 monkey antibodies were used as the positive 
control (LPC 100 ng/mL, MPC 500 ng/mL and HPC 2000 ng/mL). 55 individual samples from healthy 
subjects analysed in 6 runs by 2 analysts were used for setting the respective cutpoints. In the screening 
assay, 13 outliers were removed using box plot analysis. As the response ratios were found normally 
distributed, the cutpoint was calculated at 5% false positive rate (FPR) using the parametric approach. In 
the confirmatory assay, 10 outliers were removed using the box plot analysis, and the cutpoint was 
calculated at 1% FPR using the parametric approach. Selectivity was demonstrated in individual samples 
(healthy, 10 individuals; haemolytic, 5 individuals; hyperlipidaemic, 5 individuals). 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A population PK analysis was used to determine the characteristics of burosumab in subjects with TIO. 
Since the PK samples collected from the 27 subjects with TIO were sparsely sampled, a pooled analysis 
approach with data from adult and paediatric XLH patients was used to support the burosumab population 
PK model. PK and PD data from adult and paediatric XLH patients, who were enrolled in the clinical trials 
KRN23-US-02, KRN23-INT-001, KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL201, UX023-CL205, UX023-CL203, UX023-
CL303, UX023-CL301, and UX023-CL304, were included in the analysis. Study details for subjects with 
XLH were provided in the previous population PK and PK/PD report. Details on the dose regimens, 
planned PK and PK/PD schedules and number of subjects of the clinical trials for subjects with TIO are 
presented in Table 3.

A total of 306 subjects (27 with TIO and 279 XLH) treated with burosumab were included in the current 
population PK and PK/PD analyses. Among them, 94 were children (six subjects aged 1 to 2 years old and 
88 subjects aged 2 to 12 years old) and 212 were adults. All the 27 subjects with TIO were adults.

those two patients were included in the XLH population. 
Marked differences were observed in baseline levels of serum FGF23, bone and serum ALP between TIO 
and XLH populations. The median value of baseline FGF23 levels was 4.6-fold higher in adults with TIO 
than that in adults with XLH. The median baseline value of bone ALP was 1.8-fold higher in adults with 
TIO than that in adults with XLH. Similarly, median baseline serum ALP levels were 2.2-fold higher in 
adults with TIO than that in adults with XLH. Overall, these baseline data indicate that serum FGF23 
levels were higher, and the bone manifestations associated with hypophosphataemia may be more severe 
in adult subjects with TIO, compared to adult subjects with XLH. 
In both TIO studies all enrolled subjects began treatment with burosumab at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg 
(Week 0). In Study UX023T-CL201, following the titration period (Weeks 0-16), the median dose was 0.9 
mg/kg at Week 20, 0.9 mg/kg at Week 48, 0.7 mg/kg at Week 96, and 0.6 mg/kg at Week 144. In Study 
KRN23-002, following the titration period (Weeks 0-16), the median dose was 0.7 mg/kg at Week 20, 0.8 
mg/kg at Week 48, and 1.0 mg/kg at Week 88.  
Numbers of individual samples of measurable and BLQ burosumab concentrations in TIO and XLH 
subjects are presented in Table and the distribution of observed burosumab concentrations in TIO 
subjects are visualised in Figure 1. In subjects with TIO, steady-state conditions were reached after 
approximately 20 weeks of the dosing titration period (i.e., similar trough medians), with median trough 
value of 3190 ng/mL in Study UX023T-CL201 and 2710 ng/mL in Study KRN23-002 (Figure 1) at Week 
20. Median values at Week 22 (i.e., 2 weeks after the SC administration) were 6790 ng/mL and 6880 
ng/mL for studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002, respectively.

Figure 1: Distribution of Observed Concentrations of Burosumab in Subjects with TIO Stratified by Study 
Model Development 
Non-Linear Mixed Effect (NLME) population PK and PK/PD analyses were performed. Dataset exploration, 
figures and tables, as well as posterior Bayes estimation of exposure parameter values for individual 
subjects, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations, were performed using R® V3.5 
The structural population PK model of burosumab previously developed for XLH subjects was re-evaluated 
with the updated dataset incorporating 334 additional PK samples collected from TIO studies (KRN23-002 
and UX023T-CL201). Overall model evaluations suggest that the structural PK model developed for XLH 
was able to describe the PK of burosumab in subjects with TIO adequately, supporting a similar PK 
between the two disease populations. As a sensitivity analysis, the parameters were re-estimated with PK 
data collected only from TIO population and the results were compared to those obtained from the 
combined population. With the exception of CL/F, the relative differences between the PK parameters 
were less than 20%. The estimate of CL/F derived from TIO population was approximately 20% higher 
than that derived from the combined population, which was not considered clinically significant. As the 
integrated population PK model combing XLH and TIO populations provided more robust and stable 
parameter estimates, further model development for TIO proceeded with the combined PK datasets 
collected from both TIO and XLH populations. 
The relationships between covariates and PK parameters were initially explored graphically to select 
potential covariates affecting the PK of burosumab. The following baseline covariates were explored: age, 
sex, body mass index (BMI), race, ethnicity, weight, height, serum FGF23, albumin, serum ALP, bone 
ALP, alanine aminotransferase, baseline creatinine, CrCL, country, study, and disease. No relevant trend 
was observed between PK parameters and respective covariates by graphical evaluations. To investigate 
covariates associated with TIO specifically, the effect of disease population (i.e., XLH vs. TIO) and serum

FGF23 at the baseline were further tested in the population PK model. Overall evaluations indicate that 
these two covariates did not influence burosumab PK to any extent that is statistically significant or 
clinically important. Therefore, the disease population and serum FGF23 at baseline were not retained in 
the final population PK model of burosumab. 
Final Population PK Model 
The final population PK model of burosumab was comprised of a first-order absorption from the SC 
injection, one-compartmental distribution, followed by the linear elimination. Body weight-based 
allometric scaling of CL/F and V/F was incorporated into the model. No other covariates were included in 
the final model. The population PK parameter values and associated uncertainties derived from the final 
model are presented in Table for a typical adult subject with TIO having a body weight of 70 kg. Model 
diagnostics as per Goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks are displayed in Table 8 and Figure 
2, respectively.

XLH 
Based on the estimated absorption rate constant (Ka), the corresponding absorption half-life was 
approximately 43 hours (~1.8 days) suggesting that the absorption of burosumab would be completed 
within ~9 days (~5 × t1/2), which should approximate the time to maximum concentration value of 
burosumab from SC administrations. The model-estimated CL/F and V/F suggest that burosumab is 
slowly cleared from the circulation with a limited distribution within body’s extracellular water volume (~ 
0.1 L/kg). These PK parameters for burosumab in subjects with TIO were similar to those previously 
obtained in subjects with XLH. In adult subjects with TIO having a median body weight of 76 kg, CL/F and 
V/F of burosumab were projected to be 0.305 L/day and 8.03 L, respectively. Corresponding elimination 
t1/2 was projected to be ~18 days. Based on the predicted burosumab t1/2 value, the time to reach ~90% 
PK steady state was approximately 64 days with a fixed dosing regimen. 
Body weight was the only covariate included in the model to explain variability in CL/F and V/F as 
consistent with the previous analysis in subjects with XLH and is supportive of utilising a weight-adjusted 
administration regimen for burosumab. The model-based analysis indicates that baseline FGF23 did not 
affect the PK parameters of burosumab in subjects with TIO. As only two TIO subjects tested positive for 
ADAs over the entire treatment period a model-based analysis for ADA as a covariate was not possible in 
the current analysis. In the previous analysis with XLH studies, impact of ADA and NAb status on PK 
parameters of burosumab was deemed not significant. 
Predicted exposure levels 
The descriptive statistics of individual predicted (using the final burosumab PK model) burosumab 
exposure levels along with actual dose levels are presented in Table 9 with stratification by body weight.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Serum phosphate is the primary pharmacodynamic (PD) marker for burosumab and directly reflects its 
mechanism of action to inhibit FGF23 and restore renal phosphate reabsorption. This is further discussed 
under Clinical efficacy below.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The population PK/PD analysis was conducted based on the simulated burosumab PK profiles in individual 
subjects using the established population PK model, and time-matched, serum phosphate as the PD 
endpoint. The relationship between the serum levels of burosumab and phosphate have previously been 
explored in subjects with XLH (EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0000 and EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G). A sigmoid 
Emax model described the observed serum phosphate following various regimens of burosumab via a SC 
route. A moderate but statistically significant effect of body weight on E0 and Emax were incorporated 
into the final model. The typical value of EC50 was 3819 ng/mL, which is time-invariant irrespective of 
subject’s age and body weight (ULTR-PMX-BUROSUMAB-1280).  
Data 
A total of 298 patients (27 adults with TIO, 177 adults with XLH and 94 paediatrics with XLH) were 
included in PK/PD analysis. As illustrated in Figure 4, tentative negative relationships were observed 
between serum phosphorus and FGF23 levels at baseline in both populations (more pronounced in the 
TIO population) and the average levels of baseline serum phosphorus were lower in subjects with TIO. In 
adult subjects included in the PK/PD analysis, median of baseline FGF23 was about 4.8–fold higher in 
subjects with TIO, in comparison to the median observed in adults with XLH.

development of the population PK/PD model in subjects with XLH and TIO, which is more than 2-fold the 
number of PK samples included in the population PK analysis (Table). The serum phosphorus 
concentrations collected in the TIO and XLH represented 8.7% and 91.3% of the overall PD dataset, 
respectively.

Model development  
An integrated PK/PD model was evaluated for its suitability to describe burosumab PK and PD data for the 
combined TIO and XLH datasets. A revised sigmoid Emax model was able to adequately describe the 
PK/PD relationship for the TIO and XLH populations. The effect of body weight on the model parameters 
was incorporated into the structural model. 
The PK/PD relationship specific to subjects with TIO were explored further through the evaluation of 
relevant covariates on the model parameters. The relationships between covariates and PK/PD 
parameters were initially explored graphically to identify covariates affecting the PK/PD relationship 
between burosumab and serum phosphate. Graphical analyses indicated that no relevant trend was 
observed between model parameters and respective covariates except for FGF23 levels at the baseline. 
Since median baseline levels of serum FGF23 and ALP in subjects with TIO were markedly higher than 
those in subjects with XLH, these two covariates were formally tested in the population PK/PD model. 
Final PK/PD Model for TIO Subjects 
The final population PK/PD model in subjects with TIO was composed of a sigmoid Emax model including 
E0, Emax, EC50, and Hill coefficient. The time-varying body weight and the serum FGF23 at the baseline 
was retained as statistically significant covariates in the final model. The typical estimates of model 
parameters and associated uncertainties in subjects with TIO are presented in Table 6. Model diagnostics, 
presented as goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks are visualised in XX and YY, respectively.

Figure 7: Visual Predictive Check of Burosumab Concentration/Serum Phosphorus Relationship for SC 
Administration of Burosumab in Subjects with TIO and XLH 
Although E0 was affected by body weight with statistical significance, the magnitude of this effect was not 
clinically meaningful. For example, model estimated E0 values were 2.20 mg/dL and 1.79 mg/dL based 
on the minimum and maximum body weight values observed in the TIO studies (i.e. 36.4 kg and 150 kg, 
respectively), which is a moderate difference of ~20%. 
Baseline FGF23 was shown to be inversely related to E0 and directly related to EC50. Thus, serum 
phosphate concentrations are dependent upon FGF23 levels. Because hypophosphataemia is driven by 
excess FGF23 and burosumab is a specific antibody against FGF23, the above correlations between 
baseline FGF23 and E0/EC50 is anticipated. It appears that the on-target pharmacological potency (i.e., 
EC50) of burosumab is dependent on baseline FGF23 level. The model-estimated EC50 in a subject with 
the lowest baseline FGF23 (84.5 pg/mL) was approximately one-third compared to that in a subject with 
a median baseline FGF23 (356 pg/mL). Likewise, model-estimated EC50 value in a subject with the 
highest observed baseline FGF23 (2694 pg/mL in this study population) would be ~4-fold higher 
compared to that in a subject with the median baseline FGF23. Accordingly, these subjects may require 
higher titrated doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effects. 
Monte-Carlo Simulations to Support Dosing Regimens of Burosumab in Adult Subjects with TIO 
As indicated in the previous section, the dosing regimen to target a desired PD effect (i.e., normalisation 
of serum phosphate level) may be different in individual subjects with TIO depending on the individual 
baseline FGF23 levels. To explore the optimised dosing regimen in subjects with TIO, a virtual population 
of 1000 patients with TIO was derived from the baseline levels of body weight and FGF23 observed in 
adults obtained from two clinical studies (UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002). A stratified random sampling 
was conducted to select TIO patients based on the observed baseline FGF23 levels by quartile groups: 
84.5-210, 210-364, 64-1144 and 1144-2694 pg/mL. The population PK and PK/PD models were used to

(0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg Q4W) and two Q2W doses (1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg Q2W). Distributions of 
Cmin, Cmax and Cavg of burosumab concentrations and serum phosphorus levels for all dosing regimens 
are respectively presented in Figure 8 and Figure 9 by FGF23 categories. 1000 simulations were 
performed for each FGF23 quartile, i.e. 1000 PK and subsequent serum phosphorus profiles.

A 0.3 mg/kg Q4W dose of burosumab is predicted to achieve serum phosphate concentration within the 
normal ranges for the majority of subjects in the 1st and 2nd quartile of FGF23 (84.5 to 364 pg/mL) at 
Cmax and Cave and approximately 50% of subjects in the 3rd quartile of FGF23 (363.7 to 1144 pg/mL) 
at Cmax. The median baseline FGF23 levels across the 27 adult TIO subject enrolled in the study was 356 
pg/mL, indicating that the baseline FGF23 levels for the majority of the 27 adult subjects with TIO 
enrolled in Studies UX023-CL201 and KRN23-002 are clustered toward the lower range. However, the 
model and simulations also indicate higher dose levels may be required to achieve optimal therapeutic 
effects for certain TIO subjects with high baseline FGF23. For example, for subjects with the baseline 
FGF23 in the 4th quartile (i.e., 1144 to 2694 pg/mL), the simulation results suggest that 2.0 mg/kg Q4W 
may still be sub-optimal and a higher dose up to 2.0 mg/kg Q2W may be necessary to achieve the 
desired PD effects. 
Monte-Carlo Simulation to Support Dosing Regimens of Burosumab in Paediatric Subjects with 
TIO 
The population PK and PK/PD models in adults with TIO were used to simulate the burosumab exposure 
and serum phosphate to support dosing regimen in paediatric patients with TIO from 1 to 17 years of

age. The distribution of body weight in paediatric subjects with TIO was assumed to be same with that in 
healthy paediatric subjects. This information was obtained from the growth chart maintained at the 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States (CDC, 2019). Subjects were 
stratified across age tiers and body weights as summarised in Table 12. For the simulation, baseline 
serum FGF23 was fixed at 356 pg/mL, the median value in adult subjects with TIO from two clinical 
studies. This value was comparable to that observed from four case studies in paediatric subjects with 
TIO (3 to 14 years of age) available in the literature (Imel et al. 2006; Fernandez-Cooke et al. 2015). 
Burosumab and serum phosphate levels were simulated at steady-state conditions based on dosing 
regimens of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg Q2W as well as 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg Q4W and 
serum phosphate levels were compared with the target interval in healthy paediatric subjects based on 
age groups (i.e., 3.2 to 6.5 mg/dL and 2.3 to 4.5 mg/dL for the age groups of 1 to 12 years and 13 to 17 
years, respectively).

Table 13 Percentages of Subjects with Simulated Serum Phosphorus Outside the Normal Range by Dose 
Levels and Age Groups 
The dose of 0.4 mg/kg Q2W predicted to result in a proportion of paediatric TIO patients reaching normal 
serum phosphate levels. Approximately 55 to 36 to percent of TIO patients from 1 to 12 years of age, 
respectively and 85 percent of TIO patients from ages 13 to 17 are predicted to reach serum phosphate 
levels above the lower limit of normal at Cmin (3.2 and 2.3 mg/dL, respectively). In addition, the 
modeling simulations predict that no subjects from the ages ranging from 1 to 12 years of age and only 
1% of adolescent patients ranging from the 13 to 17 years of age are predicted to achieve serum 
phosphate levels above the upper limit of normal at Cmax (6.5 and 4.5 mg/dL, respectively). The dosing 
regimen up to 2.0 mg/kg Q2W (the highest dose simulated) appears to be safe, considering no 
hyperphosphatemia was projected in pediatric TIO patients ages 1 to 12 years of age and < 7% of 
adolescent TIO patient ages 13 to 17 year of age are predicted to reach serum phosphate levels above 
the upper limit of normal.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Individual dosing of Crysvita is based on titration to maintain normal serum phosphorus levels. In both 
TIO clinical trials the starting dose was 0.3 mg/kg. In Study UX023T-CL201, the median dose was 0.9 
mg/kg at Week 48, and in Study KRN23-002, 0.8 mg/kg at Week 48. 
Bioanalytical methods 
With the exception of the update to the ADA assay, all other assays used for sample analysis have been 
described in previous submissions. An ECL assay is used for screening patient samples for ADA. There are 
two versions of this assay, based on the same principles, but performed at different laboratories. Full 
details of the first method were previously submitted in procedure EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G. This 
assay was used to evaluate ADA samples in clinical study UX023T-CL201. Within the current type II 
variation, data has been presented for a second assay, which was used to screen patient samples in 
clinical study KRN23-002.  
The second ECL method has been validated in line with the general principles of the Guideline on 
Immunogenicity assessment of therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev1). The method 
is sufficiently sensitive and is not subject to any apparent hook effect. Selectivity was evaluated in 
healthy, haemolytic and hyperlipidemic samples and no interference was observed at the low positive 
control level of 100 ng/ml. Data to support selectivity in relevant patient population was provided. The 
method demonstrated increased drug tolerance when compared to the first method. The MAH has 
justified the demonstration of tolerance using a single run on the basis of the precision and robustness of 
the method. While, it would be usual to see multiple runs performed for evaluation of drug tolerance, it is 
acknowledged that the method has good precision. The precision of the screening and confirmatory 
assays and the reproducibility of the titration assay are acceptable. The cut point determination follows a 
standard approach and is, generally, acceptable. The procedure for exclusion of outliers is described and 
is acceptable. However, it is noted that healthy patients were used to derive the cut point. The MAH 
justified the use of the healthy subject cutpoint in the ADA analysis of samples from study KRN23-002 by 
the very limited availability of sample from TIO patients and the similarity in signal between the pre-study 
validation in healthy subjects and pre-dose samples from study KRN23-002, which is acceptable. During 
the study, the stability of the reagents and the control samples was assessed by monitoring the results of 
control samples in each run. The stability of reagents and control samples was verified since control 
samples in each assay run met the acceptance criteria. For samples stored at or below – 20 °C, the 
stability of ADA is generally accepted so the absence of specific stability data will not be queried.  
Appropriate run acceptance criteria are defined for the method. During validation, the control samples in 
each assay run met the acceptance criteria and the CV of duplicate ECL signals was less than 30% across 
runs. The mean and standard deviation of response ratios of control LPC samples across all the assay runs 
were calculated to determine the lower limit for LPC. The lower limit for the ECL response ratio of LPC 
samples was calculated as 1.53 which is consistent with a 1% assay failure rate. The positive control 
antibody was suitably qualified.  
For study UX023T-CL201, out of 139 samples analysed, one sample had an inconclusive ADA result and 
nine samples had a result of “unknown”. Since all eight subjects involved had multiple additional ADA 
samples collected and reported, it is unlikely that these ten samples affected the subjects ADA status. 
This rationale is agreed. For study KRN23-002, all study samples contained burosumab below the drug 
tolerance threshold of the assay. The response is acceptable.  
Population PK analysis 
A population PK analysis, with pooled TIO and XLH PK data, have been used to describe PK in the TIO 
patient population. Due to the limited TIO sample size the pooled analysis approach is adequate. The final 
Assessment report

Page 31/111 
 
 
 
 
population PK model described the TIO data well and no differences were detected between the two 
patient populations. In adult subjects with TIO having a median body weight of 76 kg, CL/F and V/F of 
burosumab were projected to be 0.305 L/day and 8.03 L, respectively. Corresponding elimination t1/2 was 
projected to be ~18 days. There was no indication that baseline FGF23 affect the burosumab serum 
concentration, despite the higher baseline FGF23 values in the TIO population. Shrinkage values for V/F 
and CL/F, in the TIO population, were estimated to 9.36% and 25.0%, respectively. It is agreed that the 
values are sufficiently low to derive adequate individual PK parameters. 
Population PKPD analysis 
A pooled analysis approach was also used for the PKPD model of the relationship between serum 
phosphorus levels and the burosumab serum concentration. The final PKPD model describes the 
relationship between serum phosphorus levels and burosumab serum concentration well and is 
considered adequate. Shrinkage estimates for E0, Emax and EC50 were 44.3%, 31.8% and 7.81%, 
respectively. The shrinkage values for E0 and Emax indicate that the derived individual E0 and Emax 
parameters will be somewhat shrunk towards the population mean values. It is agreed that the due to the 
small study size greater shrinkage estimates are expected, however when interpreting the PD predictions, 
it should be kept in mind that the variability will be somewhat under predicted.  
The main difference between the two patient populations is the effect of baseline FGF23 on the response 
(covariate on both E0 and EC50) detected for the TIO population, as well as and a somewhat lower EC50 
value. Although the TIO sample size is small and covariate effects should be interpreted with caution, the 
inclusion of FGF23 as a covariate clearly improved the prediction of the phosphorus levels it the TIO 
population. Patients with FGF23 levels at baseline > 2000 pg/mL (N=3) seem to require a high dose; 
however, no trend is visible for patients with FGF23 levels at baseline < 2000 pg/mL. Thus, it is agreed 
that there is no clear relationship between baseline FGF23 levels and final dose. Subsequently there is not 
sufficient evidence to adjust the starting dose based on the baseline FGF23 value. 
Dosing simulations in adult subjects with TIO 
The final popPK and PKPD models were used to simulate burosumab and phosphorus serum 
concentrations given seven different dosing regimens. Resampling of subject’s characteristics from the 
actual TIO clinical trials, preformed based on quartiles of baseline levels of FGF23 were used.  
The simulated burosumab serum levels for 2.0 mg/kg Q2W display markedly higher exposure levels 
(median Cmax ~40000 ng/mL) than have been previously studied in the XLH population (95th percentile 
of Cmax 16882 ng/mL for 1.0 mg/kg Q4W). Furthermore, the proposed maximum total dose is 180 mg, 
compared to the previously 90 mg maximum dose for the XLH population. The MAH has clarified that the 
maximum total dose of 180 mg was not implemented in the initial PK. Thus, new simulations and 
subsequent exposure predictions have been provided. As expected, a slightly lower exposure range was 
presented. Furthermore, the exposure range given a 2.0 mg/kg Q2W dose (maximum 90 mg) in the 
adolescent XLH population was presented. Compared to the proposed dosing regimen for the adolescent 
TIO population (the only difference is the maximum dose of 90 mg vs 180 mg) the exposure range in TIO 
population is somewhat higher (as expected). The MAH has provided the requested comparison, 
nonetheless, it is not clear why it would be acceptable to have a maximum dose of 180 mg in the TIO 
population but not in the XLH population. The inconsistency between the maximum recommended dose 
between TIO and XLH adult patient populations are further addressed in the Safety section.  
The results of the PKPD simulations clearly visualize that it is the baseline FGF23 levels that are predictive 
of the response rather than the exposure levels. However, due to the limited input on demographics and 
FGF23 levels, the results of the simulations should be interpreted with caution. 
It is noted that the proposed starting dose in TIO patients (0.3 mg/kg) is lower than the recommended 
starting dose for XLH patients (1 mg/kg), which is somewhat counter-intuitive given the observed higher 
Assessment report

FGF23 levels in the TIO population. However, as several TIO patients remained on the 0.3 mg/kg dose 
level after the titration phase the starting dose can be accepted. 
Dosing simulations in paediatric subjects with TIO 
No data are available in paediatric patients with TIO. Therefore, age-extrapolated simulations using the 
popPK and PK/PD models developed for adults with TIO were conducted to select a dosing regimen for 
paediatric patients (full-extrapolation approach). 
The extrapolation is based on the assumption of similar PK and PD properties of burosumab between 
paediatric and adult patients with TIO. Similar PK and PD properties of burosumab were found between 
paediatric and adult patients with XLH. Similar PK properties of burosumab were found between adult XLH 
and TIO subjects in the population PK analysis. Due to the common pathologic cause, the applicant 
contends a high likelihood exists that the PD properties of burosumab are similar in paediatric and adult 
subjects with TIO. The extreme rareness of TIO in paediatric patients unable to undergo tumour resection 
is acknowledged, as is the difficulty in obtaining sufficient data in this population to draw firm conclusions. 
Population PK/PD modelling indicated that the exposure/response relationships across adult and 
paediatric subjects with XLH were similar; neither age nor FGF23 levels were identified as significant 
covariates. Thus, the MAH has provided an adequate discussion and justification as to why it is 
reasonable to assume that the PK/PD of burosumab would be similar in paediatric patients to that in adult 
patients with TIO. It is agreed that any differences in the PD relationship between adults and paediatrics 
is likely to be captured by the proposed weight-based posology of burosumab. Further, incremental dose 
adjustments of burosumab are proposed to normalise serum phosphate levels as needed. 
The simulations were based on the population PK and PKPD models with the model parameters for the 
TIO population, however some clarification on the simulations was sought during the procedure. A 
paediatric weight distribution was simulated based on the CDC weight distributions for 1 to 17 years of 
age. 1000 virtual patients were simulated for each age group, which is accepted. However, the 
simulations for the paediatric TIO population assumed that all patients had a baseline FGF23 value of 356 
pg/mL. The assumption of a fixed baseline FGF23 value is a major assumption since baseline FGF23 is the 
major predictor for the response. As such the simulated phosphorus levels to support the dosing regimen 
in children are of limited value. FGF23 levels varied widely in adults and the simulations were stratified 
FGF23 quartiles. To evaluate the impact of baseline FGF23 levels on the PK and E/R relationship of 
burosumab in paediatric TIO patients (aged 1-17 years), the MAH performed additional PK and PK/PD 
simulations. Given the limited information on the range of FGF23 levels in paediatric TIO patients, it is 
acceptable that the MAH based the distribution of levels observed in adult TIO patients.   
Based on the results of the simulation exercise, the selected starting dose for paediatric patients (1-17 
years) is 0.4 mg/kg Q2W. At this dose, ~85% of adolescents are predicted to achieve serum phosphate 
levels above the lower limit and 1% predicted to achieve levels above the maximum level. At the lower 
dose of 0.3 mg/kg Q2W, ~75% of adolescents are predicted to achieve phosphate levels above the lower 
limit with only 0.2% predicted to achieve levels above the maximum level. Additional simulations support 
a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg Q2W for adolescent patients (aged 13-17 years), with incremental dose 
adjustments as required. 
In the younger age groups (1-12 years), there is no predicted risk of hyperphosphataemia at 0.4 mg/kg 
Q2W, but the majority of subjects will likely need a higher dose to normalise serum phosphate. At the 
maximum tested dose of 2 mg/kg Q2W, the risk of hyperphosphataemia is negligible (0-0.1%), but the 
majority of patients will achieve normal serum phosphate levels. Although it seems that higher starting 
doses might be appropriate in children aged 1-12 years, the proposed conservative starting dose of 0.4 
mg/kg Q2W in this age group, with incremental dose adjustments as required, is accepted since it 
minimises the risk of developing hyperphosphataemia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022

The simulations suggest that for the age ranges of 1 to 12 years of age, dose levels of burosumab 
required to normalize serum phosphorous levels may increase with age. The MAH has agreed that a lower 
starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg Q2W burosumab for adolescent TIO patients (aged 13-17 years) is more 
appropriate than the previously proposed higher starting dose. 
The simulated distribution of burosumab serum concentration in the paediatric TIO population has not 
been presented. However, as the baseline FGF23 value does not affect the burosumab exposure and that 
the PK properties between TIO and XLH patients are similar, the burosumab serum concentrations are 
expected to be similar in the paediatric TIO population as in the paediatric XLH population where the 
proposed dosing regimen has been accepted.  
Overall, the dosing recommendation in the TIO population is in general similar to the dosing 
recommendation previously accepted for the XLH population, and as such the burosumab exposure is 
expected to be similar. The exception is the 2.0 mg/kg Q2W dosing strategy, with maximum dose of 180 
mg, in adults. A 2.0 mg/kg Q2W, maximum dose 90 mg, dosing regimen has previously been accepted in 
the paediatric XLH population. The PKPD modelling results indicate that increased baseline levels of 
FGF23 could require an increased dose to achieve normal phosphorus levels, which seems reasonable due 
to the increase in target levels. However, due to the small sample size of TIO patients the relationship 
between burosumab exposure and phosphorus levels for high baseline FGF23 levels as well as high dose 
levels are based on an extremely small sample and should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, the 
simulation results for the paediatric population should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, given 
careful titration of the dose based on phosphorus levels, the proposed dosing regimen is considered 
acceptable 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The burosumab pharmacokinetics and PKPD have been adequately described in the adult TIO population. 
Due to the small sample size of TIO patients the relationship between burosumab exposure and 
phosphorus levels for high baseline FGF23 levels as well as high dose levels are based on an extremely 
small sample and should be interpreted with caution. Given careful titration of the dose based on 
phosphorus levels, the dosing recommendation in adult and paediatric TIO patients is accepted.

KRN23-002 
This study was conducted at four sites in Japan and three sites in South Korea.  
The eligibility criteria in KRN23-002 were largely identical to those of Study UX023T-CL201.  
Treatments 
UX023T-CL201 
All subjects received SC burosumab treatment at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg every fourth week (Q4W). 
Doses were then titrated at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 to achieve a fasting peak serum phosphorus level 
within the target range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL (0.8 – 1.3 mmol/L). Titration was allowed to continue beyond 
the Week 16 visit if needed to achieve a dose that optimized trough serum phosphorus levels to within 
the normal range, to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q2W. 
Although the maximum dose administered to date in clinical studies in adults with XLH is 1.0 mg/kg Q4W, 
the maximum dose selected in this study is 2.0 mg/kg Q2W. This dose was selected because it is 
anticipated that doses > 1.0 mg/kg may be needed to bring serum phosphorus levels up to the lower end 
of the normal range in subjects with TIO. Compared to subjects with XLH, FGF23 levels are higher in

subjects with TIO and ENS-associated osteomalacia, and the associated hypophosphatemia is more 
severe. 
KRN23-002 
As for Study UX023T-CL201, the starting dose was 0.3 mg/kg Q4W with the same dose titration 
schedule. As opposed to Study UX023T-CL201, the maximum dose in-KRN23-002 was 2 mg/kg Q4W 
instead of 2 mg/kg Q2W.  
For subjects in Japan, self-administration of burosumab was allowable in hospital or at home at or after 
Week 48. 
Objectives 
UX023T-CL201 
The primary objectives of Study UX023T-CL201 were to establish the effect of burosumab treatment on 
increasing serum phosphorus levels in adults with TIO and to establish the change from Baseline in 
histomorphometric indices by analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies. 
The secondary efficacy objectives evaluated burosumab treatment effect on key biochemical and clinical 
disease parameters and symptoms in TIO, including markers of phosphate homeostasis and skeletal 
health, functional mobility and strength, patient-reported pain, fatigue, and health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL). 
KRN23-002 
The study objectives in Study KRN23-002 were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRN23 after its 144-
week once every 4 weeks (Q4W) repeated subcutaneous (SC) administration to Japanese and Korean 
patients with TIO or ENS.

Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included additional measures to assess serum phosphate levels over time, as well as 
the following: 
•  Change from baseline over time in serum FGF23, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 1,25- 
dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D); and urinary phosphate, tubular reabsorption of phosphate 
(TRP), TmP/GFR, and fractional excretion of phosphate. 
•  Change and percent change from baseline over time in serum biochemical markers of bone 
turnover, including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), carboxy terminal cross-linked 
telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx), procollagen type 1 N-pro-peptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin.

Primary endpoint 
•  Serum phosphate concentration at each test time point 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included additional measures to assess serum phosphate levels over time, as well as 
the following: 
• 
Percentage changes from baseline in histomorphological parameters (O.Th, OS/BS, OV/BV and 
MLt) as measured at Week 48. 
•  Changes from baseline over time in serum FGF23, ALP, and 1,25(OH)2D, and urine phosphate, 
TRP and TmP/GFR.

•  Changes from baseline over time in motor functions (HHD, STS, WAL and 6MWT). 
•  Changes from baseline over time in patient-reported outcomes (BPI, BFI and SF-36). 
Specific methodology 
Trans-iliac crest bone biopsy 
In Study UX023T-CL201, to assess osteomalacia, subjects underwent iliac crest bone biopsies at baseline 
and Week 48. In Study KRN23-002, bone biopsies were an optional procedure. 
Bone biopsy histomorphometry was interpreted centrally by trained personnel who were blinded to other 
subject data (Insogna et al. 2019). Specific histomorphometric parameters chosen to evaluate changes in 
osteomalacia with burosumab treatment include Osteoid thickness (O.Th), osteoid surface/bone surface 
(OS/BS), and osteoid volume/bone volume (OV/BV), which are static parameters providing information 
about the amount of unmineralized bone (Dempster et al. 2013). In addition, mineralization lag time 
(Mlt), a dynamic modelling parameter representing the mean time interval between the formation of 
osteoid and its subsequent mineralization (Dempster et al. 2013), was evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 38/111 
 
 
 
 
Bone biopsies were read centrally by a reader who was blinded to the timing of the biopsy relative to 
treatment. 
Mineralization defects can prevent evaluation of Mlt due to very low tetracycline label uptake in the 
biopsies; when unavailable, Mlt was calculated using an established imputation technique. In 8 subjects in 
the TIO Analysis Set, in whom Mlt was not measurable, Mlt was calculated using an established 
imputation technique (Dempster et al. 2013). 
Bone Fractures and Pseudofractures 
Fractures and pseudofractures were assessed as exploratory endpoints in both TIO studies by two 
complementary methods: whole body bone scans, using 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate, and 
standard radiographs (skeletal survey).  
The MAH has provided a Bone Scan White Paper (not included in this report for the sake of conciseness) 
which provides a comprehensive critical evaluation of the assessment of fracture healing in patients with 
TIO treated with burosumab.  
In brief summary, bone scans are highly sensitive in the detection of mineralising lesions of any size, with 
increased uptake at sites of injury and ongoing repair. Low specificity is an inbuilt methodological price of 
the high sensitivity of bone scans. Healing of a known fracture is indicated by the resolution of tracer 
uptake at a previously identified fracture site over time. As a result of the sensitivity of the method, 
complete healing as assessed by bone scan can take 2 to 3 years to show; healing can be further delayed 
in the presence of osteomalacia (Brenner et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2013; Matin 1979). 
Bone scans on treatment were compared to baseline scans by a central reader who was blinded to 
subject data 
Identification of fractures/pseudofractures on standard radiographs, x-ray, is dependent on the 
technique/angles of the images. Proper positioning of the anatomic area of interest is essential and 
impacts the ability to capture underlying pathology. Radiography is limited in the assessment of certain 
conditions such as undisplaced acute fractures or pseudofractures, which can be radiographically occult. 
Healing on radiographs is indicated by the presence of bridging at a fracture site, and complete healing as 
assessed radiographically typically occurs within 12 to 24 weeks. 
A skeletal survey was conducted at Screening, including standard radiographs of multiple predefined 
anatomic sites including both standardised sites and sites identified on body scan or clinical observations. 
Skeletal surveys were read by three central readers, blinded to subject data, without adjudication. 
Radiographs were interpreted locally for the identification of new abnormalities and assessed centrally for 
changes over time; there was no communication from central readers to local sites. Follow-up 
radiographs of fractures were performed only if the local radiologist identified a fracture. Therefore, 
systematic and consistent prospective follow-up of fractures identified centrally at baseline is not 
available. However, this is not considered to be a major deficit in the assessment of skeletal health. 
Fractures only identified at baseline through a skeletal survey (and not identified by the patients' 
physician) are likely minimally symptomatic and not interfering with mobility. A subsequent skeletal 
survey was performed at Week 144 or end of study. 
Pain, Fatigue, and HRQoL at Study Baseline 
Three patient-reported scales were used to evaluate pain, fatigue and quality of Life (HRQoL): Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and SF-36v2. The three scales have been evaluated for 
relevance in adult TIO and assessed for validity, reliability and sensitivity to change in a Patient-reported 
Outcomes Dossier for Patients with Tumour-induced Osteomalacia, provided by the MAH. 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 39/111 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were required not to have pharmacological vitamin D metabolite or an analogue, or oral 
phosphate in the 2 weeks prior to the screening visit (Week -4). The patient-reported outcomes (PRO) 
and functional performance assessments were taken on baseline Day -2. Therefore, TIO subjects were 
without treatment for approximately 6 weeks before baseline assessments. It is possible that a gap in an 
effective treatment could worsen physical performance and reported HRQL at baseline. 
The BPI is a self-reported, pain-specific questionnaire with a recall period of 24 hours. Four of the items 
in the BPI evaluate pain severity and seven evaluate the interference of pain with daily life (Figure 11). 
Mild pain is defined as a score of 1 to 4, moderate pain is defined as a score of 5 to 6, and severe pain is 
defined as a score of 7 to 10 (Serlin et al. 1995).  
Figure 11: Conceptual framework of the nine-time short-form BPI used in the phase 2 studies 
The BFI is a self-reported questionnaire consisting of nine items related to fatigue that are rated on a 0 to 
10 numerical rating scale with a recall period of 24 hours. Three items relate to the severity of fatigue 
now, usually and at its worse. A further six items relate to the interference of fatigue with daily 
functioning All nine BFI items combine together to form a global fatigue score (Figure 12). 
Figure 12: Conceptual framework of the BFI 
HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36v2 questionnaire. The 36 items of the SF-36 are grouped into eight 
domain scales, with differing numbers of contributory items, which are used to calculate Physical 
Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores (Figure 7). The recall 
period is the last 4 weeks.  
T-based scoring is used for the SF-36, standardized using the means and SD from a US general 
population (UX023-CL201) or a Japanese general population (KRN23-002). The T-based scores have a

mean of 50 and a SD of 10. All scores obtained <50 can be interpreted as below the US or Japanese 
general population T-score; scores >50 can be interpreted as above the US or Japanese general 
population score 
Figure 13: Conceptual framework for the SF-36 v2 questionnaire 
Sample size 
UX023T-CL201 
Fifteen subjects were planned to be enrolled in the study. This sample size would provide a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) with the half width no greater than 24.8%, assuming the proportion of subjects 
with a phosphorus level above the LLN at 2 weeks after dosing, as averaged across dose cycles between 
baseline and Week 24 was 60%. A reduction in excess osteoid was expected to be shown in all subjects 
with paired biopsies, with an estimated ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in osteoid thickness. The sample 
size and study duration were believed to be sufficient to enable characterization of burosumab effects on 
serum phosphorus levels, excess osteoid histomorphometric indices, and the safety profile of burosumab. 
KRN23-002 
A national questionnaire survey by the Hormone Receptor Abnormality Research Committee has shown 
that the number of patients diagnosed as having TIO in Japan was 35. 
When the number of TIO patients aged 18 years or older, the study subjects for this study, was 
investigated at 8 sites in Japan, the total number of TIO patients was calculated at 28, and 15 of such 
patients were estimated to be subjects for this study. In consideration of the feasibility of the study (e.g., 
frequency of study visits), the number of enrollable subjects was judged to be about 4. Also in Korea, a 
similar investigation was conducted at 3 sites and the number of patients as the subjects for this study 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022

was estimated to be 10 and, in consideration of the feasibility of the study, the number of enrollable 
subjects was judged to be about 2. Based on these considerations, the number of subjects enrollable in 
the present study was judged to be about 6. 
Randomisation 
Not applicable. Both studies were single-arm studies in which all subjects received investigational 
product. 
UX023T-CL201 
Subjects were to be selected for screening only if they were deemed to be inoperable for cure. A historical 
tumour image could be used as the screening image if it was obtained within 12 months of screening. 
Due to that this was the first study of KRN23 in subjects with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia, 
subjects were to be enrolled sequentially; to minimize any safety risks the first 3 subjects must complete 
at least the first 2 doses with no safety or tolerability issues before the next 12 subjects could be 
enrolled. 
KRN23-002 
The Investigators performed screening after obtaining informed consent in writing from subjects. The 
subjects who were ascertained to be eligible were enrolled into the study within 21 days after the 
screening. After enrolment, a baseline examination was conducted. KRN23 treatment was initiated 1 to 3 
days after the baseline examination, and within 35 days after the enrolment for the subjects who 
underwent bone biopsy or within 21 days after the enrolment for the subjects who did not undergo bone 
biopsy. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. Both studies were open label. 
Study KRN23-002 
The applicant considered that no observer bias could occur in the evaluation of serum phosphorous, which 
was the measurement for the primary endpoint. For the assessment of 99mTc bone scan, standard X-ray 
examination, renal ultrasound, TIO/ENS imaging, and bone biopsy, the person in charge of assessment 
was furnished solely with the relevant data, i.e., no other information concerning the relevant subject was 
provided. 
Statistical methods 
UX023T-CL201 
The submitted study UX023T-CL201 CSR summarizes efficacy and safety analyses through Week 144 for 
subjects with TIO (N = 14) and includes all planned analyses for all enrolled subjects (N = 17). 
Analyses of the data were to be performed when the first 3 subjects had completed their Week 12 visit. 
An additional analysis was to occur using all available data when the first subject had completed the post-
treatment bone biopsy and could occur at other time points.  
The protocol-defined statistical analyses were detailed in the statistical analysis plan (version 1.0, dated 
04 May 2016) before the analyses for this report were conducted. The Statistical Analysis Plan, Version 
1.0, has been submitted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 42/111 
 
 
 
 
Statistical analyses have been reported using summary tables, figures, and data listings. Where 
applicable statistical tests were 2-sided at an alpha = 0.05 significance level and 2-sided 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) have been presented. All p-values are presented as nominal p-values. There was no 
adjustment made for multiplicity. 
Analysis sets 
Full Analysis Set: All efficacy (except bone biopsy endpoints), safety, and PK/PD analyses will be 
performed on the set of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. 
Biopsy Analysis Set: The biopsy analysis set will include enrolled subjects with Baseline and follow-up 
(either Week 48 or ET prior to Week 48) bone biopsy data. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The proportion of subjects who achieved a serum phosphorus level above the LLN (2.5 mg/dL [0.81 
mmol/L]), at 2 weeks after dosing (between baseline and Week 24, on average) was provided, along with 
the 2-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method. Additional analyses of serum 
phosphorus including observed values, change from Baseline, percent change from Baseline over time, 
and area under the curve were summarized from Baseline to Week 24.  
For Histomorphometric indices O.Th, OS/BS, OV/BV and MLt at baseline, Week 48, both change from 
baseline, and percent change from baseline at Week 48 were summarized. Change from baseline at Week 
48 will be tested using a t-test if the normality assumption is valid. If the normal assumption is invalid, a 
sign test will be used.  
Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data 
For all analyses, missing data was treated as missing, unless otherwise specified. When a change from 
baseline was assessed, only subjects with a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement was 
included in the analysis 
Missing Data in Bone Biopsy Parameter MLt 
If the MLt data was missing due to low quality of the bone biopsy sample (i.e. no bone biopsy parameters 
are available for that sample), the MLt parameter was to be set to missing for the sample. If the MLt data 
was missing due to very little label uptake because of the mineralization defect (i.e. there is at least one 
bone biopsy parameter available for that sample), the MLt was to be imputed as O.Th/(MAR*MS/OS), 
where MAR was imputed as 0.3 μm/day, with O.Th, MS and OS from the same visit of the same subject 
(Dempster et al. 2013). If any of O.Th, MS or OS at that visit for the subject was missing, MLt was to be 
set as missing. 
Secondary endpoints 
Summaries have been provided. 
Interim Analyses 
Administrative analyses were performed to support regulatory activities or product development per the 
Sponsor’s decision. The primary analysis was conducted when subjects completed the Week 48 
assessments. 
Data Monitoring Committee 
Based on the open-label study design, safety will be monitored by Ultragenyx. An independent data 
monitoring committee will not be used.

KRN23-002 
In the CSR it is stated that no changes were made to the planned statistical analysis provided in the 
protocol. No amendments were made to the SAP and PAP, which were finalized prior to interim database 
lock. The SAP provided is version 1.0 dated 12 April 2018. The statistical analysis plan was created based 
on the protocol version J2.0.M. The SAP identified a single instance of a change in the planned analysis: 
“The achievement number and proportion of mean phosphorus in secondary endpoints will be calculated 
except in the case that the data obtained at all evaluation time points are missing”.  
No changes following interim database lock were made. As post-hoc analyses, other adverse events of 
special interest were analysed.  
Analysis sets 
The “efficacy analysis set” included all eligible subjects who had received at least one dose of KRN23 and 
had serum phosphorus concentration data after KRN23 treatment initiation. 
The “safety analysis set” included all eligible subjects who had received at least one dose of KRN23. 
The “pharmacokinetic analysis set” included all eligible subjects who had received at least one dose of 
KRN23 and in whom blood had been collected for serum KRN23 concentration measurement after KRN23 
treatment initiation. 
Primary Endpoint 
Descriptive statistics of serum phosphorus concentration at each test time point were calculated and a 
summary of serum phosphorus concentration over time have been presented in a table. In addition, 
mean serum phosphorus concentration values over time have been plotted in a graph with the week on 
the X axis, and the mean values on the Y axis. 
Secondary Endpoints 
Descriptive statistics of changes and percentages change from baseline of the following 
histomorphological parameters, as measured at Week 48, were to be calculated including osteoid 
Thickness (O.Th), osteoid surface/Bone surface (OS/BS), osteoid volume/Bone volume (OV/BV) and 
mineralization lag time (MLt) 
Descriptive statistics of the changes from baseline of serum levels of FGF23, ALP, and 1,25(OH)2D and 
urinary levels of phosphorus, TRP, and TmP/GFR were to be calculated. In addition, mean values and 
mean changes from baseline were to be plotted with the week on the X axis, and the mean values and 
mean change from baseline on the Y axis. 
Descriptive statistics of the changes and percent changes from baseline of serum bone biomarkers (CTx, 
P1NP, BALP, and OC) were to be calculated. 
Multiple Comparison/Multiplicity 
Multiplicity was not considered. 
Interim Analyses and Data Monitoring 
Data cut-off will be performed at the time all the subjects (excluding those who withdrew from KRN23 
treatment) have completed the examination at Week 24, and at the time after completion of Week 48 
examination.

Results  
Participant flow 
UX023T-CL201 
Seventeen subjects enrolled in the study, of which 14 subjects had TIO and 1 subject had ENS-associated 
osteomalacia. Two subjects who were enrolled in the study with a clinical diagnosis of TIO were later 
found to have XLH based on genetic testing. A total of ten TIO-subjects have reached Week 144 at the 
data lock point for this report (Figure 14).

a  All enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of burosumab. 
b  Excludes 2 subjects with XLH  and I subject with ENS-associated osteomalacia. 
c  All enrolled subjects in the corresponding analysis set with baseline and Week 48 bone biopsy data. 
d  Excludes 1 subject who received minimal burosumab dosing on study. 
e  Two subjects were found to be positive for PHEX mutations during the study, and were therefore discontinued prior 
to Week 144. 
f  One subject had not completed the Week 144 visit as of the data cutoff date (11 Jan 2019). 
The following five subjects discontinued the study as of the data cut-off date: 
•  One subject (TIO) died due to a serious TEAE (considered not related to burosumab by the 
Investigator). 
•  One subject (TIO) discontinued burosumab treatment due to serious TEAE, and was subsequently 
discontinued from the study due to lack of phosphorus increase in response to burosumab (the 
highest burosumab dose that the subject had received during the study was 1.4 mg/kg). 
•  One subject (TIO) was discontinued from the study per the Sponsor’s decision, that was also 
supported by the Investigator, as the subject’s serum phosphorus levels were mostly in the 
normal range throughout the study and therefore, the subject received minimal burosumab 
dosing during the study (a total of 4 doses up to Week 72, ranging from 0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg).

The subject disposition is summarised in Table 14. 
Table 14: Subject Disposition (KRN23-002)  
The following subjects discontinued the study as of the data cut-off date: 
•  One subject received four doses of burosumab treatment over 12 weeks before discontinuing 
from the study. The dose was titrated up to 1.0 mg/kg at Week 12. There were no post-dose key 
efficacy response data or tumour data as the subjects only received four doses. 
•  One subject was removed before the start of KRN23 administration because of withdrawal by 
subject 
As of the cut-off date, 4 subjects had self-administered KRN23 in hospital. Two subjects had self-
administered KRN23 at home.

Changes to the Conduct of the Study 
The original protocol was dated 29 August 2014. There were five protocol amendments. 
Amendment 1 was dated 21 January 2015, i.e. before the start of the study.  
Amendment 2 was dated 14 October 2015. This amendment included an increase of sample size from 
approximately 6 to approximately 15 adult subjects. Also, sections of the protocol was updated to specify 
the co-primary efficacy evaluations (i.e., change from baseline in serum phosphorus levels over time and 
percent change from baseline in osteomalacia parameters at 48 weeks as determined by 
histomorphometric evaluation of trans-iliac crest bone biopsies). 
Amendment 3 was dated 17 February 2016. This amendment included an extension of the study 
duration: After completion of the 48-week treatment period, subjects could continue treatment for up to 
an additional 96 weeks in the Treatment Extension Period. 
Amendment 4 was dated 10 November 2017. Treatment duration was extended to 216 weeks or until 
30 June 2019. The maximum volume of a burosumab injection was increased from 1.0 to 1.5 mL. The 
wording of the co-primary endpoint regarding histomorphometry assessments was updated from percent 
change from baseline to change from baseline in excess osteoid based on analysis of iliac crest bone 
biopsies after 48 weeks of KRN23 treatment using the following histomorphometric indices: O.Th, OS/BS, 
OV/BV, and MLt. 
Amendment 5 (dated 27 April 2018) was implemented at the clinical sites after 10 January 2018, the 
data cut-off date for the application of this variation. The amendments included introducing a mutational 
analysis of the PHEX gene to rule out a possible XLH diagnosis due to the similar clinical features of the 
diseases in specific subjects who had clinical symptoms and hypophosphatemia since childhood and in 
whom the tumour had not been identified. 
Protocol deviations 
During the study, a total of 5 subjects (35.7%) in the TIO Analysis Set had at least one major protocol 
deviation (n=8). 
Four subjects had a major deviation regarding the timing of signing an updated ICF. One subject had a 
major protocol deviation under the category of “Procedure Not Done”, that included not having a urine 
pregnancy test performed at Screening and subsequent visits because of uncertainty about the subject’s 
menopausal status. Three subjects had a major protocol deviation under the category “other”. 
As discussed above, two subjects were tested and found to be positive for PHEX mutations and were 
diagnosed with XLH. These 2 subjects were also considered to have major protocol deviations in the 
category “other” and excluded from the TIO Analysis Set.

In Study UX023T-CL201, the tumour location and type had been determined prior to the study for 10 of 
the 14 subjects with TIO (71.4%) in Study UX023T-CL201 (Figure 15). For one of these 10 subjects, the 
underlying tumour was identified for the first time at Screening. Tumours had never been located in 4/14 
subjects (28.6%), and TIO was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and biochemical evidence.

The decrease in the median dose at Weeks 96 and 144 can be explained by the discontinuation of one 
subject who was receiving doses > 1 mg/kg, dose reduction in one subject following an event of 
hyperphosphatemia, and dose reduction in one subject following tumour resection.

PD endpoints across TIO studies 
The proportion of subjects achieving mean serum phosphorus levels > 2.5 mg/dl at the mid-point of the 
dosing cycle was a Co-primary endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201 and Serum phosphate concentration at 
each test time point was the primary endpoint in Study KRN23-002.

Table 21: Summary of PD Endpoints in Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 
A total of seven (50%) subjects (95% CI: 26.8, 73.2) in the TIO Analysis Set achieved a mean serum 
phosphate level above the LLN as averaged across the midpoint of the dose intervals (i.e., 2 weeks after 
dosing) between baseline and Week 24 (Co-primary endpoint). 
In Study UX023T-CL201, two subjects did not have increases in serum phosphate to above the LLN with 
burosumab treatment. Both subjects had very high FGF23 levels at baseline: 
One subject discontinued burosumab treatment due to a serious TEAE at Week 24. The subject was 
subsequently discontinued from the study at Week 36 due to lack of phosphate increase in response to 
burosumab (the highest burosumab dose that the subject had received during the study was 1.4 mg/kg) 
and due to the Investigator’s referral to chemotherapy treatment. 
One subject experienced two serious TEAEs on study that were considered unrelated to burosumab 
treatment and were consistent with the subject’s medical history of continued progression of the 
underlying tumour; doses were increased to a maximum of 2 mg/kg Q2W. No serum phosphate data are 
available after the Week 144 dose; no hyperphosphataemia or other safety findings potentially related to 
burosumab were noted with the Q2W dosing. 
In Study KRN23-002, three subjects failed either to achieve serum phosphorous levels above LLN or to 
maintain an increase in terms of and expectation of burosumab efficacy in a TIO patient population: 
•  One subject: serum phosphorous remained below LLN through to Week 88 
•  One subject: serum phosphorous remained below LLN until early termination at Week 14 
•  One subject: serum phosphorous achieved normal levels on only 2 occasions through to Week 88

Histomorphometric Indices of Osteomalacia  
The change from Baseline in excess osteoid based on analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies after 48 weeks 
of KRN23 treatment using histomorphometric indices OV/BV, OS/BS, O.TH and Mlt was a co-primary 
endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201. 
Of the 14 subjects with TIO in Study UX023T-CL201, 11 subjects had paired bone biopsies at Baseline 
and Week 48 and comprised the TIO Biopsy Analysis Set.  
Most subjects in the TIO Biopsy Analysis set (9/11; 82%) presented with osteomalacia (qualitatively 
graded as mild [three subjects] and severe [six subjects]) as demonstrated by an excess of osteoid tissue 
(assessed by osteoid volume, surface, and thickness) and delay in Mlt (time from osteoid deposition to 
mineralisation). Two subjects (18%) did not have osteomalacia at baseline based on the qualitative 
assessment, although Mlt was prolonged in these subjects, and bone formation activity was low as 
evidenced by minimal or absent tetracycline label. 
All subjects had previously been treated with oral phosphate/active vitamin D, and most subjects with 
severe osteomalacia (five of six [83%]) had received SoC treatment for >5 years.  
In eight subjects in the TIO Analysis Set, in whom Mlt was not measurable, Mlt was calculated using an 
established imputation technique (Dempster et al. 2013). 
The histomorphometric data from Study UX023T-CL201 are summarised in Table 22 
Assessment report

Page 55/111 
 
 
 
 
Table 22: Histomorphometry Results and Reference Ranges – Study UX023T-CL201 (TIO Analysis Set) 
Two subjects were qualitatively evaluated as having no osteomalacia at baseline based on normal osteoid 
volume, despite having prolonged Mlt. In both subjects, bone formation activity was extremely low, as 
demonstrated by the absence of/minimal tetracycline double label. After 48 weeks of burosumab 
treatment, bone formation improved in both subjects, as shown by an increase in mineralisation surface, 
indicating improved mineralisation and improved bone formation. While the osteoid volume per bone 
volume increased in both subjects, this change is likely due to increased bone turnover at Week 48

compared with baseline, and the fact that mineralisation had improved on burosumab but had not yet 
completely normalised. 
Comparisons were made between the TIO Biopsy Analysis Set of Study UX023T-CL201 and the adult XLH 
bone biopsy study UX023-CL304.  
Table 23: Osteomalacia Parameters at Baseline and Week 48 in TIO UX023T-CL201 and XLH UX023-
CL304 Studies 
In Study KRN23-002, bone biopsies were an optional procedure, and therefore limited data are available 
on osteomalacia at baseline in this study population. Three subjects underwent bone biopsies at baseline, 
and all three subjects had severe osteomalacia, despite treatment with long-term therapy with oral 
phosphate/active vitamin D (Table 24).

Bone Fractures and Pseudofractures 
In Study UX023T-CL201 total of 249 nontraumatic active fractures and pseudofractures were detected on 
99mTC- labelled whole body bone scan conducted at baseline, indicative of the underlying osteomalacia 
and poor bone quality at study entry. Bone scans on treatment were compared to baseline scans by a 
central reader who was blinded to subject data  
The number of new fractures/pseudofractures detected via bone scan decreased over time, from 19 and 
17 new active fractures/pseudofractures identified at Weeks 24 and 48, respectively, to three new active 
fractures each and no new pseudofractures identified at Weeks 96 and 144 (Table 25). Of note, all three 
new active fractures identified at Week 144 were in one subject who did not show an optimal response 
with burosumab treatment, possibly due to a very high tumour burden and FGF23 levels.

he graded them as healed. Therefore, the true number of new fractures/pseudofractures identified by this reader is 
10. 
In study KRN23-002, at baseline, 142 active fractures and 21 active pseudofractures were identified by 
bone scan (Table 27).

Functional Mobility Tests 
Sit-to-stand- (STS) test: The STS-test measures lower extremity strength and mobility as a subject 
moves repeatedly from one position to another.   
At baseline, 11 of the 14 subjects in the TIO Analysis Set completed the STS test; one subject did not 
perform the test at baseline because it was not part of the original protocol, one subject was unable to 
stand during the test due to lower extremity neuropathy, and testing was contraindicated in one subject 
due to injury/illness. Results for both studies are presented in Table 28.

6-Minute Walk (6MWT) Test: The 6MWT is frequently used to assess mobility. In Study UX023T-CL201, 
the 6MWT was performed for six of 14 subjects at baseline and eight of 14 subjects at Week 48. The low 
number of subjects was mainly due to inclusion of the 6MWT in the protocol in relation to the timing of 
the subjects’ baseline visits. In Study KRN23-002, the 6MWT was performed for all 13 subjects at 
baseline and 12 of 13 subjects at Week 48.

For comparison, for STS, a mean of 15 repetitions/30 sec was reported for 30 healthy controls (age 20–
74 years) (Agarwal et al. 2006; Jones et al. 1999). For 6MWT, the mean (SD) distance walked at baseline 
was less than half of the predicted distance based on age and gender matched normative controls.

Changes from baseline at Week 48 in histomorphometric indices osteoid 
thickness (O.Th), osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS), osteoid volume/bone 
volume (OV/BV) and mineralisation lag time (MLt)) were tested using a t-test if 
the normality assumption was valid. In this case, the null hypothesis tested was 
that mean change from baseline to Week 48 is 0. If the normal assumption was 
invalid, a sign test was used. In this case, the null hypothesis tested was that the 
median change from baseline to Week 48 is 0. 
Treatment groups  All subjects received subcutaneous (SC) burosumab treatment Q4W.  
All subjects received SC burosumab treatment at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg. 
Doses were then titrated at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 to achieve a fasting peak 
serum phosphorus level within the target range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL. Titration was 
allowed to continue beyond the Week 16 visit if needed to achieve a dose that 
optimized trough serum phosphorus levels to within the normal range, to a 
maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q2W.

baseline and percent change from baseline on histomorphometric indices O.Th, 
OS/BS, OV/BV and MLt at Week 48  were tested using a t-test if the normality 
assumption was valid. If the normal assumption was invalid, a sign test was used. 
Statistical tests were 2-sided at the alpha = 0.05 significance level and 2-sided 
95% CIs were used. 
MLt is considered of less value compared to the other bone biopsy markers as 
most values are imputed.

Notes 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies. 
The efficacy of burosumab in adults with Tumour Induced Osteomalacia (TIO) was evaluated in two small, 
open-label Phase 2 studies (UX023T-CL201 in the USA and KRN23-002 in Japan and Korea). No clinical 
studies were performed in paediatric subjects with TIO.  
In total, not more than 27 subjects were enrolled in the two studies in the application to extend the 
indication for Crysvita to include treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced 
osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or 
localised, in patients aged 1 year and over. The sample size is very limited, based on the rareness of the 
condition. Further, there is a substantial heterogenicity among subjects with TIO. Differences in disease 
severity and duration, levels of FGF-23, dosing, and compliance with oral phosphate/active vitamin D 
treatment prior to study entry contribute to this heterogenicity. This is likely have contributed to the 
complexity of the study results.  
The data cut-off for the initial submission was January 2019 for UX023T-CL201 and May 2018 for KRN23-
002, corresponding to data from Week 144 and Week 88, respectively. Upon request, the MAH has 
presented data up to End of Study (EoS) for both studies. Study UX023T-CL201 collected data to Week 
300; however, only one patient completed treatment of this duration. Study KRN23-002 collected data up 
to Week 216 (n=2). Data beyond Week 240 (n=7) for study UX023T-CL201 and beyond Week 184 (n=5) 
for KRN23-002 cannot be considered robust.

According to the provided Subject disposition for study UX023T-CL201, in total six subjects discontinued 
the study. However, the MAH notes that although study UX023T-CL201 collected efficacy data to Week 
300, only one patient completed treatment of this duration, indicating that seven subjects discontinued 
study treatment but stayed in the study. A similar pattern could be suspected in study KRN23-002, as 
data from only three subjects are presented towards the end of the study. 
It is considered of some concern that only 4/27 subjects seem to adhere to treatment until the end of the 
studies. Upon request, the MAH has clarified that this was in large part due to that per study protocol, the 
study duration differed depending on whether subjects transitioned off the study to receive commercial 
burosumab treatment when it became available in their territory. For the remaining subjects 
discontinuing the study, it is agreed with the MAH that the vast majority could be considered unrelated to 
treatment.  
Posology 
In the posology for the TIO indication in adults, the MAH proposed the same starting dose as used in the 
studies, i.e., 0.3 mg/kg Q4W, and a maintenance dose up to 2 mg/kg Q4W (maximum absolute dose per 
administration 180 mg) or even 2 mg/kg Q2W.  
The approved starting dose for adult subjects with XLH is 1 mg/kg. No maximum weight-based dose in 
adults with XLH is provided in the SmPC; however, the maximum dose per administration is 90 mg, 
restricting the dose to approximately 1.3 mg/kg in a subject weighing 70 kg. The higher proposed 
maximum dose for TIO subjects is based on the argumentation that the serum concentration of FGF-23 is 
typically higher in subjects with TIO than with XLH, which may warrant a higher dose of burosumab. This 
is in line with the baseline FGF-23 levels in studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 compared to the 
pivotal study in adult XLH subjects. In total, in UX023T-CL201, seven subjects (50%) were administered 
doses over 100 mg, i.e., above the maximum approved dose per administration in adult XLH subjects (90 
mg). This may support that a higher dose than the maximum approved dose in the adult XLH population 
may be needed in some subjects with TIO-induced hypophosphataemia.  
Despite the relatively high maximum doses allowed in the studies, the actual dosing was quite 
conservative. The mean burosumab dose at all time points in both studies was below the recommended 
starting dose for adults with XLH. In Study KRN23-002, no subject was given a higher dose than 1.8 
mg/kg and no subject was administered 180 mg on any occasion. In Study UX023T-CL201, only one 
subject used the maximum dose (2 mg/kg); however, another subject also reached the maximum 
absolute dose of 180 mg. For one subject (the subject given the 2 mg/kg dose), the option to administer 
burosumab Q2W was used.  
Three subjects in the TIO-population did not reach LLN for serum phosphate. One subject was given the 
maximum allowed study dose, 2 mg/kg Q2W and reaching the maximum absolute dose, 180 mg per 
administration, whereas the other two subjects did not receive maximal treatment. Of note, these three 
subjects had unusually high baseline FGF-23. One subject had the highest baseline level of FGF-23 across 
the TIO studies. One subject had the highest baseline level of FGF-23 in Study UX023T-CL201 whereas 
one subject reported an elevated level at baseline (well above the study mean of 770 pg/mL). This may 
explain the (partial) lack of response in these subjects. 
The lower starting dose in the TIO studies compared to the approved starting dose in adults with XLH is 
related to the studies being launched before the approval of Crysvita in adults. It could be argued that a 
lower starting dose compared to the adult XLH population is somewhat contradictory given the 
assumption that a higher maintenance dose may be needed in the TIO population. However, over 20% of 
the subjects in both studies were given ≤0.3 mg/kg burosumab at each time point, indicating that this 
dose may be sufficient in some subjects. 
The somewhat conservative dosing in the TIO-population is considered prudent and in line with the 
recommendation in section 4.4 of the approved SmPC, that the serum phosphate levels with burosumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 70/111 
 
 
 
 
treatment should be targeted in the lower part of the normal range to avoid events of 
hyperphosphataemia.  
As Study KRN23-002 proceeded, more patients needed to receive the higher doses of burosumab to 
maintain serum phosphorous above LLN. No neutralising ADAs, which could otherwise be an explanation 
to lack of efficacy over time, have been reported in either of the TIO studies. The MAH argues that it is 
feasible that at least some subjects experienced tumour progression with accompanying increased levels 
of FGF23 as the study continued. This is accepted.  
The relative maximum dose 2mg/kg Q2W is approved in the paediatric XLH population up to the age of 
18 years. Notwithstanding, according to the proposed SmPC, the maximum dose per administration in the 
adult TIO population is substantially higher compared to the currently approved maximum dose in adult 
XLH subjects, i.e., 180 mg Q2W compared to 90 mg Q4W. Few patients has nevertheless been exposed 
to these high levels. This is further discussed in the safety section.  
The clinical studies enrolled only adult subjects. The dosing regimen for this paediatric population was 
evaluated by modelling and simulation that extrapolated adult population PK and PK/PD models to 
paediatric age groups. It is reasonable to assume that the PK/PD of burosumab would be similar in 
paediatric patients to that in adult patients with TIO, and that any potential differences in the PD 
relationship between adults and paediatrics is likely to be captured by the proposed weight-based 
posology of burosumab. The proposed starting dose in the paediatric population is 0.4 mg/kg for subjects 
≤12 years of age and 0.3 mg/kg for subjects >12 years of age compared to 0.8 mg/kg in the paediatric 
XLH population (1-17 years), whereas the maximum dose in paediatric subjects with TIO is identical to 
the maximum dose in the approved paediatric XLH population, 2 mg/kg Q2W, but not more than 90 mg 
per administration. Similar to the proposed starting dose in adult TIO patients, the starting dose in 
paediatric TIO patients is lower compared to XLH dosing recommendation.  
Given careful titration of the dose based on phosphorus levels, the dosing recommendation in adult and 
paediatric TIO patients could be accepted (please refer also to the safety section). 
Study design 
Overall study design 
Both studies were open-label and single-armed. The studies were not designed to show efficacy against 
standard of care for the condition. The lack of comparator is considered a major weakness with the TIO 
development program. Daily oral treatment with Vitamin D and/or phosphate is considered standard of 
care (SoC) for TIO when surgery is not feasible and was also used by in principle all participants before 
inclusion in the studies. No relevant comparison between burosumab and SoC can be made with the 
current study design. 
It is not agreed with the MAH that a randomised, controlled study in the TIO population would not have 
been feasible. It is agreed that a blinded, placebo-controlled design would have been challenging; 
nevertheless, a randomised controlled study using delayed design, i.e., with half of the subjects 
randomised to receive burosumab from baseline and the other half to start with SoC for a 3-6-months 
before transition to burosumab, could have been considered. As both studies are now concluded, this is 
not further pursued.  
The MAH argues that the lack of control group could be compensated by the vast majority of subjects 
being treated with Vitamin D and/or phosphate before entering the study. This is not agreed. Per the 
study protocols, active treatment with oral phosphate substitution and active Vitamin D should be 
withdrawn at least two weeks prior to the screening visit. As such previous treatment was not an 
eligibility criterion for the studies, no earliest time for withdrawal of conventional therapy was identified. 
In Study UX023T-CL201, subjects were without oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy for at least 6 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 71/111 
 
 
 
 
weeks, and in Study KRN23-002, subjects were without oral phosphate and vitamin D treatment for at 
least 8 weeks. However, actual screening periods varied for each subject. 
Oral phosphate is normally given 3-5 times daily, as serum phosphate is rapidly regulated in the body, 
precluding that serum phosphate levels would be sustained several weeks or months after withdrawal of 
conventional therapy.  
The MAH has provided a summary of the last regular serum phosphate measurement before entering the 
study for comparison to study measurements (for details, please refer to Response to Question 23). Data 
is difficult to interpret as regular measurements were only available for in total 17 subjects (UX023T-
CL201: n=8; KRN23-002: n=9), the time between the last regular serum phosphate measurement and 
the baseline measurements varied greatly, and, at least in study UX023T-CL201, this time was generally 
several months long. Furthermore, only one pre-withdrawal phosphate measurement was available for 
each subject. Nevertheless, a numerical decrease in mean serum phosphate was seen between last 
regular measurement and baseline, from 2.2 mg/dL to 1.8 mg/dL in UX023T-CL201 and from 2.3 mg/dL 
to 1.6 mg/dL in KRN23-002 for the same 17 subjects, in support of the view that baseline measurements 
could not be considered on treatment. 
As the phosphate co-primary analysis in study UX023T-CL201 was not a comparison to baseline 
phosphate levels, this is not considered to impact the primary endpoint. For KRN23-002, the primary 
endpoint was “Serum phosphorus concentrations at each test timepoint”; however, only descriptive 
statistics were applied. The MAH has presented updated graphs in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Notwithstanding, many TIO patients have limited effect of active Vitamin D and/or oral phosphate. 
Furthermore, as pointed out above, conventional treatment is administered as multiple daily doses, 
associated with high non-compliance in both adults and children that compromise their overall tolerability 
long term. Treatment is often associated with potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria and 
secondary hyperparathyroidism. The beneficial effect of burosumab on phosphate homeostasis in the TIO 
population is therefore considered of clinical relevance also in the absence of a comparator and a positive 
treatment effect compared to baseline may still form a support for the applied indication.  
One subject underwent tumour resection during the first 24 weeks of Study UX023T-CL201. After 
surgery, serum phosphate temporarily increased from 1.3 mg/dL to 3.0 mg/dL, but his average serum 
phosphate level remained below the lower limit of normal at Week 24 with unchanged dose of 
burosumab. The subject was a non-responder at Week 24 and tumour surgery in this single subject is 
therefore not considered to have affected the primary endpoint.  
Eligibility criteria 
The eligibility criteria restrict inclusion to subjects with TIO-associated osteomalacia that was not 
amenable to cure by surgical excision of the underlying tumour/lesion, either due to the location of the 
tumour or inability to locate the lesion. This reflects the condition described in the MAH’s proposed 
amendment to the wording in SmPC section 4.1. 
Study UX023T-CL201 enrolled subjects from the US, whereas Study KRN23-002 enrolled subjects from 
Japan and South Korea. To address the concern whether the results from the studies are applicable to the 
European population, the MAH provided a comparison across two recently published case series from 
China and Italy, showing that the clinical presentation of the patients from these two diverse ethnicities 
was almost identical. It is therefore unlikely that there is any clinically meaningful difference in disease 
presentation between the study populations and the European population. 
Endpoints 
The proportion of subjects achieving mean serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal (LLN; 
2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]) at the mid-point of the dose interval (2 weeks after dosing), as averaged 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 72/111 
 
 
 
 
across dose cycles between Baseline and Week 24 was a co-primary endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201. 
This endpoint was identical to the primary endpoint in Study UX023-CL303, the pivotal study in adults 
with XLH, assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G.  
The primary endpoint in Study KRN23-002 was serum phosphate concentration at each test time point. 
The primary endpoint was entirely descriptive. Serum phosphate concentration averaged across the 
midpoint of dose cycles and over the endpoint of dose cycles (Weeks 0 – 24) were secondary endpoints in 
UX023T-Cl201. In both studies, serum phosphate peaks (i.e., midpoint of the dose interval, 2 weeks 
post-dose) and troughs (i.e., endpoint of the dose interval, 4 weeks post-dose) were assessed up to 
Week 22, after which only troughs were assessed. 
In procedure EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G, it was considered that the strong correlation between serum 
phosphorus levels and the symptomatology in XLH justified the use of this pharmacodynamic surrogate 
marker as primary efficacy endpoint. As the pathophysiology in XLH and TIO both involve elevated levels 
of FGF-23 with subsequent hypophosphataemia, this endpoint could be considered adequate also for 
evaluation of burosumab in TIO. 
Osteomalacia, characterised by softening of bone tissue due to defective mineralisation of osteoid 
demonstrated by excessive osteoid thickness, volume, and surface, is a main feature of TIO. 
Osteomalacia may be associated with symptoms as body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility of the 
bones. The change from Baseline in excess osteoid based on analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies after 48 
weeks of burosumab treatment using the histomorphometric indices osteoid volume/bone volume 
(OV/BV), osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS), osteoid thickness (O.Th) and mineralisation lag time 
(Mlt) was the second co-primary endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201. Upon request, the MAH has clarified 
that there is no minimal change from baseline that could be considered clinically relevant. Instead, the 
reduction in excess osteoid becomes clinically relevant through the subsequent improvements in bone 
and joint pain, fractures, stiffness and physical function. 
Although the excess osteoid endpoint consists of 4 indices, each was analysed independently. The 
classification of “co-primary” in the context of MAA is interpreted as if all five must achieve some pre-
specified statistical and/or clinical criteria. As no pre-specified statistical criteria were defined, statistical 
inference that fully controls the type I error is problematic. In their reply, the MAH discussed, hence in 
retrospect, what could have been a suitable approach to control the type I error. This is however a post-
hoc construction. Study UX023T-CL201 had five co-primary endpoints and only if the study was to have 
been viewed as successful only if all five were successful in some sense, no multiplicity consideration had 
been necessary, at least not for the primary endpoints and the criticism regarding lack of a pre-defined 
study success criterion may not have emerged.  
Fractures/pseudofractures were assessed by two complementary methods (whole body bone scans, using 
99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate, and standard radiographs [skeletal survey]). To reduce the risk 
of bias, initial lesions locally identified by bone scan or skeletal surveys at baseline were followed by 
central readers (one for bone scans, three for skeletal surveys) blinded to subject data.  
Bone fractures and pseudofractures were assessed as exploratory objectives only. However, the clinical 
relevance of these findings is easier to interpret than bone histology. Moreover, fracture data is 
considered less susceptible than serum phosphate measurements to the gap in treatment after 
terminating standard of care before screening. Therefore, this data could potentially support the proposed 
new indication.  
As previously pointed out, the risk of bias is considered substantial if the radiographs with the reader 
knowing that a certain set of radiographs represented before and after treatment in the same subject. 
Upon request, the MAH has undertaken a re-read of all available images (bone scans and X-rays) by an 
independent reading centre. Images were assessed without reference to baseline images and were 
provided to the reader in a random order. The reader was tasked with assessing each bone scan and X-
ray to identify the presence of fractures or pseudofractures.

Three patient-reported scales were used to evaluate pain, fatigue and quality of Life (HRQoL): Brief Pain 
Inventory (BPI), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) and SF-36v2. The three scales have been evaluated for 
relevance in adult TIO and assessed for validity, reliability and sensitivity to change in a Patient-reported 
Outcomes Dossier for Patients with Tumour-induced Osteomalacia provided by the MAH. In this 
evaluation, it was concluded that the PRO instruments were supported as secondary endpoints in the 
Phase 2 trials of burosumab in TIO. However, due to the sample size, it was recommended that the 
results should generally be considered exploratory. P-values provided by the MAH are therefore not taken 
into consideration.  
The MAH points out that TIO subjects were without treatment for approximately 6 weeks before baseline 
assessments. It is possible that withdrawal of an effective treatment could worsen physical performance 
and reported HRQL at baseline. Moreover, the open-label design does not account for expectation effects 
in these subjective PRO measures, and it is difficult to estimate a true effect of a drug itself. The MAH 
addressed this by comparing BPI and BFI data from subjects treated with placebo in XLH Study UX023-
CL303 (available from baseline to Week 24) with corresponding data from subjects enrolled in TIO Study 
UX023T-CL201. This is considered a rational approach; however, only two post-baseline observations 
were available for comparison for the XLH placebo population and an impact of the open label design on 
the PRO data could not be ruled out. Therefore, data should be interpreted with caution.  
Statistical analysis 
The open label nature of both studies without an adequate control in a small number of patients where a 
priori statistical criteria of success had not been clearly defined in the presence of potential confounding 
were, and still are, major deficiencies that limits interpretation of the primary and secondary endpoints 
efficacy results. The resulting inferences from the provided study data can only be considered as 
preliminary and not confirmatory. This conclusion has not changed albeit will not be further pursued.  
While it is acknowledged that this is a rare condition, the internal validity of the trial is questionable, and 
an inadequately planned design and analysis cannot substitute a well-planned analysis (and trial design). 
The logical consequence for this is that without knowing the extent of the type I error associated with a 
conclusion that the experimental treatment may confer benefit, the Applicant has failed to quantify the 
chance of that of an erroneous that may affect future patients who may be given the experimental 
intervention.  
The Applicant has justified the TIO study design including prior statistical criteria and type I error control. 
For none of the studies was there a prospective discussion on a minimum required level of efficacy for the 
study to be interpreted as successful. In their reply, the MAH mainly reiterated the non-justified 
assumptions made what regards study UX023T-CL201 sample size and underlined that the study KRN23-
002 sample size was ultimately decided based on enrolment feasibility. This could be understood in the 
context of that each study was planned in the setting of being the first in the current patient population, 
and in that the analyses were to provide descriptive summaries that, taken together, rather witness of 
proof-of-concept and hypothesis generation. The MAH invokes the rare patient population and the highly 
heterogeneous clinical presentation. This is acknowledged, but unfortunately, offers no reassurance but 
rather underlines the importance of pre-defined, substantiated, and justified hypotheses. The deficiency 
pertaining to lack of pre-defined success criteria is by default rather futile to address in retrospect. 
Further, the MAH clarified that study UX023T-CL201 analyses were conducted without any consideration 
concerning multiplicity and discuss, hence in retrospect, what could have been a suitable approach to 
control the type I error. Although the now proposed method, a stepwise procedure combined with 
Bonferroni, is per se acceptable this is a post-hoc construction. The MAH claims that by using the 
proposed method, the conclusions from the analysis of co-primary efficacy endpoints do not change. It 
appears however that it could be questioned that the confidence interval for osteoid thickness would not 
contain 0 if the method of Bonferroni was actually to be applied. Irrespective of which, with the outcomes 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 74/111 
 
 
 
 
already at hand, any attempt to justify a non-predefined approach for type I error control owns little (if 
anything) of value. 
Regarding potential confounding the MAH’s reply was initially far from adequate, and the applicant was 
requested, for both studies (KRN23-002 and UX023T-CL201), to again address the impact of confounding 
on the observed results, in particular the primary and secondary outcome. The MAH has now provided 
some evidence of the impact of covariates/potential confounders on outcomes. The analyses do not 
provide an equivalent estimate of a treatment effect in the context of comparative evidence due to the 
limitation of the design, being a single arm trial. Consequently, the matter is partially resolved, but not 
pursued further as definitive evidence of an unbiased effect as a consequence of confounding would be 
very difficult to derive. However, the main evidence is not foremost based on the two submitted single 
arm TIO trials but mainly relies on that it is possible to extrapolate to earlier XLH studies. 
To compare the burosumab treatment effect across XLH and TIO, the MAH conducted propensity score 
matched analyses using study UX023T-CL201 and adult XLH Study UX023-CL303. However, a 
justification for assumptions around propensity score modelling has not been adequately provided 
(propensity score modelling requires a non-zero probability of patients receiving the new (experimental) 
treatment). Moreover, in this specific case, such analyses are not considered to add any information on 
the effect of burosumab on serum phosphate levels. Therefore, no close attention is paid to the 
propensity score modelling. 
Study analyses were initially to provide descriptive summaries and given the absence of a concurrent 
control group; they pertain to baseline comparisons. In outcome summaries, subjects with missing data 
were excluded. This is considered an additional source of potential bias and an intent-to-treat approach 
had been preferred. Given that it was only one or two subjects with missing data up to week 24/48 and 
that outcomes are interpreted in a descriptive fashion, this was not further pursued. For study KRN23-
002, a plot depicting individual phosphorus values over time had been presented and given the limited 
data sets, this was considered illustrative, and a corresponding figure was requested also for study 
UX023-CL201. Although individual values are not that easy to follow, fluctuations are evident. Over time, 
the majority appears to lie above the lower limit of normal (2.5 mg/dL) but then there are not that many 
subjects that contribute with data. This is not further pursued.  
Study conduct 
The date of first signed informed consent for Study UX023T-CL201 was 24 March 2015 and the SAP 
version 1.0 was dated 04 May 2016. From the summaries of the five amendments provided by the MAH, 
it seems as there have been alterations to the co-primary endpoints after study start (Amendment 2 
dated 14 October 2015, Amendment 4 dated 10 November 2017). The MAH has clarified that at the time 
of the second amendment, only two subjects were included in the study, one with 4 weeks of dosing and 
one with 24 weeks of dosing. A sensitivity analysis excluding data from these two patients confirmed that 
there was no impact on the results from this amendment.  
Based on the ongoing XLH bone biopsy study UX023-CL304, Amendment 4 from November 2017 
introduced absolute change from baseline in histomorphometry measurements in place of a relative, 
percent change from baseline as analysis of the co-primary bone histology endpoint. Both the absolute 
change from baseline and the percent change from baseline are presented in Table 2. Alterations to a 
primary endpoint in the end of an open label study is questionable, as this may compromise the integrity 
of the study. Notwithstanding, the study is already concluded, and this could not be addressed in 
retrospect. 
According to the Study UX023T-CL201 SAP, administrative analyses were to be performed to support 
e.g., product development per the Sponsor’s decision. The seemingly relaxed view when it comes to 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 75/111 
 
 
 
 
performing interim analyses and present outcomes was considered to add to concerns regarding study 
integrity albeit was not pursued. 
Further, a rare disease may alone not necessarily justify a very limited sample size and initially the 
sample size in each study was foremost understood to pertain to the phase 2 context. However, it can be 
agreed with the MAH that the rareness of the condition hampers recruitment. As an example, almost one 
third (9/28) of all Japanese subjects with TIO aged >18 years were included in Study KRN-002. Taken 
this into consideration, the difficulty to increase the sample size is acknowledged. Originally study 
UX023T-CL201 was planned as a single centre study and was to include approximately 6 subjects. With 
amendment 1 this became a multi-centre study and with amendment 2, after the study had started, the 
sample size was increased to approximately 15 adult subjects. In the end, a total of 17 subjects were 
enrolled, (see further below). For study KRN23-002 the sample size was decided based on feasibility. In 
the end, 14 subjects, all with TIO, were enrolled to be compared with expected six. 
Two of the subjects enrolled in Study UX023T-CL201 were later (after Week 48) found to have XLH. 
These subjects are not included in the TIO analysis set. Genetic testing for the PHEX mutation was 
introduced late in study UX023T-CL201, which explains why the two subjects with XLH were not identified 
earlier. XLH is a genetic disorder with complete penetrance and clinical signs of the disease normally 
develop in early childhood. Severity varies between individuals, but it is not likely from the 
pathophysiology of the disease that an asymptomatic subject with XLH would suddenly develop severe 
symptoms in adult age. Genetic testing for PHEX mutations only in patients, whose symptoms of 
hypophosphatemia began in childhood and whose tumour could not be located, is considered adequate to 
exclude patients with XLH. According to the MAH, all subjects in both studies fulfilling these criteria were 
tested without identification of additional subjects with XLH. 
After removal of the subjects with ENS and XLH, the TIO Analysis Set in Study UX023T-CL201 consists of 
14 subjects. Three of these subjects discontinued the study before Week 144: One subject experienced a 
fatal event, one subject discontinued burosumab treatment due to serious TEAE and was subsequently 
discontinued from the study due to lack of phosphorus increase in response to burosumab pursue 
chemotherapy treatment of the underlying tumour and one subject was discontinued from the study by 
the Sponsor/Investigator due to low burosumab dose with intermittent administration. 
No screening phosphate level was provided for this subject; however, the day before the first dose, 
serum phosphate was above the upper level for inclusion in the study (2.5 mg/dL). It is highly 
questionable whether this subject should have been included in the study, given that serum phosphate 
the day before first treatment was within the normal range. 
It is not considered accurate for the Investigator/sponsor to actively remove subjects from the statistical 
analyses during the study, especially not in a single arm, open label study. Notwithstanding, data from all 
14 TIO subjects seem to have been included in the Week 24 analyses. The issue is therefore not further 
pursued. 
Fourteen subjects enrolled in Study KRN23-002, all with TIO. One of the subjects withdraw consent 
before exposure to burosumab. No further information about this subject was provided. The subject was 
not included in the safety or efficacy analysis sets, which therefore include 13 subjects.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy was evaluated in the UX023T-CL201 TIO analysis set (N=14) and the KRN23-002 Efficacy 
analysis set (N=13). Except for country of origin and weight, the study populations in the two studies 
were similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 76/111 
 
 
 
 
Results from the two studies were not pooled; however, integrated analyses were performed based on 
pooled efficacy data available through Week 88 from the two studies. It is agreed with the MAH that the 
similarity in study design, study population and endpoint allow for an integrated analysis. 
Direct comparisons to the efficacy in adult XLH studies are hampered by differences in study populations, 
study design and underlying disease. However, to get an estimation on the effect size in the TIO 
development program, results from the adult XLH development program, in particular from the pivotal 
study UX023-CL303 and the adult bone biopsy study UX023-CL303, are sometimes included in the 
following discussion. The adult XLH-studies were assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G. 
Phosphate endpoints 
In both TIO studies, mean baseline serum phosphate was 1.6 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L).  
A total of 50% (95% CI: 26.8, 73.2) of the subjects in the TIO analysis set had achieved Mean Serum 
Phosphorus Levels > 2.5 mg/dL, i.e., over the lower limit of normal (LLN), as averaged across the mid-
point of the dose intervals (i.e., 2 weeks after dosing) between Baseline and Week 24 (Co-primary 
endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201). In comparison, 94% of the burosumab treated population in the adult 
XLH-study UX023-CL303 achieved this endpoint. 
In Studies UX023T-CL201 and Study KRN23-002, serum phosphate averaged across the midpoint of dose 
cycles was 2.64 and 2.63 mg/dL (0.85 and 0.85 mmol/L) respectively, for Week 0-24, compared to 3.24 
mg/dL (1.05 mmol/L) in UX023-CL303.  
As discussed elsewhere, the actual dosing show that most subjects in UX023T-CL201 and KRN-002 were 
given doses well below the allowed maximum dosing in the studies, indicating that dosing in the TIO 
population was conservative. This, together with a difference in baseline serum phosphate levels between 
the studies (1.6 mg/dL [0.5 mmol/L] in UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 versus 2.0 mg/dL [0.65mmol/L] 
in UX023-CL303) is considered to at least in part explain the differences in outcome between the two 
populations. As data indicate that the 0.3 mg/kg starting dose is sufficient for some patients, both in the 
clinical studies and the post-marketing data from the US and Japan, the conservative starting dose is 
considered prudent and in line with the recommendations to avoid hyperphosphataemia.  
The beneficial effect of burosumab was sustained throughout the studies. In study UX023T-CL201, serum 
phosphate had increased from 1.60 mg/dL at baseline to 2.56 mg/dL at Week 144. The corresponding 
value at Week 240 (n=7) was 2.57 mg/dL. In KRN23-002, baseline serum phosphate was 1.62 at 
baseline, 2.72 at Week 88 and 2.70 mg/dL at Week 176 (n=8). No statistical analyses after Week 144/88 
were performed. 
In summary, it is agreed with the MAH that burosumab treatment resulted in an increase in serum 
phosphate compared to the baseline level; however, somewhat more modest when compared the adult 
XLH population, which, at least in part may be a question of dosing. This increase is considered to be of 
clinical relevance and may offer a support for the applied indication. 
Bone biopsy histomorphometry 
The change from Baseline in excess osteoid based on analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies after 48 weeks 
of burosumab treatment using the histomorphometric indices osteoid volume/bone volume (OV/BV), 
osteoid surface/bone surface (OS/BS), osteoid thickness (O.Th) and mineralisation lag time (Mlt) was the 
second co-primary endpoint in Study UX023T-CL201. A similar endpoint was used in the adult XLH bone 
biopsy study UX023-CL304, with interim data assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/004275/II/0010/G. In 
general, osteomalacia was more pronounced in Study UX023-CL304.  
In Study UX023T-CL201, there was a numerical improvement compared to baseline in OV/BV (-5.5 
[-11.9, +0.9] %; p=0.086) and O.Th (-5.1 [-10, -0.2] um; p=0.048). The percent change from baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 77/111 
 
 
 
 
for OV/BV was 31% and for O.Th 32%. The corresponding percent change from baseline in the XLH 
population was 54% and 33%, for OV/BV and O.Th, respectively. However, unlike UX023-CL304, no 
improvement was seen in OS/BS in study UX023T-CL201 (-0.2 [-14, +14] %, p=0.98) (-26% 
and -0.004% change from baseline for UX023-CL304 and UX023T-CL201, respectively; p=0.98 for 
UX023T-CL201).  
In a subgroup analysis, the Week 48 results for the six subjects with severe osteomalacia in the TIO 
Biopsy Analysis Set were more similar to the XLH population in UX023-CL304, including a positive effect 
on OS/BS (-11.0%; p=0.248). It is also noted that osteomalacia seems have been more pronounced in 
Study UX023-CL304 based on baseline OS/BS and O.Th. As there was a trend towards a better effect on 
OS/BS in the post hoc analysis in subjects with severe osteomalacia at baseline in UX023T-CL201, the 
difference in treatment effect on OS/BS between the studies could in part be explained by a difference in 
the degree of baseline osteomalacia 
Mineralisation lag time (Mlt) was readable at both baseline and Week 48 for only three subjects in 
UX023T-CL201. For the remaining eight subjects, Mlt data was imputed. No conclusions are considered 
possible. 
Bone biopsy data from study KRN23-002 is considered less robust as data is available for three subjects 
only and there was large variation in baseline data. 
Fracture data 
An increasing proportion of healed/partially healed fractures/pseudofractures was seen with time with 
bone scan in both studies. This could however reflect the natural course of a fracture. As there is no 
comparator group, no conclusions could be drawn on whether burosumab shortens the time of fracture 
healing. 
As detailed under Methods above, the MAH has undertaken a re-read of fracture data. The number of 
fractures is low, resulting in small and sometimes contradictory results when comparing the effect of 
burosumab on single fracture locations between the studies and between the modalities. Notwithstanding, 
there was, as in the original reads, a consistent decrease in the total number of fractures and 
pseudofractures after initiation of burosumab in both studies and with both modalities also in the re-read 
A reduction in both the number of patients reporting symptomatic fractures as adverse events and in the 
number of fractures reported in UX023T-CL201 was seen after initiation of burosumab treatment. Taken 
together, numerically, from the blinded re-reads, there seems to be a decrease in fractures with initiation 
of burosumab treatment offering a support to the proposed indication. 
Mobility data 
Mobility was evaluated by the sit-to stand test STS) and 6-minute walking test (6MWT) which were 
secondary endpoints in both TIO studies. In 6MWT the mean (SD) walking distance increased from 309 
(210) m at baseline to 331 (175) m (p=0.12) in UX023T-CL201 and from 296 (96) to 354 (116) in 
KRN23-002. No formal statistical analysis for 6MWT and STS was done in KRN23-002. 
For STS the number of repetitions increased from 6.7 (4.0) to 7.7 (4.5) (p= 0.0012) in UX023T-CL201 
and from 9.9 (4.5) to 14.1 (4.0) in KRN23-002.  
Taken together, the mobility data offers some support to the proposed indication. 
Patient-reported Outcomes 
In Study UX023T-CL201, numerical reductions were observed over time with burosumab treatment 
across all Brief pain inventory (BPI) domains. At Week 48, LS mean reductions of -0.9, -0.85 and -1.04 
points on a scale from 0-10 were seen for Worst pain, Pain severity and Pain interference, respectively. 
The improvements did not reach the conservatively estimated level for clinical relevance at the group 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 78/111 
 
 
 
 
level of approximately 1.4 for each of these BPI scales. The results were similar to the corresponding 
reductions seen in the burosumab arm of the adult XLH study UX023-CL303 (-1.3 for Worst pain and -1 
for Pain interference; Pain severity not calculated). Baseline BPI parameters were higher in the XLH 
compared to the TIO study.  
Numerical reductions were observed over time with burosumab treatment also across all Brief fatigue 
inventory (BFI) domains. At Week 48, LS mean reductions of -0.84, -1.31, -1.85 and -1.64 were seen for 
Worst fatigue, Fatigue severity, Fatigue interference and Global fatigue, respectively. The improvement in 
Global fatigue was numerically larger in UX023T-CL201 compared to UX023-CL303 (-1.64 and -0.5, 
respectively), with similar baseline values. A change score of approximately 1.5 was considered as 
meaningful at the group level for each of the BFI scores, indicting a stronger treatment effect on BFI 
versus BPI.  
Decreases in pain and fatigue domains also were observed in Study KRN23-002, except for pain 
interference; however, in this study, the results are more inconsistent, possibly due to large inter-
individual variations.  
In both studies, increases from baseline in mean scores were noted across all physical health domains of 
the SF-36v2 instrument, predominantly in the physical domains. No meaningful effect was seen in Mental 
health in any of the studies or Mental component score in UX023T-CL201 (not calculated for KRN23-002). 
The SF-36v2 instrument was not used in UX023-CL303.  
In summary, there was a general trend towards an improvement of patent reported outcomes, in 
particular in the BFI score and in the Physical health domains of SF-36v2. Notwithstanding, patient-
reported symptoms are considered to be of limited value in open label studies. Furthermore, the subjects 
had been off conventional treatment with active Vitamin D and/or oral phosphate for several weeks at 
baseline. This may have worsened physical performance and thereby the reported HRQL at baseline, 
which in turn may raise expectations of resumed treatment. The patient-reported outcomes, albeit in 
support for the proposed indication, needs to be interpreted with caution.  
Of note, from exit interviews in the studies and from post-marketing experience, testimonies of 
improvements on Quality of life have emerged. These are to consider as case reports; however, could be 
considered additional support for a subjective and clinically relevant benefit of burosumab in at least 
some subjects with TIO.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
There is a Paediatric Investigation Plan waiver in place that was granted on the grounds that significant 
therapeutic benefit cannot be demonstrated in the paediatric population due to the lack of feasibility of 
conducting paediatric trials due to the extreme rarity of the TIO condition in paediatrics. However, rare 
cases of non-resectable tumours do exist also in the paediatric population. The MAH therefore proposes to 
include children above the age of 1 year in the indication. In this context, it is noted that burosumab is 
already authorised in this indication in the US from in patients aged from 2 years.  
The MAH has clarified that the US indication for treatment in the TIO population from two years of age as 
opposed to the indication from the age of one year sought in Europe is due to a request from the FDA due 
to a lack of data in children under the age of three. Finally, the MAH comments that there are extensive 
safety data available from the XLH population from 1 year and cite this as support of safety in this age 
cohort while acknowledging the differing pathologies of XLH and TIO. This argumentation is accepted.  
Burosumab is indicated in children with XLH from the age of one year. Given the mechanistic relationship 
with XLH, the safety profile from children and adolescents with XLH is considered possible to extrapolate 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 79/111 
 
 
 
 
to the paediatric TIO population. There are also no indications from the very limited safety data base, 
that any specific safety issues should apply to the adult TIO population compared to the XLH population. 
The dosing regimen for this paediatric population is discussed under subheading “dosing” above.  
2.4.3.  Summary of clinical efficacy 
In total, not more than 27 subjects were enrolled in the two studies in the application to extend the 
indication for Crysvita to include treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced 
osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or 
localised, in patients aged 1 year and over. It is reasonable to assume that the PK/PD of burosumab 
would be similar in paediatric patients to that in adult patients with TIO, and that any potential 
differences in the PD relationship between adults and paediatrics is likely to be captured by the proposed 
weight-based posology of burosumab. 
The negative consequences of longstanding hypophosphataemia on skeletal health and quality of life are 
well known. TIO associated hypophosphatemia results in many structural and metabolic consequences 
that contribute to a complex array of symptoms, especially stiffness and pain, as well as poor 
mineralisation with subsequent fractures/pseudofractures which together cause a decrease in physical 
function and mobility, leading to substantially impaired overall health.  
In total, 50% of the subjects in UX023T-CL201 and 69% in KRN023-002 reached the endpoint of 
achieving mean serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal at the mid-point of the dose 
interval. The two TIO-studies also showed an increase in serum phosphate compared to the baseline level 
which was sustained throughout the study. This increase is considered to be of clinical relevance and 
could be considered a support for the applied indication. Numerical improvement of bone mineralisation 
was seen both on bone biopsies and biochemical markers of bone remodelling. The number of new 
fractures/pseudofractures decreased over time in Study UX023T-CL201. This is also considered clinically 
relevant and may be seen as support for a new indication Furthermore, the mobility data as assessed by 
the 6-minute walking test and the sit-to-stand test offers some support to the proposed indication.  
On the other hand, there are several limitations in study design and study conduct. Such limitations 
include lack of a prospective discussion on a minimum required level of efficacy for the study to be 
interpreted as successful and absence of a suitable control arm, and study UX023T-CL201 analyses were 
conducted without any consideration concerning multiplicity. PRO data are considered less robust in an 
open label setting and for some analyses, data from very few subjects was available and the magnitude 
of improvement is partly modest.  
With this said, the difficulties to conduct scientific studies in an ultra-rare disease as TIO, with 
approximately 500 known cases worldwide, are acknowledged. Differences in disease severity and 
duration, levels of FGF-23, dosing and compliance with oral phosphate/active vitamin D treatment prior to 
study entry are additional obstacles which likely have contributed to the complexity of the study results. 
In this context, the positive trends and numerical improvements in fracture data, bone mineralisation and 
Quality of life, albeit not fully robust, could be considered supportive of a beneficial effect of burosumab 
on subjects with TIO associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively 
resected or localised. The clinical benefit is further supported by case reports from the literature and 
individual testimonies from study subjects reporting considerable improvements in signs and symptoms 
of TIO since beginning treatment with burosumab. 
In addition, although the underlying causes of TIO, and XLH are unique, both conditions are characterised 
by elevated FGF23, resulting in excessive renal phosphate wasting by impaired phosphate reabsorption, 
reduced vitamin D synthesis, and chronic hypophosphataemia. Effects of similar magnitude on serum 
Assessment report

Page 80/111 
 
 
 
 
phosphate with burosumab treatment have been reported for both conditions, taking a more conservative 
starting dosing in the TIO study population into consideration. There are no indications that normalisation 
of serum phosphate would not lead to similar beneficial effect on e.g. bone mineralisation and quality of 
life in the TIO population as in the XLH population. The same limitations apply for TIO subjects with 
longstanding hypophosphataemia as for XLH subjects started on burosumab in adult age. In the light of 
the same and very specific pathogenetic mechanism in both conditions, extrapolation of efficacy results 
from the XLH studies in combination with the (less robust) results from the TIO study, is considered to 
support to the extended indication to FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia 
associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or localised, in 
children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years and in adults”. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considers that, despite the well-recognised study limitations and the small data set, the totality 
of evidence is sufficient to support an extension of indication for Crysvita to include the treatment of 
FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic 
mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or localised in in children and adolescents aged 
1 to 17 years and in adults. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The adult safety database for the approved indication XLH comprises of 176 subjects having received at 
least one dose of burosumab in studies KRN23-INT-001/KRN23-INT-002, UX023-CL203, UX023-CL303 
and UX023-CL304.  
96-100% of the subjects in the five studies were reported with a treatment emergent adverse event 
(TEAE), of which 55-64% were deemed as related to burosumab.  
The rates of reported TEAEs were comparable in both treatment arms during the placebo-controlled 
period of the open label placebo-controlled study UX023-CL303 (94% in the burosumab arm and 92% in 
the placebo arm), whereas somewhat more TEAEs were deemed as treatment related in the burosumab 
arm (44% vs 39%). 
In the adult XLH safety database, TEAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs Infections and 
infestations (68%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (64%), Nervous system disorders 
(49%), General disorders and administration site conditions (48%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (46%). 
With some exceptions described below, the frequency of reported TEAEs in each SOC was balanced 
between the two treatment arms of study UX023-CL303. TEAEs more common in the burosumab arm 
included back pain (14% vs 6% for burosumab and placebo, respectively), Tooth abscess (13% vs 8%), 
restless legs (RLS; 12% vs 8%), Vitamin D decreased (12% vs 5%), dizziness (10% vs 6%), constipation 
(9% vs 0%), and “investigations” (21% vs 14%). Two subjects (3%) in each treatment arm were 
reported with an SAE. No SAE was deemed as related to the study drug in UX023-CL303. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for Crysvita is Injection site reactions (IRS), Hypersensitivity, 
Hyperphosphataemia, Ectopic mineralisation, Restless legs (RLS) and Anti-burosumab antibodies (ADA).

Adverse Events Related to Treatment 
In total, 14 subjects (51.9%) had TEAEs that were assessed as related to burosumab by the investigator. 
The majority of related TEAEs were only reported in one subject across both studies. Related TEAEs that

were reported for at least two subjects across studies included injection site reaction, 
hyperphosphataemia, vitamin D deficiency and rash. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Fatal events 
One (7.1%) death due to cardiac arrest was reported in Study UX023T-CL201 at the Week 144 data cut-
off. This event was assessed by the investigator and Sponsor as unrelated to study drug. 
After the Week 144 data cut-off, another subject in Study UX023T-CL201 died from events of ovarian 
cancer and multi-organ failure, which were considered by the investigator and Sponsor as unrelated to 
burosumab. 
Serious adverse events 
Serious TEAEs were reported for seven subjects (50%) in Study UX023T-CL201, and four subjects 
(30.8%) in Study KRN23-002 (Table 36), none were assessed by the investigator and Sponsor as related 
to burosumab treatment.

Table 37: Overall Summary of Predefined Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Monitored in Studies 
UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 
The total exposure-adjusted event incidence of Injection site reactions was 0.82 events/year across both 
studies compared to 0.80 events/year in the adult XLH studies.  
The total exposure-adjusted event incidence of Hypersensitivity was 1.206 events/year across both 
studies. Six subjects (22%) reported at least one hypersensitivity reaction (Eczema [3], Rash [3], 
Application site rash [1], Drug eruption [1], hypersensitivity [1]). The event of application site rash in 
Study UX023T-CL201 was considered related to topical antimicrobial wash by Investigator. There were no 
serious hypersensitivity TEAEs in any subject. Across all repeat-dose adult XLH studies, 55 
hypersensitivity TEAEs were reported for 33 (18.8%) subjects. 
There were two Hyperphosphataemia events reported for two subjects (14.3%) in Study UX023T-CL201 
and no hyperphosphataemia events reported in Study KRN23-002, with a total exposure-adjusted event 
incidence of 0.417 events/year across both studies affecting 7.4% of the TIO population. In the adult XLH 
population, eight subjects (4.5%) reported hyperphosphataemia.  
•  One subject had one event of hyperphosphataemia (serum phosphate: 5.9 mg/dL; 1.9 mmol/L) 
on Study Day 16. Of note, the subject received 0.3 mg/kg of burosumab at baseline when the 
subject’s serum phosphate level was within the normal range (3.0 mg/dL).  
•  Once subject received radiation therapy over a 5-week period, commencing approximately at 
Week 36. The subject developed hyperphosphataemia at approximately Week 68, which was 
thought to be the result of decreased tumour burden and lower FGF23 levels following radiation. 
Treatment was resumed at Week 76 at a lower dose. The subject had no further incidences of 
hyperphosphataemia. 
There were three Ectopic mineralisation events reported for three subjects. The total exposure-adjusted 
event incidence was 0.438 events/year. Of the three subjects, the events were confounded in two 
subjects. One of these subjects, who experienced calculus bladder, had a previous history of kidney 
stones, and one subject, who experienced nephrolithiasis, presented with non-obstructive nephrolithiasis 
on CT at baseline. 
Renal ultrasounds were used to assess shifts in nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. All subjects in Study 
UX023T-CL201 and nine subjects (69.2%) in Study KRN23-003 entered the studies with a baseline 
nephrocalcinosis score of 0 (Table 38).

Table 38: Shifts in Renal Ultrasound Nephrocalcinosis Scale in Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 
In the pivotal adult XLH study UX023-CL303, 16% of the subjects in the burosumab arm and 18% of the 
subjects in the placebo arm reported a shift +1 Grade in nephrocalcinosis.  
All but one subject across both studies entered the study without nephrolithiasis (Table 39). 
Table 39: Shifts in Renal Ultrasound Nephrolithiasis in Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 
In the adult XLH study, overall, there was no apparent difference between the treatment groups in 
nephrolithiasis findings by renal ultrasound. 
There were three Restless legs (RLS) events (two events of RLS and one event of sensory disturbance) 
reported for two subjects (14.3%) in Study UX023T-CL201 and no RLS events reported in Study KRN23-
002, with a total exposure-adjusted event incidence of 0.769 events/year across both studies. RLS was 
reported in 24 (13.6%) subjects in repeat-dose adult XLH studies. 
Other Adverse events of interest 
Renal Safety 
A renal safety analysis was conducted to address concerns for potential antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity and its potential impact on kidneys in the context of elevated serum FGF23 concentrations 
with burosumab treatment. 
There was one event of acute kidney injury in each study; both events were severe (Grade 3), assessed 
by the investigator as unrelated to burosumab, and resolved. One subject with a history of hypertension, 
hypercalcemia, and kidney stones, experienced creatinine renal clearance decrease and renal impairment,

both of which were mild (Grade 1), assessed by the investigator as unrelated to burosumab, and were 
resolving and resolved, respectively. One subject experienced blood creatinine increase, which was mild 
(Grade 1) and not resolved as of the data cut-off date, assessed by the investigator as unrelated to 
burosumab. 
Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps) 
A total of nine subjects (64.3%) in Study UX023T-CL201 had 20 TEAEs that were classified under the 
MedDRA SOC “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts and polyps).” (Table 40) 
Seven events were serious TEAEs occurring in six subjects. None of the events were considered related to 
burosumab by the investigator.  
Table 40: Summary of TEAEs Under MedDRA SOC “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps)” (TIO Analysis Set UX023T-CL201) 
In Study KRN23-002, one subject (7.7%) had one nonserious TEAE of skin papilloma (Grade 2/moderate 
severity) reported under the MedDRA SOC ‘Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and 
polyps)’. This event was considered by the investigator as unrelated to treatment with burosumab (no 
action taken with the study drug), and was resolving as of the data cut-off date. 
Adverse Drug Reactions Section of the Proposed Labelling 
Criteria used for defining ADRs included the frequency of the TEAE (≥10% or ≥3 subjects) in the pooled 
data for Study UX023T-CL201 up to Week 144 and Study KRN23-002 up to Week 112. Pooled TEAEs 
occurring in < 10% of subjects and < 3 subjects were also reviewed for potentially important ADRs. 
There were no new ADRs identified in the TIO population that are not already ADRs in either the adult or 
paediatric XLH population.  
The adverse drug reactions proposed to be amended to section 4.8 as a separate table for the TIO 
population are summarised below (Table 41).

Laboratory findings 
Serum Intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH)  
Most subjects entered the studies with high iPTH levels at baseline. On average, these values decreased 
to closer to the reference range of iPTH. There were no TEAEs related to iPTH levels. 
Serum Calcium  
There was an overall mean increase of 0.76 and 0.72 mg/dL at Weeks 120 and 132, respectively, in 
Study UX023T-CL201 with a maximum value of 12.1 mg/dL at both timepoints. These increases were 
largely driven by a subject with tertiary hyperparathyroidism and a subject with hypoparathyroidism 
managed by calcium supplements. 
One subject with ongoing history of hypercalcemia and tertiary hyperparathyroidism had 3 TEAEs of 
hypercalcemia, which were considered unrelated to burosumab treatment by the investigator). Another 
subject with a history of hypocalcaemia had a TEAE of blood calcium increased of moderate (Grade 2) 
severity, which was considered unrelated to burosumab by the investigator. 
Serum Vitamin D 
Levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25 (OH)2D) generally increased above baseline during both studies 
as expected with burosumab treatment (Table 25). Levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) overall 
increased slightly in Study UX023T-CL201 and decreased slightly in Study KRN23-002. 
Serum Amylase  
All but one subject entered the studies with a baseline serum amylase Grade 0. Of these subjects, one 
subject shifted to Grade 1, 2 subjects to Grade 2, and 1 subject to Grade 4 at maximum Grade post-
baseline. One subject entered Study UX023T-CL201 at a baseline Grade 2 and had a maximum post-
baseline shift to Grade 3. 
Three subjects in Study UX023T-CL201 had TEAEs of amylase increased, all of which were mild (Grade 1) 
in severity and were determined by the investigator as unrelated to burosumab. One TEAE of amylase 
increased occurred in the context of the serious TEAE of pancreatitis.

Other Serum Chemistry 
Bicarbonate levels generally increased slightly in Study KRN23-002 (but remained within the normal 
range) but showed no overall change in Study UX023T-CL201. There were no consistent or clinically 
meaningful changes in any other serum chemistry parameter. 
Serum Creatinine 
There were no clinically meaningful changes over time in mean serum creatinine concentrations in either 
study. 
One subject in Study UX023T-CL201 had 3 TEAEs related to creatinine metabolism: increased creatinine, 
decreased creatinine clearance, and elevated creatinine. All of the events were mild (Grade 1) and 
determined by the investigator to be unrelated to burosumab. Another subject in Study UX023T-CL201 
had a TEAE of elevated creatinine, which was mild (Grade 1) in severity and determined by the 
investigator to be unrelated to burosumab. 
Haematology 
No clinically meaningful changes in haematology parameters were observed in either study. 
There was one TEAE of leukocytosis in Study UX023T-CL201, which was mild (Grade 1) in severity and 
determined by the investigator to be unrelated to burosumab. 
Vital signs 
Blood pressure 
No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs were noted during either study.  
There was one TEAE of systolic blood pressure increase in Study UX023T-CL201, which was mild in 
severity and determined by the investigator to be unrelated to burosumab. There were three events of 
hypertension in two subjects in Study UX023T-CL201, all were determined by the investigator to be 
unrelated to burosumab. Subject 156-103 had one mild (Grade 1) and one moderate (Grade 2) event, 
both resolved. Subject 193-101 had a mild (Grade 1) event, which was not resolved as of the data cut-
off. There was one event of hypertension in Study KRN23-002, which was moderate (Grade 2), 
determined by the investigator to be unrelated to burosumab. 
Electrocardiograms 
Overall, no clinically meaningful changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were noted in either 
study. 
Shifts in ECG corrected QT interval Fridericia are summarised in table 42

Table 42: Shifts in Electrocardiogram QTcF Interval in Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 
Echocardiogram (ECHO) 
Two subjects in KRN23-002 had abnormal ECHO findings at baseline.  
There was one TEAE of abnormal echocardiogram (mild aortic valve thickening resulting in ectopic 
mineralisation score) in Study UX023T-CL201, which was mild (Grade 1) in severity and determined by 
the investigator to be unrelated to burosumab.  
In Study UX023T-CL201, ectopic mineralisation was also assessed using ECHO. At Baseline, 8 subjects 
(57.1%) had ectopic mineralization Grade 0, and 6 subjects (42.9%) had ectopic mineralization Grade 1. 
Minimal changes in ECHO grades were seen with burosumab treatment over time. At Week 144, 2 
subjects shifted from Grade 0 to Grade 1, and 1 subject shifted from Grade 1 to Grade 0. 
Anti-drug Antibodies 
Across both studies, all subjects tested negative for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at baseline. Two subjects 
(14.3%) in Study UX023T-CL201 were positive for ADAs at Week 120 and were subsequently negative at 
Week 144. Both subjects tested negative for neutralising antibodies at Week 120. One of these subjects 
had four ISR TEAEs during the study; however, the ISRs did not coincide with the time point of the 
positive ADA test. The other subject (193-101) had no ISR or hypersensitivity TEAEs. The remaining 12 
subjects (85.7%) tested negative for ADAs at all post-baseline time points tested.  
In Study KRN23-002, all subjects tested negative for ADAs at all post-baseline assessments. No subject 
tested positive for neutralising antibodies in either study. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: Safety data in subjects > 65 years old (N=9) did not show any meaningful differences from the 
overall study population.  
Sex: Review of safety data by sex revealed no meaningful differences  
Race:  There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety observed between Study UX023T-CL201, 
which included a majority of white subjects, and Study KRN23-002, which included all Asian subjects, 
suggesting no difference in the safety profile between these two groups. 
Renal and Hepatic Impairment: Renal impairment can induce abnormal mineral metabolism which may 
increase phosphate concentrations greater than expected with burosumab alone. This can lead to 
increased risk of hyperphosphataemia and nephrocalcinosis. Subjects with severe kidney impairment 
were excluded from Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002, as they could be prone to increases in serum

phosphate and calcium. Burosumab treatment is also contraindicated in XLH patients with severe renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease. Renal safety in subjects with XLH is being monitored in a long-
term disease monitoring programme, Study UX023-CL401. 
Subjects with a history of liver impairment were not excluded from burosumab clinical trials. Medical 
history at baseline was reviewed, and only 1 subject had a history of acute hepatitis. There were no 
TEAEs related to hepatic impairment in this subject. Four subjects had TEAEs in the Hepatobiliary 
Disorders SOC, none of which were considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Paediatric population: Whilst no clinical data exists in paediatric patients with TIO, given the evidence 
from the use of burosumab in the treatment of adults and children with XLH and the comparable PD effect 
of blocking excess FGF23 in adults and children, the safety profile and pharmacological effect of 
burosumab in paediatric patients with TIO would be expected to be comparable to the adult TIO 
population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been conducted with burosumab in subjects with TIO. 
Concomitant use of burosumab with oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D analogues is contraindicated 
as this combination increases phosphate concentrations greater than expected with burosumab alone. 
This increase may result in hyperphosphataemia which can induce nephrocalcinosis. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One serious TEAE (neoplasm progression) in Study UX023T-CL201 led to study treatment discontinuation. 
The event was a Grade 3 and was assessed by the investigator and Sponsor as unrelated to burosumab 
treatment. Up to the ISS data cut-offs (11 Jan 2020 for Study UX023T-CL201 and Week 112 visit for 
Study KRN23-002), no other TEAEs had resulted in treatment discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
Burosumab is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of XLH in children and adolescents aged 1 to 
17 years with radiographic evidence of bone disease, and in adults. Burosumab was approved in the United 
States on 17 Apr 2018 for the treatment of XLH in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older; 
on 27 Sep 2019, the indication was expanded to include infants from 6 months of age. Burosumab is also 
approved in a number of other countries including Canada (05 Dec 2018; with expansion of the indication 
in June 2020 to include infants from 6 months of age), Israel (05 Feb 2019) and the United Arab Emirates 
(12 Feb 2019), for the treatment of XLH in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older. 
On  18  Jun  2020,  burosumab  was  approved  in  the  United  States  for  the  treatment  of  FGF23-related 
hypophosphataemia in TIO associated with PMT that cannot be curatively resected or localised in adult and 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older. Burosumab was also approved in Japan on 20 Sep 2019 for 
the  treatment  of  FGF23-related hypophosphataemic rickets  and  osteomalacia, including  TIO.  On  17  Sep 
2020, Marketing Authorisation was granted in South Korea for the same indication as Japan. Applications 
for the treatment of TIO are also planned for other countries including Canada, Australia and Israel. 
The most recent postmarketing experience of burosumab in XLH is reflected in the Periodic Safety Update 
Report covering the period to 18 Aug 2020, and reflects a total of 2,852 patients exposed to burosumab

national territories of the EU, Switzerland, Latin America, Australia and Gulf Cooperation Council countries. 
Patient Support Programmes are on-going in Canada, Germany and the United States. 
Overall, the majority of AEs reported in post-marketing setting are either expected ADRs with burosumab 
use and/or the underlying conditions being treated. No significant actions related to safety of burosumab 
were taken or proposed during this reporting period and there were no changes to the important identified 
or important potential risks.  
Table 43: Cumulative Exposure from the EAP and Post-marketing Experience 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety data base in TIO subject comprises 27 subjects with a total of 63 patient years. However, 
there are not considered to be any reasons for why the safety data base for burosumab in the treatment 
of XLH would not be relevant also for the TIO population. No subjects from the paediatric population were 
included in the studies. The proposed extension of indication for the treatment of TIO includes subjects 
aged from one year.

Upon request, the MAH has provided an update of the safety data up to the end of both studies. This 
summary did not indicate a differing safety profile relative to that previously characterised. 
Direct comparisons between the adult XLH and TIO populations are hampered by differences both in the 
study design and in the study populations. For example, the mean age was substantially higher in the two 
studies in the TIO population compared to the pivotal adult XLH study UX023-CL303 (57 years, 60 years 
and 41 years, for UX023T-CL201, KRN23-002 and UX023-CL303, respectively). This may indicate that the 
TIO population has more co-morbidities and is generally frailer than the adult XLH population.  
As in the adult XLH safety database, almost all subjects in the TIO safety set reported at least one TEAE.  
The most common TEAEs reported (≥ 20% of subjects) included nasopharyngitis (44.4%), arthralgia 
(37.0%), pain in extremity (37.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (25.9%), and cough (22.2%). The 
spectrum of TEAE was similar between the adult XLH and TIO populations. One notable difference was 
seen in SOC Neoplasms, in which 10/27 subjects (37%) reported at least one event. Most events were 
serious. Furthermore, unike the XLH population, there were three subjects reporting adverse events of 
septic shock. This is further discussed below.  
Fourteen subjects (52%) were reported with at least one TEAE deemed as reated to treatment. Four 
related TEAEs were reported for more than one subject across the studies. These four events (injection 
site reaction, hyperphosphataemia, vitamin D deficiency and rash) are labelled as adverese drug 
reactions for burosumab. 
More subjects in the TIO population reported a SAE (41% vs 16% for the XLH population); however, none 
of the SAE were deemed as related to burosumab treatment.  
In total, ten subjects over the two studies reported at least one SAE associated to the SOC neoplasm. The 
most common PT was Neoplasm progression (n=4). These four subjects, all had a medical history of 
mesenchymal tumours with progression, recurrence or metastases before initiating burosumab. It is 
agreed with the MAH that the events of neoplasm progression in these cases are most probably unrelated 
to study treatment and rather manifestations of the underlying disease. As pointed out by the MAH, 
based on its mechanism of action, burosumab treatment is intended to address the FGF23-driven 
pathophysiology of TIO, and is not expected to impact the natural course of the underlying tumour. This 
is fully agreed.  
Two additional subjects reported an SAE with a preferred term (PT) that seemed to indicate a neoplasm 
unrelated to the underlying disease (Tumour compression, Metastases to lung); however, in both cases 
the events were related to a pre-existing mesenchymal tumour. In one subject (PT Meningioma), the 
lesion was identified several years before study start, precluding a causal association to burosumab 
treatment.  
For the remaining three subjects (PT Large Intestine Polyp [2] and disseminated ovarian cancer), the 
respective neoplasms were diagnosed during the course of the studies. None of these events were 
deemed as related by the Investigator/sponsor. The MAH argues that Large Intestine Polyp is a common 
condition among middle-aged healthy subjects. This is acknowledged. The SAE of ovarian cancer was 
discussed under fatal events. 
All cases of neoplasm progression occurred in Study UX023T-CL201 with no reported cases in KRN23-
002. The MAH has clarified that all subjects reporting tumour progression had a previous history of 
tumour recurrence/progression. Any assessment of the potential cause of the apparent discrepancy in 
tumour progression between the studies is limited by the low numbers of subjects in each study. PMTs 
are a rare and heterologous set of neoplasms. Variability in the definition of tumour progression is also a 
potential aspect to take into consideration. Based on the known pharmacology of burosumab, there is no 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 95/111 
 
 
 
 
expectation of a causal role in tumour progression. Based on this argumentation, the MAH considers this 
discrepancy in tumour progression between the studies as incidental. This is accepted. 
No SAE of septic shock was reported in the adult XLH development program versus three in the TIO 
population 3/27; 11%). This high rate is somewhat surprising. However, there was nothing remarkable in 
the narratives of the three events (a 59-year-old man with obesity, gallstone pancreatitis and cholangitis; 
a 72-year-old man with coliform enteritis from suspected food poisoning and a 75-year-old woman with 
pyelonephritis). As pointed out earlier, the TIO population was older than the XLH population. No further 
actions are considered warranted. 
Prespecified Events to Monitor for burosumab are Injection site reaction, Hypersensitivity, 
Hyperphosphataemia, Ectopic mineralisation and Restless leg syndrome. The total exposure-adjusted 
event incidence for the Prespecified Events to Monitor was generally somewhat higher in the TIO 
populations; however, there were no substantial differences that merits any further actions, except for 
Hyperphosphataemia.  
Two events of hyperphosphataemia were reported: one in a subject with serum phosphate in the normal 
range before initiating burosumab and one in subject receiving radiation therapy against the underlying 
tumour.  
The first event reflects the definition of the study population, in which only subjects with a serum 
phosphate level below lower level of normal (<2.5 mg/dL or 0.8 mmol/L). Thus, this subject should not 
have been included in the study. Overall, it is highly questionable that burosumab should be started in a 
subject with normal range serum phosphate regardless of indication. In section 4.4 of the approved SmPC 
it is recommended that fasting serum phosphate is targeted in the lower end of the normal reference 
range for age. This is considered adequate.  
The second event shows the need of extra monitoring and dose adjustments in subjects undergoing 
treatment against the underlying disease. Information on dose modification and increased serum 
phosphorus monitoring in the case of a patient undergoing treatment for the underlying tumour has been 
introduced in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC.  
In general, there were large variations in laboratory values both between and within the studies. Mean 
change from baseline varied between increase and decrease between different time points, hampering 
firm conclusions. However, there seems to be no consistent and meaningful changes over time in 
laboratory parameters.  
Occasional TEAE were reported in laboratory parameters. All TEAE but two (two events of vitamin D-
deficiency) were deemed as unrelated by the investigator. Vitamin D decreased is already labelled in the 
SmPC for both the adult and paediatric population. One SAE was reported, elevated serum amylase in the 
subject with gallstone pancreatitis. Elevated serum amylase is expected with pancreatitis. 
Two subjects developed transient antidrug antibodies (ADA) during the studies. Both subjects were 
negative for neutralising antibodies and no TEAE for injection site reactions or hypersensitivity were 
reported to coincide with the time point of the positive ADA test 
The most up to date PSUR (#5, covering the period 19/2/20-18/8/20) did not identify any new safety 
concerns, with the majority of AEs reported are either expected ADRs with burosumab use and/or the 
underlying conditions being treated and the overall B/R remaining positive. The applicant has submitted a 
table summarising cumulative exposure post-marketing. A column in this table lists 98 patients as 
receiving burosumab under an EAP, including some TIO patients. Upon request, the MAH has clarified that 
the total number of patients with tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) exposed to burosumab in the post-
marketing setting, calculated based on sales and marketing experience, cumulatively up to 31 July 2021 
is 91 patients, with 90 adult patients and 1 adolescent patient (from commercial setting in the United 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 96/111 
 
 
 
 
States). No additional post-marketing paediatric data in the TIO setting are available and therefore no 
paediatric safety concerns have been identified.  
There is no safety database from clinical studies supporting the proposed maximum dose in adults with 
TIO; 2 mg/kg Q2W up to a maximum of 180 mg per administration. Only one single subject in the 
current TIO studies received this dose. Upon request, the MAH has summarised non-clinical data on 
potential safety concerns with high doses of burosumab. In a non-clinical study, adult monkeys were 
administered up to 30 mg/kg, which according to the MAH would correlate to a dose of 100 mg/kg in 
adult humans, for up to 40 weeks. There was no evidence of possible off-target toxicity, even at the 
highest dose. The dose limiting safety concern in animal studies was related to the on-target 
pharmacological effect, i.e., ectopic mineralisation of multiple tissues and organs (e.g., kidney, heart, 
lung, and aorta), and associated secondary consequences (e.g., nephrocalcinosis) in some cases. This 
was closely related to hyperphosphataemia and was observed in animals only at doses of burosumab that 
resulted in serum phosphate concentrations greater than approximately 8 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). This is 
already reflected with wordings in section 4.2 and 4.4 in the SmPC advising prescribers to target fasting 
serum phosphate in the lower end of the normal reference range for age and to monitor levels of fasting 
serum phosphate to minimise the risk of hyperphosphatemia. This is considered sufficient. 
Upon request, the MAH has reiterated that there are no safety concerns limiting the maximum dose per 
administration in subjects with XLH to 90 mg. The use of two different levels for the maximum dose to be 
given at one administration is still not fully understood. Notwithstanding, as there are no indications of a 
safety issue at any of the different maximum doses, the issue is not further pursued. 
In summary, there were no new and unexpected safety issues in the limited safety database of the TIO 
population compared to the known safety profile of Crysvita.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No data are available on the use of burosumab in paediatric subjects. The proposed indication includes 
subjects from 1 years old and specific information on dose titration based on PK/PD modelling in 
paediatric subjects. The applicant comments that ADR profiles in paediatric and adult subjects in the XLH 
development program were in general comparable with few exceptions. This is reassuring, however, the 
lack of any safety data in this population represents an uncertainty. It must be acknowledged that the 
TIO population differs significantly from the XLH population in terms of heterogeneity of the underlying 
condition. Specifically, FGF23 levels and consequent hypophosphataemia are dependent on underlying 
tumour burden. No data have been submitted and limited information are available on disease 
progression in TIO paediatric patients. 
The MAH was asked to discuss whether the differences in clinical manifestations of TIO between adults 
and children are likely to affect the extrapolation of safety data. In response, the MAH has presented a 
summary from a recent paper (Jiajue et al. 2021), summarising data from adolescents (age range 14-20 
years) with TIO. In general, clinical manifestation in these cases was comparable to adults, though it 
should be noted that the majority of this cohort are adolescents rather than children. Serum FGF23 levels 
were modestly higher, though this may be related to normal age-related differences rather than differing 
pathology. It is also accepted that this a heterologous condition. A company sponsored literature search 
between 2006-2020 identified 42 cases of TIO in subjects under the age of 18 years, with none less than 
two years old. 
It is agreed that based on the highly limited dataset available, there is no indication of any paediatric 
specific clinical manifestations of TIO raising specific concerns related to the extrapolation of safety data.

Upon  request,  the  MAH  has  amended  the  SmPC  to  increase  the  frequency  of  serum  phosphate 
measurements following initiation of treatment in paediatric TIO subjects to the same frequency as for XLH 
paediatric patients monitoring, i.e., every 2 weeks initially. 
It is noted, based on the most recent PSUR (#5), that a post approval surveillance program in adult and 
paediatric patients with TIO has been agreed with the FDA. The MAH has agreed to provide information on 
the  status  of  the  Tumour-induced  Osteomalacia  Disease  Monitoring  Program  (TIO  DMP,  study  number 
UX023T-CL403) and a summary of the data evaluation as included in the Annual Progress Reports in the 
PSURs submitted in the EU. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The total safety data base in TIO subject comprises of 27 subjects with a total of 63 patient years. No 
paediatric subjects were included in the studies.  
While it is acknowledged that this is an ultra-rare condition, the relatively low number of treated TIO 
subjects and the lack of placebo-controlled data as well as the absence of any safety data in TIO 
paediatric subjects renders the interpretation of the safety data generated problematic. In general, the 
safety profile of burosumab in the limited TIO safety data set presented is comparable to what has 
previously been reported in the XLH population. No indication of clinical manifestations specific for 
paediatric subjects with TIO compared to adults has emerged to date. Thus, no specific concerns related 
to the extrapolation of safety data from the adult TIO population have been identified.  
There is no safety database from clinical studies supporting the proposed maximum dose in adults with 
TIO; 2 mg/kg Q2W up to a maximum of 180 mg per administration. Only one single subject in the 
current TIO studies received this dose. However, in animal studies, there was no evidence of possible off-
target toxicity, even at the highest dose. The dose limiting safety concern in animal studies was related to 
the on-target pharmacological effect, i.e., ectopic mineralisation. This is already reflected with wordings 
in section 4.2 and 4.4 in the SmPC advising prescribers to target fasting serum phosphate in the lower 
end of the normal reference range for age and to monitor levels of fasting serum phosphate to minimise 
the risk of hyperphosphatemia. This is considered sufficient. 
In summary, there were no new and unexpected safety issues in the limited safety database of the TIO 
population compared to the known safety profile of Crysvita.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Crysvita. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare, serious, and debilitating condition caused by 
overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by a tumour. The causative tumours are typically 
phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours (PMTs), a heterogeneous set of bone and soft tissue tumours that 
have a distinct histological appearance.  
The incidence of TIO is not established; however, the MAH cites a recent study from Europe, indicating an 
incidence of approximately 0.1/100,000 per person year in Denmark. In the literature, around 500 
reports of TIO have been published.  
High levels of circulating fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) leads to excessive urinary phosphate 
excretion and subsequent hypophosphataemia, resulting in defective bone mineralisation with 
osteomalacia, fractures and bone deformities requiring surgical intervention. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
When possible, tumour resection is the first line of treatment for TIO and can be curative. However, 
identifying the location of the causative tumour is often difficult, despite functional and anatomical 
imaging. Approximately 35% to 40% of patients with TIO have tumours that cannot be localised and 
therefore cannot be surgically excised. Furthermore, concomitant medical conditions and/or risk factors 
may preclude surgery in some subjects. When the tumour cannot be located or when complete resection 
is not possible, medical treatment should be initiated. 
There is no approved or available therapy that specifically treats the underlying pathophysiology of 
elevated FGF23-induced hypophosphataemia in TIO in subjects in whom the underlying tumour could not 
be located or resected. Current medical management includes supplementation therapy with multiple 
daily doses of oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D analogues. The phosphate dose required to improve 
clinical symptoms is often limited by intolerable gastrointestinal side effects and the rapid phosphate 
Assessment report

Page 99/111 
 
 
 
 
homeostasis requires multiple daily administrations. In some cases, active vitamin D alone may be 
administered.  
Oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy does not correct renal phosphate wasting, the underlying cause 
of hypophosphataemia, and resultant osteomalacia. In addition, oral phosphate therapy may exacerbate 
phosphate wasting by increasing the renal phosphate load since the impairment in renal phosphate 
reabsorption due to excess FGF23 is not addressed. The intermittent phosphate load also triggers high 
urinary phosphate excretion and increases the risk and progression of nephrocalcinosis and 
nephrolithiasis. In some instances, the compensatory increases in parathyroid hormone (PTH) may 
increase the risk of developing secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn can lead to 
hypercalciuria, and thereby further increase the risk of nephrocalcinosis. As such, oral phosphate/active 
vitamin D treatment requires frequent monitoring to mitigate the risks of nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, 
and hyperparathyroidism. 
More efficacious, safer, and convenient therapies are clearly needed for patients who experience FGF23-
related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia in subjects with TIO with tumours that 
cannot be localised or surgically resected. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH has provided two studies to support the efficacy of burosumab in the treatment of TIO in adult 
subjects, UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002. No studies have been performed in paediatric subjects with 
TIO.  
UX023T-CL201 was an open-label, single arm, multicentre, Phase 2 study in adult subjects (≥18 years) 
with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia with fasting serum phosphorus level < 2.5 mg/dL (<0.81 
mmol/l) in the United States. The study included an initial 48-week Treatment Period followed by a 
Treatment Extension Period for a total treatment duration of up to 300 weeks. Efficacy and safety data 
are presented through 144 weeks of treatment. 
In this study, 14 subjects with TIO were included.  
KRN23-002 was an open-label, single arm, multicentre, Phase 2 study in adult subjects (≥18 years) 
with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia with fasting serum phosphorus level < 2.5 mg/dL (<0.81 
mmol/l) in Japan and South Korea with treatment up to 144 weeks.  
Study KRN23-002 included 13 subjects with TIO.  
Although both studies were designed to also include subjects with Epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS)-
associated osteomalacia, given the rare nature of this disease, only one subject with ENS-associated 
osteomalacia was enrolled in Study UX023T-CL201 and none in KRN23-002. No claims regarding ENS 
have been made in the current procedure.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are major limitations with the data presented to support the indication to treat FGF23-related 
hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia. 
In total, not more than 27 subjects were enrolled in the two studies in the application to extend the 
indication for Crysvita to include treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced 
osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or 
localised, in patients aged 1 year and over.  
After the data cut off for the initial submission for the current variation at Week 144/88, the number of 
subjects active in the study decreased markedly. Only 4/27 subjects seem to adhere to treatment until 
the end of the studies. the MAH has clarified that this was in large part due to that per study protocol, the 
study duration differed depending on whether subjects transitioned off the study to receive commercial 
burosumab treatment when it became available in their territory. For the remaining subjects 
discontinuing the study, it is agreed with the MAH that the vast majority could be considered unrelated to 
treatment. 
No TIO subject under the age of 18 years have been treated with burosumab in the clinical studies. There 
is very limited data on burosumab treatment in paediatric subjects, mostly adolescents, with TIO from 
case reports in the literature and post-marketing data from the US and Japan. In the US, burosumab is 
approved for treatment of TIO in subjects from the age of two years. The MAH has clarified that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 102/111 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher age limit in the US was based on lack of data rather than specific safety concerns. Moreover, the 
MAH state that there is safety data available from one year of age in the XLH population to support the 
safe use of burosumab safety in this age cohort. 
The dosing regimen for the paediatric population was evaluated by modelling and simulation that 
extrapolated adult population PK and PK/PD models to paediatric age groups. It is reasonable to assume 
that the PK/PD of burosumab would be similar in paediatric patients to that in adult patients with TIO, 
and that any potential differences in the PD relationship between adults and paediatrics is likely to be 
captured by the proposed weight-based posology of burosumab.  
In the posology for the TIO indication, the MAH proposes the same starting dose as used in the studies, 
i.e., 0.3 mg/kg Q4W, and a maintenance dose up to 2 mg/kg Q4W or even Q2W (maximum 180 mg per 
administration). The proposed starting dose in the paediatric TIO population is 0.4 mg/kg for subjects 
≤12 years of age and 0.3 mg/kg for subjects >12 years of age. The approved starting dose for adult 
subjects with XLH is 1 mg/kg. No maximum weight-based dose in adults with XLH is provided in the 
SmPC; however, the maximum absolute dose is 90 mg per administration, restricting the dose to 
approximately 1.3 mg/kg in a subject weighing 70 kg. 
For none of the studies was there a prospective discussion on a minimum required level of efficacy for the 
study to be interpreted as successful and analyses were conducted without any consideration concerning 
multiplicity. The open label nature of both studies without an adequate control in a small number of 
patients where a priori statistical criteria of success had not been clearly defined in the presence of 
potential confounding were, and still are, major deficiencies that limits interpretation of the primary and 
secondary endpoints efficacy results. The resulting inferences from the provided study data can only be 
considered as preliminary and not confirmatory. This conclusion has not changed albeit will not be further 
pursued.  
Moreover, there is substantial heterogenicity among subjects with TIO, leading to complexity of the study 
results. Differences in disease severity and duration, levels of FGF-23, dosing and compliance with oral 
phosphate/active vitamin D treatment prior to study entry contribute to this heterogenicity. 
Regarding potential confounding the MAH’s reply was far from adequate, and the Applicant was again 
requested, for both studies (KRN23-002 and UX023T-CL201), to address the impact of confounding on 
the observed results, in particular the primary and secondary outcome. By now, the MAH’s has provided 
some evidence of the impact of covariates/potential confounders on outcomes. The analyses do not 
provide an equivalent estimate of a treatment effect in the context of comparative evidence due to the 
limitation of the design, being a single arm trial. Consequently, the matter is partially resolved, but not 
pursued further as definitive evidence of an unbiased effect as a consequence of confounding would be 
very difficult to derive. 
The studies were not designed to show efficacy against standard of care for the condition, i.e. active 
Vitamin D and/or phosphate. The lack of comparator is considered a major weakness with the TIO 
development program.  
The MAH argues that the lack of control group could be compensated by the vast majority of subjects 
being treated with Vitamin D and/or phosphate before entering the study. Per the study protocols, active 
treatment with oral phosphate substitution and active Vitamin D should be withdrawn at least two weeks 
prior to the screening visit. As such previous treatment was not an eligibility criterion for the studies, no 
earliest time for withdrawal of conventional therapy was identified. In Study UX023T-CL201, subjects 
were without oral phosphate and vitamin D therapy for at least 6 weeks, and in Study KRN23-002, 
subjects were without oral phosphate and vitamin D treatment for at least 8 weeks. However, actual 
screening periods varied for each subject. Oral phosphate is normally given 3-5 times daily, as serum 
phosphate is rapidly regulated in the body, precluding that serum phosphate levels would be sustained 
several weeks or months after withdrawal of conventional therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 103/111 
 
 
 
 
The MAH has provided a summary of the last regular serum phosphate measurement before entering the 
study for comparison to study measurements. Data is difficult to interpret as regular measurements were 
only available for in total 17 subjects (UX023T-CL201: n=8; KRN23-002: n=9), the time between the last 
regular serum phosphate measurement and the baseline measurements varied greatly, and, at least in 
study UX023T-CL201, this time was generally several months long. Furthermore, only one pre-withdrawal 
phosphate measurement was available for each subject. Nevertheless, a numerical decrease in mean 
serum phosphate of approximately 0.5 mg/dL was seen between last regular measurement and baseline. 
As the phosphate co-primary analysis in study UX023T-CL201 was not a comparison to baseline 
phosphate levels, this is not considered to impact the primary endpoint. For KRN23-002, the primary 
endpoint was “Serum phosphorus concentrations at each test timepoint”; however, only descriptive 
statistics were applied. The MAH has presented updated graphs with a “pre-withdrawal” timepoint in the 
SmPC.  
As described in detail elsewhere, the original readers of the (pseudo)fracture data had access to prior 
radiographs and scans in order to assess the evolution of individual fracture and pseudofracture healing 
but were blinded to patient medical history and the study design. Due to the open label single arm study 
design, the risk of bias is considered substantial if the radiographs were read in pairs. To overcome this, 
the MAH has undertaken a re-read of all available images (bone scans and X-rays) by an independent 
reading centre. Images were assessed without reference to baseline images and were provided to the 
reader in a random order. The reader was tasked with assessing each bone scan and X-ray to identify the 
presence of fractures or pseudofractures. The number of fractures is low, resulting in small and 
sometimes contradictory results when comparing the effect of burosumab on single fracture locations 
between the studies and between the modalities. Notwithstanding, there was, as in the original reads, a 
consistent decrease in the total number of fractures and pseudofractures after initiation of burosumab in 
both studies and with both modalities also in the re-read. A reduction in both the number of patients 
reporting symptomatic fractures as adverse events and in the number of fractures reported in UX023T-
CL201 was seen after initiation of burosumab treatment. Taken together, numerically, from the blinded 
re-reads, there seems to be a decrease in fractures with initiation of burosumab treatment. 
Patient-reported symptoms are considered of limited value in open label studies. Furthermore, the 
subjects had been off conventional treatment with active Vitamin D and/or oral phosphate for several 
weeks at baseline. This may have worsened physical performance and thereby the reported HRQL at 
baseline, which in turn may raise expectations of resumed treatment. The patient-reported outcomes, 
albeit in support for the proposed indication, needs to be interpreted with caution.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Fatal events 
Two fatal events were reported in Study UX023T-CL201, one during the course of the study and one after 
Week 144.  
•  One Subject died at study day 358 from cardiac arrest in conjunction respiratory failure and 
septic shock following gallstone associated pancreatitis and cholangitis.  
•  One Subject, >70y, died at day 1450 from multiorgan failure and disseminated ovarian cancer 
diagnosed approximately one month before the fatal event. 
None of the events were deemed as related by Investigator/Sponsor.

Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) 
•  UX023T-CL201 
o  Subjects with any TEAE (n [%]): 14 (100%) 
o  Subjects with related TEAE (n [%]): 9 (64%) 
•  KRN23-002 
o  Subjects with any TEAE (n [%]): 12 (92%) 
o  Subjects with related TEAE (n [%]): 5 (38) 
The most common TEAEs reported (≥ 20% of subjects) included nasopharyngitis (44.4%), arthralgia 
(37.0%), pain in extremity (37.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (25.9%), and cough (22.2%). 
Related TEAEs that were reported for at least two subjects across studies included injection site reaction, 
hyperphosphataemia, vitamin D deficiency and rash 
The spectrum of TEAE was similar between the adult XLH and TIO populations. The number of related 
TEAE was higher in the TIO populations compared to the adult XLH population; however, the mean age 
was substantially higher in the two studies in the TIO population compared to the pivotal adult XLH study.  
Serious adverse events (SAE) 
•  UX023T-CL201 
o  Subjects with any SAE (n [%]): 7 (50%) 
o  Subjects with related SAE (n [%]): 0 
•  KRN23-002 
o  Subjects with any SAE (n [%]): 4 (31%) 
o  Subjects with related SAE (n [%]): 0 
More subjects in the TIO versus the XLH population reported a SAE (41% vs 16%, respectively); 
however, none of the SAE were deemed as related. 
In total, ten subjects over the two studies reported at least one SAE associated to the SOC neoplasm. In 
six subjects, the events were related to a pre-existing mesenchymal tumour. In one subject, the lesion 
(meningioma) was identified several years before study start. For the remaining three subjects (PT Large 
Intestine Polyp [2] and disseminated ovarian cancer), the respective neoplasms were diagnosed during 
the course of the studies. None of these events were deemed as related by the Investigator/sponsor. 
Three subjects (11%) reported a SAE of septic shock. There was nothing remarkable in the narratives of 
the three events and the events were deemed as unrelated.  
Prespecified Events to Monitor 
Prespecified Events to Monitor for burosumab are Injection site reaction, Hypersensitivity, 
Hyperphosphataemia, Ectopic mineralisation and Restless leg syndrome: 
• 
Injection site reaction 4/27 (15%) 
•  Hypersensitivity 6/27 (22%) 
•  Hyperphosphataemia 2/27 (7%) 
• 
Ectopic mineralisation 3/27 (11%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/634749/2022 
Page 105/111 
 
 
 
 
•  Restless legs syndrome 2/27 (7%) 
The total exposure-adjusted event incidence for the Prespecified Events to Monitor was generally 
somewhat higher in the TIO populations compared to the adult XLH population. 
Two events of hyperphosphataemia were reported: one in a subject with serum phosphate in the normal 
range before initiating burosumab and one in subject receiving radiation therapy against the underlying 
tumour. 
Antidrug antibodies (ADA) 
Two subjects developed transient antidrug antibodies (ADA) during the studies. Both subjects were 
negative for neutralising antibodies and no TEAE for injection site reactions or hypersensitivity were 
reported to coincide with the time point of the positive ADA test 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The maximum burosumab dose in adults with TIO according the proposed SmPC was 2 mg/kg Q2W with 
an absolute maximum dose of 180 mg per administration. In Study KRN23-002, no subject was given a 
higher dose than 1.8 mg/kg and no subject was given an absolute dose of 180 mg on any occasion.  
In Study UX023T-CL201, only one subject used the maximum dose (2 mg/kg); however, another subject 
also reached the maximum absolute dose of 180 mg. For one subject (the subject given the 2 mg/kg 
dose), the option to administer burosumab Q2W was used. Thus, there is no safety database from clinical 
studies supporting this dose, not even from the current TIO studies. The total safety data base in TIO 
subject comprises of 27 subjects with a total of 63 patient years. It is accepted that this is an ultra-rare 
condition, however, the relatively low number of treated TIO subjects and the lack of placebo-controlled 
data as well as the absence of any safety data in TIO paediatric subjects makes the interpretation of the 
safety data generated difficult.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Low serum phosphate caused by uncontrolled production of FGF-23 from Phosphaturic mesenchymal 
tumours (PMT) is the main laboratory abnormality of TIO. The negative consequences of longstanding 
hypophosphataemia on skeletal health and quality of life are well known. Hypophosphatemia caused by 
TIO in adults results in many structural and metabolic consequences that contribute to a complex array of 
symptoms, especially stiffness and pain, as well as poor mineralisation with subsequent 
fractures/pseudofractures which together cause a decrease in physical function and mobility, leading to 
substantially impaired overall health. 
Despite conventional treatment with active Vitamin D and/or oral phosphate, phosphate levels remained

low, bone pain persisted, and bone mineral density decreased significantly in many subjects with PMTs 
that could not be localised or are not accessible to surgery. The unmet medical need and burden of 
disease in this population is therefore fully acknowledged.  
Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 have shown that burosumab administration significantly improved 
serum phosphorus levels and that phosphate control was maintained with burosumab treatment over 
time. Serum phosphate, being a surrogate pharmacodynamic marker for clinical effect, could be 
questioned as the most important clinical endpoint, but chronic hypophosphataemia is a major contributor 
to the pathophysiology of the disease as described above. It is anticipated that normalisation of serum 
phosphate has a beneficial effect on bone calcification. In addition, normalisation of serum phosphate 
should have a direct, positive effect on symptoms from low serum phosphate per se, e.g., muscle 
weakness and fatigue. The magnitude of increase in serum phosphorus concentration shown with 
burosumab treatment is considered clinically relevant. The increase in serum phosphate was accompanied 
by a sustained increase in phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR), and serum 1,25(OH)2D levels in both 
studies, supporting the primary analysis. 
The Applicant has presented data in support of beneficial effects, shown by statistical significance or as 
numerical trends favouring burosumab, on bone mineralisation, functional mobility and strength, the 
number of new (pseudo)fractures and quality of life in both studies. The true extent of these 
improvements, and whether they will be maintained over the long-term or not, is still unclear. The study 
population in studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 is very limited and there are major limitations of the 
study design and study conduct, giving partly modest and inconsistent results, as described above.  
With this said, the difficulties to conduct scientific studies in an ultra-rare disease as TIO, with 
approximately 500 published cases worldwide, are acknowledged. Differences in disease severity and 
duration, levels of FGF-23, dosing and compliance with oral phosphate/active vitamin D treatment prior to 
study entry are additional obstacles which likely have contributed to the complexity of the study results. 
In this context, the positive trends and numerical improvements in fracture data, bone mineralisation and 
Quality of life, albeit not fully robust, can be considered supportive of a beneficial effect of burosumab on 
subjects with TIO associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected 
or localised. The clinical benefit is further supported by case reports from the literature and individual 
testimonies from study subjects reporting considerable improvements in signs and symptoms of TIO since 
beginning treatment with burosumab. 
In addition, although the underlying causes of TIO and XLH are unique, both conditions are characterised 
by elevated FGF23, resulting in excessive renal phosphate wasting by impaired phosphate reabsorption, 
reduced vitamin D synthesis, and chronic hypophosphataemia. Effects of similar magnitude on serum 
phosphate with burosumab treatment have been reported for both conditions, taking a more conservative 
starting dosing in the TIO study population into consideration. There are no indications that normalisation 
of serum phosphate would not lead to similar beneficial effect on e.g., bone mineralisation and quality of 
life in the TIO population as in the XLH population. The same limitations apply for TIO subjects with 
longstanding hypophosphataemia as for XLH subjects started on burosumab in adult age. In the light of 
the same and very specific pathogenetic mechanism in both conditions, extrapolation of efficacy results 
from the XLH studies in combination with the (less robust) results from the TIO study, is considered to 
support to the extended indication to FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia 
associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or localised, in 
children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years and in adults. 
No paediatric patients were included in the TIO studies. However, burosumab is indicated in children with 
XLH from the age of one year. Given the mechanistic relationship with XLH, the safety profile from 
children and adolescents with XLH is considered possible to extrapolate to the paediatric TIO population.

There are also no indications from the very limited safety data base, that any specific safety issues should 
apply to the adult TIO population compared to the XLH population. 
It is not agreed that baseline data in Studies UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 could be considered “on 
treatment” with conventional therapy. No direct comparisons to other treatments are therefore accepted. 
Notwithstanding, as pointed out above, many TIO patients have limited effect of active Vitamin D and/or 
oral phosphate. Furthermore, conventional treatment is administered as multiple daily doses, associated 
with high non-compliance in both adults and children that compromise their overall tolerability long term. 
Treatment is often associated with potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria and secondary 
hyperparathyroidism. The beneficial effect of burosumab on phosphate homeostasis in the TIO population 
is therefore considered of clinical relevance also in the absence of a comparator.  
Overall, the adverse events presented from the pivotal adult patient study did not demonstrate a 
significantly differing safety profile in TIO relative to XLH subjects. However, the available safety data in 
the adult population are limited and there are no safety data in paediatric subjects. However, no new and 
unexpected safety concerns have emerged from Study UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002 up to the end of 
the studies relative to the XLH population. No indication of clinical manifestations specific for paediatric 
subjects with TIO compared to adults has emerged to date. Thus, no specific concerns related to the 
extrapolation of safety data from the adult TIO population have been identified. 
There is no safety database from clinical studies, neither in XLH nor TIO, supporting the proposed 
maximum dose in adults with TIO; 2 mg/kg Q2W up to a maximum of 180 mg per administration. Only 
one single subject in the current TIO studies received this dose.  
Upon request, the MAH has summarised non-clinical data on potential safety concerns with high doses of 
burosumab. In a non-clinical study, adult monkeys were administered up to 30 mg/kg, which according to 
the MAH would correlate to a dose of 100 mg/kg in adult humans, for up to 40 weeks. There was no 
evidence of possible off-target toxicity, even at the highest dose. The dose limiting safety concern in 
animal studies was related to the on-target pharmacological effect, i.e., ectopic mineralisation of multiple 
tissues and organs (e.g., kidney, heart, lung, and aorta), and associated secondary consequences (e.g., 
nephrocalcinosis) in some cases. This was closely related to hyperphosphataemia and was observed in 
animals only at doses of burosumab that resulted in serum phosphate concentrations greater than 
approximately 8 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). This is already reflected with wordings in section 4.2 and 4.4 in the 
SmPC advising prescribers to target fasting serum phosphate in the lower end of the normal reference 
range for age and to monitor levels of fasting serum phosphate to minimise the risk of 
hyperphosphatemia. This is considered sufficient. 
The discrepancy in posology between XLH, allowing a maximum absolute dose per administration of 90 
mg, and TIO, allowing up to 180 mg is still not fully understood. Notwithstanding, the MAH has clarified 
that there have been no safety findings that would suggest that XLH patients should receive an overall 
lower maximum dose, capped at 90 mg and that the dosing merely reflects the maximum dose given in 
the studies. The issue is therefore not further pursued. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
It is acknowledged that there is a clear unmet need for additional treatments for patients with this rare 
condition of TIO with tumours that cannot be localised and therefore cannot be surgically excised. 
Burosumab treatment has demonstrated a reversal of hypophosphatemia. The increase in serum 
phosphate levels were statistically significant and the magnitude considered to be of clinical relevance. 
The study population is extremely small and with substantial heterogenicity in disease severity, leading to 
large variations in statistical analyses and inconsistencies in the data. Statistical significance has not been 
shown for all secondary endpoints, and the data is not considered fully robust. However, improvements,

albeit partly modest, on fracture data, bone mineralisation and quality of life, has been presented. This is 
considered to support that normalisation of serum phosphate levels by burosumab have similar beneficial 
effects in inoperable TIO subjects as in the XLH population.  
The safety profile of burosumab in the XLH population is considered manageable, provided 
recommendations monitoring of serum phosphate and ectopic mineralisation are observed. No indication 
of a different safety profile has emerged from the very limited safety database in the TIO population.  
Therefore, the CHMP considers that, despite the well-recognised study limitations and the small data set, 
the totality of evidence is sufficient to support an extension of indication for Crysvita to include the 
treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced osteomalacia associated with 
phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or localised in patients aged 1 
year and over. The limitations of the studies are reflected in section 5.1 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Crysvita for the treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced 
osteomalacia associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or 
localised in in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years and in adults is considered positive.

Extension of indication to include treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphataemia in tumour-induced 
osteomalacia (TIO) associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively 
resected or localised in children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years and in adults, based on data from 
two ongoing open-label clinical studies, UX023T-CL201 and KRN23-002, in adults with TIO (144-week 
data and 88-week data are available, respectively). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9, 
5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  An updated RMP 
version 6.0 was agreed during the procedure. Further, the MAH’s request for one additional year of 
market protection was also agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended.

Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration 
of EVUSHELD (see section 4.8). If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity 
reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate 
medicinal products and/or supportive therapy.
Cardiovascular and/or thrombo-embolic events
In the PROVENT study, more participants in the EVUSHELD arm experienced serious cardiac or 
thromboembolic adverse events as compared to those in the placebo arm (1.6% versus 0.9%). The 
majority of participants had cardiovascular risk factors and/or history of cardiovascular disease that 
could explain the occurrence of such events. 
A causal relationship between EVUSHELD and these events has not been established.
The risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating EVUSHELD in individuals at high risk 
for cardiovascular or thrombo-embolic events. Patients should be advised of signs or symptoms 
suggestive of cardiovascular event (notably chest pain, dyspnoea, malaise, feeling lightheaded or faint) 
and to seek immediate medical attention if such symptoms occur.
Clinically significant bleeding disorders
As with any other intramuscular injections, EVUSHELD should be given with caution to patients with 
thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder.
Antiviral resistance
The clinical trials with EVUSHELD were conducted when Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants
were predominant. Efficacy of tixagevimab and cilgavimab against some circulating SARS-CoV-2 
variants with decreased in-vitro susceptibility is uncertain (see section 5.1).
Based on clinical data from PROVENT, the duration of protection following administration of a single 
EVUSHELD dose (150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab) is estimated to be at least 
6 months. Due to the observed decrease in in-vitro neutralisation activity against the Omicron 
subvariants BA.1, BA.1.1 (BA.1+R346K), BA.4 and BA.5 the duration of protection of EVUSHELD 
for these subvariants is currently not known.
COVID-19 vaccines
Pre-exposure prophylaxis with EVUSHELD is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom 
COVID-19 vaccination is recommended.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic interactions 
No human interaction studies have been performed.
4
EVUSHELD is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination.
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are not renally excreted or metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes; therefore, interactions with medicinal products that are renally excreted or that are 
substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely.
Based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling, COVID-19 vaccination following EVUSHELD
administration had no clinically relevant impact on the clearance of EVUSHELD.
Based on PK modelling, immunocompromised condition had no clinically relevant impact on the 
clearance of EVUSHELD.
Pharmacodynamic interactions
No human interaction studies have been performed.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited data from the use of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in pregnant women.
Non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with tixagevimab and cilgavimab
(see section 5.3). In tissue cross reactivity studies with tixagevimab and cilgavimab using human 
foetal tissues no binding of clinical concern was detected. Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
antibodies are known to cross the placenta therefore tixagevimab and cilgavimab have the potential to 
be transferred from the mother to the developing foetus. The potential treatment benefit or risk of 
placental transfer of tixagevimab and cilgavimab to the developing foetus is not known.
EVUSHELD should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the 
potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether tixagevimab and cilgavimab are excreted in human milk but maternal IgG is 
known to be transferred to milk during the first days after birth.
As tixagevimab and cilgavimab directly target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and in view of low 
systemic absorption after oral ingestion of antibodies, administration of EVUSHELD whilst breast-
feeding can be considered when clinically indicated.
Fertility
There are no data on the effects of tixagevimab and cilgavimab on human fertility. Effects on male and 
female fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
EVUSHELD has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
A total of 4 210 adult participants have received 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, via 
intramuscular injection, in Phase III prophylaxis studies. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) 
were injection site reactions (1.6%) and hypersensitivity (1.0%).
5
A total of 452 non-hospitalised adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 have received 300 mg 
tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab, via intramuscular injection, in a Phase III treatment study. The 
overall safety profile was similar to that reported in participants who received 150 mg tixagevimab 
and 150 mg cilgavimab in the prophylaxis studies. The most common adverse reaction (≥ 1%) was 
injection site reaction (2.4%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
The adverse reactions in Table 2 are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency. 
Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000) and not known (cannot 
be estimated from available data).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no specific treatment for overdose with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Treatment of overdose 
should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of 
the clinical status of the patient.
In clinical trials, intramuscular doses of up to 300 mg each of tixagevimab and cilgavimab and 
intravenous doses of up to 1 500 mg each of tixagevimab and cilgavimab have been administered 
without dose-limiting toxicity.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immune sera and immunoglobulins, antiviral monoclonal antibodies, 
ATC code: J06BD03
Mechanism of action
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are two recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, with amino 
acid substitutions in the Fc regions, to extend antibody half-life and to reduce antibody effector 
function and potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (see section 5.3). 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab can simultaneously bind to non-overlapping regions of the spike protein 
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination 
bind to spike with equilibrium dissociation constants of KD= 2.76 pM, 13.0 pM and 13.7 pM, 
respectively, blocking its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus 
entry. Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination blocked RBD binding to the human ACE2 
receptor with IC50 values of 0.32 nM (48 ng/mL), 0.53 nM (80 ng/mL) and 0.43 nM (65 ng/mL), 
respectively.
Antiviral activity
In a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation assay on Vero E6 cells, tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their
combination neutralised SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) with EC50 values of 60.7 pM 
(9 ng/mL), 211.5 pM (32 ng/mL) and 65.9 pM (10 ng/mL), respectively. These in-vitro values 
correlate with in-vivo clinically effective serum concentrations of 2.2 µg/mL of EVUSHELD.
Antiviral resistance
SARS-CoV-2 or recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
(pseudovirus) were serially passaged in cell cultures in the presence of tixagevimab or cilgavimab 
individually, or tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination. Escape variants were identified following 
passage with cilgavimab, but not with tixagevimab or tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination.
In neutralisation assays using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses harbouring individual spike 
substitutions identified in circulating SARS-CoV-2, variants with reduced susceptibility to 
tixagevimab alone included those with F486S (> 600-fold) and F486V (121- to 149-fold) and variants 
with reduced susceptibility to cilgavimab alone included those with R346I (> 200-fold), K444E 
(> 200-fold), K444Q (> 200-fold) and K444R (> 200-fold).
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination retained full to nearly full neutralisation activity against 
pseudovirus and/or live virus SARS-CoV-2 variant strains harbouring all spike substitutions identified 
in Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta [+K417N] (AY.1/AY.2), 
and Omicron (BA.2) variants of concern. Pseudotyped VLPs expressing spike protein and authentic 
SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant (B.1.1.529) and Omicron BA.1.1 (B.1.1.529 [+R346K]) showed 
reduced susceptibility to tixagevimab and cilgavimab in combination (Table 3).
Data collection is ongoing to better understand how small reductions in activity seen in authentic 
SARS-CoV-2 or pseudotyped VLP assays may correlate with clinical outcomes.

c
It is not known how pseudovirus or authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation susceptibility data correlate 
with clinical outcome.
In PROVENT, sequencing data collected at illness visits was available for 21 participants with 
symptomatic COVID-19 infection (7 received tixagevimab and cilgavimab, and 14 received placebo). 
At an allele fraction ≥ 25%, the most commonly observed variants of concern or variants of interest 
were Alpha (5 total events; all in placebo) and Delta (7 total events; 6 in placebo and 1 in 
EVUSHELD), with 7 ancestral strain sequences also being observed (3 in placebo and 4 in 
EVUSHELD).
It is possible that resistance-associated variants to tixagevimab and cilgavimab together could have 
cross-resistance to other monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab together retained activity against pseudoviruses harbouring individual SARS-CoV-2 spike 
substitutions (E484D/K/Q, F490S, Q493R, S494P, K417E/N, D420N, K444Q, V445A, Y453F, 
L455F, N460K/S/T, F486V, and Q493K) identified in neutralisation escape variants of other 
monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
In TACKLE, baseline visit sequencing data was available for 748 participants (382 received 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab, and 367 received placebo). At an allele fraction ≥ 25%, the proportion of 
participants infected with variants of concern or variants of interest was balanced between treatment 
group, including participants with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda and Mu. 
Pharmacodynamic effects
In PROVENT, following an intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, at 
Day 8, 29, 58, 92, 183 and 366, the neutralising antibody GMTs were 19, 23, 18, 14, 6, and 3-fold 
greater, respectively, than the GMT measured in convalescent plasma from COVID-19 patients 
(GMT= 30.8).
In TACKLE, following a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of 
cilgavimab, greater than 5-fold increase neutralising antibody GMTs were observed in the 
EVUSHELD group through Day 169 versus the placebo group: 16-, 14-, 22-, 18- and 5.3-fold over 
placebo at Day 6, 15, 29, 85, and 169, respectively.
Immunogenicity
In PROVENT, following a single EVUSHELD dose (150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg 
cilgavimab),treatment-emergent anti-tixagevimab, anti-cilgavimab and anti-EVUSHELD antibodies 
10
were detected in 7.6% (234/3085), 11.3% (341/3024), and 13.1% (403/3086)  ADA-evaluable 
participants who received EVUSHELD.
In TACKLE, following a single EVUSHELD dose (300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab), 
treatment-emergent anti-tixagevimab, anti-cilgavimab and anti-EVUSHELD antibodies were detected 
in 7.3% (27/372), 12.7% (46/363), and 14.5% (54/373) of ADA-evaluable participants, respectively.
No evidence of an association of ADA with any impact on PK or safety has been observed.
Clinical efficacy
Prophylaxis of COVID-19
PROVENT was a Phase III, randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying 
EVUSHELD for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years of age. Enrolled
participants were individuals considered to be at increased risk for inadequate response to active 
immunisation (due to age ≥ 60 years, co-morbidity, pre-existing chronic illness, immunocompromised, 
or intolerant of vaccination) or at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (due to their location or 
circumstances at time of enrolment, for example health care workers including staff for long-term care 
facilities, working in high risk industrial settings or living with high density proximity, including 
students in dormitories and military barracks). Participants received either 150 mg of tixagevimab and 
150 mg of cilgavimab or placebo, administered as two separate intramuscular injections. The study 
excluded participants with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2
antibody positivity at screening.
The baseline demographics were well balanced across the EVUSHELD and placebo arms. The median 
age was 57 years (with 24% of participants aged 65 years or older and 4% of participants aged 
75 years or older), 46% of participants were female, 73% were White, 3% were Asian, 17% were 
Black/African American, and 15% were Hispanic/Latino. Of the 5 197 participants, 78% had baseline 
co-morbidities or characteristics associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19, including 
obesity (42%), diabetes (14%), cardiovascular disease (8%), cancer, including a history of cancer 
(7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5%), chronic kidney disease (5%), chronic liver disease 
(5%), immunosuppressive medications (3%) and immunosuppressive disease (< 1%).
The primary analysis included 5 172 participants who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative at 
baseline, of which 3 441 received EVUSHELD and 1 731 received placebo. EVUSHELD significantly 
(p-value < 0.001) reduced the risk of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness 
(COVID-19) when compared to placebo (Table 4). The median follow-up time post-administration 
was 83 days.

b
Efficacy was consistent across pre-defined sub-groups including age, gender, ethnicity and baseline 
co-morbidities or characteristics associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19.
Among participants who received EVUSHELD there were no severe/critical COVID-19 events
(defined as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness characterised by a minimum of either 
pneumonia [fever, cough, tachypnoea or dyspnoea, and lung infiltrates] or hypoxemia [SpO2 < 90% in 
11
room air and/or severe respiratory distress] and a WHO Clinical Progression Scale score of 5 or 
higher) compared to one event (0.1%) among participants who received placebo.
An additional data cut-off was conducted to provide post-hoc updated safety and efficacy analyses; the 
median follow-up was 6.5 months for participants in both the EVUSHELD and placebo arms. The 
relative risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 83% (95% CI 
66, 91), with 11/3 441 (0.3%) events in the EVUSHELD arm and 31/1 731 (1.8%) events in the 
placebo arm, see Figure 1). Among participants who received EVUSHELD there were no 
severe/critical COVID-19 events compared to five events among participants who received placebo.
In exploratory analyses of all participants who received EVUSHELD or placebo, including 25 
participants who were subsequently found to have been SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive at baseline, 
the relative risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 78% 
(95% CI 59, 88), with 14/3 460 (0.4%) events in the EVUSHELD arm and 31/1 737 (1.8%) events in 
the placebo arm at a median follow-up of 6.5 months.

Time (days)
The predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in circulation for the time period represented in Figure 1 were 
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon and Delta. Based on the incidence of primary endpoint events, the 
duration of efficacy was 6 months.
Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19
TACKLE was a Phase III, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial studying 
EVUSHELD for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The study enrolled 
individuals who had not received COVID-19 vaccination, who were not hospitalised for COVID-19 
treatment, and who had at least 1 or more COVID-19 symptom that was at least mild in severity. 
Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining the sample for a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral 
infection and within ≤7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Patients received standard of care 
treatment and either 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of cilgavimab (N= 413) or placebo (N= 421), 
administered as two separate intramuscular injections. Participants were stratified by time from 
symptom onset (≤5 days versus >5 days) and risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (high risk 
versus low risk).
12
 
 
 
Demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across the treatment and placebo groups. 
At baseline, the median age was 46 years (with 13% of subjects aged 65 years or older), 50% of the 
participants were female, 62% were White, 5.6% were Asian, 4.0% were Black and 52% were 
Hispanic/Latino. The majority of participants (84%) were seronegative at baseline, and 90% were 
considered at higher risk of progressing severe COVID-19, defined as either individuals aged 65 years 
and older at randomisation or individuals aged < 65 years and having at least one medical condition or 
other factor that placed them at higher risk for progression to severe COVID-19. High risk co-
morbidities included: obesity (BMI ≥ 30) (43%), smoking (current or former) (40%), hypertension
(28%), chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma (12%), diabetes (12%), cardiovascular 
disease (including history of stroke) (9%), immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, 
blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of other 
immunosuppressive medicines) (5%), cancer (4%), chronic kidney disease (2%), or chronic liver 
disease (2%).
At baseline, 88% of patients had WHO clinical progression scale of 2 and 12% had WHO clinical 
progression scale of 3 COVID-19, the median duration of symptoms prior to treatment was 5 days.
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of either severe COVID-19 or death from any cause 
by Day 29, in participants who received treatment within 7 days from symptom onset and were not 
hospitalised at baseline. Severe COVID-19 was defined as characterised by either pneumonia (fever, 
cough, tachypnoea or dyspnoea, and lung infiltrates observed on chest X-ray or lung computed 
tomography scan) or hypoxemia (SpO2 <90% in room air and/or severe respiratory distress) and a 
WHO clinical progression scale score of 5 or higher. EVUSHELD demonstrated a statistically 
significant reduction in severe COVID-19 or death from any cause compared to placebo (Table 5). 
Given the small sample size, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the efficacy in seropositive 
patients.

The relative risk reduction was 67% (95% CI of 31, 84) in non-hospitalised patients dosed within 
5 days of symptom onset (p= 0.002).
The results of the primary composite endpoint were driven by the incidence of severe COVID-19. Up 
to Day 29, 7 deaths had been reported, 3 in the EVUSHELD arm and 4 in the placebo arm. Of the 
7 deaths, 2 were not COVID-19 related. Both of these were in the EVUSHELD arm and contributed to 
the primary composite endpoint.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
EVUSHELD in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis and treatment of 
COVID-19 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of tixagevimab and cilgavimab are comparable, linear and dose-proportional 
between 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab and 1 500 mg of tixagevimab and 1 500 mg of 
cilgavimab following a single intravenous administration. Population PK analysis of data from healthy 
volunteers and patients enrolled in three Phase III studies of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PROVENT), post-exposure prophylaxis (STORMCHASER) and treatment of 
mild-to-moderate COVID-19 (TACKLE), as well as data from five additional Phase I and II studies, 
with doses ranging from 300 mg (150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab) to 600 mg (300 mg 
tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab) intramuscular administration and 300 mg (150 mg tixagevimab 
and 150 mg cilgavimab) to 3 000 mg (1 500 mg tixagevimab and 1 500 mg cilgavimab) intravenous 
administration supports dose proportionality of tixagevimab, cilgavimab and EVUSHELD.
Absorption
Based on population PK modelling, following a single intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 
150 mg cilgavimab the predicted median (90% prediction interval [PI]) maximum serum concentration 
(Cmax) of EVUSHELD was 26.9 µg/mL (90% PI: 12.6, 53.7), the median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 
19 days (90% PI: 5, 45).
After a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab the predicted Cmax of 
EVUSHELD was 53.9 µg/mL (90% PI: 25.2,107.3), which was reached at a median Tmax of 19 days 
(90% PI: 5, 46).
The estimated absolute bioavailability was 67.1% for EVUSHELD, 61.5% for tixagevimab and 65.8% 
for cilgavimab.
Distribution
Based on PK modelling, the central volume of distribution was 3.17 L for tixagevimab and 3.52 L for 
cilgavimab. The peripheral volume of distribution was 1.77 L for tixagevimab and 1.82 L for 
cilgavimab.
Biotransformation
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and component amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG antibodies.
Elimination
The clearance (CL) median (95% CI) was 0.050 (0.049, 0.052) L/day for EVUSHELD, 0.046 (0.044, 
0.047) L/day for tixagevimab and 0.052 (0.049, 0.054) L/day for cilgavimab with interindividual
variability of 43%, 41% and 44% respectively. The estimated population median (5th and 95th
percentile) terminal elimination half-life was 79 (46, 101) days for EVUSHELD, 81 (49, 106) days for 
tixagevimab and 78 (49, 97) days for cilgavimab.
Following a single intramuscular dose of 150 mg tixagevimab and 150 mg cilgavimab, the predicted 
median EVUSHELD serum concentration was 24.5 µg/mL (90% PI: 11.8, 44.8) on Day 29 and 
6.2 µg/mL (90% PI: 1.8, 14.7) on Day 183.
14
Following a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg tixagevimab and 300 mg cilgavimab, the predicted 
median EVUSHELD serum concentration was 49.1 µg/mL (90% PI: 23.6, 89.5) on Day 29 and 
12.5 µg/mL (90% PI: 3.6, 29.3) on Day 183.
There was no clinically relevant difference on the clearance of tixagevimab or cilgavimab between 
participants with COVID-19 enrolled in TACKLE and those enrolled in the prophylaxis studies.
Special populations
Renal impairment
No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are not eliminated intact in the urine, thus renal impairment is not 
expected to significantly affect the exposure of tixagevimab and cilgavimab. Similarly, dialysis is not 
expected to impact the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
Based on population PK analysis, there is no difference in the clearance of tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab in patients with renal impairment (assessed via baseline eGFR and creatine clearance) 
compared to patients with normal renal function. In the population PK model there were insufficient 
participants with severe renal impairment to draw conclusions.
Hepatic impairment
No specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab. The impact of hepatic impairment on the PK of tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab is expected to be low.
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be catabolised by multiple tissues through proteolytic 
degradation into amino acids and recycling into other proteins, therefore hepatic impairment is not 
expected to affect the exposure of tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
Elderly
Of the participants in the pooled PK analysis, 17.6% (N= 871) were 65 years of age or older and 3.2% 
(N= 156) were 75 years of age or older. There is no clinically meaningful difference in the PK of 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab in geriatric subjects (≥ 65 years) compared to younger individuals.
Paediatric population
The PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in individuals < 18 years old has not been evaluated.
Using population PK modelling and simulation, the recommended dosing regimen is expected to result 
in comparable serum exposures of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in adolescents aged 12 years or older 
who weigh at least 40 kg as observed in adults, since adults with similar body weight have been 
included in the prophylaxis and treatment clinical trials.
High body weight
Based on population PK analysis, a decrease in EVUSHELD maximum serum concentration and 
concentration at 6 months was observed with increased body weight. The maximum serum 
concentration and concentration at 6 months in an adult weighing 108 kg (87.5 percentile) were both 
predicted to be approximately 24% lower than in an adult weighing 81 kg (median).
Other special populations
Based on a population PK analysis, sex, age, race, ethnicity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and 
immunocompromise had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
15
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and reproductive toxicology studies have not been conducted with 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab.
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of tissue binding and a single-
dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys including assessment of safety pharmacology and local 
tolerance.
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection
The potential of tixagevimab and cilgavimab to mediate antibody-dependent viral entry was assessed 
in FcγRII-expressing Raji cells co-incubated with recombinant virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2
spike protein, with antibody concentrations at a range of 6.6 nM (1 µg/mL) to 824 pM (125 ng/mL). 
Tixagevimab, cilgavimab and their combination did not mediate entry of pseudovirus into these cells.
The potential for ADE was also evaluated in a non-human primate model of SARS-CoV-2 using 
EVUSHELD. Intravascular administration prior to virus inoculation resulted in a dose-dependent 
improvement in all measured outcomes (total viral RNA in the lungs or nasal mucosae, infectious 
virus levels in the lungs based on TCID50 measurements, and lung injury and pathology based on 
histology measurements). No evidence of enhancement of disease was observed at any dose evaluated, 
including sub-neutralizing doses down to 0.04 mg/kg.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What EVUSHELD is and what it is used for
EVUSHELD is made up of two active substances: tixagevimab and cilgavimab. These are both 
medicines called monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies are proteins that attach to a specific protein 
of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. By attaching to this protein, they prevent the virus 
from entering human cells.
EVUSHELD is used for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 infection in adults
and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg.
EVUSHELD is used to treat adults and adolescents, aged from 12 years and weighing at least 40 kg,
with COVID-19 who:


do not require supplemental oxygen to treat COVID-19, and
are at increased risk for the illness becoming severe based on the evaluation of your doctor.
2. What you need to know before you are given EVUSHELD
You must not be given this medicine

if you are allergic to tixagevimab, cilgavimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine
(listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given EVUSHELD

if you have low numbers of blood platelets (which help blood clotting), any blood clotting 
problems or are taking a medicine to prevent blood clots (an anticoagulant).
if you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after you were given 
EVUSHELD in the past.

29
Tell a doctor, pharmacist or nurse or get medical help immediately:

if you notice any symptoms of a cardiac event, such as:
o chest pain;
o shortness of breath;
o a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or lack of well-being;
o feeling lightheaded or faint.

if you notice any signs of a severe allergic reaction, such as:
o difficulty breathing or swallowing;
o swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat;

Section 4.5 of the SmPC is being updated to include 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

recommendations on the co-administration of Evotaz with 
antiplatelets and corticosteroids. Such recommendations 
are included in Table 1 (Interactions between EVOTAZ and 
other medicinal products). Changes to the Package Leaflet 
(PL) have been included in this procedure accordingly.
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures.
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

REYATAZ and EVOTAZ Product Information. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to the Risk

resistance data of study GS-US-216-0114 submitted 
in the context of the MAA. 
In addition, for clarification purposes, the MAH 
proposed to use the specific designation of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate throughout the EVOTAZ Product 
Information (PI) to differentiate this pharmaceutical 
entity from the tenofovir alafenamide (for which no 
studies with EVOTAZ have been conducted). 
Consequently section 4.5 of the SmPC was updated 
to reflect the expected pharmacokinetic effects of the 
concomitant administration of tenofovir alafenamide 
and EVOTAZ.
Finally, the MAH took this opportunity to implement 
QRD version 10.

submitted for study GS-US-126-114 and show viral 
suppression rates of 71.6% for ATV/co+TVD of 71.6% (53 
of 74 subjects) and of 79.7% for ATV/r+TVD (55 of 69 
subjects). The difference between the two treatment 
groups in the percentage of subjects with virologic success 
at Week 192 was ‒8.0% (95% CI:-22.2% to 6.3%), in line 
with non-inferiority of the two treatments. 
More than 50% of subjects in each treatment arm rolled 
over to other studies after week 144 and before the week 
192 window. Virologic failure and development of resistant 
associated mutations to FTC were slightly higher for the 
COBI-based arm, while the difference was not statistically 
significant. No differences in the changes of both number 
and percentage of CD4 over baseline values were observed.
The full term 204-week data was submitted for study GS-
US-126-105. This extension phase data for study GS-US-
126-105 is also in line with the data for the main study.

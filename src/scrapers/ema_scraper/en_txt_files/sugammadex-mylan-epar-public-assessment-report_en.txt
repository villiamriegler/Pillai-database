2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  centralised  application  concerns  a  generic  application  according  to  article  10(1)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC for Sugammadex Mylan 100mg/ml solution for injection. The originator product is Bridion 
100mg/ml solution for injection first approved in Europe on 25 July 2008 (MAA No: EU/1/08/466/001-
002, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V). 
Sugammadex is a modified gamma cyclodextrin which is a Selective Relaxant Binding Agent. It forms a 
complex  with  the  neuromuscular  blocking  agents  rocuronium  or  vecuronium  in  plasma  and  thereby 
reduces  the  amount  of  neuromuscular  blocking  agent  available  to  bind  to  nicotinic  receptors  in  the 
neuromuscular junction. This results in the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium 
or vecuronium. 
The Applicant has applied for the same indications as the originator:  
-  Reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults. 
- 
For  the  paediatric  population:  sugammadex  is  only  recommended  for  routine  reversal  of 
rocuronium induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.

Polymorphism has not been observed for the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process of sugammadex sodium involves four stages using commercially available 
well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The  dossier  also  included  risk  assessment  on  the potential  presence  of  nitrosamines  impurities  in  the 
active substance was provided.  
The active substance is packaged triple laminated aluminium bag with oxygen absorber, which is lined 
with one black LDPE clear bag with oxygen absorber, layer of clear LDPE bag with silica gel and a layer 
of clear LDPE bag seal with nitrogen blanketing. The three LDPE bags are sealed with plastic liner seal. 
The material which complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  solubility  (Ph.  Eur.), 
identification (IR, HPLC), pH (Ph. Eur.), clarity (UV-Visible), absorbance (UV-Visible), water content (KF), 
sodium content (ICP-OES), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), microbial test (Ph. Eur.), and foreign matter (visual). 
The specification limits for the related substances are justified based on the ICHQ3A. 
It has been adequately justified that no specific limits for elemental impurities are adopted in the active 
substance  specification.  It  has  been  adequately  justified  the  presence/absence  of  tests  and  limits  for 
residual solvents.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately  validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  are  provided.  The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches  of the active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% 
RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines were provided.

The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  identification,  pH,  clarity,  water  content,  assay, 
related substances, microbial limit test, and bacterial endotoxin. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
Results from the accelerated and long-term stability studies revealed no significant changes in any of 
the parameters tested. 
The active substance was also subjected to forced degradation (acid, base, oxidation, heat and light). 
The  results  showed  that  sugammadex  sodium  is  more  sensitive  to  acidic  than  the  basic  pH,  thermal 
stress and is also very sensitive to oxygen.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period, in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as a clear and colourless to slightly yellow sterile, preservative-free 
solution free from visible particles. The finished product is available in 2 mL and 5 mL vials containing 
200 mg and 500 mg of sugammadex, respectively.  
The  finished  product  has  been  developed  as  a  generic  medicinal  product  equivalent  to  the  reference 
medicinal  product,  Bridion  100mg/mL  solution  for  injection  which  is  administered  intravenously  as  a 
single bolus injection. The bolus injection may be given over 10 seconds, into an existing intravenous 
line. Therefore, given this, and the fact that the product contains the same active ingredient and inactive 
ingredients as reference medicinal product, in the same concentration, bioequivalence studies are not 
required for this product . Hence, the pharmaceutical equivalence of the product was established through 
the development studies, including stability studies. 
Since  the  finished  product  is  intended  for  intravenous  administration,  the  applicant  has  adopted 
appropriate limits, in accordance with Ph. Eur., for microbial contamination and endotoxins in the active 
substance. 
As indicated earlier, the proposed excipients are the same as those used in the reference product. All 
excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A risk assessment of the overall finished product manufacturing process was performed to identify the 
high-risk steps that may affect the CQAs of the finished product. For each of these process steps, a risk 
assessment was subsequently conducted to identify potentially high-risk process variables which could 
impact the finished product CQAs. These variables  were thoroughly investigated to better understand 
the  manufacturing  process  and  to  develop  a  control  strategy  to  reduce  the  batch  failure.  Component 
selection,  equipment,  and  manufacturing  were  identified  as  main  focus  areas  of  evaluation  during 
development. Considering the characteristics of the raw materials and the finished product, and based 
on  the  manufacturing  process,  critical  control  points  (CCP's)  and  product  specific  requirements  were 
identified  to  be  monitored  during  manufacturing.  Given  that  the  product  is  to  be  sterile,  autoclave 
suitability studies were carried out to determine whether Sugammadex Injection 100 mg/mL could be 
terminally sterilized. 
CHMP assessment report

During manufacturing process development, it was identified that several equipment components come 
in contact with the product during manufacturing and storage. There are chances of potential chemicals 
from these components leach into the finished product. To address this, a risk assessment to qualitatively 
describe the potential sources of extractables and leachables and justify the choice of equipment was 
conducted. There are multiple components that have the potential to leach unwanted contaminants into 
the finished product solution. In order to evaluate the acceptability for use of these various components 
extractables studies for each of these components were evaluated. The applicant is planning to conduct 
further  extractable  studies  and  a  screening  leachables  study  is  also  planned  to  further  evaluate  any 
potential risk to patient safety from unidentified or partially identified organic compounds. 
The  primary  packaging  is  type  I  clear  glass  vial  closed  with  grey  chlorobutyl  rubber  stoppers  with 
aluminium light blue flip-off seal. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice 
of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site. The manufacturing process consists of 
6 main steps: dispensing, bulk compounding process, filtration, filling and sealing, terminal sterilization 
and visual inspection, following by labelling and secondary packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. 
The finished product is terminally sterilized. The finished product is terminally sterilized using a reference 
condition of the Ph. Eur. 5.1.1 (≥121 °C, ≥15 min in all units) and meets the bioburden requirements. 
The validation report is available at the finished product manufacturing site and available for inspection. 
The vials are depyrogenated in a tunnel as a continuous process integrating the vial washing, followed 
by sterilization/depyrogenation to facilitate further filling & sealing process. The depyrogenation method 
uses a reference Ph. Eur condition.  
The rubber stoppers are sterilized in an autoclave by steam sterilization process. The sterilization method 
uses a reference Ph, Eur. condition of the Ph. Eur.  
The process validation will be performed on first three commercial batch size according to the process 
validation scheme provided. This is acceptable.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: description (visual), identification (HPLC, specific optical rotation), pH (Ph. Eur.), light transmission 
at 650 nm (UV - Visible), color of solution (Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particulate contamination-
subvisible particles (light obscuration), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), extractable 
volume (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), sodium content (ICP-OES), and particulate 
contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
The related substances are determined by a stability indicating validated analytical method. Applicable 
data and rationale supporting the justification for the proposed levels of the impurities in the finished 
product are provided.  
A  risk  assessment  on  elemental  impurities  was  done  based  on  the  information  available  from  the 
respective  vendors  of  the  formulation  ingredients  and  materials  that  come  into  the  contact  with  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/555625/2021

finished product during manufacturing and storage. In addition, three batches of finished product from 
each  fill  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  elemental  impurities.  The  level  of  elemental  impurities 
observed  are  less  than  30%  of  PDE,  option  3  of  ICHQ3D  is  met.  No  further  controls  are  required  for 
monitoring elemental impurities in the finished product specification.  
A  risk  evaluation  concerning  the  potential  presence  of  nitrosamines  impurities  in  the  finished  product 
has been performed considering all suspected  and actual root causes, in line with the “Questions and 
answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article  5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided, it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities  in  the  active  substance  or  the  related  finished  product.  Therefore,  no  additional  control 
measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with  the  ICH  guidelines.  The  reference  standards  used  for  testing  are  the  same  as  for  the  active 
substance and are acceptable. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of the 2 mL vials and three pilot batches 
of the 5 mL vials confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
The  finished  product  is  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through 
traditional final product release testing 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of the 2 mL vials and three pilot batches of the 5 mL vials 
of finished product stored inverted and upright for up to 24 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for: description, identification, pH, light transmission at 650 nm, colour of solution, 
particulate  matter,  osmolality,  bacterial  endotoxins  test,  sterility,  related  Substances,  assay,  sodium 
content, and foreign matter. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Under long term conditions no significant changes have been observed. In addition some samples of the 
finished product were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products  (ICH  Q1B).  The  product  was  found  to  be  stable  when  stored  in  the 
secondary pack and complied with the specification. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  2  years  and  the  storage  recommendation 
store  below  30°C.  Do  not  freeze.  Keep  the  vial  in  the  outer  carton  in  order  to  protect  from  light  as

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The  finished  product  has  been  developed  as  a  generic  of  Bridion  100mg/mL  solution  for  injection. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
Although the original information presented on the potential genotoxic impurities and the nitrosamine 
risk  assessment  was  deemed  incomplete,  and  CHMP  raised  major  objections,  the  applicant  provided 
satisfactory responses and all these issues were considered solved. 
The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the Summary of product characteristics (SmPC) of the reference 
product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as 
the introduction of Sugammadex Mylan manufactured by Mylan Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sugammadex containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
No questions have been raised during the assessment.

2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Sugammadex Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  clinical  overview  on  the  clinical  pharmacology,  efficacy  and  safety  has  been  provided  and  is 
adequate. The clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
Relevant for the assessment is the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Sugammadex Mylan 100 mg/mL is a solution for injection. The reference product is Bridion 100 mg/mL 
solution for injection, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V., a CP product EMEA/H/C/000885.  
No  bioequivalence  study  was  submitted  to  support  the  application.  According  to  Appendix  II  to  the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), bioequivalence studies are 
generally  not  required  if  the  test  product  is  to  be  administered  as  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution 
containing  the  same  active  substance  as  the  currently  approved  product.  This  is  the  case  here. 
Furthermore, both products contain the same excipients. A bioequivalence study is not required. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety is adequate. No bioequivalence 
study was submitted to support the application, this is in accordance with the Appendix II to the Guideline 
on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. No questions were raised during the assessment. 
Sugammadex Mylan is considered essentially similar to Bridion, Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V.

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to the originator Bridion (EMEA/H/C/0885) and the design 
and  layout  to  the  “in-house”  style  Mylan  leaflet  for  Ogivri  (EMEA/H/C/4916).  The  bridging  report 
submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This  application  concerns  a  generic  version  of  Sugammadex  100mg/ml  solution  for  injection.  The 
reference product Bridion is indicated for the treatment of reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced 
by  rocuronium  or  vecuronium  in  adults.  For  the  paediatric  population:  sugammadex  is  only 
recommended for routine reversal of rocuronium induced blockade in children and adolescents aged 2 
to 17 years. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active  substance;  the  applicant’s  clinical  overview  on  these 
clinical  aspects  based  on  information  from  published  literature  was  considered  sufficient.  No 
bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application, this is in accordance with the Appendix 
II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus

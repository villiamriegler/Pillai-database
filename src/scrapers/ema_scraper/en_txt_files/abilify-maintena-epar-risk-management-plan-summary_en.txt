Summary of Risk Management Plan for Aripiprazole 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for aripiprazole. The RMP details important 
risks of aripiprazole, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about aripiprazole's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Aripiprazole's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how aripiprazole should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for aripiprazole should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
aripiprazole’s RMP. 
I: The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Aripiprazole (Abilify) is authorised for schizophrenia in adults and in adolescents aged 15 years and 
older,  moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and the prevention of a new manic 
episode in adults who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes 
responded to aripiprazole treatment, treatment up to 12 weeks of moderate to severe manic 
episodes in Bipolar I Disorder in adolescents aged 13 years and older and for rapid control of 
agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic 
episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains aripiprazole as the active substance and it is given orally or 
intramuscularly. Forms and strengths are as follows: 
•  Abilify tablets: 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg 
•  Abilify orally disintegrating tablets: 3 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 24 
mg and 30 mg 
•  Abilify oral solution: 1 mg/mL 
•  Abilify powder: 10 mg aripiprazole/1 g powder 
•  Abilify solution for injection (immediate release) for IM use: 7.5 mg/mL 
Aripiprazole (Abilify Maintena) is authorised for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adult 
patients stabilised with oral aripiprazole (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains aripiprazole 
as the active substance and it is given intramuscularly in 300 mg/vial or pre-filled dual chamber 
syringe and 400 mg/vial or pre-filled dual chamber syringe. 
Further information about the evaluation of aripiprazoles’s benefits can be found in aripiprazole’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage

II: Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks  
Important risks of aripiprazole, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about aripiprazole’s risks, are outlined below. 
 
 
 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
II.A: A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of aripiprazole are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of aripiprazole. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

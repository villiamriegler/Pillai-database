2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Open-label exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin 
barrier function in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic 
dermatitis - LPS16764 
Description 
Study LPS16764 (PELISTAD) was a phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of 
dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients aged between ≥6 and <12 years old with 
moderate-to-severe AD with a healthy participant cohort as a reference comparator. It was conducted 
in 2 sites in the United States and 1 site in United Kingdom from 26 February 2021 (first participant 
first visit) through 30 November 2022 (last participant last visit). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Atopic dermatitis participants were enrolled based on the following criteria: 
• Patients with AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria (4) at least 1 year before 
screening. 
• Investigator global assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 (for US patients) or IGA ≥4 (for EU patients) at 
screening (on the 0-4 scale) depending on approved label indication in the country. 
• Patients with moderate-to-severe AD eligible to be treated with dupilumab according to product label. 
• Patients with AD had active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs, with severity for lesion 
erythema or edema/papulation ≥2 at screening on the 0-3 scale of the Individual Signs Score (ISS). 
• Atopic dermatitis participants had a non-lesional (normal looking) skin area 4 cm from the edge of 
the lesional area. If unable to identify non-lesional skin 4 cm from the lesional area, it was acceptable 
to identify normal looking skin as close to the lesion as possible. Age, gender, and other demography 
and participant characteristics at baseline were matched between the AD participant cohort and the

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

healthy participant cohort for the safety population. A total of 48 participants (24 participants in the AD 
participant cohort and 24 participants in the healthy participant cohort) were planned to be enrolled to 
achieve 40 evaluable participants. A total of 43 participants were enrolled in the study, among them 41 
participants were screened successfully, including 23 participants with moderate to severe AD and 18 
healthy participants. The intent-to-treat (ITT), the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and safety 
populations included all 41 participants. 
In the AD participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 7.0 years, and ranged 
from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (15 [65.2%]) were male. The majority of the 
participants (16 [69.6%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 19.60 
(3.71) kg/m2. In the healthy participant cohort, the median age of the participants at baseline was 8.0 
years, and ranged from 6 to 11 years. More than half of the participants (10 [55.6%]) were male. Half 
of the participants (9 [50%]) were white. The mean (SD) BMI of the participants at baseline was 18.44 
(3.14) kg/m2. 
Study design 
Study LPS16764 was a Phase 4, open-label, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on 
skin barrier function in pediatric participants aged between ≥6 and <12 years old with moderate-to-
severe AD with a healthy participant cohort not receiving any drug or placebo as a reference 
comparator. 
Male and female participants with moderate-to-severe AD were enrolled. Healthy participants matched 
for age, gender, location of skin area, and study site served as reference comparators for skin barrier 
function. 
The study intervention included dupilumab 200 mg and 300 mg in a prefilled syringe for subcutaneous 
administration. AD participants with baseline 15 kg ≤ body weight <30 kg received a SC loading dose 
of dupilumab 600 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 300 mg) on Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q4W SC 
dosing of dupilumab 300 mg from Week 4 to Week 12. AD participants with baseline 30 kg ≤ body 
weight <60 kg received a SC loading dose of dupilumab 400 mg (2 injections of dupilumab 200 mg) on 
Day 1 (Week 0), followed by Q2W SC dosing of dupilumab 200 mg from Week 2 to Week 14. 
The duration of the treatment period was 16 weeks. The maximum study duration per participant was 
32 weeks.  
The study comprised: 
• Screening period 1 (Day -28 to Day -1): Participants were evaluated according to inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. 
• Baseline visit (Week 0, Day 1): Participants who remain eligible were enrolled.  
• A 16-week treatment phase for participants with AD and a 16-week observation period for healthy 
volunteers. 
• A 12-week follow-up period.

Objectives and outcomes 
The objectives of this study (see Table 2) were to assess the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin 
barrier function measured by transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and measurement of lipids, proteins, 
and gene expression associated with skin barrier function from skin tape stripping (STS) in participants 
with moderate to severe AD. In addition, this study evaluated the relationship between skin barrier 
function and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well 
as high-definition standard photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas. 
Transepidermal water loss is commonly used for physiologic assessments of skin barrier function. In 
addition to basal TEWL to assess the undisturbed permeability of the skin barrier, TEWL measurements 
were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier function and integrity. 
The STS technique uses a standardized tape for removing the epidermis layer by layer. The 
advantages of this technique are as follows: it is noninvasive, causes no pain in participants, and 
leaves no scars. With this technique, it was possible to follow reactions within the same skin area over 
time and to study precisely in which depth of the epidermis the different cellular and molecular 
cutaneous markers were located. Through these assessments, the study explored the interplay 
between skin barrier function kinetics, clinical disease severity, and therapeutic response. 
Transepidermal water loss is the loss of water that passes from inside a body through the epidermis. A 
higher value of TEWL means more water is passing through the skin, such as in AD patients. It is 
influenced by many environmental and individual factors, including age, gender, race, anatomical 
region, skin temperature, environmental conditions, season, smoking status, measurement technique, 
and many others. Therefore, it was important to include a ‘normal’ TEWL from an age-, gender-, 
targeted lesion area-, and study site-matched healthy participant cohort assessed at the same time 
under the same measurement conditions on the same anatomical region with reference thresholds of 
skin barrier function evaluation indicating pathological relevance.

Sample size 
Sample size for this exploratory study was based on medical/clinical judgment and is consistent with 
the sample size from similar studies in the literature (Danby et al., 2011). No formal sample size 
calculation was performed. TEWL data collected in similar settings as planned for this study were not 
available, i.e., TEWL values after 5 STS, and pre- and post-dupilumab treatment are unknown. 
Allowing for drop-out rate of 15%, a total of approximately 24 pediatric patients with moderate-to-
severe AD will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients, ie, patients with no major or critical 
deviations related to IMP and/or TEWL measurements, for whom the TEWL data for primary analysis: 
ie, TEWL at baseline and Week 16, are considered sufficient and interpretable. An approximately equal 
number of age, gender, location of targeted lesion area and site matched healthy volunteers serving as

a reference comparator cohort will be enrolled. Drop-out rate in healthy volunteers is expected to be 
minimal. Any drop-out healthy volunteer for whom the matched patient is considered as evaluable will 
not be replaced. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Changes to the conduct of the study 
There were no changes in the conduct of the study. 
Statistical Methods 
A detailed description of participant accountability including number of participants by analysis 
population, screen failure of participants with the reasons for screen failure, participants who did not 
complete the study observation period along with the main reason for permanent treatment 
discontinuation, and participants who requested permanent treatment discontinuation were generated 
by cohort. Continuous variables (age, weight) and qualitative variables (gender, race, and body mass 
index) were summarized by cohort and by descriptive statistics (summary tables). The efficacy 
evaluation was based on a review of the individual values (graphics), descriptive statistics (summary 
tables, graphics), and where applicable, exploratory statistical analysis. All efficacy analyses were 
performed using the ITT and mITT population. The safety evaluation was based on a review of vital 
signs parameters and reported adverse events. All the safety analyses were performed using the 
safety population. When applicable, results were reported by cohort and overall.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The applicant submitted efficacy and safety results from study LPS16764, a phase 4, open-label, 
exploratory study to evaluate the effect of dupilumab on skin barrier function in pediatric patients aged 
between ≥6 and <12 years old with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Atopic dermatitis is 
associated with skin barrier defects, which has, amongst others, implications for the immune function 
of the skin. The purpose of this phase 4 study was the analysis of the effect of dupilumab treatment on 
skin-barrier function in adolescent and adult AD patients, i.e. on (patho-)physiological features such as

transepidermal water loss (TEWL), epidermal activation, epidermal lipids and proteins, etc. using skin 
rape stripping (STS) to measure skin barrier function and integrity. In addition, disease activity was 
measured by clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes, as well as high-definition standard 
photography from the targeted lesional and non-lesional areas.  
Overall, 43 children were enrolled in the study, two of the participants were excluded from the efficacy 
and safety population due to screen failures, thus 41 subjects were treated; 23 patients were assigned 
to the dupilumab group, and 18 healthy volunteers (HV) to the control group which served as 
reference comparator for the skin barrier assessment parameters. The participants were enrolled if 
they had an AD diagnosis according to Hanifin and Rajka criteria at least 1 year before screening, 
moderate-to-severe symptoms, and active lesions on the upper limbs or lower limbs with Individual 
Signs Score ≥2 at screening. The demographic characteristics were balanced between both groups. 
The median age was 7 years in the AD group with a median disease duration of 7 years. Accordingly, 
most patients in the AD participant cohort had prior medications such as topical corticosteroids and 
other dermatological preparations, systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Further 
medications included ophthalmologicals, drugs for the treatment of obstructive airway disease, and 
nasal preparations indicating concomitant type 2 inflammatory diseases. To establish similar conditions 
for the subsequent analysis of dupilumab’s treatment effect on the skin barrier, individuals were 
matched with AD patients for age, gender, examined skin area and study site. Study subjects must 
have had a treatment gap of at least 6 months or must have been treatment-naïve. 
The patients assigned to the dupilumab group were treated according to product label. The duration of 
the open-label treatment or observation period was 16 weeks, and the maximum study duration per 
participant was 32 weeks.  
The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of dupilumab treatment on skin barrier function 
measured by TEWL and measurement of lipids, proteins, and gene expression associated with skin 
barrier function from STS in the participants. In addition, this study evaluated the relationship between 
skin barrier function, integrity and disease activity measured by clinical assessments and patient-
reported outcomes. The measurement of TEWL to quantify the skin barrier functionality as well as non-
invasive techniques such as STS to determine TEWL are commonly used in clinical trials. Here, 5-20 
STS over a period of 16 weeks were performed in lesional and non-lesional skin areas in AD patients 
under dupilumab treatment and for comparison in HV. The STS time points are acceptable as the onset 
of dupilumab’s effect was observed after 2 treatment weeks in clinical trials. 
41 participants were included in the efficacy population (ITT) and safety population. TEWL 
measurements were combined with skin barrier perturbation using STS to measure skin barrier 
function and integrity. The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in TEWL after 
5 STS assessed on lesional skin at Week 16 in AD participants. After 5 STS on lesional skin in AD 
participants the TEWL was reduced by 37.5% at week 16, and also on non-lesional skin of AD patients 
as demonstrated by results of the secondary endpoints. In contrast, no changes were observed on 
healthy skin. As demonstrated before, dupilumab had a positive effect on further clinical and patient-
reported outcomes EASI, ISS, POEM, skin pain NRS, sleep disturbance NRS, worst itch NRS, and CDLQ 
total scores. Major protocol deviations that are deemed to have impacted efficacy analyses were 
reported in 31 participants (20 participants in the AD participant cohort, and 11 participants in the 
healthy participant cohort) due to used prohibited therapies or missing TEWL assessment not 
performed as defined in the protocol. It is unclear if adolescent patients were involved. To what extent 
these medications have influenced TEWL measurements, is not discussed by the MAH.  
The safety results are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. Overall, no new safety 
findings were identified in this study. No amendments of the product information were introduced by 
the applicant which is supported.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The efficacy results indicate that TEWL of lesional skin was gradually reduced for the total AD ITT 
population over a period of 16 treatment weeks compared with the TEWL of healthy volunteers 
suggesting an improved skin barrier. Treatment benefits also included improvements in quality of life. 
However, the relatively high amount of concomitant AD medication and major protocol deviations are 
supposed to have influenced the results. Regarding the limited analysed patient number, the generated 
data are considered to be supportive information. The collected safety data are consistent with the 
known safety profile. It is concurred that no amendment of the PI is indicated.

Summary of risk management plan for Alofisel 
(DARVADSTROCEL)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Alofisel. The RMP details important risks of
Alofisel, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Alofisel's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Alofisel's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Alofisel should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Alofisel should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  of  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Alofisel's RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Alofisel
is  authorised  for the  treatment  of  complex  perianal  fistulas  in  adult  patients  with  non-
active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease, when fistulas have shown an inadequate response to at 
least  one  conventional  or  biologic  therapy (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indication).  It  contains
DARVADSTROCEL as the active substance and it is given INTRALESIONALLY.
Further information about the evaluation of Alofisel’s benefits can be found in Alofisel’s EPAR, including 
in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website under the medicine’s webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/alofisel
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important  risks  of Alofisel,  together  with  measures  to  minimise such  risks  and  the proposed studies 
for learning more about Alofisel's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:



Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (e.g.  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In the case of Alofisel, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  - include  PSUR  statement  only  if  product  has  PSUR 
requirements so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Alofisel is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Alofisel are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of Alofisel. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and 
needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal 
product  that  is  currently  missing  and  needs  to  be  collected  (e.g.  on  the  long-term  use  of  the 
medicine);

II.C. Post-authorisation development plan
II.C.1. Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation
The following studies are conditions of the marketing authorisation:
ADMIRE-CD II (Cx601-0303): Phase III Study
Purpose  of  the  study: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Alofisel compared to placebo for the 
treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in patients with Crohn’s disease at Week 24 with a follow-up 
period up to 52 weeks.
II.C.2. Other studies in post-authorisation development plan
ADMIRE-CD II (Cx601-0303) Long Term Extension Study 
including 
Purpose  of  the  study: To  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  darvadstrocel
adverse events of special interest (immunogenicity, tumorigenicity and ectopic tissue formation). The 
study  will  also  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  darvadstrocel  treatment  on  fistula  remission,  major 
fistula-related events (hospitalizations and surgeries).
Retreatment PASS
Purpose  of  the  study:  The  overall  objective  of  the  study  is  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
repeat administration of darvadstrocel in patients with Crohn’s disease and complex perianal fistula.
European multi-database linkage study:  An observational European multi-database linkage study 
to quantify malignancy rates in Crohn’s disease patients with complex perianal fistula patients treated 
with darvadstrocel.

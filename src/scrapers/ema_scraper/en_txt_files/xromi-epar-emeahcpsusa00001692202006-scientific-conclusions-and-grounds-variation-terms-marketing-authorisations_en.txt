Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for hydroxycarbamide (for centrally 
authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
Based on ESCORT-HU results, toxic ranges for neutrophils  counts were agreed to be lowered to 1500 
cells/ μL (threshold for neutropenia) and intervals for blood cells monitoring  at initiation  of treatment 
extended to  one month.   
Additionally, it was agreed to remove the recommendation for continuous follow-up of the growth  of 
treated children and adolescents. This was based on positive outcome of growth in children treated with 
hydroxycarbamide from ESCORT-HU and because the caution about “Continuous  follow-up of the growth 
of treated children and adolescents is recommended” was deemed not necessary as it is expected from 
routine medical practice.  
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the  scientific conclusions for hydroxycarbamide (for centrally authorised product only) the 
CHMP  is of the opinion that  the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing 
hydroxycarbamide (for centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

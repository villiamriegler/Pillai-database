Introduction of a new Pharmacovigilance System

Annex II 
The MAH has introduced a new pharmacovigilance system 
(TEVA DDPS Version 10), including a new Qualified 
person for Pharmacovigilance. 
Annex II.B has also been updated with the latest 
wording as per October 2010 CHMP procedural 
announcement. 
C.I.8.a - Introduction of a new Pharmacovigilance 
system - which has not been assessed by the 
relevant NCA/EMA for another product of the same 
MAH 
used by TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which will be 
applied for the product Eporatio.  The detailed description 
of this pharmacovigilance system includes information 
pertaining to the qualified person responsible for 
pharmacovigilance, the global structure of the 
pharmacovigilance organisation, company procedures 
relating to pharmacovigilance activities, global safety 
databases, links with other organisations, training and the 
quality management system. The MAH has also taken the 
opportunity to update Annex II.B with the latest wording as 
per October 2010 CHMP procedural announcement.

Additionally the MAH took this opportunity to make

A patient-level data analysis has also been performed on 
more than 13,900 cancer patients (chemo-, radio-
,chemoradio-, or no therapy) participating in 53 controlled 
clinical trials involving several epoetins. Meta-analysis of 
overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point estimate

of 1.06 in favour of controls (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12; 53 trials 
and 13,933 patients) and for the cancer patients receiving 
chemotherapy, the overall survival hazard ratio was 1.04 
(95% CI: 0.97, 1.11; 38 trials and 10,441 patients). Meta-
analyses also indicate consistently a significantly increased 
relative risk of thromboembolic events in cancer patients 
receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (see section 
4.4). 
To update Section 4.4 "Special Warnings and Precautions of 
Use" of the SmPC with the following wording: 
A paradoxical decrease in haemoglobin and development of 
severe anaemia associated with low reticulocyte counts 
should prompt to discontinue treatment with epoetin and 
perform anti-erythropoietin antibody testing. Cases have 
been reported in patients with hepatitis C treated with 
interferon and ribavirin, when epoetins are used 
concomitantly. Epoetins are not approved in the 
management of anaemia associated with hepatitis C.

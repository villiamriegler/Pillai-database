Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
EU RMP V33.4: Based on feedback received from the advisory group on classification of 
post-authorisation studies (CPAS) the PRAC requested to remove the PK study to evaluate 
systemic exposure in 8 mg aflibercept bilaterally treated patients as PASS from the EU RMP. 
It was considered that safety and efficacy are exploratory endpoints in this study and as the 
number of participants was calculated based on the primary outcome (PK) the proposed PK 
study sample size is expected to provide limited information on the safety and efficacy of 8mg 
aflibercept use in patients. Therefore, the CPAS proposed the PK study as a “recommended 
(REC) post authorization measure” and not as a PAES or a PASS category 3 study. Therefore, 
in this RMP version 33.4 the PK study was removed from the EU RMP. 
The safety associated with the 8 mg aflibercept bilateral administration will be monitored in 
the PSUR. 
In RMP version 33.3 Annex 6 was updated as requested by EMA in the 8 mg aflibercept 
submission procedure (EMEA/H/C/002392/X/0084/G). In addition, the study synopsis of the 
PK study to evaluate exposure in 8 mg aflibercept bilaterally treated patients was added to 
Annex 3. 
With RMP version 33.2, the study design of the category 3 Eylea 114.3 mg/ml PK study to 
evaluate exposure in 8 mg bilaterally treated patients was amended and Annex 6 was updated 
as requested by EMA in the 8 mg aflibercept submission procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/002392/X/0084/G). 
With RMP version 33.1 the new 8 mg dose (114.3 mg/ml) aflibercept study program is 
integrated.

Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of 
human VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) receptor 1 and 
2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. 
Aflibercept is a specific blocker that binds and inactivates vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the related molecule, placental 
growth factor (PlGF). 
Summary of mode of action 
It is designed to interfere with the increase in vascular permeability and 
growth of pathological new blood vessels that lead to retinal oedema, 
ischemia and haemorrhage in diseases accompanied by ocular 
neovascularization. 
Important information about its composition: 
Aflibercept is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by 
recombinant DNA technology.

SI.2 
Epidemiology of the disease 
SI.2.1  Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
Characteristics of target indication 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a medical condition which usually affects older 
adults and results in a loss of vision in the centre of the visual field (the macula) because of 
damage to the retina. It is a leading cause of severe central visual loss in older people (1, 2). 
With increased life expectancy, the proportion of people over 65 years of age is expected to 
double by 2030 (1) and the prevalence and burden of AMD is, therefore, expected to increase. 
The stages of AMD are categorized as early, in which visual symptoms are inconspicuous, 
and late, in which severe loss of vision is usual. Late AMD has "dry" and "wet" forms (3). It 
is the advanced stages of each of these which are responsible for severe vision loss. Dry AMD 
may eventually lead to a more severe form called “geographic atrophy” (GA), which is 
characterized by deposits known as drusen and by atrophy of the photoreceptors in the 
macula. The first sign of wet or neovascular (exudative) AMD (in the following referred to as 
wet AMD) is serous or haemorrhagic fluid that causes the neuroretina to detach from Bruch's 
membrane. The fluid originates from a subretinal neovascular membrane. The detachment

(Aflibercept)

Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
disturbs the fine arrangement of the photoreceptors and causes image distortion and vision 
loss (3, 4). 
Incidence of target indication 
A population-based study in Wisconsin, United States (US), the Beaver Dam Eye Study (5), 
reported a 15-year cumulative incidence for advanced wet AMD of 2.0%. The risk increased 
with age: in persons aged 43 to 54 years the 15-year cumulative incidence was 0.4% and rose 
to 2.9% for individuals aged 75 to 86 years. 
A 5% sample of US Medicare medical claims data from the Standard Analytical File 
(n = 1,041,009) was used to develop a longitudinal study cohort by the Wilmer 
Ophthalmological Institute investigators. The 3-year (1995-1998) incidence of wet AMD 
ranged between 0.37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.38) and 1.14% (95% CI, 
1.12-1.16) depending on the ascertained criteria chosen (6). 
A population-based study, the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (7), reported a 4-year incidence 
of early AMD of 7.5% and advanced AMD of 0.2%. The overall 4-year progression of any 
AMD in either eye was 9.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3, 10.1). Increasing age was 
associated with higher rates of progression (test of trend, p < 0.0001), ranging from 6.2% in 
people aged 40 to 49 years at baseline to 21.7% in those over 80 years of age. Age-specific 
incidence and progression of AMD in Latinos were lower than in non-Hispanic whites. 
In the Netherlands the estimated yearly AMD incidence was 0.1% (8). 
In Germany approximately 300,000 new cases of AMD are diagnosed each year, generating a 
yearly incidence of 0.4% (9). 
A Nigerian study to determine the incidence of age-related macular degeneration in Nigerian 
people 50 years of age and older showed that the incidence of AMD between 1997 and 2004 
was 3.2% (256 out of 7,966 patients) (10). 
Prevalence of target indication 
The overall prevalence of wet AMD and/or geographic atrophy (advanced dry AMD) in the 
US population among people 40 years and older is estimated to be 1.47% (95% CI, 1.38% to 
1.55%), with 1.75 million citizens having AMD.  
In the Baltimore Eye Survey (11) among people 40 years of age and older, the prevalence of 
wet AMD was 0.61% in whites and 0.11% in blacks. When directly adjusting for age 
(minimum variance method), the rate among whites was 1.82%. 
In a Medicare study (12) among people 65 years of age and older, the prevalence of wet AMD 
was 2.2% (2.3% in women [65% of wet AMD population] versus 1.7% in men and 2.3% in 
whites versus 1.2% in blacks; p < 0.01 for both gender and race differences). 
In Europe (the EUREYE study), the prevalence of any AMD or wet AMD in either eye was 
reported as 3.32% and 2.29%, respectively. The corresponding percentages for AMD and 
wet AMD were reported in men versus women as follows: ages 65-69 years, 0.90% vs. 
1.03%, 0.38% vs. 0.92%, ages 70-74 years, 1.97% vs. 2.36%, 1.40% vs. 1.42%, ages 
75-79 years, 4.07% vs. 3.15%, 2.63% vs. 2.17%, ages 80 and older, 6.94% vs. 15.00%, 5.56% 
vs. 10.50%, and in ages 65 and older, 2.49% vs. 4.00%, 1.69% vs. 2.78% (13).

Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
In Germany, about 1 to 4.5 million people are affected by AMD in a population of about 
80 million people (1.25%-5.6%) (9). 
The prevalence of AMD increases dramatically with age, with more than 15% of the white 
women older than 80 years having wet AMD and/or geographic atrophy. More than 7 million 
individuals have drusen measuring 125 µm or larger and are, therefore, at substantial risk of 
developing AMD. Owing to the rapidly aging population, the number of persons having 
AMD is likely to increase by 50% to 2.95 million in 2020. 
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is more prevalent among white than among 
black persons (14). A systematic review and meta-analysis by Kawasaki et al. showed that 
among Asians 40 to 79 years of age, the age-specific prevalence of late AMD was comparable 
with that reported from white populations, but early AMD signs were less common among 
Asians (15). 
Mortality in target indication 
A 2005 report from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) (16) showed that during a 
median follow-up of 6.5 years, 534 of 4,753 participants (11%) died. Participants with 
advanced AMD had increased mortality compared to participants with few, if any, drusen 
(relative risk [RR] 1.41; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.86). Advanced AMD was significantly associated 
with cardiovascular deaths (RR 1.92; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.12). 
Potential health risk 
The neovascular form of AMD is responsible for severe vision loss associated with the 
disease in 90% of the cases (4, 17, 18). As demonstrated in several studies (19, 20) this 
condition has serious implications on quality of life and is associated with increased risk of 
falls and depression. Wet AMD patients also reported that the need for assistance with daily 
activities was more than 10 times greater compared to controls (26.5% vs. 2.2%; p<0.0001) 
and the prevalence of falls was 3 times that of the control group (13.3% vs.4.3%; p=0.031). 
Similar results were reported in Canada (20), and in a multicentre European study (18). In a 
12-month prospective study in Vancouver (21), Canada community-dwelling women 
aged ≥70 years with wet AMD (n=114) had a significantly greater number of falls and almost 
twice the risk of injurious falls compared to women of the same age from that community 
without the condition who had recent normal eye exam (n=132). A mean of 0.37 injurious 
falls per person-year were experienced among wet AMD participants, compared to 
0.16 injurious falls per person-year among non-wet AMD participants (p=0.006). The 
age-adjusted incidence rate for injurious falls, for individuals with wet AMD was 1.77 
(95% CI 1.07 to 3.02) times higher than in those without the condition. 
In a Nigerian study to determine ocular morbidity associated with age-related macular 
degeneration in the Nigerian population (N=256), 34 patients (13.3%) were bilaterally blind 
and 130 (50.8%) had bilateral visual impairment. Of the blind patients 13 (38.3%) had wet 
AMD and 6 (17.7%) had geographic atrophy. The authors concluded that AMD was the cause 
of blindness in 7.4% of the patient population (10). 
Demographic profile of target population 
The target population as studied by some investigators is subjects 40 years of age and older 
with rates of disease increasing with increasing age (5, 22, 23). 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
Ethnic variations have been described suggesting a higher prevalence among whites (24). 
Age-related macular degeneration is also more prevalent in older women compared to older 
men (5, 25). 
On average, people with AMD are more likely to be elderly white women with hypertension, 
diabetes, or history of MI compared to people without the condition (12). In the large 
non-interventional study (NIS) OCEAN, in which patients treated with ranibizumab in a 
real-world setting are being observed in Germany (N=5,606 overall), the cohort of subjects 
with wet AMD (n=3,614) had a mean age of 77.9 ± 8.2 years, 61.2% were females, 22.3% 
had a medical history of arterial hypertension, 5.5% of MI, 4.0% of stroke or apoplexy, and 
0.1% of transient ischemic attack (TIA) (26). A similar demographic structure was found in a 
retrospective, comparative, non-randomized cohort study based on patients’ real-world data 
from electronic medical record databases in Australia and the United Kingdom (UK). The 
mean age in the Australian (N=570) and UK cohort (N=2,755) was 78.5 ± 6.8 and 78.0 ± 8.1 
years, respectively, and 57.8% and 63.7%, respectively, were women (27). 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) 
SI.2.2 
Characteristics of target indication 
Abruptly decreased vision and a "blood and thunder" retina are classic signs of CRVO, a 
retinal vascular disease first described by Leibreich in 1855 and Michel in 1878. Dilated 
tortuous retinal veins, optic disc hyperaemia and oedema, 360-degree intraretinal 
haemorrhages, and often massive central oedema lead to an abrupt decrease in visual acuity 
(28). 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is an important cause of moderate to severe visual loss 
in older persons (29) and a serious risk factor for macular edema in CRVO (30). The 
pathogenesis of macular edema in CRVO remains uncertain but is likely multifactorial (31). 
Thrombosis of the central retinal vein results in venous stasis, leading to disc swelling, diffuse 
nerve fibre layer and pre-retinal haemorrhage, macular edema and cotton wool spots. There 
are two types of CRVO: non-ischemic and ischemic. The former has a better prognosis than 
the latter, which is often complicated by iris neovascularization and neovascular glaucoma. 
Usually CRVO occurs in the elderly with a peak of incidence in the sixth to seventh decade 
and is frequently associated with systemic vascular conditions including atherosclerosis, 
diabetes, and hypertension (31, 32). 
Results of a small study (n=30) by Turello et al. 2010 (33) showed that 84.2% of patients over 
50 years and 90.9% of patients under 50 years with CRVO were found to have one or more 
haemostasis-related risk factors. Other small studies could not consistently confirm an 
important role of impaired haemostasis as a major systemic risk factor for RVO (34, 35). 
However, in patients without acquired risk factors, screening analyses for thrombophilia were 
recommended (36). To date, classic systemic risk factors that are commonly considered to be 
the cause of retinal vein occlusion (RVO, central and branch) are: smoking, diabetes mellitus 
and arterial hypertension. 
A longitudinal study aimed to identify risk factors associated with CRVO among 1,302 
managed care enrollees (from 2001 to 2009) ≥55 years of age. Cox regression analysis was 
used to determine the hazard of CRVO. After adjustment for known confounders, blacks had 
a 58% increased risk of CRVO compared with whites (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.25–1.99), and 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
women had a 25% decreased risk of CRVO compared with men (HR, 0.75; 
95% CI, 0.66– 0.85) (37). 
In a population-based, cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors 
of retinal vein occlusion in the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 
(2008–2012), the following risk factors were found to be significantly associated with any 
RVO (i.e., CRVO or BRVO) in multivariate logistic regression analyses after adjusting for all 
potential factors: advanced age (OR=1.72, 95%-CI: [1.27; 2.34]), hypertension (OR=2.56, 
95%-CI: [1.31; 5.08]), history of stroke (OR=2.08, 95%-CI: [1.01; 4.45]), and hyper-
cholesterolemia (OR=1.84, 95%-CI: [1.01; 3.35]) (38). 
Incidence of target indication 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) remains a common cause of unilateral visual loss (39). 
After diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusions, both branch and central, are the second 
most common cause of visual loss from retinal vascular disorders (40). 
Based on the 2008 world population, and on the prevalence rates ranging from 0.1% to 0.5% 
of the middle aged to older groups (32), (41), it was estimated, that 2.5 million adults were 
affected by CRVO worldwide (42). 
In the Wisconsin Beaver Dam Eye Study in the US (4,926 residents, 43 to 84 years of age at 
baseline from 1990 to 1995), the 5-year cumulative incidence of CRVO was 0.2% (32) and 
the 15-year cumulative incidences was 0.5% (43). The incidence increased with age affecting 
1.3% of those aged 65 to 74 years or older at Baseline (43). 
In Australia, the 10-year cumulative incidence reported by the Blue Mountain Eye Study (44), 
3,654 Australian residents 49 years of age and older from 1992 to 2004) for CRVO was 0.4%, 
which is similar to the cumulative incidence reported in the Beaver Dam Eye Study. 
Based on the before-mentioned 2 studies, Petrella et.al. estimated the incidence of CRVO to 
be 0.04%/year in adults aged ≥45 years in Caucasian populations (45). 
The 9-year cumulative incidence (1998-2007) of CRVO in a Japanese population was 0.3% 
and it significantly increased with increasing age (46). 
Prevalence of target indication 
In the combined populations of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (n=12,642; 
mean age, 60 years) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (n = 2,824; mean age, 79 years), the 
prevalence of retinal vein occlusion was 0.3% (n=39) (47). 
Combined individual-level data from 15 major population-based studies around the world 
estimated the prevalence of CRVO. Overall, the authors collated data for 68,751 participants 
from 15 studies from the US, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Of these participants, 43.7% were 
male, 48.4% were white, 27.1% were Asian, 17.2% were Hispanic, and 7.2% were black. The 
age- and sex-standardized prevalence (per 1,000 persons) was 0.65 in the pooled analysis. The 
standardized prevalence rates for CRVO in individual studies varied from 0.04 per 1,000 in 
the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) to 1.59 per 1,000 in the Blue Mountains Eye Study 
(42). 
A longitudinal study aimed at determining the incidence of CRVO among managed-care 
enrollees (from 2001 to 2009) ≥55 years of age. Of 494,165 enrollees, 1,302 (0.26%) were 
diagnosed with CRVO over 5.4 ± 1.8 years (37). 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
In the Hisayama study (N=1,775) of Japanese people 40 years of age and older, the 
prevalence of CRVO was 2 per 1,000 people (48). 
In a population-based, cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors 
of retinal vein occlusion in the Korean National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 
(2008–2012), the crude prevalence (expressed as weighted estimate in %) of CRVO among 
the 25,765 evaluable participants with ophthalmic examination was <0.1% (38). 
Mortality in target indication 
In some clinical studies, overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality in CRVO patients 
have been reported to be similar to patients from the general US population without the 
condition (49, 50). A pooled data analysis from two US population-based cohort studies, the 
Beaver Dam Eye and the Blue Mountains Eye Study, evaluated cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular mortality in patients with and without RVO (central or branch) (51). After 
adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, glaucoma, and 
study site, RVO was not associated with cardiovascular-related mortality (Hazard ratio [HR] 
1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.8) or cerebrovascular-related mortality (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.1) 
among participants of all ages. However, in persons under 70 years of age, baseline RVO was 
associated with higher cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.2–5.2). 
Potential health risk 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) may lead to moderate to severe vision loss (32) and 
with it to reduced quality of life and risks of injuries. A study which utilized the 25-item 
National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) found that patients with 
CRVO had a clinically relevant decrease in their vision-related quality of life as they scored 
significantly lower than patients without ocular disease (52). Responses correlated most 
strongly with visual acuity in the better-seeing eye, the number of systemic medical 
conditions and patients’ opinions about their general health. 
Demographic profile of target population 
CRVO frequency is commonly similar in men and women and occurs for the most part in 
persons over the age of 65 years (32, 42).  
In the large NIS OCEAN, in which patients treated with ranibizumab in a real-world setting 
are being observed in Germany (N=5,606 overall), the cohort of subjects with CRVO (n=121) 
had a mean age of 70.3 ± 11.5 years, and 52.9% of CRVO subjects were females (26). 
The findings from the Hisayama study (48) suggest that the prevalence of RVO (central and 
branch) is higher in Japanese than in other Asians or Caucasians. 
Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) 
SI.2.3 
Characteristics of target indication 
Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) is a venous occlusion that can occur in any of the 
branches of the central retinal vein and is considered to be the most common form of retinal 
vein occlusions (RVOs) (53). In BRVO, abnormal arteriovenous crossing with vein 
compression, degenerative changes of the vessel wall and abnormal haematological factors 
constitute the primary mechanism of vessel occlusion. The first case of BRVO was described 
by Leber in 1877 (54). BRVO is classified according to its anatomical location either as 
major, when one of the major branch veins draining one of the retinal quadrants is involved,

or as macular, when a small venous vessel draining a specific sector of the macula is occluded 
(55). In the superotemporal quadrant the incidence of BRVO is higher as compared to the 
other quadrants. A tendency to a greater number of arteriovenous (AV) crossing at the site has 
been suggested to be causative (53). In 66% of eyes with BRVO, there is occlusion of the 
major branch in the superotemporal quadrant followed by 22%–43% of eyes with occlusion of 
the major branch in the inferotemporal quadrant (56). 
Generally, risk factors for BRVO are consistent with those identified for CRVO (see also 
section on CRVO above). Risk factors for BRVO are eyes with focal retinal arteriolar 
narrowing or glaucoma history, a history of smoking, migraine headaches, asthma and 
increase in systolic blood pressure (57), as well as, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, 
thrombophilia, hypercoagulation, systemic vasculitis, and inflammatory diseases (53). 
Hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease have been postulated to cause retinal 
arteriosclerotic changes, especially at the arteriovenous crossings, resulting in RVO through 
endothelial cell damage and thrombosis (58). Arteriosclerosis resulting in arteriolar 
insufficiency has been described as a possible underlying etiologic factor resulting in BRVO 
(57, 59). 
Incidence of target indication 
The Beaver Dam Eye study (Wisconsin United States of America [USA]) (57) was a 
population-based (age 43-86 years) study where BRVO and CRVO were detected (if present) 
at baseline in 1988-90 (n = 4,068) and at three 5-year follow-up examinations (ending in 
2005), by grading 30° colour fundus photographs. 
The 5-year incidence of BRVO in the Beaver Dam eye study was 0.6% (6/1,000). The 
incidence by age group was: 
Age 43-54:   0.2% (2/1,000) 
Age 55-64: 
0.5% (5/1,000) 
Age 65-74: 
1.3% (13/1,000) 
Age 75-86: 
0.9% (9/1,000) (32). 
The 15-year cumulative incidence of BRVO was 18 per 1,000 (1.8%, 95% CI, 1.4%-2.2%) 
and varied with age reaching the highest rates (2.9%) at ages 65-74. The frequencies were 
similar in men and women (age-adjusted frequencies, 1.5% vs. 2.1%, respectively, p=0.55). 
The 15 years incidence (accounting for competing risk of death) by age groups was: 
Age 43-54: 
1% (10/1,000) 
Age 55-64: 
1.5% (15/1,000) 
Age 65-74: 
2.9% (29/1,000) 
Age 75-86: 
2.3% (23/1,000) (57). 
In right eyes as compared with left eyes, the overall 15-year cumulative incidence was similar 
(1.0% vs. 0.9%, respectively; p=0.70) (57). 
The Blue Mountain Eye Study (Australia) was a population-based cohort study of a suburban 
Australian population of ages 49 years and older at baseline (1992-94). The surviving baseline

participants were invited to attend follow-up examinations after 5 years (1997-1999) and after 
10 years (2002-2004). The 10-year cumulative incidence of BRVO was 1.2% (60). 
Prevalence of target indication 
A recent meta-analysis (42) pooled data from 15 studies totaling 68,751 participants (age 
range 30-101 years) from several countries. The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of 
BRVO in 11 studies that assessed ≥2 fundus fields of both eyes (n=49,869) was 4.4 per 1,000 
people with a range between 0.26 and 6.85 per 1,000 people. The age and sex standardized 
prevalence of BRVO by the 15 individual studies representing over 8 countries is displayed in

In a population-based, cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence and associated factors

Mortality in target indication 
In a prospective study in Denmark (61) to assess BRVO as a prognostic marker of mortality, 
cases of BRVO were identified from a background population of 5.4 million and compared 
for risk of mortality with the non-BRVO segment of this population. Standardized mortality 
rates were calculated. 
A total of 329 BRVO patients (173 women, 156 men) born between 1902 and 1956 were 
identified. They were 39 to 91 years old when diagnosed between 1973 and 1998. Follow-up 
was concluded on 08 JUL 2004, when 144 deaths were recorded among the BRVO patients 
(74 women, 70 men), compared with an expected number of 145.5 deaths in the background 
population. The standardized mortality rate was 0.99 (95%-CI: 0.84-1.16). Thus, the overall 
mortality rate of the BRVO population was almost identical to the background population. 
Stratified analyses revealed no significant effect of age, gender, or time of diagnosis (61). 
The study investigators noted that an association between BRVO and 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular risk factors has previously been documented in cross-sectional 
studies. The outcome in this longitudinal study may have been influenced by interventions 
instituted after the diagnosis of BRVO was made and by preferential survival before the 
diagnosis of BRVO of the more fit patients with the necessary precursor condition of having 
arteriovenous nicking, which is more prevalent in subjects with diabetes and hypertension 
(61). 
A Danish case-control study (62) with prospective follow-up data from Danish national 
registries covering 80% of the Danish population (4.4 million) was performed to study BRVO 
comorbidities. A total of 1,168 patients with photographically verified branch retinal vein 
occlusion and 116,800 controls aged ≥40 years when the occlusion was diagnosed in the 
corresponding case were selected. The mortality hazard ratio adjusted for sex and year of

diagnosis and with age as the underlying time scale, was similar in cases and controls (hazard 
ratio 0.94, 0.85 to 1.05; p=0.30). 
Potential health risk 
BRVO is a component of retinal vein occlusion, which is the second most common retinal 
vascular disorder after diabetic retinopathy and is considered to be an important cause of 
visual loss (63). 
Most BRVO cases (particularly major BRVO) result in retinal ischemia, predominantly 
affecting macular retinal ganglion cells, which are most vulnerable to ischemic damage, and 
pigmentary degeneration and/or epiretinal membrane that may develop in the foveal region 
secondary to prolonged macular edema (64). 
Complications of BRVO include macular edema, ischemic maculopathy, retinal 
neovascularization, macroaneurysmal formation, retinal telangiectasia, retinal detachment, 
and vitreous haemorrhage (53, 56, 65, 66). The most common complications are macular 
edema, followed by retinal neovascularization, vitreous haemorrhage, or retinal detachment 
(53). 
The average reduction in visual acuity for ischemic BRVO is 20/50 and for non-ischemic 
BRVO it is 20/60. In the retina, acute BRVO presents with flame-shaped haemorrhages, dot 
and blot haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, hard exudates, oedema, and dilated tortuous veins 
in the affected eye. In the chronic phase after absorption of intraretinal haemorrhage, 
morphological signs are more subtle and include capillary non-perfusion, dilatation of 
capillaries, microaneurysms, telangiectatic vessels, and collateral vessel formation, in addition 
to the previously mentioned complications (53). 
A Danish case control study found that after a BRVO diagnosis, patients had an increased risk 
of developing arterial hypertension (incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.57), diabetes 
(1.51, 1.17 to 2.04), congestive heart failure (1.41, 1.12 to 1.68), and cerebrovascular disease 
(1.49, 1.27 to 1.76) compared to the non-BRVO reference group (62). 
Demographic profile of target population 
Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) affects most frequently patients at the age of 50 years 
and older, and the sex distribution is similar or includes a slightly higher female population 
(42, 53, 57). 
In population-based research that studied BRVO, the racial distribution, BRVO prevalence, 
and population mean age was as summarized in Table SI.3.

Overall, the prevalence findings of these studies suggested that BRVO occurs more frequently 
and possibly at younger age among Asians and Hispanics compared to Whites. 
A retrospective study of 95 patients with retinal vein occlusion was carried out to determine 
the clinical presentation and pattern of distribution of the condition in the local Malaysian 
population. There was no significant difference in the sex distribution of the subjects. When 
comparing racial distribution between BRVO and CRVO patients, in the BRVO group, 40% 
were Indians, 29% Malays, and 31% Chinese. For CRVO in contrast, the Indians made up 
only 20% of the cases, the Malays 38% and the Chinese 43% (67). 
In the large NIS OCEAN, in which patients treated with ranibizumab in a real-world setting 
are being observed in Germany (N=5,606 overall), the cohort of subjects with BRVO (n=204) 
had a mean age of 71.2 ± 10.0 years, and 58.3% of BRVO subjects were females (26). 
SI.2.4  Myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV) 
Characteristics of target indication 
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common vision-threatening complication of 
high myopia. The exact pathogenesis of myopic CNV remains unclear (68). In myopic 
populations, elongation of the eyeball and mechanical stress in the eye may induce choroidal 
ischemia followed by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and overlying retina

and subsequent growth factor release (69). These changes may lead to the formation of breaks 
in Bruch’s membrane (lacquer cracks), RPE atrophy, and subsequent CNV formation (70). 
Lacquer cracks and chorioretinal atrophic areas are predictive of an unfavourable course in 
pathologic myopia and are associated with macular atrophy and CNV (71). Blood vessels 
from the underlying choriocapillaris may grow through the ruptured Bruch´s membrane and 
under the retina. The appearance of lacquer cracks and the presence of high levels of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and low levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor 
(PEDF) (72), are probably involved in the development of myopic CNV (70). 
Myopic CNV usually appears at an earlier age than that associated with age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) and the diameter of the lesion is usually smaller; however, myopic CNV 
is subfoveal in up to 89% of cases (70). 
Myopic CNV can be classified into two groups: Type 1 is formed by well delineated lesions 
with early hyperfluorescence and little leakage in late phases of the angiogram. Type 2 is 
formed by lesions with early hyperfluorescence and leakage causing a neuroepithelial 
detachment (70). 
Incidence of target indication 
Although a number of epidemiology studies in general and high myopia (> minus 5, 
> minus 6 or > minus 8 dioptres) are available, little is known regarding the prevalence or 
incidence of pathologic myopia. 
Among Caucasians in Australia and the United States, approximately 20% of the population 
has (simple) myopia. In many Asian countries, however, the incidence exceeds 20%. In the 
Tajimi Study (Sawada et al. 2008, (73)), myopia among Asians was found to be roughly 
2.5 times greater than among Caucasians, and the incidence of high myopia, defined as 
> minus 6 dioptres, is approximately 2.3 greater. 
Ohno-Matsui reviewed the medical records of 218 consecutive Japanese patients (325 eyes) 
with myopic fundus changes in the macula. During an average follow-up of 130 months of the 
325 highly myopic eyes, 33 eyes (10.2%) developed myopic CNV. The incidence was higher 
(34.8%) among the fellow eyes of patients with pre-existing CNV than among eyes of 
patients without pre-existing CNV (6.1%). Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) developed in 
3.7% of patients with diffuse chorioretinal atrophy, in 20.0% with patchy atrophy, and in 
29.4% with lacquer cracks (74). 
In a retrospective cohort study using data from an administrative claims database in Taiwan 
(JAN 2009 to DEC 2011), the cumulative annual incidence of myopic CNV rose from 
11.9/100,000 (95%-CI: [11.4; 12.4]) in 2010 to 12.5/100,000 (95%-CI: [12.0; 13.0]) in 2011 
(75). 
Prevalence of target indication 
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the most common vision threatening complication of 
high myopia (68). The prevalence of choroidal neovascularization in people with highly 
myopic eyes was estimated at 5% of eyes (69, 70). 
In a cohort examined by Lai et al. in 2008 (76), 11 % of highly myopic asymptomatic eyes 
with ≤-6 D were found to have posterior pole lesions, and more than 50% had peripheral 
retinal lesions. In France, a retrospective study of 363 patients under 50 years of age who

EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
were referred to a tertiary care ophthalmology department found that 62% of CNV was 
secondary to pathologic myopia (77). 
A retrospective cohort study using data from an administrative claims database in Taiwan 
(JAN 2009 to DEC 2011) (75) reported the prevalence of myopic CNV to be 0.017% 
(n=9,068 myopic CNV patients identified over a total of 15,011.98 person-years of 
follow-up). 
Mortality in target indication 
No information was identified. 
Potential health risk 
The long-term prognosis for natural progression of myopic CNV over time is extremely poor. 
It is believed that, after the onset of CNV, chorioretinal atrophy expands outward from around 
the periphery of the CNV in the process of gradual shrinkage of the CNV, and that this is the 
primary cause of the decline in visual acuity and progression of central scotoma (78). 
Yoshida et al. found that approximately 90% of their patients had a visual acuity of 20/200 or 
less after 5 years, and almost all (96.3%) had a visual acuity of 20/200 after 10 years (79). 
Degenerative myopia is estimated to be the seventh most common cause of blindness in adults 
in the US, is present in about 0.5% of the general population in Europe, and is estimated to 
represent 2% of all types of myopia (80). Caution should be exercised in interpreting these 
figures, however, as they date from the last century, and more recent publications are not 
available. 
Myopic CNV usually appears at an earlier age than that associated with age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) and the diameter of the lesion is usually smaller (70, 81). Serous retinal 
detachment is a risk as well with associated haemorrhages (81). 
It has been estimated that 36% to 82% of eyes with CNV show lacquer cracks (69, 82). 
Demographic profile of target population 
Myopic CNV affects both men and women and occurs in young adults as well as those over 
50 years of age. 
In various studies of myopic CNV the population age ranged between 12 and 93 years and 
was younger on average compared to AMD populations (83). In the Japanese study by 
Yoshida et al., the age of the patient population ranged from 7 to 82 years (mean 48.3 
[SD 14.8]) (79). In a retrospective cohort study using data from an administrative claims 
database in Taiwan (JAN 2009 to DEC 2011; n=9,068 myopic CNV patients identified) the 
mean age was 52.6 ± 16.5 years, and 39.0% were male (75). 
CNV occurs in approximately 5% of eyes with pathologic myopia. Ethnic origin seems to 
influence the likelihood of developing pathologic myopia, with prevalence being higher in 
Asian populations and lower in African and Pacific island groups (83, 84). There is strong 
evidence that pathologic myopia has a genetic factor, based on studies in twins and in families 
with pathologic myopia. Pathologic myopia appears to be a multi-factorial and polygenic 
disorder that is genetically heterogeneous. The simultaneous development of CNV in both 
eyes is uncommon (83).

Diabetic macular edema (DME) 
SI.2.5 
Characteristics of target indication 
Diabetic macular edema is the result of retinal microvascular changes that occur in patients 
with diabetes mellitus. Thickening of the basement membrane and reduction in the number of 
pericytes is believed to lead to increased permeability and incompetence of retinal 
vasculature. This compromise of the blood-retinal barrier leads to leakage of plasma 
constituents into the surrounding retina, resulting in retinal oedema and vision loss. The 
hypoxic state achieved through this mechanism can also stimulate the production of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (85, 86). The role of VEGF appears to be central, since it 
increases microvascular permeability (87, 88). 
The ETDRS group defined DME, based on stereoscopic fundus photography, as an increase 
in retinal thickness at or within 1 disk diameter of the foveal centre. This increase in thickness 
may be focal or diffuse, and hard exudates or macular cysts may or may not be present as well 
(ETDRS Group 1985). The term "clinically significant macular edema" (CSME) was 
introduced to characterize the severity of disease, and for treatment guidelines. Clinically 
significant macular edema meets at least 1 of the following 3 criteria: retinal thickening at or 
within 500 μm from the centre of the macula; hard exudates at or within 500 μm from the 
center of the macula associated with thickening of the adjacent retina; an area or areas of 
retinal thickening at least 1 disk area in size, at least part of which is within 1 disk diameter of 
the centre of the macula (89). 
Incidence of target indication 
- USA: 
The 25-year cumulative incidence of DME in people with type I diabetes in the Wisconsin 
Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) was 29% (90). The 10-year 
incidence of DME in the WESDR was 20.1% in type I diabetics; 25.4% in insulin-treated 
type II diabetics, and 13.9% in non-insulin treated type II diabetics (91). 
The 4-year incidence of DME in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study was 5.4% (38/699) (92). 
- European Union (EU) and USA: 
In a review of the literature, Chen et al. 2010 (93) provided a figure describing the increasing 
incidence of DME and CSDME over time in diabetic patients (see following figure). This 
information indicates a considerably higher DME risk in the US compared to EU countries, 
which continued to increase over time from the diagnosis of diabetes. The incidence rates of 
DME/CSDME in the overall diabetic population by reported countries were: 
Sweden 1999 (94): 
1-year CSDME: 
2.3% 
UK 2002 (95):  
2-year CSDME:

countries. In WESDR, the annual incidence of DME was found to be lower in the last 
follow-up period compared with earlier follow-up periods (2.3% from 1980–2 to 1984–6, 
2.1% from 1984–6 to 1990–2, 2.3% from 1990–2 to 1994–6, and 0.9% from 1994–6 to 
2005-7) (90). The authors attributed the decline to better glycaemic control (i.e., decreasing 
glycosylated haemoglobin), decreasing mean arterial blood pressure level, and earlier 
treatment of hypertension. A clinic-based study in Denmark also showed a decline in the 
incidence of DME in patients over time. The incidence after 15 years of diabetes duration was 
11% and 12% for patients diagnosed in 1965–1969 and 1970–1974, respectively, while only 
5% for patients diagnosed in 1975–1979 (90). 
Prevalence of target indication 
In 2010, of an estimated 285 million people worldwide with diabetes, over one-third had signs 
of diabetic retinopathy (DR), and a third of these are afflicted with vision-threatening 
retinopathy, defined as severe non-proliferative DR or diabetic macular edema (DME) (97). 
The global prevalence of diabetes for all age groups is expected to increase from 2.8% in 
2000 to 4.4% in 2030. The total number of people with diabetes is predicted to rise to 300 
million by the year 2025, with the most significant increases in developing countries, due to 
population growth, aging, obesity and sedentary lifestyles (98). 
The prevalence of DME is strongly related to the duration of diabetes. In the USA, an 
estimated 29% of adults with diabetes have DR and 3% have DME (99). In a cross-sectional 
study of 778 individuals with ages 45 to 85 years with diabetes, participating in the 
 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) (100), the prevalence of any retinopathy was 
33.2% and macular edema 9.0%. When looking at racial distribution, the prevalence of 
macular edema was significantly higher in Blacks (11.1%) and Hispanics (10.7%) than in 
Whites (2.7%) and Chinese (8.9%) (p=0.007). Data from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study 
of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) (101) showed that after 15 years of known diabetes, the 
prevalence of DME was 18% in patients with type I diabetes, 20% in patients with type II 
diabetes who are taking insulin, and 12% in patients with type II diabetes who do not take 
insulin. 
Outside of the USA, rates in diabetic populations have been reported as follows: 
Spain: A population-based study of 8,187 type II diabetes and 488 type I diabetes patients in 
Spain in 2008 reported a yearly prevalence of 5.7% for macular edema in type I diabetes and 
6.4% in type II diabetes (102). 
India: The overall prevalence of macular edema in a population-based cross-sectional study 
(Sankara Nethralaya Diabetic Retinopathy Epidemiology and Molecular Genetics, (103) was 
31.76% (95%-CI: 26.04 – 37.47). The prevalence of macular edema was higher in persons 
with known diabetes than in those with newly diagnosed diabetes (32.9% vs. 13.3%). 
Australia: In a population-based study of 2,177 diabetic adults aged ≥25 years in 42 randomly 
selected areas of Australia, 15.3% had retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema was present in 
1.2% of these patients with retinopathy (n=4) (104). 
South Asia: In a community-based cross-sectional study (2009) involving 10 general 
practices; 1,035 patients with type 2 diabetes were studied: 421 of South Asian and 614 of 
white European ethnicity. The prevalence of DME was 12% (105, 106). 
Rural China: In a cross-sectional study of 6,830 Han Chinese aged 30 years and older from 
13 villages, 387 participants (6.9%) were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The overall 
prevalence of macular edema in the diabetic population was 5.2% and of CSDME 3.5% (107). 
A pooled analysis of 35 studies (1980–2008) (97) provided data from 22,896 individuals with 
diabetes. The overall prevalence for DME was 6.81% (6.74–6.89). Studies from the USA, 
Australia, Europe, and Asia were included. In the pooled data, 52% were female, 44.4% were 
Caucasian, 30.9% were Asian, 13.9% were Hispanic, and 8.9% were African American. The 
mean age was 58.1 years (range 3–97), median diabetes duration was 7.9 years (interquartile 
range [IQR] 3–16). The prevalence of DME in the different studies ranged between 54% 
(49%, 59%) in the ARIC study (USA) and 15.19% (14.17%, 16.21%) in the EDC study 
(USA). 
The World Health Organization estimates that 346 million people worldwide have diabetes, 
and this is expected to rise as the number of people with diabetes has doubled over the last 
3 decades (108). Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular complication 
of diabetes and is a major cause of visual impairment (109-112). In the US, it is estimated that 
about 28% of subjects 40 years and older with diabetes have DR, and 4.4% have 
vision-threatening DR (99). Outside the US, the estimates of diabetic patients who have 
DR range from 18% (India) to almost 50% in western European countries (103, 112, 113). 
The rate of vision-threatening DR outside the US ranges from 5.3% to 10% (113, 114).

Mortality in target indication 
A 20-years follow-up of the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, 
WESDR (115) showed that clinically significant DME decreased survival in people with 
older onset (diagnosed at age >30) diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio [HR] 1.27, 95%-CI 1.01 to 
1.61) compared to people in the older age group with diabetes but without clinically 
significant macular edema. Clinically significant DME in WESDR was also associated with 
increased all-cause and ischemic heart disease mortality in older-onset diabetic patients (HR, 
1.55; 95%-CI, 1.25-1.92; and HR, 1.56; 95%-CI, 1.15–2.13, respectively) compared to people 
in the older age group with diabetes but without clinically significant macular edema, when 
adjusting for age and gender. After controlling for other risk factors, the association remained 
significant for ischemic heart disease mortality (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.07–2.35; p=0.02) among 
those taking insulin. 
In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) (116), type I and type II diabetic 
retinopathy patients had an increased risk for all-cause mortality compared to none/mild 
non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients, mostly due to cardiovascular disease 
(55%-56%). A multivariable analysis controlling for demographic, cardiovascular, and insulin 
intake variables, still showed increased mortality in diabetics due to macrovascular disease, 
proteinuria, increased serum creatinine, ulceration, amputation, and reduced visual acuity. 
Potential health risk 
In the WESDR study, clinically significant DME was associated with higher risk of ischemic 
heart disease in people with older onset diabetes who were taking insulin (HR 1.58, 95%-CI 
1.07 to 2.35). Stroke and ischemic heart disease were not significantly associated with this 
condition in those not talking insulin (115). Also, in the WESDR, univariate analysis showed 
that the incidence of DME was associated with male sex, more severe diabetic retinopathy, 
higher glycosylated haemoglobin, proteinuria, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
and more pack-years of cigarette smoking. Multivariate analyses showed that the incidence of 
DME was related to higher baseline glycosylated haemoglobin (HR per 1% 1.17; 95%-CI, 
1.10–1.25; p=0.001) and higher systolic blood pressure (HR per 10 mmHg 1.15; 95%-CI, 
1.04–1.26; p=0.004) and marginally to proteinuria (HR 1.43; 95%-CI, 0.99–2.08; p=0.06) 
(90). 
A clinic-based study (Schepens Eye research Institute, Harvard, USA) (117) investigated the 
systemic and ocular factors associated with diffuse macular edema in patients with diabetic 
retinopathy (DR) in 160 DR patients. The risk of developing diffuse macular edema was 
3.2 times greater in patients with high blood pressure (HBP) (95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.5 to 6.9). Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) had a higher prevalence of diffuse 
(58.0%) than focal (26.0%) or no maculopathy (16.0%) (p=0.01). The odds for developing 
diffuse macular edema were 3.4 times greater in patients with vitreomacular adhesion 
(95%-CI, 1.15 to 13.30) than in those with complete posterior vitreoretinal attachment or 
vitreoretinal separation. The odds for development of diffuse macular edema were 7.7 times 
greater (95%-CI, 3.12 to 19.12) in patients with proliferative DR (PDR) in comparison with 
those with non-PDR (NPDR). 
Demographic profile of target population 
The target population is adults with type I or type II diabetes who have developed DME as a 
sequelae of diabetic retinopathy. Racial variations exist: In the third National Health and

Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
Nutrition Examination Survey in the USA, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 46% 
higher in blacks and 84% higher in Mexican Americans than in Whites with diabetes (118). 
In the large NIS OCEAN, in which patients treated with ranibizumab in a real-world setting 
are being observed in Germany (N=5,606 overall), the cohort of subjects with DME 
(n=1,211) had a mean age of 67.6 ± 10.9 years, and 41.9% of DME subjects were female. The 
majority of subjects (77.3%) suffered from T2DM; 9.6% had a medical history of T1DM 
(26). 
In the WESDR, univariate analyses found that the incidence of DME was associated with 
male sex, more severe diabetic retinopathy, higher glycosylated haemoglobin, proteinuria, 
higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and more pack-years of cigarette smoking. 
Multivariate analyses showed that the incidence of DME was related to higher baseline 
glycosylated haemoglobin (HR per 1% 1.17; 95%-CI, 1.10–1.25; p=0.001) and higher systolic 
blood pressure (HR per 10 mmHg 1.15; 95%-CI, 1.04–1.26; p=0.004) and marginally to 
proteinuria (HR 1.43; 95% CI, 0.99–2.08; p=0.06) (90). 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
SI.2.6 
Characteristics of target indication  
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a condition characterized by the cessation of eye 
development and disrupted neurovascular growth of the retina (119). It primarily affects 
preterm infants born at gestational age (GA) below 32 weeks and with very low birth weight 
(VLBW), i.e., ≤1,500g, and leads to an increased risk of visual impairment and blindness. 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) occurs in two phases. In phase I of ROP, the period from 
birth until about postmenstrual age (PMA) 30 weeks, retinal vascularization is inhibited 
because of hyperoxia and loss of the nutrients and growth factors provided at the 
maternal-foetal interface. Suppression of blood vessel growth and hypoxia occurs as the 
poorly vascularized retina matures and metabolic demand increases. Phase II results from 
prolonged hypoxia in the retina, which stimulates retinal neovascularization through increased 
expression of oxygen-regulated factors such as erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF). Proliferation of new blood vessels that poorly perfuse the retina and 
are leaky leads to fibrous scar formation and retinal detachment (119). 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is described in a standardized manner using the 
International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ICROP) system (120). This 
method gives information on the location of retinal involvement (zone I – central circle, 
zone II – mid-peripheral ring, or zone III – peripheral ring), the extent of circumferential 
disease (in number of clock hours), as illustrated in Figure SI.2, the severity of the disease 
(from stage 1 through 5, depending on the morphological appearance), and the presence of 
Plus disease (venous dilatation and arteriolar tortuosity of the posterior retinal vessels in at 
least 2 quadrants and indicating more aggressive course at any stage). A subtype called 
aggressive posterior ROP (AP-ROP) is an uncommon, rapidly progressing, severe form of 
ROP, characterized by posterior location, prominence of Plus disease, with extremely intense 
vascular activation and shows fast progression over a few days to advanced stages if 
untreated. AP-ROP is typically seen in zone I but may occur in posterior zone II (120, 121). 
ROP has also been divided into “threshold” (defined as 5 contiguous or 8 total clock hours of 
stage 3 in zone I or zone II with plus disease) and “prethreshold” disease (defined as any ROP 
in zone I that was less than threshold, or in zone II stage 2 with plus disease, or zone II stage 3

disease without plus disease, or zone II stage 3 with plus disease but fewer than five 
contiguous or eight cumulative clock hours) to guide treatment decisions (121). Recently, in 
the Early Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity Randomized Trial (ETROP), researchers 
redefined the indications for treatment and the terms “pre-threshold ROP” and “threshold 
ROP”, they have been replaced with “type 1 ROP” (aggressive, treatment requiring) and “type 
2 ROP” (more indolent, less aggressive), respectively (122).

RE: right eye; LE: left eye 
Prevalence of target indication 
Prevalence estimates of ROP from population-based studies vary among countries even if 
similar neonatal intensive care facilities are available. This variation might be partially 
accounted for by differences in the proportion of infants at high risk of ROP who survive 
when born at an early gestational age (GA); in Sweden 11.5% of survivors were born in 
weeks 22-23, compared with 0%-6% in other studies (119). The estimated worldwide number 
of preterm infants developing ROP in 2010 was 184,700 (uncertainty range 169,600 – 
214,500); severe ROP requiring treatment was 53,800 (28,800 – 85,000); blindness due to 
ROP was 20,000 (15,500 – 27,200); and mild or moderate visual impairment due to ROP was 
12,300 (8,300 – 18,400) (123). Observed variations in reported rates of ROP may be 
explained by differences in quality of care i.e., wide variations in reported rates seen in 
NICUs, even in high income countries including varying approaches oxygen delivery and 
monitoring (123). 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) screening coverage and screening criteria also vary among 
countries further contributing to different estimates. In most countries preterm infants with 
birth weight (BW) < 1,500 grams or GA < 32 weeks are screened for ROP (Sweden and 
Netherlands GA 29 weeks; Canada, USA and UK with GA 30 weeks; Germany 31 weeks) 
(124). Selected infants with higher BW or GA may also undergo screening if considered high 
risk by the clinician, including requiring cardiorespiratory support, hypotension requiring 
inotropic treatment, receiving oxygen supplementation for more than a few days or receiving 
oxygen without saturation monitoring (121, 122). Screening ultimately aims at prompt case 
detection and optimal treatment for ROP, thereby reducing the severity and overall burden of 
childhood blindness (125).

Incidence of target indication 
About 10% to 11% of newborn infants are born preterm (<37 GA weeks) (119, 126). In 
Europe this proportion varies among countries from 5.4 % to 12% in 2015 (127). Among 
premature infants screened for ROP, the incidence of ROP ranges from 25.2% to 36%, with 
the rate increasing with decreasing preterm infant GA and BW (123).The wide range in 
incidence of any ROP, severe ROP (sROP) and treated ROP reported in different studies 
(Table SI.4) is likely due to differences in GA of infant populations, premature survival rates, 
availability of neonatal care (119) and ascertainment bias, due to subjective interpretation of 
the retina and differences in clinical practice across countries (128). Among the 37,653 
premature infants <27 weeks GA screened for ROP in the International Network for 
Evaluating Outcomes (iNeo), the rates of ROP ranged from 25.2% to 91%, and treatment 
varied between 4.3% and 30.4% in the 10 participating countries (128). Pooled analyses from 
80 studies reporting on population-based incidence of ROP from 2000 to 2010 found that 
21.8% (95% CI: 16.6–27.0%) of all survivors <32 week GA in countries with neonatal 
mortality rate (NMR) < 5, and 36.5% (95% CI: 31.8–41.4%) in countries with NMR ≥ 5 
developed some degree of ROP. These results suggest that the incidence of ROP is higher in 
low-middle income countries, than in countries with better neonatal care (123).

Neonates born very preterm (< 32 weeks GA) and VLBW (BW <1,500g) are at increased risk 
for mortality and life-long disability (128). The survival of preterm infants improves as 
gestational age increases. As showed in Table SI.5, there has been noticeable improvement in 
the survival of extremely premature infants since the 1990s. The continuous increase in the 
survival of the immature infants might contribute to the increasing incidence of ROP (and of 
the frequency of treatment)(132). In an analysis using the SwissNeoNet registry, mortality 
rate dropped from 100% at 22 weeks GA to below 10% on premature infants 27 weeks GA 
and older (136). In the iNeo collaboration the overall mortality rate of very preterm and very 
low birth weight infants before discharge was 10% (5% in Japan; between 6% and 10% in 
Canada, Australia/New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UKNC; 14% in Israel; and 
17% in Spain) between 2007 and 2010 (128). The variation in mortality across countries 
could be the result of organization of perinatal health care delivery, population characteristics, 
case definitions, ascertainment, data quality and reliability, and health care processes 
involved.

ROP is the most common avoidable cause of childhood blindness globally (143). The 
prevalence of blindness caused by severe ROP in developed nations ranges between 3%-13% 
and in various moderately developed nations estimates are >20% (144, 145). Approximately 
400-600 cases of blindness due to severe ROP are estimated to occur in the United States each 
year (119, 146). Complications of ROP involve visual disorders including strabismus, 
amblyopia, high refractive errors and cataracts. If left untreated, severe ROP can lead to 
increased risk of myopia, retinal detachment, long-term visual impairment, and blindness

(119). However, approximately 90% of infants with ROP have mild forms that regress 
without treatment. Most non-proliferative ROP regresses without treatment; nevertheless even 
non-proliferative disease is associated with visual deficits since preterm birth itself has lasting 
effects on the developing visual system (119). Severe ROP in very low-birth-weight neonates 
is associated with increased risk of nonvisual impairment at age of 5 years, including motor 
impairment, cognitive impairment, and severe hearing loss (147).  
Demographic profile 
ROP most frequently affects premature infants with extremely low BW and with 
GA < 28 weeks (119, 146). Some studies have reported a lower risk of severe ROP in 
premature infants of African descent compared with other ethnic groups, and a higher risk in 
those of south Asian descent (123, 148). An analysis conducted in the iNeo collaboration 
among 48,087 premature infants with 24 to 27 weeks found that male sex, lower GA, lower 
BW, and delivery by caesarean section were associated with the occurrence of severe ROP 
requiring treatment, whereas the use of antenatal corticosteroids and multiple births were not 
(128). Other risk factors for ROP include severe respiratory distress syndrome, anaemia, 
neonatal sepsis, thrombocytopenia, multiple blood transfusions and apnoea (149). 
Furthermore, being small for gestational age (weight below the 10th percentile for the GA) or 
having low weight gain proportion (i.e., weight gain less than 50% of the birth weight in the 
first 6 weeks of life) are also associated with ROP (149-151).

Concomitant medication(s) in the target population 
SI.3.1  Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) is approved in the EU and US for the treatment of wet AMD 
Therapeutic options apart from Eylea to treat wet AMD include other IVT anti-VEGF 
therapies such as Macugen® (pegaptanib), Lucentis® (ranibizumab; approved), conbercept 
(approved in the People's Republic of China), or bevacizumab (currently off-label), Beovu® 
(brolucizumab, approved), Vabysmo® (faricimab, approved in US, Japan, EU, Australia, 
Canada and UK in 2022), Susvimo® (ranibizumab port delivery system, approved in US, 
Australia and UK, MAA under assessment by European Medicine Agency [EMA]) and 
photodynamic therapy in combination with verteporfin as photosensitizer. To date, intravitreal 
injections of anti-VEGF drugs have been the gold standard for the treatment of CNV 
secondary to AMD (152). 
Eylea is administered as monotherapy; no systematic experience in terms of possible 
interactions with these alternative treatment approaches is currently available.

(ranibizumab; approved), or bevacizumab (currently off-label), IVT-applied corticosteroids 
such as dexamethasone (Ozurdex®) or triamcinolone acetate (Triesence®, Trivaris®), and 
panretinal photocoagulation (in the event of disease progression to anterior segment 
neovascularization).

Macular grid laser photocoagulation is considered to be the standard of care in BRVO since 
the mid 80’s (63). Although grid laser photocoagulation showed benefits in a sizeable 
proportion of patients with perfused BRVO, in some patients poor vision persisted despite 
treatment (153). One principal concern with laser photocoagulation is, that the laser would 
cause sudden damage of the retina through coagulation, which would be an important factor 
for permanent VA reduction. So especially in the presence of macular ischemia, effects of 
grid laser photocoagulation may be limited (153). The relatively low frequency of vision gain 
and delayed vision improvement following grid laser photocoagulation for BRVO, has 
prompted interest in other treatment modalities (for an overview see below and (154)). 
Two different glucocorticoid drugs have been studied following intravitreal (IVT) 
administration, (preservative-free) triamcinolone acetonide and, more recently, 
dexamethasone implants (Ozurdex®). For IVT triamcinolone acetonide results of the 
SCORE study (155) suggest that for macular edema secondary to BRVO it is not more 
effective than the use of macular grid laser photocoagulation alone. A combination treatment 
showed a higher risk of adverse events and is therefore not recommended. The authors of the 
SCORE study group concluded that grid laser photocoagulation would still be the standard of 
care for macular edema secondary to BRVO. The sustained-release IVT dexamethasone 
implant (Ozurdex®) received approvals for the treatment of macular edema secondary to RVO 
from the US FDA in 2009 and in the EU in 2010. Two pivotal studies included a total 
subgroup of 291 BRVO eyes. In the 0.7 mg group of Ozurdex® the proportion of BRVO 
patients with VA gain ≥15 letters was 24% (0.7 mg dose group) at Day 90 compared to 15% 
in the sham control. This result was only statistically significant up to Day 90 of the study. At 
Day 180 the difference in the proportion of the 15-letter gainers was no longer statistically 
significant between groups. IVT dexamethasone is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma. 
Use of corticosteroids including Ozurdex® may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, 
increased eye pressure, glaucoma, and may increase the risk of secondary eye infections due 
to bacteria, fungi, or viruses.  
Numerous case series and uncontrolled studies have shown that IVT injections of 
anti-VEGF agents (bevacizumab and ranibizumab) can improve visual acuity (VA) and 
reduce retinal oedema in patients with both BRVO and CRVO (30, 154, 156, 157). A 
well-controlled study (BRAVO) of IVT ranibizumab has provided the first pivotal evidence 
that inhibition of VEGF is effective in the treatment of visual impairment due to macular 
edema secondary to BRVO (158, 159). Lucentis® (ranibizumab) was approved for the 
treatment of macular edema following RVO by US FDA in 2010 and by European 
Commission in 2011.  
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) has been approved in the EU and US for the treatment of 
macular edema following RVO.

SI.3.4  Myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV) 
Until recently, treatment modalities were limited to thermal laser photocoagulation for 
extrafoveal CNV and photodynamic therapy for juxtafoveal and subfoveal CNV (68, 83), 
(160), and possibly surgery (83). Both these modalities primarily aim at prevention of further 
visual loss with no improvement in vision (i.e., maintenance of vision) (70). Novel inhibitors 
of VEGF may now successfully restore visual acuity to some extent in patients with subfoveal 
myopic CNV (70, 83). 
To date, Eylea 40 mg/mL with a dose of 2 mg (by European Commission), ranibizumab 
(by US FDA/EC) are approved anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of myopic CNV. The 
recommended dose for Eylea is a single IVT injection of 2 mg. Additional doses should be 
administered only if visual and anatomic outcomes indicate that the disease persists. 
Recurrences are treated like a new manifestation of the disease. 
Diabetic macular edema (DME) 
SI.3.5 
Standard treatments for DME include focal/grid laser photocoagulation, IVT steroids, and 
vitrectomy for selected cases and advanced stages of DME. The disadvantage of laser 
photocoagulation and vitrectomy is the limited number of patients showing significant visual 
improvement. Many patients still lose VA despite these procedures, and in some cases, vision 
is further compromised as a result of these interventions. More recently, anti-VEGF 
compounds have been used in the treatment of DME. The effectiveness of anti-VEGF agents 
for the treatment of DME was demonstrated in several clinical studies. Based on the data from 
the pivotal Phase III studies RISE and RIDE (161), the Phase II study RESOLVE (162), and 
the pivotal Phase III study RESTORE (163), ranibizumab was approved in the EU and in the 
USA for the treatment of DME in 2011 and 2012, respectively. 
Additionally, ranibizumab with prompt or deferred laser treatment demonstrated superior 
efficacy compared to laser alone in a large randomized clinical trial sponsored by The 
Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network. At Year 1, the mean change in BCVA letter 
score was statistically superior for the ranibizumab + prompt laser group (+9 letters) and the 
ranibizumab + deferred laser group (+9 letters) compared with the laser group (+3 letters). A 
significantly greater proportion of patients gained ≥15 letters for the ranibizumab + prompt 
laser group (29.0%) and the ranibizumab + deferred laser group (26.7%) compared with the 
laser group (14.2%). The mean central retinal thickness was significantly reduced from 
baseline for the ranibizumab + prompt laser group (-112 μm) and the ranibizumab + deferred 
laser group (-111 μm) compared with the laser group (‑79 μm). There were also significantly 
greater proportions of eyes with ≥2-step improvement in the Diabetic Retinopathy Severity 
Scale for the ranibizumab + prompt laser group (20.9%) and the ranibizumab + deferred laser 
group (21.4%) compared with the laser group (6.2%). There were 3 injection-related cases of 
infectious endophthalmitis in the ranibizumab-treated groups. Elevation of IOP was reported 
more frequently in eyes in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group (50%) than in the 
ranibizumab (9%) or sham (11%) groups (164). 
The favorable results for ranibizumab plus prompt or deferred laser were sustained through 
the second and third years of the study, which constitutes the extent of the currently available 
evidence (165, 166). 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) has been approved in the EU and US for treatment of DME. The 
recommended dose for Eylea 40 mg/mL is 2 mg aflibercept administered by IVT monthly

months (8 weeks). 
Beovu® (brolucizumab) and Vabysmo® (faricimab) have been approved in the EU for the 
treatment of DME. 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
SI.3.6 
Treatment of ROP is based on the principle of retinal ablation. Treatment is directed to the 
avascular part of the retina with the goal of decreasing the production of angiogenic growth 
factors. Treatment modalities for established ROP range from transpupillary laser 
photocoagulation or cryotherapy to vitreoretinal surgery for advanced stages in subjects who 
develop retinal detachment. Both laser and cryotherapy are performed only on infants with 
advanced ROP, particularly stage 3 with “plus disease”, whereby laser coagulation is less 
prone to severe complications and considered standard of care. In the later stages of ROP, 
surgical options include scleral buckle (usually performed on infants with stage 4 or 5) and 
vitrectomy (performed only at stage 5).  
Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents are also used in select cases (earlier disease stages 
with involvement of the central retina). Ranibizumab is currently approved in Europe for the 
treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II 
(stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease. Further therapeutic approaches 
aim to prevent the progression of ROP to stages requiring treatment (e.g., propranolol, dietary 
supplementation with fatty acids). 
The presence of “plus disease” in zones I or II indicates that treatment, rather than 
observation, is appropriate. Treatment should be initiated within 72 hours for findings that 
indicate Type 1 ROP (122). 
SI.4 
Important co-morbidities found in the target population 
SI.4.1  Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
Important co-morbidities in the AMD population include glaucoma, cataract, stroke, 
hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia. In a case control study of 26,057 wet AMD patients and 
an equal number of controls from the Medicare population, wet AMD subjects had at least 
20% higher odds for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, emphysema, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis, arthritis, coronary heart disease, cataract, glaucoma, and 
myopia (167). 
In a combined cross-sectional and cohort study of 1,519,086 Medicare enrolees identified 
between 2000 and 2003, the prevalences of hypertension, diabetes, and history of MI were 
75%, 33%, and 5%, respectively, in the wet AMD group. In contrast, they were 73%, 27%, 
and 4.68% in the non-wet AMD group, and 65%, 25%, and 4.54% in the non-AMD group 
(p < 0.01 for comparing the prevalence in wet And non-wet AMD versus non-wet AMD 
groups) (12). 
A study to determine the incidence, pattern and ocular morbidity associated with age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) at the Guinness Eye Centre Onitsha Nigeria examined 
256 AMD patients of all types. Systemic co-morbidities were hypertension and diabetes; the 
main ocular co-morbidities were cataract and glaucoma (10).

A 2011 German publication hypothesized the following: “Oxidative Stress at the retinal level 
is the common pathway in the development of AMD and cataract. AMD and cataract are not 
two independent processes. Cataract is a self-defence reaction of the retina to reduce oxidative 
stress and retinal damage” (168). 
While in a German study of 45 wet AMD patients, who were injected with anti-
VEGF treatment, no history of glaucoma was detected (169), another study of intraocular 
pressure (IOP) post anti-VEGF agents in wet AMD patients found the following: Of the 
215 eyes receiving injections with bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab, 6% (n=13) had sustained 
IOP elevation requiring medical or laser interventions. Of the eyes receiving only 
bevacizumab, 9.9% (10/101) had sustained elevated IOP, while 3.1% (3/96) of eyes receiving 
only ranibizumab experienced increases (p=0.049). Patients with pre-existing glaucoma 
experienced higher rates of elevated IOP when compared with patients without pre-existing 
glaucoma (33% vs. 3.1% respectively; p<0.001). The glaucoma subgroup had a lower median 
number of injections (6; interquartile range 5-10) compared with the non-glaucoma group 
(9.5; interquartile range 6-13.7; p=0.031) (170). 
In a rural Italian community, 210 patients (79%) 65 year of age and older participated in a 
study of risk factors for AMD and age-related maculopathy. Older age (p = 0.014), prior 
cataract surgery (p <0.001) and hypertension history (p = 0.005) were associated with the two 
conditions (171). 
Stroke is also considered an important co-morbidity in the AMD patient population. A 5-year 
population-based follow-up study in Taiwan reported that wet AMD is associated with a 
higher risk of stroke in patients 65 years of age and older compared to a same age control 
group. The adjusted hazard ratio for stroke during the follow-up period was 2.21 (p = 0.001) 
(172). 
An Australian study followed participants for cardiovascular disease mortality. Of 3,654 
baseline participants (1992-1994) aged 49+ years, 2,335 were re-examined after 5 years and 
1,952 after 10 years. Retinal photographs were graded using the Wisconsin System. History 
and physical examination provided data on possible risk factors. Deaths and cause of death 
were confirmed by data linkage with the Australian National Death Index. Among persons 
aged <75 years at baseline, early AMD predicted a doubling of cardiovascular mortality (RR, 
2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03 to 5.19), over the next decade, after controlling for 
traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Late AMD predicted 5-fold higher cardiovascular 
mortality (RR, 5.57; 95% CI, 1.35 to 22.99) and 10-fold higher stroke mortality (RR, 10.21; 
95% CI, 2.39 to 43.60) after adjusting for age and sex only. These associations were not 
present when persons older than 75 were included (173). 
In a study to investigate whether AMD is associated with the development of ischemic and 
haemorrhagic stroke among elderly Americans, Medicare data were utilized. Baseline 
demographic variables and chronic conditions (AMD and type, history of MI, stroke, 
hypertension, and diabetes) were defined based on the occurrence of relevant ICD-9 codes in 
relevant diagnosis fields of the baseline Medicare Data. A total of 215,900 persons who had a 
diagnosis of MI or stroke during baseline period were excluded to form a cohort of 1,303,186 
individuals who were free of major cardio-cerebral vascular disease (CVD) at baseline. The 
prevalence of AMD was 10.6%, with 19.7% being wet AMD and 80.3% being non-wet 
AMD. Baseline age, gender, race, hypertension, and diabetes adjusted 2-year incident odds 
ratios and 95% confidence interval of stroke associated with AMD were 1.31 (1.26, 1.36) for

Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
wet AMD, 1.18 (1.15, 1.21) for non-wet AMD, and 1.21 (1.18, 1.23) for either neovascular or 
non-wet AMD. The conclusion was that the findings are suggestive of an association between 
AMD, especially wet AMD, and incident stroke, independently of demographic factors and 
co-morbidity (174). 
In the Women’s Health Initiative Sight Examination (WHISE) study, on the other hand, 
stroke was not found to be a risk factor for AMD. A total of 4,288 women aged 63 years and 
older participated. Prevalence of any AMD was 21.4% (n = 919). Of those with AMD, 5.8% 
(n = 53) had signs of exudative AMD (n = 39) or pure geographic atrophy (n = 14), limiting 
the power to examine associations. Significant associations between late AMD and CVD risk 
factors were (odds ratio [OR], 95% CI) older age (1.19, 1.13 to 1.27, p<.0001), more pack 
years smoked (1.02 per pack-year smoked, 1.003 to 1.03, p=0.01), systolic blood pressure 
(0.84 per 10 mmHg, 0.71 to 0.995, p=0.04), report of taking calcium channel blockers (2.49, 
1.21 to 5.12, p=0.04), self-reported history of diabetes (2.00, 1.01 to 3.96, p=0.05), and 
greater body mass index (1.05 per 1 kg/m2, 1.001 to 1.10, p=0.05). History of MI, stroke, use 
of statins, or white blood cell count was not associated with AMD (175). 
A report from a case series in Frankfurt, Germany, indicated that AMD patients who took 
anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents tended to develop large subretinal haemorrhages 
compared to non-AMD patients. Moreover, arterial hypertension was reported to be a strong 
risk factor for large subretinal haemorrhages in AMD patients receiving anticoagulants or 
antiplatelet agents (176). 
The AMD patient population has shown higher odds of hyperlipidaemia than the general 
population (167). The Beaver Dam Offspring Study (32) reported that older age, male sex, 
more pack-years of cigarettes smoked, higher serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level 
and hearing impairment were associated with early AMD. 
The association between arteriosclerosis and AMD was studied in a cross-sectional study with 
730 patients from the Munster age and retina study (MARS) which examines patients in the 
age range 60 to 80 years who were referred by ophthalmologists from the Muenster area. 
Patients with narrow angle glaucoma were excluded. All patients underwent a standardized 
ophthalmoscopic examination and were classified into four groups: without AMD (n=190), 
with unilateral or bilateral early forms of AMD (n=340), with unilateral late forms of AMD 
(n=139) and with bilateral late forms of AMD (n=50). The mean age was 72 years, 58% were 
women and the sex distribution within groups did not differ significantly. Risk factors for 
arteriosclerosis such as diabetes, body-mass-index and hypertension did not differ 
significantly. The number of smokers increased significantly with the severity of AMD 
(p=0.02). Associations with lipids were examined, adjusting for age and sex, and showed 
significant decrease of HDL (p=0.087) and significant increases of the HDL/LDL quotient 
(p=0.0007). The non-fasting triglyceride values (p=0.0058) correlated with the severity of 
AMD. The conclusions was that there was a highly significant, direct association of indicators 
of dyslipidaemia such as increasing HDL/LDL quotient and decreasing HDL with increasing 
severity of AMD (177). 
Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) 
SI.4.2 
A clinic-based case control study compared 408 patients with CRVO aged 21 years and older 
and 566 controls that were seen between 01 JAN 1990, and 31 DEC 2001 to determine risk 
factors for CRVO. An increased risk of CRVO was found in patients with systemic

Part II – Module SI: Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population 
hypertension, but odds ratios were greater for older patients. Risk of CRVO also increases 
with hypercoagulability, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and glaucoma (178). 
A population-based, cross-sectional study of 6,147 participants (whites, blacks, Hispanics, 
Chinese) from 6 US communities compared people with RVO (central and branch) to those 
without RVO. Independent risk factors associated with RVO were hypertension (OR 2.06, 
95% CI 1.18 to 3.59), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.56), renal dysfunction 
(OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.39), presence of retinal arteriovenous nicking (OR 4.01, 95% CI 
2.06 to 7.81) and focal arteriolar narrowing (OR 4.38, 95% CI 1.44 to 13.34) (179). 
In a study comparing 117 patients (61 males, 56 females; mean age 51 ± 13 years) with a 
history of RVO (62 CRVO, 48 BRVO, 7 both) to 202 age- and sex-matched control subjects, 
arterial hypertension was significantly more frequent in the RVO (central and branch) patients 
than in the control group (64.9% versus 28.2%, adjusted OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.4 to 7.9, 
p=0.0001). Diabetes was significantly more frequent as well (17.9% versus 7.9%, p=0.05) 
(180). 
A longitudinal study aimed to identify risk factors associated with CRVO among 1,302 
managed care enrolees (from 2001 to 2009) ≥55 years. Cox regression analysis was used to 
determine the hazard of CRVO. 
After adjustment for known confounders, a diagnosis of stroke increased the hazard of CRVO 
by 44% (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.23–1.68), and hypercoagulable state was associated with a 
145% increased CRVO risk (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.40–4.28). Individuals with end-organ 
damage from hypertension or diabetes mellitus had a 92% (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.52–2.42) and 
53% (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.28–1.84) increased risk of CRVO, respectively, relative to those 
without these conditions (37). 
A Medline literature review of RVO publications specified the following co-morbidities for 
CRVO: poor visual acuity at diagnosis, and presence of macular edema (which resolves in 
30% of non-ischemic CRVO eyes and in up to 73% of ischemic CRVO eyes). Cardiovascular 
disease was indicated in association with RVO (181). 
Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) 
SI.4.3 
Cardiovascular diseases are important co-morbidities in people with BRVO. A meta-analysis 
of several BRVO studies showed that, in patients with BRVO, the odds for hypertension were 
3.0 (95%-CI: 2.0–4.4), for hyperlipidaemia 2.3 (95%-CI: 1.5–3.5), and for diabetes mellitus 
1.1 (95%-CI: 0.8–1.5) compared to non-BRVO controls (182). Kaderli et al. (183) found that 
arterial stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity and aortic distensibility was abnormal in 
BRVO patients, in comparison with both healthy and hypertensive controls. 
A retrospective case–control study of 60 patients younger than 50 years indicated that 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and body mass index were more prevalent in this patient 
group compared to controls (184). History of asthma and of migraine showed also increased 
odds for the development of BRVO (Odds ratio 2.00 and 2.73, respectively) (57). Glaucoma 
is among the ocular comorbid conditions in BRVO populations (53). 
A Danish case-control study (62) with prospective follow-up data from Danish national 
registries covering 80% of the Danish population (4.4 million) was performed to study BRVO 
comorbidities. A total of 1,168 patients with photographically verified BRVO and 116,800 
controls aged ≥40 years when the occlusion was diagnosed in the corresponding case were

selected. Risk factors present 1 year before the diagnosis of BRVO included peripheral artery 
disease (odds ratio 1.83, 95%-CI: 1.14 - 2.95), diabetes (1.74, CI: 1.40 to 2.17), 
cardiovascular disease (2.07, CI: 1.79-2.40), and arterial hypertension (2.16, CI: 1.86 to 2.51). 
After the diagnosis, patients had an increased risk of developing arterial hypertension 
(incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95%-CI: 1.15 to 1.57), diabetes (1.51, 1.17 to 2.04), congestive 
heart failure (1.41, 1.12 to 1.68), and cerebrovascular disease (1.49, 1.27 to 1.76). The study 
conclusion was that diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease were associated with 
an increased risk of developing BRVO. BRVO was also associated with subsequently 
developing hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. 
These results fit the assumption that BRVO is a consequence of arterial thickening and that 
the arteriovenous crossing signs that precede it can be hallmarks of arterial disease (62). 
SI.4.4  Myopic choroidal neovascularization (myopic CNV) 
Evidence suggest that eyes with myopic CNV tend to have an early stabilization of vision 
followed by gradual and progressive decrease in visual acuity (VA) over time primarily due to 
the development of chorioretinal atrophy around regressed CNV (68). 
It has been estimated that 36% to 82% of the eyes with CNV show lacquer cracks while the 
latter’s frequency among highly myopic eyes without CNV is considerably lower (0.6%) (70). 
A retrospective study of (any) CNV patients younger than 50 years of age, who had been 
referred to a tertiary care ophthalmology department, was performed in Western Europe. 
CNV was associated with high myopia in 225 (62%) patients, pseudo-presumed ocular 
histoplasmosis syndrome in 42 (12%), angioid streaks in 17 (5%), and hereditary or traumatic 
or inflammatory disorders in 16 (4%) (77). 
Diabetic macular edema (DME) 
SI.4.5 
Diabetes is a leading cause of mortality and reduced life expectancy in the western world 
(185). In the USA it is ranked as the 6th leading cause of death accounting for over 71,000 
deaths per year (116). 
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss in people 20 to 74 years of age in the 
developed world (118, 186) and macular involvement is the major cause of visual loss in 
patients with DR (117, 187). 
A study investigated the systemic and ocular factors associated with diffuse macular edema in 
160 patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR). The risk of developing diffuse macular edema 
was 3.2 times greater in patients with high blood pressure (95%-CI, 1.5 to 6.9). Patients with 
cardiovascular disease had a higher prevalence of diffuse (58.0%) than focal (26.0%) or no 
maculopathy (16.0%) (p=0.01). The odds for developing diffuse macular edema were 3.4 
times greater in patients with vitreomacular adhesion (95%-CI, 1.15 to 13.30) than in those 
with complete posterior vitreoretinal attachment or vitreoretinal separation. The odds for 
development of diffuse macular edema were 7.7 times greater (95%-CI, 3.12 to 19.12) in 
patients with proliferative DR (PDR), respectively, in comparison with those with non-PDR 
(117). 
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) 
SI.4.6 
Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) often occurs in conjunction with other neonatal morbidities 
such as neurological dysfunction, poor brain growth, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),

intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (119). Preterm 
infants born at a very low GA are more susceptible having two or more comorbidities 
compared to older premature infants, and are more likely to develop severe forms of disease 
(188). Table SI.6 provides information on the proportion of patients with various 
comorbidities by GA from a Swiss neonatal registry (136). In a US NICHD (National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development) survey, a high proportion of preterm 
infants born at a GA <27 weeks (n=8,515) had significant comorbidities: 93% respiratory 
distress syndrome (RDS), 68% BPD, 59% any ROP, 46% patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 
36% late onset sepsis, 16% severe IVH (grade >2), 16% severe ROP, and 11% NEC (140). 
Data from a German retrospective cohort suggest that comorbidities also occur more 
frequently among low BW infants with ROP (stage 1 to 5) than among those without ROP 
(Table SI.7) (189).

PART II Module SII: Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Introduction 
A comprehensive toxicology and safety pharmacology program was conducted to support the 
clinical use as well as marketing authorization of aflibercept. The monkey was identified as 
the only relevant species for repeated-dose studies with intravitreal (IVT) administration. This 
module summarizes the relevant non-clinical findings for the 2 mg and 8 mg applications. As 
an overall conclusion, none of the non-clinical findings are considered a safety concern for 
aflibercept requiring risk management activities other than information via the suggested 
label. 
SII.1  Key Safety findings (from non-clinical studies) and relevance to human 
usage 
Table SII.1: Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage 
Key Safety findings 
(from non-clinical studies) 
•  Potential to impair fertility. 
•  Potential to be embryo-fetotoxic. 
Relevance to human usage 
Results from animal studies with high systemic exposure 
indicate that aflibercept can impair male and female 
fertility. Such effects are not expected after ocular 
administration with very low systemic exposure. 
Although the systemic exposure after ocular administration 
is very low, aflibercept should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to 
the foetus. 
Aflibercept is not recommended in women of childbearing 
potential not using contraception. 
Appropriate contraception during the treatment and for at 
least 3 months after the last administration of aflibercept 
2 mg or 4 months after the last administration of 8 mg has to 
be indicated for women who could possibly become 
pregnant. 
The malformations and variations observed after systemic 
treatment with aflibercept in the embryo-foetal development 
studies occur early in organogenesis and are not expected to 
occur after IVT administration of aflibercept in preterm 
infants with ROP, as the major organ systems affected are 
already fully developed in this population. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Repeated monthly IVT administration of aflibercept to monkeys for up to 8 months with the 
2 mg aflibercept formulation (with bilateral doses of 0.5, 2 and 4 mg/eye) and up to 6 months 
in a bridging study with the 8 mg aflibercept formulation (with bilateral doses of 4 and 
7 mg/eye) was not associated with ocular effects considered adverse. Based on the difference 
in vitreous volume between monkeys and humans (2 mL in monkey vs. 4 mL in humans), the 
dose used in the monkey eye corresponds to a doubled dose in the adult human eye (i.e., the

dose of 4 mg/monkey eye, corresponds to the clinical dose of 8 mg/adult human eye). Ocular 
findings were limited to inflammation that was generally mild and reversed completely or 
mostly by 4-weeks post-dose. 
Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates were observed in 
individual animals treated at and above the clinical dose of 2 mg/eye in the 8-month study on 
the 2 mg aflibercept formulation and with mostly low severity at the end of the dosing period. 
Although these lesions had not completely resolved after recovery, data indicate reversibility 
after the treatment free 4-month recovery period.  
Similar to that, microscopic findings at terminal necropsy in the 6-month IVT bridging study 
on the 8 mg aflibercept formulation were limited to erosion and/or ulceration, squamous 
metaplasia, and minimal haemorrhage of the respiratory epithelium in the nasal turbinates in 
animals administered aflibercept at 4 or 7 mg/eye. At the dose of 4 mg/monkey eye, which - 
based on differences in vitreous volume - corresponds to the clinical dose of 8 mg/adult 
human eye, the findings of the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates were mostly mild 
and reversible. At recovery sacrifice, no nasal turbinate ulceration was noted for animals 
administered aflibercept. The incidence and severity of lesions at the end of the 3-month 
recovery phase were lower compared with the terminal sacrifices at the end of the treatment 
period consistent with recovery. Similar nasal turbinate findings were also observed in two 
other arms of this study with repeated IVT administration of aflibercept 8 mg in different 
formulations for 3-months. 
An additional 3-month repeat-dose IVT toxicology study using clinically relevant high dose 
aflibercept formulation enriched with 6% and 10% high molecular weight species was 
conducted to support the specification of aflibercept 8 mg. This study demonstrated ocular 
tolerability and did not reveal any nasal turbinate findings at the administered bilateral dose of 
5.6 mg/eye. In contrast to all other IVT studies in monkeys, in which a dose volume of 
50 µL/eye was injected, only 40 µL/eye was administered in the current study. Assessing 
adverse events in clinical trials on adult patients including a sub-study of one of the pivotal 
Phase III studies (VIEW 2), serial nasal endoscopy and ears/nose/throat (ENT) specialist 
examinations of patients treated with 2 mg aflibercept per eye did not reveal any occurrence 
of these findings following repeated IVT dosing of aflibercept. In the PULSAR (nAMD Phase 
3), CANDELA (nAMD Phase 2), and PHOTON (DME Phase 2/3) studies, an analysis of 
treatment emergent adverse events of nasomucosal findings was conducted with no indication 
of a safety signal in the 8 mg aflibercept groups compared to 2 mg (Module 2.7.4). The lack 
of a safety signal following IVT administration of 2 mg (as the comparator group) in these 
studies is consistent with all prior clinical trials and post-marketing safety experience with 
aflibercept 2 mg. 
Since preterm infants with ROP have lower safety margins and could be more sensitive than 
adult patients with regard to changes of the nasal epithelium after IVT treatment with 
aflibercept, monitoring for nasal bleeding was included in the Phase III Study 20090 
(FIREFLEYE). No cases of nasal bleeding were observed in this study in ROP patients 
treated with aflibercept. 
The target-organ toxicities observed after systemic administration of aflibercept occurred at 
exposures well in excess of the exposures achieved after IVT administration in adult patients 
and are, therefore, not considered relevant for the intravitreal use of aflibercept in this patient 
population. The above clinical data of the ENT sub-study resolved the possibly remaining

Part II – Module SII: Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
concerns for adult patients. Target organs, which appeared already at the LOAEL of the 
studies with systemic administration were especially the kidneys, the growth plates of the 
bones, and the nasal cavities/sinuses. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, the Phase III 
Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE) in premature infants with ROP included monitoring for nasal 
bleeding, proteinuria and growth. No effects on these parameters were observed. Since the 
development of many organ systems, such as the kidney or the skeleton, continues in a 
preterm infant, growth and development of ROP patients enrolled in the clinical study are 
monitored for a prolonged follow-up period to 5 years of age by enrolment into a long-term 
follow-up study (FIREFLEYE NEXT, extension study 20275). 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of the 6-month studies in monkeys 
with weekly intravenous (IV) administration of aflibercept at doses ranging from 3 to 
30 mg/kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive 
hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose 
levels. Based on maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration time curve 
(AUC) for free aflibercept observed at the 3 mg/kg IV dose in monkeys, the systemic 
exposures were approximately 4,900-fold (in terms of Cmax) and 1,500-fold higher (in terms 
of AUC), respectively, than the exposures observed in adult patients after unilateral 
IVT administration of 2 mg/eye, and approximately 606-fold and 91-fold higher, respectively, 
than the population PK-estimated exposures in adult patients after unilateral 
IVT administration of 8 mg/eye. They are, therefore, considered not relevant for the 
intravitreal use of aflibercept. All changes were reversible. 
No changes to reproductive organs were observed after IVT administration of aflibercept in 
monkeys. 
Based on its mechanism of action, aflibercept is expected to affect embryo-foetal 
development. This was shown in an embryo-foetal development study in pregnant rabbits 
with IV administration (3 to 60 mg/kg). At 60 mg/kg foetal resorptions, pregnancy disruptions 
and numerous foetal (external, visceral and skeletal) malformations were observed. The 
maternal "No Observed Adverse Effect Level" (NOAEL) was the dose of 3 mg/kg, whereas 
the developmental NOAEL was not identified, since at 3 mg/kg still signs of embryo-foetal 
toxicity were observed. 
At the lowest dose of 3 mg/kg, systemic exposures of free aflibercept were approximately 
600- to 2,000-fold in excess of the maximum human exposure in adult patients after a 
unilateral IVT administration of 2 mg/eye as well as approximately 364- to 40-fold in excess 
of the population PK-estimated human exposure in adult patients after a unilateral 
IVT administration of 8 mg/eye (based on Cmax and AUC, respectively). 
In a combined early embryonic/embryo-foetal development study with aflibercept in pregnant 
rabbits with subcutaneous (s.c.) administration (0.1 to 1 mg/kg) starting at gestation 
day (GD) 1, no influence on maternal toxicity, gestation rate, post-implantation loss, placental 
weight, placental appearance, foetal sex distribution, or foetal weight was observed at all 
doses tested. The overall rate of cardiac ventricular septal defects (with/without malformation 
of major vessels), and skeletal malformations was slightly higher in aflibercept treated than 
control animals but showed no clear dose-dependency. A "spina bifida" was seen in a single 
foetus from each of 2 different dams that received 0.1 mg/kg during gestation. A 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SII: Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
"meningocele" was seen in 1 foetus from a single dam that received 1.0 mg/kg during 
gestation. Based on the results of this study, the maternal NOAEL was considered to be 
1 mg/kg.  
The developmental NOAEL was not identified. Comparison of the systemic exposures 
observed in this study with population PK-estimated mean exposures in adult patients indicate 
an exposure margin of approximately 10-fold following a unilateral 2 mg/eye dose or 0.9-fold 
following a unilateral 8 mg/eye dose, respectively, (based on mean AUC for free aflibercept). 
These data support that treatment with aflibercept is not recommended during pregnancy 
unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. Likewise, aflibercept is 
not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
The malformations and variations observed in the embryo-foetal development studies on 
aflibercept develop early in organogenesis whilst in preterm infants with ROP, development 
of the affected organ systems is already completed. Therefore, similar effects are not expected 
to occur after IVT treatment of these patients with aflibercept. Overall, from these data, there 
were no undue risks identified for the IVT treatment of premature infants presenting with 
ROP. 
Organ toxicity (Nephro-/Hepatotoxicity) 
No signals indicating a potential for nephro- or hepatotoxicity were observed following 
intravitreal administration in any of the studies conducted on the 2 mg aflibercept formulation 
as well as on the 8 mg aflibercept formulation. 
Genotoxicity 
In accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline S6, no 
genotoxicity studies were conducted. Since aflibercept is a large biotechnology-derived 
molecule, it is not expected to interact directly with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or other 
chromosomal material. 
Carcinogenicity 
No studies explicitly targeting carcinogenicity were conducted. Based on studies performed 
so far, there is no evidence that aflibercept (or other VEGF-inhibitory compounds) act as 
growth factors or are immunosuppressive. Therefore, currently there is no reason to suspect 
that aflibercept has a tumorigenic potential. 
General safety pharmacology/Drug interactions 
Effects of aflibercept on blood pressure and wound healing were only observed following 
systemic administration. Exposures after systemic administration were substantially above 
those following IVT injection. Therefore, IVT administration of aflibercept is not expected to 
exert appreciable effects on VEGF-mediated processes outside of the eye of adult patients. 
Since safety margins are low in preterm infants for blood pressure increases, blood pressure 
measurements were included in the Phase III Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE). Analyses showed 
that plasma aflibercept concentrations were not related to changes in systolic or diastolic 
blood pressure. 
In the CANDELA Phase II and PULSAR/PHOTON Phase III studies, no clinically 
meaningful changes in blood pressure were observed with the treatment of 8 mg aflibercept.

EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SII: Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification 
Since no overlapping substrate specificity in the metabolism of aflibercept and potentially 
co-administered small molecule drugs has to be expected, no drug interaction studies have 
been performed. 
Conclusions on non-clinical safety data 
The following conclusions can be derived from the non-clinical data outlined above: 
No important identified risks (confirmed by clinical data) were identified. 
The non-clinical safety studies performed in monkeys and rabbits with systemic 
administration of aflibercept, suggest a potential of aflibercept to impair fertility and to exert 
embryo-fetotoxic effects. However, the systemic exposure to free aflibercept in the 
IV monkey study investigating fertility was distinctly higher than the exposure observed in 
adult patients following unilateral intravitreal injection of 2 mg or the population 
PK-estimated exposure following unilateral intravitreal injection of 8 mg/eye. Overall, 
aflibercept should not be administered during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus, and aflibercept is not recommended in women of 
childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment and for at least 
3 months after the last dose of 2 mg/eye or 4 months after the last dose of 8 mg/eye. Clinical 
data on this issue are currently not available. The occurrence of embryo-fetotoxicity (regarded 
as important potential risk) is an objective of routine pharmacovigilance monitoring. The 
effects on the developing embryo/foetus observed in the embryo-foetal development studies 
occur early in organogenesis. They are not expected to occur after IVT administration of 
aflibercept in preterm infants with ROP, as major organogenesis is already complete in this 
population. 
Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates, which were 
observed in monkeys in repeat-dose IVT studies with the 2 mg aflibercept as well as with 
8 mg aflibercept formulations and treatment durations from 3 to 8 months, occurred from 
bilateral doses of 2 mg/eye and at a dose volume of 50 µL/eye. In contrast, no nasal turbinate 
findings were seen in another 3-month IVT study on the 8 mg aflibercept formulation with 
enhanced impurity levels after application of 5.6 mg/eye at a dose volume of 40 µL/eye and 
higher systemic exposure than in the other IVT studies (Cmax: 20 vs. 6-11 µg/mL, 
AUC(028 days): more than 5,000 µg·h/mL vs. 2,000 to 3,400 µg·h/mL). These data suggest that 
local exposure to aflibercept, i.e., leakage of aflibercept formulation after administration of 
higher dose volumes from 50 µL/eye onwards from the injection canal via the nasolacrimal 
duct, might lead to nasomucosal changes in monkeys, while this is not observed after 
injection of 40 µL/eye. Based on difference in vitreous volume between monkey and human 
(2 mL in monkey vs. 4 mL in humans) it can be expected that an application volume of 80 µL 
per eye will be tolerated without remarkable leakage from the injection site after IVT dosing 
in human patients, thus covering the clinically used dose volume of 70 µL/eye for aflibercept 
8 mg. This fits to the fact that nasomucosal lesions were also not confirmed in a targeted 
sub-study within the clinical Phase III study VIEW 2 with a dose of 2 mg/eye and a dose 
volume of 50 µL/eye. In the PULSAR (nAMD Phase 3), CANDELA (nAMD Phase 2), and 
PHOTON (DME Phase 2/3) studies, an analysis of treatment emergent adverse events of 
nasomucosal findings was conducted with no indication of a safety signal in the 8 mg 
aflibercept groups compared to 2 mg (Module 2.7.4). The lack of safety signal following 
IVT administration of 2 mg (as the comparator group) in these studies is consistent with all 
prior clinical trials and post-marketing safety experience with aflibercept 2 mg. In the

Phase III Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE) in preterm infants with ROP, monitoring for nasal 
bleeding was included, since this patient population could be more sensitive with regard to 
changes of the nasal epithelium after IVT treatment with aflibercept and has a higher systemic 
exposure than adults. Again, no cases of nasal bleeding were observed in this study.  
Due to the low systemic exposure following the IVT route of administration, aflibercept is 
generally not expected to exert appreciable effects on VEGF-mediated processes outside of 
the eye. To confirm this also in preterm infants with ROP, target organs like the kidneys, 
growth plates of the bones, and the nasal cavities/sinuses, which appeared already at the 
LOAEL of the toxicological studies with systemic administration were included in the 
monitoring of the Phase III Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE). No cases of nasal bleeding, 
proteinuria and no effects on growth were observed in this study. Since the development of 
organ systems such as the kidney or the skeleton continues in a preterm infant, growth and 
development of ROP patients enrolled in the clinical study will be monitored through 5 years 
of age in a long-term follow-up study (FIREFLEYE NEXT, extension study 20275).  
No signs of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity were observed in the nonclinical toxicology 
program. 
Studies focusing on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or drug interactions were not performed, 
since such endpoints are not applicable to the drug or are not relevant for IVT treatment. 
Blood pressure increases were observed after systemic administration of aflibercept in safety 
pharmacology studies in rodents. Since safety margins are low for this parameter in preterm 
infants, blood pressure was monitored in the Phase III Study 20090 (FIREFLEYE). No 
correlation between change in blood pressure and concentrations of free aflibercept was 
observed in this study. 
In the 8 mg aflibercept CANDELA Phase II study no nasal mucosal adverse events were 
reported. Similarly, in the Phase III studies PULSAR/PHOTON no signal pertinent to nasal 
erosions/ulcerations were observed through week 48 under 8 mg aflibercept therapy. 
Currently, there is no need for additional non-clinical investigations or research activities.

SIII.1  Brief overview of development 
Eylea (international non-proprietary name: aflibercept) was developed by Bayer AG and 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as an effective treatment for a number of ophthalmologic 
conditions. 
SIII.1.1  Development in the indication “wet age-related macular degeneration 
(wet AMD)” 
SIII.1.1.1  Wet AMD (Eylea 40 mg/mL, 2 mg dose) 
The initial clinical development program for the indication neovascular (wet) age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD) consisted of 4 studies. 
In 2005, the clinical development program was initiated by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
with the start of the Phase-1 study VGFT-OD-0502 (SN 14395). This study provided the first 
evidence of a dose-response in the bioeffects of intravitreally (IVT) administered Eylea and 
indicated that single doses of less than 0.5 mg Eylea were associated with sub-optimal effects. 
At higher single doses, however, Eylea was associated with improvements in visual acuity 
and improvements in morphologic characteristics of the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) 
lesion. These improvements, which were evident for at least 1 month after a single injection, 
provided the first evidence of the durability of the effect of IVT Eylea in subjects with wet 
AMD. 
In Phase-2 study VGFT-OD-0508 (SN 14394), which assessed 0.5 mg and 2 mg Eylea 
administered monthly or every 12 weeks and 4 mg Eylea administered every 12 weeks, all 
treatment groups experienced improvements in visual acuity as early as Week 1 and these 
improvements were maintained through Week 12 (the assessment of the primary efficacy 
endpoint). The improvement in visual acuity was maintained during Weeks 16 through 52 
with an average of only 2 additional doses during this time. These results and the time course 
of improvements suggested that initiating treatment with 3 monthly injections was associated 
with a better outcome than a single injection of either 2 mg or 0.5 mg. In addition, the 
improvements in visual acuity were similar in all treatment groups at Week 8, suggesting that, 
in principle, the effects of Eylea may be maintained over an 8-week dosing interval without 
compromising efficacy. In the subsequent flexible-dosing phase of the study, when criteria-
based dosing allowed for prolonged dosing intervals (i.e., subjects were only retreated if one 
or more of the protocol-specified retreatment criteria was met and there was no limit to how 
long a subject could go between treatments) the 0.5 mg dose did not perform as well as the 
2 mg dose. 
The dosing rationale for the Phase-3 studies was based on the improvements in best-corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA) seen in VGFT-OD-0508 (SN 14394) and the improvements in 
morphologic endpoints as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein 
angiography (FA). The two pivotal studies (VIEW 1 [1y] and VIEW 2 [1y]) compared 0.5 mg 
and 2 mg Eylea dosed monthly and 2 mg Eylea dosed every two months (after an initial 
three-monthly injections) to ranibizumab 0.5 mg dose monthly. The rationale for including 
2 mg Eylea dosed every two months was based on the observation from VGFT-OD-0508 
(SN 14394) that, at Week 8, improvements in visual acuity after a single 2 mg dose were 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
similar to those obtained with 2 mg dosed monthly, suggesting that a longer and less 
burdensome dosing interval (i.e., every 8 weeks) may be possible without sacrificing efficacy. 
In Year 2, the mandatory dosing interval was extended to 12 weeks, but subjects were allowed 
to receive injections more often, if certain re-treatment criteria were fulfilled (the treatment 
scheme in Year 2 is referred to as "modified quarterly dosing"). 
In the pivotal studies (VIEW 1 [1y] and VIEW 2 [1y]), the primary endpoint, proportion of 
subjects maintaining vision at Week 52, was met for all Eylea treatment regimens, was 
duplicated in both pivotal studies and the integrated analysis (1y) of the data from the pivotal 
studies, and established the non-inferiority of Eylea to ranibizumab (at a pre-specified 10% 
margin). The statistical test sequence employed in the two pivotal studies showed 
confirmatory results with very narrow confidence intervals. 
In conclusion, administration of 2 mg Eylea administered every two months produced 
essentially the same efficacy results as monthly dosing of 2 mg Eylea or monthly dosing of 
0.5 mg ranibizumab in subjects with wet AMD. In particular, this was clearly apparent in 
terms of the primary and clinically most important measure in the pivotal Phase-3 studies, 
visual acuity. 
The efficacy and safety results from the pivotal Phase-3 studies showed that with 2 mg Eylea 
dosed every two months, subjects with wet AMD can undergo less frequent intravitreal 
injections, which are associated with certain risks, without sacrificing efficacy. While it 
cannot be excluded that a more frequent dosing with 2 mg Eylea could lead to even better 
results in some subjects, the vast majority of clinical subjects receiving 2 mg Eylea every 
two months, after three initial monthly doses, showed robustly good and durable 
improvements in vision as well as morphologic characteristics of the CNV lesion. 
The results in Year 2 of the studies showed that the improvements achieved after 1 year of 
treatment were largely maintained on modified quarterly dosing with Eylea, particularly in 
those subjects continuing an exclusively proactive treatment. The latter were those just 
receiving the mandatory 3 injections over the course of Year 2. 
Therefore, it can be concluded, that the benefits, in particular the possibility of prolonged, 
proactive dosing intervals of 8 weeks (or even longer, as suggested by the large proportion of 
subjects who were exclusively treated at intervals of 12 weeks in Year 2 of the pivotal 
studies) of a Eylea therapy, clearly outweigh potential risks arising from its use. Overall, the 
dosing experience in Year 1 and Year 2 of the pivotal studies suggested that Eylea treatment 
should be initiated with 1 injection per month for 3 consecutive months, followed by one 
injection every 2 months. After the first 12 months of treatment, the treatment interval may be 
extended based on visual and anatomic outcomes. In this case the schedule for monitoring 
should be determined by the treating physician and may be more frequent than the schedule of 
injections. 
Based on these results and the favourable benefit/risk balance, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) was the first health authority to approve Eylea for the indication of wet 
AMD on 18 NOV 2011; EU approval was granted on 22 NOV 2012. 
Patients originally enrolled in VIEW 1 who completed the core study period of 96 weeks had 
the opportunity to continue (or start) treatment with Eylea 2 mg in the open-label extension

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
study VGFT-OD-0910 (SN 14832). A total of 320 out of 323 enrolled1 patients from VIEW 1 
received extension treatment in the study eye at individual injection intervals ranging 
from 4 to 12 weeks for an additional mean treatment duration of 25.8 months (range: 1 to 
41 months). In conclusion, visual acuity as measured by BCVA was largely maintained with 
repeated long-term treatment, and treatment with Eylea was generally safe and well tolerated. 
No new safety signals were observed in this long-term extension study. 
An additional AMD study was SIGHT (SN 13406), a randomized, double-masked, 
photodynamic therapy-controlled Phase III study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
IVT VEGF Trap-Eye in Chinese subjects with wet AMD. In addition to the exposure data, the 
safety results observed in the VIEW 1 extension study and in SIGHT were also considered in 
this RMP version. 
Another additional study included in this RMP version is ALTAIR (SN 17668). This 
randomized, open-label Phase IV study assessed the efficacy and safety of intravitreal 
administration of aflibercept with two different approaches of Treat and Extend dosing 
regimen in Japanese subjects with wet AMD for up to 2 years; the 1-year data are considered 
for this RMP version. 
SIII.1.1.2  Wet AMD (Eylea 114.3 mg/mL, 8 mg dose) 
The clinical development program for the 8 mg (High Dose, HD) aflibercept dose in the 
indication wet AMD consists of 2 studies: 
A randomized, single-masked, active-controlled Phase II study CANDELA was conducted. 
The primary objectives of the study were to determine the safety of 8 mg aflibercept injection 
and to determine if 8 mg aflibercept provided greater intraocular pharmacodynamic effect 
and/or longer duration of action compared to 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept injection. Fifty-
three patients were randomized to receive 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept (IAI group) and 53 to 
receive 8 mg intravitreal aflibercept (high dose group, HD group). Overall, the mean (SD) 
duration of treatment in the study eye was 36.9 (7.77) weeks in the IAI group and 37.7 (4.52) 
weeks in the HD group. Results of the CANDELA study showed that: 
•  A numerically higher proportion of participants in the HD group compared with 
IAI group showed improvement in anatomical outcomes (dryness in centre subfield, 
dry macula, absence of subretinal fluid in the centre subfield and in the macula) at 
week 16 and 44. 
•  A numerically higher improvement in BCVA was observed in the HD group when 
compared with the IAI group. A numerically higher proportion of participants in the 
HD group achieved a clinically meaningful BCVA gain of ≥ 10 letters and ≥ 15 letters 
from baseline. 
•  The HD group showed a numerically greater median reduction in central retinal 
thickness when compared with the IAI group at weeks 16 and 44. 
•  The HD group showed numerically greater reduction in total lesion size and choroidal 
neovascularisation size at Week 44. 
1 Please note: Three subjects enrolled in the VIEW 1 extension study received Eylea 2 mg at Week 96 in the 
original VIEW 1 study (not counted for the VIEW 1 study exposure) but did not receive further treatment in the 
extension study. These 3 patients are considered for the safety analyses in the VIEW 1 extension study, and the 3 
active injections at Week 96 are considered for the calculation of the AMD and overall exposure across studies.

•  Treatment with IAI and HD was well-tolerated and both the ocular and systemic safety 
profile of HD and IAI were similar. No new safety signals were identified. 
The Phase III randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study PULSAR is ongoing, 
week 48 results are displayed in this RMP. The primary objective was to determine if 
treatment with 8 mg aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provides non-inferior BCVA 
change compared to 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks in participants with wet AMD.  
•  336 patients were randomized to receive 2 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 8 weeks 
(2q8) after 3 initial injections at 4-week intervals 
•  335 patients to receive 8 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 12 weeks (HDq12) after 
3 initial injections at 4-week intervals 
•  338 patients to receive 8 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 16 weeks (HDq16) after 
3 initial injections at 4-week intervals 
For the primary endpoint, the week 48 data of the PULSAR study showed non-inferiority of 
the 8 mg doses, HDq12 and HDq16, versus the treatment with the comparator 2q8. The 
following overall conclusions were made: 
•  Treatment with HD aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provided non-inferior 
increases in BCVA from baseline at Week 48 compared to treatment with 2 mg 
aflibercept every 8 weeks. 
•  Treatment with HD aflibercept was superior to treatment with 2 mg aflibercept in that 
11.7% points more participants in the combined All HD group (combined 
HDq12+HDq16) than in the 2q8 group had no IRF and no SRF in central subfield at 
Week 16. 
•  The non-inferior visual acuity outcomes in the HDq12 and HDq16 groups compared 
to 2q8 were achieved with the majority of participants remaining on their randomized 
treatment interval: 79% and 77%, respectively.  This led to a clinically meaningful 
reduction in the number of injections over 48 weeks compared to treatment with 2 mg 
aflibercept every 8 weeks. 
•  Overall, 83% of participants in the All HD group were able to be maintained on a 
dosing interval of 12 weeks or longer with 8 mg aflibercept treatment, while 17% of 
participants did require shortening of the dosing interval to 2q8. 
Immunogenicity was low across all treatment groups. None of the ADA positive 
samples were found to be positive in the Neutralizing (NAb) assay. 
• 
•  Review of the safety data did not reveal any new signals or adverse trends in the HD 
(8 mg dose) aflibercept groups compared to the 2 mg group. No new adverse drug 
reactions were identified. The ocular and systemic safety profile of aflibercept HD was 
consistent with the established safety profile of aflibercept 2 mg. 
SIII.1.2  Development in the indication "macular edema secondary to central 
retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)" (Eylea 40mg/mL, 2 mg dose) 
The clinical development program for the indication “macular edema secondary to central 
retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)” comprised two pivotal Phase III studies, each comparing 
2 mg Eylea IVT injections every 4 weeks (2Q4) for 20 weeks with sham injections every

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
4 weeks. Eligible subjects in both studies were randomized using a ratio of 3: 2 (Eylea:sham), 
with stratification by geographic region and baseline BCVA. 
In the first 24-week period of both studies (i.e., Week 0 to Week 20), subjects received either 
2 mg Eylea IVT injections every 4 weeks (2Q4), or sham injections every 4 weeks. The 
sham injection was performed by pressing a syringe barrel with no active drug to the 
conjunctival surface (without a needle or intraocular penetration).  
In the next 28-week period (Week 24 through Week 52), subjects in both studies were 
evaluated monthly. In the COPERNICUS study, subjects in both treatment groups were 
eligible to receive either Eylea 2 mg IVT injections as clinically needed (PRN), according to 
protocol-defined retreatment criteria, or sham injections. In the GALILEO study, subjects in 
the Eylea group received either Eylea 2 mg IVT injections PRN, according to protocol-
defined retreatment criteria, or sham injections. Subjects in the sham group continued to 
receive only sham injections. 
Starting at Week 52, all subjects in the COPERNICUS study were eligible to continue in a 
1-year PRN extension. Subjects were evaluated quarterly to receive 2 mg Eylea IVT 
injections according to the re-treatment criteria. Sham injections were not given during this 
period. If, in the investigator’s opinion, subjects required more frequent dosing, they may 
have been dosed as frequently as every 4 weeks. 
Starting at Week 52, all subjects in the GALILEO study were eligible to continue in a 
6-month PRN extension, with follow-up visits every 8 weeks through Week 76. In the Eylea 
treatment group, subjects received either 2 mg Eylea IVT injections or sham injections, 
according to the retreatment criteria. In the sham group, subjects received 2 mg Eylea at 
Week 52 unless the masked investigator decided - for medical reasons - that study drug 
treatment was not in the best interest of the subject. If Eylea was not administered at this visit, 
the subject received sham treatment. At Weeks 60 and 68, subjects in the sham group received 
either Eylea or sham treatment depending on the same retreatment criteria used from Week 24 
in the Eylea treatment group. No treatments were administered at Week 76. 
All subjects were eligible to receive panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) at any time during the 
study if they progressed to clinically significant ocular neovascularization. 
The primary efficacy variable in both studies was the proportion of subjects who gained 
15 letters or more of BCVA (using the ETDRS protocol) over baseline at Week 24. The 
primary efficacy variable was supported by secondary efficacy variables of change in BCVA 
from baseline to Week 24, change in CRT from baseline to Week 24, proportion of subjects 
progressing to any neovascularization by Week 24, and change in NEI VFQ-25 total scores 
from baseline to Week 24. Tertiary variables were assessed at the 52-week endpoint. Efficacy 
variables were assessed for each study individually (i.e., COPERNICUS and GALILEO) and 
in an integrated analysis of the pooled 6-month data from the two Phase-3 studies. 
In both studies, Eylea administered 2Q4 was shown to be superior to sham treatment with 
regard to the proportion who gained ≥ 15 letters of vision during the first 24 weeks of 
treatment. In addition, all other efficacy results (i.e., secondary and tertiary) showed robust 
benefits. The results of the individual studies and the integrated analysis were consistent over 
all parameters investigated and confirmed the superiority of Eylea for improving visual acuity 
over observation alone in subjects with macular edema (ME) secondary to CRVO.

This clinical effect was largely sustained on continued active treatment with Eylea with less 
frequent PRN dosing up to Week 52 and a significant benefit of treatment was still shown at 
Week 76 (in GALILEO) or Week 100 (in COPERNICUS). However, the switch from 
proactive, fixed dosing at Week 24 to reactive PRN dosing gradually led to a mean loss up to 
approximately 1 line of BCVA. Moreover, the loss was accelerated when the monitoring 
interval was extended from 4 up to 12 weeks after the first year, suggesting that a proactive 
regimen might be more adequate to maintain achieved gains. Similar results were seen with 
most of the other efficacy measures. 
Subgroup analyses showed that there are no restrictions regarding efficacy of Eylea in relation 
to organ function such as renal impairment, liver function, or diabetes status. 
Overall, IVT injections of Eylea were safe and well tolerated. Differences seen in the 
incidence of some disease-related adverse events between the 2Q4 and PRN dosing phases 
may represent a de-stabilization of the disease with reactive PRN dosing that was well con-
trolled with the proactive fixed-dosing regimen. 
Based on these results and the favourable benefit/risk balance, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) was the first health authority to approve Eylea for the indication 
CRVO on 21 SEP 2012. In Europe, Eylea was approved by the EMA in the CRVO indication 
on 26 AUG 2013. In Japan, treatment of CRVO with Eylea was approved by the Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in NOV 2013. 
SIII.1.3  Development in the indication "macular edema secondary to branch 
retinal vein occlusion (BRVO)" (Eylea 40mg/mL, 2 mg dose) 
The BRVO clinical development program was initiated by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
building directly from the clinical development program of the approved indications AMD 
and CRVO (see aforementioned considerations). The design of the Phase III BRVO 
development program was based on advice given at several scientific advice meetings/letters 
with CHMP and FDA. 
The clinical development program for BRVO consisted of one pivotal Phase III study 
(SN 15432, VGFTe RVO-1027, VIBRANT). VIBRANT was a randomized, double-masked, 
active controlled 52-week study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated 
IVT administration of VEGF Trap-Eye compared with grid laser photocoagulation in subjects 
with macular edema secondary to BRVO. A total of 183 patients were randomized and 
exposed to study treatment (91 in the Eylea group and 92 in the laser group). The study was 
conducted by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in North America (USA, Canada) and Japan. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA 
from baseline to Week 24. Study treatment (up to 48 weeks, followed by a 4 week 
observation period) was completed with LPLV on 10 MAR 2014. 
Week 24 analyses showed that 53% of patients who received Eylea 2Q4 gained at least 
15 letters in vision from Baseline at Week 24, compared to 27% of patients who received 
standard-of-care treatment with macular grid laser (primary endpoint; p <0.001). At Week 24, 
patients who received Eylea 2Q4 achieved a 17.0 letter mean improvement over Baseline in 
BCVA (a secondary endpoint) compared to a 6.9 letter mean improvement in patients who 
received laser (p <0.0001).

The final study data observed at Week 52 showed that the efficacy achieved at Week 24 (time 
of primary endpoint assessment) was maintained through Week 52, even with the treatment 
interval increased from monthly to every 8 weeks during the second study half: Subjects in 
the Eylea 2 mg group still demonstrated a nominally significant improvement in mean change 
in BCVA over subjects in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group2 from Baseline to Week 52 (mean 
change of 17.1 vs. 12.2 letters, LS mean change difference 5.2 letters, 95%-CI: [1.7; 8.7], 
p=0.0035; FAS Last-Observation-Carried-Forward [LOCF]), treatment initiated with Eylea 
provided a higher proportion of subjects with an increase of ≥15 letters in BCVA at Week 52 
compared to Laser+Eylea treatment (57.1% vs. 41.1%, adjusted difference 16.2%, 95%-CI: 
[2.0; 30.5], p=0.0296; FAS LOCF), and Eylea led to a mean reduction in CRT, which was 
greater than Laser+Eylea 2 mg at Week 52 (mean change of -283.9 vs. -249.3 microns, LS 
mean change difference -29.5 microns, 95%-CI: [-54.7; -4.4], p=0.0218; FAS LOCF). The 
subjects in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group, who were not exposed to Eylea through Week 20, 
benefitted from the rescue treatment option with VEGF Trap-Eye (beginning at Week 24, if 
pre-specified eligibility criteria were met) by gaining approximately 5 letters in BCVA (1 line 
of vision) from Week 24 to Week 52. 
Overall, the incidence of ocular TEAEs in the study eye through Week 52 was similar 
between the 2 groups (47.8% in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group and 49.5% in the Eylea 2 mg 
group). Likewise, the incidence of non-ocular TEAEs was similar between groups (68.5% 
Laser+Eylea 2 mg and 67.0% Eylea 2 mg). The most common ocular TEAEs (≥5%) in the 
study eye were "conjunctival hemorrhage" (15.2% in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group and 24.2% 
in the Eylea 2 mg group; this difference was due to the lower number of penetrating injections 
in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group), "eye pain" (7.6% Laser+Eylea 2 mg and 5.5% Eylea 2 mg), 
and "eye irritation" (1.1% Laser+Eylea 2 mg and 7.7% Eylea 2 mg). Other individual ocular 
TEAEs in the study eye were low and mostly balanced between treatment groups. Treatment-
emergent ocular AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the injection procedure in 
the study eye occurred with a higher frequency in the Eylea 2 mg group (29.7%) than in the 
Laser+Eylea 2 mg group (19.6%). Also, this difference was probably due to the lower number 
of penetrating injections in the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group. The incidence of SAEs through 
Week 52 was slightly higher in the Eylea group (10.9% on Laser+Eylea 2 mg and 15.4% on 
Eylea 2 mg). Only one study subject (in the Eylea 2 mg group) experienced an ocular SAE in 
the study eye ("traumatic cataract", which was considered injection-related). No drug-related 
SAEs were reported. Through Week 52, 2 study subjects experienced an adjudicated 
Anti-Platelet Trialists Collaboration (APTC) event (both patients were in the Laser+Eylea 2 
mg group; "cerebrovascular accident" occurred prior to any Eylea rescue and "myocardial 
infarction" occurred after first Eylea exposure) and there was one death (this patient, 
randomized to the Laser+Eylea 2 mg group, died from pneumonia prior to any Eylea rescue). 
Overall, the observed safety profile trough Week 52 was as expected and in line with the 
Week 24 safety results. Eylea was generally well-tolerated with a favourable ocular and 
systemic safety profile after 52 weeks of treatment in this population of subjects with BRVO. 
Based on the favourable Week 24 results that were used for the submission of a supplemental 
Biologics License Application, Eylea was approved for the treatment of BRVO patients by 
the FDA on 06 OCT 2014, and in the EU on 25 FEB 2015. 
2 Patients randomized to initial laser treatment had the opportunity to be treated with Eylea from Week 24 
onwards (i.e., after the evaluation for the primary endpoint), if pre-specified eligibility criteria were met.

SIII.1.4  Development in the indication "choroidal neovascularization secondary 
to pathologic myopia" (myopic CNV) (Eylea 40mg/mL, 2 mg dose) 
The clinical development program for the indication "choroidal neovascularization secondary 
to pathologic myopia" consisted of one pivotal Phase III study comparing a single 2 mg Eylea 
IVT injection followed by additional injections up to every 4 weeks in case of recurring or 
persisting CNV with sham. Eligible patients were randomized in a ratio of 3:1 (Eylea:sham). 
In the first 24-week period of the study, patients received either one mandatory 2 mg Eylea 
IVT injection at Baseline followed by sham injections every 4 weeks, which could be 
replaced by additional active injections in case of recurring or persisting CNV, or sham 
injections every 4 weeks only. Sham injections were performed by pressing a syringe barrel 
with no active drug to the conjunctival surface (without a needle or intraocular penetration). 
In the next study period (Week 24 through Week 44), patients in both treatment arms (i.e., 
including the patients who were previously treated with sham) were allowed to receive active 
Eylea 2 mg treatment in the case of recurring or persisting CNV; otherwise, sham injections 
were administered for masking purposes. Initially, all patients in the sham group received one 
mandatory active injection at Week 24. Patients were evaluated monthly until Week 48. 
The primary efficacy variable was the change in BCVA as assessed following the ETDRS 
protocol from Baseline to Week 24. The primary efficacy variable was supported by one 
confirmatory secondary efficacy variable of proportion of patients who gain ≥15 letters in 
both treatment groups. 
Exploratory secondary variables included the proportion of patients who gain or lose certain 
amounts of letters of BCVA, the change in central retinal thickness assessed on OCT, the 
change in total CNV lesion size, and leakage as assessed by FA, as well as vision-related 
Quality of life (QoL) as assessed by NEI-VFQ-25 and general health as assessed by ED-5D. 
The primary and secondary efficacy analyses performed at Week 24 demonstrated superiority 
of Eylea over sham (i.e., no active intervention) in the treatment of myopic CNV. Clinically 
meaningful improvements compared to sham (with nominal p-values <0.05) were observed in 
all functional (BCVA) and morphological (CRT, CNV lesion size, leakage area) variables as 
well as in the NEI VFQ-25 total score. In contrast, the baseline disease conditions in the 
untreated sham group on average continued to persist, or even had deteriorated by Week 24. 
Beyond Week 24, the mean change in BCVA was maintained and even slightly increased 
until Week 48 in the Eylea 2 mg group; exploratory analyses of additional morphological and 
functional outcomes showed consistent improvements up to Week 48. In the Sham+Eylea 
2 mg group, the mandatory start of active treatment with Eylea 2 mg as from Week 24 also 
resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in all efficacy variables up to Week 48. 
However, the magnitude of change did not reach the same level as in those patients treated 
with Eylea from the beginning of the study. 
Overall, IVT injections of Eylea were safe and well tolerated through Week 48 in either 
treatment group. No patient died during the course of the study; the overall rate of treatment-
emergent SAEs from Baseline through Week 48 was low with 8 study patients involved 
(6.6%; N=122). In the Sham+Eylea 2 mg group, the only SAE (PT: "VA reduced" in one 
patient [3.2%; N=31]) occurred in the study eye and was considered unrelated to treatment or 
injection. In the Eylea 2 mg group, 7 patients (7.7%; N=91) experienced a treatment-emergent 
SAE, including 3 patients (3.3%) with ocular and 4 patients (4.4%) with non-ocular

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
treatment-emergent SAEs. Only one ocular treatment-emergent SAE (1.1%) occurred in the 
study eye, a macular hole that was regarded as related to study drug (and injection procedure 
and study procedure as well). All non-ocular treatment-emergent SAEs were classified as not 
related to study drug, study procedure, or injection. Only one non-ocular treatment-emergent 
SAE, a cerebral haemorrhage in the Eylea 2 mg group (1.1%), was classified as an 
APTC event by the masked Adjudication Committee. Some small differences between 
treatment groups in the incidence of non-ocular TEAEs were deemed attributable to the 
3:1 randomization leading to uneven group sizes. 
Based on the favourable benefit/risk balance observed at Week 24, the data obtained from the 
15170 study (MYRROR) were submitted in Japan for market approval by PMDA in 
DEC 2013, and in SEP 2014 the approval for treatment of myopic CNV was received from 
MHLW. In the EU, Eylea was approved for the treatment of myopic CNV on 28 OCT 2015. 
SIII.1.5  Development in the indication "diabetic macular edema" (DME) 
SIII.1.5.1  DME (Eylea 40 mg/mL, 2 mg dose)  
The clinical development program for the 2 mg dose in the indication "diabetic macular 
edema (DME)" is comprised of 4 studies. 
In 2006, the clinical development program was initiated by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
with the start of the Phase I study VGFT-OD-0512. In this safety and tolerability study of 
IVT administered VEGF Trap-Eye in 5 patients with DME, a single 4 mg IVT dose of VEGF 
Trap-Eye was well tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Ocular adverse events 
(AEs) were mild, and none of the AEs were considered to be related to the study medication. 
No patient had detectible anti-VEGF Trap-Eye antibodies. Excess retinal thickness (ERT) and 
total macular volume decreased, and VA improved relative to baseline values. 
In the Phase II, double-masked, randomized, controlled study DA VINCI (VGFT-OD-0706) 
of the safety, tolerability and biological effect of repeated IVT administration of VEGF 
Trap-Eye in patients with clinically significant DME, 2 doses of IVT administered VEGF 
Trap-Eye (0.5 and 2 mg) at 3 different dosing schedules (every 4 and 8 weeks, PRN) were 
compared to macular laser photocoagulation. A total of 221 subjects were randomized and 
219 treated. Treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye was superior to laser therapy for the treatment of 
DME over 24 weeks and 52 weeks. At Week 24, treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye resulted in 
statistically significantly better mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) outcomes (gain of 
+8.5 to +11.4 letters), and greater mean reductions in retinal thickness (-127.3 μm to -
194.5 μm) compared to the laser arm (gain of 2.5 letters and reduction of -67.9 μm, 
respectively). At Week 52, treatment with VEGF Trap-Eye continued to show greater mean 
BCVA outcomes (gain of +9.7 to +13.1 letters) and greater mean reductions in retinal 
thickness (-165.4 μm to -227.4 μm) compared to the laser arm (-1.3 letters and -58.4 μm, 
respectively). 
Considering data from the AMD program and from the DA VINCI study, the dose advanced 
into the Phase III DME program (VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME) was 2 mg, and the dose 
regimens were every 4 weeks, and every 8 weeks (after 5 initial monthly doses). Although the 
DA VINCI study was not designed to distinguish among treatment groups, it was noted that a 
greater proportion of patients lost vision from baseline at Week 52 in the 0.5 mg group as 
opposed to the 2Q4 group. This further supported the decision to move forward with the 2 mg 
dose in DME, evaluating 2Q4 and 2Q8 regimens. The additional dose group studied in the 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
DA VINCI study was 2 mg PRN, in which patients received as needed dosing after 3 initial 
monthly doses, but were required to be monitored on a monthly basis through Week 52. The 
2Q8 and 2PRN groups ended up receiving a similar number of injections and had similar 
visual acuity and anatomic outcomes. In practice, the 2Q8 regimen would result in a lower 
burden of monitoring, and therefore the 2Q8 regimen was considered more practical than the 
2PRN regimen. In addition, every 8-week dosing paradigm has an advantage over the 
PRN dosing regimen in that treatment is delivered on a proactive basis and not in response to 
recurrence of disease. Therefore, it was decided not to move forward with the PRN dosing 
regimen in the Phase III DME program. Fluctuations in the 2Q8 group in CRT after the 
Q8 interval began led to the inclusion of an additional monthly dose in the Phase III 
DME program. This was done in an attempt to enhance the maintenance of CRT reduction 
once the maximum decrease in CRT was attained and augment the improvement in BCVA 
over the Q8 treatment interval. The addition of an extra dose (at Week 12) deferred the start 
of the first Q8 interval from week 8 to week 16, resulting in 5 initial monthly doses. 
A total of 872 patients were randomized and 865 patients (=SAF) treated in the pivotal 
Phase III DME studies VIVID-DME (404 subjects) and VISTA-DME (461 subjects). 
Consistently in both studies, Eylea administered 2Q4 and 2Q8 was shown to be superior to 
laser treatment with regard to the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis, i.e., the change from 
baseline in mean ETDRS letter score at Week 52, analysed for the FAS using the LOCF 
approach. All supportive sensitivity analyses conducted to assess the robustness of these 
results confirmed the findings of the primary analysis. Also, in the analyses of the secondary 
efficacy variables the results for all visual acuity and anatomic efficacy variables supported 
the conclusion drawn from the primary variable that treatment with 2 mg Eylea once every 
4 weeks or once every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses is superior to laser 
treatment. 
Results through Week 100 (2-year analysis) and through Week 148 (3-year analysis) of the 
studies supported the primary, secondary, and additional endpoints analysed at Week 52 and 
showed that the effects of treatment with Eylea were maintained in all VA and anatomic 
endpoints. 
The pooled safety analysis of the pivotal Phase III studies through Week 148 showed that 
Eylea was generally well tolerated. 
The overall TEAE rate was without any notable difference compared to the laser treatment. 
However, since in the laser group, 85% of patients received additional or PRN treatment with 
VTE, the comparison of AE occurrence between laser and the VTE combined group is of 
limited value and conclusions should be drawn with caution in the outer years of the studies. 
There were no differences compared to laser photocoagulation in the incidence of ocular or 
non-ocular TEAEs which raise safety concerns, e.g., the differences in drug-related non-
ocular/ocular TEAEs, injection procedure-related ocular TEAEs, and non-ocular serious 
TEAEs. 
In general, TEAEs consistent with the injection procedure were more common in the Eylea 
groups, whereas TEAEs consistent with disease worsening were more common in the laser 
group. 
The most common ocular TEAEs in the study eye were "conjunctival haemorrhage", 
"cataract", and "eye pain". Most ocular TEAEs had a mild or moderate intensity; few were 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept)

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
severe in intensity or were serious. The most common non-ocular TEAEs were 
"hypertension", "nasopharyngitis", "urinary tract infection", and "anaemia". In general, the 
frequencies of these events were similar between the Eylea groups and the laser group. Most 
non-ocular TEAEs had a maximum intensity of mild or moderate. The overall frequency of 
treatment-emergent APTC events was low and within the expected range in the DME 
population (22 patients [7.7%] in the laser group, 31 patients [10.7%] in the 2Q4 group, and 
21patients [7.3%] in the 2Q8 group). Any deaths through Week 148 were reported in 8 
subjects (2.8%) in the laser group, 19 subjects (6.5%) in the 2Q4 group, and 13 subjects 
(4.5%) in the 2Q8 group. The causes of the deaths were consistent with the demographics and 
predisposition of the population being studied. No new ADRs were reported in the 
DME studies compared with those reported in the AMD studies in the initial marketing 
authorization application or the CRVO studies in the first supplemental authorization 
application. 
Based on the week 52/week 100 results and the favourable benefit/risk balance, Eylea was 
approved in the US (JUL 2014) and EU (AUG 2014) for the indication DME. 
Two further completed DME studies are considered in this RMP version for the calculation of 
exposure and the assessment of safety of Eylea in DME patients: VIVID-JAPAN (SN: 15657) 
was an open-label, single-arm Phase III study in 72 evaluable Japanese DME patients, who 
were treated with Eylea 2Q8 after 5 initial doses at monthly intervals through Week 48. The 
other study, VIVID-EAST (SN 15161), was a randomized controlled Phase III study over one 
year in mostly Asian patients with the same design as in the first year of the pivotal Phase III 
studies (VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME). In both studies, the safety and efficacy results at 
Week 52 were generally consistent with those observed after one year in the pivotal Phase III 
studies.

The development of the 8 mg application of aflibercept included a Phase II/III study: 
The randomized, double-masked, active-controlled Phase II/III PHOTON study is ongoing, 
week 48 results are displayed in this RMP. The primary objective of this study was to 
determine if treatment with 8 mg aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provides 
noninferior BCVA compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks. Secondary objectives 
are to determine the effect of 8 mg versus 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and other visual 
measures of response, to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of 8 mg 
aflibercept. 
Patients were randomized to one of the following groups: 
•  2 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 8 weeks (2q8) after 5 initial injections at 4-week 
intervals  
•  8 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 12 weeks (HDq12) after 3 initial injections at 
4-week intervals 
•  8 mg intravitreal aflibercept every 16 weeks (HDq16) after 3 initial injections at 
4-week intervals 
Week 48 results of the PHOTON study were based on 167 patients in the 2Q8 group, 
328 patients in the HDq12 group, and 163 patients in the HDq16 group (these patients were 
valid for both the SAF and FAS analyses). The primary endpoint analysis (i.e., change from 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
baseline in BCVA as measured by ETDRS letter score) at Week 48 showed that the primary 
efficacy endpoint was met: Both HD groups demonstrated non-inferiority to 2Q8 using the 
non-inferiority (NI) margin of 4 letters with LS mean change from baseline in BCVA of 
8.10 letters (HDq12) and 7.23 letters (HDq16), respectively versus 8.67 letters in the 
2Q8 group. Treatment differences (CI) were -0.57 (-2.26, 1.13) and -1.44 (-3.27, 0.39) for 
HDq12 and HDq16, respectively compared to 2Q8. The robustness of these results for the 
primary endpoint were supported by the sensitivity analyses, including analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint in the PPS. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants with a ≥2 step 
improvement in DRSS score at week 48. This treatment goal was achieved in 90/310 patients 
(29.0%) in the HDq12 group, 30/153 patients (19.6%) in the HDq16 group, and 42/158 
patients (26.6%) in the 2Q8 group. The NI margin was prespecified at 15%. While that 
margin was met for HDQ12 vs. 2Q8 (the adjusted difference [95%-CI] In CMH-weighted 
estimates was 1.98% [-6.61; 10.57]; i.e., even a 10% NI margin was met), HDq16 vs. 2Q8 
failed to show non-inferiority, since the adjusted treatment difference was -7.52% with an 
accompanying 95%-CI of [-16.88; 1.84]. However, the HDq16 group had more participants 
with moderate to mild (level 43 or better) retinopathy at baseline with the majority of 
participants in all treatment groups having a baseline DRSS score of level 35. The descriptive 
analyses of the additional secondary endpoints evaluated at Week 48 suggested similar 
outcomes on treatment with 8 mg compared to 2Q8. 
Overall, treatment with HD aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provided non-inferior 
BCVA compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks. Treatment with 8 mg was 
well-tolerated and both the ocular and systemic safety profile of 8 mg was similar to 2 mg. No 
new safety signals were identified. 
SIII.1.6  Development in the indication “retinopathy of prematurity” (ROP), 
(Eylea 40mg/mL, 0.4 mg dose) 
The clinical development program with intravitreal aflibercept (EYLEA) for the treatment of 
ROP was designed to collect prospective, randomized, controlled data for EYLEA in the 
vulnerable population of preterm infants in medical need due to a severe, vision-threatening 
disease requiring timely and adequate treatment. This clinical development program consisted 
of one completed pivotal Phase III study 20090 (FIREFLEYE) and the ongoing Phase IIIb 
Study 20275 (FIREFLEYE NEXT, extension study).  
The FIREFLEYE study was an open-label, randomized, two–arm, controlled Phase III study 
to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IVT aflibercept compared to laser 
photocoagulation in patients with ROP. Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive treatment 
with an IVT injection of aflibercept 0.4 mg/0.01 mL or laser photocoagulation. Study duration 
was at least 24 weeks in the study protocol.  
One or both eyes could be treated according to the investigator’s assessment of the study’s 
eligibility criteria. Retreatment(s) with the subject’s randomized treatment, or rescue 
treatment (laser for the aflibercept arm; aflibercept for the laser arm) were allowed if the 
specified criteria are met during the 23-week treatment period. 
A total of 121 subjects were screened and 118 subjects were randomized, 75 to aflibercept 
and 43 to the laser arm. Five subjects randomized to the laser treatment arm were withdrawn 
before treatment was administered. Therefore, 75 (100%) subjects were treated with 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
aflibercept and 38 (88.4%) with laser. All 113 treated subjects (75 in aflibercept and 38 in 
laser treatment arm) were considered valid for both efficacy (FAS) and the safety (SAF) 
analyses. A majority of subjects in both treatment arms were bilaterally treated (71 [94.7%] in 
the aflibercept arm and 34 [79.1%] in the laser arm). 
The number of male subjects (54.7%) was slightly higher than female subjects (45.3%) in the 
aflibercept treatment arm (whereas it was equally distributed in the laser treatment arm, 
50% males, 50% females). The majority of subjects were White (73.5%), while 23.0% were 
Asian (of which 14.2% were from Japan). At the time of treatment, the mean chronological 
age was 10.3 weeks and the mean body weight was 1965.3 g (mean weight at the time of 
birth: 862.1 g).  
The primary efficacy outcome for this study was to evaluate the proportion of subjects with 
absence of active ROP and unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study 
treatment. Using a Bayesian model, the estimated response probability (median of the 
posterior distribution) for meeting the response criterion “absence of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks” was 85.5% in the aflibercept treatment arm 
and 82.1% for the laser treatment arm. As the 90% credible interval for the treatment 
difference does not exclude -5%, non-inferiority of aflibercept compared to laser treatment 
(pre-defined success criterion) could not be concluded, although the aflibercept arm 
numerically showed slightly better outcomes. 
As a secondary efficacy endpoint, requirement for intervention with a second treatment 
modality from baseline to week 24 was evaluated. A second treatment modality for ROP was 
either rescue treatment as defined in the protocol or any other surgical or nonsurgical 
treatment for ROP (e.g., IVT anti-VEGF injection, ablative laser therapy, cryotherapy, or 
vitrectomy) after study start. Using a Bayesian model, the estimated median response 
probability for subjects requiring an intervention with a second modality from baseline until 
Week 24 was 7.2% in the aflibercept arm and 9.6% in the laser arm. 
The proportion of subjects with ocular AEs and TEAEs in the study eye was overall 
comparable in the two treatment arms (aflibercept: 38.7%; laser: 36.8%). The most frequent 
ocular TEAEs by MedDRA PT in treated eyes (>5% in either treatment arm) were retinal 
haemorrhage (aflibercept 6.7% vs. laser 13.2%), retinal detachment (aflibercept 5.3% vs laser 
5.3%), conjunctival haemorrhage (aflibercept 5.3% vs. laser 0%), and eyelid oedema 
(aflibercept 2.7%; laser 7.9%) in the eye disorders SOC; and conjunctivitis (aflibercept 4.0%, 
laser 10.5%) in the infections and infestations SOC.  
The proportion of subjects reported with ocular SAEs was 13.3% for aflibercept and 7.9% for 
laser, and for ocular TESAEs 8.0% and 7.9%, respectively. Non-ocular (systemic) TEAEs 
were more pronounced in the laser treatment arm (aflibercept 52.0% vs. laser 63.2%) and 
reflect the underlying prematurity of the study population with typical comorbidities in both 
treatment arms. The proportion of subjects reported with systemic SAEs was 24.0% for 
aflibercept vs. 36.8% for laser, and the proportion of subjects with systemic TESAEs was 
6.7% for aflibercept and 18.4% for laser. There were 3 subjects in the aflibercept treatment 
arm with a fatal outcome due to AEs which occurred in context of complications of the 
underlying prematurity related comorbidities, assessed as unrelated to the study treatment.  
Overall, the safety data in FIREFLEYE is consistent with the established safety profile of 
Eylea and no new safety concern has been identified.

The data from the 6-month Phase 3 Study FIREFLEYE suggest a favourable benefit-risk 
profile for IVT aflibercept in the treatment of premature infants with severe ROP. 
All treated patients from Study 20090 must be offered participation in a follow-up study 
20275 (FIREFLEYE NEXT, Phase IIIb extension study) until they are 5 years of age to assess 
long-term ocular effects, clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Subjects will be 
followed until the age of 5 years, when detailed assessment of visual function and overall 
development becomes feasible and stable. This study is ongoing and the interim safety data 
are considered for this RMP version. 
SIII.2  Clinical Trial Exposure 
SIII.2.1 
Introduction and overview of studies considered for the calculation of 
exposure 
Clinical trial exposure showing the overall number of patients by study, by treatment 
duration, dose, number of injections, demographics, age, gender, ethnicity, and special 
populations are shown in Table SIII.1 through Table SIII.38. The overall clinical exposure 
includes data from treated subjects in 11 Phase I-IV studies in wet AMD (including the 2 mg 
and 8 mg doses), 2 Phase III studies in CRVO, the single BRVO Phase III study, the 
single-Phase III study in myopic CNV, 7 Phase I-III studies in DME (including the 2 mg and 
8 mg doses), and the single Phase III study in ROP. 
Exposure data in special populations are exclusively shown for the 2 pivotal randomized 
Phase III wet AMD studies (VIEW 1 and 2), the 2 Phase III CRVO studies (GALILEO and 
COPERNICUS), the Phase III BRVO study (VIBRANT), the Phase III trial in myopic CNV 
(MYRROR), the 2 controlled Phase III DME studies (VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME),  the 
Phase III ROP study (FIREFLEYE), and the two 8 mg aflibercept AMD studies (CANDELA 
and PULSAR) and the 8 mg aflibercept DME (PHOTON) study. 
A summary of patient exposure to Eylea IVT injections for wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, 
myopic CNV, DME, and ROP in the various clinical trials is provided in Table SIII.1. This 
table includes the number of patients who switched from one dose to another one within the 
same study according to protocol, or with enrolment into a follow-up long-term safety study 
(i.e., VGFT-OD-0702). In addition, this table includes patients that were treated in the 8 mg 
aflibercept wet AMD (CANDELA and PULSAR) and 8 mg aflibercept DME (PHOTON) 
studies. 
In the 11 Phase I-IV wet AMD studies, 2 Phase III CRVO studies, one Phase III BRVO study, 
one Phase III myopic CNV study, 7 Phase I-III DME studies, and one Phase III ROP study, a 
total of 11,186 patients have been enrolled; with 6,487 thereof having received Eylea 
injections at various doses of 0.4 mg for preterm infants, ≤1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg in adult 
patients (see Table SIII.1). For this clinical trial exposure overview, the wet AMD Phase I-II 
studies, final 96 weeks data from the VIEW 1 and 2 studies, the final data from the VIEW 1 
extension study VGFT-OD-0910, the final data from the completed Phase I/II extension study 
VGFT-OD-0702, the final 1-year data from the completed SIGHT study3, as well as the 
44-week data from the CANDELA Phase II 8 mg aflibercept study and the 48-week data from 
3 Please note that the SIGHT study, which is included in the calculation of clinical trial exposure, is not part of 
the EU submission as it solely relates to Chinese patients with AMD.

the PULSAR Phase III 8 mg aflibercept study were considered. For CRVO, the final 76 and 
100 weeks data from the Phase III CRVO studies (GALILEO and COPERNICUS trials, 
respectively) were considered. For BRVO, the final study data of VIBRANT up to Week 52 
are included. The myopic CNV indication is represented by final 48 weeks data of the Phase 
III MYRROR study. For DME, final data of the following studies are considered: Phase I 
study VGFT-OD-0512, Phase II study DAVINCI, single-arm, open-label Phase III study 
VIVID-JAPAN, pivotal Phase III studies VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME, and Phase III study 
VIVID-EAST. Additionally, the 48-week data from the PHOTON Phase II/III 8 mg 
aflibercept study are presented. For ROP the Phase III FIREFLEYE study data was 
considered. 
SIII.2.1.1  Brief description of wet AMD studies 
A total of 6,903 patients were enrolled and 3,787 patients exposed to Eylea in the Phase I-IV 
wet AMD studies (see Table SIII.1): 
VGFT-OD-0502 was a Phase I study, with 3 parts (A, B and C), of single IVT injections of 
up to 4 mg of Eylea in patients with wet AMD (12-week active observation, 1 year 
follow-up). 
VGFT-OD-0508 (CLEAR-IT) was a Phase II study of repeated IVT injections of doses of up 
to 4 mg per injection in patients with wet AMD (12-week fixed dosing every 4 weeks (Q4) or 
Q12, followed by 52 weeks with dosing as needed). 
VGFT-OD-0603 was a Phase I study of repeated IVT injections of 4 mg per dose in patients 
with wet AMD (8 weeks for first 3 doses, up to 9 months, if treatment was required 
thereafter). 
VGFT-OD-0605 (VIEW 1) was a randomized, controlled Phase III study of repeated IVT 
injections of 0.5 mg and 2 mg Eylea versus ranibizumab for 2 years in patients with wet 
AMD. 
VGFT-OD-0910 [SN 14832] was an open-label extension study (sponsored by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) subsequent to VIEW 1 in order to enable patients who had completed 
2 years of treatment in VIEW 1 to continue (or to initiate) therapy with Eylea 2 mg, for an 
additional mean treatment duration of approximately 110 weeks. A total of 320 patients 
completed VIEW 1 and were subsequently treated with Eylea in the study eye (2 mg at 
individual intervals ranging from 4 to 12 weeks) during the extension study (69 patients from 
the former ranibizumab group and 87/92/72 patients from the former Eylea 0.5 Q4/2Q4/2Q8 
treatment groups). Three subjects enrolled in the VIEW 1 extension study received Eylea 
2 mg at Week 96 in the original VIEW 1 study (not counted for the VIEW 1 study exposure) 
but did not receive further treatment in the extension study. These 3 patients are considered 
for the safety analyses in the VIEW 1 extension study (increased SAF: 323, i.e., 69 and 
87/95/72 per treatment group), and the 3 active injections at Week 96 are considered for the 
calculation of the AMD and overall exposure across studies. Exposure data from VIEW 1 and 
the extension study were pooled for the description of exposure in VIEW 1 (see Table SIII.1). 
311523/91689 (VIEW 2) was a randomized, controlled Phase III study of repeated IVT 
injections of 0.5 mg and 2 mg Eylea versus ranibizumab for 2 years in patients with wet 
AMD.

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
VGFT-OD-0702 was a randomized, single-masked, long-term, safety, and tolerability study 
of IVT Eylea in Subjects with wet AMD. Subjects enrolled in the original studies 
VGFT-OD-0502, VGFT-OD-0508, or VGFT-OD-00603 continued to receive Eylea in this 
study with a follow up period of up to 3 years. A total of 157 patients were enrolled and 
149 patients randomized (50 to the vial group and 99 to the PFS group). Patients in study 
VGFT-OD-0702 are counted once for the exposure tables below and are included in exposure 
data of their initial study assignment. 
SIGHT (SN 13406) was a randomized, double-masked, photodynamic therapy-controlled 
Phase III study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of VEGF Trap-Eye in Chinese subjects 
with wet AMD. The primary endpoint (mean change in BCVA) was assessed at 28 weeks, 
while the study had a total follow-up of 52 weeks. The study had 2 treatment arms. Patients in 
the Eylea arm were treated with 2 mg Eylea every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, thereafter 
every 8 weeks until the end of the trial. Subjects in the PDT group underwent one PDT 
procedure at Baseline and then additional procedures as indicated according to local clinical 
practice and the clinical judgment of the investigator. These subjects crossed over to active 
VEGF Trap-Eye treatment after the primary efficacy assessments at Week 28. Thus, the Eylea 
exposure is calculated based on the 229 patients initially randomized to Eylea plus 70 patients 
of the original PDT group who were switched to Eylea after Week 28 (i.e., 299 patients in 
total). 
ALTAIR (SN 17668) was a randomized, open-label phase IV study evaluating the efficacy 
and safety of repeated doses of intravitreal aflibercept with variable treatment intervals in 
Japanese subjects with wet AMD for up to 2 years. The Treat and Extend regimen was a 
dosing strategy where the injection interval could be gradually extended as long as functional 
and anatomic stability of a patient was maintained. The interval could also be shortened if the 
physician saw deterioration of the patient´s condition. After a run-in phase consisting of 
3 monthly doses and a 4th dose given after 8 weeks, 247 patients were randomly assigned to 
one of the two treatment arms of the study. Depending on various adjustment criteria, the dose 
regimen was shortened or extended per individual patient for 2 or 4 weeks (124 subjects in the 
2-week [2W] adjustment group, 123 subjects in the 4-week [4W] adjustment group, and 
7 subjects failed to be randomized). The 1-year data from both of these groups are considered 
for this RMP version. The ALTAIR study can help guide physicians in optimizing individual 
treatment while minimizing over- and under-treatment. 
All Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) data concerned with wet AMD utilized in this RMP (other 
than in this exposure module) are mainly based on the final global integrated analysis of the 
final 96 weeks dataset of the VIEW 1 and 2 studies; safety results from the VIEW 1 extension 
study VGFT-OD-0910 as well as from SIGHT and ALTAIR are reported separately. 
Two 8 mg aflibercept AMD studies CANDELA and PULSAR were conducted and are 
described below. The PULSAR study is ongoing.  
CANDELA (VGFTe-HD-AMD-1905, SN 21086) was a randomized, single-masked, active-
controlled Phase II study sponsored by Bayer AG’s license partner and Marketing 
Authorization Holder (MAH) in the USA Regeneron Pharmaceuticals INC. A total of 106 
eligible patients was randomized into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. One group received 2 mg 
aflibercept and the other 8 mg aflibercept. Aflibercept was administered intravitreally 
monthly for 3 initial injections at baseline, week 4 and week 8, followed by additional doses 
at weeks 20 and 32. At weeks 24, 28, 36 and 40 patients were evaluated and given a dose

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
(at their randomized dose level) if defined retreatment criteria were met. The primary safety 
analysis took place at week 20, with exploratory endpoints evaluated at week 20 and week 44. 
The study was completed. 
PULSAR (SN 20968) is a randomized, double-masked, active-controlled Phase III study 
sponsored by Bayer AG. 1011 participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into one of 
three parallel groups. One group receives 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks, one group receives 
8 mg aflibercept every 12 weeks and the third group receives 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks 
(each group after 3 initial monthly injections). The primary endpoint is change from baseline 
in BCVA measured by ETDRS letter score at week 48. Key secondary endpoints are change 
from baseline in BCVA measured by ETDRS letter score at week 60 and the proportion of 
participants with no intraretinal fluid and no subretinal fluid in central subfield at week 16. 
48-week exposure and safety data are included in this RMP version. The study is still 
ongoing. 
The two 8 mg aflibercept wet AMD studies CANDELA and PULSAR are integrated in the 
exposure analyses provided in this module. 
Wet AMD and DME safety data of the 8 mg aflibercept program are integrated and the 
pooled wet AMD/DME 8 mg aflibercept safety data (CANDELA/PHOTON/PULSAR) are 
displayed in the respective risk sections of this RMP. 
SIII.2.1.2  Brief description of CRVO studies 
During the 76/100 weeks duration of the 2 Phase III CRVO studies, a total of 513 patients 
were enrolled, of these, 317 patients received Eylea injections (see Table SIII.1). 
VGFT-OD-0819 (COPERNICUS) was a randomized, double masked, controlled Phase III 
study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated IVT administration of Eylea in 
subjects with macular edema secondary to CRVO. In the first 6-months, subjects received 
either 2 mg Eylea every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4) for 20 weeks, or sham injections every 4 weeks 
for 20 weeks. In the second 6-month period (Week 24 through Week 52), subjects were 
evaluated every 4 weeks and received either Eylea 2 mg injections or sham injections in 
accordance with protocol-defined re-treatment criteria. Thus, patients randomized to only 
receive sham through Week 20 were able to receive active Eylea 2 mg injections from 
Week 24 to Week 52 if they met re-treatment criteria. In COPERNICUS, starting at Week 52, 
all subjects were eligible to receive treatment with Eylea to Week 100 in an unmasked 1-year 
extension phase comprising "as-needed" (PRN) treatment. In this phase of the study, subjects 
were evaluated quarterly (i.e., every 3 months) and received 2 mg Eylea IVT according to the 
study re-treatment criteria. No sham injections were performed during this phase. 
Study No. 14130 (GALILEO) was a randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled Phase III 
study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated IVT administration of Eylea in 
subjects with macular edema secondary to CRVO. In the first 6-months, subjects received 
either 2 mg Eylea every 4 weeks (Eylea 2Q4) for 20 weeks, or sham injections every 4 weeks 
for 20 weeks. Starting Week 24 through Week 52, subjects in the Eylea group received either 
Eylea 2 mg injections or sham injections according to protocol-defined re-treatment criteria, 
while subjects in the sham group continued to receive only sham injections until Week 52. In 
GALILEO, starting at Week 52, all subjects were eligible to receive treatment with 
Eylea/sham to Week 76 in a masked 6-month PRN extension phase. In this phase of the study, 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
subjects were evaluated every 8 weeks and received either 2 mg Eylea IVT or sham injections 
according to the study re-treatment criteria. 
In this RMP version, the final data up to Week 76 (GALILEO) and Week 100 
(COPERNICUS) from both of the above CRVO studies is included. 
SIII.2.1.3  Brief description of BRVO study 
VIBRANT (SN 15432, VGFTe RVO-1027) was a randomized, double-masked, active 
controlled 52-week study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated 
IVT administration of Eylea compared with grid laser photocoagulation in subjects with 
macular edema secondary to BRVO. Macular grid laser photocoagulation was chosen as 
comparator treatment, because at the time of inception of VIBRANT in 2012 it could be 
regarded as representative standard of care treatment in macular edema secondary to BRVO. 
A total of 183 patients (281 enrolled) were randomized: 91 patients to treatment with Eylea 
and 92 patients to treatment with laser (see Table SIII.1). Study treatment in the 2 treatment 
arms was scheduled as follows: 
Eylea arm: Patients received Eylea 2 mg every 4 weeks (2Q4) through (including) Week 24, 
then every 8 weeks (2Q8) through Week 48. Sham IVT injections were administered every 8 
weeks starting from Week 28, alternating with Eylea injections every 8 weeks, through 
Week 44. The last active injection with Eylea was on Week 48. Patients in the Eylea group 
also received one sham laser treatment on Day 1. Rescue treatment with active laser in this 
group was possible, if patients meet the pre-defined laser rescue treatment criteria at Week 36. 
Laser arm: Patients received grid laser photocoagulation treatment at Day 1, and sham IVT 
injections every 4 weeks from Day 1 through Week 48. Rescue treatment with laser was 
possible from Week 12 onwards (minimum intervals of 12 weeks from previous laser 
treatment) in those patients who met the pre-specified rescue treatment criteria. Patients in the 
laser arm became generally eligible for rescue treatment with Eylea beginning at Week 24. 
This rescue treatment had to be started with 3 initial active injections every 4 weeks, followed 
by 2 mg injections every 8 weeks. 
In this RMP version, the final study data up to Week 52 (last active treatment on Week 48) 
are included. A total of 67 patients randomized to the laser arm additionally received rescue 
treatment with Eylea from Week 24 onwards, thus a total of 158 patients were exposed to 
Eylea in the VIBRANT study. 
SIII.2.1.4  Brief description of myopic CNV study 
Study No. 15170 (MYRROR) was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, 
sham-controlled study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Eylea in patients with 
choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia. In the first 24-week period of 
the study, patients received either one mandatory 2 mg Eylea IVT injection at Baseline 
followed by sham injections every 4 weeks, which could be replaced by additional active 
injections in case of recurring or persisting CNV, or sham injections every 4 weeks only. In 
the next study period (Week 24 through Week 44), patients in both treatment arms (i.e., incl. 
patients in the sham group) were allowed to receive Eylea treatment in case of recurring or 
persisting CNV. Initially, all patients in the sham group received one mandatory active 
injection at Week 24. Patients continued to be evaluated monthly until Week 48 (the last 
active injection could be administered at Week 44). Overall, a total of 122 patients were 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
randomized; of these, 91 received Eylea injections before completion of the primary endpoint 
assessment at Week 24, while 31 patients were randomized to sham treatment. 25 original 
sham patients actually received at least one active injection with Eylea at Week 24, thus the 
number of patients exposed to Eylea in the MYRROR study accumulated to 116 patients in 
total (see Table SIII.1). 
In this RMP version, the final study data through Week 48 are presented. 
SIII.2.1.5  Brief description of DME studies 
A total of 3,195 patients were enrolled and 2,030 patients exposed to Eylea in the DME 
studies (see Table SIII.1). 
VGFT-OD-0512 (SN: 14805) was a Phase I, single dose study to assess the safety and 
tolerability of IVT administered VEGF Trap-Eye in 5 patients with DME, who were exposed 
to a single 4 mg IVT dose of VEGF Trap-Eye. 
VGFT-OD-0706 (DA VINCI; SN: 13336) was a randomized, double-masked, controlled 
Phase II study of the safety, tolerability, and biological effect of repeated IVT administration 
of VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects with DME with central involvement, and a BCVA of 20/40 to 
20/320 (letter score of 73 to 24). A total of 221 patients were enrolled and 219 treated in the 
United States, Canada, and Austria. End of treatment was at Week 52 (followed by a safety 
observation phase up to Week 76). Subjects were randomized to 1 of the following 
5 treatment groups: 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (0.5q4) to week 52, 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg every 4 weeks (2q4) to week 52, 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg every 8 weeks (2q8) after 3 monthly loading doses, with sham 
injections at alternating visits, to week 52, 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg PRN after 3 monthly loading doses, according to the VEGF 
Trap-Eye re-treatment criteria, with sham injections at visits at which VEGF Trap-Eye 
re-treatment criteria were not met, and  
•  Laser photocoagulation, using the modified ETDRS technique at week 1, and 1 week 
after visits at which patients met laser re-treatment criteria, to week 52; sham 
injections every 4 weeks at each study visit; laser re-treatment was permitted no more 
than once every 16 weeks ± 3 days. 
VGFT-OD-1009 (VISTA-DME) was a 3-year, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, 
multicenter Phase III clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of IVT VEGF 
Trap-Eye in subjects with DME with central involvement, and a BCVA of 20/40 to 20/320 
(letter score of 73 to 24). In VISTA-DME, a total of 461 subjects (SAF) were treated in the 
US. 4 
BAY 86-5321/91745 (VIVID-DME) was a 3-year, randomized, double-masked, 
active-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of repeated 
4 As per amendment No. 4, patients completing Visit 39 (Week 148) in VISTA-DME were allowed to receive 
further treatment extension with Eylea until the planned date for the last on-study patient to complete Visit 39 
(NOV 2014) in order to avoid a potential treatment gap between study end and availability of commercial Eylea. 
However, the exposure and safety analyses in VISTA-DME are aligned with VIVID-DME and thus limited to 
the last core study visit (i.e., Week 148).

doses of IVT VEGF Trap-Eye in subjects with DME with central involvement, and a BCVA 
of 20/40 to 20/320 (letter score of 73 to 24). In VIVID-DME, a total of 404 subjects (SAF) 
were treated in European countries, Australia, and Japan. VISTA-DME and VIVID-DME had 
nearly identical overall study designs and are described together, unless otherwise indicated. 
Patients in either study were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg every 4 weeks (2Q4) to Week 144, 
•  VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg every 8 weeks (2Q8) after 5 monthly loading doses, with sham 
injections at alternating visits, to Week 144, 
•  Laser photocoagulation through week 144. 
•  Subjects in the VEGF Trap-Eye groups received sham laser at baseline and at visits at 
which subjects met the criteria for laser re-treatment (no more often than every 
12 weeks). Subjects in all groups were assessed for additional treatment (i.e., VEGF 
Trap-Eye for the laser subjects and laser for the VEGF Trap-Eye subjects) for 
inadequate responders at each visit starting with week 24. Additional treatment was to 
be administered if either of the criteria were met: 
•  A loss of ≥15 letters from the best previous BCVA score due to DME with current 
BCVA score not better than baseline, 
•  A loss of ≥10 letters at 2 consecutive visits at least 7 days apart from the best previous 
BCVA score due to DME with current BCVA score not better than baseline. 
•  During Year 3, subjects randomized to the laser group who did not meet the criteria 
for additional treatment previously could receive VEGF Trap-Eye as needed (PRN) 
according to the VEGF Trap Eye re-treatment criteria from Week 100 to Week 144. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the change in ETDRS letter score 
from baseline to week 52. Efficacy (visual function) was assessed using the ETDRS 
protocol at 4 meters at each study visit. Other measures of efficacy included change in 
CRT as measured by OCT, improvement in ETDRS Diabetic Retinopathy Severity 
Scale (DRSS) using fundus photography and fluorescein angiography (FA), and 
questionnaires to examine vision-related quality of life. Overall safety was assessed by 
monitoring/evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), physical 
examinations, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and clinical safety laboratory tests. 
Ocular safety was assessed by ophthalmic examinations (slit lamp biomicroscopy, 
indirect ophthalmoscopy, intraocular pressure, OCT), and FP and FA. Last study 
assessment was on Week 148. 
Fellow eye treatment for DME with anti-VEGF agents was allowed in both Phase III 
studies. In VIVID-DME, standard of care was used (including ranibizumab or 
bevacizumab; licensed treatment preferred). In VISTA DME, VEGF Trap-Eye was 
provided and required as fellow eye treatment; (although ranibizumab could be used. 
used if VEGF Trap-Eye was unavailable due to logistical reasons). 
BAY 86-5321/15161 (VIVID-EAST) was designed similarly to VIVID-DME and 
VISTA-DME and was conducted in 25 centres in China, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, and 
the Russian Federation. Eligible patients were randomized to the laser group (N=124), the 
Eylea 2Q4 group (N=127), or the Eylea 2Q8 group (N=127). Patients in the laser group were 
treated with laser photocoagulation at baseline and from week 12 onwards, if laser 
re-treatment criteria were met. Patients in the Eylea 2Q4 group received Eylea 2 mg at 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept)

Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
monthly intervals continuously through Week 48, and patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group 
received Eylea 2 mg every 2 months following 5 initial injections at monthly intervals (i.e., 
from Baseline to including Week 16) through Week 48. Additional treatment (with Eylea in 
the laser group or with laser in the Eylea groups) was permitted from Week 24 onwards. The 
final study assessments were performed at Week 52. 
BAY 86-5321/15657 (VIVID-JAPAN) was an open-label, Phase III study evaluating the 
safety and tolerability of repeated doses of IVT VEGF Trap-Eye in 73 Japanese patients with 
DME (SAF: 72 patients, since one treated patient withdrew informed consent and thus was 
excluded from the SAF). As with the randomized Phase III studies in the 2Q8 group, all 
patients in VIVID-JAPAN were treated in an open-label fashion with Eylea every 2 months 
(2Q8) after 5 initial doses at monthly intervals (i.e., 2Q4 up to Week 16). Last treatment was 
on Week 48; the final endpoint assessments were performed at Week 52. No additional 
treatment of the study eye with laser was permitted. Fellow eye treatment was allowed as per 
local standard of care/medical routine. Systemic concentrations of free and bound VEGF Trap 
were measured at pre-defined time points during the study period. 
In this RMP version, the exposure data of the aforementioned 6 Phase I-III studies are used 
for the description of clinical trial exposure. Safety data of 2 mg aflibercept in DME are 
primarily derived from the pooled data set of the pivotal studies VIVID-DME and VISTA-
DME through Week 148, while complementary safety results from VIVID-JAPAN and 
VIVID-EAST are described separately. 
Moreover, this RMP version includes the 48-week results from the Phase II/III study 
PHOTON (VGFTe-HD-DME-1934, SN 21091), in which the aflibercept 8 mg dose was 
investigated for treatment of DME. This study is a randomized, double-masked and 
active-controlled study. Patients were randomized into one of three parallel treatment groups 
(1:2:1 ratio). One group receives 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly 
doses, one group receives 8 mg aflibercept every 12 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses 
and the third group receives 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly 
injections. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in BCVA at week 48. Key 
secondary endpoints are the proportion of patients without retinal fluid at the foveal centre at 
week 12, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 2 step improvement in DRSS at week 48 and 
change from baseline in BCVA at week 60. The study is ongoing.  
DME and wet AMD safety data of the 8 mg aflibercept development program were integrated 
and the 48 week pooled wet AMD/DME safety data (CANDELA/PHOTON/PULSAR) are 
displayed in the respective risks sections of this RMP. 
SIII.2.1.6  Brief description of ROP studies 
FIREFLEYE (SN 20090) was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two arm, 
controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IVT aflibercept compared to 
laser photocoagulation in subjects with ROP. The study consisted of a screening phase 
followed by a baseline visit when subjects were randomized either to aflibercept or laser 
(ratio: 2:1), followed by a 23-week treatment period, which equals a 24-week total study 
duration. 
Male and female treatment-naïve, preterm (gestational age at birth ≤ 32 weeks) or very low 
birthweight preterm infants (≤ 1,500 g) who weighed at least 800 g at baseline, with ROP 
classified in at least one eye as Zone I stage 1 plus, 2 plus, 3 non-plus or plus, or Zone II 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIII: Clinical Trial Exposure 
stage 2 plus or 3 plus, or aggressive posterior ROP (AP-ROP) according to the International 
Classification for ROP (ICROP) were enrolled. 
One or both eyes were treated based on the study eligibility criteria as assessed by the 
investigator. Subjects were also allowed to be retreated or administered rescue treatment 
(laser for the aflibercept arm; aflibercept for the laser arm) if protocol-specified criteria were 
met during the treatment period. Patients receiving rescue treatment were counted as non-
responders and were considered as missing for the primary endpoint but were to be followed 
to assess the efficacy and safety outcomes after rescue treatment. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and 
unfavourable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment based on 
investigator’s assessment. 
Key secondary efficacy endpoints addressing the primary objective were subjects with 
requirement for intervention with a second treatment from baseline to Week 24 and subjects 
with recurrence of ROP from baseline to Week 24, which were also analysed using a similar 
Bayesian statistical model as for the primary endpoint. 
In this study, a total of 113 subjects, 75 in the aflibercept treatment arm and 38 in the laser 
treatment arm were treated.  
FIREFLEYE NEXT (SN 20275) is a Phase IIIb extension study which follows up on ocular, 
neurodevelopmental and overall clinical outcomes until 5 years of age (when detailed 
assessment of visual function and overall development becomes feasible and table). No study 
treatment is administered. In case treatment is required, subjects will be able to receive any 
treatment modality according to the local standard of care. Of the 113 patients treated in 
FIREFLEYE, 100 patients have transitioned to FIREFLEYE NEXT, 3 patients died during 
FIREFLEYE and for 10 patients participation was declined.  
In this RMP version, the final study data up to week 24 of FIREFLEYE are included. A total 
of 4 patients randomized to the laser arm additionally received rescue treatment with Eylea, 
thus a total of 79 patients were exposed to Eylea in the FIREFLEYE study. Safety results 
from the FIREFLEYE NEXT extension study are reported separately (i.e., all subjects who 
entered the extension study as of 29 MAR 2021 were included in this interim analysis; n=90 
in total with n=29 patients previously treated with laser and n=61 treated previously with 
aflibercept in the pivotal FIREFLEYE study).  
SIII.2.2  Tabulated overview of exposure across of all studies 
Considering the 6,487 subjects who had received at least one dose of Eylea in all wet AMD 
(2 mg and 8 mg doses), CRVO, BRVO, myopic CNV, DME (2 mg and 8 mg doses), and 
ROP studies, the clinical trial exposure was as displayed in Table SIII.1.

The final patient exposure per treatment duration as well as the total exposure in months is 
shown for the myopic CNV indication (MYRROR) through Week 48 in Table SIII.5. A total 
of 25 patients in the sham group received at least one active Eylea injection from Week 24 
onwards; the exposure, however, was less extensive than in the Eylea 2 mg group, since the 
potential treatment duration was shorter. Overall, a total of 116 patients were exposed to 
Eylea in the MYRROR study through Week 48 and the cumulative exposure duration was 
1,079 patient months.

SIII.2.5.1  Indication: Wet AMD 
Table SIII.16 presents the allocation to treatment groups of all subjects who were included in 
the Phase I-IV AMD trials, separated by sex, age category, and race. 
Generally, there were slightly more female than male subjects treated with Eylea (53.4% vs. 
46.6%). As there were more studies performed in the EU and in the USA than in other 
countries, the majority of subjects in all dose groups receiving Eylea injection were White 
(71.3%), followed by Asians (26.3%). The majority of subjects receiving Eylea injections 
were ≥75 years of age in all dose groups (56.0%), followed by the age group ≥65 to <75 years 
of age (30.5%). 
Overall, the subgroup analyses did not point to a specific risk on treatment with Eylea in any 
of the analysed subgroups.

SIII.2.5.2  Indication: CRVO 
Table SIII.18 presents the subjects who were treated with Eylea in the 2 Phase III CRVO 
trials, separated by sex, age category, and race. 
Slightly more men than women were included in the Eylea total group (56.5% vs. 43.5%). As 
seen in the wet AMD studies, the majority of subjects treated with Eylea were White (76.0%). 
In contrast to the more age-related condition of wet AMD, the CRVO subjects treated with 
Eylea were obviously younger than wet AMD subjects: Almost half of the subjects in the 
Eylea total group (45.7%) were younger than 65 years (wet AMD: 10.4%), whilst 21.5% were 
at the age of 75 years or older (wet AMD: 63.6%).  
Again, no specific risk regarding Eylea injection was identified for CRVO subjects in any of 
the analysed subgroup.

An additional analysis was run to determine the age distribution among the 156 women who 
participated in the 2 CRVO studies (additionally including 204 males [mean age: 63.6 ± 14.7 
years], 360 study subjects in total). Applying a threshold age of <55 years, a total of 23 
women (14.7% of the 156 enrolled women) seemed to have been of childbearing potential in 
the CRVO studies (see Table SIII.20).

Table SIII.21 presents the 158 subjects who were treated with Eylea in the Phase III BRVO 
study VIBRANT separated by sex, age category, and race. 
The proportions of men and women treated with Eylea were similar, 44.9% of patients were 
younger than 65 years, and 73.4% were White. Generally, the BRVO patient characteristics 
were similar to those observed in the CRVO population. 
No specific risk regarding Eylea injection was identified for BRVO subjects in any of the 
analysed subgroup.

Table SIII.23 shows the MYRROR study patients separated by sex, age category, and race. 
All enrolled patients in this study were Asians, and clearly more females than males were 
treated in the Eylea total group (75.0% vs. 25.0%). In this indication - and in contrast to wet 
AMD or CRVO, where less than half of the patients were <65 years of age -, the majority of 
patients were younger than 65 years (65.5%), while only 9.5% were 75 years or older in the 
Eylea total group. 
No specific risks associated with Eylea were identified in any of the analyzed subgroups 
through study end at Week 48.

Also, in the myopic CNV population the proportion of females of childbearing potential was 
evaluated (see Table SIII.25). Given the same age threshold as used for the CRVO population

to assume a childbearing potential (i.e., <55 years), a total of 30 women (32.6%) of the 92 
females enrolled in MYRROR were of childbearing potential in the myopic CNV study. This 
proportion was about twice as high as in the CRVO studies.

summarized in Table SIII.27 (please note that the treatment groups reflect the originally 
randomized treatment arm). Based on the previously mentioned threshold of <55 years, a total 
of 44/364 women (12.1%) were of childbearing potential in these 2 studies. This figure was 
similar to that observed among the females with CRVO.

SIII.2.6  Exposure in special populations 
Data on special populations are shown for the 2 Phase III wet AMD studies (VIEW 1 and 2), 
the 2 Phase III CRVO studies (GALILEO and COPERNICUS), the Phase III BRVO study 
(VIBRANT), the Phase III myopic CNV study (MYRROR), the pivotal Phase III 
DME studies VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME, the Phase III ROP study (FIREFLEYE), the 
Phase II/III 8 mg wet AMD studies (CANDELA and PULSAR) and the Phase II/III 8 mg 
DME study (PHOTON). This subsection presents the number of subjects by dose group 
(treatment group) and special population subgroup in order to provide an overview of the 
distribution of the exposed study subjects among the pre-defined subgroups. 
Generally, 6 special population subgroups were identified by medical history, i.e., diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease (e.g., CVA/stroke), ischemic heart disease 
(e.g., myocardial infarction), history of renal impairment, and history of hepatic impairment. 
The percentages are related to the number of patients who received the respective dose of 
Eylea in the respective Phase III studies. 
SIII.2.6.1  Indication: Wet AMD 
As regards the wet AMD indication, a total of 1,824 patients with exposure to Eylea 
constituted the 96 weeks-safety population in the 2 pivotal Phase III studies in wet AMD 
(VIEW 1 and VIEW 2). Table SIII.33 shows the number of patients with a medical history of 
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease (e.g., CVA/stroke), ischemic heart 
disease (e.g., myocardial infarction), hepatic and renal impairment by dose group. There were 
no significant safety issues revealed during exposure of special populations to Eylea injection 
in the wet AMD Phase III studies.

Sub/intraretinal haemorrhage 
is caused primarily by wet 
AMD. It should therefore not 
be regarded as missing 
information in the clinical 
setting. Contrarily, patients 
with subretinal haemorrhage 
are probably those with a

According to SmPC: "Wet 
AMD is characterized by 
pathological choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV). 
Leakage of blood and fluid 
from CNV may cause retinal 
thickening or oedema and/or 
sub-/intra-retinal 
haemorrhage, resulting in 
loss of visual acuity". 
No concern referring to any 
specific safety aspect was 
detected.

predominately observed in the 
systemic circulation as an inactive 
stable complex with VEGF.  
As with other large proteins, both free 
and bound aflibercept are expected to 
be cleared by proteolytic catabolism. 
It is estimated that after intravitreal 
administration of 2 mg to patients, the 
mean maximum plasma concentration 
of free aflibercept is more than a 
100-fold lower than the concentration 
of aflibercept required to half-
maximally bind systemic VEGF

It is estimated that after 
intravitreal administration of 
8 mg to patients, the mean maxi-
mum plasma concentration of 
free aflibercept is more than a 
9-fold lower than the con-
centration of aflibercept re-quired 
to half-maximally bind systemic 
VEGF (2.91 µg/mL) in a study of 
healthy volunteers. 
Adverse events due to cumulative 
effects are not anticipated. 
Aflibercept is slowly absorbed 
from the eye into the systemic 
circulation after intravitreal 
administration and is 
predominately observed in the 
systemic circulation as an inactive 
stable complex with VEGF.  
Aflibercept is expected to undergo 
elimination through both target-
mediated disposition via binding to 
free endogenous VEGF and 
metabolism via proteolysis. The 
median time to reach non-
quantifiable concentrations of free 
aflibercept in plasma for 8 mg 
administered intravitreally was 
3.5 weeks.  
SIV.3  Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically under-represented in 
Clinical Trial Development Programs 
SIV.3.1  Children 
The safety and efficacy of Eylea in children and adolescents below 18 years of age for 
indications other than ROP have not been studied (0.4 mg Eylea was investigated in the 
indication ROP). There is no relevant use of Eylea in the paediatric population for the 
indications of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, DME and myopic CNV. 
SIV.3.2  Elderly 
2 mg Aflibercept Development Program: 
In the wet AMD studies VIEW 1 and VIEW2, more than half of the patients exposed to Eylea 
(57.7%) were ≥75 years old and 27.3% were aged between 65 and 74 years. Therefore, there 
is a high percentage of elderly in the clinical study program. 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIV: Populations not studied in Clinical Trials 
More than half of the patients enrolled in both Phase III CRVO studies were ≥65 years 
(54.3%). 45.7% of the CRVO patients were below 65 years of age. Mean age of patients at 
enrolment was 64.0 years, with individual patients’ ages ranging from 22 to 89 years. 
In the Phase III BRVO study VIBRANT, 44.9% of the 158 Eylea-exposed patients were 
younger than 65 years, 33.5% were aged between 65 to 74 years, and 21.5% were aged 
75 years or older. 
In the myopic CNV study, 65.5% of the 116 subjects exposed to Eylea (SAF) were at the age 
of <65 years, 25.0% were aged between 65 and 74 years, and 9.5% were ≥75 years. 
In the Phase I-III DME studies, 32.7% of the 1,372 subjects exposed to Eylea were at the age 
of ≥65 to <75 years, and 7.7% were ≥75 years. Due to the relatively small number of 
DME patients aged 75 years or older, a statement was included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) that there is limited experience in patients older than 75 years with 
DME. 
The distribution of the age groups is summarized by indication (excluding ROP) and in total 
in Table SIV.3. Overall, approximately one-third each of all exposed patients (N=4,635) 
belonged to one of the 3 age groups <65 years (32.4% of patients), ≥65 to <75 years (29.9%), 
and ≥75 years (37.6%).

SIV.3.3  Pregnant or breast-feeding women 
Pregnancy and lactation constituted exclusion criteria in all clinical trials. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 
So far, 8 cases of pregnancy were reported from 2 mg aflibercept clinical studies (direct 
exposure or exposure through male partner; see Part II Module SVII, Section SVII.3.1.14 and 
12 cases of pregnancy in female patients treated in the post-marketing setting until 
15 SEP 2017 (Part II Module SVII, Section SVII.3.1.14). These few cases did not suggest that 
treatment with Eylea might be associated with relevant embryo-fetotoxic effects. 
To date, no pregnancy occurred in the 8 mg aflibercept development program. 
SIV.3.4  Patients with a medical history of hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been performed in patients with hepatic disorders. 
Patients with hepatic disorders were not excluded in the clinical study program. 
After intravitreal administration of a maximum of 2 mg per dose, plasma concentrations of 
free aflibercept are negligibly low compared with those after subcutaneous and intravenous 
administration. Concentrations of bound aflibercept were also very low. In addition, the active 
moiety in aflibercept is a large protein. The metabolism and excretion of such molecules is 
generally by means other than the renal or hepatic pathways. It was therefore not considered 
necessary to conduct special clinical studies in patients with hepatic impairment. 
No PK analyses were performed in VIEW 1, and no specific PK analysis in patients with a 
medical history of hepatic impairment was performed in the wet AMD study VIEW 2. 
In SIGHT (SN 311523), there were only 4 subjects with a medical history of hepatic 
impairment compared with 195 subjects with no hepatic impairment, with mean values for 
free (adjusted bound) VTE of 22.85 (160.25) and 10.69 (147.79) μg/L, respectively. The 
difference in free VTE was attributed to high variability and the small number of subjects in 
the hepatic impairment group. Overall, the data did not provide any indication for a clinically 
relevant difference in free or adjusted bound VTE concentrations detected in subjects with 
different hepatic impairment status. 
 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SIV: Populations not studied in Clinical Trials 
In the ALTAIR study (SN 17668), 17 subjects had a medical history of hepatic impairment 
compared to 237 subjects with no hepatic impairment. No pharmacokinetic analyses were 
performed in the frame of this study. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the GALILEO study (study 14130, Bayer AG study) 
at Week 12, revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of active drug after 
intravitreal administration every 4 weeks. It must be considered that the sub-group of subjects 
with a medical history of hepatic impairment included only one to two subjects across all 
weeks. No pharmacokinetic analyses were done in the COPERNICUS study (study run by 
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIBRANT study (study VGFTe-RVO-1027-
BA01V1, study run by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) revealed no differences with respect 
to plasma concentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 weeks 
through Week 24 (no PK sampling time points were planned after Week 24). It must be 
considered that the sub-group of subjects with a medical history of hepatic impairment 
included only one subject. 
Similarly, pharmacokinetic analyses of patients in the myopic CNV study (MYRROR) up to 
Week 24 showed that the systemic exposure to free and bound VEGF Trap was low. The 
exploratory sub-group analyses did not reveal any relevant influence of hepatic function on 
the plasma concentration of adjusted bound VEGF Trap. However, it must be considered that 
the subgroup of patients with a medical history of hepatic impairment included only 7 patients 
at Week 12 (compared to 53 without medical history of hepatic impairment) and 5 patients at 
Week 24 (compared to 27 without a medical history of hepatic impairment). For free VEGF 
Trap, the concentrations measured for the subgroup analyses were below the limit of 
quantification, therefore definitive conclusions regarding the effect of the covariate factors on 
systemic exposures to free VEGF Trap could not be drawn. The final analyses at Week 48 did 
not result in new or unexpected findings compared to Week 24. 
In the VIVID-DME study (SN 91745, Bayer AG study), analysis of patients with a medical 
history of hepatic impairment at Week 0, Day 2-4, Week 24, and Week 52 revealed no 
influence of a medical history of hepatic impairment on plasma concentrations of free VEGF 
Trap. For adjusted bound VEGF Trap, a medical history of hepatic impairment showed a 
slight trend towards lower plasma concentrations with increasing level of impairment. 
However, the number of patients with liver dysfunction was very low (n=7) compared to 
patients without (n=118). In addition, plasma concentration ranges overlapped considerably. 
Therefore, these differences were not considered to be clinically relevant. No PK analyses 
were performed after the first year of the study. 
No pharmacokinetic analysis was done in the VISTA-DME study (study run by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or in the VIVID-EAST study (study run by Bayer AG). In the Phase III 
open-label DME study VIVID-JAPAN, exploratory subgroup analyses revealed no clinically 
relevant effects on free and bound VEGF Trap plasma concentrations with respect to medical 
history of hepatic impairment. 
No specific PK analysis in patients with a medical history of hepatic impairment was 
performed in the ROP study FIREFLEYE. 
No special studies in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment have been 
conducted with aflibercept 8 mg. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that mild 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept)

Part II – Module SIV: Populations not studied in Clinical Trials 
hepatic impairment had no influence on systemic exposures to aflibercept compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function.  
SIV.3.5  Patients with renal impairment 
No specific studies have been performed in patients with renal disorders. Patients enrolled in 
the clinical studies were classified according to their baseline creatinine clearance values in 
one of the 4 groups: 
•  Creatinine clearance >80 mL/min (normal renal function), 
•  Creatinine clearance >50-80 mL/min (mild renal impairment), 
•  Creatinine clearance >30-50 mL/min (moderate renal impairment), 
•  Creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min or requiring dialysis (severe renal impairment). 
No PK analyses were performed in VIEW 1. Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the 
VIEW 2 study, of which 40% had a medical history of renal impairment (24% mild, 15% 
moderate, and 1% severe), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of 
active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks. After intravitreal 
administration of a maximum of 2 mg per dose, plasma concentrations of free aflibercept 
were negligibly low compared with those after subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
Concentrations of bound aflibercept were also very low. In addition, the active moiety in 
aflibercept is a large protein. The metabolism and excretion of such molecules is generally by 
means other than the renal or hepatic pathways. It was therefore not considered necessary to 
conduct special clinical studies in patients with renal disorders. 
In SIGHT (SN 311523), the number of subjects in each creatinine clearance subgroup 
decreased from normal and mild renal impairment groups (89 subjects in the >80 mL/min 
group and 93 subjects in the >50-80 mL/min group) to moderate and severe renal impairment 
groups (12 subjects in the >30-50 mL/min group, and 1 subject in the ≤30 mL/min group). 
There was no quantifiable free VTE concentration in the one severe renal impairment subject. 
Overall, there was no difference in free or adjusted bound VTE concentrations detected in 
subjects with different renal function. 
No PK analyses were performed in the ALTAIR study (SN 17668). 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the GALILEO study (study 14130, Bayer AG study) 
at Week 12, of which 43% had a medical history of renal impairment (39% mild and 4% 
moderate), revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of active drug after 
intravitreal administration every 4 weeks. No pharmacokinetic analyses were done in the 
COPERNICUS study (study run by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in the VIBRANT study (study VGFTe-RVO-1027-
BA01V1, study run by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) revealed no differences with respect 
to plasma concentrations of active drug after intravitreal administration every 4 weeks 
through Week 24 (no PK sampling time points were planned after Week 24). It must be 
considered that the sub-group of subjects with a medical history of renal impairment included 
3 subjects with moderate (>30-50mL/min) and 11 subjects with mild (>50-80 mL/min) renal 
impairment. 
In the Phase III myopic CNV MYRROR study, 63% of patients treated with VEGF Trap had 
a medical history of renal impairment (52% mild and 11% moderate; solely defined through

baseline creatinine clearance values of >50-80 mL/min and >30-50 mL/min, respectively). 
Pharmacokinetic analyses of patients in MYRROR up to Week 48 revealed no specific 
influence of medical history of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bound VEGF 
Trap. 
In the VIVID-DME study (SN: 91745, Bayer AG study), analysis of patients with a medical 
history of renal impairment at Week 0, Day 2-4, Week 24, and Week 52 revealed no influence 
of renal impairment on plasma concentrations of free VEGF Trap. For (the pharmacologically 
inactive) adjusted bound VEGF Trap, a slight trend towards higher plasma concentrations 
with increasing level of impairment was shown. However, the number of patients with renal 
dysfunction decreased from more than 60 (>80 mL/min creatinine clearance) to 1 
(<30 mL/min creatinine clearance). In addition, plasma concentration ranges overlapped 
considerably. Therefore, these differences were not considered to be clinically relevant. No 
further PK samples were taken after the first year of the study. 
No pharmacokinetic analysis was done in the VISTA study (study run by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) or in the VIVID-EAST study (study run by Bayer AG). 
In the Phase III open-label DME study VIVID-JAPAN, renal function was assessed by 
calculated CLCR and divided into 4 subgroups. The mean of free VEGF Trap concentrations 
slightly increased with decreasing CLCR. However, taking into account the absolute values, 
large variability, and very low number of patients in the lowest CLCR (≤30 mL/min) group, 
these differences appeared to be small and clinically not relevant. For the pharmacologically 
inactive adjusted bound VEGF Trap, there was no clear trend seen in plasma concentrations 
across the different CLCR groups. Subjects in the >80 mL/min CLCR group had a lower mean 
compared to subjects with CLCR values ≤80 mL/min. However, the ranges of all CRCL groups 
overlapped considerably and in 3 out of the 4 groups the maximum concentrations of adjusted 
bound VEGF Trap did no exceed the LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) by more than 
4.5-fold (except CLCR >50-80 mL/min group where it exceeded the LLOQ by 19-fold). 
No specific PK analysis in patients with a medical history of renal impairment was performed 
in the ROP study FIREFLEYE. 
No specific studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with 8mg 
aflibercept. Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that systemic exposures to 
aflibercept in patients with mild to severe renal impairment were similar to those with normal 
renal function.

The VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 studies (Phase III wet AMD trials) were conducted in a total of 
28 countries including North and South America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Study populations 
included Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, and Black patients. The Phase III AMD study SIGHT 
was performed among 304 Chinese patients. 
The Phase III CRVO trial COPERNICUS was conducted at 61 sites in the USA, Canada, 
Colombia, Israel and India. The GALILEO study was conducted at 63 sites in Europe and the 
Asia Pacific region. 
The Phase III BRVO study VIBRANT was conducted at 58 sites in the USA, Canada, and 
Japan. 
Only Asian patients were randomized and treated in the Phase III myopic CNV study 
MYRROR (90 patients in Japan and 32 patients in other Asian countries [Taiwan, South 
Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore]). 
The Phase III DME study VISTA-DME was performed in the USA, while the Phase III DME 
study VIVID-DME was conducted in various European countries, Japan, and Australia. Only 
Japanese patients were included in the open-label Phase III DME study VIVID-JAPAN 
(72 patients in the SAF). In the Phase III DME study VIVID-EAST, most of the patients were 
enrolled in China (approximately 80%), while the remaining patients were enrolled in Russia 
and other Asia-Pacific countries. 
The Phase III ROP study FIREFLEYE was conducted in a total of 27 countries including 
Europe, Asia Pacific, and South America.  
Overall, patients of various different racial and/or ethnic origins were exposed to Eylea 
40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) in the development programs; the majority of exposed patients, 
however, were White (66.0%; see Table SIV.5).

SIV.3.10  Conclusion on the populations not-studied and other limitations of the 
clinical trial development program 
As Eylea belongs to the class of anti-VEGF therapies, which are potentially teratogenic, 
embryo-fetotoxicity has been identified as an important potential risk. No additional safety 
concerns were identified in this section.

SV.1 
Post-authorisation Exposure 
SV.1.1  Method used to Calculate Exposure 
The patient exposure displayed in this RMP (expressed as patient years [PYs]) was estimated 
based on the number of sold/distributed Eylea vials/PFS during the reporting period and the 
presumed underlying prevalence and treatment schedules of the approved Eylea indications 
wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO and DME. The following assumptions were made: 
•  wet AMD: 52% of Eylea-treated patients will have AMD and receive 7 vials/PFS per 
year, 
•  CRVO: 6% of Eylea-treated patients will have CRVO and receive 6 vials/PFS per 
year, 
•  DME: 26% of Eylea-treated patients will have DME and receive 8 vials/PFS per year, 
•  BRVO: 13% of Eylea-treated patients will have BRVO and receive 6 vials/PFS per 
year, 
•  Myopic CNV: 3% of Eylea-treated patients will have myopic CNV and receive 1 
vial/PFS per year. 
The resulting formula for the calculation of total PYs is: 
Total no. of vials  and PFS / ((0.52 x 7) + (0.06 x 6) + (0.26 x 8) + (0.13 x 6) + (0.03 x 1)) 
= Total no. of vials and PFS / 6.89 
and the PYs per indication were calculated as 52%, 6%, 26%, 13%, and 3% from the total 
PYs for wet AMD, CRVO, DME, BRVO, and myopic CNV, respectively. 
This mode of calculation for PYs is considered rather conservative, because patients treated 
under usual care conditions might receive fewer injections than required per label, meaning 
that the true number of patient years (i.e., number of treated patients) could be even higher 
than calculated (which would further decrease the estimated incidence rates of post-marketing 
safety events related to PYs). 
SV.1.2  Exposure 
A total of 59,495,014 units (vial/PFS) were sold world-wide by 31 OCT 2022, resulting in an 
estimated overall exposure of 8,634,980 patient years across all 5 indications based on the 
aforementioned formula.

SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
Introductory note: Please note that the contents of the previous Eylea EU-RMP 
(Version 24.0) have been transferred into the new EU-RMP template. Therefore, this section 
does not describe the situation at the time of the initial approval of 2 mg Eylea, as this 
information is outdated (initial EU approval was on 22 NOV 2012). Instead, both the 
definitions of safety concerns and the adverse drug reaction table valid at the time of the first 
drug renewal procedure (EMEA/H/C/002392//R/0033) have been used for the current 
presentation of safety concerns according to the new template. This section will now be 
locked after RMP approval and any future changes presented in Section SVII.2. 
This section SVII.1 reflects the ADR frequencies as observed during the development of 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose). The conclusion on “Risks not considered important for 
Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP” (below SVII.1.), “Risks considered 
important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP” (SVII.1.2), are also 
applicable to Eylea 114.3 mg/mL, 8 mg dose. Relevant changes to the risk profile derived 
from the 8 mg aflibercept program are addressed in section SVII.2 “New Safety Concerns and 
Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated RMP”. 
SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for Inclusion in the List of Safety 
Concerns in the RMP 
Adverse drug reactions seen in Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose development) phase III 
studies 
The following treatment-emergent drug reactions (reported in patients in Eylea Phase III 
studies) are included in the current SmPC (version JUL 2017, MedDRA preferred term level): 
Very common: Visual acuity reduced, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye pain. 
Common: Retinal pigment epithelial tear, detachment of retinal pigment epithelium, retinal 
degeneration, vitreous haemorrhage, cataract, cataract cortical, cataract nuclear, cataract 
subcapsular, corneal erosion, corneal abrasion, intraocular pressure increased, vision blurred, 
vitreous floaters, vitreous detachment, injection site pain, foreign body sensation in eyes, 
lacrimation increased, eyelid oedema, injection site haemorrhage, punctate keratitis, 
conjunctival hyperaemia, ocular hyperaemia. 
Uncommon: Hypersensitivity, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, retinal tear, iritis, uveitis, 
iridocyclitis, lenticular opacities, corneal epithelium defect, injection site irritation, abnormal 
sensation in eye, eyelid irritation, anterior chamber flare, corneal oedema. 
Rare: Blindness, cataract traumatic, vitritis, hypopyon. 
The conditions, which are regarded as important identified or potential risks (either as single 
preferred term event term or by term grouping) are underlined in the preceding listing. The 
remaining risks are not regarded as important for the following reasons A to C: 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
A) Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated): 
•  Visual acuity reduced (very common), vision blurred (common). 
Comment: This functional loss is mainly considered to occur as a result of the 
underlying ocular disease. It may represent a symptom of an injection related event 
such as intraocular inflammation/infection or retinal tear/detachment. These 
complications pose important identified risk in the EU RMP. 
•  Conjunctival haemorrhage (very common), conjunctival hyperaemia (common), 
ocular hyperaemia (common), vitreous haemorrhage (common), vitreous floaters 
(common), eye pain (very common), injection site pain (common), injection site 
haemorrhage (common), injection site irritation (uncommon), lacrimation increased 
(common), foreign body sensation in eyes (common), abnormal sensation in eye 
(uncommon), eyelid irritation (uncommon). 
Comment: These are local events likely caused by the intraocular injection procedure, 
which are usually mild and fully reversible in nature. It is expected that Health Care 
Professionals (HCPs) are well familiar with these concomitant adverse effects of the 
IVT injection. 
B) Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile (in relation to the severity of 
the indication treated): 
•  Detachment of retinal pigment epithelium (common), retinal degeneration (common), 
vitreous detachment (common), corneal erosion (common), corneal abrasion 
(common), punctate keratitis (common), corneal epithelium defect (uncommon). 
Comment: These events are likely procedure-related (however, “detachment of retinal 
pigment epithelium” and “retinal degeneration” could also be promoted by underlying 
disease) and may result in longer-term complaints. However, no severe sequelae are 
expected, and these events are not assumed to impair the positive risk/benefit profile 
of Eylea. It is expected that HCPs are well familiar with these potential adverse effects 
of the IVT injection. 
C) Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low 
frequency and considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated: 
•  Blindness (rare). 
Comment: This event is rare and may also occur as a result of the underlying disease. 
Reasons for considering other risks not important (incl. class effects) 
Potential risk: Sustained intraocular pressure. 
Issue: A persistent ocular hypertension (OHT) has been observed after intravitreal injection of 
VEGF inhibitors (ranibizumab, bevacizumab) (170, 190-192), leading to an assumed class 
effect of “sustained” IOP increase. The incidence of sustained OHT after intraocular 
administration of these VEGF inhibitors ranged between 3.1% and 11.9% in studies with 96 - 
512 treated eyes (170, 190). Two hypotheses have been described for the underlying 
mechanism of chronic OHT: 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
1)  The  anti-VEGF  antibodies  (=  high  molecular  proteins)  may  accumulate  in  the  aqueous 
outflow  channels  including  the  trabecular  meshwork  or  Schlemm´s  canal  and  obstruct 
aqueous outflow (193). 
2) Immunological reactions and low-grade inflammation post-injection may be an additional 
mechanism leading to IOP elevations (170, 194). 
Both effects may be amplified by the quality of the injected VEGF inhibitor: aggregation of 
the antibody to higher molecular structures may enhance the obstruction of the outflow 
system. Also, contaminants such as silicone oil from the syringe barrel or rubber stopper may 
block the outflow system or induce subclinical inflammation (191, 195, 196). 
Comment: A transient increase of IOP, which is often observed after intravitreal injection of 
fluids, is considered an important identified risk of IVT Eylea administration. It is attributed 
to an increase in vitreous volume (volume effect), which is compensated within 0.5 to 1 hours 
after injection, so that IOP normalizes back to baseline values (195, 197). Therefore, the 
volume effect is not responsible for a chronic elevation of IOP. Thorough monitoring of mean 
values over time for pre-injection IOP in the clinical Phase III Eylea trials indicated the there 
is no trend towards sustained IOP increase on treatment with Eylea. Therefore, the assumed 
class effect of "sustained" IOP increase is not regarded as an important risk of treatment with 
Eylea. 
SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
An overview of the important identified risks of Eylea is provided in Table SVII.1. 
Table SVII.1: Overview of important identified risks 
Important identified risk 
Risk-benefit impact 
Endophthalmitis (likely infectious origin) 
Endophthalmitis is an intraocular infection and may occur as a 
result of an infection with microorganisms, either through 
direct traumatic injury of the eye (exogenous infection) or 
through spreading of microorganisms from other areas of the 
body (endogenous infection). In cases of inflammation where 
no pathogens can be identified (no/negative culture growth of 
microorganisms observed), the condition may be characterized 
as "sterile endophthalmitis" or "non-infectious 
endophthalmitis". 
Because of the risk of severe vision loss, treatment should be 
initiated as soon as possible, and, depending on cause and 
severity, may consist of topical and intravitreal application of 
antibiotics, corticosteroids, and surgical removal of matter and 
infected structures (drainage, vitrectomy). 
The risk of endophthalmitis (and other intraocular infections) 
cannot be completely excluded but minimized through strict 
aseptic and sterile conditions when administering Eylea. Only 
experienced and appropriately trained ophthalmologists should 
be charged with the injections, and patients should report any 
signs or symptoms of intraocular inflammation (e.g., visual 
acuity decreased, pain, photophobia, or redness) as soon as 
possible in order to enable the treating physician to introduce 
appropriate countermeasures in due time. Educational material

Intraocular inflammation 
Transient intraocular pressure increase 
is provided i.a., to promote optimal administration technique. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced endophthalmitis in the study eye in the clinical 
studies with Eylea was low (range from 0% to 0.9% in the 
VIEW 1 extension study); endophthalmitis is regarded as an 
uncommon ADR. Endophthalmitis cases (and other cases of 
intraocular inflammation) reported in post-marketing setting 
are subject to additional follow-up using specific 
questionnaires. Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of 
endophthalmitis is considered favourable for Eylea. 
Intraocular inflammations (other than endophthalmitis) are 
inflammations of defined structures of the inner eye (e.g., 
iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis). Aside from 
endophthalmitis/intraocular inflammations with an infectious 
origin, there are also inflammations where no pathogens can be 
identified (either no culture performed or negative culture 
growth), the condition may be characterized as "sterile" 
inflammatory condition. 
The cause of a sterile inflammation, independently of the 
administered drug, remains uncertain, and a multifactorial 
origin cannot be discarded. An intraocular inflammation 
generally constitutes a serious condition, which may lead to 
generalized eye inflammation and risk of blindness. Treatment 
should be initialized as soon as possible, and, depending on 
cause and severity, may consist of topical and intravitreal 
application of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and surgical removal 
of matter and infected structures (drainage, vitrectomy). 
The risk of intraocular infections can be minimized through 
strict aseptic and sterile conditions when administering Eylea 
(see endophthalmitis). 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced intraocular inflammation (grouped term) in the 
study eye in the clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 0% to 
2.6% (VIEW 1 & 2 AMD studies). Single preferred terms 
events associated with intraocular inflammation are considered 
uncommon ADRs (e.g., iritis, uveitis, iridocyclitis) or rate 
ADRs (vitritis, hypopyon). Endophthalmitis and other cases of 
intraocular inflammation reported in post-marketing setting are 
subject to additional follow-up using specific questionnaires. 
Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of intraocular inflammation 
is considered favourable for Eylea. 
Chronically elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor 
for a condition called "glaucoma", which is characterized by a 
loss of nerve fibres in the optic nerve with the subsequent risk 
of blindness. However, many different factors may be 
responsible for the development of glaucoma, and increased 
intraocular pressure is not a mandatory prerequisite for the 
development of glaucoma (e.g., normal-tension glaucoma). 
Transient IOP increase following IVT injection is a well-
known side effect of any IVT administration of liquids used 
for drug dissolution, but this condition is limited and usually

resolved once the surplus fluid has been resorbed from the 
inner eye. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced an increase in intraocular pressure (grouped term) 
in the study eye in the clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 
2.8% (VIVID-JAPAN DME study) to 13.6% (CRVO studies 
GALILEO & COPERNICUS), but the vast majority of these 
events were resolved. Systematic measurements of IOP during 
the course of the clinical studies did not indicate a trend 
towards sustained IOP increase. “Intraocular pressure 
increased” (single preferred term) is considered a common 
ADR. Transient intraocular pressure increase reported in post-
marketing setting are subject to additional follow-up using 
specific questionnaires. Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of 
transient IOP increase is considered favourable for Eylea. 
The retinal pigment epithelium is the outer layer of the retina, 
and tears in that layer may occur secondary to AMD, 
following intravitreal injections, or for unknown reasons. 
These tears may be self-sealing or may require sealing by laser 
coagulation. 
In clinical trials up to 1.9% of patients with underlying wet 
AMD who were treated with Eylea developed RPE tear, while 
none of the patients treated for other Eylea indications (CRVO, 
BRVO, myopic CNV, DME) had developed RPE tear. RPE 
tear is considered a common ADR. However, the total 
incidence of RPE tears with Eylea in the AMD Phase III trials 
was in line with the known background incidences from 
literature; and the absence of RPE tear in the clinical studies 
investigating the non-AMD indications of Eylea suggests that 
RPE tear development caused by IVT treatment with Eylea is 
rather unlikely. Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of RPE tear 
is considered favourable for Eylea. 
Retinal tear/detachment is characterized by separation of the 
retina from its attachment to the underlying tissues. Most 
retinal detachments are a result of a retinal break, hole, or tear. 
Retinal tear/detachment usually constitutes an 
ophthalmological emergency that requires medical 
intervention, including sealing and/or re-attachment of the 
retinal lesion through laser photocoagulation or freezing 
(cryotherapy). 
The risk can be reduced by performing a proper IVT injection 
technique IVT procedure using a correct angle of the needle 
while injecting. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced retinal tear/detachment in the study eye in the 
clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 0% to 1.5% (VIEW 1 
extension study). Retinal tear/detachment is considered an 
uncommon ADR. Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of retinal 
tear/detachment is considered favourable for Eylea.

Hypersensitivity and immunogenicity 
following outside influences such as irradiation or mechanical 
injury (traumatic cataract). 
Thus, the needle injury required to inject Eylea through the 
lens into the eyeball could cause such a traumatic cataract. 
However, by correct IVT procedure and a correct angle of the 
needle while injecting, the risk of cataract development can be 
minimized. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced traumatic cataract in the study eye in the clinical 
studies with Eylea ranged from 0% to 2.8% (VIVID-DME & 
VISTA-DME). Various forms of cataract (cortical, nuclear, 
subcapsular) are considered common ADRs; traumatic cataract 
is regarded as a rare ADR. 
There is currently no evidence that the occurrence of a 
traumatic cataract is increased on treatment with Eylea. 
However, as this might be a hypothetical result of the lens 
perforation, it has been included as important identified risk. 
Currently, the risk-benefit in terms of cataract development is 
considered favourable for Eylea. 
VEGF-Trap Eye is a foreign protein to the patient and, as such, 
may generate allergic reactions or may prompt the immune 
system to react by formation of specific antibodies, which in 
turn may cause immunologic reactions or attenuate the drug 
effects. Therefore, both hypersensitivity and immunogenicity 
are considered important identified risks of treatment with 
Eylea. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Eylea or to any 
of its excipients must not be treated with Eylea. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who 
experienced any potential hypersensitivity events in the 
clinical studies (grouped term) with Eylea ranged from 0% to 
5.2% (VIEW 1 & VIEW 2). Hypersensitivity is considered an 
uncommon ADR. 
Since Eylea is injected locally into the eye, the systemic 
exposure to Eylea is very small. Furthermore, immunogenicity 
to Eylea appears to be very low and there is no evidence that it 
impacts the safety or efficacy of Eylea. Currently, the risk-
benefit in terms of hypersensitivity / immunogenicity is 
considered favourable for Eylea. 
Table SVII.2 summarizes the identified potential risks of Eylea. This group mainly includes 
the class effects known from systematically administered VEGF inhibitors as well as off-label 
use and medication error.

Arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs), 
including non-MI ATEs and cardiovascular 
ischemic events 
Venous thromboembolic events 
Hypertension 
Intravenous injections of anti-VEGF agents at high doses used 
to treat cancer are known to be associated with an increased 
occurrence of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs). Since 
Eylea is administered in very small doses directly into the eye, 
the risk of developing such systemic adverse events is 
considered very low. However, since Eylea belongs to the class 
of anti-VEGF therapies, arterial thromboembolic events are 
considered an important potential risk. 
The targeted analysis of adjudicated ATE according to the 
definitions provided by the Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration 
(APTC) during the clinical development program is highly 
expressive, since the ATE terms are clearly defined and 
adjudicated by an independent data review committee. 
Consistently, the analyses in the AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic 
CNV, and DME studies did not show meaningful differences 
between Eylea and the respective parallel control groups. No 
dose-dependent trends could be observed in ATE incidences, 
and incidences were generally low. So far, there is no relevant 
indication that treatment with Eylea might be associated with an 
increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events. Systemic 
pharmacodynamic effects, including the development of ATEs, 
are deemed unlikely. ATE cases reported in post-marketing 
setting are subject to additional follow-up using specific 
questionnaires. 
Venous thromboembolic events have been associated with 
intravenous injection of anti-VEGF therapies at the doses used 
for cancer treatment. As with the remaining potential systemic 
class effect risks, the low incidence and the absence of dose 
dependency in the Phase III AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic 
CNV, and DME studies support that Eylea is unlikely to cause 
venous thromboembolic events. 
Arterial hypertension has been associated with intravenous 
injection of anti-VEGF therapies at the doses used for cancer 
treatment. So far, there is no evidence that the very small doses 
of Eylea that are injected into the eye are associated with an 
increased risk of hypertension. 
Following IVT administration of aflibercept at the doses 
studied, free aflibercept is not present at sufficient plasma 
concentrations (or for a sufficient length of time) to induce 
meaningful reductions in available systemic active endogenous 
free VEGF. Importantly, aflibercept did not accumulate in 
plasma after IVT administration every 4 weeks (VIEW 2). A 
contributory role of Eylea to an increase in blood pressure is 
considered unlikely. Hypertension cases reported in 
post-marketing setting are subject to additional follow-up using 
specific questionnaires.

Proteinuria 
Non-ocular haemorrhage 
Medication error 
Off-label use and misuse 
Embryo-fetotoxicity 
Proteinuria is associated with intravenous injection of anti-
VEGF therapies at the doses used for cancer treatment. The 
incidence of treatment-emergent proteinuria was low in patients 
treated with Eylea in the clinical development program and 
showed no dose dependency. There is no evidence that the very 
small doses of Eylea that are injected into the eye are associated 
with an increased risk of proteinuria. 
Non-ocular bleedings are associated with intravenous injection 
of anti-VEGF therapies at the doses used for cancer treatment. 
The similar event rates in the Eylea groups compared to the 
respective parallel groups (i.e., ranibizumab, sham, or laser) as 
well as the absence of any dose-response relationship among 
Eylea-treated patients in the Phase III AMD, CRVO, BRVO, 
myopic CNV, and DME studies suggest that Eylea is unlikely 
to cause non-ocular (systemic) haemorrhages. 
There is an excess volume in the marketed vial which exceeds 
the recommended net dose of 2 mg Eylea per injection. Thus, 
injection of more than the approved volume results in overdose. 
However, this numerical overdose is limited, and the drug will 
be administered only by qualified physicians (not by patients), 
and this reduces the risk of inappropriate dosing and 
administration as well. No clinically meaningful events of 
overdose have been reported so far (neither in clinical trials nor 
in usual care). Nevertheless, it was decided to consider 
"medication error " a potential risk of treatment, which is, 
however, completely avoidable by proper adherence to the 
dosing recommendations. 
As with other drugs, Eylea might be intentionally used other 
than recommended, or in clinical conditions outside the 
approved indications. Eylea does not have any dependence 
potential. Since the clinical experience with Eylea in such off-
label use is limited (in particular in terms of efficacy and 
safety), any case of off-label use is currently considered an 
important potential risk. 
In addition, intentional off-label use in the context of multiple 
use of single use product (vial splitting) has been observed with 
Eylea. The Eylea vial is approved for single eye use only. 
As angiogenesis is a critical component of embryonic and foetal 
development, inhibition of angiogenesis following systemic 
administration of anti-VEGF therapies might result in adverse 
effects on pregnancy. The current experience with 
IVT-administered anti-VEGF therapies in pregnancy is sparse 
(single cases reported only) and thus inconclusive. However, 
early loss of pregnancy after IVT bevacizumab injection has 
been reported in a very few instances (198). Therefore, 
particular attention is paid to that safety issue. No cases of 
embryo-fetotoxicity were reported during the clinical 
development program; however, pregnant females were 
excluded from clinical study participation. Current post-
marketing surveillance data do not suggest an increased risk of 
embryo-fetotoxicity on treatment with Eylea.

Retinal haemorrhage 
Many ocular diseases, including wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, or

treatment with anti-VEGF therapies, this condition is also 
considered an important potential risk.

Long-term safety beyond 2 years 
Posology utilized in marketed use 
Eylea has not been studied in patients with uncontrolled 
glaucoma, and it is possible that the additional volume load 
and secondary transient increase in intraocular pressure 
caused by the IVT injection might be especially detrimental in 
those patients with uncontrolled glaucoma. The currently 
available data do not allow a final judgment of this theoretical 
concern. No additional Pharmacovigilance (PV) activities are 
currently warranted. 
Under real-world conditions patients may be simultaneously 
treated with numerous drugs, which might result in 
interferences that have never been evaluated in clinical 
studies. Thus, there is a certain probability that Eylea will be 
administered in combination (or in close temporal sequence) 
with other anti-VEGF therapies or other treatments for wet 
AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic CNV, and DME. The potential 
interferences and consequences of such combinations cannot 
be assessed at the moment; no additional PV activities are 
currently warranted. 
The clinical studies, which provided the basis for the approval 
of Eylea, did not cover a treatment period of longer than 
2 years. However, since patients in the post-authorization 
phase are likely to be treated for longer than 2 years, it would 
be reasonable to systematically collect safety data beyond 2 
years in order to assess the long-term safety of Eylea more 
appropriately. Sufficiently comprehensive data on the long-
term safety of Eylea beyond the 2 years of administration is 
currently not available; no additional PV activities are 
currently warranted. 
Dose recommendations are provided by the marketing 
authorization holder in the package insert and other 
documents. However, physicians might choose a different 
dosage, based on their expert medical opinion. It is useful for 
the marketing authorization holder to receive information 
about these intentional deviations from the recommended 
dosage in order to be better aware of how the mediation is 
being used in practice. Currently, there is insufficient 
information about the posology actually being used by 
physicians in clinical practice. Two post-authorization 
efficacy studies (PAES) are currently being conducted in 
order to evaluate the effects of an “treat and extend” regimen

SVII.2  New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an 
Updated RMP 
Changes since last RMP: 
Overall, following the review of the 44/48-week data of the 8 mg studies CANDELA, 
PULSAR and PHOTON no new safety concerns were identified.  
Patients in the CANDELA and PHOTON studies were allowed to be treated with 2 mg 
aflibercept in the fellow eye. Patients in the wet AMD PULSAR study were allowed to be 
treated with 2 mg aflibercept or other anti-VEGFs in the non-study eye. The review of safety 
data in bilaterally treated patients with 8 mg in study and 2 mg in the fellow eye did not result 
in a new safety concern. 
As bilateral treatment with Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) per eye has not been studied 
during the pre-authorization phase “Exposure with bilateral 8 mg aflibercept therapy” was 
added as Missing Information to this EU RMP Version.  
The safety associated with 8 mg aflibercept bilateral administration will be monitored in the 
PSUR. 
Changes/decisions made in previous RMPs: 
Based on the cumulative review of the proteinuria cases and the use of Eylea as displayed in 
PSUR#7, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) Rapporteur concluded 
that “proteinuria” could be removed from the important potential risk list and the topic could 
be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
After a cumulative review of all cases received during the period covered by PSUR#9 (from 
01 DEC 2018 to 30 NOV 2019) (Procedure no.: EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010020/201911), the 
PRAC Rapporteur recommended to include the AE “retinal haemorrhage” in the SmPC 
Section 4.8 under “Eye disorder” and delete it as important identified risk. 
In Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/002392/II/0075 the PRAC recommended to shorten the list of 
safety concerns by removing some identified and potential risks not associated with additional 
risk minimisation measures such as retinal tear/detachment, hypersensitivity and

immunology, arterial thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolic events, hypertension 
and non-ocular haemorrhage. These safety concerns will continue to be addressed in 
subsequent PSURs. Furthermore, PRAC requested to have the following Missing Information 
topics removed from the EU RMP due to lack of additional Pharmacovigilance (PV) 
activities: Use of Eylea® in patients with uncontrolled glaucoma, Concomitant use of different 
anti-VEGF therapies and other therapies for wet AMD, CRVO and DME (including bilateral 
treatment with anti- VEGFs), Long term safety beyond 2 years.  
Following completion of studies VIOLET and AZURE removal of “Posology utilized in 
marketed use” as a missing information was requested in procedure No. EMEA-H-C-002392-
II-0076. 
One new safety concern was identified regarding missing information long-term safety of 
aflibercept in preterm infants with ROP.

Safety data per identified/potential risk derived from the Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) 
development program is shown pooled across the indications (wet AMD/DME (pool: 
44/48 weeks data for CANDELA/PULSAR/PHOTON). Pooling is considered meaningful 
based on similar study designs, same competitor, and an overall similar safety profile of wet 
AMD and DME. 
The presented figures represent crude incidences from the data, regardless of the 
investigator’s causality attribution. The study designs are outlined in the following sections. 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (0.5/2 mg doses) studies in wet AMD 
For AMD, pooled data (VIEW 1 [VGFT-OD-0605] and VIEW 2 [SN 91689] studies) from 
baseline through 96 weeks5 are primarily presented. In Year 1 of the studies, patients received 
fixed-dose treatment with ranibizumab 0.5 mg every 4 weeks (RQ4), VEGF Trap-Eye 0.5 mg 
every 4 weeks (0.5Q4), VEGF Trap-Eye 2 mg every 4 weeks (2Q4), and VEGF Trap-Eye 
2 mg every 8 weeks (2Q8). The original dose of Year 1 (i.e., 0.5 or 2.0 mg per injection) was 
maintained in Year 2 of the studies, but the treatment intervals could be extended to 12 weeks 
at maximum according to pre-specified re-treatment criteria (modified quarterly dosing). The 
safety data of the 1,824 SAF patients treated in VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 are presented by 
randomized treatment group at Baseline, i.e., RQ4 (N=595), VTE 0.5Q4 (N=601), VTE 2Q4 
(N=613), and VTE 2Q8 (N=610). 
VIEW 1 patients of any randomized treatment group who had completed the 96 weeks of the 
core study had the opportunity to start or continue treatment with Eylea 2 mg in the 
open-label, multi-dose VIEW 1 extension study (VGFT-OD-0910) conducted in order to 
assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Eylea. During the course of the study, patients 
were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 3 treatment groups which differed in the packaging or 
sterilization techniques of Eylea 2 mg (i.e., vials, or one of the externally sterilized prefilled 
syringes [ethylene oxide, ETO, or hydrogen peroxide, VHP]) in order to investigate the safety 
profile of the different product configurations and external sterilization techniques. Eylea 
2 mg was to be administered no more frequently than every 4 weeks and no less frequently 
than every 12 weeks (later on amended in the US to 8 weeks). A total of 323 VIEW 1 
completers were enrolled in VGFT-OD-0910, 320 received study drug treatment in the 
extension phase with Eylea in the study eye (69 from the original RQ4 group, 87 from the 
original 0.5Q4 group, and 92 and 72 from the original 2Q4 and 2Q8 groups, respectively), 
and 281 were randomized to the different product specifications (93 to vials, 94 to ETO, and 
94 to VHP). Three of the 323 subjects enrolled in the VIEW 1 extension study were last 
treated with Eylea 2 mg at Week 96 of the core VIEW 1 study (all 3 were randomized in the 
2Q4 group) but did not receive treatment in the extension phase. These patients were 
nevertheless included in the safety set of the VIEW 1 extension study, as they had received 
Eylea at Week 96 of the VIEW 1 core study and thus were exposed to Eylea. 
The mean treatment duration in VGFT-OD-0910 (excluding the core study period of 
96 weeks) for all enrolled extension study patients (N=323) was 110.4 weeks. The safety data 
presented in this module are based on the safety events occurring during the extension period 
5 Patients in VIEW 2 who received their last study injection on Week 92 were to be followed up to Week 100 
according to regulatory obligations. For the sake of straightforwardness, the duration of observation in both 
VIEW 1 and VIEW is designated as 96 weeks (although some patients in VIEW 2 were observed for up to 
100 weeks).

in the 323 patients (SAF) who were exposed to Eylea in the extension period (referred to as 
"Eylea total group"). Two additional analysis groups were defined, with 
i)  patients who had been treated with ranibizumab in the  preceding  core  study period 
(N=69;  designated  as  "ranibizumab  group"  in  the  tables  and  "former  ranibizumab 
group" in the running text), and 
ii) patients who had been treated with Eylea at any dose (i.e., 0.5Q4, 2Q4, or 2Q8) already 
during the core study period (N=254; designated as "Eylea combined group" in the 
tables and "former Eylea groups" in the running text). 
This separation was deemed reasonable, because only the 254 patients from the original Eylea 
groups were on true long-term treatment with Eylea (i.e., beyond 96 weeks of treatment, for 
up to approximately 5 years in total). In the 320 subjects who also received treatment in the 
study extension period, a total of 7,215 injections were administered in the study eye from the 
original baseline in VIEW 1 through the end of the extension period (range: 12 to 61 
injections), and the overall mean treatment duration was 48.9 ± 9.8 months (range: 23 to 64 
months). 
SIGHT (SN 13406) was a randomized, double-masked, photodynamic therapy-controlled 
Phase III study in order to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Eylea in Chinese 
subjects with wet AMD. A total of 304 patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to treatment 
with Eylea 2 mg (N=228) or control treatment with PDT (N=76). Primary efficacy 
assessments were performed at Week 28. Patients in the Eylea 2 mg group received the first 3 
IVT injections with Eylea every 4 weeks (i.e., at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 8) and 
subsequently every 8 weeks until Week 48 (i.e., at Weeks 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48). At Weeks 
28 and 36, sham injections were additionally required. Patients in the PDT control group 
received one PDT procedure at baseline and were allowed to undergo additional PDT 
procedures through Week 28 as indicated according to local clinical practice and the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. Sham injections were administered in order to maintain the blind 
(while patients in the Eylea group underwent a sham PDT procedure at baseline and 
additional sham PDT procedures as indicated according to local clinical practice and the 
clinical judgment of the investigator). At Week 28, after all variables for the primary efficacy 
endpoint had been assessed and the data recorded, subjects in the PDT group were to receive 
one injection with Eylea 2 mg and subsequent injections with Eylea 2 mg at Weeks 32, 36, 
40, and 48. Actually, 71 out of the 76 patients randomized to the PDT control group were 
exposed to Eylea. Safety data are presented for the entire study period through Week 52 by 
randomized treatment group (N=76 and 288, respectively) and additionally in the Eylea total 
group that includes all study patients who were exposed to Eylea (N=299; only AEs occurring 
during or after the first Eylea exposure are counted in the 71 original PDT patients who 
received Eylea from Week 28 onwards). 
ALTAIR (SN17668) was a randomized, open-label phase 4 study evaluating the efficacy and 
safety of repeated doses of intravitreal aflibercept with variable treatment intervals in 
Japanese subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Eligible subjects 
received an IVT injection of aflibercept at every scheduled treatment visit. After completion 
of treatment at Week 16, the timing of the subsequent treatment visits was determined at the 
previous treatment visit by the treating physician based on the criteria of the Treat and Extend 
regimen. Subjects who had completed the run-in phase were randomly assigned to one of the

two treatment arms of the study (2-week [2W] adjustment group or 4-week [4W] adjustment 
group) in 1:1 ratio at Week 16. A total of 247 patients were randomized, 7 patients were 
treated but not randomized. 
2W adjustment group (N=124): Aflibercept IVT injection at Week 0, Week 4, 
Week 8 and Week 16, followed by the variable treatment intervals based on the 
criteria of the Treat and Extend regimen. 
If the study eye of a subject met the respective criteria for shortening or extension, 
length of either extension or shortening of the treatment interval was 2 weeks from the 
last interval, respectively. 
4W adjustment group (N=123): Aflibercept IVT injection at Week 0, Week 4, 
Week 8 and Week 16, followed by the variable treatment intervals based on the 
criteria of the Treat and Extend regimen. 
Shortening of interval: If the study eye of a subject met the criteria for shortening, the 
treatment interval was shortened by 2 weeks. However, if the last treatment interval of 
a subject had been extended by 4 weeks from the second last interval, the treatment 
interval was shortened by 4 weeks. 
Extension: If the study eye of a subject met the criteria for extension, length of 
extension of the treatment interval was 4 weeks. However, when a subject had a 
history of receiving treatment with interval shortened by 4 weeks during this study, the 
length of the extension was 2 weeks. 
Subjects were evaluated at Week 52 and Week 96, regardless of treatment schedule. In study 
eyes, only the study drug was administered while fellow eyes could receive any domestically 
approved treatments. If a subject was judged to need any extra treatment in the study eye 
either using study drug or non-study treatment, the subject terminated the study. Ophthalmic 
evaluations were done at every treatment and evaluation visits other than visit for safety 
follow-up using visual acuity test with ETDRS score, slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy, 
and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Fundus photography (FP), FA and indocyanine 
green angiography (ICGA) were conducted at visit for screening, Week 52 and Week 96. In 
addition to these ophthalmic evaluations, general evaluation and vital sign assessment in 
subjects were used for safety evaluation methods. Aflibercept was administered every 
4 weeks until Week 8 (Run-in phase). Subjects who completed the Run-in phase were 
randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms of the study (2W adjustment group or 4W 
adjustment group) in 1:1 ratio at Week 16. After the IVT injection at Week 16, treatment was 
followed by a Treat and Extend regimen with variable treatment intervals up to Week 96 
(Treatment phase). During Week 16 to Week 96, treatment interval between two injections 
must not be less than 8 weeks and must not be more than 16 weeks. 
Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) studies in wet AMD 
CANDELA (VGFTe-HD-AMD-1905, SN 21086) was a randomized, single-masked, 
active-controlled Phase II study. The primary objectives of the study were to determine the 
safety of 8 mg aflibercept injection and to determine if 8 mg aflibercept provided greater 
intraocular pharmacodynamic effect and/or longer duration of action compared to 2 mg 
intravitreal aflibercept injection. The co-primary endpoints were: Safety, which was evaluated 
by assessment of treatment-emergent adverse events and serious adverse events through week 
4 and the proportion of patients without retinal fluid in the centre subfield at week 20. A total 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept)

Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
of 106 eligible patients were randomized into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. One group received 
2 mg aflibercept and the other 8 mg aflibercept. The latter was administered intravitreally 
monthly for 3 initial injections at baseline, week 4 and week 8, followed by additional doses 
at weeks 20 and 32. At weeks 24, 28, 36 and 40 patients were evaluated and given a dose (at 
their randomized dose level) if defined retreatment criteria were met. The duration of the 
study for a patient was approximately 44 weeks, excluding the screening period. The primary 
safety analysis took place at week 20, with exploratory endpoints evaluated at week 20 and 
week 44.  
PULSAR (SN 20968) is a Phase III randomized, double-masked, active-controlled study. The 
primary objective was to determine if treatment with 8 mg aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 
weeks provides non-inferior BCVA change compared to 2 mg aflibercept (administered every 
8 weeks, after 3 initial monthly doses). Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of 
8 mg aflibercept on other visual and anatomic outcomes (change of BCVA at week 60, 
proportion of patients with no intraretinal fluid and no subretinal fluid in the central subfield 
at week 16, proportion of patients gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline at week 
48, proportion of patients achieving an ETDRS letter score of at least 69 at week 48, change 
in neovascularization size from baseline to week 48, change in total lesion area from baseline 
to week 48, proportion of patients with no intraretinal fluid and no subretinal fluid in the 
center subfield at week 48, change from baseline in central subfield retinal thickness at week 
48). Further secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of 8 mg versus 2 mg aflibercept 
of the vision-related quality of life, the safety of aflibercept, the pharmacokinetics and 
immunogenicity of aflibercept. The application scheme for aflibercept in the three treatment 
groups was: 
•  2q8: 2 mg aflibercept administered every 8 weeks after 3 initial monthly doses 
•  HDq12: 8 mg aflibercept administered every 12 weeks after 3 initial monthly doses 
•  HDq16: 8 mg aflibercept administered every 16 weeks after 3 initial monthly doses 
CRVO studies 
In the Phase III CRVO study COPERNICUS (VGFT-OD-0819), patients received either 
Eylea or sham (2Q4) in the first 6 months (Week 24); in the second 6 months sham patients 
were able to receive active treatment depending on re-treatment criteria defined in the 
protocol. All subjects were allowed to continue PRN treatment through Year 2 (Week 100). 
In the Phase III CRVO study GALILEO (SN 14130), patients were treated either with Eylea 
or sham up to 52 weeks. During the 52 weeks study duration, sham patients were not foreseen 
to be treated with Eylea but could be treated with Eylea from Week 52 to Week 76. 
The pooled safety data of the 2 CRVO studies are shown for the entire study period from 
Baseline to Week 76/100 (the study period was 76 weeks in GALILEO and 100 weeks in 
COPERNICUS). Treatment groups for data presentation are based on original randomization, 
i.e., 142 patients randomized to sham with subsequent PRN treatment and 218 patients 
randomized to Eylea 2Q4 with subsequent PRN treatment. In addition, AEs in all patients 
from either randomization group who received at least one active injection with Eylea are 
summarized from the day when the first injection was administered (N=317; i.e., excluding 
the 43 patients of the sham-PRN group who never received Eylea, referred to as "Eylea total 
group").

BRVO study 
VIBRANT (VGFTe RVO-1027) was a randomized, double-masked, active controlled 
52-week study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of repeated IVT administration 
of Eylea compared with grid laser photocoagulation in subjects with macular edema 
secondary to BRVO. A total of 183 patients were randomized and exposed to study treatment 
(91 in the Eylea group and 92 in the laser group). The study was conducted by Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in North America (USA, Canada) and Japan. Patients in the Eylea group 
received Eylea 2Q4 through (including) Week 24, then 2Q8 through Week 48. Sham IVT 
injections were administered every 8 weeks starting from Week 28, alternating with Eylea 
injections every 8 weeks, through Week 44. The last active injection with Eylea was on 
Week 48. Patients in the Eylea group also received one sham laser treatment on Day 1. 
Rescue treatment with active laser in this group was possible, if patients had met the 
pre-defined criteria at Week 36. Patients randomized to the laser group received grid laser 
photocoagulation treatment at Day 1, and sham IVT injections every 4 weeks from Day 1 
through Week 48. Rescue treatment with laser was possible from Week 12 onwards 
(minimum intervals of 12 weeks from previous laser treatment) in those patients who had met 
the pre-specified criteria. Patients in the laser arm could become eligible for rescue treatment 
with Eylea beginning at Week 24. In this case, they were to receive 3 initial Eylea 2 mg 
injections every 4 weeks, followed by injections every 8 weeks. Safety data are presented in 
this RMP version for the final Week 52 study data as per randomized treatment group, i.e., 
based on the 91 patients in the VTE 2 mg group and the 92 patients in the Laser+VTE 2 mg 
group (i.e., patients randomized to initial treatment with laser through Week 20 and the option 
for Eylea rescue therapy beginning at Week 24). In addition, the Eylea total group (N=158) 
includes all patients who had received Eylea at least once (i.e., in addition to patients from the 
Eylea treatment group, the 67 patients in the Laser+VTE 2 mg group who had received rescue 
treatment with Eylea beginning at Week 24). In this group, all adverse events occurring after 
the first Eylea injection are counted. 
Myopic CNV study  
In the multi-center, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled, Phase III myopic CNV 
study MYRROR (SN 5170), a total of 122 Asian subjects with active subfoveal or 
juxtafoveal CNV secondary to pathologic myopia were randomized to receive either 
Eylea 2 mg or sham injection. The primary efficacy endpoint (mean change in BCVA) was 
evaluated after 24 weeks of treatment (injections from baseline through Week 20). In this 
study period, subjects in the Eylea group (N=91) received an active injection at Baseline and 
were then assessed at regular intervals of 4 weeks for the need of a repeated injection based 
on pre-defined re-treatment criteria (i.e., in case of recurring or persisting CNV). If no active 
injection was required, these subjects received a sham-injection. In the sham group (N=31), 
subjects underwent the same study-related procedures, but were solely treated with sham 
injections. 
After the primary endpoint assessment at Week 24, all patients randomized to sham who 
continued the study (N=25) received one mandatory injection with active Eylea and continued 
treatment in the same way as in the Eylea 2 mg group, i.e., active injections, when 
pre-specified retreatment criteria were met, or a sham injection otherwise. Patients were still 
monitored at monthly intervals; the last active injection could be given at Week 44, and the 
final study assessments were performed at Week 48.

Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
This RMP version includes the final MYRROR study results through Week 48. Safety results 
of the MYRROR are presented for treatment groups as randomized (i.e., Sham+Eylea 2 mg 
group [N=31] vs. Eylea 2 mg group [N=91]) and additionally for all patients who were treated 
with active Eylea at least once during the study period (Eylea total group [N=116]). 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) DME studies 
VIVID-DME (SN 91745) and VISTA-DME (VGFT-OD-1009) were both 3 year, 
randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, multi-center, Phase III studies of the efficacy 
and safety of repeated doses of Eylea in subjects with DME with central involvement. In 
VIVID-DME, a total of 404 subjects (SAF) were treated in European countries, Australia, and 
Japan. In VISTA-DME, a total of 461 subjects (SAF) were treated in the US. 6 The studies 
had nearly identical overall study designs and are described together unless otherwise 
indicated. 
Patients were randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups: Eylea 2Q4 to Week 148, 
Eylea 2Q8 (after 5 initial monthly doses), with sham injections at alternating visits, to 
Week 148, or laser photocoagulation through Week 148 plus sham injection. Subjects in the 
Eylea groups received sham laser at Baseline and at visits, at which subjects met the criteria 
for laser re-treatment (no more often than every 12 weeks). The last administration of study 
treatment in all treatment groups was at Week 144. 
Subjects in all groups were assessed for additional treatment (i.e., "rescue" treatment with 
Eylea for the laser subjects, and laser for the Eylea subjects) for inadequate responders at each 
visit starting at Week 24. Additional treatment was to be administered if pre-specified criteria 
were met. 
During Year 3, subjects randomized to the laser group who did not meet the criteria for 
additional treatment previously were allowed to receive Eylea as needed (PRN) according to 
the Eylea re-treatment criteria from Week 100 through the end of the study (Week 144). 
Fellow eye treatment for DME with anti-VEGF agents was allowed in both studies. In 
VIVID-DME, standard of care was used (including ranibizumab or bevacizumab; licensed 
treatment preferred). In VISTA-DME, VEGF Trap-Eye was provided and required as fellow 
eye treatment (although ranibizumab could be used, if VEGF Trap-Eye was unavailable due 
to logistical reasons). 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the change in ETDRS letter score from 
Baseline to Week 52. In this RMP version, the final safety-related results through Week 148 
are reported. The pooled DME safety results from VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME are 
presented with tabulated summaries using the following patient groups: 
•  Laser group (active control): All patients in the SAF randomized to initial treatment 
with laser. All treatment-emergent AEs up to study end (Week 148) are considered for 
the analysis. 
6 As per amendment No. 4, patients completing Visit 39 (Week 148) in VISTA-DME were allowed to receive 
further treatment extension with Eylea until the planned date for the last on-study patient to complete Visit 39 
(NOV 2014) in order to avoid a potential treatment gap between study end and availability of commercial Eylea. 
However, the exposure and safety analyses in VISTA-DME are aligned with VIVID-DME and thus limited to 
the last core study visit (i.e., Week 148). 
 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
•  VTE 2Q4 group: All patients in the SAF randomized to initial treatment with 2 mg 
VEGF Trap-Eye every 4 weeks. All treatment-emergent AEs up to study end 
(Week 148) are considered for the analysis. 
•  VTE 2Q8 group: All patients in the SAF randomized to initial treatment with 2 mg 
VEGF Trap-Eye every 4 weeks until Week 16 (i.e., a total of 5 initial monthly doses) 
and subsequent dosing intervals of 8 weeks (2Q8). All treatment-emergent AEs up to 
study end (Week 148) are considered for the analysis. 
•  VTE total (Eylea total group): All subjects (including patients randomized to the laser 
group) who have received at least one active Eylea injection in the study eye by 
Week 144. Considered are all treatment-emergent events that started after first study 
eye exposure to Eylea up to Week 148. 
For the interpretation of the DME safety results based on these groups, it should be 
considered that: 
•  Patients in all randomized treatment groups were allowed to receive fellow eye 
treatment with Eylea or other anti-VEGF therapies (this should be particularly 
considered for the assessment of potential systemic adverse events), 
•  Patients in the laser group were allowed to receive additional treatment of the study 
eye with Eylea from Week 24 onwards or Eylea PRN (if-re-treatment criteria were 
met and no additional treatment with Eylea was previously started) in the third year of 
the study (actually, 243 subjects in the laser group have received at least one 
additional or PRN treatment with Eylea by Week 144), 
•  Patients in either Eylea group were allowed to receive additional treatment of the 
study eye with active laser from Week 24 onwards (actually, 17 subjects in the 
2Q4 group and 32 subjects in the 2Q8 group have received at least one additional 
treatment with active laser by Week 144), and 
•  The group of subjects included in the VTE total group consisted of the 578 subjects 
who were enrolled in the Eylea groups plus the 243 subjects the laser group who had 
received additional (rescue) treatment with VTE in the study eye for varying amounts 
of time, depending upon when they met the criteria for additional treatment or PRN 
treatment with VTE (possible in Year 3). In these patients, TEAEs occurring at or 
after the first exposure to Eylea are considered. 
The study design of VIVID-EAST (SN 15161) was very similar to the designs of the pivotal 
studies VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME in the first year, and was conducted in China, 
Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation. The primary efficacy variable 
was the change from baseline in BCVA in ETDRS letter score at week 52. A total of 378 SAF 
patients were randomized to treatment with laser photocoagulation (N=124), the Eylea 2Q4 
(N=127), or Eylea 2Q8 (N=127). Laser patients were treated with laser photocoagulation at 
baseline and from week 12 onwards, if laser-re-treatment criteria were met. Patients in the 
Eylea 2Q4 group received Eylea 2 mg at monthly intervals continuously through Week 48, 
and patients in the Eylea 2Q8 group received Eylea 2 mg every 2 months following 5 initial 
injections at monthly intervals (i.e., from Baseline to including Week 16) through Week 48. 
As with the pivotal studies, additional treatment with Eylea in the laser group (or with laser in 
the Eylea groups) was permitted from Week 24 onwards in the case that pre-defined 
additional treatment criteria were met. The last study treatment was administered on Week 48; 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
final study assessments were performed at Week 52. The safety data are presented by 
randomized treatment group, and in the Eylea total group considering all TEAEs that occurred 
at or after the first administration of Eylea (N=299; i.e., the 254 patients initially randomized 
to Eylea treatment plus 45 laser group patients who received Eylea as additional treatment 
during the course of the study at Week 24 at the earliest). Generally, the aforementioned 
considerations about the interpretation of the safety data in the pivotal DME studies do also 
apply to VIVID-EAST. 
VIVID-JAPAN (SN 15657) was a 1-year, open-label Phase III study performed in Japan with 
a treatment schedule that was generally similar to the 2Q8 arm in the randomized, controlled 
studies, i.e., all subjects were treated (in an open-label fashion) with Eylea 2 mg every 
2 months (2Q8) after 5 initial doses at monthly intervals (i.e., 2Q4 up to Week 16). Last 
treatment was on Week 48; the final endpoint assessments were performed at Week 52. No 
additional treatment of the study eye with laser was permitted. Fellow eye treatment was 
allowed as per local standard of care/medical routine. Study assessments included 
effectiveness and safety of treatment as well as PK analyses. The safety analyses were 
performed without further stratification in a total of 72 subjects (one of the 73 enrolled and 
treated patient was excluded from the SAF because he/she withdrew consent). 
Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) DME studies 
PHOTON (VGFTe-HD-DME-1934, SN 21091) is a randomized, double-masked, 
active-controlled Phase II/III study. The primary objective of this study was to determine if 
treatment with 8 mg aflibercept at intervals of 12 or 16 weeks provides noninferior BCVA 
compared to 2 mg aflibercept dosed every 8 weeks. Secondary objectives are to determine the 
effect of 8 mg versus 2 mg aflibercept on anatomic and other visual measures of response, to 
evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics of 8 mg aflibercept. This study 
includes three randomization arms (1:2:1 ratio). One group receives 2 mg aflibercept every 
8 weeks following 5 initial monthly doses, one group receives 8 mg aflibercept every 
12 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses and the third group receives 8 mg aflibercept 
every 16 weeks following 3 initial monthly injections. The application scheme for aflibercept 
in this study with three treatment arms was: 
•  2q8: 2 mg aflibercept every 8 weeks, following 5 initial doses 
•  HDq12: 8 mg aflibercept every 12 weeks, following 3 initial monthly doses 
•  HDq16: 8 mg aflibercept every 16 weeks, following 3 initial monthly doses 
ROP studies 
FIREFLEYE (SN 20090) was a Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized, two arm, 
controlled study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of IVT 0.4 mg aflibercept 
compared to laser photocoagulation in preterm infants with ROP. The study consisted of a 
screening phase followed by a baseline visit when subjects were randomized either to 
aflibercept or laser (ratio: 2:1), followed by a 23-week treatment period, which equals a 
24 week total study duration. One or both eyes were treated based on the study eligibility 
criteria as assessed by the investigator. Subjects were also allowed to be retreated or 
administered rescue treatment (laser for the aflibercept arm; aflibercept for the laser arm). The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with absence of active ROP and 
unfavorable structural outcomes at 24 weeks after starting study treatment based on

Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
investigator’s assessment. Key secondary efficacy endpoints addressing the primary objective 
were subjects with requirement for intervention with a second treatment from baseline to 
Week 24 and subjects with recurrence of ROP from baseline to Week 24, which were also 
analysed using a similar Bayesian statistical model as for the primary endpoint. A total of 
118 subjects were randomized, 75 to aflibercept and 38 to the laser arm. This RMP version 
includes the final FIREFLEYE study results through Week 24. Safety results of the 
FIREFLEYE study are presented for treatment groups as randomized (i.e., Eylea 0.4 mg 
group [N=75] vs. Laser group [N=38]) and additionally for all patients who were treated with 
Eylea at least once during the study period (Eylea total group [N=79; i.e., the 75 patients 
initially randomized to Eylea treatment plus 4 laser group patients who received Eylea as 
rescue treatment during the course of the study]. 
FIREFLEYE NEXT (SN 20275) is a Phase IIIb study which follows up on ocular, 
neurodevelopmental and overall clinical outcomes until 5 years of age. All patients treated in 
the FIREFLEYE study were offered participation. 
Post-marketing data 
In addition to the clinical study data, the post-marketing cases for the important identified and 
potential risks, cumulating from market launch through cut-off date 15 SEP 2017, are 
provided (MedDRA version 20.0). These cases include spontaneously reported cases and 
cases from non-interventional studies (incl. solicited sources such patient support programs 
and market research programs), both medically confirmed and non-confirmed cases, and both 
valid and invalid cases (i.e., one case might include more than one patient). 
Invalid/incomplete cases in Bayer’s Global Pharmacovigilance Safety Database are defined as 
cases where at least one of the 4 minimal criteria is not fulfilled. These 4 minimal criteria are: 
i) identifiable patient, ii) identifiable reporter, iii) suspect Bayer product (in development or 
marketed drug/device), and iv) an adverse event. Adverse events can include reports of lack 
of drug effect, medication error, overdose, drug abuse, drug misuse, drug dependency, 
occupational exposure, pre-existing condition improved, off-label use, drug exposure via 
mother/father without adverse event and incident reports for medical devices. Reports which 
fulfil at least the two criteria “adverse event” and “suspect BHC medical product” according 
to the above definitions are recorded and fully processed in the MAH’s database. These cases 
are marked as invalid cases in the Global Pharmacovigilance Safety Database.

SVII.3.1  Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks 
SVII.3.1.1  Identified risk: Endophthalmitis (likely infectious origin) 
Potential mechanisms 
The intravitreal injection procedure can implant pathogens into the eye if there is a break in 
sterile technique. Source of pathogenic agents is in most cases the patient’s conjunctival 
bacterial flora. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering endophthalmitis as an important identified risk 
Inflammation of the inner structures of the eye (in particular the vitreous body, which fills the 
globe) may occur as a result of an infection with microorganisms, either through direct 
traumatic injury of the eye (exogenous infection) or through spreading of microorganisms 
from other areas of the body (endogenous infection). This pathogen-caused inner eye 
(intraocular) infection is called endophthalmitis. In cases of inflammation where no pathogens 
can be identified (no/negative culture growth of microorganisms observed), the condition may 
be characterized as "sterile endophthalmitis" or "non-infectious endophthalmitis". 
Because of the risk of severe vision loss, treatment should be initiated as soon as possible, 
and, depending on cause and severity, may consist of topical and intravitreal application of 
antibiotics, corticosteroids, and surgical removal of matter and infected structures (drainage, 
vitrectomy). The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who experienced endophthalmitis

recovered with sequelae (Table 1.3/3a). 
Table Source: Integrated Analysis - EU-RMP Pool 1 (AMD), Table 1.1.1/1 
The incidence of endophthalmitis in the Eylea treatment arms was very low (0.3%), which is 
below the incidence reported in the literature for IVT administration of VEGF inhibitors 
(1.0% to 1.1%; see background incidence/prevalence information).

Post-Marketing Data 
A total of 844 cases (including 880 events) belonging to the endophthalmitis group were 
reported by cut-off date 15 SEP 2017 (see Table SVII.8). 
An individual case review of the endophthalmitis cases was performed in order to check 
whether the diagnosis of endophthalmitis was substantiated by direct evidence of pathogens 
detected through e.g., tap culture. This review showed that in 232 of the 844 endophthalmitis 
cases (i.e., 27.5% based on all 844 cases or 66.9% based on the 347 cases with a documented 
test result) pathogen were identified. In the remaining cases, the samples were negative 
(115 cases), tests were performed but no outcomes provided (57 cases), or tests not 
reported/not performed (440 cases). 
Considering the sales figures and the estimated cumulative patient exposure in the post-
marketing period until 30 SEP 2017, the reporting rate of endophthalmitis cases (N=844) was 
0.05 cases per 1,000 sold vials (0.005%) and 0.36 cases per 1,000 patient years (0.036%), 
respectively. The incidence reported thus far during post-authorization use is within the 
reported incidence reported in the literature with the IVT injection of anti-VEGF agents and 
other drugs (see sections on incidence and prevalence).

Post-marketing Data 
Event severity is not routinely recorded on the post-marketing case report forms. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Incidence of endophthalmitis after IVT anti-VEGF injections 
A systematic review of 278 publications was published in 2011 to identify adverse events 
associated with anti-VEGF injections. Endophthalmitis was reported with incidence rates 
below or equal to 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02–0.08), 0.05 (95% CI: 0.03–0.10) per 100 injections for 
ranibizumab and bevacizumab7, respectively (199). Another systematic review identified 
5 controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy or safety of administration of anti-VEGF agents 
compared with conventional therapy in 383 preterm infants with ROP; no cases of 
endophthalmitis were reported (200). 
Reports from wet AMD studies 
The Phase III trials for ranibizumab (Lucentis®) – ranibizumab for wet AMD (MARINA) and 
ranibizumab versus verteporfin for wet AMD (ANCHOR) – demonstrated a low rate of 
endophthalmitis. At 96 sites in the US, of the 716 patients enrolled in the 2-year MARINA 
study, 478 patients received 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and 238 patients received sham 
injection. The endophthalmitis rate was 1.0% (5 of 477 patients), or, alternatively, a rate per 
injection of 0.05% (5 of 10,443 total injections) (201). Similar incidence rates of 1.1% (3 of 
277 patients or of 0.05% per injection (3 of 5,921) were reported in the ANCHOR study 
where 5,921 injections of ranibizumab were administered. In this study 423 patients were 
randomized 1:1:1 in 83 international sites to verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) plus 
monthly sham intraocular injection (n=143) or to sham verteporfin PDT plus monthly IVT 
ranibizumab (0.3 mg or 0.5 mg) injection (140 each in the 2 ranibizumab groups) (28). A 
review of safety data performed by Mitchell et al. reported that 3,252 patients in ANCHOR, 
MARINA, PIER, and SAILOR study received over 28,500 IVT ranibizumab injections. The 
overall rate of endophthalmitis in these studies was 0.05% per injection (41). 
In the United Kingdom (UK) a 12-month prospective, double masked, multicentre, 
randomized controlled trial (ABC Trial) enrolled 131 patients (mean age 81) from 3 centres 
with wet AMD to receive IVT bevacizumab (1.25 mg, 3 loading injections at 6-week intervals 
followed by further treatment if required at 6-week intervals, n=65) or the standard treatment 
available at the start of the trial (PDT with verteporfin for predominantly classic type wet 
AMD, n=16, or IVT pegaptanib, n=38, or sham treatment, n=12, for occult or minimally 
classic type AMD). There were no cases of endophthalmitis (202). 
In 2 Phase III multicentre trials (VISION I and II trial), which evaluated 2 years of therapy 
with pegaptanib sodium injection for wet AMD, a total of 7,545 IVT pegaptanib sodium 
injections and 2,557 sham injections were administered. A total of 1,190 patients were 
randomized to receive 0.3 mg, 1 mg, or 3 mg of pegaptanib sodium by intravitreous injection 
or sham injection every 6 weeks. The reported endophthalmitis incidence per injection was 
7 Please note that bevacizumab is not approved for treatment of ocular disorders and no formal PV system has 
been established in ophthalmological use. Thus, published data on bevacizumab might be limited.

0.16%. Most of the cases (75%) resulted from violations of the injection preparation protocol 
and the rate dropped to 0.07% in the 2nd year after reinforced aseptic procedure (203). During 
the 3rd year of the VISION trials 422 patients received 3,227 pegaptanib injections and the 
endophthalmitis rate per injection was 0.06% (204). 
No cases of endophthalmitis or intraocular inflammation were reported in the randomized 
controlled wet AMD-PCV studies LAPTOP over 12 months (205) or EVEREST study over 
6 months (206). 
Reports from CRVO studies 
A Phase III, prospective, randomized, sham controlled, double masked, multicenter clinical 
trial of ranibizumab injection in patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO (CRUISE 
Study) enrolled 392 patients to monthly IVT injections of 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg of ranibizumab 
(n=262) or sham (n=130) injections. The 6-month primary end point results reported no 
events of endophthalmitis (207), as did the 12-month primary end point results (208). The 
total number of injections was not published. 
A dose-ranging, double-masked, multicenter, sham controlled, Phase II trial included 
98 subjects with CRVO of ≤6 months duration and assigned them (1:1:1) to receive 
pegaptanib sodium (0.3 mg and 1 mg, n=33 each) or sham (n=32) injections every 6 weeks 
for 24 weeks. This study was conducted in practitioners’ offices and clinics in Australia, 
France, Germany, Israel, Spain, and the US. No subject developed endophthalmitis (209). The

The Pan American Collaborative Retina Study Group conducted an interventional, 
retrospective, comparative multicenter study with 63 patients (63 eyes) with macular edema 
secondary to BRVO that were treated primarily with IVT bevacizumab. Patients were 
recruited at 8 institutions in Costa Rica, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Mexico, 
Argentina, and Spain and had at least 24 months of follow-up. During the 24 months, there 
were 138 injections recorded in the 1.25 mg dose group and 109 injections in the 2.5 mg dose 
group. There were no cases of endophthalmitis (210). 
In a randomized controlled trial (211) of intravitreal 0.5-ranibizumab injection versus 
standard grid lase for macular edema following BRVO, there were no events of 
endophthalmitis, during the 12-month-long treatment period. A total of 36 patients with vision 
loss in one eye attributable to macular edema were included in the study. 
In a randomized controlled clinical trial (BRAVO) to the assess 12-month efficacy and safety 
of intraocular injections of 0.3 mg (n=134) or 0.5 mg ranibizumab (n=131) vs. sham treatment 
(n=132) in patients with macular edema secondary to BRVO (n=397) (159), one case of 
endophthalmitis was reported in the ranibizumab 0.5 mg treatment group (n=131, incidence 
0.8%). The follow-up study (HORIZON) on ranibizumab for macular edema due to RVO 
reported no cases of endophthalmitis (in BRVO or CRVO) during the 12 months follow-up 
period (212). 
The SCORE-BRVO study compared the efficacy and safety of 1 mg and 4 mg doses of 
intravitreal triamcinolone with standard of care (grid photocoagulation in eyes without dense 
macular haemorrhage and deferral of photocoagulation until haemorrhage cleared in eyes with 
dense macular haemorrhage) for eyes with vision loss associated with macular edema

secondary to BRVO. A total of 411 participants were randomized and followed for 
12 months. Through month 12, there were neither reports of infectious endophthalmitis in the 
standard of care group (n=137) nor in the 1 mg triamcinolone group (n=136), but one case 
(incidence =0.7%) was reported in the 4 mg triamcinolone group (n=138) 3 days after the 
third injection (155). 
In Russo et al. 2009 (bevacizumab compared with macular laser grid photocoagulation in a 
randomized, controlled study, in 30 consecutive eyes with macular edema in BRVO), no 
cases of endophthalmitis were reported (213). 
Parodi et al. (214), compared the effectiveness of sub-threshold grid laser treatment (SGLT) 
with infrared micropulse diode laser alone (n=13) or in combination with intravitreal 
triamcinolone injection (n=11) in BRVO patients. No endophthalmitis events were observed 
during the 12 months follow-up study period. 
In Donati et al. (215) evaluating in an open-label study the long-term efficacy of intravitreal 
bevacizumab (IVB) versus combined IVB and macular grid laser photocoagulation for the 
treatment of macular edema secondary to BRVO, no sterile or infectious endophthalmitis 
events were observed. 
Reports from myopic CNV studies 
In a case series, records of 35 consecutive patients who were treated with intravitreal injection 
of bevacizumab from 18 DEC 2008, through 20 JAN 2009 were reviewed. Of the 35 patients, 
five developed severe intraocular inflammation. There were three patients with myopic CNV, 
of whom one developed the condition. It was a 49-year-old woman who received one 
intravitreal bevacizumab injection and symptoms were identified four days after the injection. 
All five cases were culture negative (216). 
In a Japanese study, bevacizumab was aliquotted into smaller doses (5 mg/0.2 mL x 20). 
Intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) was injected into nineteen eyes of fifteen 
patients, two of whom (three eyes) had myopic CNV. Ocular inflammation occurred in 14 
eyes of 11 patients, including both of the myopic CNV patients (male age 61, female age 82 
in both eyes). Both myopic CNV patients required pars planta vitrectomy (217). 
No cases of endophthalmitis were reported through Month 12 in the myopic CNV study 
RADIANCE (218). 
Reports from DME studies 
A 12-month, randomized, sham controlled, double-masked, multicenter Phase II study of 
safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in DME with centre involvement (RESOLVE Study) 
enrolled 151 subjects to either ranibizumab (0.3 mg, n=51; or 0.5 mg, n =51) or sham 
treatment (n=49). Two cases of endophthalmitis were reported in the ranibizumab treatment 
group (2%) and no cases in the sham group (162). The total number of injections was not 
published. 
Two 24 month, parallel, methodologically identical, randomized, multicenter, double-masked,

ranibizumab (n=125 to 0.3mg and n=125 to 0.5mg) or sham injection (n=127) out of which 
one case of endophthalmitis occurred in the 0.3mg ranibizumab treatment group (0.8%) and 
no case of endophthalmitis in 0.5mg ranibizumab and sham group. Total number of injections

in sham group was 2,461, 0.3mg ranibizumab was 2,682 and 0.5mg ranibizumab was 2,628 in 
RISE study. In RIDE, 382 patients were randomized to either ranibizumab (n=125 to 0.3 mg 
and n=127 to 0.5 mg) or sham injection (n=130) out of which one case of endophthalmitis 
occurred in the 0.3mg ranibizumab treatment group (0.8%), two cases of endophthalmitis in 
0.5mg ranibizumab treatment group (1.6%) and no cases in sham group. Total number of 
injections in the sham group was 2,647, 0.3 mg ranibizumab was 2,560 and 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab was 2714 in the RIDE study (161). 
A 12-month, randomized, laser controlled, double masked, multicenter Phase III study to 
demonstrate superiority of ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy or combined with laser over 
laser alone in DME patients (RESTORE study). 345 patients were randomized to ranibizumab 
+ sham laser (n = 116), ranibizumab + laser (n = 118), or sham injections + laser (n = 111). 
No cases of endophthalmitis were reported in any treatment arms. Total number of injections 
in ranibizumab + sham laser was 800, ranibizumab + laser was 816 and sham injections + 
laser were 802 (219). 
A 6-month phase 2 randomized, multicenter clinical trial of intravitreal bevacizumab for 
DME conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net) at 
36 clinical sites in the US reported one case of injection-related endophthalmitis out of 
185 injections. In this study 121 patients (109 eligible for analysis) have been randomly 
assigned to one of five groups: focal photocoagulation at baseline (n=19), intravitreal 
injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks (n=22), intravitreal injection of 
2.5 mg bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks (n=24), intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg 
bevacizumab at baseline and sham injection at 6 weeks (n=22), or intravitreal injection of 
1.25 mg bevacizumab at baseline and 6 weeks with photocoagulation at 3 weeks (n=22) 
(220). 
In a Phase II randomized double-masked, sham controlled, trial of pegaptanib sodium for 
DME one case of endophthalmitis out of a total of 652 injections in 128 pegaptanib subjects 
occurred. The occurrence rate of endophthalmitis was 0.15% per injection or 0.8% per subject 
assigned to a pegaptanib group. No subject developed endophthalmitis in the sham group 
(n=42). This 36-week trial enrolled 172 patients with DME from 39 US sites (221). 
Reports from ROP studies 
Among 143 premature infants included in a prospective, controlled, randomized, stratified, 
multicenter trial to assess intravitreal bevacizumab monotherapy for zone I or zone II 
posterior stage 3+ (i.e., stage 3 with plus disease) ROP (BEAT-ROP), there were no cases of 
endophthalmitis reported (222). Two other clinical trials evaluated 79 and 50 infants with 
ROP randomized to bevacizumab/ranibizumab or in to laser therapy reported no cases of 
endophthalmitis (223, 224). 
Impact on individual patient 
Endophthalmitis can cause permanent loss of vision if it is not diagnosed at an early stage and 
appropriately treated. Vision loss as such constitutes a substantial burden for the involved 
subject. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Improper aseptic technique increases the risk of intraocular inflammation. 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
Preventability 
The risk of intraocular inflammation, especially if caused by pathogens, cannot be completely 
excluded, but may be minimized. In the scope of intravitreal injections of drugs for treatment 
of wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic CNV, DME (by which pathogens might be 
inadvertently carried into the inner eye) or ROP, it is absolutely crucial to work under strict 
aseptic and sterile conditions. Thus, only experienced and appropriately trained 
ophthalmologists should be charged with the injections. 
Moreover, patients should report to their doctors any signs or symptoms of intraocular 
inflammation (e.g., visual acuity decreased, pain, photophobia, or redness) in order to enable 
the treating physician to introduce appropriate countermeasures in due time. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). Furthermore, a 
specific questionnaire is used to gain more knowledge about this risk. 
This important identified risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact 
Severe intraocular infection/inflammation such as endophthalmitis can cause permanent loss 
of vision, if it is not rapidly diagnosed and appropriately treated. This condition is likely to 
impact the ability to work and to increase the dependency on caregivers. 
SVII.3.1.2  Identified risk: Intraocular inflammation 
Potential mechanism 
In a certain percentage the intraocular inflammation is culture negative. However, there are 
some difficulties in the definition and diagnosis of "sterile" endophthalmitis or intraocular 
inflammation. Many infectious cases are not diagnosed as such as no tap is performed, or tap 
is performed, but culture is false negative. Vice versa, true sterile cases may be false positive 
in culture (e.g., due to contamination of the medium) and thus misdiagnosed as infectious. 
The aetiology of sterile intraocular inflammations, independently of the administered drug, 
remains uncertain, and a multifactorial origin has been proposed. Needle trauma per se might 
cause a certain inflammatory reaction. Inflammation secondary both to IVT triamcinolone 
acetonide and to IVT bevacizumab (or other anti-VEGF agents) that manifest with acute and 
painless vision loss is usually interpreted as being primarily toxic and sterile. In these patients, 
visual acuity improves progressively as the intraocular inflammation reduces without any 
specific treatment. However, since there remains a substantial uncertainty on origin, the 
complication is often treated - on top of steroids and NSAID - like an acute (infectious) 
endophthalmitis with antibiotics because of the devastating visual prognosis of this 
intraocular infection in the absence of antibiotic therapy (225).

Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering intraocular inflammation as an important identified risk: 
Next to endophthalmitis/intraocular inflammations with an infectious origin, there are 
inflammations where no pathogens can be identified (either no culture performed or negative 
culture growth), the condition may be characterized as "sterile" inflammatory condition. 
The cause of a sterile inflammation, independently of the administered drug, remains 
uncertain, and a multifactorial origin cannot be discarded. An intraocular inflammation 
generally constitutes a serious condition, which may lead to generalized eye inflammation and 
risk of blindness. Treatment should be initialized as soon as possible, and, depending on cause 
and severity, may consist of topical and intravitreal application of antibiotics, corticosteroids, 
and surgical removal of matter and infected structures (drainage, vitrectomy). The proportion 
of Eylea-exposed adult patients who experienced intraocular inflammation in the study eye in 
the clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 0% to 2.6% (VIEW 1 & 2 AMD 2 mg studies).

Post-Marketing Data 
A total of 1,047 cases (including 1,277 events) with IOI terms were reported in the post-
marketing environment until 15 SEP 2017 (see following Table SVII.18). The most 
commonly reported preferred term events (>100 events) were “eye inflammation” 
(299 events), “non-infectious endophthalmitis” (295 events), “uveitis” (177 events), and 
“vitritis” (176 events). 
Considering the sales figures and the estimated cumulative patient exposure in the post-
marketing period until 30 SEP 2017, the reporting rate of IOI cases (N=1,047) was 0.07 cases 
per 1,000 sold vials (0.007%) and 0.45 cases per 1,000 patient years (0.045%), respectively. 
The incidence reported thus far during post-authorization use is within the reported incidence 
reported in the literature with the IVT injection of anti-VEGF agents and other drugs (see 
subsequent sections on background incidence and prevalence).

Wet AMD (Eylea 40 mg/mL, 0.5/2 mg doses) - Pivotal Clinical Trials VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 
(pooled data, 96 weeks) 
Serious IOIs were reported in one patient in the ranibizumab group (resolved non-infectious 
endophthalmitis; 0.2%) and in one patient in the Eylea 2Q8 group (resolved iridocyclitis; 
<0.1% of all Eylea-treated patients). 
Event outcomes are described in the following Table SVII.19. In 38 patients (2.1%) in the 
Eylea total group the events were resolved, while 7 patients (0.4%) experienced events that 
were not resolved (one patient with anterior chamber cell, one patient with anterior chamber 
flare, 4 patients with vitreal cells, and one patient with vitritis).

Post-marketing Data 
Event severity is not routinely recorded on the post-marketing case report forms. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Post-injection, sterile intraocular inflammation is a known risk following intravitreal 
injections of anti-VEGFs and for other intravitreally applied drugs.8  
Incidence rates reported in the literature can vary from 0.02% to 0.3% and have been reported 
to often occur in clusters. In the largest retrospective case series reported to date, 
Moshfeghi et al. described 12 cases (11 patients) out of 60,322 anti-VEGF injections 
(bevacizumab n=7; ranibizumab n=5) that developed post-injection inflammation (0.02% per 
injection) (226). Day et al. conducted a retrospective, longitudinal case-control study using 
the Medicare 5% claims database. Based on an evaluation of 40,903 intravitreal injections of 
anti-VEGF agents in wet AMD, an endophthalmitis rate of 0.09% (37 cases) and a uveitis rate 
of 0.11% (45 cases) were reported (227). Chong et al. reported 44 cases of sterile 
inflammation after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (0.27% of 16,166 injections). 
Seventeen inflammatory reactions were clustered around specific dates, which suggests a 
possible relation to drug preparation, though a specific cause remains unclear (228). 
In Ness et al., a cluster of 10 cases of "toxic vitritis" developed after intravitreal injection of 
bevacizumab - 6 patients were culture-negative and the remaining 4 were not cultured. The 
authors attributed these cases to a toxic reaction from the syringe brand used. No further cases 
occurred after changing to another brand of syringe (229). 
Roth et al. described a cluster of 7 patients out of 104 who developed culture negative 
endophthalmitis, following triamcinolone injection for macula oedema. All 7 cases 
experienced painless, but severe inflammation within 2 days of intravitreal injection (230).

Impact on individual patient 
Severe intraocular infection/inflammation can cause permanent loss of vision, if it is not 
diagnosed at an early stage and appropriately treated. Vision loss as such constitutes a 
substantial burden for the involved subject. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Improper aseptic technique increases the risk of intraocular inflammation. 
Preventability 
Measures other than aseptic injection techniques to prevent infectious reactions are not known 
to minimize the risk of IOI. It is crucial to work under strict aseptic and sterile conditions. 
Thus, only experienced and appropriately trained ophthalmologists should be charged with 
the injection procedure. 
Moreover, patients should report to their doctors any signs or symptoms of intraocular 
inflammation (e.g., visual acuity decreased, pain, photophobia, or redness) as soon as possible 
in order to enable the treating physician to introduce appropriate countermeasures in due time. 
Impact on risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). Furthermore, a 
specific questionnaire is used to gain more knowledge about this risk. 
This important identified risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact 
Severe intraocular infection/inflammation can cause permanent loss of vision, if it is not 
rapidly diagnosed and appropriately treated. This condition is likely to impact the ability to 
work and to increase the dependency on caregivers. 
SVII.3.1.3  Identified risk: Transient intraocular pressure increase 
Introductory note: 
The subsequent analyses are based on the frequency of adverse events coded to the MedDRA 
preferred terms "intraocular pressure increased" or "ocular hypertension". Inherently, the 
combined term "intraocular pressure (IOP) increase" does not include information about the 
duration/persistence of the events. Therefore, the outcome of the adverse events should also 
be taken into consideration in order to evaluate the occurrence of transient (i.e., "resolved") 
events of increased intraocular pressure. 
Potential mechanisms 
Transient IOP increase is attributed to an increase in vitreous volume (volume effect). 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering transient intraocular pressure increase as an important identified 
risk: 
Due to the filling of the eye-ball with liquids (i.e., aqueous and vitreous humour), there is an 
inherent pressure in the eye, which is measured in the same unit as the blood pressure is (i.e., 
in millimetre Mercury; mmHg). Normal pressure in the inner eye is approximately 
10-21 mmHg. Elevated eye pressure is a major risk factor for a condition called "glaucoma", 
which is characterized by a loss of nerve fibres in the optic nerve with the subsequent risk of 
blindness. However, many different factors may be responsible for the development of 
glaucoma, and increased intraocular pressure is not a mandatory prerequisite for the 
development of glaucoma (e.g., the condition of normal-tension glaucoma is well-known). In 
the scope of intravitreal injections, it is easily comprehensible that the volume load caused by 
the application of the drug, which is dissolved in a certain amount of injection liquid, will lead 
to a transient increase of intraocular pressure at least until the surplus fluid will have been 
resorbed from the inner eye. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who experienced an increase in intraocular 
pressure in the study eye in the clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 2.8% (VIVID-JAPAN 
DME study) to 13.6% (CRVO studies GALILEO & COPERNICUS). 
Evidence sources: refer to the linked subsection.

group (0.1% of the 821 patients who had received Eylea at least once). 
The outcome of the reported events is summarized in the following Table SVII.42. The IOP 
increase was "resolved" (88 subjects) in the majority of the 100 subjects in the total Eylea 
group, whereas 8 patients did not recover. Overall, most of the reported adverse events of

Post-marketing Data 
Event severity is not routinely recorded on the post-marketing case report forms. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
AMD/CRVO 
No publications on transient intraocular pressure increase due to study disease were identified. 
BRVO 
In the following three out of five clinical trials involving BRVO subjects no intra-ocular 
pressure (IOP) increase was reported: 
Campochiaro et al. 2010 (231) (ranibizumab 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg vs. sham treatment), 
Russo et al. 2009 (213) (Bevacizumab compared with macular laser grid photocoagulation), 
and Donati et al. 2012 (215) (combined intravitreal bevacizumab and grid laser 
photocoagulation). 
In SCORE–BRVO 2009 (155) (intravitreal triamcinolone vs. standard of care), IOP increase 
requiring medication was observed in 2%, 8%, and 41% in the standard of care group, 1 mg 
triamcinolone group, and 4 mg triamcinolone group, respectively. IOP >10 mmHg was 
observed in the 4 mg triamcinolone group (36%) compared with the 1 mg triamcinolone (9%) 
and standard of care (3%) group. 
Parodi et al. 2008 (214) (intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide combined with sub-threshold 
grid laser treatment compared to simple laser grid) described an increase in IOP in 54% of the 
24 study patients, which required treatment. 
Myopic CNV 
A prospective study (Gharbiya et al. 2009) to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of 
intravitreal bevacizumab for the treatment of myopic CNV was conducted in Italy on 
20 patients. At month 12 follow-up, no significant intraocular pressure (IOP) changes in the 
treated eyes were observed: mean IOP values (± SD) at baseline and at month 12 were 
respectively 14.2 (± 2.21) mmHg and 13.75 (± 2.46) mmHg (p=0.35) (232). 
An open-label study (Ikuno et al. 2010) to compare the long-term visual and anatomic 
outcome of treatment with photodynamic therapy or intravitreal bevacizumab for myopic 
CNV was conducted on 31 eyes of Japanese women. No transient IOP increase was reported 
(233). 
Another retrospective study of 63 patients conducted in Japan by the same investigator 
(Ikuno et al. 2009) aimed at assessing the potential effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on 
retinal function and anatomic recovery in eyes with myopic CNV. No IOP increase was 
reported (234). 
In a prospective study (Osaka University) to compare the visual outcomes of intravitreal 
bevacizumab and sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for choroidal neovascularization 
attributable to myopic CNV, 53 patients participated. In the sub-Tenon TA group, 3 eyes 
(15%) had an IOP of more than 21 mmHg that was managed with antiglaucoma medications 
(235).

DME 
In a Phase III controlled study, 197 patients with diabetic macular edema were randomized to 
receive a fluocinolone 0.5 mg implant, or standard of care (macular grid laser/observation). 
Glaucoma was reported in 9% of patients treated with the fluocinolone implant and in 0% of 
patients treated with photocoagulation. The study did not describe transient IOP increases 
(236). 
A Korean study compared the efficacy of posterior sub-Tenon’s capsule triamcinolone 
acetonide injection combined with modified grid macular photocoagulation (PSTI + MP) with 
intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injection in the treatment of diffuse DME. Forty 
eyes of 33 patients with diffuse DME were randomly allocated to either treatment. IOP was 
measured using a Goldman applanation tonometer. Between-group comparisons revealed 
significant differences in mean IOP changes at 1 month and 3 months (p=0.006, p=0.026, 
respectively). Three of 20 (15%) eyes in the IVTA group developed IOP elevation which 
exceeded 21 mmHg; and this was controlled with topical anti-glaucomatous agents. The 3 
eyes with elevated IOP belonged to three different patients. No eye that received a posterior 
sub-Tenon injection developed increased IOP exceeding 21 mmHg (237). 
Two 24 month, parallel, methodologically identical, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, 
sham injection-controlled, Phase III studies (RISE and RIDE) to evaluate efficacy and safety 
of intravitreal ranibizumab in DME. In RISE, 377 patients were randomized to either 
ranibizumab (n=125 to 0.3mg and n=125 to 0.5mg) or sham injection (n=127) out of which 
no case of increased IOP was reported in RISE study. In RIDE, 382 patients were randomized 
to either ranibizumab (n=125 to 0.3mg and n=127 to 0.5mg) or sham injection (n=130) out of 
which one case of increased IOP occurred in the 0.5mg ranibizumab treatment group (0.8%) 
and no case of increased IOP was reported in 0.3mg ranibizumab and sham group. The study 
did not specify if the increase in IOP was transient, but the event was considered a serious 
adverse event (161). 
A 12-month, randomized, sham controlled, double-masked, multicenter Phase II study of 
safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in DME with centre involvement (RESOLVE Study) 
enrolled 151 subjects to either ranibizumab (0.3 to 0.6 mg, n=51; or 0.5 to 1mg, n=51) or 
sham treatment (n=49). Six cases of transient IOP increase were reported in 0.3 to 0.6mg 
ranibizumab treatment group (11.8%) and 15 cases of transient IOP increase were reported in 
0.5 to 1mg ranibizumab treatment group (29.4%) and one case of transient IOP increase in 
sham group (2%) (162). 
A 12-month, randomized, laser controlled, double masked, multicenter Phase III study to 
demonstrate superiority of ranibizumab 0.5 mg monotherapy or combined with laser over 
laser alone in DME patients (RESTORE study). 345 patients were randomized to ranibizumab 
+ sham laser (n=116), ranibizumab + laser (n = 118), or sham injections + laser (n=111). One 
patient each in ranibizumab arms experienced IOP increase and none in sham group. Both 
cases of IOP resolved on their own and investigator related it to the injection procedure and 
not to the drug (219). 
ROP 
No publications of clinical studies reporting transient intraocular pressure increase among 
premature infants with ROP were found.

Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
Impact of individual patient 
Transient IOP increase is usually a mild reaction which is compensated within 0.5 – 1 hours 
after injection so that IOP normalizes back to baseline values. Patients recovered without 
sequelae (195, 197). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with glaucoma. 
Increased intraocular pressure is a known adverse drug reaction on treatment with intravitreal 
corticosteroids. 
Preventability 
Intraocular pressure should be checked after each injection. As the transient increase of eye 
pressure is an inherent result of the procedure-related volume load in the scope of intravitreal 
injections, there is no reasonable chance to avoid this effect. However, this effect is usually 
transient, and there is no robust evidence so far that pressure increases following intravitreal 
injections (even after multiple injections) could become durable or may lead to clinically 
relevant glaucoma. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). Furthermore, a 
specific questionnaire is used to gain more knowledge about this risk. 
This important identified risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact 
Due to the transient and usually mild nature of the condition, no impact of this safety concern 
on public health issues is expected. 
SVII.3.1.4  Identified risk: Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Potential mechanisms 
Development of RPE tears after anti-VEGF intravitreal injection has been attributed to a 
decline in intercellular adherence, thereby increasing susceptibility to tearing of the RPE layer 
(238). 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering retinal pigment epithelial tear as an important identified risk: 
The retinal pigment epithelium is the outer layer of the retina. Tears in that layer may occur 
secondary to AMD, following intravitreal injections, or for unknown reasons. These tears 
may be self-sealing or may require sealing by laser coagulation. 
In clinical trials up to 1.9% of patients with underlying wet AMD who were treated with 
Eylea developed a tear of the outer layer of the retina, whilst none of the patients with

Post-marketing Data 
Event severity is not routinely recorded on the post-marketing case report forms. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Wet AMD: 
RPE tears have been reported in patients with wet AMD in the absence of treatment, 
particularly when a pigment epithelial detachment (PED) is present. Incidence rates for 
spontaneous RPE tears ranged between 2%-6% of eyes with AMD (239-241) and between 
10%-25% in eyes with AMD and pigment epithelial detachments (PED) (241). The most 
important predisposing risk factor appears to be PED size as measured by basal diameter 
(240) and vertical height (17, 239). Also, eyes with serious RPE detachment appear to be 
more vulnerable to RPE tears (242). 
CRVO: 
No data identified. 
BRVO: 
No findings were identified. All reviewed BRVO studies did not report any RPE tears. 
Myopic CNV: 
In the Osaka University study, 114 of the 707 participants were myopic CNV patients. There 
were no reports of RPE tears among them (243). 
In a consecutive prospective study to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal 
bevacizumab in the treatment of CNV secondary to pathological myopia 17 patients 
participated. During a six months follow-up one RPE tear was reported after the first injection 
(244). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
No findings of RPE tears were reported in the two studies by Ikuno et al. (233, 234) and 
Gharbiya et al. 2009 (232), and the rest of the reviewed publications. 
DME: 
No data identified. 
ROP: 
No data identified. 
Additional considerations on RPE tears as class effect: 
RPE tears have also been reported following treatment of the neovascularization, regardless of 
whether the treatment was delivered intravitreally (pegaptanib sodium, bevacizumab, 
ranibizumab) or through other means (argon or krypton laser photocoagulation, transpupillary 
thermotherapy, photodynamic therapy with verteporfin) (193, 196, 245-254). 
Development of RPE tears after anti-VEGF intravitreal injection has been attributed to a 
decline in intercellular adherence, thereby increasing susceptibility to tearing of the RPE layer 
(238).  
The incidence of RPE tears during ranibizumab treatment was 0.4% (201). 
Salz et al. (241) concluded in their review that the overall incidence of RPE tears in eyes with 
wet AMD was similar regardless of whether an anti-VEGF agent was used, and that patients 
receiving anti-VEGF therapy were more likely to develop a tear earlier than untreated 
patients, most probably related to the accelerated involution induced by VEGF inhibition. 
According to Chang and Seraf (240), all cases of RPE tear associated with anti-VEGF 
treatment occurred in the setting of wet AMD. Information on RPE in the CRVO population 
from the published literature is scarce. Below are some findings: 
Data from a study of 707 patients (1,300 injections) who visited Osaka University Hospital, 
Japan, and received one or repeated IVT injections of bevacizumab were reviewed. Each 
patient was followed for AEs for two months post injections. No cases of RPE were reported 
among the 88 CRVO/BRVO patients. The one reported case of RPE occurred in a patient 
with AMD (243). 
Overall, the total incidence of RPE tears with Eylea in the AMD Phase III trials was in line 
with the known background incidences from literature; no RPE tears occurred in the 
CRVO/BRVO studies, in the myopic CNV study, or in the DME studies through Week 148. 
The promotion of RPE tear development by IVT treatment with Eylea is, therefore, deemed 
unlikely. 
Impact on individual patients 
RPE tears may lead to a loss of vision (and thus to legal blindness). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Wet AMD with pigment epithelial detachment; treatment of neovascularization. 
Preventability 
The underlying mechanisms resulting in RPE tears following intravitreal injection are not yet 
understood and thus, no preventive measure are currently known.

Impact on risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). 
This important identified risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact 
The potential public health impact of this safety concern is considered to be low, due to the 
low frequency of serious or severe events in clinical trials. 
SVII.3.1.5  Identified risk: Cataract (especially of traumatic origin) 
Potential mechanisms 
Related to IVT procedure. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering cataract (especially of traumatic origin) as an important 
identified risk: 
Generally, clouding of the usually clear eye lens is called a cataract. Cataract may occur 
spontaneously (particularly in the elderly), as a side effect of certain drugs, or following 
outside influences such as irradiation or mechanical injury (traumatic cataract). 
If the needle used to inject Eylea touched the lens in the patient’s eye this could cause such a 
traumatic cataract. There is currently no evidence that the occurrence of a traumatic cataract is 
increased on treatment with Eylea. However, as this might be a hypothetical result of the lens 
perforation, it has been included as potential important risk. 
The proportion of Eylea-exposed adult patients who experienced traumatic cataract in the 
study eye in the clinical studies with Eylea ranged from 0% to 2.8% (VIVID-DME & VISTA-
DME). 
Evidence sources: refer to the linked subsection.

A study comparing different IVT administered drugs suggested that the occurrence of 
traumatic cataract events is statistically independent of the injected drug, and patients’ age 
(255). The 96 weeks incidence of 0.8% of traumatic cataract is in a similar range of 
incidences derived from other studies which ranged from 0.2% to 0.6% of patients 
experiencing traumatic cataracts (256), see also the section on background incidence and 
prevalence. 
Wet AMD (Eylea 40 mg/mL, 0.5/2 mg doses) – VIEW 1 long-term extension study 
All cataracts: 
Cataracts in the study eye during the extension period occurred in 45 patients (8 patients 
[11.6%] in the former randomized ranibizumab group and 37 patients [14.6%] in the former

All cataracts: 
Cases of cataract were infrequent in the ALTAIR study, since only 2 patients in the 2W 
adjustment group and 1 patient in the 4W adjustment group experienced such events (1.6% 
based on 124 patients randomized to the 2W adjustment group or 0.8% based on 123 patients

All cataracts: 
Cataracts in the study eye occurred in 7.6% of patients on Eylea treatment (24 patients, Table 
SVII.66). The incidence was higher in the Eylea 2Q4+PRN group than in the Sham+PRN 
group (9.2% vs. 4.9%) but, in view of the small absolute number of events, no clinically 
meaningful differences were observed between the 2 randomized treatment groups.

Injection-related (traumatic) cataracts: 
In both, the aflibercept 8 mg dose treatment group (HDq16) and the aflibercept 2 mg dose 
treatment group, 1 patient experienced an injection-related cataract in the study eye. These 
events were both considered non-serious. Outcome was reported as “not recovered” in the 
aflibercept 2 mg dose treatment group and as “unknown” in the aflibercept 8 mg dose 
treatment group. 
Post-marketing Data 
Most of the 786 reported cataract events were serious (651 events), while 135 events were 
non-serious (see previous post-marketing table on cataract events). 
Reported outcomes were "recovered/resolved" in 159 events, "recovering/resolving" in 
95 events, "recovered/resolved with sequelae" in 2 events, and "not recovered/not resolved" in 
165 events (missing or unknown outcomes in the remaining 365 events).

Post-marketing Data 
Event severity is not routinely recorded on the post-marketing case report forms. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Historically, traumatic cataract (TC) has been reported in patients receiving IVT injections, 
but limited information is available about cataract development or progression after 
intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors. In addition, due to differences in the way cataract 
and/or “traumatic cataract” have been defined or reported in such studies, the direct 
comparison of some reported rates could be difficult. Special attention should be given to the 
type of cataract the reported rates represent. 
Several studies involving intravitreal injection (including ranibizumab, pegaptanib sodium, 
and triamcinolone acetonide) reported no findings of traumatic cataract (165, 257-260). 
Still, a limited number of reports revealed of low frequency of traumatic cataract associated 
with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or triamcinolone (203, 253, 255, 
256, 261, 262). Holz et al. specified 1 TC out of 513 patients (0.2%), Sorensen and Kemp 
reported one TC out of 647 eyes, and Jonas et al. reported that three eyes out of 5,403 
injections (two in bevacizumab and one in triamcinolone acetonide) showed “progressive 
cataract” in a case series (255, 256, 262). The VISION study reported 5 TC events in 
892 subjects (0.07%/injection) exposed to pegaptanib (203). 
AMD: 
In two double-blind placebo-controlled Pegaptanib trials involving 1208 patients, about 1% of 
patients developed cataract (263).

Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
CRVO: 
Several cohort and randomized studies on CRVO patients treated with different modalities 
reported information on traumatic cataract as an event to be noted: 
A multicenter randomized, sham injection-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of 
intraocular injections of 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab in patients with macular edema after 
CRVO. A total of 392 patients participated. At the end of 6 months the numbers of cataract 
cases were: 0/129 for sham, 2/132 (1.6%) for the 0.3 mg treatment group and 2/129 (1.6%) 
for the 0.5 mg group (207). At the end of 12 months follow-up of this study there were 
7/131 cases (5.3%) of cataract in the sham group, 6/134 (4.5%) in the 0.3 mg group, and 
8/130 (6.2%) in the 0.5 mg group (208). 
BRVO: 
A prospective, randomized, dose-finding study was performed to assess the efficacy and 
safety of IVT pegaptanib sodium for macular edema secondary to BRVO. Twenty subjects 
from three clinical practices in the United States with BRVO of more than 1 month and fewer 
than 6 months' duration were randomized 3:1 to IVT injections of pegaptanib 0.3 or 1 mg at 
Baseline and at weeks 6 and 12 with subsequent injections at 6-week intervals at investigator 
discretion until week 48. No cases of traumatic cataract were observed (260). 
No other traumatic cataract events have been mentioned in the BRVO studies that have been 
reviewed. 
Myopic CNV: 
No data were identified. 
DME: 
A Korean study compared the efficacy of posterior sub-Tenon's capsule triamcinolone 
acetonide injection combined with modified grid macular photocoagulation (PSTI + MP) with 
intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA) injection in the treatment of diffuse diabetic 
macular edema (DME). Forty eyes of 33 patients with diffuse DME were randomly allocated 
to either treatment. Examinations were carried out at baseline and also at 1 month, 3 months 
and 6 months after treatment. 
The average increases in cataract grading (based on the Lens Opacities Classification System 
III (LOCS III), compared to baseline values, were 0.62 ± 0.81 (mean ± SD) in the PSTI + MP 
group and 1.54 ± 1.33 in the IVTA group; the latter being significantly higher than the former 
(p = 0.043, Student’s t-test). Significant cataract progression that necessitated cataract surgery 
was noted in 1 of 13 (7.7%) phakic eyes in the IVTA group, but in none of the eyes treated 
with posterior sub-Tenon injections (237). 
In a Phase III controlled study, 197 patients with diabetic macular edema were randomized to 
receive a fluocinolone 0.5mg implant, or standard of care (macular grid laser/observation). 
Among phakic patients, cataract developed in 43.1% of patients treated with the fluocinolone 
implant and in 7.3% of patients treated with standard of care based on 34-week data. Patients 
in this trial will be followed for an additional 2.5 years (236). 
The randomized trial of the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Group evaluated 
Ranibizumab vs. triamcinolone for treatment of DME. The two year cumulative cataract 
surgery events in the triamcinolone + prompt laser group was considerably higher (59%) than 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part II – Module SVII: Identified and Potential Risks 
the rates for the sham + prompt laser group or the ranibizumab groups (14% and 14%, 
respectively; P<0.001 for both comparisons) (264). 
ROP: 
Three randomized trials reported the outcome cataract using eyes as the denominator (222-
224). Of these, two trials did not report any case of cataract in either of the groups ((223, 
224). The BEAT-ROP trial did not find any significant difference in the incidence of lens 
opacity requiring cataract removal between the two groups (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79) 
(222). 
Impact on individual patient 
Development of cataract may impair vision and thus may require cataract surgery in order to 
remove the lens opacification. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Cataract is a known adverse drug reaction on treatment with IVT corticosteroids. 
Preventability 
By correct IVT procedure and a correct angle of the needle while injecting a cataract could be 
prevented. This is common knowledge of injecting physicians. 
Impact on risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526).  
This important identified risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact: 
Patients experiencing (traumatic) cataract may require cataract surgery. 
SVII.3.1.6  Potential risk: Medication errors 
Potential mechanism 
Not applicable. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering medication error as an important potential risk: 
Two milligram (2 mg) aflibercept is provided in vial or a pre-filled syringe format while 8 mg 
aflibercept is currently available in a vial format only. In both vial and PFS presentations, 
excess volume is to be expelled during the priming step before injecting the recommended 
dose. Thus, injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe/vial would result in overdose. 
However, this numerical overdose is limited, and the drug will be administered only by 
qualified physicians (not by patients), and this reduces the risk of inappropriate dosing and 
administration as well.  Proper adherence to the instructions for use when using the PFS/vial 
is key to avoid overdosing.

Characterization of the risk 
Frequency 
Wet AMD (Eylea 40 mg/mL, 0.5/2 mg dose) - Pivotal Clinical Trials VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 
(pooled data, 96 weeks) 
Through the 2-year period in the Phase III AMD studies, 10 cases of overdose in 36,203 
injections (including 9,810 ranibizumab injections) have been reported. Two overdose reports 
were with ranibizumab (0.02% of injections) and 8 with Eylea (0.03% of injections). In one 
case, 10-fold the dose and volume of the study drug was administered. Three of the patients 
experienced a transient increase of IOP. The IOP increase was probably associated with the 
larger volume administered. In the other cases, no AEs occurred. All patients recovered 
without sequelae. (Note: not all of above occurrences necessarily reported PTs pertaining to 
medication error). 
PTs pertaining to medication error occurred in 4 patients (0.7%) who were treated with 
ranibizumab, compared to 5 patients (0.3%) in the combined group of patients on treatment 
with Eylea (Table SVII.102).

Post-Marketing Data 
By 15 SEP 2017, a total of 3,245 cases of medication error were reported with 3,577 events. 
The 5 most frequently reported preferred term events were “inappropriate schedule of drug 
administration” (1,476 events), “drug dose omission” (583 events), “product use issue” 
(523 events), “multiple use of single-use product” (263 events), and “product use in 
unapproved indication” (172 events). 
Vial/dose fractioning (coded to PT “multiple use of single-use product”) is a common practice 
in some countries, and it might be supported by some health insurances. This PT was reported 
in 263 cases (with 263 events) and more than half of these cases (138 cases) were invalid, 
while 125 cases were valid. Most of the valid cases were associated with intraocular 
inflammations/infections which is an established and labelled ADR of the Eylea injection. For 
these cases it remains unknown whether the procedure of vial splitting contributed to the 
development of an intraocular infection. Overall, no increase in reporting rates for reported 
intraocular inflammations/infections was observed over the years worldwide, and to date, the 
reported number of cases with vial fractioning is considered low. 
In view of the large number of vials sold by 15 SEP 2017 (almost 16 million), there is no 
indication that medication errors might be a relevant issue of treatment with Eylea in routine 
care. Numerically, the reporting rate of cases with medication error (N=3,245) was 0.20 cases 
per 1,000 sold vials (0.020%) and 1.40 cases per 1,000 patient years of exposure (0.140%), 
respectively.

In the FIREFLEYE study (no case reported in the FIREFLEYE NEXT study) 1 case of 
medication error in the VTE total group was documented as non-serious and one as serious 
(“overdose”), both events were completely resolved.  
Wet AMD and DME (Eylea 114.3 mg/mL, 8 mg dose, injection volume: 70 µL) - Pooled data 
sets from the wet AMD CANDELA study (44 weeks), the wet AMD PULSAR study 
(48 weeks), and the DME PHOTON study (48 weeks): 
No patients with medication error were reported in the 8 mg dose studies CANDELA, 
PULSAR or PHOTON. 
Post-marketing Data 
A few of the reported medication error cases were considered serious (49 cases [1.5% of all 
3,245 cases] with 52 events [1.5% of all 3,577 events]; see previous post-marketing table). 
For most of the 3,577 cases, the event outcome was unknown or not reported (3,283 events). 
Specified event outcomes were “recovered/resolved” (159 events), “recovering/resolving” 
(21 events), “recovered/resolved with sequelae” (one event), and “not recovered/not resolved” 
(113 events).

SVII.3.1.7 Potential risk: Off-label use and misuse 
Potential mechanism 
Not applicable. 
Evidence of source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering off-label use and misuse as an important potential risk: 
As with other drugs, Eylea might be intentionally used other than recommended, or in clinical 
conditions outside the approved indications (so-called off-label use). Since the clinical 
experience with Eylea in such off-label use will be limited (in particular in terms of efficacy 
and safety), any case of off-label use will be considered a potential risk. Since Eylea has no 
dependence potential, the risk of misuse is regarded as very low. 
Evidence sources: refer to the linked subsection. 
MedDRA search terms (version 19.1 for adult clinical 2 mg studies, version 20.0 for PM data 
and version 23.1 for ROP studies in preterm infants, version 25.0 for 8 mg dose in wet AMD 
and DME): 
Preferred term included in search: Off-label use, intentional device misuse, intentional 
overdose, and intentional product misuse. 
Characterization of the risk 
Frequency: 
Phase III-IV clinical 2 mg studies (AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic CNV, DME, and ROP) 
There were no reports of off-label use or misuse in the herein reported Phase III-IV trials in 
wet AMD, CRVO, BRVO, myopic CNV, DME, and ROP.  
There were no reports of off-label use or misuse in the Phase II-III clinical studies (wet AMD 
and DME) for the 8 mg dose of aflibercept. 
Post-Marketing Data 
Cases of off-label use were identified based on a concept that considered events of intentional 
drug use outside of the authorized product information in therapeutic intention as reported by 
HCP (or HCP involved). Preferred terms included in that safety topic were “off label use”, 
“intentional device misuse”, “intentional overdose”, and “intentional product misuse”.

Preventability 
Eylea is being studied in many conditions for which off-label use might be considered. 
Off-label ophthalmic use has been reported with currently marketed VEGF inhibitors, e.g., for 
bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD (265) or DME (266, 267). Off-label use of 
ranibizumab has been reported for ophthalmic diseases other than wet AMD such as DME 
(268) or retinal vein occlusion (269) before market authorization was granted in the respective 
indications. There are also reports on off-label use of bevacizumab and ranibizumab in rarer 
diseases such as myopic CNV (in countries where myopic CNV is not labelled), or 
retinopathy of prematurity (268), reviewed in Andreoli and Miller (270). In general, as for the 
majority of possible indications for anti-VEGF therapy approved medications are available, 
the potential for off-label use is considered minimal. Additionally, non-approved indications 
are currently being investigated in various studies to establish safety and efficacy in these 
therapeutic areas. 
Most neovascular and VEGF dependent retina diseases including particularly AMD are 
diseases of the adult. Therefore, the potential for off-label use in the paediatric population is 
expected to be very limited due to the nature of paediatric ophthalmic diseases. However, 
there might be exceptions to be considered, as reviewed in Andreoli and Miller (270). In some 
rare cases, diabetic retinopathy may occur in adolescents. Some ophthalmologists tend to use 
off-label anti-VEGF drugs in this disease instead of the approved therapy. Myopic CNV, 
CRVO, and BRVO may also very rarely occur in adolescents and may be treated off-label 
with any IVT anti-VEGF drug, including Eylea. Eylea may be also used to treat some cases of 
retinopathy of prematurity (271). The number of such cases is considered very low and their 
care is provided by paediatric ophthalmologists who are tertiary care based and experienced in 
the care of these infants. 
Intentional misuse, as such, is difficult to prevent because of the user's deliberate decision to 
deviate from the provided instructions. However, there is no known dependence potential of 
Eylea.

program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). 
This important potential risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of 
Eylea. 
Public health impact 
Not applicable. 
SVII.3.1.8 Potential risk: Embryo-fetotoxicity 
Potential mechanism 
An embryo-foetal toxicity study was performed in the rabbit with IV dosing of aflibercept at 
doses which provided systemic exposures over 670-fold higher than that observed with 
IVT dosing using the clinical dose of 2 mg. The study identified dose-related increases in 
foetal resorptions, pregnancy disruptions and numerous foetal (external, visceral and skeletal) 
malformations. These effects were thought to be due to the antiangiogenic effect of 
aflibercept. For more details see Part II Module SII. 
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence 
Main reason for considering embryo-fetotoxicity as an important potential risk: 
Testing of Eylea in animals was performed as a standard part of the development of Eylea. It 
was noted that Eylea given in extremely high doses to animals (by far exceeding the doses 
which would be given to humans) might have an adverse influence on prenatal development 
(i.e., during the embryonic or foetal development period; so-called embryo-fetotoxicity). 
Therefore, embryo-fetotoxicity is regarded as a potential risk of treatment with Eylea. 
However, Eylea is injected locally and at a dose that is distinctively lower than the exposure 
in animals under which the critical events were observed. So far, there is no relevant 
indication that treatment with Eylea might be associated with embryo-fetotoxicity. 
Evidence sources: refer to the linked subsection.

There were no reports of pregnancies in the Phase II-III clinical studies (wet AMD and DME, 
e.g., CANDELA, PULSAR, PHOTON) for the 8 mg dose of aflibercept. 
Impact on individual patient 
Based on currently available non-clinical data, no individual impact in terms of risk to the 
treated population is apparent. 
Risk factor and risk groups 
Patients at risk are women of childbearing potential. 
Preventability 
Treatment with Eylea is not recommended during pregnancy, unless the potential benefit 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Impact on risk-benefit balance of the product 
An educational program is performed as an additional risk minimization measure to raise 
patients´ and physicians´ awareness on identified and potential risks. The effectiveness of this 
program was verified with a post authorization safety study (SN 16526). 
This important potential risk does not have an impact on the positive risk-benefit balance of

SVII.3.2  Presentation of the Missing Information 
SVII.3.2.1 Long-term safety of aflibercept in preterm infants with ROP 
Evidence source:  
The current knowledge about potential long-term effects of aflibercept IVT treatment in 
preterm infants with ROP is lacking and current safety profile is based on the 6-months 
pivotal study FIREFLEYE.  
Population in need of further characterization: 
A Phase IIIb study FIREFLEYE NEXT is currently performed to evaluate the long-term 
safety in preterm infants until 5 years of age. This extension study has been set-up to evaluate 
the long-term outcomes up to 5 years of chronological age of patients who received treatment 
for ROP in study FIREFLEYE (20090). This study is ongoing and follows up on ocular, 
neurodevelopmental and overall clinical outcomes until 5 years of age when detailed 
assessment of visual function and overall development becomes feasible and stable. 
SVII.3.2.2  Exposure with bilateral 8 mg dose aflibercept therapy 
Evidence source: 
Aflibercept 8 mg studies allowed for concurrent dosing of 8 mg in the study eye and 2 mg 
aflibercept or other anti-VEGFs in the fellow eye. Safety data from patients treated with 8 mg 
in the study eye and 2 mg aflibercept/other anti-VEGFs in the fellow eye did not reveal a new 
safety concern. 
Need for further characterization: 
The safety associated with 8 mg aflibercept bilateral administration will be monitored in the 
PSUR.

Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-up Questionnaires for safety 
concerns 
In order to optimize the data collection for defined medical conditions, specific follow-up 
questionnaires will be used for endophthalmitis/intraocular inflammation, and IOP increases 
with the 2 mg Eylea PFS (see Annex 4). These specific questionnaires will be used to 
follow-up on any post-marketing or study reports causing suspicion of these events in order to 
standardize and increase the completeness of reports.  
The questionnaire for endophthalmitis/intraocular inflammation was updated to include the 
ROP indication and 0.4 mg dose recommended for ROP as well as the 8 mg dosage for the 
wet AMD/DME indications (see updated questionnaire in Annex 4). 
To date, the Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) formulation is only available in a vial format, 
therefore, the questionnaire on IOP increase with the PFS is not planned to be distributed for 
this concentration. It was updated to reflect the ROP indication and the respective dose of 
0.4 mg.

FIREFLEYE NEXT study 20275, an extension study to evaluate the long-term 
outcomes of subjects who received treatment for retinopathy of prematurity in 
the FIREFLEYE Study 20090 (Category 3) 
Study short name and title: 
Study no. BAY 86-5321/20275: Extension study to evaluate the long-term outcomes of 
subjects treated in Study 20090 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The purpose of the current study is to primarily collect the missing data of the potential 
long-term effects after treatment with aflibercept and laser. Subjects will be followed up to 
5 years of chronological age, which will enable a detailed assessment of visual function and 
overall development. 
The primary study objective is to evaluate long-term safety outcomes and visual function of 
subjects included in Study 20090 for treatment for ROP. 
The secondary study objective is to describe the visual function and overall development of 
subjects included in Study 20090 for treatment for ROP. 
Study design:  
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter study to assess the long-term outcomes of subjects previously 
diagnosed with ROP who were treated in Study 20090. No study treatment is defined to be 
administered during this study. The study interventions being assessed were administered in 
Study 20090 (aflibercept and/or laser photocoagulation). Any potential non-study treatments 
are to be decided by the treating physician, according to local standards of care. 
The screening/baseline visit (Visit 1a) of Study 20275 can be conducted concomitantly with 
the Week 24 visit or the last follow-up visit of Study 20090, whichever is later, or at a later 
point between this date and before the subject is 13 months of chronological age. Visit 1b will 
be scheduled when the subject is 40 weeks of chronological age (-7 days / +14 days). 
Additional visits will be scheduled according to the subject’s yearly birthday, with the last

V.2 
Additional Risk Minimization Measures 
Educational program 
V.2.1 
Besides routine risk minimization activities (SmPC and patient information), additional 
activity, specifically an educational program, is considered to be necessary for the important 
identified risks of endophthalmitis (likely infectious origin), intraocular inflammation, 
transient intraocular pressure increase, retinal pigment epithelium tears (adult population), and 
cataract (especially of traumatic origin), as well as for the important potential risk of 
medication errors, off-label use and misuse, embryo-fetotoxicity (adult population), the 
preparation and handling of the Eylea PFS with the paediatric dosing device (ROP 
indication). Generally, the educational material covers the indications wet AMD, CRVO, 
BRVO, myopic CNV, DME and ROP. 
The Educational Material will cover all approved dosages (0.4 mg/2 mg/8 mg) and approved 
formats (2 mg aflibercept PFS, 2/8 mg aflibercept vial) 
Following the assessment (EMEA/H/C/002392/II/0039) of the post authorization study 16526 
(Evaluation of Physician and Patient Knowledge of Safety and Safe Use Information for 
Aflibercept in Europe), the MAH has updated and re-distributed the educational materials 
according to the PRAC Type II variation assessment report received on 08 FEB 2018. The 
updated Educational Material for HCPs include highlighted information regarding treatment 
of women of child-bearing potential, information on the injection procedure with respect to 
unnecessary dilation of the eye, with the need for vision and intraocular pressure evaluation 
after the injection as well as potential for medication misuse, particularly re-use of the vial 
(see EU RMP Part III). The protocol for the follow-up survey (study 20285) was submitted to 
EMA for review on 25 JUN 2018 and approved on 28 FEB 2019. The study was conducted 
between OCT 2019 and APR 2020 and the study results were submitted in OCT 2020. 
 
 
 
EYLEA® 
(Aflibercept) 
EU Risk Management Plan 
Part V – Risk Minimisation Measures 
V.2.1.1.  Objectives and rationale for the additional risk minimization activity 
To inform patients and physicians about risks in order to minimize their occurrence and 
consequences in routine care and to include guidance on the IVT injection procedure using 
the 2 mg Eylea PFS together with the paediatric dosing device to train physicians in order to 
minimize injection-related adverse reactions. 
Educational material also includes guidance on the IVT injection procedure to re-train 
physicians in order to minimize injection-related adverse reactions (adult population). The 
following risks are addressed in the Educational Material: endophthalmitis/intraocular 
inflammation, transient intraocular pressure increase, RPE tear (adult population), cataract, 
medication error, off label use and misuse, and embryo-fetotoxicity (adult population). 
Target audience and planned distribution path 
V.2.1.2. 
The target audience are HCPs specialized in intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents as 
well as patients to be treated. The key messages of the educational materials (provided in 
Part VII Annex 6) will be distributed as paper version and/or through a digital communication 
method (digital platform) to the target audience(s). The feasibility and implementation of the 
planned distribution path will be agreed upon with and after liaising with the national health 
authorities in the EU member states, as requested per GVP Module XVI addendum. 
V.2.1.3. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for 
success 
Based on PRAC recommendations following assessment of the Post-authorization Safety 
Study (PASS) study 16526 (Evaluation of Physician and Patient Knowledge of Safety and 
Safe Use Information for Aflibercept in Europe) a new follow-up survey for physicians with 
revised Educational Material was mandated (see EU RMP Part III). The protocol for the 
follow-up survey was submitted to EMA for review on 25 JUN 2018 and approved on 
28 FEB 2019. The study was conducted between OCT 2019 and APR 2020 and study results 
submitted in OCT 2020. 
The following criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk minimization measures 
were applied: 
•  Proportion of physicians who have received the education materials. 
•  Level of physicians’ knowledge and understanding of the updated educational material 
(i.e., underline information on treatment of women of child-bearing potential, 
information on the injection procedure with respect to unnecessary dilation of the eye, 
vision and intraocular pressure evaluation after injection and on potential medication 
misuse, particularly inadvertent reuse of the vial). 
For the ROP indication, the following criteria for judging the success of the proposed risk 
minimization measures are applied: 
•  Proportion of physicians who have received the educational materials.

PART VI: Summary of Activities in the Risk Management Plan by Product 
This is a summary of the EU risk management plan (RMP) for Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose), 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (0.4 mg dose), and Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose). The RMP details 
important risks of Eylea, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about Eylea's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Eylea’s 40 mg/mL (0.4/2 mg dose) and Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) and their package leaflets give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Eylea should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Eylea should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Eylea’s 
RMP. 
The Medicine and what it is used for 
I 
Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose) is indicated for adults for the treatment of neovascular (wet) 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), visual impairment due to macular edema secondary 
to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO), visual impairment due to diabetic 
macular edema (DME), and visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularization 
(myopic CNV; see SmPC for the full indication).  
Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose) is indicated for the treatment of wet AMD and DME 
(see SmPC for the full indication).  
It contains aflibercept as the active substance and it is given by intravitreal injection. The 
following pharmaceutical forms are currently available: 
•  Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose): Solution for injection in a vial. One vial contains 4 mg 
aflibercept in 100 microliters in iso-osmotic solution. Delivers a single dose of 
2 mg/0.05 mL. 
•  Eylea 40 mg/mL (2 mg dose): Solution for injection in a pre-filled syringe. One 
pre-filled syringe contains 3.6 mg aflibercept in 90 microliters in iso-osmotic solution. 
Delivers a single dose of 2 mg/0.05 mL. 
•  Eylea 114.3 mg/mL (8 mg dose): Solution for injection in a vial. One vial contains 
11.4 mg aflibercept in 100 microlitres in iso-osmotic solution. Delivers a single dose 
of 8 mg/0.07 mL. 
In addition, Eylea 40 mg/mL is indicated in premature infants for the treatment of retinopathy 
of prematurity (ROP). The dosing device PICLEO in combination with the pre-filled syringe 
and a low dead space needle are used for administration of a single dose of 0.4 mg aflibercept 
(equivalent to 0.01 mL solution for injection). 
Further information about the evaluation of Eylea’s benefits can be found in Eylea’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/eylea).

Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
further Characterize the Risks 
Important risks of Eylea together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Eylea's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of Eylea, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Eylea is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of Eylea are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Eylea. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Endophthalmitis (likely infectious origin) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance and literature. 
The intravitreal injection procedure can implant pathogens into the eye if 
there is a break in sterile technique. Source of pathogenic agents is in most 
cases the patient’s conjunctival bacterial flora. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Improper aseptic technique increases the risk of intraocular inflammation.

EU Risk Management Plan 
Part VI – Summary of Activities in the Risk Management Plan by Product 
Important potential risk: Medication errors 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Although 2mg Eylea is provided in a pre-filled syringe, there is an excess 
volume which exceeds the recommended net dose of 2 mg Eylea per 
injection. The drug will be administered only by qualified physicians (not 
by patients), and this reduces the risk of inappropriate dosing and 
administration as well. Proper adherence to the instructions for adequate 
PFS preparation and use minimizes medication errors. 
Risk factors and risk groups

Educational program: Beyond routine minimization activities, additional 
measures are currently needed to raise physicians' awareness on 
medication error (prescriber guide and video; in addition, for adult 
indications patient guide “Your guide to Eylea”, and its audio version). 
Important potential risk: Off-label use and misuse 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
As with other drugs, Eylea might be intentionally used other than 
recommended, or in clinical conditions outside the approved indications 
(so-called off-label use). Since the clinical experience with Eylea in such 
off-label use will be limited (in particular in terms of efficacy and safety), 
any case of off-label use will be considered a potential risk. Since Eylea 
has no dependence potential, the risk of misuse is regarded as very low.

Important potential risk: Embryo-fetotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Data from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance and literature. 
An embryo-foetal toxicity study was performed in the rabbit with IV 
dosing of aflibercept at doses which provided systemic exposures over 
670-fold higher than that observed with IVT dosing using the clinical dose 
of 2 mg. The study identified dose-related increases in foetal resorptions, 
pregnancy disruptions and numerous foetal (external, visceral and skeletal) 
malformations. These effects were thought to be due to the antiangiogenic 
effect of aflibercept. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients at risk are women of childbearing potential.

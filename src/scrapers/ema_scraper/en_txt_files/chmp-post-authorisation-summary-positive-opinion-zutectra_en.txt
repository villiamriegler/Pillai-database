Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Zutectra 
human hepatitis B immunoglobulin 
On 19 November 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Zutectra. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Biotest Pharma GmbH. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows2:  
“Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) re-infection in HBsAg and HBV-DNA negative adult patients at least 
one week 6 months after liver transplantation for hepatitis B induced liver failure.  HBV-DNA negative 
status should be confirmed within the last 3 months prior to OLT. Patients should be HBsAg 
negative before treatment start.  
The concomitant use of adequate virostatic agents should be considered, if appropriate, as standard of 
hepatitis B re-infection prophylaxis.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

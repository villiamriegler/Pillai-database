2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Posaconazole is a broad spectrum triazole antifungal indicated in the systemic treatment of pathogenic 
yeasts and moulds and is currently available as an oral suspension or, recently, as a gastro-resistant 
tablet (Noxafil).  
An intravenous (IV) formulation for high-risk subjects who experience periods of inability to take oral 
medication is considered to be useful in this population. 
In this application, the Applicant is seeking to add an additional dosage form (concentrate for solution for 
infusion) and route of administration (intravenous) of posaconazole. This new presentation is formulated 
as an aqueous injectable solution containing 18 mg/mL of posaconazole for the same indications currently 
approved for the oral suspension (with the exception of treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis) and 
gastro-resistant tablet. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is available as 18 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion of posaconazole as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: betadex sulfobutyl ether, edetate disodium, hydrochloride acid, sodium hydroxide 
and water for injections. 
The product is available in 20 ml glass vial (type I) with bromobutyl Omniflexplus coated rubber stoppers 
and an aluminium flip-off seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active  Substance  
General information 
The active substance used in Noxafil 18 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, is the same active 
substance as the one approved for the currently authorised Noxafil 40 mg/ml Oral suspension. The 
assessment of the active substance was conducted as part of the initial application (EU/1/05/320/001). 
Therefore, Module 3.2.S has not been re-submitted, but confirmation that no changes or updates have 
been made to the ASMF has been provided by the applicant.  
2.2.3.  Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to produce a stable concentrate for solution for 
infusion suitable for intravenous administration. The pharmaceutical development contains Quality by 
Design (QbD) elements, such as risk assessment, PAT models. The quality target product profile (QTPP) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 9/64 
 
 
 
 
and Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) were defined, discussed and considered acceptable. Nevertheless, 
it is important to underline that the applicant did not apply for a design space for the manufacturing 
process of the finished product. 
Early  steps  of  the  formulation  design  were  focussed  on  selection  of  a  solubilising  agent  and  various 
formulations manufactured using various combinations of solutol, PEG, ethanol, sodium edetate, lactic 
acid,  hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin  (HPBCD),  and  betadex  sulfobutyl  ether  at  posaconazole 
concentrations of 5-20 mg/ml. The formulation selected for development was 20 mg/ml posaconazole 
formulated with betadex sulfobutyl ether (400 mg/ml), and sodium edetate (0.1 mg/ml), diluted 10 fold 
with normal saline prior to infusion.   
The solubility of posaconazole at various pH values was evaluated by adding an excess of posaconazole to 
solutions of betadex sulfobutyl. The solubility was highest at pH 2 and the relationship between betadex 
sulfobutyl concentration and posaconazole solubility is non-linear at pH 3 and 4.5. 
The  potential  for  posaconazole  solubility  improvement  using  acidifiers,  co-solvents  and  non-ionic 
surfactants  was  evaluated  using  17  compounds.  Saturation  solubility  data  was  described  and  no 
significant improvement observed with any excipient. Hydrochloric acid was selected as a pH adjuster on 
the basis of its wide use for pharmaceutical products and no co-solvent or surfactant was proposed. 
The final concentrations of posaconazole and betadex sulfobutyl ether were 18 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml 
respectively. A pH value of 2.6 was selected to maintain posaconazole solubility between approximately 
24-34 mg/ml.  
A concentration of 1.0 mg/ml EDTA and nitrogen sparging during manufacture were selected. 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Extensive screening studies were performed to select the appropriate pH, excipients and concentrations 
required  to  solubilize  and  stabilize  the  active  substance  in  the  commercial  formulation.  Multiple 
solubilizers  and  acidifiers were  investigated  prior  to  the  selection  of  the  ones  used  in  the  commercial 
formulation.  The  final  formulation  was  selected  as  having  the  most  suitable  solubility,  stability  and 
compatibility of the excipients with the active substance. A concentration of 1.0 mg/ml EDTA and nitrogen 
sparging during manufacture were selected. 
The formulation, used in the clinical studies is identical to the proposed commercial product. The 
formulation of posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion remains unchanged during the clinical 
development batches and the batches used for Primary Stability Studies (PSS) and the proposed 
commercial presentation.  
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data. This 
container was selected on the basis of compatibility and container-closure integrity studies and is 
adequate for the intended use of the medicinal product.  
Manufacture of the product and process control 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: mixing, filtration, solution acidification, 
pH adjustment, sterilising filtration, aseptic filling, capping and packaging. Satisfactory flow-chart with 
in-process controls of the manufacturing process including tests such as appearance, dissolution of the 
excipients, pH, filter integrity and fill weight have been included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 10/64 
 
 
 
 
 
Depyrogenation of the vials and stoppers is performed in a dry heat tunnel and manufacturing equipment 
is sterilised by steam sterilisation using an autoclave. The vial sterilisation step was adequately validated 
for different temperatures. The filling step stoppering parts are also sterilised by dry heat and the process 
was adequately validated. 
The validation of the manufacturing process was conducted on three consecutive production scale 
batches and by appropriate media fills studies. The quality of the production batches was evaluated 
through the results of in-process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The validation 
protocol was enclosed in the dossier and it was considered satisfactory. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of pharmaceutical form: 
appearance (visual), colour (visual), identification (HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC ), impurities (HPLC), pH 
(Ph Eur), particulate contamination (Ph Eur ),  extractable volume (Ph Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur) 
and sterility (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of 17 batches of different scales of the finished product are provided. The results 
confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with the product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of seven pilot and five commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term 
conditions for thirty six months at 5 ºC ± 3 ºC, up to nine months under accelerated conditions at 25 ºC 
/ 60% RH and up to six months under accelerated conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing 
and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The data demonstrate that the medicinal product is not affected by light. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used, but a statement of compliance with 
the TSE/BSE requirements has been provided by the betadex sulfobutyl ether manufacturer, as this is 
manufactured by fermentation using bovine casein.      
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product for 
this new presentation has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The 
applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product. However, no design 
spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of the finished product.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
None 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application is supported by the non-clinical safety programme conducted for the currently authorised 
Noxafil oral suspension, as well as the safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies 
conducted in support of a previous IV suspension formulation that was discontinued. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Not applicable 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of posaconazole has previously been presented by the Applicant in the initial MA 
dossier. In the new submitted studies, three additional non-clinical studies (a 28-day toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys and two local tolerance studies in rats) in support of the POS IV application were 
submitted in order to determine plasma concentrations for comparison to the POS oral toxicity 
programme. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
There were no single dose toxicity, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies conducted. This is acceptable in 
view of the previously submitted data. 
To demonstrate that no new toxicities occurred with POS IV Solution, two pivotal studies, a 1-month 
study in young adult monkeys and a 3-month study in young adult dogs were conducted. Toxicokinetic 
data were collected to support these studies and determine plasma concentrations for comparison to the 
POS oral toxicity programme.  
A non-dose related low incidence of thrombus/embolus in the lung were observed in the 28-day monkey 
study in animals in the POS IV Solution dose groups. This finding occurred in 1 male and 1 female at 
4mg/kg, 2 males at 8mg/kg and 1female  at 12mg/kg (low-, mid-, and top dose respectively). Although 
this finding was not seen in controls, because of the low incidence in dosed animals and the lack of a dose 
response, the applicant proposed that the presence of a thrombus/embolus in the lung was 
procedure-related. The pulmonary thrombus/embolus were attributed to irritation at the catheter tip and 
subsequent migration of thrombi from the catheter tip to the lungs, a finding consistent with IV infusion 
studies using  surgically-implanted indwelling catheter. Catheter site findings following administration of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 12/64 
 
 
 
 
POS IV Solution via femoral vein catheter with the tip in the inferior vena cava were observed in all groups 
and were consistent with irritation and occurred at a similar frequency and severity across all dose 
groups, including controls, and were considered procedure related.  The fact that the finding was reported 
only in the treated animals indicates the finding could be treatment related. The applicant was requested 
to discuss the mechanism for, and the clinical significance of, the thrombo-embolic events reported in this 
study. An explanation for the occurrence of the thrombo-embolic events reported in the monkey 28-day 
study has been submitted. The data provide some support for the hypothesis that the emboli were caused 
by the occurrence of clots forming at the tip of indwelling catheters, which could migrate and become 
lodged in the lung. However, the CHMP noted some concerns about infusion site reactions and 
thrombophlebitis and the potential for thromboembolic events (see also section 3.6 Clinical Safety). 
Toxicokinetics in this study revealed greater than proportional systemic exposure following repeated 
administration. The applicant was requested to discuss the mechanism and clinical significance of this 
finding. A plausible explanation is that it may be due to a saturation of elimination, as indicated by the 
decreased clearance and accompanying increase in half life with dose. The clinical significance is minimal 
given the dose-proportional increase in exposure in the clinically relevant dose range of 200-300 mg IV.  
POS IV Solution was also evaluated in juvenile dogs. Only one dose (10 mg/kg) was used. The rationale 
for this study design is not clear. The applicant stated that the purpose of this study was to assess the 
safety of a low dose of the test item when administered via the intravenous route during juvenile 
development based on treatment related findings at 60 mg/kg in a previous oral dose study in juvenile 
animals. However, since the dose of the current study was significantly lower due to formulation 
constraints, it was unclear whether these findings would occur. Well-characterized POS toxicities (the 
same as those seen in adult animals) were observed in this study. In addition, enlargement of the lateral 
ventricles in the brain was observed. At the end of the dosing period (main study), dilatation of the lateral 
ventricles of the brain was observed grossly and histologically in 2/4 females and 3/4 males in the 10 
mg/kg POS group. The applicant considered that these changes were most likely treatment related based 
upon the high incidence relative to concurrent or historical control animals and the fact that the change 
was observed in pups from 2 different, genetically unrelated dams.  No difference in the incidence of brain 
ventricle enlargement between control and treated animals was observed following the subsequent 
5-month treatment-free period. There were no neurological or behavioural abnormalities in the dogs with 
this finding. The finding of brain ventricular dilation in juvenile dogs after 6 weeks of POS IV Solution 
administration (where animals were dosed from post-natal Day 14 to postnatal Day 56) is claimed by the 
applicant to cover the period of development equivalent to a human age of 3 months to approximately 
two years of age. These juvenile brain ventricular dilation findings were not observed in adult dogs 
administered POS IV Solution for three months where similar or higher POS exposures were attained 
relative to the juvenile studies. In addition, a suspension formulation of POS (not further developed for 
clinical application) was intravenously administered to young adult rats and young adult monkeys for 
three month durations and was without brain ventricular dilation findings; POS systemic exposures were 
similar or exceeded those achieved in the juvenile dog study testing POS IV solution. The applicant 
hypothesised that observation of brain ventricular dilation following POS IV Solution administration in 
juvenile dogs, but not following POS IV Solution administration in adult dogs and monkeys, or following 
POS IV Suspension administration to adult rats and monkeys, suggests that potential interference to 
brain ventricle development may account for findings in the juvenile dog studies with POS IV Solution. 
Brain ventricular development in humans is understood to be completed well prior to 18 years of age, and 
therefore the applicant considers that this potential risk is not relevant to adults (persons aged 18 years 
or older). In fact, the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, although the fact that the finding was 
reported in one study only provides reassurance. It is also noted that this finding is included in section 5.3 
of the Noxafil SmPC and that the use of posaconazole in patients under 18 years of age is not 
recommended.

The applicant conducted a three-month intravenous infusion toxicity study in dogs (TT #13-1062). This 
study was conducted in compliance with GLP, with the exception that the MRI scans and analysis of drug 
concentrations in cerebral spinal fluid and brain samples were performed using a non-GLP assay. The 
dose level selected was stated to be based on the results from previous studies. However these studies 
were not specified. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential toxicity and toxicokinetic 
profile of Posaconazole, when administered as a daily 15-minute intravenous infusion to dogs for 
approximately 3 months. Four female and 4 male beagle dogs received 9 mg/kg/day of posaconazole 
formulated in a vehicle of 5% Dextrose. The dose was delivered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. The 
dosing volume was 5 mL/kg. A control group of 4 female and 4 male dogs received the vehicle only. Dogs 
were 31 to 35 weeks old at study start. Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical 
observations, body weights, food consumption, gross examination, organ weight of brain, and histological 
examination of the brain. Drug concentrations in the plasma in the treated and control samples were 
determined. In addition, exploratory measurement of drug concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid 
(CSF), and brain samples from all groups were conducted. Exploratory Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) examinations were conducted pre-test, and study weeks 3, 7 and 12-13 on the brain to evaluate 
the brain ventricle volumes. 
All animals survived to scheduled sacrifice. There were no treatment related overt signs of toxicity or 
effects on body weight or food consumption. There were multiple pale foci on the lungs of 7/8 dogs 
treated with posaconazole which were considered likely due to phospholipidosis. Phospholipidosis has 
been observed grossly and histologically in lungs of dogs as a test article-related finding in previous 
pre-clinical studies. There were no test article-related changes in brain weights or histological findings in 
the brain. The ventricles of the brain in treated dogs were similar to control dogs when evaluated by gross 
observation during trimming of the fixed brain and by histomorphology. There were no test article-related 
changes in brain ventricle volumes as determined by MRI. No significant differences in brain ventricle 
volume were seen between groups. 
Systemic exposure to posaconazole was independent of sex. Following repeated administration, systemic 
exposure to posaconazole increased in Study Week 7 compared to Study Day 1. Mean AUC0-24 hr and 
Cmax values in Study Week 7 were approximately 3.1- and 2.2-fold higher than on Study Day 1, 
respectively. 
The main concern in this study was the increase in brain ventricle volume in both the treated and vehicle 
groups. The statistical analysis was not informative. The largest increase was in the vehicle control group 
indicating that the increase is not treatment related.  
Assessment of the local irritation potential of POS IV Solution showed that it was well tolerated and 
behaved similarly to controls. Exposure multiples for the IV solution were similar to those achieved with 
POS oral administration. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed with oral administration of POS to 
support the use of the oral suspension. IV bridging studies in the rat and rabbit demonstrated similar POS 
exposure profiles via oral and IV routes. There was no fertility and early embryonic development, 
embryo-foetal development or pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity studies conducted with POS IV 
Solution.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Based on a Phase I assessment, the Predicted Environment Concentration (PEC) for posaconazole 
exceeded the trigger for requiring an environmental assessment. Therefore a Phase II-Tier A 
environmental effect assessment and concomitant risk assessment was conducted. Based on the log Kow 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015

of 4.15, a further Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) screening was not warranted. 
However, the applicant was requested to clarify the PEC/PNEC ratio used and the maximum daily dose for 
this application. A satisfactory response has been submitted. The transformation products of 
posaconazole are persistent in a water-sediment system. The active ingredient posaconazole is persistent 
in the environment. 
Based on the Phase II–Tier A assessment, posaconazole is unlikely to represent a risk to surface water, 
ground water micro-organisms and sediment dwelling organisms. Posaconazole is not likely to 
bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms and is not a PBT compound (BCF < 2000), indicating little risk to the 
aquatic and sediment environments. The applicant was requested to provide information on the 
recalculated half-lives of the parent and transformation products in sediment. A satisfactory response has 
been submitted. No further action is necessary and no special precautions need to be taken for the 
disposal of posaconazole. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submission of POS IV Solution was supported by the non-clinical programme conducted for the 
already marketed POS Oral Suspension, as well as safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology 
studies conducted in support of POS IV Suspension, a previous IV formulation that was discontinued. 
The objective of the non-clinical toxicology programme for POS IV Solution was to identify any new 
toxicities specific to this IV formulation. Thus, the non-clinical toxicology programme for POS IV Solution 
consisted of two pivotal studies, a completed 1-month study in young adult monkeys and a 3-month 
study in young adult dogs to bridge to the existing non-clinical experience with POS. A study in juvenile 
dogs was also conducted. In addition, two single-dose studies in rabbits (one local tolerance study and 
one IV infusion tolerance study) were conducted to evaluate the irritation potential of this formulation.  
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) which included a number of new studies has also been 
submitted. 
In the 6-week juvenile dog study, in addition to the well characterised POS toxicities, enlargement of the 
lateral ventricles in the brain was observed. There were no neurological or behavioural abnormalities in 
the dogs with this finding. These findings were not observed in adult dogs administered POS IV Solution 
for three months where similar or higher POS exposures were attained relative to the juvenile studies. In 
addition, a suspension formulation of POS (not further developed for clinical application) was 
intravenously administered to young adult rats and young adult monkeys for three month durations and 
was without brain ventricular dilation findings; POS systemic exposures were similar or exceeded those 
achieved in the juvenile dog study testing POS IV solution. The applicant hypothesised that observation of 
brain ventricular dilation following POS IV Solution administration in juvenile dogs, but not in other 
studies, suggests that potential interference to brain ventricle development may account for findings in 
the juvenile dog studies with POS IV Solution. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown, although 
the fact that the finding was reported in only one study provides reassurance. This finding is included in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC and the use of posaconazole in patients under 18 years of age is not 
recommended. 
A non-dose related low incidence of thrombus/embolus in the lung were observed in the 1-month monkey 
study in animals in the POS IV Solution dose groups. Although this finding was not seen in controls, 
because of the low incidence in dosed animals and the lack of a dose response, the applicant proposed 
that the presence of a thrombus/embolus in the lung was procedure-related. The pulmonary 
thrombus/embolus were attributed to irritation at the catheter tip and subsequent migration of thrombi 
from the catheter tip to the lungs, a finding consistent with IV infusion studies using  surgically-implanted 
Assessment report

Page 15/64 
 
 
 
 
indwelling catheter. However, the fact that the finding was reported only in the treated animals indicates 
the finding could be treatment related. The applicant submitted data which  provide some support for the 
hypothesis that the emboli were caused by the occurrence of clots forming at the tip of indwelling 
catheters, which could migrate and become lodged in the lung. However, the CHMP noted some concerns 
about infusion site reactions and thrombophlebitis and the potential for thromboembolic events (see also 
section 3.6 Clinical Safety). 
Assessment of the local irritation potential of POS IV Solution showed that it was well tolerated and 
behaved similarly to controls. Exposure multiples for the IV solution were similar to those achieved with 
POS oral administration. At the clinical IV dose of 300 mg QD, steady state exposure to POS in subjects 
at high risk for invasive fungal infections was similar to or less than the exposure obtained in the 
non-clinical toxicity studies that supported the oral suspension registration and in the toxicity studies with 
the IV solution.  
An ERA revealed that posaconazole is unlikely to be a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data and discussion provided in this submission adequately support this application. 
There are no major objections and all the other concerns have been fully resolved, with some remaining 
concerns about infusion site reactions and the potential for thromboembolic events also discussed and 
assessed in section 3.6 Clinical Safety. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Development rationale  
Noxafil was developed initially as an oral suspension. Posaconazole (POS) oral suspension is very poorly 
soluble in water, has to be administered 2 to 4 times a day and has to be taken with food (preferably a 
high fat meal) or nutritional supplement to ensure adequate exposure among patients. A gastro-resistant 
tablet, with a reduced food effect and providing overall higher exposure than the equivalent dose of POS 
oral suspension, has recently been approved (X-028, CHMP opinion adopted on 20 February 2014). An 
intravenous (IV) formulation for high-risk subjects who experience periods of inability to take oral 
medication is considered useful in this population. The applicant is seeking approval of an IV form of 
posaconazole, a posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion (hereafter referred to as POS IV 
solution), an aqueous injectable solution containing 18 mg/mL of posaconazole for the same indications 
currently approved for the oral suspension (with the exception of treatment for oropharyngeal 
candidiasis). The clinical development program for the POS IV solution was designed to bridge to the prior 
POS oral suspension clinical program. The new IV formulation is an aqueous solution containing the 
solubilizer sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD), which is the same solubilizer used in the IV 
formulation of another azole antifungal, voriconazole.

•  Bridging strategy  
The clinical program for IV POS solution has been designed to demonstrate comparable exposure and 
safety for the intravenous formulation of posaconazole among the same patient populations for which the 
POS oral suspension has already been approved. To this end, the primary intent of the pivotal clinical 
study in patients (P05520) was to fully characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess safety of IV 
POS solution in neutropenic subjects (AML and MDS) and subjects who had undergone a HSCT and were 
under treatment for GVHD.  
The MAH states that a clear dose-response relationship has been identified with higher exposures 
associated with a higher likelihood of clinical response. In general, efficacy for prophylaxis appeared to be 
greater in POS-treated subjects than in control subjects when POS exposures were in the second or higher 
quartiles. This effect was seen not only in the pivotal Phase 3 prophylaxis studies (P 01899 and C/I98- 
316) but also in patients with aspergillosis enrolled in the refractory IFI study (P00041)  
POS Oral Suspension Exposure Response Analysis In Key Clinical Treatment and Prophylaxis Trials. 
Table 1. 
The plasma concentrations achieved in the 2 prior prophylaxis trials with POS oral suspension at the 
approved clinical dose have been used by the applicant as a predictor of overall prophylaxis efficacy, and 
these 2 studies provide the basis for the target therapeutic exposure in the bridging study. In study 
P01899, the mean POS plasma concentration following POS oral suspension was 583 ng/mL, with 90% of 
patients attaining POS average plasma levels (Cavg) greater than or equal to 228 ng/mL. In study 
C/I98-316, the mean POS plasma concentration following POS oral suspension was 1130 ng/mL with 90% 
attaining POS plasma Cavg greater than or equal to 322 ng/mL. 
Further, in study P000041 (treatment of IFI), in the lowest quartile exposure was only 134 ng/mL with a 
corresponding clinical response to therapy of 24%, and patients in the 4th quartile, who had a 
steady-state Cavg mean value of 1250 ng/mL, had a 71% response rate at EOT. The Cavg of 1250 ng/mL 
translates to a steady-state area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 24 
hours (AUC[0-24 hr]) of approximately 30,000 ng*hr/mL. Based on this, a Cavg value of approximately 
1200 ng/mL was selected as the target exposure for IV POS solution. 
The primary intent of the pivotal clinical study in high-risk subjects (P05520) was to fully characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and assess safety of POS IV solution in neutropenic subjects (AML and MDS) and

subjects who had undergone an HSCT and were under treatment for GvHD. This Phase 1b/3 study was 
designed as the bridging study to the prior POS oral suspension clinical program. An exposure range for 
POS IV solution was targeted that had been previously shown to be efficacious and safe with the POS oral 
suspension clinical development program in the prophylaxis and salvage treatment setting.  
The exposure target range for the use of POS IV solution in subjects was set as below: 
Mean steady-state Cavg of around 1,200 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 28,800 ng.hr/mL) with at least 90% of 
the subjects between 500 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 12,000 ng.hr/mL) and 2,500 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 
60,000 ng.hr/mL); and 
• No subject with mean Cavg at steady-state above 3,650 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] above 87,600 ng.hr/mL); 
and 
• No subject with mean Cavg at steady-state below 200 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] below 4,800 ng.hr/mL). 
Cavg was the exposure parameter used in studies with POS oral suspension and therefore this was the 
major bridging PK parameter. In addition to the Cavg as the major bridging parameter, the Cmin is taken 
into account and evaluated against the Cavg requirements. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Earlier studies have characterized the pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicologic profile of POS oral 
suspension. POS oral suspension is slowly absorbed, extensively distributed into the tissues, and slowly 
eliminated, without any major circulating metabolites. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are 
glucuronic acid conjugates of POS with only low levels of oxidative metabolites. Exposure of POS oral 
suspension can be increased by dividing the POS 800 mg/day dose to BID or QID and administering the 
dose with food. The pharmacokinetics of POS oral suspension are not significantly altered in subjects with 
hepatic or renal dysfunction or in subjects who differ by age, race, gender or weight. POS is an inhibitor 
of CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. The clinical development program for POS IV solution was 
designed to bridge to the prior POS oral suspension clinical program. 
•  Analytical Methods 
The analytical methods used for quantification of POS in human plasma were validated for specificity, 
sensitivity, and reproducibility. The bioanalytical methods utilized were based on a solid phase extraction 
of the analytes from the biological matrix followed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem 
mass spectrometric detection (MS/MS). 
2.4.2.1.  Individual Clinical Pharmacology Studies 
There are three (3) healthy volunteer studies and one (1) study in high risk subjects with POS concentrate 
for solution for infusion.

•  Studies in healthy volunteers 
Study P04975 
Study P04985 was a randomized, open label, placebo-controlled, rising single and multiple dose, single 
site phase 1 study. Approximately 24 healthy male and female adult subjects (between 18 and 65 years 
of age) with a BMI of 19 to 35 were planned to be enrolled in two cohorts. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the PK of POS IV solution when administered as single and multiple 
doses via peripheral infusion over ninety (90) minutes in healthy volunteers. 
In Cohort 1, 12 subjects were to be randomized to receive POS IV Solution 200 mg QD/BID (Treatment 
A) or placebo (9 active/3 placebo). It was planned that 12 different subjects in Cohort 2 would receive 
POS IV Solution 400 mg QD/BID (Treatment B) or placebo (9 active/3 placebo) followed later by further 
doses of oral POS. However, the study was terminated early due to local peripheral venous intolerance 
reactions observed following single-dose infusion of POS IV 200 mg in Cohort 1, Treatment A. Further 
treatments were not administered.

Mean (±SD) POS Plasma Concentration-Time Profiles Following Single Dose Administration of 
200 mg POS IV Solution to Healthy Adult Volunteers (P04985) 
  After single dose infusion of 200 mg POS IV solution, infused over 90 minutes, a mean Cmax of 
1470 ng/mL (CV%=24%) was attained at a median Tmax of 1 hour.  
  The mean AUCinf was 28100 ng·hr·mL-1 (CV%=26%). The mean systemic clearance (CL) of POS 
was 7.46 L/hr (CV%=20%) and the mean half-life was 24 hours. 
Study P06356 
This was a randomized, 2-part, third-party blind, placebo-controlled, rising single and multiple dose 
study, performed at a single site to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
posaconazole IV solution in healthy male and female volunteers 18 to 65 years of age. 
After overnight fasting, a total of 72 subjects were randomized in 1 of the 6 cohorts of 12 subjects each 
(9 active and 3 placebo) and received a peripheral IV solution with vehicle IV solution (without 
posaconazole, Cohort 1 only) or posaconazole IV solution (Cohorts 2 - 6) or placebo (D5W). The dosing 
range of posaconazole was 0 (vehicle IV solution only), 50, 100, 200, 250, and 300 mg. In each subgroup, 
3 subjects received the vehicle IV solution (Cohort 1 only) or posaconazole IV solution (Cohorts 2 - 6) and 
1 subject received the placebo (D5W). 
In part 2, a total of 48 subjects were to be randomised to receive multiple doses of IV POS (ranging from 
100- 300mg) or placebo. Due to cases of thrombophlebitis in Part 2, the multiple-dose component of this 
study was discontinued and the single-dose component of the study was amended to test the 250 mg and 
300 mg dose levels, instead of the 300 mg and 400 mg dose levels. In addition, to minimize the risk of

thrombophlebitis, it was determined that after completion of the 30-minute SD infusion, the infusion site 
should be immediately flushed with 20 mL of 5% dextrose for injection (D5W) by IV push.

  The mean systemic clearance (CL) of POS was lower at doses equal to and above 200 mg (range: 
6.54 - 6.90 L/hr) as compared to the lower doses (range: 9.40 - 10.9 L/h). 
  Variability following POS IV solution infusion was moderate with CV% range of 26-30% and 
26-50% for Cmax and AUCinf, respectively. 
  A more than dose proportional increase in Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-∞ occurs following POS IV 
solution infusion. This more than dose proportional increase mainly occurs at doses between 50 
and 200 mg and less at the more clinically relevant doses from 200 - 300 mg. 
Study P07783 (Part 1) 
This study was an open label, two-part, single and multiple-dose study in healthy volunteer subjects. Part 
1 of the study was designed to estimate the absolute bioavailability of the investigational tablet compared 
to POS intravenous (IV) solution via peripheral infusion following a single dose administration of 300 mg 
for both formulations. 
Part 2 of the study was designed to estimate the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) of POS tablet D 
following 8 days of daily administration of 300 mg and is not discussed.  
Mean AUC0-last and AUC0-∞ for the POS tablet (tablet D) (22722 and 23647 hr*ng/mL, respectively) 
were approximately 2-fold smaller compared to the POS IV solution (42905 and 44380 hr*ng/mL, 
respectively). The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) following the POS tablet administration 
was approximately 7- fold lower than Cmax after POS IV solution administration. Cmax was reached at a 
median of 5 hours for the tablet and at the end of infusion (0.5 hours) for the IV solution. The variability 
in Cmax and AUCs was consistently higher following POS tablet administration (CV 38% to 48%, 
respectively) than following POS IV solution administration (CV 19% to 32%, respectively). 
The mean elimination half-life was similar (between 28 and 29 hours) for the two formulations. The 
(apparent) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were both approximately twice as high for the 
POS tablet than for the POS IV solution.

•  Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study P05520 
Study design 
Study P05520 was an open-label, sequential and parallel-group, multi-site study POS IV Solution used as 
prophylaxis in subjects at high risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The study consisted of 4 
sequentially-performed cohorts in Phase 1b (Cohorts 0, 1, and 2) and Phase 3 (Cohort 3). Overall, the 
study enrolled 279 high risk subjects, including 268 receiving at least 1 dose of POS IV solution. In all 
subjects, POS IV solution was administered via a central line as a 90-minute infusion. 
Cohort 0 
Subjects were randomized to receive either a single dose of POS IV solution or a single IV dose of placebo 
(5% dextrose in water [D5W]) administered via a central line as a 90-minute infusion. This was followed 
after approximately 12 h by POS oral suspension at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (BID) and subsequently 
for 11 additional doses of POS oral suspension given BID (6 days in total).  
Cohorts 1 and 2:  
In Cohort 1, subjects received IV POS solution at 200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg once daily 
(QD) for another 13 days. In Cohort 2, subjects received IV POS solution at 300 mg BID on Day 1, 
followed by 300 mg QD for another 13 days. Thereafter, in both groups, subjects received POS oral 
suspension from Day 15 to Day 28 at a dose of 400 g BID.  
PK Target for Final Dose Selection 
The primary PK parameter of interest in this study was the plasma POS exposure at steady state (Cavg, 
or AUC[0-24] divided by 24 hours). A dose was to be selected for Cohort 3 based on the following criteria 
in the serial PK-evaluable cohorts from Cohorts 1 and 2: 
• Mean steady-state Cavg of around 1,200 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 28,800 ng.hr/mL) with at least 90% 
of the subjects within 2,500 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 60,000 ng.hr/mL) and 500 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] of 
12,000 ng.hr/mL). 
• No subject with mean Cavg at steady-state above 3,650 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24]above 87,600 ng.hr/mL). 
• No subject with mean Cavg at steady-state below 200 ng/mL (or AUC[0-24] below 4,800 ng.hr/mL). 
The desired exposure targets at steady state needed to be met in Cohorts 1 or 2 to allow for dose selection 
for Cohort 3. 
Cohort 3:  
Subsequently, in Cohort 3, POS IV solution was given for at least 5 days (300 mg BID on Day 1, followed 
by 300 mg qD) followed by POS oral suspension to complete 28 days of treatment. After IV therapy was 
completed, subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg POS orally TID or 400 mg POS orally BID.  
On Day 6, if the subject was able to tolerate oral medication, the subject had the option to begin 
treatment with a POS oral suspension dosing regimen as per randomized treatment assignment which 
was to be continued for up to 23 more days (28 days total treatment). The investigator may have 
switched the subject back to POS IV solution if the subject was unable to tolerate oral suspension. If the 
investigator felt that the subject would NOT be able to tolerate oral dosing on Day 6, the subject would 
continue on POS IV solution therapy until he/she was able to tolerate oral medications.

Cohort 3 Subjects with Expanded PK Sampling 
Approximately 40 Cohort 3 subjects at selected sites received a minimum of 10 days of therapy with POS 
IV solution. On Day 11, the subject was switched to oral medication if possible and treatment continued 
as described above for cohort 3 patients. 
There were two PK populations:  
• 
• 
the Serial PK-Evaluable Population, for which full PK profiles were evaluated and  
the Cmin PK-Evaluable Population, for which only Cmin was evaluated.

oral suspension are shown below. Variability is high, especially after POS oral suspension dosing. The 
Cmin values of subjects on maintenance dosing of POS oral suspension at 400 mg BID decreased 
approximately 30% as compared to the steady state exposure at 200 mg POS IV solution.

The PK data have been combined across the 2 cohorts (Cohort 2 and 3) for subjects included in the serial 
PK-evaluable cohorts. A total of 237 subjects were enrolled in Cohort 2 and 3. Of these 237 subjects, 49 
were included in the serial PK-evaluable cohort.

Based upon steady-state data from the 49 serial PK-evaluable subjects five subjects (10%) attained 
steady state Cmin values below 500 ng/mL. Forty-four (90%) subjects attained steady state Cmin values 
between 500 and 2500 ng/mL. No subject’s Cmin value was above 2500 ng/mL.

Cmin PK evaluable Population 
In Cohort 2, subjects received 300 mg POS IV solution for 14 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 
POS oral suspension at 400 mg BID for an additional 14 days (through Day 28). 
The mean Cmin values attained at Days 3, 6, 12 and 13 on IV solution and at Days 16, 19 and 25 on POS 
oral suspension showed high variability for the later days and especially after POS oral suspension dosing. 
Despite this increased variability it is evident that trough plasma levels decrease significantly upon 
maintenance dosing with POS oral suspension (400mg BD). 
In Cohort 3, all subjects were treated for a minimum of 5 days of POS IV solution. Thereafter, subjects 
were randomized to receive POS oral suspension either as 200 mg TID or 400 mg BID. Cmin values were 
collected from subjects on several days while on POS IV solution as well as during step down therapy to 
POS oral suspension. Variability in Cmin values was high (up to 50% for POS IV solution and higher for 
POS oral suspension).  
In addition, the stepdown effect to oral therapy in Cohort 3 was randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive POS 
oral suspension at either 200 mg TID (three times a day dosing; current recommended dose for 
prophylaxis) or 400 mg BID (twice a day dosing; current alternate dosing for treatment of IFIs). POS 
plasma levels decrease (up to 50%) after transitioning from POS IV solution to POS oral suspension, 
regardless of the dose regimen of POS oral suspension. However, the POS exposure was slightly higher 
when the sequential dose regimen of POS oral suspension was 200 mg TID.

Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies  
The clinical pharmacokinetics of POS IV solution is described based on two pooled analyses: 
1) composite pharmacokinetic analysis 
2) population PK model. 
Composite pharmacokinetic analysis 
Multiple dose PK in patients 
The total variability of steady state pharmacokinetics in patient population was moderate to high with 
CV% of 39.7% for AUC0-24hr and 44.9% for Cmax, which was slightly higher than the variability in 
healthy subjects. The effect of age was consistent with effects seen in healthy volunteers. Compared to 
200 mg, the dose normalized Cmax and AUC0-24hr were 11.6% and 18.8% lower for 300 mg, which is 
not statistically significant. There is a slightly lower Cavg and AUC0-24hr in AML patients compared to 
BMT patients that is not statistically significant. However, Cmax is statistically significant lower (25.8%) 
for AML compared to BMT. 
Cmax is 45.9% higher for Females compared to Males, and Cavg is 22.5% higher for Females compared 
to Males. There was a statistically non-significant negative relationship between weight and Cmax, Cavg, 
and AUC0-24hr. For every 10 kg increase in weight, AUC0-24hr would be expected to decrease by 1.8% and 
Cmax would be expected to decrease by 5.8%. 
The weight effect on PK becomes clearer in the sensitivity analysis (Effect of Weight without Gender in the 
Model) compared to the original model, with a statistically significant relationship between weight and 
Cmax. For every 10 kg increase in weight, AUC0-24hr would be expected to decrease by 4.2% and Cmax 
would be expected to decrease by 10.0%. This indicates that gender may at least partly account for an 
effect of weight on exposure in patients.

Population PK model 
The population PK model was developed on the basis of data from studies in healthy volunteers and high 
risk subjects in which intensive and sparse sampling was applied (overall dose range 50-300 mg in 
healthy volunteers, 200-300 mg in high risk subjects). 
Primary objectives: 
To develop a population PK model of POS IV solution using data in healthy volunteers and high risk 
subjects and quantify the variability of the PK of POS. 
To perform a covariate analysis to identify the demographic and clinical factors that might affect POS 
exposure. 
To translate the PK results from the study in high risk subjects (49 PK evaluable subjects in P05520) to a 
broader population by conducting simulations for a dose regimen of 300 mg QD after BID dosing on Day 
1 and an infusion duration of 90 minutes 
In total, 306 subjects (67 healthy volunteers and 239 high risk subjects) and 2322 plasma samples were 
available for the analysis. Covariates tested for their potential impact on pharmacokinetic parameters or 
model components were disease state (healthy volunteer (67), patient AML/MDS (166), and patient HSCT 
(73)), weight, gender, dose, and age. 
Methods 
The analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling methodology as implemented in 
NONMEM. First, a base model was developed, including a model for the random effects. Then a covariate 
analysis was added with forward addition and backward elimination of the non-significant covariates. The 
final model was checked for residual error model structure and outlier evaluation and then the model was 
validated using visual predictive check and bootstrap. In addition the derived parameters (Cmax, AUC, 
Cavg, Cmin) were calculated from the model predicted data and compared with those of the observed 
data. 
Results 
The data were best described by a 2-compartmental model with first order elimination. Covariate analysis 
showed 3 statistically significant covariates, weight on peripheral volume of distribution and disease 
status (healthy volunteers  vs. patients) on both central and peripheral volume of distribution. 
Variability was estimated for volumes, clearance and intercompartmental flow (52%, 22%, 44% and 50% 
for Vc, Vp, CL, and Q respectively).

Final parameter estimates 
Simulated PK parameters 
The final PK model is able to simulate PK parameters in high risk subjects comparable to the observed 
ones following administration of POS IV solution. Model qualification showed that the model was adequate 
and robust and could be used for simulation purposes and calculation of the relevant exposure 
parameters (AUCτ, Cavg, Cmin). Model derived Cavg and Cmin were compared against observed values 
in order to evaluate the performance of the model for the target population.

Simulated plasma concentrations 
Simulations were performed on the basis of the established population pharmacokinetic model, using a 
virtual population obtained through resampling of subject demographics from five patient studies from 
the POS program (oral suspension, investigational oral tablet and IV solution) ((P05615, P01899, 
C/I98-316, P00041, P05520). 
The simulation dataset included 1000 subjects and the significant covariate (weight) identified during 
model development was included in the dataset by external database resampling. The simulations 
included inter-individual variability and intra-individual variability (IOV) estimated in the final PK model. 
On Day 5, 10 or 13 (last day of dosing), a full PK profile was simulated for 1000 high risk subjects in order 
to calculate the individual exposure parameters AUC, Cavg, Cmin.  
Simulations with high and low weight subjects did not show any difference in simulations and distributions 
on Cavg and Cmin. Simulation of high risk subjects (both AML/MDS as well as HSCT) for up to 13 days of 
dosing showed that:

•  99.7% and 93.6% of the high risk subjects have a Cavg and Cmin above 500 ng/mL, respectively  
•  84.6% of the high risk subjects have a Cavg between 500 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL;  
•  15% of Cavg were above 2500 ng/mL, with 2.9% above 3,650 ng/mL 
The simulations for the 5 days of dosing showed that 99.7% and 93.3% of the high risk subjects have a 
Cavg and Cmin above 500 ng/mL, respectively. In addition, 94.9% of the high risk subjects have a Cavg 
between 500 ng/mL and 2500 ng/mL; the remaining Cavg were generally above 2500 ng/mL but most 
remained below 3,650 ng/mL (0.1% was above 3,650 ng/mL.  
Figure 7. 
Distribution of Simulated Cavg using the Weight Distribution based on all High Risk Subjects 
Treated with Posaconazole IV Solution after 13 days 
The MAH concludes that the simulations indicate that a low percentage of the subjects may have Cavg 
exposures above 3650 ng/mL, but because there is no relationship between occurrence of (S)AE’s or any 
other safety findings and POS exposure, this is considered not clinically relevant. 
Thus, the simulations from the population PK model support the proposed marketed dose for POS IV 
solution for all subjects at high risk for obtaining IFIs.

Weight-based dosing of 4 mg/kg does not reduce the percentage of subjects with Cavg above 3650

similar to those seen with the 300 mg QD dose.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bridging strategy  
The bridging strategy had been accepted by CHMP in a scientific advice procedure and the exposure 
targets had been discussed. Similar (although not identical) PK targets have been used in the recently 
concluded application for posaconazole gastro-resistant tablets (X-028). 
Exposure-response analysis from the pivotal trials for the oral suspension indicated an association 
between lower plasma concentrations and clinical failure. From the data provided from the prophylaxis 
trials, it appears that exposure in the lowest quartile was associated with poorer outcome, although low 
case numbers are a limiting factor. Equally, in the treatment of IFI, POS plasma concentrations presented 
from one trial tended to be higher in cases of clinical success, but the plasma concentration range was 
wide. Limited non-clinical data provide some additional support. The exposure target was to be within the 
ranges previously studied and demonstrated to be safe and effective. The strategy, which has been 
applied for the recently approved tablet formulation, is acceptable. 
The bridging data as discussed at CHMP were based on Cavg, however this parameter is based on the AUC 
and will include what could be a significant proportion of the AUC in the initial distribution phase. The 
applicant recognised this and also included target attainment percentages based on Cmin data for the 
proposed regimen which is considered a more conservative parameter. The maximum plasma 
concentrations will be different following IV dosing and Cmax are discussed at the projected clinical dose 
in terms of safety (see section 2.6 below).

Cyclodextrin solubilizer 
Posaconazole is a lipophilic drug and is difficult to formulate for intravenous administration. To improve 
aqueous solubitity, posaconazole IV solution contains the solubilizer Captisol (cyclodextrin, SBEβCD) 
which is also used in the IV formulation of another azole antifungal, voriconazole, at similar 
concentrations. The pH of the admixture solution is dependent on the posaconazole IV dose and typically 
ranges from 3.2 to 3.6. In the responses, the applicant provided data demonstrating that posaconazole is 
rapidly and quantitatively released from cyclodextrin after injection. The amount of cyclodextrin 
administered with IV POS is similar to the amounts administered with intravenous voriconazole, at least 
for patients weighing > 60kg, which represents the majority of patients. This appears acceptable as it is 
expected that IV POS will be administered over relatively short periods of time and provided the product 
information includes a comment of caution for use in patients weighing less than 60kg. Because of 
accumulation in patients with renal impairment, cyclodextrin containing products are not generally 
suitable in this population and this should be clearly stated in the SmPC.  
Phase I study programme 
POS IV solution is intended for administration via a central line as local infusion-site reactions were 
identified in non-clinical studies and confirmed in clinical study in healthy volunteers. Nevertheless, POS 
IV solution was administered via peripheral infusion in all healthy volunteer studies. Despite a change in 
administration time (reduced from 90 to 30 minutes), both multiple dose studies (P04985 and P06356) 
had to be terminated prematurely due to local safety and tolerability problems with the IV solution. 
Consequently the healthy volunteers data consist of single dose data only, which is a significant limitation 
as accumulation has been demonstrated for POS oral suspension.  
POS is distributed to extravascular compartments and slowly eliminated after administration of single 
doses of the IV solution, similarly to the oral suspension. Tmax is reached around the time of termination 
of infusion. AUCinf was comparable for POS IV solution and POS oral suspension (when taken with a high 
fat meal) at the 100 mg dose level, but approximately 3 times higher as compared to the POS oral 
suspension in the fasted state. Cmax is approximately 5-7 times higher for the POS IV solution compared 
to the oral suspension. T1/2 after a single dose of 100 mg was comparable to POS oral suspension (fed) 
(20 and 25 hours, respectively). Single dose data indicate a more than proportional increase of Cmax and 
AUC in the lower dose range (< 200mg). AUC increases approximately dose proportionally between doses 
of 200mg and 300mg, while Cmax seems to increase less than proportionally. The difference in CL at 
higher doses may be due to saturation of elimination of POS, and in this case may be a factor in the 
apparent non-linearity of the PK. POS oral suspension reportedly shows linear kinetics following single- 
and multiple-dose administration up to 800 mg. 
Posaconazole administered as an oral suspension was shown to accumulate more than expected after 
multiple doses, an effect thought to be at least in part due to the difference in food intake over time. 
Multiple dose PK data are not available for IV POS in healthy volunteers.  
Accumulation was also seen with the oral gastro-resistant tablet formulation of posaconazole recently 
evaluated in another line extension procedure (X-028). 
The phase I programme is significantly affected by the lack of multiple dose data, in particular as time 
dependency is described for oral posaconazole formulation.  
PK in target population 
The patient population appears representative of the majority of patients who are at risk of developing 
IFIs. The population selected for this cohort was the same for which POS oral suspension is approved in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 38/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the prevention of IFIs. The study population is representative of the population expected to use POS for 
prophylaxis of IFIs. In their responses, the applicant provided data to suggest that exposure in the 
treatment population may be expected to be similar to that in the prophylaxis population, thus supporting 
the applicability of the data generated for the population with actual IFI. This addresses the Major 
Objection raised during the initial assessment. 
Single dose PK are difficult to compare  to healthy volunteers due to the different time intervals, but 
exposures appear to be lower in patients and certainly Cmax is lower, as seen with the oral suspension. 
Regardless of formulation, posaconazole demonstrates greater than expected accumulation after multiple 
dosing, which is likely due to reduced clearance.  Accumulation with the intravenous solutions appears 
less than with the oral formulations, possibly due to the elimination of the food effect. Data may be 
affected by the proportion of patients not dosed to steady state with the intravenous formulation.  
Data suggested that there may be time-dependency in the PK of posaconazole, however further 
exploration did not confirm this based on the available data. The variability in exposure (AUC/Cavg) for IV 
POS was around 50%. The PK of oral posaconazole differ between patients and healthy volunteers and 
even between patient groups depending on the underlying condition. After multiple IV posaconazole 
doses in patients, there was no significant difference between patients with AML/MDS and HSCT in 
exposure, providing support for the assumption that bioavailability and effect of food is the main cause of 
the observed difference with the oral formulation. 
Dose finding 
The observed data (serial PK evaluable patients) for both the 200mg and 300mg dose show that the 
predefined exposure target was met for Cavg (94% of patients had Cavg between 500- 2500ng/ml for 
both dose levels) and exposure after IV POS solution was higher than seen after the oral suspension. The 
simulated data show that a higher proportion of subjects meet the exposure target with the 200mg dose, 
primarily due to the fact that a higher proportion of patients will have exposures between 2500 and 
3650ng/ml with the 300mg dose. The applicant proposes the 300mg dose based on the significantly 
higher number of patients expected to have a Cmin < 500ng/ml with the 200mg dose (35% versus 12%), 
although Cmin was not the primary bridging parameter.   
The simulated data at the 300mg dose level indicate that around 15% of patients will have exposures 
exceeding the upper exposure target of 2500 ng/ml after 13 days of treatment, with around 3% 
exceeding the upper threshold of 3650ng/ml. Reported exposures resulting from the 300mg intravenous 
solution were very similar to those resulting from the 300mg tablet, which was recently approved.  
While Cmin was not the primary bridging parameter, it is agreed to be a more conservative target in terms 
of improved efficacy and, taking the lack of demonstrated increase in adverse events into account, the 
300mg dose is considered acceptable. The on-going comparative study with posaconazole intravenous 
solution and the tablet formulation (PN 069) will generate additional PK, efficacy and safety data and if 
necessary the question of the most appropriate dose will be revisited in the light of the emerging data. 
Composite PK analysis and population PK indicate that gender and weight may affect exposure to IV POS, 
but weight adjusted dosing did not relevantly affect the proportion of subjects meeting the exposure 
target. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In summary, single dose PK in healthy volunteers and single and multiple dose PK in patients for IV POS 
solution have been described. A population PK model was developed to further characterise PK 
Assessment report

parameters and relevant co-variates. The characterization of the pharmacokinetics of IV POS solution is 
generally satisfactory. Composite PK analysis and population PK indicate that gender and weight may 
affect exposure to IV POS solution. IV POS solution in a dose of 200mg and 300mg will lead to higher 
plasma concentrations than POS oral suspension. The 300mg dose IV is expected to result in exposures 
similar to those of the 300mg tablet. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
There was no clinical study with efficacy as the primary endpoint in this application.  
2.5.1.  Main study 
P05520 : Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Intravenous Posaconazole Solution followed by 
Oral Posaconazole Suspension in Subjects at High Risk for Invasive Fungal Infections. 
Methods 
Study P05520 was an open-label, sequential- and parallel-group, multi-site study POS IV Solution used as 
prophylaxis in subjects at high risk for invasive fungal infections (IFIs). The study consisted of 4 
sequentially-performed cohorts in Phase 1b (Cohorts 0, 1, and 2) and Phase 3 (Cohort 3).  
In all subjects, POS IV solution was administered via a central line as a 90-minute infusion. 
Study Participants  
Subjects with expected neutropenia due to chemotherapy for AML, MDS, or secondary leukemias (cohorts 
0,1,2), and in addition recipients of allogeneic HSCT (cohort 3 only) were selected to participate in the 
trial.  Subjects had to be anticipated (likely to develop within 3 days to 5 days) or documented prolonged 
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/mm3 [0.5 x 109/L]) at Baseline and likely to last for 
at least 7 days. Subjects were required to have a central line catheter in place. Subjects could have 
received a single infusion via a peripheral line if a central line catheter was not available. 
Treatments 
Treatment duration/ exposure: 
Cohort 0: POS 200 mg IV or placebo, single dose, followed by POS oral suspension 400mg BD for of 6 days 
Cohort 1: POS 200 mg IV, (200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg qD for another 13 days), followed 
by POS oral suspension 400mg BD for 14 days 
Cohort 2: POS 200 mg IV, (200 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 200 mg qD for another 13 days), followed 
by 200 mg qD for another 13 days), n=21, followed by POS oral suspension 400mg BD for 14 days 
Cohort 3: POS 300 mg IV, (300 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 300 mg qD for at least 4 days), followed by 
POS oral suspension 200mg TID or 400mg BD for a total of 28 days 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There were no primary efficacy endpoints in any of the cohorts. For Cohort 3, the following endpoints were 
to be summarized using descriptive statistics for all subjects combined and by underlying disease:

1)  Clinical failure during the exposure phase as determined by incidence of IFIs as diagnosed by the 
investigator, deaths up to Day 70, discontinuations for any reasons, or use of systemic 
antifungals for empiric treatment of fungal infections for more than 4 days; (Of note, the protocol 
allowed subjects to receive an IV amphotericin B formulation or an echinocandin as empirical 
treatment for up to 4 days for possible fungal infections and remain on study therapy 
2)  Survival Assessment at Day 60 (at any day from Days 60 to 70). 
Safety assessments 
For cohort 1 and 2, Safety assessments were collected at Baseline, Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 3, Day 7, Day 
14 or EOT (end of the IV Treatment Phase), Week 3,Week 4 or EOT (end of the Oral Treatment Phase), 
and Follow-up (7 days after last dose of study drug). Similar timelines were followed for cohort 0. 
Safety assessments for cohort 3 (hematologic studies and serum chemistries) were collected at Baseline, 
Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 3, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10 (±2 days ), Day 15 (±3 days ), Day 22 (±3 days ), Day 
28 or EOT, and Follow-up (7 days after last dose of study drug).  
Sample size 
Overall, the study enrolled 279 high risk subjects, including 268 receiving at least 1 dose of POS IV 
solution. 
The overall sample size selected for this study was based on PK considerations. 
Results 
For the purpose of efficacy assessment, the two 300 mg dose cohorts (Cohort 2 and 3) have been 
combined. 
Among the 21 subjects in the POS IV solution 200 mg multiple dose group (Cohort 1), there were 7 
subjects (33%) who developed clinical failure.  One (1/21) (5%) subject had a proven (fatal) IFI 
diagnosed during the period of the study. 
Among the 237 subjects in the POS 300 mg multiple dose group (Cohort 2 and 3 combined), there were 
75 subjects (32%) who developed clinical failure; in most cases this was due to discontinuation of study 
therapy for reasons other than treatment failure. Three (3) (<1%) subjects was reported as having a 
proven or probable IFI and 3 (1%) subjects received systemic antifungals for empiric treatment of fungal 
infections. Overall, the incidence of IFI in the pivotal study of POS IV solution, P05520, was low and 
similar to that previously reported for POS oral suspension in P01899 and C/I98-316. 
It is particularly noteworthy to examine the incidence of proven/probable IFI and the requirement of 
empirical antifungal treatment, as these two components of the clinical failure endpoint can be viewed as 
focusing specifically on “true” treatment failures related to ineffective antifungal prophylaxis. 
There were no (0%) IFIs reported in Cohort 0. In the 200 mg multiple dose group (Cohort 1), there was 
one subject (5%) with a reported proven or probable IFI. In the 300 mg dose group (Cohorts 2 and 3 
combined), there were three subjects (1%) with a reported proven or probable IFI. 
No subjects in either of the two 200 mg dose groups (Cohorts 0 & 1) and six subjects (2.5%) in the 300 
mg dose group (Cohorts 2 and 3 combined) received systemic antifungals for the empirical treatment of 
fungal infections for more than 4 days while on study drug. Of the six subjects, four of the subjects had 
AML or MDS as their underlying disease and two subjects entered the study after HSCT.

Components of Clinical Failure 300 mg Dose Group (Cohorts 0 and 1) in P05520 
Survival 
In Cohort 0, 90% of subjects treated with POS IV and 91% of subjects treated with Placebo IV survived 
through Day 65. In Cohort 1, 95% of subjects treated with multiple doses of 200 mg POS IV survived 
through Day 65 and 89% of subjects in the 300-mg dosing group (Cohorts 2 and 3 combined) were 
confirmed to be alive at Day 65. 
Nine of the 13 confirmed deaths among subjects in Cohort 3 had AML or MDS as underlying disease; the 
remaining four deaths were in recipients of allogeneic HSCT. In addition to the 16 confirmed deaths, 
another 11 subjects (all in Cohort 3) were missing the Day 65 Survival Assessment. Therefore, 89% 
(210/237) subjects were confirmed to be alive at the Day 65 Survival Assessment. Three additional 
deaths were reported during the follow-up period (after completion of the treatment period, i.e. after Day 
70). 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The open, non-comparative study P05520 was not designed as a clinical efficacy study, but aimed to 
investigate the PK of the intravenous solution of posaconazole in patients and to provide additional safety 
data. The study population included patients with AML/MDS and anticipated or proven neutropenia 
(<500/mm3 for at least 7 days and HSCT recipients (cohort 3 only), with the aim to enrol patients 
representative of the target population for antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. Patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 42/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate or severe renal impairment (CLCrea < 50ml/min) were excluded from the study due to the 
restricted use of cyclodextrin in this population. 
The study design, including lack of a control group and short study duration may be acceptable with 
regards to the primary endpoint (and had been accepted by CHMP during scientific advice), but limits 
efficacy and in particular safety data evaluation.  
The clinical endpoint was a composite endpoint including proven or suspected IFI, discontinuation of 
treatment, > 4 days of non-study antifungals, and death. The criteria for diagnosis of an IFI were not 
clearly presented (investigator’s decision) and there was no adjudication. The usefulness of this 
composite endpoint is limited. 
The rate of clinical failures as defined was high, around one third of patients developed “clinical failure”, 
primarily due to treatment discontinuation.  
The rate of breakthrough invasive fungal infections was low. Comparisons between the 200mg and 
300mg dose levels are not meaningful due to the low numbers at the 200mg dose level. 
In the 300mg dose group, 3 (1%) patients had a proven IFI, while 6 (2.5%) received > 4 days of non- 
study antifungal treatment.    
In the pivotal prophylaxis trials in HSCT patients (C/I98-316), the reported IFI rate at 16 weeks was 5% 
(16/301 subjects) with an average duration study drug of 84 days. The duration of treatment and follow- 
up in study P05520 were shorter than in C/198/316.  
The incidence of IFI in the pivotal trial in AML/MDS with posaconazole oral suspension (P01899) was 
7/304 (2%); the average duration of treatment for subjects in this study was 22 days. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, the reported incidence of IFI in this trial was low and appeared in line with earlier 
prophylaxis trials with the oral suspension, however treatment duration and follow-up was shorter than in 
previous trials. As expected, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from these results. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Posaconazole concentrate for solution for infusion is an aqueous injectable solution containing 18 mg/mL 
of POS to be diluted with sodium chloride 0.9% or 5% dextrose in water prior to IV administration. The 
primary excipient in POS IV solution is sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBEβCD, marketed as Captisol), 
an excipient that is found in marketed IV products including authorised voriconazole IV formulation. This 
excipient solubilizes posaconazole by formation of soluble complexes. When solubilized as POS IV 
solution, the pH of the formulation is approximately 2.6 and when admixed with 0.9% sodium chloride or 
5% dextrose in water, the admixture solution for administration ranges from a pH of 3.1 to 3.6. It should 
be noted that SBEβCD has been associated with kidney toxicity in rat models, however, the overall 
amount of SBEβCD in the POS IV solution is anticipated to be similar to or lower than that administered 
with IV voriconazole.  
Safety in healthy volunteers 
All doses in healthy volunteers were administered via a peripheral vein. When administered peripherally 
over 90 minutes, POS IV solution caused unacceptably high rates infusion-site reactions, which were 
observed in 6 out of 9 patients. The reaction occurs with a delay, and takes days to resolve. Suspected 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 43/64 
 
 
 
 
extravasation was observed in 1 subject, the same subject also experienced liver function test 
abnormalities. Cmax in this subject was lower than for the remaining patients (and Tmax delayed), while 
AUC was in the range observed.  
After decreasing the infusion time to 30 minutes, IV POS solution was better tolerated, but injection site 
reactions were still frequent and significant enough to prevent multiple dose studies in healthy. The pH of 
the suspension formulation was between 6.0 and 8.0. Local intolerability may well be associated with the 
low pH of the infusion solution, although it seems unlikely that the pH alone is causative, as other 
solutions with similar pH cause less local toxicity.  
Arrhythmia and heart failure have been associated with azoles agents and are considered a class effect of 
azoles, but have not been observed with either oral or IV suspension POS formulations. However, the 
MAH conducted Echocardiograms in study P06356 as a faster infusion (30 minutes) and consequently 
higher plasma concentrations may cross an effect threshold. 
Decreases in ejection fraction (EF) seen in Echocardiograms of healthy volunterrs were small and 
transient, although more significant changes is patients with impaired myocardial function cannot be 
ruled out. Decreases in EF seem to be associated with Cmax.  
Safety in patients  
Patient exposure 
Overall, 268 subjects have received POS IV solution in the pivotal Phase 1b/3. This included 10 high-risk 
subjects who received a single 200 mg dose of POS IV solution, 21 high-risk subjects who received 
multiple dosing of 200 mg POS IV solution (following 200 mg BID on Day 1), and 237 high-risk subjects 
who received multiple dosing of 300 mg daily (following 300 mg BID on Day 1). The targeted subject 
population that was enrolled in P05520 was representative of the majority of patients.

Adverse events 
In the 200 mg multiple dose group (Cohort 1), almost all subjects experienced at least one treatment 
Emergent Adverse event (TEAE) (20/21 subjects [95%]), with 3 subjects (14%) reporting a 
treatment-related TEAE. Severe or life-threatening TEAEs were reported for 11 subjects (52%) and 4 
subjects (19%) discontinued study drug due to a TEAE. Overall, in the 200 mg dose group, an SAE was 
reported for 4 subjects (19%), with one death (5%). Among subjects in the 200-mg multiple dose group 
(Cohort 1), the overall incidence of specific TEAEs, the incidence of those reported with an onset during 
the IV phase, and the incidence of those reported with an onset during the Oral phase were all similar to 
those commonly reported with POS oral suspension. 
In the 300 mg multiple dose group (Cohorts 2 and 3), almost all subjects reported at least one TEAE 
(235/237 subjects [99%]) with 90 subjects (38%) reporting a treatment-related TEAE during either the 
IV or oral phase, with 72 subjects (30%) experiencing at least one treatment-related TEAE during the IV 
phase. The most commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs during the treatment phase (IV or Oral 
phases) were diarrhea (9%), nausea (8%), rash (6%), vomiting (5%), and hypokalemia (5%). The most 
commonly reported treatment-related TEAEs during the IV phase were diarrhea (8%), nausea (5%), rash 
(5%), vomiting (4%), and hypokalemia (4%). In comparison with the prior POS oral suspension 
prophylaxis study of neutropenic subjects, 34% of TEAEs were judged related to study drug, and the most

There were an additional two deaths that occurred during the follow-up period. There were no causes of 
death in Cohorts 2 and 3 (300 mg multiple dose) that were determined to be related to study treatment 
by the investigator.

Renal Adverse Events 
There were no TEAEs related to renal function reported for the subjects in the 200 mg multiple dose group 
(Cohort 1).

Overall, a total of 15 subjects (6%) reported TEAEs related to renal function. Of these, 11 subjects (5%) 
reported TEAEs related to renal safety with an onset during the IV phase. The TEAEs related to renal 
safety with an onset during the IV phase reported by more than one subject were renal failure (3 
subjects) and acute renal failure (7 subjects). 
Of the 11 subjects reporting TEAEs related to renal safety with an onset during the IV phase, only two 
subjects (1%) with renal failure were determined by the investigator to be treatment related. 
Vascular Adverse Experiences and Local Site Reactions 
There was no TEAEs related to vascular function in the 200 mg dose group. The TEAE of pulmonary 
embolism with an onset during the IV phase was reported for one subject (Subject No. 4/000113): 
Subject No. 4/000113 is a 57-year-old white male with a history of AML who was diagnosed on 
Day 3 with candidemia (unresolved). On Day 4, he was diagnosed with Enterococcus faecium 
bacteremia (unresolved). The subject died on Day 24. Macroscopic exam of autopsy showed a 
massive intrapulmonary hemorrhage, suspected bilateral embolism of arteria pulmonalis and 
disseminated aspergillosis. The subject stopped study medication on Day 5. His Day 3 POS 
concentration was 1080 ng/mL. The investigator considered the events of “massive 
intrapulmonary hemorrhage, suspected bilateral embolism and disseminated aspergillosis” 
unlikely related to treatment with study medication. 
One subject received (in violation of the protocol) nine consecutive days of POS IV solution via a 
peripheral line. This subject had several reported adverse experiences of thrombophlebitis. 
Overall, 32 subjects (14%) reported TEAEs related to embolic and vascular function. Of these, 24 subjects 
(10%) reported TEAEs related to embolic and vascular function with an onset during the IV phase. One 
subject experienced subclavian vein thrombosis during the follow-up period, which the investigator 
assessed as unlikely related to study drug 
With regard to local tolerability in subjects that received IV POS solution via a peripheral line, there were 
9 subjects who received single doses of POS IV solution via a peripheral line. Of these, only one subject 
reported a local tolerability reaction (moderate pain at the peripheral catheter site, deemed unlikely 
related to study drug).

In cohort 1, one subject reported a TEAE of hyperbilirubinaemia with an onset during the IV phase. One 
subject reported a TEAE of jaundice with an onset during the Oral phase. 
Overall, there were 9 subjects (4%) that reported TEAEs related to hepatic function. Of these, 7 subjects 
(3%) reported TEAEs related to hepatic function with an onset during the IV phase. 
Table 29. 
A comparison of the treatment related TEAEs demonstrates that within the range of Cmax levels that have 
been observed in the serial-PK evaluable population in the 300 mg dose group, there does not appear to 
be an association of higher POS Cmax concentrations with a higher incidence of specific TEAEs, though 
these analyses should be interpreted with caution given the small number of subjects in each quartile.

Laboratory findings 
The majority of laboratory value changes were mild in severity and transient in nature, and returned to 
baseline after cessation of POS therapy. For ALK-P, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin, grade shits from Grade 
0 at baseline and remained either at Grade 0-1 at baseline occurred in 3-6% of patients. During the IV 
phase of the study, the most common grade shift was in total bilirubin (14 subjects [6%]).  
For the predefined metabolic function laboratory parameters of serum potassium and serum sodium 
levels, the most common grade shift observed was in hypokalemia, with 70 subjects (30%) having a shift 
Assessment report

of two grades to Grade 2. The largest shifts that occurred were from Grade 0 to Grade 3 (21 subjects 
[9%]). 
For the predefined drug toxicity laboratory parameter of creatinine, the largest grade shift that occurred 
was one grade (from Grade 0 to 1) in 12 subjects (5%). 
Hepatic advserse effects (Hy’s law)  
The P05520 protocol prespecified criteria for significant hepatic effect according to Hy's law (ALT and/or 
AST ≥3x ULN with ALK-P ≤2x ULN and total bilirubin ≥2x ULN without evidence of biliary obstruction [or 
alternative explanation]). 
There was one subject in Cohort 1, three subjects in Cohort 2 and four subjects in Cohort 3 who met the 
predefined criteria for hepatic effect (Hy’s Law); however, each of these subjects had other reasons which 
could possibly explain the combination of increased transaminase and total bilirubin (e.g., sepsis, GVHD, 
or another drug capable of causing the observed injury). 
ACTH testing 
The mean baseline aldosterone levels pre- and post-stimulation (1 hour) were decrease during treatment 
with posaconazole as known from previous studies with other formulations. No observed electrolyte 
imbalances in potassium or sodium levels were attributed to changes in adrenal function. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Adverse events, including SAEs and deaths, were commonly seen as it can be expected in this population.  
Cohort 1 (200mg) differed from cohorts 2 and 3 (300mg) not only in the dose of IV POS solution, but also 
in the underlying disease as HSCT patients were only enrolled in cohort 3. The MAH considers that the 
safety profile for the 2 dose levels was similar, although overall treatment related AEs and serious AEs 
were more common with the 300mg dose than with 200mg. However, due to the very low numbers in the 
200mg dose group, such comparisons are not meaningful.  
The AE profile seen with IV POS solution 300mg in this population is reported to be similar to the pattern 
observed with the oral suspension. The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with 
an onset during the IV phase were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and hypokalaemia. Treatment 
related SAEs were reported from 2 subjects (hyperbilirubinaemia and pulmonary mycosis). Overall during 
the IV phase, the frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were slightly higher for AML/MDS subjects 
(36%) than in HSCT subjects (20%), in particular gastro-intestinal side effects which may be a reflection 
of the underlying conditions. Severe AEs were similar in frequency. 
Taking exposure into account, it was observed that the incidence of treatment-related TEAEs was higher 
in subjects in the second, third, and fourth quartiles when compared to subjects in the first quartile, but 
the same in subjects in the third and fourth quartile. This observation does not confirm or rule out an 
association of increased toxicity with higher POS concentrations.  
Comparisons between oral phase and IV phase show no clear differences, but due to differences in 
duration of exposure, possible delays in onset of AEs and a carry- over of the higher exposures from IV 
administration into the oral phase such comparisons have to be regarded with caution. 
The MAH reports that the safety profile in the 105 subjects who received prolonged dosing with the 300 
mg POS IV solution (≥10 consecutive days) to be similar to the safety profile for the entire 300 mg dose 
group. Safety data in patients receiving IV POS solution continuously for > 14 and in particular > 28 days 
are very limited.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 52/64 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of TEAEs related to renal safety, adrenal/metabolic safety, hepatic function, 
hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac function and gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence of those reported 
by subjects with an onset during the IV phase, and the incidence of those reported by subjects with an 
onset during the Oral phase are reported to be similar to those commonly reported with POS oral 
suspension.  
Posaconazole is known to have hepatotoxic effects. Seven of the 9 reported hepatic TEAEs in the 300 mg 
dosing groups occurred during the IV phase, 4 of which were considered severe. A further exploration of 
the incidence and severity of hepatic events did not show an association with exposure, based on the 
limited case numbers available. 
Several cases of Hy’s law were observed, with reportedly similar frequency to the oral suspension. Two 
cases fulfilling Hy’s law criteria here were considered possibly drug related by the investigators, and in the 
assessor’s view an association is not likely but cannot be ruled out in the remaining cases, as may be 
expected in this population of patients with significant disease and frequent concurrent medication 
including hepatotoxic agents.  
When combining the safety data of IV posaconazole with those of the recently approved tablet 
formulation (which resulted in similar exposures as the IV formulation) an association between higher 
POS concentration and a higher incidence of overall and treatment-related TEAEs was not observed. 
Treatment emergent adverse hepatic events were highest in the 4th quartile, while treatment related 
hepatic events were inconsistent. 
Other changes in selected laboratory evaluations in subjects in P05520 and who received POS IV solution 
were reportedly similar to that seen in the prior prophylaxis studies with POS oral suspension. 
The increased Cmax after intravenous administration has minimal effect on left ventricular ejection 
fraction in healthy volunteers, but may be more relevant in patients with pre-existing abnormalities in 
myocardial function. There were no new or unexpected findings regarding QTc changes. The quartile 
exposure analysis did not indicate an increase in adverse events, including ECG changes, with higher 
Cmax. ECGs were however not routinely performed at the time of Cmax and the number of patients 
available for evaluation was small.    
The vehicle for IV POS solution, cyclodextrin (SBECD), has been associated with kidney toxicity in rat 
models. Eleven of 15 renal TEAS occurred during the IV phase of which 10 cases are reported as renal 
failure or acute renal failure, of which 2 were reported treatment related. There was no demonstrable 
increase in treatment related renal events with IV POS solution compared to the oral suspension. 
The adverse event profile of posaconazole has been established for the oral suspension. Common adverse 
events include gastrointestinal side effects (diarrhoea and vomiting), abnormal liver function tests, 
electrolyte abnormalities and hypersensitivity reactions (rash). Hepatotoxicity is usually reversible, but 
rare cases of fatal hepatotoxicity have been reported. QT prolongation is known to occur and is a class 
effect of azoles. The pattern of the most common treatment-related AEs observed in the pivotal study for 
this intravenous solution was generally similar to the AEs seen with the oral suspension, except for 
infusion site reactions.  
Further exploration of the safety data did not show any clear evidence for an increase of overall or specific 
adverse events with the intravenous solution, however this finding is based on uncontrolled safety data 
available from the single pivotal study P05520 enrolling a relatively small number of patients. 
Local toxicity, which precludes (repeated) administration via peripheral lines, was infrequently reported 
with administration through a central line, although there is some remaining concern that local effects 
may be masked. Thromboembolic events, reported in some non-clinical studies, were not reported during 
the study. However such events, unless extensive, are very difficult to diagnose in patients. Mean and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 53/64 
 
 
 
 
median treatment duration with the intravenous solution was 11 and 9 days, respectively, ranging from 
2- 28 days. In total 67 patients received more than 14 days of IV posaconazole. None of these figures 
necessarily represents continuous treatment periods. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No clear increase in overall or specific treatment related adverse events is reported. The small numbers, 
lack of a control group and shorter duration of treatment makes the interpretation of the adverse events 
very difficult. Comparisons with other studies and the frequencies of adverse events recorded in the 
SmPC are problematic and firm conclusion cannot be drawn.  
No major additional safety concerns have been identified for IV posaconazole solution, but data are 
limited and thromboembolic events are a potential risk. Injection site reactions preclude repeated 
peripheral administration, however administration of a single dose of IV POS solution via a peripheral line 
is considered acceptable in cases where a central line is temporarily unavailable. In view of the limited 
duration of exposure and limited longer term safety data, administration of intravenous posaconazole 
solution should be of limited duration, and a switch to oral formulation when the patient’s conditions 
allows, should be recommended in the SmPC.  
The additional on-going study (P069) in the treatment of IFI, using both the intravenous and the tablet 
formulation of posaconazole is expected to generate useful additional safety data, and the applicant has 
agreed to specifically address safety aspects.

2.8.  Benefit Risk Balance 
Benefits 
•  Beneficial effects 
None 
The proposed intravenous formulation provides a means to administer posaconazole as a prophylactic 
and therapeutic agent in a situation where patients cannot take any oral medication at all or are 
unable to comply with the dietary requirement allowing the oral suspension to be absorbed to a 
satisfactory degree. When given as a single daily dose of 300 mg (administered through a central 
line), mean posaconazole exposure from the intravenous solution is higher than seen in previous 
studies with the oral suspension, given as a total daily dose of 600-800 mg in divided doses in the 
prophylaxis of IFI.  
•  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
No controlled, adequately powered clinical efficacy trial was conducted with the new formulation. The 
development programme was based on an observed exposure-response relationship in clinical trials 
with the oral suspension and relies on limited data due to low case numbers. The vast majority of 
patients is expected to achieve Cavg concentrations > 500 ng/ml, which may be associated with 
positive clinical outcome. While a trend for better outcomes with higher exposures seems plausible, a 
clear threshold has not been identified. 
Pharmacokinetics and safety data stem from patients with AML and MDS or those after HSCT who 
received posaconazole for prophylaxis. No data were generated for patients with other underlying 
diseases and active fungal infections. Data presented do not suggest that exposure in the treatment 
population is expected to be different from the prophylaxis population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 61/64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The observed data (serial PK evaluable patients) for both the 200 mg and 300 mg dose met the 
predefined exposure target for Cavg. The simulated data show that a higher proportion of subjects 
meet the exposure target with the 200 mg dose, with only a small increase of those below the target 
compared to the 300 mg dose. The 300 mg dose results in a greater proportion of patients with 
exposures beyond the upper target boundary. The applicant proposes the 300 mg dose based on the 
significantly higher number of patients expected to have a Cmin < 500ng/ml with the 200 mg dose, 
although Cmin was not the primary bridging parameter.  This approach was justified as more 
conservative, and by the lack of an observed increase of adverse events from higher exposures based 
on data available so far. 
Risks 
•  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile for posaconazole has been established for the oral formulation and includes 
hepatotoxicity and QT prolongation. The most common treatment-related adverse events during 
treatment with the IV solution were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, rash and hypokalaemia. 
Hepatotoxic effects and QT prolongation were observed. In addition, the IV solution causes local 
reactions (thrombophlebitis). 
•  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects. 
The model derived simulated data indicate that around 15% of patients are expected to exceed 
plasma concentrations of 2500 ng/ml including 3% who are expected to exceed the upper limit of 
3650 ng/ml. As exposures exceed the levels achieved in previous studies there are limited safety data 
for exposures > 2500 ng/ml. 
There was no reported increase in overall or specific adverse events, including hepatic events, with at 
higher exposures obtained with the intravenous formulation, however safety data are very limited 
and further affected by the lack of a control group and the short duration of treatment. Safety data 
from patients with exposures> 2500 and > 3750 ng/ml are sparse. No significant effect of the higher 
Cmax resulting from intravenous formulation on QT was observed, however no ECG data around the 
time of Cmax were collected in patients. It is noted that the applicant will generate such data in the 
on-going phase III trial (PN069). Mild transient decrease of echocardiographically determined left 
ventricular ejection fraction may be correlated to Cmax in healthy volunteers, and may be more 
relevant in patients with myocardial impairment.  
Thromboembolic events were reported from non-clinical studies, while thrombophlebitis has been a 
concern with peripheral administration and may occur after central intravenous administration. No 
thromboembolic events were observed in patients, but are still considered a potential risk. It is 
reflected adequately in the RMP. 
The anticipated shorter duration of continuous treatment or prophylaxis expected with this 
intravenous solution may be relevant when evaluating safety concerns. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk balance for Noxafil 300mg concentrate for solution for infusion is considered positive in 
the proposed dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/75051/2015 
Page 62/64 
 
 
 
 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The potentially greater risk of adverse events at the higher dose level of 300 mg has to be weighed 
against the risk of reduced efficacy with the 200 mg dose. Taking the lack of a documented 
exposure-effect relationship in the tested exposure range into account, the CHMP considers that the 
applicant’s choice of dose is acceptable. It is further taken into account that the reported and simulated 
plasma concentrations after 300 mg of the intravenous formulation so far are no higher than those for the 
300 mg gastro-resistant tablet formulation. Further PK and exposure data from the on-going Phase III 
study (PN069) in the treatment of IFI are expected. Additional safety and efficacy data are also expected 
in the foreseeable future from this study in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, with voriconazole 
as active comparator. 
The benefit-risk balance for Noxafil 300mg concentrate for solution for infusion is considered positive iin 
the conditions of use detailed in the product information.  
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate whether posaconazole is a substrate and/or inhibitor of the human hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.9.  Recommendation 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Noxafil 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion in the treatment of 
the following fungal infections in adults: 
- Invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or itraconazole or 
in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
- Fusariosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are 
intolerant of amphotericin B; 
- Chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or in 
patients who are intolerant of itraconazole; 
- Coccidioidomycosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or 
fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products; 
Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days of 
prior therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy. 
Noxafil is also indicated for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in the following patients: 
- Patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) expected to result in prolonged neutropenia and who are at high 
risk of developing invasive fungal infections;

- Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who are undergoing high-dose 
immunosuppressive therapy for graft versus host disease and who are at high risk of developing 
invasive fungal infections.

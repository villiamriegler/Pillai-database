IMJUDO. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is AstraZeneca AB. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. For 
information, the full indications for Imjudo will therefore be as follows2: 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab is indicated for the first line treatment of adults with 
advanced or unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) with no sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK positive mutations. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

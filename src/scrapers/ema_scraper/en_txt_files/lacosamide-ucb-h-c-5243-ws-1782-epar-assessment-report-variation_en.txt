2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Claimed therapeutic indication 
In this procedure, the MAH applies for the following extension of the indication (New text – bold 
underlined): 
Lacosamide UCB is indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age 
with epilepsy.  
Lacosamide UCB is indicated as adjunctive therapy 
• 
in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. 
• 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and 
children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
Epidemiology 
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases. Worldwide, about 65 million people are 
estimated to have epilepsy (Thurman et al, 2011). The most common seizure type in patients with 
epilepsy is partial seizures (57%), followed by tonic-clonic seizures (23%), absence seizures (6%), and 
myoclonic seizures (3%); the latter 3 seizure types comprise the majority of generalized seizures 
(convulsive and nonconvulsive) (Hauser et al, 1993).  
The incidence and prevalence of idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE) was recently described by Gesche J. 
et al., 2019. The study included all patients (≥17 years) with IGE inhabiting Funen (496 000 inhabitants), 
Denmark. The average IGE incidence (2008–2017) was 2.9/100 000 inhabitants/year. The point 
prevalence of identifiable IGE patients was 1.0/1000 adults (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 0.4/1000; 
absence epilepsy 0.3/1000, epilepsy with generalized tonic–clonic seizures alone 0.3/1000); 92.1% of the 
patients were diagnosed before 25 years of age. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The term idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) is meant to reflect the genetic aetiology without explicitly 
saying so. A genetic aetiology may be suggested by clinical research in populations with the same 
syndrome such as Childhood Absence Epilepsy or Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. Evidence for a genetic 
basis comes from studies such as Lennox’s twin studies in the 1950s and familial aggregation studies. The 
onset of IGE almost always occurs during childhood or adolescence, although there are exceptions; some 
patients develop these kinds of epilepsies after the second decade of life or, rarely, even later.

Page 8/88 
 
  
  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
According to the new ILAE classification of epilepsy from 2017, a common subgroup of the Idiopathic 
Generalized Epilepsies (IGEs) is well-recognized within the Generalized Epilepsies (I.E. Scheffer et al., 
2017). The IGEs encompass four well-established epilepsy syndromes: Childhood Absence Epilepsy, 
Juvenile Absence Epilepsy, Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy and Generalized Tonic–Clonic Seizures Alone 
(formerly known as Generalized Tonic–Clonic Seizures on Awakening but modified in recognition that 
seizures can occur at any time of day). 
Generalized seizures are those in which the first clinical changes indicate initial involvement of both brain 
hemispheres. Consciousness may be impaired, and this impairment may be the initial manifestation. 
Generalized seizure types according to the new ILAE classification are presented bellow (Fisher et al., 
2017). 
It is noted that the MAH used the old ILAE classification from 1989. According to the authors of new ILAE 
classification, the classification of generalized-onset seizures is similar to that of the 1981 classification, 
with addition of a few new types (Fischer et al., 2017). 
Typically, the onset of childhood absence epilepsy is between 4 to 8 years of age, with peak onset at ages 
6 to 7 years. Approximately 40% develop generalized tonic clonic seizures as they reach adolescence. 
The onset of juvenile absence epilepsy is between 10 to 17 years of age, with peak onset between 10 and 
12 years. These patients may have occasional tonic-clonic seizures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 9/88 
 
  
  
 
 
The onset of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy varies from 8 to 26 years and peaks at 12 to 14 years. Juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy is characterized by myoclonic seizures that appear with tonic-clonic seizures in most 
patients, and absence seizures in about one-third of patients. 
The onset of epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening is usually in the second decade of life. This 
syndrome typically presents as a generalized tonic clonic seizure within 2 hours after awakening but may 
include myoclonic and/or absence seizures. 
Idiopathic generalized epilepsy with PGTCS only is considered a syndrome in the ILAE diagnostic scheme 
(Engel, 2006) and incorporates “epilepsy with PGTCS on awakening” (ILAE, 1989; Janz, 2000). The 
terminology “IGE with PGTCS only” implies that it includes only those patients with PGTCS alone (i.e. 
without absences and/or jerks) and that these may occur at any time. Overall, PGTCS are reported to 
occur on awakening (17% to 53% of patients), diffusely while awake (23% to 36%) or during sleep (27% 
to 44%), or randomly (13% to 26%) (Wolf, 2002). It is undetermined what proportion of these patients 
also has other generalized seizures (jerks or absences). 
Age at onset varies from 6 to 47 years with a peak at 16 to 17 years; 80% have their first PGTCS in the 
second decade of life. Men (55%) slightly predominate over women, probably because of differences in 
alcohol exposure and sleep habits. Exact prevalence of “IGE with PGTCS only” is unknown. If strict criteria 
apply (PGTCS only), this may be very small (0.9% of IGE), but others give a prevalence of 13% to 15% 
among IGE (Roger et al, 1994; Oller-Daurella and Oller, 1994). 
Management 
In the past decade, several new options for the medical treatment of epilepsy have been introduced, 
including novel AEDs and vagus nerve stimulation. The newer AEDs differ from older agents in several 
important ways, including mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and PK characteristics (Herman and 
Pedley, 1998). 
Between 15% and 40% of patients with generalized epilepsy remain refractory to therapy or do not 
tolerate the currently available AEDs (valproate, ethosuximide, phenytoin [PHT], lamotrigine [LTG], 
carbamazepine [CBZ], topiramate, and levetiracetam) (Bartolomei et al, 1997; Verrotti et al, 2007); 
some of these AEDs can induce serious, life threatening AEs (such as aplastic anemia, rash, hepatic 
failure). Generalized tonic-clonic seizures may respond to drugs that aggravate typical absences and/or 
myoclonic jerks (Genton, 2000; Verrotti et al, 2007). Two IGE seizure types, typical absences and 
myoclonic jerks, are particularly prone to aggravation by certain AEDs (CBZ, vigabatrin, tiagabine, PHT, 
phenobarbital [PB], and LTG). The pharmacodynamic aggravation is usually associated with a clear 
increase of interictal (and ictal) EEG changes. 
Of patients with IGE experiencing PGTCS, clinical experience has shown that up to 30% of patients who 
are treated with currently available AEDs have insufficient seizure control or unacceptable drug 
tolerability according to the MAH. Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatment 
options in this patient population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Lacosamide (LCM) is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized 
as anticonvulsive drug candidates. Electrophysiological studies have shown that LCM enhances the slow 
inactivation of sodium channels by attenuating the proportion of available channels in a time- and 
voltage-dependent manner. This leads to a reduction of sodium channel long-term availability which 
increases activation thresholds and reduces neuronal hyperexcitability and the potential for seizures.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 10/88 
 
  
  
Lacosamide (LCM) has been approved in the EU (oral tablets, oral solution, and solution for intravenous 
[iv] infusion) as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in patients 4 years of age and older. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In this procedure, the MAH applied for the new indication for use of LCM as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in patients with idiopathic generalized 
epilepsy (IGE) from 4 years of age. 
The demonstration of efficacy and safety for the indication extension is based on a pivotal study SP0982 
(a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study designed to 
assess the efficacy and safety of LCM as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled PGTCS in study participants 
4 years of age and older with IGE) and is in general in agreement with the CHMP Scientific Advice issued 
on 20 Sep 2012 (EMEA/H/SA/1570/4/2012/II). The pivotal study SP0982 supporting the PGTCS 
indication is listed as study 20 in the Lacosamide UCB Pharma S.A. PIP EMEA-000402-PIP03-17-M03.  
The development of LCM for use in PGTCS was initiated with SP0961 (a Phase 2, open-label pilot study 
to assess the safety of oral LCM as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled PGTCS in study participants with 
IGE) and SP0962 (a Phase 2, open-label extension study to assess the safety and seizure frequency 
associated with long-term oral LCM for uncontrolled PGTCS in study participants with IGE). 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The studies were conducted in accordance with the current version of the applicable regulatory and 
International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, the ethical 
principles that have their origin in the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the local laws of the 
countries involved, as stated by the MAH.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the ERA guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, an updated ERA report, evaluating the 
potential environmental impact of the new indication of Vimpat in the treatment of primary generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS), was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 11/88 
 
  
  
 
 
Summary of fate and effect analysis 
The risk characterisation shows that the revised PEC/PNEC ratios based on worst case market 
penetration values are lower than the ERA guideline Tier B trigger values.   
It can therefore be concluded that use of lacosamide, in the current and proposed new indications, is 
unlikely to present a risk to the terrestrial and aquatic environments. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Lacosamide. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP agrees that the no new non-clinical data are needed to support the proposed extension of 
indication.  
From the updated ERA data, the use of lacosamide, in the current and proposed new indications, is 
unlikely to present a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In order to complement the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of lacosamide characterized for the current 
indication, the MAH investigated the PK of oral LCM for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) 
in study participants with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in the pivotal study SP0982. 
Lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with negligible first-pass effect 
and has minimal protein binding properties. The high oral bioavailability of approximately 100% is not 
affected by food. Peak plasma concentrations occur between 0.5 and 4hours post dose. The average 
maximal plasma concentration following 200mg twice daily (bid) is about 10μg/mL (approximately 
40μM). The PK is linear with respect to dose and exhibits low intra-and inter-study participant variability. 
Approximately 40% of the dose is excreted by the kidney as unchanged compound. The major metabolic 
pathway of LCM is demethylation. The plasma half-life of the unchanged drug is approximately 13hours 
and is not altered by different doses or by multiple dosing. 
Several population PK analyses has been conducted during the development program. PK data from the 
pivotal study SP0982 were used to update the existing popPK model. The modeling data set comprised 
data from the prior population PK modeling project CL0447-Part I, including the adult data from CL0261, 
as well as new data from SP0982. Model parameters were re-estimated, and the covariate analysis was 
revisited, see table below. Visual predictive checks were performed for the final reduced population PK 
covariate model to investigate if model simulations correspond to observed medians and ranges for the 
entire population, stratified by adults and children (figure below).

Comparison of exposures in pediatric study-participants (POS and PGTCS) 
and adults (POS) 
In the figure below (3-3), the pink shaded area depicts 90% of the simulated adult Css values for an 
oral dose of LCM of 200mg bid in all panels, and the red line and blue shaded area depict the median 
and 90% of the simulated pediatric Css values for POS pediatric study participants (left) and PGTCS 
pediatric study participants (right). The red circles indicate the predicted Css values for the pediatric 
individuals in all studies with POS (left) and with PGTCS (right). The figure shows that the dosing 
regimen resulted in model-predicted pediatric Css values in the adult range for most body weights and 
ages for both POS and PGTCS study participants. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Lacosamide is a member of a series of functionalized amino acids that were specifically synthesized as 
anticonvulsive drug candidates. Electrophysiological studies have shown that LCM enhances the slow 
inactivation of sodium channels by attenuating the proportion of available channels in a time- and 
voltage-dependent manner. This leads to a reduction of sodium channel long-term availability which 
increases activation thresholds and reduces neuronal hyperexcitability and the potential for seizures.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
The MAH provided PK/PD modelling but concluded that the model relating time to second PGTCS and LCM 
exposure could not be reliably constructed, and simulation of alternative dosing strategies, including a 
monotherapy scenario, could not be performed. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics between POS and PGTCS patients are not expected to be different. The MAH has 
updated the previous popPK model and the results show that exposure (Css) in POS patients is similar to 
POS patients and also that exposure is in the adult range of exposure. The model includes estimated 
exponent for clearance which is not considered ideal. Goodness of fit plots of LCM concentrations vs. 
population predictions (PRED) and individual predictions (IPRED) showed absence of systematic model 
misspecification. Visual predictive checks (VPC) performed for the final reduced population PK covariate 
model (run023) indicate model adequacy. Just shrinkage values for Vc/F and Ka, 53.5% and 73.8% 
respectively are considerate too high values making the EBEs for Vc/F and Ka unsuitable for diagnostic 
purposes. For these parameters, also IIV values estimated using SIR for the final reduced population PK 
covariate model (run023) were quite high. The provided VPC, included VPCs stratified on age, look 
adequate. 
The PK/PD modelling attempt was not deemed satisfactory by the MAH and was not used.  
This is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP agrees with the conclusion that PK is similar in POS and PGTCS patients, including paediatric 
patients from 4 years old and older.

Title of Study 
SP0982: a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study 
designed to assess the efficacy of oral LCM versus placebo as adjunctive therapy for PGTCS in study 
participants ≥4 years of age with IGE taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs independent of the number of prior 
failed AEDs.

Methods 
Figure 1. SP0982 overall study design schematic diagram 
SP0982 was a time-to-event study which enrolled study participants in order to observe 125 events (an 
event was defined as the occurrence of the second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period). 
Although this was a time-to-event study, study participants were required to complete a minimum of 
6 weeks of treatment; study participants could have completed 24 weeks of treatment with no event, 
completed at 6 weeks if an event had occurred during titration, or completed the study between 6 and 24 
weeks after an event had occurred. Enrolment was discontinued once the 125th event occurred.  
Study participants were randomized to receive LCM or placebo in a 1:1 fashion and stratified by Baseline 
PGTCS frequency (≤2 per 28 days vs >2 per 28 days for the 16
week Combined Baseline Period prior to 
randomization) and by age at informed consent (≥4 to <12 years of age, ≥12 to <18 years of age, and 
‑
≥18 years of age). 
Study participants 
To be eligible to participate in this study, the study participant must have met all inclusion criteria. The 
key inclusion criteria are listed below:  
- Male and female ≥4 years of age.  
- confirmed diagnosis at least 24 weeks prior to Visit 1 and a disease onset prior to 30 years of age, 
consistent with IGE experiencing PGTCS (Type IIE) that were classifiable according to the ILAE 
Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ILAE, 1981). 
- ≥3 PGTCS during the 16-week Combined Baseline (12-week Historical Baseline plus 4-week Prospective 
Baseline) distributed as described below: 
- at least 3 PGTCS should have occurred during the 16-week Combined Baseline Period, 
- at least 2 PGTCS should have occurred during the 12-week Historical Baseline Period, 
- of the above seizures, at least 1 PGTCS should have occurred during the first 8 weeks and 
atleast 1 PGTCS should have occurred during the second 8 weeks of the 16-week Combined 
Baseline Period.

- If a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/computed tomography (CT) scan had been performed, 
there must have been no evidence of any progressive abnormality or any lesion likely to be associated 
with partial-onset seizures. 
- Study participant had been maintained on a stable dose regimen of 1 to 2 non-benzodiazepine 
marketed AEDs with no benzodiazepine AEDs OR 1 benzodiazepine marketed AED with 1 to 2 non-
benzodiazepine marketed AEDs for at least 28 days prior to Visit 1 with or without additional concurrent 
stable VNS. 
- Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) must have been in place for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 with 
constant settings for at least 28 days prior to Visit 1 and during the Prospective Baseline and Treatment 
Period. 
Key exclusion criteria were a history of partial-onset seizures or EEG findings indicative of partial onset 
seizures, symptomatic generalized epilepsy (eg, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome typically presenting with 
seizures including tonic seizures), some other related syndrome like Doose’s syndrome (typically 
presenting with myoclonic-atonic seizures), or evidence of both focal and generalized epilepsy, history of 
convulsive status epilepticus 1 year prior to screening, and current or previous diagnosis of pseudo 
seizures, conversion disorders, or other nonepileptic ictal events which could have been confused with 
seizures. 
Treatments 
Investigational medicinal product was provided as LCM oral solution (syrup) (LCM 10mg/mL), LCM tablets 
(LCM 50mg), and matching Placebos. Study medication was administered orally bid (at approximately 12-
hour intervals in the morning and in the evening).  
For study participants <30kg, the target dose for the Maintenance Period was 12mg/kg/day (oral 
solution). For study participants ≥30kg to <50kg, the target dose for the Maintenance Period was 
8mg/kg/day (oral solution). For study participants ≥50kg, the target dose for the Maintenance Period was 
400mg/day (tablets). The tablet formulation was used for adult study participants (≥18 years of age) and 
pediatric study participants weighing ≥50kg, while the oral solution formulation was used for pediatric 
study participants weighing <50kg.  
Objectives 
The primary study objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of oral LCM vs Placebo as adjunctive therapy 
for uncontrolled PGTCS in study participants with IGE currently taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs 
independent of the number of prior failed AEDs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 18/88 
 
  
  
 
The secondary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of LCM in study participants with 
IGE with uncontrolled PGTCS. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the time to the second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period.  
The key secondary efficacy variable was seizure freedom for PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment 
Period, estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis.  
The other secondary efficacy variables were time to the first PGTCS during the Treatment Period, days 
with seizures per 28 days, seizure-free status for PGTCS, seizure-free for all generalized seizure types, 
responder status for reduction in PGTCS frequency, responder status for reduction in days with absences 
seizures and with myoclonic seizures, PGTCS worsening and health quality related outcomes. 
Sample size 
Observing 125 events (study participants who had a second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment 
Period) would provide 90% power to observe an HR of 0.56 at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a dropout 
rate of <15%. The observed HR was based on a 25.4% survival rate for Placebo and 48.2% for 
lamotrigine from a previous study comparing lamotrigine and Placebo (French et al, 2007).  
Randomisation 
Interactive response technology (IRT) was used for assigning eligible study participants to a treatment 
regimen based on a predetermined production randomization and/or packaging schedule provided by 
UCB. The randomization schedule was produced by the IRT vendor who was otherwise not involved in this 
study.  
Blinding (masking) 
UCB Global Clinical Trial Supply created a packaging list using a validated application. The packaging list 
was provided to the IRT vendor and to the packaging vendor who prepared the kits accordingly. 
The treatment randomization schedule was generated by UCB (or designee) in a manner that ensured 
that the study team remained blinded, in accordance with current standard operating procedures (SOPs). 
The randomization schedule was maintained in a secure location until the study was unblinded for the 
final statistical analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) served as the primary analysis population for assessing efficacy endpoints. 
The FAS was a subset of the Safety Set (SS) that consisted of all study participants with at least 1 seizure 
diary assessment during the Treatment Period. The primary efficacy variable was evaluated using a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model with an effect for treatment, using the following pooled strata: 
- Stratum 1: Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days and paediatric 
- Stratum 2: Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days and adult 
- Stratum 3: Baseline PGTCS frequency >2 per 28 days and All (paediatric and adult) 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 19/88 
 
  
  
The stratified hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using the placebo arm as the reference group. The 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the HR was also reported.  
Additionally, a KM plot for time to event, as well as the KM estimate for the median time to event and 
95% CI, were provided. If the median time was not estimable, then the 25th percentile and 95% CI were 
provided. The number of events was reported by treatment group for the Titration Period, first 12 Weeks, 
and Treatment Period, as well as the percentage of study participants who were censored in the analysis. 
The summary of time to event during the 166-day Treatment Period was presented by all subgroups for 
the FAS. A KM plot for time to second PGTCS by some subgroups was also provided. 
Sensitivity analyses on the primary efficacy endpoint were conducted in order to assess the effect of 
dropouts, important protocol deviations, and operational bias on the primary endpoint. 
Provided that the primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant, a gatekeeping strategy was used 
to test the key secondary efficacy variable. For the gatekeeping strategy, if the primary endpoint was 
statistically significant at the 5% level, then the key secondary efficacy endpoint was also assessed at the 
5% significance level. If the primary endpoint failed to reach statistical significance, then the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint was exploratory only. No other efficacy endpoints would be assessed for 
significance. Analyses of all other secondary efficacy variables were descriptive in manner and exploratory 
only.  
Analysis of the key secondary efficacy variable was evaluated using an extended Mantel-Haenszel testing 
procedure which took into account that the study participants were initially stratified for the study 
participants’ Baseline PGTCS frequency and development (adult vs paediatric). The number and 
percentage of study participants who experienced a PGTCS or censoring and the KM seizure-free rate 
from PGTCS (and 2-sided 95% CI) by Day 166 were presented by treatment group for each stratum and 
overall. The stratified seizure-freedom rate from PGTCS (and 2-sided 95% CI) at Day 166 for each 
treatment group and the difference between treatment groups were presented.  
Time to first PGTCS was calculated using the same algorithm as the calculation for the time to second 
PGTCS endpoint. A KM plot for time to first PGTCS was provided.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, a total of 350 study participants were screened at 115 sites. A total of 110 study participants 
(31.4%) were considered screen failures; the most common primary reason for screen failure was 
ineligibility (92 study participants [26.3%]). A total of 37 study participants (10.6%) were Baseline 
failures due to PGTCS frequency during the Combined Baseline Period. 
Overall, a total of 242 study participants started the study, including 121 study participants each in the 
LCM and Placebo groups, and 213 study participants (88.0%) completed the study (103 study 
participants [85.1%] in the LCM group and 110 study participants [90.9%] in the Placebo group). A total 
of 29 study participants (12.0%) discontinued the study, including 18 study participants (14.9%) in the 
LCM group and 11 study participants (9.1%) in the Placebo group.

The median number of PGTCS per 28 days during the Combined Baseline Period was 1.25 (range: 0.3 to 
12.3) for the LCM group and 1.24 (range: 0.7 to 19.4) for the placebo group, with the majority of study 
participants in both groups having ≤2 PGTCS per 28 days during the Combined Baseline Period based on 
the IRT (95 study participants [78.5%] in each group). 
A total of 241 out of 242 study participants had a history of generalized seizures, most commonly 
classified in both the LCM and placebo groups as tonic-clonic (120 study participants [99.2%] and 121 
study participants [100%], respectively).  
The ILAE seizure classification history is presented in the following table:

Table 5. ILAE seizure classification history (SS) 
All pediatric study participants in the LCM and Placebo groups had a generalized seizure classification 
history of tonic-clonic seizures (24 study participants and 25 study participants, respectively). A greater 
proportion of pediatric study participants in the LCM group had a generalized seizure classification history 
of absence seizures compared with Placebo (58.3% [n=14] and 40.0% [n=10], respectively). The 
proportion of pediatric study participants with a generalized seizure classification history of myoclonic 
seizures was 20.8% (n=5) in the LCM group and 28.0% (n=7) in the Placebo group.  
For adults, nearly all study participants had a generalized seizure classification history of tonic-clonic 
seizures (96 study participants [99.0%] in the LCM group and 96 study participants [100%] in the 
Placebo group). The proportion of adult study participants with absence seizures (35 study participants 
[36.1%] and 31 study participants [32.3%], respectively) and myoclonic seizures (41 study participants 
[42.3%] and 41 study participants [42.7%], respectively) was similar between the LCM and Placebo 
groups.

Table 6. Classification of epileptic syndrome (SS)  
The predominant epileptic syndrome classifications for study participants in the LCM and Placebo group 
were similar overall and by development (pediatric and adult). 
The most common concomitant AEDs and benzodiazepines at study entry in the LCM and Placebo groups 
were valproate (59 study participants [48.8%] and 67 study participants [55.4%], respectively), 
levetiracetam (55 study participants [45.5%] and 48 study participants [39.7%], respectively), 
lamotrigine (36 study participants [29.8%] and 37 study participants [30.6%], respectively), and 
topiramate (16 study participants [13.2%] and 15 study participants [12.4%], respectively). 
For the paediatric study participants, the most common concomitant AEDs and benzodiazepines in the 
LCM and Placebo groups at study entry were valproate (50.0% [n=12] and 56.0% [n=14], respectively), 
levetiracetam (54.2% [n=13] and 36.0% [n=9], respectively), lamotrigine (33.3% [n=8] and 32.0% 
[n=8], respectively), topiramate (12.5% [n=3] and 12.0% [n=3], respectively), and oxcarbazepine 
(12.5% [n=3] and 4.0% [n=1], respectively). A total of 5 paediatric study participants were taking 
benzodiazepines (3 study participants [12.5%] in the LCM group and 2 study participants [8.0%] in the 
Placebo group), which included clonazepam (1 study participant [4.2%] in the LCM group and 2 study 
participants [8.0%] in the Placebo group) and clobazam (2 study participants [8.3%] in the LCM group 
and no study participants in the Placebo group).

For adult study participants, the most common concomitant AEDs and benzodiazepines in the LCM and 
Placebo groups at study entry were valproate (48.5% [n=47] and 55.2% [n=53], respectively), 
levetiracetam (43.3% [n=42] and 40.6% [n=39], respectively), lamotrigine (28.9% [n=28] and 30.2% 
[n=29], respectively), topiramate (13.4% [n=13] and 12.5% [n=12], respectively), and clonazepam 
(10.3% [n=10] and 10.4% [n=10], respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) served as the primary population for assessing primary, secondary, and other 
efficacy endpoints. A total of 240 study participants (99.2%) had at least 1 seizure diary assessment 
during the Treatment Period and were included in the FAS, including 119 study participants (98.3%) in 
the LCM group and all 121 study participants (100%) in the placebo group. One study participant in the 
LCM group was randomized after the 125th event and was excluded from the primary and secondary 
endpoint analyses, resulting in a total of 118 study participants in the LCM group. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS), which excluded study participants who completed fewer than 6 weeks of 
treatment or study participants with important protocol deviations affecting the interpretation of the 
primary efficacy analysis, included 207 study participants (85.5%) overall, with 104 study participants 
(86.0%) in the LCM group and 103 study participants (85.1%) in the placebo group. 
The Safety Set (SS) served as the primary population for assessing the number of days with absence 
seizures and number of days with myoclonic seizures per 28 days (observed results and percent changes 
from Prospective Baseline). A total of 242 study participants (100%) received at least 1 dose of study 
medication (LCM or placebo) and were included in the SS, including 121 study participants each in the 
LCM and placebo groups. 
The proportions of study participants who completed the study were similar in the LCM and placebo 
treatment groups. A total of 213 study participants (88.0%) completed the study (103 study participants 
[85.1%] in the LCM group and 110 study participants [90.9%] in the placebo group). A total of 29 study 
participants (12.0%) discontinued the study, including 18 study participants (14.9%) in the LCM group 
and 11 study participants (9.1%) in the placebo group. The most common primary reason for 
discontinuation in the LCM and placebo groups was AE (10 study participants [8.3%] and 4 study 
participants [3.3%], respectively). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable 
The primary efficacy variable was the time to the second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
The primary efficacy assessment was based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS).

Table 7. Analysis of time to second PGTCS (125 events) (FAS) 
a Study participants who completed the Treatment Period without having a second PGTCS during the Treatment Period 
were censored. If the study participant’s Treatment Period participation was less than 166 days, they were censored on 
the date of the last dose of study medication. If the study participant’s Treatment Period participation was greater than 
24 weeks minus the visit window for Visit 10, they were censored as of Day 167 or the date after the 125th event. 
b An HR <1 indicates time to second PGTCS was improved for LCM compared with placebo. 
Figure 2‒1: Kaplan-Meier estimates for time to second PGTCS (FAS) 
The risk of developing a second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period was statistically significantly 
lower in the LCM group compared with the placebo group; the survival estimates at the end of the 
Treatment Period were 55.27% in the LCM group and 33.37% in the placebo group (HR: 0.540 [95% CI: 
0.377, 0.774]; p<0.001) (Table 9). Overall, the cumulative number of events (ie. second PGTCS) during 
the 24-week Treatment Period was 49 events in the LCM group and 76 events in the placebo group. The 
median time to second PGTCS was 77.0 days (95%CI: 49.0, 128.0) for the placebo group. For the LCM 
group, the median time to second PGTCS could not be estimated by KM methods because ˃50% of study 
participants did not experience a second PGTCS by Day 166.

 a An HR <1 indicates time to second PGTCS was improved for LCM compared with placebo. Wald's method was used 
to calculate the p-value and CIs. 
The survival rates were numerically greater in the LCM group compared with the placebo group for all 
subgroups assessed. Of the 125 events analyzed in the primary efficacy analysis, 23 events (18.4%) 
were observed in pediatric study participants (including 9 events in the LCM group and 14 events in the 
placebo group). 
All sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results, with the risk of developing a second PGTCS 
during the 24-week Treatment Period statistically significantly lower in the LCM group compared with the 
placebo group for all analyses.

a Study participants censored prior to or at Day 166. 
b Estimated by extended Mantel Haenszel methods. 
c Based on a chi-square test on 1 degree of freedom. 
The stratified KM estimate of the proportion of study participants who were seizure free at Day 166 was 
31.3% (95% CI: 22.8%, 39.9%) in the LCM group and 17.2% (95% CI: 10.4%, 24.0%) in the placebo 
group. The difference in stratified seizure freedom rate at Day 166 between the LCM and placebo groups 
was 14.1% (95% CI: 3.2%, 25.1%); this difference was statistically significant (p=0.011).  
Within the strata that evaluated Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days (stratum 1 and stratum 2), the 
proportion of study participants who were seizure free was higher in stratum 2 (Baseline PGTCS 
frequency ≤2 per 28 days and adult) for both groups (34.2% and 22.3% for the LCM and placebo groups, 
respectively) compared with stratum 1 (Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days and pediatric; 22.9% 
and 14.3% for the LCM and placebo groups, respectively). For stratum 3 (Baseline PGTCS frequency >2 
per 28 days), the KM estimates of the proportion of study participants who were seizure free at Day 166 
were 30.0% for the LCM group and 4.9% for the placebo group.

Time to first PGTCS during the 166-day Treatment Period 
A summary of the analysis of time to first PGTCS is presented in the following table: 
Table 10. Analysis of time to first PGTCS (FAS) 
aStudy participants who completed the Treatment Period without having a first PGTCS during the Treatment Period 
were censored. If the study participant’s Treatment Period participation was less than 166 days, they were censored on 
the date of the last dose of study medication. If the study participant’s Treatment Period participation was greater than 
24 weeks minus the visit window for Visit 10, they were censored as of Day 167 or the date after the 125th event. 
b An HR <1 indicates time to first PGTCS was improved for LCM compared with placebo. 
The risk of developing a first PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period was lower in the LCM group 
compared with the placebo group; the survival estimates at the end of the Treatment Period were 
30.97% in the LCM group and 17.27% in the placebo group (HR: 0.683 [95% CI: 0.507, 0.921]; 
p=0.012) (Table 12). Overall, the cumulative number of events (ie, first PGTCS) during the 24-week 
Treatment Period was 79 events in the LCM group and 97 events in the placebo group. The median time 
to first PGTCS was 36.0 days (95% CI: 25.0, 78.0) for the LCM group and 20.0 days (95% CI: 13.0, 
34.0) for the placebo group. 
Other efficacy variables 
PGTCS frequency per 28 days 
The median PGTCS frequency per 28 days at Combined Baseline was 1.25 (range: 0.3 to 12.3) in the LCM 
group and 1.24 (range: 0.7 to 19.4) in the placebo group. Greater median percent changes from 
Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days were observed in the LCM group compared with the 
placebo group during the Titration Period (-66.37% and -42.71%, respectively), first 12 weeks (-71.33% 
and -55.69%, respectively), and 24-week Treatment Period (-77.92% and -43.24%, respectively).  
For pediatric study participants, the median PGTCS frequency at Combined Baseline was 1.01 (0.7 to 7.5) 
in the LCM group and 1.00 (range: 0.7 to 19.4) in the placebo group. Similar median percent changes 
from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days were observed in the LCM and placebo groups 
during the Titration Period (-33.33% and -32.74%, respectively). However, greater median percent 
changes from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days were observed in the LCM group 
compared with the placebo group during first 12 weeks (-67.06% and -56.08%, respectively) and 24-
week Treatment Period (-80.64% and -31.20%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 30/88 
 
  
  
 
For adult study participants, the median PGTCS frequency at Combined Baseline was 1.26 (range: 0.3 to 
12.3) in the LCM group and 1.49 (range: 0.7 to 15.0) in the placebo group. Greater median percent 
changes from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days were observed in the LCM group 
compared with the placebo group during the Titration Period (-100.00% and -46.67%, respectively), first 
12 weeks (-77.84% and -51.80%, respectively), and 24-week Treatment Period (-77.71% and -43.96%, 
respectively). 
The median PGTCS frequency per 28 days was rather low at the combined baseline period, (1.25 and 
1.24, for LCM and PBO groups, respectively) despite the inclusion criteria requiring at least 3 PGTCS 
during combined baseline period. Moreover, median values were significantly lower than the 
corresponding mean value (1.88 and 2.02, respectively), the distribution is thus skewed to the right 
indicating that the scores fall toward the lower side of the frequency scale. Moreover, Baseline LCM values 
are lower compared to PBO and differences are observed between SD values (1.76 vs 2.42). For a time-
to-event analysis, it is crucial that the baseline conditions (including the magnitude of SD) are as much 
similar as possible, to support the assumption that the probability to develop a second seizure is similar in 
the two arms.  
The reduction of median PGTCS frequency from Combined Baseline per 28 days was highest at 24-week 
Treatment Period and similar between children and adults. 
Days with seizures per 28 days 
Overall, the median number of days with absence seizures during Prospective Baseline was 0.0 days 
(range: 0 to 28 days) for the LCM group and 1.5 days (range: 0 to 28 days) for the placebo group. 
Greater median percent changes (improvement) from Prospective Baseline in days with absence seizures 
were observed in the LCM group compared with the placebo group during the Titration Period (-24.6% 
and -11.1%, respectively), first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period (-30.4% and -13.3%, respectively), 
and 24-week Treatment Period (-30.1% and -15.3%, respectively). 
For pediatric study participants, the median number of days with absence seizures during Prospective 
Baseline was 0.0 days (range: 0 to 18 days) in the LCM group and 1.0 days (range: 0 to 6 days) in the 
placebo group. Greater median percent changes from Prospective Baseline in days with absence seizures 
were observed in the LCM group compared with the placebo group during the Titration Period (-51.8% 
and-8.9%, respectively) and the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period (-51.8% and -28.6%, 
respectively). The median percent change in days with absence seizures from Prospective Baseline during 
the 24-week Treatment Period was -51.8% for pediatric study participants in the LCM group and -44.6% 
for pediatric study participants in the placebo group. 
For adult study participants, the median number of days with absence seizures during Prospective 
Baseline was 2.0 days (range: 0 to 28 days) in the LCM group and 1.5 days (range: 0 to 28 days) in the 
placebo group. The median percent changes from Prospective Baseline in days with absence seizures in 
the LCM and placebo groups were similar during the Titration Period (-21.9% and -13.2%, respectively), 
but were greater in the LCM group compared with the placebo group during first 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period (-30.4% and -13.2%, respectively) and 24-week Treatment Period (-30.1% and -
13.3%, respectively). 
Overall, the median number of days with myoclonic seizures during Prospective Baseline was 2.0 days 
(range: 0 to 28 days) for the LCM group and 1.0 days (range: 0 to 28 days) for the placebo group. The 
median percent changes from Prospective Baseline in number of days with myoclonic seizures for the LCM 
and placebo groups were -32.5% and -51.8%, respectively, during the Titration Period; -43.8% and -
65.7%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and -54.6% and -65.7%, 
respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 31/88 
 
  
  
For pediatric study participants, the median number of days with myoclonic seizures during Prospective 
Baseline was 3.0 days (range: 0 to 17 days) in the LCM group and 1.1 days (range: 0 to 28 days) in the 
placebo group. The median percent changes from Prospective Baseline in number of days with myoclonic 
seizures for pediatric study participants in the LCM and placebo groups were 12.4% and -42.2%, 
respectively, during the Titration Period; 11.5% and -41.6%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of 
the Treatment Period; and 11.5% and -34.0%, respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. The 
worsening of myoclonic seizures following LCM administration in paediatric patients was also evident 
when treatment effect was expressed as changes in median myoclonic seizures frequency. 
For adult study participants, the median number of days with myoclonic seizures during Prospective 
Baseline was 1.5 days (range: 0 to 28 days) in the LCM group and 0.5 days (range: 0 to 28 days) in the 
placebo group. The median percent changes from Prospective Baseline in number of days with myoclonic 
seizures for adult study participants in the LCM and placebo groups were -40.0% and -55.7%, 
respectively, during the Titration Period, -44.1% and -70.6%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of 
the Treatment Period, and -55.9% and -70.6%, respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Number of patients with absence seizures was rather high in LCM group (40.5%) and in placebo group 
(33.9%). The number of days with absence seizures was relatively low during the Prospective Baseline 
period in both treatment groups (see above). The LCM treatment reduced frequency of days with absence 
seizures at higher degree compared to placebo, especially in paediatric population.  
The median number of days with myoclonic seizures during Prospective Baseline was slightly higher in 
LCM group compared to placebo. It seems that the percent change of days with myoclonic seizures was 
lower in LCM group compared to placebo, especially in paediatric patients. The explanation of this 
observation is not obvious (LoQ). 
It is noted that while frequency of PGTCS is compared to Combined Baseline period the frequency of days 
with absences and myoclonic seizures are compared to Prospective Baseline period. The MAH was asked 
to clarify the arguments for the selection of different baselines for comparison. The MAH stated that 
myoclonic seizures were anticipated to be more difficult to be remembered back from the 12-week 
Historical Baseline Period. Due to the potential for under-reporting of myoclonic seizures with the use of 
the Historical Baseline, the Prospective Baseline was chosen for myoclonic seizures. This potential risk is 
acknowledged.  
Potentially under-reporting of myoclonic seizures during the historical baseline period would result in even 
higher apparent worsening of them during the treatment period. Since worsening of myoclonic seizures is 
accepted by the MAH and proposed to be considered as an adverse event, this issue is not further 
pursued.

Seizure-free status for PGTCS 
A summary of seizure-free status for PGTCS is presented for the FAS in the following table: 
The percentages of pediatric study participants who had seizure-free status for PGTCS in the LCM and 
placebo group were 25.0% (6 of 24) and 28.0% (7 of 25), respectively, during the Titration Period; 
25.0% (6 of 24) and 16.0% (4 of 25), respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; 
and 13.0% (3 of 23) and 8.3% (2 of 24), respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
For adult study participants, the percentages of study participants in the LCM and placebo groups who 
had seizure-free status for PGTCS were 48.9% (45 of 92) and 34.4% (32 of 93), respectively, during the 
Titration Period; 42.5% (37 of 87) and 24.2% (22 of 91), respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period; 31.4% (27 of 86) and 14.4% (13 of 90), respectively during the 24-week Treatment 
Period. 
It seems that more adult patients (27.5%) achieved seizure free status for PGTCS during 24-week 
Treatment Period compared to paediatric patients (13%).  
Seizure-free status for all generalized seizure types 
Overall, the percentage of study participants who had seizure-free status for all generalized seizure types 
was higher in the LCM group compared with the placebo group for the first 12 weeks of the Treatment 
Period and the 24-week Treatment Period. 
The percentages of study participants who had seizure-free status for all generalized seizure types in the 
LCM and placebo group were 33.6% (39 of 116) and 27.1% (32 of 118), respectively, during the Titration 
Period; 27.9% (31 of 111) and 17.2% (20 of 116), respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period; and 21.1% (23 of 109) and 13.2% (15 of 114), respectively, during the 24-week 
Treatment Period. 
For pediatric study participants, the percentages of study participants who had seizure-free status for all 
generalized seizure types in the LCM and placebo group were 20.8% (5 of 24) and 20.0% (5 of 25), 
respectively, during the Titration Period; 20.8% (5 of 24) and 8.0% (2 of 25), respectively, during the 
first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 17.4% (4 of 23) and 4.2% (1 of 24), respectively, during the 
24-week Treatment Period.  
For adult study participants, the percentages of study participants who had seizure-free status for all 
generalized seizure types in the LCM and placebo group were 37.0% (34 of 92) and 29.0% (27 of 93), 
respectively, during the Titration Period; 29.9% (26 of 87) and 19.8% (18 of 91), respectively, during the 
first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 22.1% (19 of 86) and 15.6% (14 of 90), respectively, during 
the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 33/88 
 
  
  
 
It appears that proportion of LCM treated patients with seizure-free status for all generalized seizure 
types was reduced from the titration period (33.6%) to 24-week treatment period (21.1%). Similar trend, 
though, was also observed for placebo arm. 
Responder status for reduction in PGTCS frequency 
The 50% responder rates for study participants in the LCM and placebo groups were 54.6% and 43.8%, 
respectively, during the Titration Period; 68.9% and 52.1%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period; and 68.1% and 46.3%, respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
For pediatric study participants, the 50% responder rates for the LCM and placebo groups were 29.2% 
and 28.0%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 75.0% and 60.0%, respectively during the first 12 
weeks of the Treatment Period; and 70.8% and 44.0%, respectively, during the 24-week Treatment 
Period.  
For adult study participants, the 50% responder rates in the LCM and placebo groups were 61.1% and 
47.9%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 67.4% and 50.0%, respectively, during the first 12 
weeks of the Treatment Period; and 67.4% and 46.9%, respectively, for the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Responder status for reduction in days with absence seizures 
The 50% responder rates for reduction in days with absence seizures for the LCM and placebo groups 
were 15.7% and 16.7%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 19.6% and 14.3%, respectively, during 
the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 19.6% and 16.7%, respectively, during the 24-week 
Treatment Period. 
For pediatric study participants, the 50% responder rates for reduction in days with absence seizures for 
the LCM and placebo groups were each 6.7% (1 of 15) and 20.0% (2 of 10), respectively, during the 
Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and 24-week Treatment Period.  
For adult study participants, the 50% responder rates for reduction in days with absence seizures for the 
LCM and placebo groups were 19.4% and 15.6%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 25.0% and 
12.5%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 25.0% and 15.6%, 
respectively, for the 24-week Treatment Period.  
Responder status for reduction in days with myoclonic seizures 
The 50% responder rates for reduction in days with myoclonic seizures for the LCM and placebo groups 
were 21.3% and 26.5%, respectively, during the Titration Period, 23.4% and 26.5%, respectively, during 
the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and 27.7% and 28.6%, respectively, during the 24-week 
Treatment Period. 
For pediatric study participants, the 50% responder rates for reduction in days with myoclonic seizures 
for the LCM and Placebo groups were each 20.0% (1 of 5) and 14.3% (1 of 7), respectively, during each 
time period. 
For adult study participants, the 50% responder rates for reduction in days with myoclonic seizures for 
the LCM and Placebo groups were 21.4% and 28.6%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 23.8% 
and 28.6%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 28.6% and 31.0%, 
respectively, for the 24-week Treatment Period.  
50% responder rate for reduction of days with PGTCS was higher in LCM treated patients compared to 
placebo during Titration, 12-weeks Treatment and 24-week Treatment periods. Meanwhile, both 50% 
responder rates for reduction of absences and myoclonic seizures were similar between treatment groups 
at all timepoints assessed. It seems that only one out of 15 paediatric patients was 50% responder for 
reduction of days with absence seizures.

PGTCS worsening 
Overall, the percentage of study participants with 50% seizure worsening for PGTCS for the LCM and 
placebo groups were 10.1% and 14.9%, respectively, during the Titration Period; 10.1% and 15.7%, 
respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and 10.1% and 16.5%, respectively, 
during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
For pediatric study participants, the percentage of study participants with 50% seizure worsening for 
PGTCS for the LCM and placebo groups were each 4.2% and 20.0%, respectively, during the Titration 
Period, the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and the 24-week Treatment Period.  
For adult study participants, the percentage of study participants with 50% seizure worsening for PGTCS 
was 11.6% during each time period for the LCM group, and 13.5%, 14.6%, and 15.6%, respectively, 
during the Titration Period, the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and the 24-week Treatment Period 
for the placebo group.  
It is acknowledged that it seems there were no obvious PGTCS worsening in patients treated with LCM 
compared to placebo as described by the MAH. 
However, 6 out of 47 patients with myoclonic seizures treated with LCM experienced an increase in 
number of days with myoclonic seizures during the treatment period compared to prospective baseline in 
contrast to 3 out of 49 patients treated with placebo (Table 8.7.3, CSR). Increase in myoclonic seizure 
frequency compared to prospective baseline was also more common in patients treated with LCM (8 out 
of 47) compared to placebo (5 out of 49) (Table 8.7.3.2, CSR).  
In order to have clearer picture how many patients experienced improvement/worsening of myoclonic 
and absence seicures and magnitude of these changes the MAH is requested to present the waterfall 
figures depicting both change of days and seizure frequency for myoclonic and absence seizures in 
patients treated with LCM and placebo (LoQ). 
Health quality related outcomes 
QOLIE-31-P 
The QOLIE-31-P Version 2 was used to evaluate the health-related quality of life of study participants ≥18 
years of age. 
Mean scores at Baseline for QOLIE 31 P total and subscale score, QOLIE 31 P distress item score, and 
QOLIE 31 P prioritization items score were generally similar between the LCM and placebo groups. 
Small changes in QOLIE 31 P total and subscale scores were observed from Baseline to the Last Visit in 
both the LCM and placebo groups (all changes were <10 points on a 100 point scale). The mean changes 
observed in the LCM group were generally similar to those observed for the placebo group. 
PedsQL 
The PedsQL was used in pediatric study participants <18 years of age. 
Overall, the mean total PedsQL score at Baseline was 76.0 in the LCM group and 80.9 in the placebo 
group. Mean changes in total PedsQL scores from Baseline to Last Visit were 3.0 in the LCM group and -
2.9 in the placebo group. In general, mean changes from Baseline overall and for individual subscale 
scores were small and variable in both the LCM and placebo groups. No worsening in the mean value for 
any score was observed for participants in the LCM group. 
EQ-5D-3L quality of life 
The EQ-5D-3L was only assessed for study participants ≥12 years of age. The scale is scored from 0 
(worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 35/88 
 
  
  
Overall, the mean EQ-5B-3L VAS score at Baseline was 74.6 in the LCM group and 74.3 in the placebo 
group. The mean changes in EQ-5B-3L VAS scores at the Last Visit were 3.6 in the LCM group and 0.9 in 
the placebo group. No worsening was observed. 
No clear effects on improvement of quality of life of patients in treated with LCM were observed. It is 
reassuring that no worsening of quality of life was neither reported.

EP0012 
EP0012 is a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label extension study designed to assess the long-term safety and 
efficacy of LCM as adjunctive therapy for PGTCS in study participants 4 years of age and older with IGE. 
This study enrolls study participants who are Baseline failures as well as those who completed a protocol-
defined endpoint in the SP0982 study. Approximately 250 study participants will be enrolled in EP0012 
and only LCM will be administered in addition to background AEDs.  
EP0012 is an ongoing study. At the time of clinical cut-off, study participants were still enrolling and 
participating in SP0982. 
Pediatric study participants weighing <30kg and ≥30kg to <50kg will start EP0012 on a dose of LCM 
10mg/kg/day and 8mg/kg/day respectively. Adult study participants ≥18 years old and pediatric study 
participants ≥50kg will start the study taking a dose of LCM 400mg/day. Pediatric study participants 
weighing <50kg who are baseline failures from SP0982 will start the study taking a dose of LCM 
2mg/kg/day while the adult study participants ≥18 years of age or pediatric study participants weighing ≥
50kg who are baseline failures will start the study taking a dose of LCM 100mg/day. 
Study participants will be eligible to participate in EP0012 for 5 years with at least a minimum of 2 years. 
The study consists of a Treatment Period, an up to 4-week Taper Period, and a 30-day Safety Follow-Up 
Period. The maximum duration of study drug administration is 242 weeks. 
The primary variables in this study are safety variables only. 
The secondary efficacy variable is the percent change in PGTC seizure frequency (SF) per 28 days from 
Combined Baseline Period.

Results  
As of the clinical cut-off date, a total of 211 study participants were enrolled and started the study. 
Overall, 167 study participants (79.1%), 128 study participants (60.7%), and 66 study participants 
(31.3%) were in the 22 Weeks, 46 Weeks, and 94 Weeks completer cohorts, respectively.

SP0982 (SS) 
Baseline characteristics 
As of the clinical cut-off date for this interim CSR, based on the ILAE seizure classification history from 
SP0982, overall the majority of study participants (210 [99.5%]) had a history of tonic-clonic seizures, 
and 79 study participants (37.4%) and 72 study participants (34.1%) had histories of myoclonic and 
absence seizures, respectively. 
Overall, the mean time since first diagnosis at SP0982 entry was 15.287 years (range: 0.49 to 60.74 
years) and the mean age at epilepsy diagnosis was 13.044 years (range: 0 to 39.76 years). As expected, 
the mean time since first diagnosis and the mean age at epilepsy diagnosis generally increased with 
increasing age cohort.

At EP0012 entry, the majority of study participants were using concomitant AEDs: 68 study participants 
(32.2%) were using 1 concomitant AED, 103 study participants (48.8%) were using 2 concomitant AEDs, 
and 35 study participants (16.5%) were using 3 concomitant AEDs. Study participants were permitted to 
withdraw concomitant AEDs. A total of 5 study participants (2.4%) were not using concomitant AEDs at 
EP0012 entry. The majority of study participants (168 [79.6%]) were not using concomitant 
benzodiazepines at EP0012 entry. 
Percent change from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days by completed cohort and 
Treatment Period (FAS) 
As of the clinical cut-off date for this interim report, overall a median percent change of -84.996% 
(range: -100.000 to 465.353) from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days was observed 
during the Treatment Period.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH applied for the new indication for use of LCM as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary 
generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) aged 4 
years and older. The basis for demonstration of efficacy for the indication extension is the pivotal study 
SP0982 and is in line with the CHMP scientific advice issued on 20 Sep 2012 
(EMEA/H/SA/1570/4/2012/II).  
SP0982 is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study 
designed to assess the efficacy of oral LCM versus placebo as adjunctive therapy for PGTCS in study 
participants ≥4 years of age with IGE, taking 1 to 3 concomitant AEDs independent of the number of 
prior failed AEDs over 24 week treatment period. The pivotal study SP0982 is a measure of the PIP 
EMEA-000402-PIP03-17-M03 and the number of events was agreed to be at least 17.6% of the events 
from the paediatric age group from 4 to less than 18 years of age. 
The time to event as a primary efficacy endpoint (second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment period) 
is recommended as one of the possible primary endpoints in the “Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders” (CHMP/EWP/566/98 Rev.3 2) and is 
acceptable. The key secondary efficacy variables - seizure freedom for PGTCS during the 24-week 
Treatment Period - and the other secondary efficacy variable - the time to the first PGTCS during the 
Treatment Period - are considered support the primary efficacy variable and are acceptable.  
Other seizure related endpoints (PGTCS frequency per 28-days, number of days with seizures per 28 
days, seizure free status, 50% and 75% responders) were considered as exploratory and were used in 
assessment of all generalized seizures - PGTCS, absence and myoclonic seizures.  
The study included a 12-week Historical Baseline and a 4-week prospective baseline period (that 
altogether form the Combined baseline), followed by a 6-week (minimum) to 24-week (maximum) 
Treatment Period, which included a 6-week Titration Period and an 18-week (maximum) Maintenance 
Period. Of the 3 PGTCS minimum required for subjects to enroll, 1 or 2 PGTCS must have occurred in 
the first 8 weeks or the second 4 weeks of Historical baseline, and not more than 1 PGTCS must have 
occurred during the prospective baseline, to ensure adequate baseline seizure assessment.  
It is noted that while primary and secondary endpoints as well other efficacy variables assessing PGTCS 
used Combined Baseline (Historical + Prospective Baseline) for comparison of treatment effect, all other 
seizure related endpoints refer to Prospective Baseline for comparison of treatment effects. Having in 
mind that recognition of absence seizures is more challenging compared to PGTCS, the validity of 
retrospective data on absence seizures could be questionable and the choice of different baselines could 
be acceptable. The MAH stated that myoclonic seizures were anticipated to be more difficult to be 
remembered back from the 12-week Historical Baseline Period. Due to the potential for under-reporting 
of myoclonic seizures with the use of the Historical Baseline, the Prospective Baseline was chosen for 
myoclonic seizures. This potential risk of under reporting is acknowledged. Potentially under-reporting of 
myoclonic seizures during the historical baseline period would result in even higher apparent worsening 
of them during the treatment period. Since worsening of myoclonic seizures is agreed by the MAH and 
proposed to be considered as an adverse event with the relevant information reflected in the Product 
Information, this is acceptable. 
The patient population as defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria is considered acceptable. Both LCM 
and placebo groups were balanced regarding age, sex and ethnicity. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut 
Syndrome (typically presenting with seizures including tonic seizures), some other related syndromes 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 40/88 
 
  
  
like Doose’s syndrome (typically presenting with myoclonic-atonic seizures), or evidence of both focal 
and generalized epilepsy were excluded. The study participants were allowed to have treatment with 1 
to 3 concomitant AEDs. What drugs were mostly used as combinations of 2 or 3 AED were not presented 
and not discussed since it was agreed that the groups would have been very small and therefore not 
relevant for conclusions. 
Patients which received at least 1 dose of study medication are included in the Safety Set analysis. The Full 
Analysis Set (FAS) included patients who had at least one seizure diary assessment during the treatment 
period. The primary efficacy variable was analyzed based on FAS data set. It is noted that 3 patients 
treated with LCM were not included in the FAS data set. The MAH clarified that the reason for not 
including 3 subjects in the FAS data set is due to lack of post-baseline seizure diary, and this was 
considered as an acceptable explanation. 
The statistical methods are considered adequate to the study design. Being a time-to-event study, no 
imputation for missing data was performed. Since PGTCS counts reported as ‘not done’ in the patient diary 
on a specific day were assumed to be zero, there is the need to understand if this has impacted on the 
primary and key secondary endpoint. The MAH has subsequently provided a reassuring low incidence of 
PGTCS counts reported as ‘not done’ on the diaries, which were surprisingly low as compared to the 
number of evaluable days, as well as evenly distributed among treatment groups. 
Of note, the final stratum pooling algorithm used in the primary and secondary efficacy analyses, was 
defined only with SAP amendment 4, implemented close to the date of LPLV (5 Jul 2019). The defined 
three pooled strata were the following: Strata 1: Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days and paediatric; 
Strata 2: Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days and adult; Strata 3: Baseline PGTCS frequency >2 per 28 
days and All (paediatric and adult).  A stratum pooling algorithm was defined in all versions of the SAPs, 
from the original through SAP Amendment 4, and it was clarified that pooling would have been 
implemented in the case that almost no study participants in any single stratum would experience an 
event. Since the number of subjects in the >2 baseline PGTCS per 28 days stratum was only 1 pediatric 
participant with no events (i.e. 2 PGTCS), it was decided to combine paediatric with adult pools.  
Regarding the temporal proximity of SAP amendment 4 implementation to the LPLV date, it has been 
stated that, as already known, it was triggered by an FDA request of a Type C meeting. 
The MAH reaffirmed that the protocol included the use of the randomization strata as covariates in the 
primary and secondary analyses and that, according to CHMP Guidelines randomization, strata were 
attempted to be used as covariates. 
The maintenance of LCM treatment effect over long term period is investigated in the EP0012 study. 
EP0012 is a Phase 3, multi-centre, open-label extension study designed to assess the long-term safety 
and efficacy of LCM as adjunctive therapy for PGTCS in study participants 4 years of age and older with 
IGE. This study enrols study participants who are Baseline failures as well as those who completed a 
protocol-defined endpoint in the SP0982 study. Approximately 250 study participants will be enrolled in 
EP0012 and only LCM will be administered in addition to background AEDs. This study is ongoing. 
No primary efficacy variables are defined for EP0012. The secondary efficacy variable is the percent 
change in PGTC seizure frequency (SF) per 28 days from Combined Baseline Period.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint was achieved, and LCM treatment had statistically significantly lower risk for the 
development of the second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment period compared to placebo.  
It is agreed that subgroup analysis (age, sex, region, baseline PGTCS frequency, number of AEDs) did 
not reveal any major differences in treatment effect, what could most likely be explained by small 
numbers of patients in each subgroup. A very limited number of patients treated with LCM was aged 
<18 years: 8 patients in the ≥4 to <12 years age group (vs 9 in the PBO group), and 16 patients in the 
>12 to <18 years range (same as PBO). These numbers are too small to understand the consequences 
of LCM treatment in paediatric patients with IGEs, considering that most syndromes include also 
myoclonic jerks and absence seizures that peak at different ages compared to GTC seizures and can be 
worsened by a drug acting on Na+ currents.  
Of the 125 total events analysed for the primary efficacy variable analysis, 102 (81.6%) were observed 
in the adult group (62 in PBO and 40 in LCM group) and 23 events (18.4%) were observed in paediatric 
group (9 in LCM group and 14 in PBO group). Although numbers are too low to draw sound conclusions, 
it is of note that when looking at treatment effect across the 3 age groups (the 3 paediatric groups and 
the adult one) the risk to develop a second PGTCS was highest in the > 12 to 18 age group when, 
according to natural history, PGTCS are more likely to peak.  
Patients with the most common IGE syndromes (i.e. childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence 
epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening) may 
experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The MAH provided the information regarding different 
epilepsy diagnosis included into the SP0982 study, however, results in these subgroups were not 
presented.  Although the sample sizes for many of the epileptic syndromes subtypes by which the 
subgroup analyses were requested turned out to be small to draw conclusions, it is acknowledged that 
they were directionally consistent with the primary analysis with hazard ratios generally favoring LCM 
over placebo, and ranging from 0.106 (childhood absence epilepsy) to 0.904 (juvenile absence 
epilepsy). 
The MAH provided the information regarding different epilepsy syndromes included into the SP0982 
study. Rather unexpectedly, the majority of paediatric participants (63.3% overall) were classified as 
‘Other generalized idiopathic epilepsies not defined’, with a predominance in the LCM group compared 
with PBO group (17 [70.8%] vs 14 [56.0%], respectively).  The MAH explained the difficulty that can be 
encountered trying to categorize the type of IGE into a specific epileptic syndrome, as demonstrated by 
the evolution of the natural history of Juvenile Absence Epilepsy potentially evolving into PGTCS, or JME 
that evolve into an almost myoclonic-free picture later on in adulthood.  
However, as the sought extended indication includes the treatment of PGTCS in drug-resistant subjects 
with IGE from 4 years of age, per definition this category includes generalized idiopatic epilepsies which 
cannot be regarded as none among Benign neonatal familial convulsions/Benign neonatal 
convulsions/Benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy/Childhood absence epilepsy/Juvenile absence 
epilepsy/Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. For this reason, a smaller proportion of subjects falling into this 
category was expected in the adult subject population, for which a clearer categorization could be ruled 
out.  The reasons for the uncertainties described by the MAH can be more satisfactorily acknowledged 
for the paediatric population compared with the adults. In study SP0982 the most commonly classified 
syndrome was ‘Other generalized idiopathic epilepsies not defined’ in adult study participants (40.3% 
overall), as well as in paediatric participants (63.3% overall). 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint seizure freedom for PGTCS during 24-week period supported the 
favourable effect of LCM treatment compared to placebo. The stratified KM estimate of the proportion of 
study participants who were seizure free at Day 166 was 31.3% (95% CI: 22.8%, 39.9%) in the LCM group 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 42/88 
 
  
  
and 17.2% (95% CI: 10.4%, 24.0%) in the placebo group. The difference was even more obvious in strata 
with baseline PGTCS frequency >2 seizures per 28 days (30.0% for the LCM group and 4.9% for the placebo 
group). The MAH specified that 7 paediatric study participants were included in stratum 3 (< 2 seizures), 
none whom was seizure-free by Day 166, whereas only adult participants in this stratum met seizure 
freedom. The similar difference was observed also following stratification of paediatric and adult patients 
in the strata with Baseline PGTCS frequency ≤2 per 28 days.  
The secondary efficacy variable of time to first PGTCS was also in favour of LCM compared to placebo 
supporting the positive effect on PGTCS. The median time to first PGTCS was 36.0 days (95% CI: 25.0, 
78.0) for the LCM group and 20.0 days (95% CI: 13.0, 34.0) for the placebo group. 
The median PGTCS frequency per 28 days was rather low at the combined baseline period. The 
reduction of median PGTCS frequency from Combined Baseline per 28 days was highest at 24-week 
Treatment Period and similar between children and adults. Of note, the median PGTCS frequency per 28 
days was rather low at the combined baseline period, for both LCM and PBO groups (1.25 and 1.24, 
respectively) and significantly lower than the corresponding mean value (1.88 and 2.02, respectively). 
The distribution is thus skewed to the right indicating that the scores fall toward the lower side of the 
frequency scale. Moreover, baseline LCM values are lower compared to PBO and differences are 
observed between SD values (1.76 vs 2.42). It is thus questionable if the assumption that the 
probability to develop a second seizure is similar in the two arms is soundly demonstrated by data. The 
magnitude of treatment effect on the primary endpoint could have been thus overestimated. 
Number of patients with juvenile absence seizures was rather high in LCM group (40.5%) and in placebo 
group (33.9%). However, the number of days with absence seizures was relatively low during the 
Prospective Baseline period in both treatment groups. The LCM treatment reduced frequency of days 
with absence seizures at higher degree compared to placebo, especially in paediatric population.  
The median number of days with myoclonic seizures during Prospective Baseline was slightly higher in 
LCM group compared to placebo.  As regards myoclonic seizures, 9 subjects of whom 6 in LCM showed 
worsening in days with seizures, whereas 13 subjects of whom 8 in LCM had an increase in seizure 
frequency. Conversely, as regards absence seizure worsening, of the 12 subjects who reported increase 
in days with seizures 9 were in placebo, whereas of the 15 subjects with increased absence seizure 
frequency 6 were in LCM. The incidence of myoclonic seizure emergence or worsening was higher in the 
titration period, however, it was more clustered within the first 4 weeks since randomization in placebo 
group (10/13 events) and was more interspersed over time in LCM group (13/27 in the first 4-week 
period since randomization then 4/27 in the two following 4-week blocks, 2/27 in both the >12 to ≤16 
and >16 to ≤20 and 2 in the >24 week period. Although the MAH has reiterated how fickle and unstable 
the occurrence of myoclonic seizures can be (also through the 4 subjects illustrated by way of example), 
it is undeniable that the design of the study and the randomization applied is expected to evenly 
distribute variables among treatment groups. Therefore, the overall interpretation of these data is that 
there is a clear trend towards worsening of myoclonic seizures with LCM (see also Clinical safety 
section). 
The 50% responder rate for reduction of days with PGTCS was higher in LCM treated patients compared to 
placebo during Titration, 12-weeks Treatment and 24-week Treatment periods. Meanwhile, both 50% 
responder rates for reduction of absences and myoclonic seizures were similar between treatment groups 
at all timepoints assessed.  
It is acknowledged that it appears there were no obvious PGTCS worsening in patients treated with LCM 
compared to placebo as described by the MAH. However, 6 out of 47 patients with myoclonic seizures 
treated with LCM experienced an increase in number of days with myoclonic seizures during the 
treatment period compared to prospective baseline in contrast to 3 out of 49 patients treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 43/88 
 
  
  
placebo. Increase in myoclonic seizure frequency compared to prospective baseline was also more 
common in patients treated with LCM (8 out of 47) compared to placebo (5 out of 49).  
No clear effects on improvement of quality of life of patients treated with LCM were observed. Since 
positive effect on PGTCS was not followed by the same trend for myoclonic seizures, it is reassuring that 
no worsening of quality of life was neither reported. 
The long-term effects of LCM treatment on PGTCS was assessed in the EP0012 study. The total 
discontinuation rate (17.1%) in EP0012 study was rather similar to the one in the SP0982 study (14,9% 
LCM group). However, the main reason for discontinuation in the LCM group in the SP0982 study were 
adverse events (8.3%) while lack of efficacy was reported only by one patient (0.8%). This observation 
is contrasting to the EP0012 study where lack of efficacy as one of reasons for discontinuation was 
reported by 5.2% percent of patients (n=11). Possibly this might reflect longer study duration. On the 
other hand, it also indicates that long term efficacy will be reported in preselected population responding 
to the treatment. 
The median percent changes from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency per 28 days observed in the 
LCM group during the Titration Period (-66.37%), first 12 weeks (-71.33%), and 24-week Treatment 
Period (-77.92%) in the SP0982 study. Similar changes in percent change from Combined Baseline in 
PGTCS frequency per 28 days were reported at least until week 94 in EP0012 study - median percent 
changes from Combined Baseline in PGTCS frequency in the 0 to 22 Weeks, 0 to 46 Weeks, and 0 to 94 
Weeks completer cohorts were -87.0, -83.3, and -84.6, respectively. Taking all these considerations into 
account, it appears that in the open-label EP0012 study LCM treatment has similar long-term effect on 
the frequency of the PGTCS as reported in the 24-week controlled trial, but definite conclusions is 
difficult to draw due to the open-label nature of the trial and potential selection bias. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Only 49 paediatric patients were included into the SP0982 study, including 24 of them on LCM 
treatment. However, the number of events registered during study was higher compared to the one 
agreed with the PDCO (at least 17.6% of the events from the paediatric age group from 4 to less than 
18 years of age). There were only 8 patients younger than 12 years old exposed to LCM treatment. It is 
noted that the 2nd substantial amendment allowed inclusion of paediatric study participants (≥4 to 12 
years of age).  
In general, the effect of LCM treatment in paediatric patients was similar to the one described in adults. 
Furthermore, the risk for second PGTCS was lower in the youngest children group (2 out of 8, 75%) 
compared to adults (40 out of 94, 54%). In general, the LCM treatment effect in paediatric patients 
seems to have similar effect as in adults as assessed by other endpoints like PGTCS frequency and 50% 
responders’ rate. On the other hand, the PGTCS free status was achieved by substantially smaller 
proportion of paediatric patients and compared to adults (13.0% vs 31.4%, respectively). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the review of all information provided, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy of the use of 
Lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) 
in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) aged 4 years and older is proven.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of LCM has previously been investigated in adult and paediatric (adolescents and 
children from 4 years of age) patients with POS. Based on data with LCM as adjunctive therapy, the most 
common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in adults were related to the CNS and gastrointestinal system 
and included dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia. In monotherapy studies in adult patients with 
POS, the most frequently reported adverse reactions observed with LCM were headache and dizziness. 
Dizziness was the most common reason for LCM treatment discontinuation. The paediatric safety profile 
of LCM was generally found to be consistent, with ADRs mainly related to the CNS (e.g. dizziness, and 
somnolence) and gastrointestinal system (e.g. vomiting). 
The main safety data for the current application originates from the pivotal study SP0982, together with 
interim results from the ongoing open-label extension study EP0012. Safety data from the completed 
Phase 2 open-label pilot study (SP0961) and its extension (SP0962) were also provided. In addition, 2 
safety pools were defined: 
- Pool SGTC-1: all participants receiving at least one dose of LCM in either the SP0982 or EP0012 studies.  
- Pool SGTC-2: all participants receiving at least one dose of LCM in either the SP0961 or SP0962 studies. 
To evaluate differences in the LCM safety profile between paediatric and adult study participants in the 
PGTCS and POS populations, the incidence of the most common treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) (occurring in ≥2% of patients) from Pool SGTC-1 were presented side-by-side with previously 
pooled data from adult and paediatric patients with POS (Pool S2 and Pool SPX-1, respectively).  
Pool S2 (completed studies SP667, SP754, SP755, SP607, SP615, SP756, and SP774) was previously 
submitted to support the initial LCM adjunctive therapy submission in adults with POS and Pool SPX-1 
(SP847 [completed], SP848 and EP0034 [then ongoing with a cut-off date of 01 Nov 2016]) was 
previously submitted to support the LCM paediatric submission in study participants 4 to <16 years of age 
with POS.

Overall, the safety set included 242 study participants, including 121 each in the LCM and Placebo 
groups, respectively. A total of 213 study participants (88.0%) completed the study (103 [85.1%] in the 
LCM group and 110 [90.9%] in the placebo group). Of the paediatric study participants (<18 years of 
age), a total of 8 (6.6%) in the LCM group and 9 (7.4%) in the placebo group were ≥4 to <12 years of 
age, and 16 study participants (13.2%) in each group were ≥12 to <18 years of age. In total, there were 
2 study participants (0.8%) who were ≥65 years of age, 1 in the LCM group and 1 in the placebo group.  
In the pivotal study SP0982, LCM (N=121) and Placebo (N=121) patients were exposed for a total of 37.2 
and 31.1 study participant-years, respectively. During the 6-week Titration Period, median study 
medication duration was similar between the LCM and Placebo groups (42.0 days each). During the 
Maintenance Period, median duration of exposure was also similar, 126.0 days (range: 13.0 to 135.0 
days) in the LCM group and 120.5 days (range: 3.0 to 134.0 days) in the Placebo group.  
Overall, median study medication duration was 143.0 days (range: 1.0 to 176.0 days) in the LCM group 
and 65.0 days (range: 7.0 to 176.0 days) in the Placebo group.

In the Titration Period and Maintenance Period, median duration of exposure was similar between the 
respective LCM and Placebo groups. However, only 70 of 121 patients in the Placebo group continued to 
the Maintenance Period as compared to 82 in the LCM group, resulting in lower overall median exposure 
in the Placebo group (65.0 days) compared to LCM (143.0 days) when both periods were combined. The 
applicant provided some supplemental safety tables that adjust for exposure.  
For the open-label extension study EP0012, as of the clinical cut-off date (28 Nov 2018) for the interim 
CSR, 211 study participants (100%) were exposed to LCM, for a total of 277.86 study participant-years.  
In Pool SGTC-1 (studies SP0982 and EP0012 combined up to the cut-off date), 255 study participants 
were exposed to LCM for a total of 330.51 study participant-years (see table below). 
Table 13:  
Pool SGTC-1 exposure to LCM over time 
A summary of exposure by dose is provided in the table below. In all study participants, the median 
modal dose (mg/day) was 400 mg (range: 100 mg to 800 mg), and the median maximum dose (mg/day) 
was 400 mg/day (range: 100 mg to 800 mg). 
In Pool SGTC-1, as of the clinical cut-off date, a total of 255 subjects were exposed to LCM for a total of 
330.51 subject-years, of whom 50 were in the paediatric age and 205 in the adult age category, with 
64.97 and 265.54 subject-years exposure, respectively. A total of 147 subjects (57.6%) were exposed for 
≥12 months of whom only 28 subjects (56%) were in the paediatric age for a total exposure of 53.83 
subject-years, compared with 119 adult subjects (58%) who were exposed to LCM for 232.46 subject-
years.   
In comparison, in Pool SPX-1, including safety data of the paediatric patient population with POS exposed 
to LCM in the open-label studies SP847, SP848, or EP0034, 120 subjects (39.6%) were exposed to LCM 
for at least 12 months, with a total exposure of 194.1 subject-years.  
The number and exposure of the paediatric population with PGTCS is thus limited. The MAH was 
requested to provide tabulated data on exposure and disposition by age and weight band. In particular, 
given the reported differences in the literature, in the predominant seizure pattern and age of onset of 
IGE syndromes, with almost doubled onset in the 12-17 years age group compared to 5-11 years group.

The ≥4 to <12 years age group had lower percentages of study participants exposed to LCM for ≥18, 
≥24, and ≥30 months compared with the ≥12 to <16 years age group (33.3%, 13.3%, and 6.7% vs. 
60.0, 53.3%, and 33.3%, respectively). No study participants in the ≥4 to <12 years age group were 
exposed to LCM for ≥36 months compared with 2 study participants in the ≥12 to <16 years age group 
(13.3%). Similarly, the <30kg weight band group had a lower percentage of study participants exposed 
to LCM for ≥18 months compared with the ≥30 to <50kg weight band (16.7% vs. 54.5%). No study 
participants in the <30kg weight band group were exposed to LCM for ≥24 months compared with 4 
study participants in the ≥30 to <50kg weight band group (36.4%).

In study EP0012, investigators were allowed to increase or decrease the dose of LCM to optimize 
tolerability and seizure reduction. As of the clinical cut-off date, 9 adult study participants were exposed 
to LCM≥800mg/day at least once during the Treatment Period. And 3 paediatric study participants were 
exposed to LCM≥600mg/day (tablet formulation) during the Treatment Period, as shown by the 
maximum ranges in this table. 
In Pool SGTC-2, a total of 49 study participants were exposed to LCM for a total of 45.94 study 
participant-years. A total of 37 study participants (75.5%) were exposed for ≥6 months, 33 (67.3%) 
were exposed for ≥12 months, and 1 (2.0%) was exposed for ≥18 months. Overall, the median duration

of LCM exposure was 1.248 years (range:0 to 1.38 years). The median modal dose (mg/day) was 400 mg 
(range: 50 mg to 800 mg), and the median maximum dose was 500 mg/day (range: 50 mg to 800 mg). 
Adverse events 
Common adverse events 
Study SP0982 
The most common TEAEs (≥3% of study participants in the LCM or Placebo group) are summarized in the 
following table:

In the LCM group, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders 
(58 study participants [47.9%]), and Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders (25 study 
participants [20.7%] each). By PT, the most common TEAEs were dizziness (28 study participants 
[23.1%]), somnolence (20 [16.5%]), and headache (17 [14.0%]). 
In the Placebo group, TEAEs were also most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders 
(36 study participants [29.8%]), Infections and infestations (23 study participants [19.0%]), and 
Gastrointestinal disorders (19 [15.7%]). By PT, the most common TEAEs were somnolence (17 [14.0%]), 
headache (12 [9.9%]), and nausea and dizziness (7 [5.8%] each).  
For the LCM group, TEAEs were reported more frequently in the Titration Period as compared with the 
Maintenance Period (79 of 121 study participants [65.3%] vs. 44 of 82 [53.7%], respectively) but were 
reported with similar frequency in these periods for the Placebo group (67 of 121 study participants 
[55.4%] vs 39 of 70 [55.7%], respectively).  
The most common TEAEs (≥3% of study participants in the LCM or Placebo group) adjusted for exposure 
are summarized for the paediatric and adult patient groups, respectively, in the table below.

Table 18: Most common TEAEs (≥3% of pts) per 100 pt-months in study SP0982 (safety set) 
Irrespective of age, a notably different incidence rate (>2.00 per 100 person-months difference) between 
the LCM and placebo groups was observed for the TEAE of dizziness (6.76 vs 3.27, respectively). 
In the LCM group, notably different incidence rates (>2.00 difference) between paediatric and adult study 
participants were observed for the TEAEs of somnolence (5.94 vs 2.84, respectively) and dizziness (5.19 
vs 7.22, respectively). 
In the placebo group, notably different incidence rates (>2.00 difference) between paediatric and adult 
study participants were observed for the TEAEs of upper respiratory tract infection (5.10 vs 1.74) and 
somnolence (1.70 vs 5.46). 
Exposure-duration adjusted incidence rate for dizziness was higher for adult than for paediatric patients 
although the comparative differences to placebo were similar. Paediatric patients in the LCM group 
showed higher rates of somnolence over placebo (5.94 vs. 1.70) as compared to adult patients (2.84 vs. 
5.46, respectively).

Severity and relatedness of TEAEs 
The majority of TEAEs in both groups were mild (62.8% and 61.2%, respectively) or moderate (34.7% 
and 19.0%, respectively). Severe TEAEs were reported for 6 study participants (5.0%) in the LCM group 
compared with 3 study participants (2.5%) in the Placebo group. Most severe events were non-serious. 
Severe TEAEs in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders and Gastrointestinal disorders were exclusively 
reported in the LCM group (4 patients [3.3%] and 2 patients [1.7%], respectively).  
The incidence of study participants reporting related TEAEs as per the investigator was higher in the LCM 
group (56 study participants [46.3%]) compared with the Placebo group (42 [34.7%]). In the LCM group, 
the most common related TEAEs were dizziness (21 study participants [17.4%]), somnolence (16 
[13.2%]), and nausea (9 [7.4%]). In the Placebo group, the most common related TEAEs were 
somnolence (14 study participants [11.6%]), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased and dizziness 
(4 [3.3%] each), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, fatigue, and nausea (3 [2.5%] each). 
The incidence of related TEAEs was higher in the LCM group compared with the Placebo group in both the 
paediatric (45.8% vs 16.0%, respectively) and adult (46.4% vs 39.6%, respectively) categories.  
TEAEs by age 
In the ≥4 to <12 years (n=17), ≥12 to <18 years (n=32), and ≥18 to <65 years (n=191) age categories, 
52.9%, 87.5%, and 71.7% of study participants, respectively, reported any TEAEs during the study.  
In the ≥4 to <12 years (n=17) age category, the most common TEAEs by SOC were Infections and 
infestations (6 study participants [35.3%]) and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, Nervous 
System Disorders, and Psychiatric Disorders (2 [11.8%] each). By PT, the most common TEAE was 
influenza (2 study participants [11.8%]); no other TEAE was reported by >1 study participant.  
In the ≥12 to <18 years (n=32) age category, the most common TEAEs by SOC were Nervous system 
disorders (16 study participants [50.0%]), Infections and infestations (11 [34.4%]), and Gastrointestinal 
disorders (9 study participants [28.1%]). By PT, the most common TEAEs were dizziness and somnolence 
(7 study participants [21.9%] each) and headache and upper respiratory tract infection (4 [12.5%] 
each).  
In the ≥18 to <65 years (n=191) age category, the most common TEAEs by SOC were Nervous System 
Disorders (75 study participants [39.3%]), Gastrointestinal disorders (35 study participants [18.3%]), 
and Infections and infestations (31 study participants [16.2%]). By PT, the most common TEAEs were 
somnolence (29 study participants [15.2%]), dizziness (26 study participants [13.6%]), and headache 
(24 study participants [12.6%]).  
In the ≥65 years age category (n=2), no TEAEs (by SOC or PT) were reported by >1 study participant.  
Serious TEAEs were reported by 0%, 6.3%, and 5.2% of study participants in the ≥4 to <12 years, ≥12 
to <18 years, and ≥18 to <65 years age categories, respectively. Treatment-emergent AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported by 0%, 3.1%, and 7.3% of study participants in the ≥4 to <12 years, ≥12 
to <18 years, and ≥18 to <65 years age categories, respectively. There were no SAEs in the ≥65 years 
age category.  
Severe TEAEs were reported by 0%, 6.3%, and 3.1% of study participants in the ≥4 to <12 years, ≥12 
to <18 years, and ≥18 to <65 years age categories, respectively. There were 2 study participants in the 
≥65 years age category (n=1 each in the LCM and Placebo groups). 
In the paediatric category, related TEAEs reported by ≥5% of study participants in either the LCM (n=24) 
or placebo (n=25) group included dizziness (25.0% and 0%, respectively), somnolence (20.8% and 
4.0%, respectively), and headache and  nausea (8.3% and 0%, respectively, each). In the adult 
category, related TEAEs reported by ≥5% of study participants in either the LCM (n=97) or placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 52/88 
 
  
  
(n=96) group included dizziness (15.5% and 4.2%, respectively), somnolence (11.3% and 13.5%, 
respectively), vertigo (7.2% and 2.1%, respectively), nausea (7.2% and 3.1%, respectively), vomiting 
(5.2% and 0%, respectively), and fatigue (5.2% and 2.1%, respectively). 
Incidence of TEAEs by actual dose at TEAE onset 
Overall, 111 study participants each in the LCM and Placebo groups took tablets at any dose. For tablets, 
the incidence of TEAEs among study participants taking Placebo (n=111), LCM>0 to <200mg/day 
(n=111), LCM ≥200 to <400mg/day (n=106), and LCM ≥400 to <600mg/day (n=97) at TEAE onset was 
66.7%, 31.5%, 42.5%, and 56.7%, respectively. Ten study participants each in the LCM and Placebo 
groups took oral solution at any dose. For oral solution, the incidences of TEAEs among study participants 
taking Placebo (n=10), LCM >0 to <4mg/kg/day (n=7), LCM ≥4 to <8mg/kg/day (n=10), and LCM 
≥8mg/kg/day (n=9) at TEAE onset were 50.0%, 14.3%, 60.0%, and 44.4%, respectively.  
As expected, slight dose-related trends could be observed for TEAEs related to nervous system disorders 
(dizziness, somnolence) and vertigo.  
Study EP0012 
A summary of TEAEs by baseline age in the feeder study, SP0982, is shown in the table below.  
Table 19: Overview of TEAEs in study EP0012 (safety set) 
As of the clinical cut-off date for the interim CSR, the most frequently reported TEAEs (PT) per 100 
person-months were: nasopharyngitis (35 study participants [16.6%]), with a rate of 0.97 person-
months; headache (34 study participants [16.1%]), 0.94 person-months; dizziness (32 [15.2%]), 0.88 
person-months; somnolence (22 [10.4%]), 0.61 person-months; upper respiratory tract infection (14 
[6.6%]), 0.39 person-months; and contusion and nausea (13 [6.2%] each), 0.36 person-months each. 
Comparison of TEAEs for PGTCS vs. POS populations 
A side-by-side presentation of common TEAEs between Pool SGTC-1 as compared to two previously 
submitted data pools for the adult and paediatric POS populations, respectively, is shown below.

To further contextualize the safety profile for the PGTCS population, the MAH provided a side-by-side 
presentation of common TEAEs between Pool SGTC-1 as compared to two data pools for the adult and 
paediatric POS populations, respectively. Overall, given the differences in underlying epileptic conditions 
(PGTCS vs. POS) and considering differences in dataset sizes that may explain some of the fluctuations, 
the common TEAE pattern seems to be broadly similar between the indications and for both populations. 
However, some differences in the frequencies of TEAEs were observed; a slightly higher incidence of 
TEAEs were observed in PGTCS compared with POS (82.0 vs 73.5%, respectively).  
A summary table with further division by age is shown below. Generally, the incidence of somnolence was 
higher for all age groups in PGTCS compared with POS. This difference is not explained by concomitant 
intake of other AEDs in PCTCS patients; paediatric patients in the LCM group showed higher rates of 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 55/88 
 
  
  
 
 
somnolence over placebo (5.94 vs. 1.70 per 100 pt-months), which was not observed in adult patient. 
Thus, this may indicate that especially paediatric patients with PGTCS are more at risk for this ADR.  
Also, paediatric patients with PGTCS experienced contusions, head injury, and falls much more frequently 
than both paediatric patients with POS and adult with PGTCS (12% vs 2.7% vs 5.4%; 6% vs 1.2% vs 
3.4%, and 4% vs 1.7% vs 2%, respectively). The difference cannot be ascribed to the occurrence of 
dizziness, as this TEAE was more common in adults compared to paediatric patients (7.22/100 
participants-month vs 5.19/100 participants-month, respectively). Rather, it may indicate differences in 
the predominant seizure pattern of epileptic syndromes between children and adults with primary 
generalized epilepsy. However, quite unexpectedly, given the high prevalence in children with primary 
generalized epilepsy, no myoclonic epilepsy has been listed among TEAEs in the paediatric population, 
while a frequency of 3.9% was recorded in adult patients. More in general, as discussed below in this AR, 
the MAH was requested to provide more information on the adjudication of epilepsy events as TEAEs. 
The issue of worsening of seizures is further discussed below.

Pool SGTC-2 
Overall, TEAEs were reported by 47 study participants (95.9%) in Pool SGTC-2. The most common TEAEs 
were dizziness (22 study participants [44.9%]), nausea (15 study participants [30.6%]), upper 
respiratory tract infection (12 study participants [24.5%]), and headache (12 study participants 
[24.5%]). 
AEs of special interest 
Data related to seizures 
Study SP0982 
As compared to the 16-week Combined Baseline period (i.e., the 12-week Historical Baseline plus the 4-
week Prospective Baseline), new seizure types that were reported during the Treatment Period included 
absence seizures (1 study participant [0.8%] in the LCM group and 0 in the placebo group), myoclonic 
seizures (6 study participants [5.0%] in the LCM group and 4 [3.3%] in the placebo group), and 
unclassified epileptic seizures (2 study participants [1.7%] in the LCM group and 0 in the placebo group). 
When considering both Combined Baseline as well as seizure history, new seizure types reported during 
the Treatment Period included myoclonic seizures (1 study participant [0.8%] in the LCM group and 1 
[0.8%] in the placebo group), and unclassified epileptic seizures (1 study participant [0.8%] in the LCM 
group and 0 in the placebo group). 
Absence seizures 
A total of 93 study participants (LCM, n=51; placebo, n=42) experienced absence seizures during the 
Prospective Baseline. Greater percent changes from Prospective Baseline in median days with absence 
seizures were observed in the LCM group compared with the placebo group during the Titration Period 
(-24.6% and-11.1%, respectively), first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period (-30.4% and -13.3%, 
respectively), and 24-week Treatment Period (-30.1% and -15.3%, respectively). 
This was the case for both the adult and paediatric populations. For paediatric participants, the median 
percent change in days with absence seizures from Prospective Baseline during the 24-week Treatment 
Period was -51.8% for paediatric study participants in the LCM group and -44.6% in the Placebo group.   
Assessment report

Myoclonic seizures 
A total of 96 study participants (LCM, n=47; placebo, n=49) experienced myoclonic seizures during the 
Prospective Baseline. 
The percent changes from Prospective Baseline in median number of days with myoclonic seizures for the 
LCM and placebo groups were -32.5% and -51.8%, respectively, during the Titration period; -43.8% and 
-65.7%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period; and -54.6% and -65.7%, 
respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Summaries of seizure worsening (defined as a study participant experiencing ≥50% increase in the 
number of days with absence or myoclonic seizures per 28 days from Prospective Baseline) for absence 
seizures and myoclonic seizures are provided in the table below.  
Table 2  Seizure worsening for days with absence seizures and myoclonic seizures as 
compared to Prospective Baseline in study SP0982 (safety set) 
For myoclonic seizures, the percentage of study participants with 50% seizure worsening for days with 
myoclonic seizures for the LCM and Placebo groups was 8.5% (4 of 47) and 4.1% (2 of 49), respectively, 
each during the Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and 24-week Treatment Period. 
For paediatric study participants, the percentage of study participants in the LCM group with 50% 
worsening was 20% (1 of 5) each during the Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, and 
during the 24-week Treatment Period. No paediatric study participants in the Placebo group had 50%

worsening during the Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, or 24-week Treatment 
Period. 
Onset of myoclonic seizures or worsening in days of myoclonic seizures 
A total of 21 study participants experienced onset of myoclonic seizure or ≥50% worsening in days of 
myoclonic seizures, of which 14 study participants were in the LCM group and 7 were in the Placebo 
group. Study participants in the LCM group included 8 males and 6 females of 13 to 53 years of age.  
Six study participants out of the 14 had a medical history of absence and myoclonic seizures, 7 study 
participants reported a medical history of myoclonic seizure only, and one study participant had no 
history of absence or myoclonic seizure. Among the 13 study participants with a medical history of 
myoclonic seizure at baseline, 8 reported ≥50% worsening in days of myoclonic seizures compared to the 
Baseline Period in at least one Treatment Period and 5 study participants had an occurrence of a new 
myoclonic seizure in the treatment period that was not reported in the Combined Baseline Period of 
SP0982. The remaining study participant, who reported no myoclonic seizure history, experienced an 
emergent myoclonic epilepsy. 
TEAEs related to epilepsy 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of relevance to the PGTCS population (per medical review) were: 
status epilepticus (1 adult study participant taking 50mg LCM), grand mal convulsion (4 adult study 
participants; 3 taking LCM [200mg, 250mg, and 400mg] and 1 taking placebo), and myoclonus (1 adult 
study participant taking 300mg LCM). 
Brief narratives of these cases follow below.  
One event of status epilepticus was reported during the Treatment Period: 
•  A ≥30 to <40-year-old study participant in the LCM group reported a serious TEAE of generalized status epilepticus 
during the Titration Period. The LCM dose at onset was 50 mg/day, and the study participant received this dose for 
1 day prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 10, was severe in intensity, was considered related per the 
investigator, and led to discontinuation of IMP. The event resolved after 3 days. The study participant was 
hospitalized and received intubation, arterial blood gas sampling, computed tomography scan, chest x-ray, ECG, 
drug monitoring, and other laboratory tests as needed. The study participant was treated with ceftriaxone, sodium 
chloride, suxamethonium chloride, and vecuronium during the time of the event. Concomitant AEDs used by the 
study participant included lamotrigine, levetiracetam, etomidate, lorazepam, midazolam hydrochloride, propofol, 
and phenytoin. 
Three events of grand mal convulsion were reported during the Treatment Period, and 1 event was 
reported during the Post-Treatment Period: 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant in the LCM group  reported a serious TEAE of grand mal convulsion 
during the Titration Period. The LCM dose at onset was 250 mg/day, and the study participant received this dose 
for 1 day prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 30, was mild in intensity, was considered not related 
per the investigator, and did not lead to discontinuation of IMP. The event was intermittent and resolved after 2 
days. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included lamotrigine and levetiracetam. 
•  A ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant in the Placebo group  reported a nonserious TEAE of grand mal convulsion 
during the Treatment Period. The LCM dose at onset was 400 mg/day, and the study participant received this dose 
for 90 days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 111, was moderate in intensity, was considered 
related per the investigator, and did not lead to discontinuation of IMP. The event was continuous and did not 
resolve during the study. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included levetiracetam. 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant in the LCM group reported a serious TEAE of grand mal convulsion during 
the Taper Period. In the days prior to the event the study participant had received LCM at a dose of 400 mg/day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021

The event began on Day 45, was severe in intensity, and was considered not related per the investigator. The 
event was intermittent and resolved after 11 days. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included 
valproic acid. 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant in the LCM group  reported a nonserious TEAE of grand mal convulsion 
during the Post-Treatment (Taper) Period. The LCM dose at onset was 200 mg/day, and the study participant 
received this dose for 23 days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day +8, was severe in intensity and 
was considered related per the investigator. The event was intermittent and resolved after 1 day. Concomitant 
AEDs used by the study participant included levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and gabapentin. 
One event coded as myoclonus was reported during the Treatment Period: 
•  A ≥30 to <40-year-old study participant in the Placebo group reported a nonserious TEAE of myoclonus during the 
Maintenance Period. The LCM dose at onset was 300mg/day, and the study participant received this dose for 22 
days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 62, was mild in intensity, was considered related per the 
investigator, and did not lead to discontinuation of IMP. The event was intermittent and did not resolve during the 
study. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included valproate sodium and clonazepam 
Also, 3 study participants (2.5%) in the LCM group reported 3 TEAEs of myoclonic epilepsy during 
treatment (the Titration Period) as compared with 0 study participants in the Placebo group. None of the 
TEAEs were serious. 
•  A ≥30 to <40-year-old study participant reported a TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy (verbatim: increase seizures 
[myoclonic]) during the Titration Period. The LCM dose at onset was 400 mg/day, and the study participant 
received this dose for 14 days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 35, was moderate in intensity, and 
was considered related per the investigator. The event was intermittent, did not lead to discontinuation of IMP, and 
had resolved after 3 days. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included clonazepam, levetiracetam, 
and topiramate. 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant reported a TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy (verbatim: worsening of myoclonic 
seizure) during the Titration Period. The LCM dose at onset was 100 mg/day, and the study participant received 
this dose for 15 days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 15, was moderate in intensity, and was 
considered related per the investigator. The event was intermittent, led to discontinuation of IMP, and had not 
resolved at the end of the study. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included perampanel. 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant reported a TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy (verbatim: myoclonic seizure) 
during the Titration Period. The LCM dose at onset was 200 mg/day, and the study participant received this dose 
for 4 days prior to the event onset. The event began on Day 11, was mild in intensity, and was not considered 
related per the investigator. The event was intermittent, did not lead to discontinuation of IMP, and had not 
resolved at the end of the study. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included lamotrigine and 
retigabine. 
In addition, 1 study participant in the LCM group reported a TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy during the Post-
Treatment (Transition) Period: 
•  An ≥18 to <30-year-old study participant reported a TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy (verbatim: worsening of myoclonic 
seizures). The LCM dose at onset was 400 mg/day, and the study participant received this dose for 8 days prior to 
the event onset. The event began on Day 69, was nonserious, was mild in intensity, and was not considered related 
per the investigator. The event was intermittent, did not lead to discontinuation of IMP, and had not resolved at the 
end of the study. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant included levetiracetam.

Even in cases considered not causally related by the investigator, a causal relationship cannot be 
excluded. For example, subject had no documented medical history of myoclonic seizures according to 
the demographic data listing. Also, there may have been a degree of underreporting of TEAEs; as is 
stated earlier, among the 13 LCM study participants in this study with a medical history of myoclonic 
seizure at baseline, 8 reported ≥50% worsening in days of myoclonic seizures compared to the Baseline 
Period in at least one Treatment Period. In this regard, although the investigator was to review any self-
assessment procedures (eg, the seizure diary) employed in the study, the number of cases that resulted 
in TEAEs being reported seems to be low.

Myoclonic epilepsy was proposed as a new ADR for LCM in patients with PGTCS by the MAH and this is 
endorsed. However, it was considered that a warning also needed to be included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC, stating that new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in patients with 
PGTCS.  
Study EP0012 
Absence seizures 
A total of 11 study participants (5.2%) reported new absence seizures during the Treatment Period as 
compared with Combined Baseline, compared with 164 study participants (77.7%) who did not report 
new seizures.  
One study participant (0.5%) reported new absence seizures during the Treatment Period (as compared 
with seizure history and/or Combined Baseline), compared with 137 study participants (64.9%) who did 
not report new absence seizures.  
Myoclonic seizures 
A total of 12 study participants (5.7%) reported new myoclonic seizures during the Treatment Period as 
compared with Combined Baseline, compared with 161 study participants (76.3%) who did not report 
new seizures. 
A total of 5 study participants (2.4%) reported new myoclonic seizures during the Treatment Period 
(compared with seizure history and/or Combined Baseline), compared with 128 study participants 
(60.7%) who did not report new myoclonic seizures. 
TEAEs related to epilepsy 
As of the clinical cut-off date for the interim CSR, overall, the most frequently reported TEAE of relevance 
to the PGTCS population was grand mal convulsion (11 study participants [5.2%]); followed by myoclonic 
epilepsy, petit mal epilepsy and convulsions (5 study participants [2.4%] each); depression (4 study 
participants [1.9%]); and status epilepticus (3 study participants [1.4%]).

Other significant TEAEs 
Ataxia 
In SP0982, 4 (3.3%) study participants on LCM and 0 on Placebo reported TEAEs of ataxia. All were 
considered related to IMP per the Investigator. The events were mild to moderate in intensity, were not 
considered serious, and did not lead to withdrawal of LCM. 
Based on these findings, the PT of Ataxia is proposed as a new ADR for LCM in patients with PGTCS. Of 
note, ADRs of Balance disorder, Coordination abnormal, Gait disturbance, Dizziness, Vertigo, and 
Nystagmus are already listed for LCM in the EU-SmPC. 
It is agreed that this PT should be included as ADR in the product information. The events were mild or 
moderate and considered related to study drug by the investigator. Three of the cases were reported in 
adults and one in a 13-year-old paediatric patient. All events were reported during the titration phase.  
Overall in study SP0982, differences in the incidence of TEAEs between the LCM and Placebo groups were 
observed for PTs of dizziness (23.1% vs 5.8%, respectively), somnolence (16.5% vs 14.0%, 
respectively), headache (14.0% vs 9.9%, respectively), nausea (9.9% vs 5.8%, respectively), vomiting 
(5.8% vs 0.8%, respectively), ataxia (3.3% vs 0%, respectively), disturbance in attention (3.3% vs 0%, 
respectively), myoclonic epilepsy (2.5% vs 0%, respectively), vertigo (6.6% vs 1.7%, respectively), and 
vision blurred (3.3% vs 0.8%, respectively). These ADR terms (except ataxia) are already included in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.

There were no reports of ataxia in the interim EP0012 study.  
Hepatic 
In the controlled study SP0982, the incidence of study participants meeting criteria for potential drug-
induced liver injury (PDILI) at any visit on treatment was similar between the LCM (1.7%; 2 of 119 study 
participants) and Placebo (2.5%; 3 of 121 study participants) groups. Two study participants (1.7%) in 
the Placebo group reported 2 TEAEs of blood bilirubin increased. Overall, 8 study participants (3.3%) 
reported 8 TEAEs of ALT increased during the Treatment Period, including 4 study participants (3.3%) 
each in the LCM and Placebo groups. Seven study participants (2.9%) reported 7 TEAEs of AST increased, 
including 2 study participants (1.7%) in the LCM group and 5 study participants (4.1%) in the Placebo 
group. All of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity.  
A total of 4 study participants in study EP0012 reported AEs related to PDILI, 3 of which were TEAEs. 
None of these were considered related to LCM by the investigator. No study participants reported TEAEs 
meeting the criteria for Hy’s law. A brief description of these cases is provided below.  
•  A subject in the ≥46 Weeks completer cohort who reported an AE of liver disorder during the Pre-Treatment Period. 
The event began on Day -98, was nonserious, mild in intensity, and was considered not related to LCM by the 
Investigator. The event was continuous and was resolving at the time of clinical cut-off. No further details were 
available at the time of interim reporting. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant during the study 
included lamotrigine and levetiracetam. 
•  A subject in the ≥94 Weeks completer cohort who reported a TEAE of alanine aminotransferase increased during 
the Treatment Period. The event began on Day 17; the LCM dose at onset was 400mg and the study participant 
received this dose for 16 days prior to the event onset. At Visit 2 (Week 2, Day 17), the study participant had a 
markedly abnormal high ALT value of 319U/L (normal range: 0 to 33U/L), which was classified as NCI CTC Grade 3. 
This value was a change from Baseline of 285U/L, with minimum and maximum post-Baseline values of 14U/L and 
319U/L, respectively. The event resulted in an interruption of LCM. A PDILI test panel was performed using the 
local laboratory and a hepatologist was consulted. The study participant’s ALT value had returned to within normal 
limits by Visit 5 (Week 22); no sign of drug-induced liver injury was present, and the study participant’s LCM dose 
was continued. The study participant’s ALT value remained normal for the remainder of the reporting period. The 
TEAE was nonserious, moderate in intensity, and was considered not related to LCM by the Investigator. The event 
was continuous and resolved 15 days after onset. Concomitant AEDs and benzodiazepines used by the study 
participant during the study included levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and clobazam. 
•  A subject in the ≥94 Weeks completer cohort who reported a TEAE of hepatic steatosis during the Treatment 
Period. The event began on Day 287; the LCM dose at onset was 400mg and the study participant received this 
dose for 286 days prior to the event onset. The TEAE was nonserious, mild in intensity, and was considered not 
related to LCM by the Investigator. No action was taken with LCM. The event was continuous and was resolving at 
the time of clinical cut-off. Concomitant AEDs used by the study participant during the study included lamotrigine, 
phenytoin, and brivaracetam. 
•  A subject in the ≥46 Weeks completer cohort who reported a TEAE of hepatic steatosis during the Treatment 
Period. The event began on Day 1; the LCM dose at onset was 400mg and the study participant received this dose 
for 1 day prior to the event onset. The TEAE was nonserious, mild in intensity, and was considered not related to 
LCM by the Investigator. No action was taken with LCM. The event was continuous and was resolving at the time of 
clinical cut-off. Concomitant AEDs and benzodiazepines used by the study participant during the study included 
clonazepam and carbamazepine. 
Overall, the data do not evoke new safety concerns about hepatic toxicity.

Suicidality 
In study SP0982, no study participants in the LCM group reported positive responses Columbia-Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Question 4 or 5 during the Treatment Period. Two study participants in 
the LCM group reported TEAEs of suicidal ideation during the Treatment Period. As of the clinical cut-off 
date for the interim CSR, 3 study participants had positive suicide ideation responses to C-SSRS 
Questions 4 and 5 at Baseline, and 1 study participant each had a positive response at the ET Visit and at 
the Week 118 Visit. In addition, 1 study participant reported a TEAE of suicide ideation. No actual suicide 
attempts were reported in the C-SSRS assessment. 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour are sufficiently covered by section 4.4 of the current product information. 
Cardiac events and ECG-related observations 
In study SP0982, overall and by development subgroups, mean and median changes from Baseline to 
Last Visit for all 12-lead ECG parameters were small, with the exception of mean change in PR interval, 
which was 9.96ms in the LCM group compared with -0.79ms in the Placebo group. This effect is 
consistent with the known safety profile of LCM. 
A summary of TEAEs related to abnormal ECG findings is presented in the table below. Overall, the most 
common TEAEs related to ECG findings values were sinus bradycardia and bundle branch block right (2 
study participants [0.8%] each). 
Table 24: Incidence of TEAEs related to abnormal ECG findings in study SP0982 (safety set) 
No trends related to age category were observed for these adverse events. The mean change in PR 
interval seems to be consistent with prior data in paediatric patients with POS (procedure II-65-G). 
In study SP0982, one patient in the placebo group reported a TEAEs of sinus bradycardia. In study 
EP0012, one patient reported sinus bradycardia and one 2 events of bradycardia, respectively. In both 
patients, the events were of mild severity and not related to study drug according to the investigator.  
Cardiac rhythm and conduction AEs including sinus bradycardia are known ADRs for LCM and covered in 
the product information.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths occurred in the completed clinical studies, or as of the cut-off date of study EP0012. 
Other SAEs 
Study SP0982 
A summary of serious TEAEs is provided in the table below.  
Table 25: Serious TEAEs in study SP0982 (safety set) 
Serious TEAEs were reported for 8 study participants (6.6%) in the LCM group compared with 4 study 
participants (3.3%) in the Placebo group.  
Serious TEAEs considered related to study medication by the investigator included nausea, vomiting, 
transaminases increased, status epilepticus, and dizziness, reported by 1 study participant (0.8%) each; 
one study participant (0.8%) in the placebo group reported a related serious TEAE of femur fracture. 
The reported PT terms appear to be mostly consistent with the previously reported safety profile of LCM. 
There were 3 LCM patients with reported SAEs of dizziness according to the narrative list, as opposed to 2 
in the summary table above. However, the event for one patient started during the transition phase to 
study EP0012. The patient was also listed with an SAE of nausea.  
Of note, one patient in the LCM group experienced an SAE of status epilepticus and one experienced 
grand mal convulsion. A brief description of these cases (condensed from the narratives) follows below.  
- A subject, assigned to LCM, was first diagnosed with epilepsy in 1990. He developed serious and severe status 
epilepticus during the Titration Period, 10 days after study drug initiation. Prior to the event, the patient had received 
LCM 100 mg/day. Concomitant antiepileptic medication(s) and benzodiazepines included lamotrigine and 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 67/88 
 
  
  
 
levetiracetam. After several seizures, the patient was admitted to the ER. The participant’s condition was diagnosed as 
status epilepticus, acidosis, aspiration pneumonitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, acute urinary tract infection (UTI), renal 
insufficiency, and vomiting. Following hospitalization and treatment, the event resolved after 3 days. The SAE was 
considered related to study drug and the patient was discontinued from the study.   
- A subject, assigned to LCM, was first diagnosed with epilepsy in 2016. He developed a mild grand mal convulsion 
during the Titration Period and was presented to the ER. The event occurred 30 days after study drug initiation. At the 
time of the tonic-clonic seizure aggravation, the study participant was taking LCM 250 mg/day and had been at this 
dose for 1 day in this study. During the 7 days prior to the event, he had received LCM 200 mg/day. Concomitant 
antiepileptic medication(s) and benzodiazepines at the time of the event included lamotrigine and levetiracetam. There 
were no other concomitant medications at the time of the event. The relationship of study drug to the event was 
reported as not related. The event resolved 2 days after onset. As stated in the narrative, approximately one month 
later, the patient again experienced episodes of tonic-clonic seizures and was re-hospitalized due to suspected head 
trauma (mild). The patient completed the study.  
Of note, an additional patient in the LCM group developed severe grand mal convulsion during post-
treatment (transition to study EP0012). The patient was not taking LCM at the time of the event.  
In general, from the table of narratives provided by the MAH to list each study participant with a serious 
TEAE, it is noted that the number of subjects for whom at least one event of relevant TEAE was reported 
as SAE is 16 and not 12 as displayed above in the table. However, for two subjects the events occurred in 
the post-treatment period: a subject randomized to PBO experienced an SAE of clonic convulsion after 17 
days off-study medication, and a subject randomized to LCM who experienced induced abortion during 
211 days after study drug initiation and when off study drug for 15 days. The missing data are expected 
to pertain to these subjects and the MAH was requested to further discuss any possible discrepancies, 
check the incidence and numbers of all SAEs and provide updated summary tables and lists of SAE 
narrative cases as appropriate.  
The only SAE of nausea listed is assumed to refer to a subject with BMI 34.7kg/m2, with a 1-year known 
history of epilepsy and on concomitant levetiracetam and brivaracetam who experienced moderate SAEs 
of dizziness, nausea, somnolence, and vomiting 16 days after study drug initiation, during the Titration 
Period, while on LCM 250mg/day for 1 day. A first episode of PGTCS, on the same day as the events, was 
also reported. The event was reported as related to LCM. The subject was hospitalized for one day. Per 
definition, hospitalization configures a TEAE to be of severe intensity, not moderate, as depicted.  
In addition, a subject with BMI 18.6kg/m2, with approximately 8-months history of epilepsy and on 
concomitant lamotrigine, experienced SAEs of dizziness and nausea, 194 days after study drug initiation 
and while on LCM 400mg/day for 4 days. Both events were considered mild in intensity, were reported as 
related to study drug and started during the transition/taper period before entering EP0012. 
One SAE of head injury was reported (and is missing from the table) for a subject with BMI 24.1kg/m2, 
with approximately 2-year history of epilepsy as of the time of enrolment, on concomitant lamotrigine 
and levetiracetam, who experienced SAEs of contusion, headache, grand mal convulsion and head injury 
across a two-month period. The event of Head injury was reported as mild in intensity, occurred during 
the Transition Period, 69 days after study drug initiation and while on LCM 400mg/day for 33 days in this 
study.  The event was reported as not related to study drug.  
One more SAE of grand mal convulsion was reported for a subject randomized to LCM, who experienced 
an episode of Epilepsy aggravated (IIE) while on concomitant valproic acid, only two days after taking 
LCM 400 mg, and during the Transition/Taper Period. 
One patient developed an SAE of increased transaminases which also resulted in discontinuation from the 
study treatment (and study): 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 68/88 
 
  
  
A subject, assigned to LCM) was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2010. The patient developed an SAE of moderate increased 
transaminases during the Maintenance Period of the study, 90 days after drug initiation. At the time of the SAE, the 
patient was treated with 400 mg LCM. The patient had been at this dose for 69 days. Concomitant antiepileptic 
medication(s) and benzodiazepines at the time of the event included valproic acid and levetiracetam. There were no 
other concomitant medications. According to the narrative, her ALT and AST levels had also been slightly increased 
(~2 X ULN) prior to LCM initiation. The patient developed a 3-fold increase in the level of ALT and AST. Additional 
diagnostic tests for e.g. viral hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus and infectious mononucleosis were negative. The event was 
considered related to study medication and resolved 265 days after onset and following discontinuation of LCM and 
dose reduction in valproate. 
Liver function test abnormalities is covered by section 4.8 of the SmPC. Overall, no new safety concerns 
were identified.  
Study EP0012 
The most frequently reported SAEs (≥1%) were in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders (19 study 
participants [9.0%]), followed by Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (6 [2.8%]); 
Gastrointestinal disorders (4 [1.9%]); and Infections and infestations (3 [1.4%]). 
In the SOC of Nervous system disorders, the only SAE reported by ≥5 study participants was grand mal 
convulsion (8 study participants [3.8%] reported 9 SAEs). Of these 9 SAEs, 4 were mild, 3 were 
moderate, and 2 were severe; none of the events were considered related to LCM by the Investigator. 
Table 3:  Serious TEAEs in study EP0012 (safety set) 
As explained in the footnote of the table, for the ≥4 to <12 years category, all serious TEAEs were 
included; for all other age categories, serious TEAEs by PT that occurred in ≥2 study participants were 
included. One patient had an SAE of myoclonic epilepsy that also resulted in discontinuation from the 
study: 
A subject entered the open-label study and received the first dose of LCM 400 mg/day in Apr 2017. The patient was 
assigned to the LCM group in the feeder study. She had been diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 15 but her medical 
history was otherwise unremarkable. Concomitant antiepileptic medication(s) and benzodiazepines at the time of the 
myoclonic epilepsy included the following: zonisamide and ethosuximide. Other concomitant medication(s) at the time 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021

of the event included: ibuprofen, hydroxyzine, ergocalciferol, folic acid and multivitamins. The study participant 
experienced a nonserious adverse event (AE) of petit mal epilepsy (worsening absence seizures) on 07 Nov 2017. The 
event resolved on 14 Jan 2019. The relationship of the study drug to the event was reported as related.  
The study participant experienced a SAE of myoclonic epilepsy on 01 Mar 2018, during the Treatment Period. The 
event occurred 325 days after study drug initiation. The event was considered moderate in intensity. The relationship 
of the study drug to the event was reported as not related. At the time of the myoclonic epilepsy, the study participant 
was taking LCM 500 mg/day tablets and had been at this dose for 52 days in this study. The event resolved on 29 
November 2018, 274 days after onset. The patient discontinued from the study due to the myoclonic seizures. The 
final dose of study drug was taken on 13 January 2019. The final visit was not reported.  
A causal relationship to LCM cannot be excluded.  
Also, the incidence of SAEs was significantly higher in the paediatric PGTCS-population compared to 
adults with PGTCSs. 
In pool SGTC-2 (Studies SP0961 and SP0962), overall, a total of 4 study participants (8.2%) experienced 
serious TEAEs (pneumonia, convulsion, migraine, petit mal epilepsy, and abnormal behaviour), all of 
whom were adults. No serious TEAEs were reported in >1 study participant. 
Laboratory findings 
Study SP0982 
Overall, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment-related changes in mean or median haematology 
values were observed. The incidence of TEAEs related to abnormal haematology values was generally low 
and similar between the LCM and the Placebo groups. The incidences of TEAEs related to haematology 
abnormalities were low across age categories. No haematology-related TEAEs were reported in pediatric 
study participants.  
Similarly, no consistent or clinically relevant treatment-related changes in mean or median clinical 
chemistry and endocrinology values were observed. The incidence of TEAEs related to abnormal clinical 
chemistry values was generally low and similar between the LCM and Placebo groups. Overall, the most 
common TEAEs related to abnormal clinical chemistry values were ALT increased (8 study participants 
[3.3%]), AST increased (7 study participants [2.9%]), and gamma glutamyl transferase increased (4 
study participants [1.7%]). All other TEAEs were reported by ≤2 study participants.  
Overall, 4 patients (3.3%) each in the placebo and LCM groups reported ALT increased.  
Study EP0012 
In EP0012, as of the clinical cut-off date for the interim CSR, mean values for the majority of 
haematology and clinical chemistry parameters remained within normal ranges. Overall, the incidences of 
TEAEs related to haematology abnormalities were low across age categories. No haematology-related 
TEAEs were reported in pediatric study participants. the incidence of TEAEs related to clinical chemistry 
abnormalities was low across age categories.  
Studies SP0961 and SP0962 
In these studies, in general, median values for haematology and clinical chemistry parameters remained 
within the normal range and the changes from Baseline were not of clinical relevance. In study SP0961 
the clinical chemistry abnormalities reported as a TEAE were ALT increased (1 [2.0%]) and hypokalaemia 
(1 [2.0%]). In study SP0962, clinical chemistry abnormalities reported as TEAEs were ALT, AST, and GGT 
increased (2 study participants each [5.1%]) and blood alkaline phosphatase increased and blood calcium 
decreased (1 study participant each [2.6%]).

Safety in special populations 
The MAH was requested to conduct an analysis of safety with respect to Race, Gender, Renal and hepatic 
impairment or Geographical region. 
As regards gender, dizziness an somnolence were more frequently reported in female than male subjects 
in the LCM group (30.3% vs. 14.5% and 22.7% vs. 9.1%, respectively), whereas the mismatch for 
headache was lower and slightly prevailing in male compared with female subjects in the LCM group 
(16.4% vs 12.1, respectively).  
In Pool SGTC-1 the overall incidence of most commonly reported TEAEs (in ≥2% of all subjects) by gender 
were similar in pediatric vs adult study participants (82.0% vs 86.8%, respectively), with somnolence 
more prevalent in pediatric than adult subjects (26.0 vs 15.6%), and dizziness almost equally reported 
(25.9 and 22.0% for adults and pediatrics, respectively). However, female subjects reported higher 
incidences of TEAEs as compared to males, either in adult or pediatric subjects regarding the following 
relevant TEAEs:  
- dizziness was more frequently reported in either female pediatric compared with male pediatric subjects 
(31.3% and 5.6%, respectively), or female adult compared with male adult subjects (33.6% and 15.7%, 
respectively); 
- headache was more frequently reported in either female pediatric compared with male pediatric 
subjects (21.9 and 11.1%, respectively), or in female adult compared with male adult subjects (24.1 vs 
16.9%). 
- somnolence was more frequently reported in female pediatric compared with male pediatric subjects 
(31.3 and 16.7%, respectively), whereas the incidence in female adult compared with male adult subjects 
was comparable (15.5 and 15.7%, respectively). 
- nausea was reported only in female pediatric subjects (18.8%) and was slightly more reported in female 
adult compared with male adult subjects (9.5 vs. 7.9%, respectively). 
No clinically relevant differences were observed in SP0982 and Pool SGTC-1 with respect to Region. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The LCM drug interactions are presented in the current SmPC. No new safety concerns were identified.  
No pregnancies were reported in EP0012 or SP0961. In study SP0982, one study participant had a 
positive urine pregnancy test on the Transition Period Final Clinic Visit. The study participant reported an 
SAE of abortion induced, and the subsequent urine pregnancy test at the Safety Follow-up Visit was 
negative. In SP0962, pregnancies were reported for 2 study participants, in both cases resulting in the 
delivery of a baby. In one case, nonserious AEs of pre-eclampsia and premature labour were reported, 
however, there were no AEs during the postpartum period.  
No new safety concerns were identified. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study SP0982 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation was low overall (16 study participants [6.6%]), 
including 11 (9.1%) in the LCM group and 5 study participants (4.1%) in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 71/88 
 
  
  
The most common TEAEs leading to discontinuation overall (by PT) were rash (3 study participants 
[1.2%]) and ALT increased, AST increased, and dizziness (2 [0.8%] each). Dizziness and suicidal ideation 
were more commonly reported in the LCM group (1.7% each) compared with the placebo group (0% 
each). 
The listing of narratives of Study SP0982 as well as listing 7.4 of the CSR list a total of 17 patients with 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation, 17 in the LCM group and 5 in the placebo group. The additional LCM 
patient was reported with suicidal thoughts (non-serious, moderate) during the post-treatment phase of 
the study.  
Overall, there were 3 patients with TEAEs leading to discontinuation that were also serious; two of these 
were in the LCM group: 
- A subject, first diagnosed with epilepsy in 1990. He developed serious and severe status epilepticus 
during the Titration Period, 10 days after study drug initiation. At the time of the event, the patient was 
taking LCM 50 mg/day. Concomitant antiepileptic medication(s) and benzodiazepines included lamotrigine 
and levetiracetam. Following hospitalization and treatment, the event was considered resolved after 3 
days.  
- A subject, was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2010. The patient developed an SAE of moderate increased 
transaminases during the Maintenance Period of the study, 90 after drug initiation. At the time of the 
SAE, the patient was treated with 400 mg LCM. Concomitant antiepileptic medication(s) and 
benzodiazepines at the time of the event included the following: valproic acid and levetiracetam. 
According to the narrative, her ALT and AST levels had been slightly increased also prior to LCM initiation. 
There were no other concomitant medications. The patient developed a 3-fold increase in the level of ALT 
and AST. The event resolved 265 days after onset and following discontinuation of LCM and dose 
reduction in valproate.  
Study EP0012 
As of the clinical cut-off date for the interim CSR, overall, a total of 5 study participants (2.4%) reported 
12 TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. These were most frequently reported in the Nervous 
system disorders SOC: 5 study participants (2.4%) reported 9 TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug; 1 event of myoclonic epilepsy was severe, not serious, and considered related to LCM by the 
Investigator, 1 event of myoclonic epilepsy was moderate, serious, and considered not related to LCM by 
the Investigator, and 1 event of convulsion was mild, serious, and considered not related to LCM by the 
Investigator. All other TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were mild or moderate in intensity 
and were nonserious.  
In Pool SGTC-2, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported by 7 (14.3%) study participants. With 
the exception of petit mal epilepsy (2 study participants [4.1%]), none of the TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation (vertigo, diplopia, vision blurred, nausea, gait disturbance, dizziness, grand mal 
convulsion, sedation, abnormal behaviour, confusional state, and hallucination) occurred in >1 study 
participant.  
Post marketing experience 
Since 2008, LCM has been approved worldwide in over 70 countries. Patient exposure (all known LCM 
exposures) was estimated using the available UCB sales data from 01 Sep 2008 to 28 Feb 2019 for the 
cumulative time interval. The total amount of product sold during the cumulative reporting interval is 
194,732,060,200 mg, as derived from the UCB sales data reported. The defined daily dose was assumed 
to be 300 mg. Accordingly, the patient exposure to LCM during the cumulative reporting interval from 01 
Sep 2008 to 28 Feb 2019 is estimated to be approximately 1,777,158 patient-years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 72/88 
 
  
  
Cumulatively, 578 safety case reports associated with the post-marketing use of LCM in patients with 
potential PGTCS were identified worldwide in the UCB Global Safety database. Among these 578 case 
reports, 281 case reports were considered relevant to PGTCS and 297 were considered non-PGTCS cases. 
The majority were received from US (45.8%) and Germany (18.86%). From the 216 cases for which 
gender was reported, 135 cases (48.04%) involved female and 81 cases (28.82%) involved male 
patients. From the 154 cases that reported age, 14 cases involved paediatric patients (4.98%), 128 
involved adults (45.55%), and 12 involved elderly patients (4.27%). 
In the 281 cases, 826 PTs were reported. The most frequently reported SOC as classified under the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 21.1 in patients who received LCM were 
Nervous system disorders (237 AEs; 28.69%) and General disorders and administration site conditions 
(195 AEs; 23.6%).  
A comprehensive review of the fatal cases (including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy [SUDEP]) and 
cases reported with significant AEs related to cardiac, syncope/loss of consciousness, suicidality, 
hepatotoxicity, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions/serious cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), 
dizziness/ataxia, other significant AEs including blood and lymphatic disorders, anaphylaxis, 
rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and impairment, pancreatitis, and AEs reported under the SOC Injury, 
poisoning, and procedural complication did not display concerns specific to the use of LCM in patients with 
PGTCS. 
A review of LCM use in PGTCS patients from the special populations of pregnancy and lactation, elderly, 
and paediatric did not exhibit concerns as compared to the known safety profile of LCM reported in 
VIMPAT SmPC. 
Based on review of cases related to drug abuse, lack of efficacy, intravenous (IV) and oral use of LCM, 
and worsening of seizure or new onset of seizures, no specific safety concerns were identified for use of 
LCM in PGTCS patients. 
A review of relevant publications describing the use of LCM in PGTCS patients did not identify specific 
safety concerns and were confounded by presence of other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
In conclusion, the cumulative post-marketing LCM analysis in PGTCS patients did not identify new safety 
concerns and supports the use of LCM as adjunctive therapy (or monotherapy) in PGTCS patients. The 
safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of LCM. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety analysis results from the EP0012 interim CSR and SP0982 final CSR, and SP0961 and SP0962 
final CSRs were submitted, as well as pooled safety summaries, were submitted from this extension of 
indication.  
The clinical safety data from adjunctive LCM use for the treatment of PGTCS in adults and paediatric 
study participants with IGE down to 4 years of age in study SP0982 included a total of 242 study 
participants. Of these, 49 study participants were <18 years of age (17 were 4 to <12 years of age and 
32 were ≥12 to <18 years of age) at the time of enrolment in SP0982. In total, 147 study participants in 
Pool SGTC-1 (the combined SP092 and interim EP0012 studies) have been exposed to adjunctive LCM 
treatment for PGTCS for at least 1 year. In all study participants, the median modal dose (mg/day) was 
400 mg (range: 100 mg to 800 mg), and the median maximum dose (mg/day) was 400 mg/day (range: 
100 mg to 800 mg). 
In the LCM group, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders 
(58 study participants [47.9%]), and Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders (25 study 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 73/88 
 
  
  
participants [20.7%] each). By PT, the most common TEAEs were dizziness (28 study participants 
[23.1%]), somnolence (20 [16.5%]), and headache (17 [14.0%]).  
In the Placebo group, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders (36 
study participants [29.8%]), Infections and infestations (23 study participants [19.0%]), and 
Gastrointestinal disorders (19 study participants [15.7%]). By PT, the most common TEAEs in the Placebo 
group were somnolence (17study participants [14.0%]), headache (12 study participants [9.9%]), and 
nausea and dizziness (7 study participants [5.8%] each. 
The most common related TEAEs for the LCM group were dizziness (21 study participants [17.4%]), 
somnolence (16 [13.2%]), and nausea (9 [7.4%]). The incidence of study participants reporting serious 
TEAEs was low overall (5.0%) and was 6.6% and 3.3% in the LCM and Placebo groups, respectively. The 
most commonly reported SAEs in the LCM were dizziness (1.7%) and somnolence (1.7%). No deaths 
were reported in the study.  
Paediatric patients in the LCM group showed higher exposure-duration adjusted rates of somnolence over 
placebo (5.94 vs. 1.70 per 100 pt-months) as compared to adult patients (2.84 vs. 5.46, respectively). 
This is reflected in the current product information (section 4.8 of the SmPC).   
As of the clinical cut-off date for the interim EP0012 study, the most frequently reported TEAEs (PT) per 
100 person-months were: nasopharyngitis (35 study participants [16.6%]), with a rate of 0.97 person-
months; headache (34 study participants [16.1%]), 0.94 person-months; dizziness (32 [15.2%]), 0.88 
person-months; somnolence (22 [10.4%]), 0.61 person-months; upper respiratory tract infection (14 
[6.6%]), 0.39 person-months; and contusion and nausea (13 [6.2%] each), 0.36 person-months each. 
The applicant provided a side-by-side presentation of common TEAEs between Pool SGTC-1 (studies 
SP0982 and the interim study EP0012 combined) as compared to two previously submitted data pools for 
the adult and paediatric POS populations (Pool S2 and Pool SPX-1), respectively. Overall, and considering 
differences in dataset sizes that may explain some of the fluctuations, the common TEAE pattern was 
broadly similar between the indications and for both populations.  
However, for further analyses, the MAH provided additional summary tables of exposure to LCM by age 
group and by weight band and also a side-by-side comparison of doses/exposure data between Pool 
SGTC-1 vs. Pool SPX-1 and Pool S2 from the POS populations. Overall, the median duration of exposure 
for pediatric study participants with PGTCS (≥4 to <18 years of age) and pediatric study participants with 
POS (≥4 to <16 years of age) were 369.5 days (range: 61 to 1035 days) and 300.0 days (range: 1 to 
860 days), respectively. Median duration of exposure for adult study participants with PGTCS (≥18 years 
of age) and adult study participants with POS (≥16 years of age) were 430.0 days (range: 1 to 1143 
days) and 726.0 days (range: 1.0 to 2913.0 days), respectively. Also, for this side-by-side comparison, 
the MAH provided tabulated TEAE data by age and weight band, for both PGTCS and POS using 
appropriate age cut-offs. The incidence of somnolence was higher for all age groups in PGTCS compared 
with POS. In study SP0982, paediatric patients in the LCM group showed higher rates of somnolence over 
placebo (5.94 vs. 1.70 per 100 pt-months), which was not observed in adult patient. Thus, this may 
indicate that paediatric patients with PGTCS are more at risk for this ADR. The relevant information is 
reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The applicant investigated the aggravation of absence seizures and myoclonic seizures by LCM. There was 
no clear evidence of worsening for days with absence seizures in the LCM group compared with Placebo. 
However, regarding myoclonic seizures, in SP0982, 3 study participants (2.5%) in the LCM group 
reported 3 TEAEs of myoclonic epilepsy during the Treatment Period compared with 0 in the placebo 
group. Two TEAEs of myoclonic epilepsy were considered as related, all 3 were mild to moderate in 
intensity, and none were considered as serious. In addition, 1 study participant in the LCM group reported 
a mild TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy during the Post-Treatment (Transition) Period. Myoclonus was reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 74/88 
 
  
  
by 1 study participant (0.8%) in the placebo group. Although these are few events, there could be an 
underreporting of myoclonic seizures as TEAEs in this study. 
A total of 96 study participants (LCM, n=47; placebo, n=49) in study SP0982 experienced myoclonic 
seizures during the Prospective Baseline. The percent changes from Prospective Baseline in median 
number of days with myoclonic seizures for the LCM and placebo groups were -32.5% and -51.8%, 
respectively, during the Titration period; -43.8% and -65.7%, respectively, during the first 12 weeks of 
the Treatment Period; and -54.6% and -65.7%, respectively, during the 24-week Treatment Period. 
Also, a total of 21 study participants experienced onset of myoclonic seizure or ≥50% worsening in days 
of myoclonic seizures, of which 14 study participants were in the LCM group and 7 were in the Placebo 
group. Of the 13 LCM study participants in this study with a medical history of myoclonic seizure at 
baseline, 8 reported ≥50% worsening in days of myoclonic seizures compared to the Baseline Period in at 
least one Treatment Period. However, only 2 cases of worsening of myoclonic seizures (during titration) 
were reported as TEAEs. The MAH was requested to discuss this issue of potential underreporting. 
According to the MAH, such reporting differences (using 28-day blocks) may not always qualify as an AE 
in the view of the investigator in light of the prior knowledge of the patient’s history. In this regard, a 
longer baseline period would have been a more objective way to assess whether significant fluctuations in 
seizure patterns were truly treatment emergent or not. 
There were 4 patients in the LCM group (8.5%) who experienced >75% increase in myoclonic seizures 
during the treatment period as compared to the prospective baseline (as compared to one patient in the 
placebo groups). Even if not all of these shifts were considered to constitute AEs by the investigator, 
there remains an imbalance between the groups.  
The risk of myoclonic seizures or worsening of myoclonic seizures also appeared to be increased during 
titration of LCM. There were 3 patients with TEAEs of myoclonic epilepsy during the 6-week titration 
period as compared with 1 (myoclonus) during the 18-week maintenance phase and 1 (myoclonic 
epilepsy) post-treatment. Also, for the 4 patients who reported 50% seizure worsening for days with 
myoclonic seizures in the study as compared to prospective baseline, this occurred during the titration 
period (4/47 patients for LCM as compared with 2/49 for placebo).  
Myoclonic epilepsy is therefore added as a new ADR for LCM in patients with PGTCS (section 4.8 of 
SmPC). In addition, a warning stating that new onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been 
reported in patients with PGTCS is added in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
In SP0982, 4 (3.3%) study participants on LCM and 0 on Placebo reported TEAEs of ataxia. All were 
considered related to study drug per the Investigator. The events were mild to moderate in intensity and 
did not lead to withdrawal of LCM. Three of the cases were reported in adults and one in a 13-year-old 
paediatric patient. All events were reported during the titration phase. The PT of ataxia is therefore added 
as ADR in section 4.8. in the SmPC. 
Two study participants (1.7%) in the Placebo group reported 2 TEAEs of blood bilirubin increased. Overall, 
8 study participants (3.3%) reported 8 TEAEs of ALT increased during the Treatment Period, including 4 
study participants (3.3%) each in the LCM and Placebo groups. Seven study participants (2.9%) reported 
7 TEAEs of AST increased, including 2 study participants (1.7%) in the LCM group and 5 study 
participants (4.1%) in the Placebo group. All of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Overall, 
TEAEs related to hepatic toxicity are consistent with the existing product information and known safety 
profile of LCM in the POS population.  
Two study participants in the LCM group in study SP0982 reported TEAEs of suicidal ideation during the 
Treatment Period. In addition, 1 study participant reported a TEAE of suicide ideation. Two study 
participants in the LCM group in study SP0982 reported TEAEs of suicidal ideation during the Treatment 
Assessment report

Period. Information on Suicidal ideation and behaviour is already included in section 4.4 of the current PI 
as class effect.  
Present data are too scarce to allow to assess the potential impact of LCM on behaviour and executive 
functioning in children with primary generalized epilepsy.  
Overall, in study SP0982, the most common abnormalities related to ECG findings values were sinus 
bradycardia and bundle branch block right (2 study participants [0.8%] each) but there were no AEs of 
cardiac disorders in the LCM group. ECG-related observations included a mean change in PR interval, 
which was 9.96 ms in the LCM group compared with -0.79ms in the Placebo group. This effect is 
consistent with the known safety profile of LCM. 
A total of 2 study participants in EP0012 reported AEs with cardiac and electrocardiogram (ECG) related 
PTs, 1 of which was a TEAE (sinus bradycardia and 2 events of bradycardia, respectively). These events 
were not considered related to LCM by the investigator although this cannot be excluded given the known 
safety profile of LCM.  
No new safety concerns were identified in the interim data from study EP0012. The safety profile from the 
open-label studies SP0961 and SP0962 (Pool SGTC-2) was also consistent with the above safety findings. 
However, further data from this study are pending; this study is included in the pharmacovigilance plan 
as a Category 3 study with a due date of August 2024. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Of the 49 paediatric study participants (<18 years of age) in study SP0982, a total of 8 (6.6%) in the 
LCM group and 9 (7.4%) in the placebo group were ≥4 to <12 years of age, and 16 study participants 
(13.2%) in each group were ≥12 to <18 years of age.  
Paediatric patients in the LCM group showed higher rates of somnolence vs. placebo as compared to adult 
patients. This is appropriately addressed in the product information. In general, the current safety data in 
the paediatric patients was consistent with the data seen in adults and prior safety data of LCM in 
paediatric patients with POS.  
However, myoclonic seizure worsening was more frequent in children compared to adults.  
For paediatric study participants, the percentage of study participants in the LCM group with 50% 
worsening of myoclonic seizures was 20% (1 of 5) each during the Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the 
Treatment Period, and during the 24-week Treatment Period. No paediatric study participants in the 
Placebo group had 50% worsening during the Titration Period, first 12 weeks of the Treatment Period, or 
24-week Treatment Period. As discussed above, section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC is updated to reflect the 
relevant data regarding myoclonic epilepsy. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP concluded that, based on the available safety data, the safety profile of LCM in the treatment 
of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy is acceptable. 
The Product Information have been updated to reflect the relevant safety information, including onset or 
worsening of myoclonic seizures.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to reflect the 
proposed extension of the Vimpat and Lacosamide UCB indication as adjunctive therapy in the treatment 
of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) 
aged 4 years and older. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
The applicant takes this opportunity to align the Product Information of Lacosamide UCB with the Product 
Information of Vimpat, by implementing the latest editorial changes that have been approved for Vimpat. 
In addition, the applicant takes this opportunity to align the Product Information of Vimpat and Lacosamide 
UCB with the QRD template version 10.1 
Please refer to Attachment 1 for full details of agreed Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA. This is acceptable for the following reasons: 
- The last user testing report was submitted in July 2016 for the Vimpat POS extension of indication in 
children down to 4 years of age (II/65). 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 80/88 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- The pre-authorisation guidance states that a user consultation is always required for the first 
authorisation of a medicinal product with a new active substance, medicinal products which have 
undergone a change in legal status, medicinal products with a new presentation and medicinal products 
with particular critical safety issues. As this application object does not fall in one of the above-mentioned 
situation, it was agreed pre submission that no user consultation will be provided. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The most common seizure type in patients with epilepsy is partial seizures (57%), followed by tonic-clonic 
seizures (23%), absence seizures (6%), and myoclonic seizures (3%); the latter 3 seizure types comprise 
the majority of generalized seizures (convulsive and nonconvulsive) (Hauser et al, 1993). 
Generalized seizures are those in which the first clinical changes indicate initial involvement of both brain 
hemispheres. Consciousness may be impaired, and this impairment may be the initial manifestation. 
Motor manifestations are bilateral. Generalized epilepsies can be further classified as primary/idiopathic 
and secondary/symptomatic epilepsies. In view of the purpose of this application, only idiopathic 
generalized epilepsy (IGE) is discussed. 
IGE is a category of disorders defined by strict clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) features proposed 
by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of epileptic syndromes (ILAE, 1989). 
Clinical experience has shown that IGEs represent a heterogeneous condition in which many factors 
interact (such as age at onset, external factors, role of medications, and sleep) (Jallon and Latour, 2005). 
IGE are assumed to have a genetic etiology and onset almost always occurs during childhood or 
adolescence, although there are exceptions; some patients develop these kinds of epilepsies after the 
second decade of life or, rarely, even later. 
Within the group of IGEs, there are a number of different epilepsy syndromes. Patients with the most 
common IGE syndromes (ie, childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy, and epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening) may experience generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures.  
Typically, the onset of childhood absence epilepsy is between 4 to 8 years of age, with peak onset at ages 
6 to 7 years. Approximately 40% develop generalized tonic-clonic seizures as they reach adolescence. 
The onset of juvenile absence epilepsy is between 10 to 17 years of age, with peak onset between 10 and 
12 years. These patients may have occasional tonic-clonic seizures. 
The onset of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy varies from 8 to 26 years and peaks at 12 to 14 years. Juvenile 
myoclonic epilepsy is characterized by myoclonic seizures that appear with tonic-clonic seizures in most 
patients, and absence seizures in about one-third of patients. 
The onset of epilepsy with grand mal seizures on awakening is usually in the second decade of life. This 
syndrome typically presents as a generalized tonic-clonic seizure within 2 hours after awakening but may 
include myoclonic and/or absence seizures. 
IGE with PGTCS only is considered a syndrome in the new ILAE diagnostic scheme (Engel, 2006) and 
incorporates ‘epilepsy with PGTCS on awakening’ (ILAE, 1989; Janz, 2000). The terminology ‘IGE with 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 81/88 
 
  
  
PGTCS only’ implies that it includes only those patients with PGTCS alone (i.e. without absences and/or 
jerks) and that these may occur at any time. Overall, PGTCS are reported to occur on awakening (17% to 
53% of patients), diffusely while awake (23% to 36%) or during sleep (27% to 44%), or randomly (13% 
to 26%) (Wolf, 2002). It is undetermined what proportion of these patients also has other generalized 
seizures (jerks or absences). 
Age at onset varies from 6 to 47 years with a peak at 16 to 17 years; 80% have their first PGTCS in the 
second decade of life. Men (55%) slightly predominate over women, probably because of differences in 
alcohol exposure and sleep habits. Exact prevalence of ‘IGE with PGTCS only’ is unknown. If strict criteria 
apply (PGTCS only), this may be very small (0.9% of IGE), but others give a prevalence of 13% to 15% 
among IGE (Roger et al, 1994; Oller-Daurella and Oller, 1994). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
As the patient population with PGTCS is heterogeneous and as PGTCS can occur as an isolated seizure 
type or in association with other generalized seizure types, treatment of PGTCS is complex. The MAH 
shortly presented the available treatment options.

In the past decade, several new options for the medical treatment of epilepsy have been introduced, 
including novel AEDs and vagus nerve stimulation. The newer AEDs differ from older agents in several 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 82/88 
 
  
  
 
important ways, including mechanism of action, spectrum of activity, and PK characteristics (Herman and 
Pedley, 1998). 
Between 15% and 40% of patients with generalized epilepsy remain refractory to therapy or do not 
tolerate the currently available AEDs (valproate, ethosuximide, phenytoin [PHT], lamotrigine [LTG], 
carbamazepine [CBZ], topiramate, and levetiracetam) (Bartolomei et al, 1997; Verrotti et al, 2007). 
Some of these AEDs can induce serious, life threatening AEs (e.g. aplastic anaemia, rash, hepatic failure). 
Generalized tonic-clonic seizures may respond to drugs that aggravate typical absences and/or myoclonic 
jerks (Genton, 2000; Verrotti et al, 2007). Two IGE seizure types, typical absences and myoclonic jerks, 
are particularly prone to aggravation by certain AEDs (CBZ, vigabatrin, tiagabine, PHT, phenobarbital 
[PB], and LTG). The pharmacodynamic aggravation is usually associated with a clear increase of interictal 
(and ictal) EEG changes. 
Of patients with IGE experiencing PGTCS, clinical experience has shown that up to 30% of patients who 
are treated with currently available AEDs have insufficient seizure control or unacceptable drug 
tolerability. Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need for new treatment options in this patient 
population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main studies supporting the indication of LCM in the treatment of PGTCS with IGE in adults and 
children 4 years of age and older are listed the table below.  
Study SP0982 provided data for efficacy assessment. The EP0012 study provided data for long-term LCM 
treatment assessment in the open-label setting. Studies SP0961 and SP0962 were used only for safety 
assessment.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The risk of developing a second PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period was statistically significantly 
lower in the LCM group compared with the placebo group; the survival estimates at the end of the 
Treatment Period were 55.27% in the LCM group and 33.37% in the placebo group (HR: 0.540 [95% CI: 
0.377, 0.774]; p<0.001).  
Results on the primary analysis were confirmed by all sensitivity analyses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 83/88 
 
  
  
 
 
The stratified KM estimate of the proportion of study participants who were seizure free at Day 166 was 
31.3% (95% CI: 22.8%, 39.9%) in the LCM group and 17.2% (95% CI: 10.4%, 24.0%) in the placebo 
group. The difference in seizure freedom rate at Day 166 between the LCM and placebo groups was 
14.1% (95% CI: 3.2%, 25.1%); this difference was statistically significant (p=0.011). 
The risk of developing a first PGTCS during the 24-week Treatment Period was lower in the LCM group 
compared with the placebo group; the survival estimates at the end of the Treatment Period were 
30.97% in the LCM group and 17.27% in the placebo group (HR: 0.683 [95% CI: 0.507, 0.921]; 
p=0.012). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Even though the primary endpoint as well secondary endpoints supported the favourable effects of LCM 
treatment compared to placebo in patients with PGTCS in IGE during 24-weeks treatment period, some 
uncertainties remain.  
Subgroup analysis (age, sex, region, baseline PGTCS frequency, number of AEDs) did not reveal any 
obvious differences in terms to response to LCM treatment of PGTCS seizures. However, for the subgroup 
Western/Central Europe comprising 77 subjects, the KM survival estimates were numerically somewhat 
lower in the LCM compared to the placebo group (46.22 % and 48.30 %, respectively). A very limited 
number of patients treated with LCM was aged <18 years: 8 patients in the ≥4 to <12 years age group 
and 16 patients in the >12 to <18 years range. However, from these very limited data, it appears that 
LCM treatment in paediatric patients is similar to the one observed in adults regarding the appearance of 
2nd PGTC seizure or PGTCS seizure frequency with the exception on PGTCS free status where adults 
seems to have better response compared to paediatric patients.  
The data regarding treatment beyond 24 weeks is difficult to interpret since the long-term open label 
study EP00012 is not finished and the interim results indicate that among patients who discontinued 
treatment substantial number of patients did so due to lack of effect. There was no clear pattern in timing 
of discontinuation from this study due to lack of efficacy.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The clinical safety data from LCM use for the treatment of PGTCS in adults and paediatric study 
participants with IGE down to 4 years of age in study SP0982 included a total of 242 study participants. 
Of these, 49 study participants were <18 years of age (17 were 4 to <12 years of age and 32 were ≥12 
to <18 years of age) at the time of enrolment in SP0982. 
In the LCM group, TEAEs were most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders 
(58 study participants [47.9%]), and Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders (25 study 
participants [20.7%] each). By PT, the most common TEAEs were dizziness (28 study participants 
[23.1%]), somnolence (20 [16.5%]), and headache (17 [14.0%]). In the Placebo group, TEAEs were also 
most commonly reported in the SOCs of Nervous system disorders (36 study participants [29.8%]), 
Infections and infestations (23 study participants [19.0%]), and Gastrointestinal disorders (19 [15.7%]). 
By PT, the most common TEAEs were somnolence (17 [14.0%]), headache (12 [9.9%]), and nausea and 
dizziness (7 [5.8%] each).  
Paediatric patients in the LCM group showed higher exposure duration-adjusted rates of somnolence over 
placebo (5.94 vs. 1.70 per 100 person-months) as compared to adult patients (2.84 vs. 5.46, 
respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/23665/2021 
Page 84/88 
 
  
  
The incidence of study participants reporting serious TEAEs was 6.6% and 3.3% in the LCM and Placebo 
groups, respectively. The most commonly reported SAEs in the LCM were dizziness (1.7%) and 
somnolence (1.7%). No deaths were reported in the study. 
Four (3.3%) study participants on LCM and 0 on Placebo reported unlisted TEAEs of ataxia. All were 
considered related to study drug per the Investigator. 
The applicant investigated the aggravation of absence seizures and myoclonic seizures by LCM. There was 
no clear evidence of worsening for days with absence seizures in the LCM group compared with Placebo. 
Three study participants (2.5%) in the LCM group reported 3 TEAEs of myoclonic epilepsy during the 
Treatment Period compared with 0 in the placebo group. In addition, 1 study participant in the LCM group 
reported a mild TEAE of myoclonic epilepsy during the Post-Treatment (Transition) Period. Myoclonus was 
reported by 1 study participant (0.8%) in the placebo group. Also, a total of 21 study participants 
experienced onset of myoclonic seizure or ≥50% worsening in days of myoclonic seizures, of which 14 
study participants were in the LCM group and 7 were in the Placebo group. 
As of the clinical cut-off date for the interim EP0012 study, the most frequently reported TEAEs (PT) per 
100 person-months were: nasopharyngitis (35 study participants [16.6%]), with a rate of 0.97 person-
months; headache (34 study participants [16.1%]), 0.94 person-months; dizziness (32 [15.2%]), 0.88 
person-months; somnolence (22 [10.4%]), 0.61 person-months; upper respiratory tract infection (14 
[6.6%]), 0.39 person-months; and contusion and nausea (13 [6.2%] each), 0.36 person-months each. 
The safety of LCM in the treatment of PGTCS in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with 
IGE was in general consistent with the known safety profile of LCM in the POS population except for 
worsening of myoclonic seizures.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The available data are too scarce to allow the assess the potential impact of LCM on behaviour and 
executive functioning in children with IGE. 
The CHMP noted that additional safety data are pending as the open-label extension study EP0012 is still 
ongoing.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) are considered to be the most debilitating seizure type 
within IGE, since repeated and uncontrolled seizures may result in irreversible damage to the brain. 
Treatment with LCM as demonstrated reduced risk of appearance of PGTCS during the treatment period 
(24 week) compared to placebo in the SP0982 study. Other generalized seizures, like absences and 
myoclonic seizures, apparently have not been improved by the LCM treatment.  
The improvement in the most debilitating type of generalized seizures (PGTCS) is considered to be of 
major importance for patients with IGE. It is expected that positive effects on PGTCS are not achieved at 
the expense of worsening of other generalized seizures. Other AEDs (e.g. carbamazepine or lamotrigine) 
have reported negative effects on other types of generalized seizures such as absences or myoclonic 
seizures. It is recognised that these effects can however be handled with the relevant warnings in the 
SmPC.  
A complete understanding of treatment benefit in paediatric patients is hampered by the small number of 
children recruited in the pivotal trial. The observed LCM-induced worsening of myoclonic seizures is a 
concern and could be more relevant for the paediatric population compared to adults. 
Long-term sustained treatment effect is of key importance for patients with the PGTCS for patients with 
IGE. However, the data regarding treatment beyond 24 weeks is difficult to interpret since the long-term 
open label study EP00012 is not finished and the interim results indicate that among patients who 
discontinued treatment substantial number of patients did so due to lack of effect. 
Safety data for LCM in the treatment of PGTCS in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age 
with IGE were in general consistent with the known safety profile of LCM in the POS population except for 
ADRs of myoclonic seizures and ataxia. These ADRs are correctly reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
completed by a warning for the risk of myoclonic seizures in section 4.4.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The potential benefit of LCM treatment of PGTCS in the IGE should be weighed taking into account the 
effects on other generalized seizures such as absences and myoclonic seizures, as well as observed 
effects in the patients with specific diagnosis studied (e.g. Juvenile absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic 
epilepsy).  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R ratio of Vimpat/Lacosamide UCB as adjunctive therapy of primary generalised tonic-clonic 
seizures in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy is 
positive.

Lacosamide UCB and Vimpat. Consequently sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 15.1 has also been submitted. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. The MAH also takes the 
opportunity to align the PI of Lacosamide UCB with the PI of Vimpat. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the worksharing procedure, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and 
to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric

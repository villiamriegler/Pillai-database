exclude that the use of loratadine during the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with 
increased risk of hypospadias. As desloratadine is the major metabolite of loratadine, any safety 
or efficacy issues emerging for loratadine might be relevant also for desloratadine and a referral 
was  therefore  also  triggered  for  desloratadine  containing  medicinal  products.  Following 
consultation  with  the  Commission,  it  was  decided  to  introduce  the  conclusion  of  CPMP’s 
scientific assessment via a Type II variation.

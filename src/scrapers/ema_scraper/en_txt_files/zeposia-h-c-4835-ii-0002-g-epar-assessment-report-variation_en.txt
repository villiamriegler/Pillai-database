2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder that involves the surface 
mucosa, the crypt epithelium, and the submucosa of the colon. Patients with UC suffer from diarrhea, 
rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer, which can 
have a profound impact on patients’ quality of life.  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication is: 
Ozanimod is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative 
colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
The recommended dose is 0.92 mg ozanimod once daily. 
The capsules can be taken with or without food. 
The initial dose escalation regimen of ozanimod from Day 1 to Day 7 is required and shown below. 
Following the 7-day dose escalation, the once daily dose is 0.92 mg, starting on Day 8.

UC prevalence is estimated to be 70-500 cases per 100.000 with peak age of onset between 15 and 25 
years. Within Europe there is an east-west and north-south gradient, but the incidence appears to have 
increased in southern and eastern countries during recent years (ECCO guideline, 2017). In 15% of 
cases, UC is diagnosed in childhood and may present before school age. In general, mortality is not 
increased in UC but the disease may present as life-threatening acute severe colitis. Patients may live 
with a considerable symptom burden and high risk of disability despite medical treatment. 
Biologic features 
UC is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory bowel disease affecting the rectum and, in many instances, also 
part of/the entire colon. The etiology of UC is multifactorial, but likely includes a dysregulated mucosal 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 9/209 
 
 
 
 
immune response against commensal non-pathogenic bacteria of the colon, resulting in bowel 
inflammation. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Onset of disease most commonly occurs between 15 and 40 years of age. The clinical course of UC is 
characterized by a lifelong course of remissions and exacerbations. Patients with UC suffer from recurrent 
episodes of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdominal pain, fever, and are at an increased risk of 
perforated bowel, and toxic megacolon, and colorectal cancer. The estimated risk of colorectal cancer is 
approximately 2% after 10 years, 5% to 10% after 20 years, and 12% to 30% after 30 to 35 years of 
UC. Patients have a 10% cumulative risk of colectomy 5 years after diagnosis, and 15% at 10 
years.However, with colectomy, there is a 50% risk of continued inflammation in the residual intestinal 
pouch (pouchitis); ); after 10 years, approximately 12% of patients experience pouch failure and require 
conversion to a permanent ileostomy. Surgical complications of proctocolectomy with ileostomy include 
stenosis, prolapse, and other abdominal/pelvic sequelae including small bowel obstruction, fistula, 
infection, persistent pain, unhealed perineal wound, sexual and bladder dysfunction, and infertility. 
Patients with UC may also experience extra-intestinal manifestations including primary sclerosing 
cholangitis or eye, joint, or skin manifestations. Improved intestinal disease activity in UC is associated 
with an improvement in some extra-intestinal manifestations. 
Management 
The pathology of UC is characterized by a life-long chronic course of remissions and exacerbations. Until a 
cure is found, the overall goal of treatment for patients with active UC is to induce and maintain remission 
and to induce and maintain mucosal healing. Despite the advancements in therapies available to patients 
with UC, there are still a significant number of patients with moderate to severe UC who do not respond, 
lose response or are intolerant to available therapies. There is a high unmet need for new efficacious 
treatments for patients with manageable safety and with the convenience of an oral administration. 
The mainstay of therapy for mild to moderate UC is 5-aminosalicylic (5-ASA) agents. These agents are 
effective at inducing and maintaining remission in UC. The majority of patients with moderate to severe 
active UC benefit from topical, oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroids. Remission, however, cannot be 
maintained with steroids. Azathioprine (AZA) or mercaptopurine (MP) has been employed as 
glucocorticoid-sparing agents in patients unable to be weaned from glucocorticoids. Anti-tumour necrosis 
factor α (TNF) agents, integrin inhibitors and novel immunomodulatory agents (such as tofacitinib) are 
indicated for the treatment of UC patients refractory to standard treatment (as previously described). The 
biologic anti-TNF agents were the first newer-generation drugs to be approved for the treatment of UC, 
offering a treatment option for patients who had failed conventional therapy. In a systematic review of 
clinical trials, a high proportion of patients treated with anti-TNF therapy fail to achieve an initial response 
or remission to therapy. Within reported clinical trials, approximately 19% to 58% of patients are primary 
non-responders (ie, fail to achieve clinical response) to anti-TNF therapy. Gordon et al, 2015 also 
reported that between 17% to 22% of patients with UC experienced a secondary nonresponse (ie, loss of 
response after initial response). 
Real world evidence supports that many patients with UC treated with biologic therapy frequently require 
dose increases or need to switch therapies in order to improve disease control. Using a database of chart 
information abstracted by selected gastroenterologists across the US and 5 European Union (EU) 
countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom [UK]), treatment patterns of patients 
with moderate to severe UC with documented administration of biologic agents were examined (Armuzzi, 
2020). Among patients using biologic therapy for greater than 3 months, the dose administered was 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 10/209 
 
 
 
 
greater than the indicated dose or dose frequency (in the US: 37% for infliximab, 13% for adalimumab, 
25% for vedolizumab). In this study, switching therapy was common. For the whole sample size (N = 
1419), 69% of patients were on their second line of therapy and 34% were on their third line of therapy. 
Biologic agents were the most common second line (40%) and third-line therapies (57%). The primary 
reason (> 80%) for switching therapy was efficacy-related (eg, primary or secondary nonresponse).  
Safety concerns related to using anti-TNF agents include serious infections leading to hospitalization or 
death, including tuberculosis, bacterial sepsis, invasive fungal infections, and infections due to 
opportunistic pathogens. Ustekinumab, which inhibits the IL-12/23 p40 subunit, is, like the anti-TNFs, 
also susceptible to loss of response due to anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and is associated with serious and 
opportunistic infections (including reactivation of latent tuberculosis), malignancies, and skin cancers. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported. Vedolizumab is associated with safety 
concerns including injection-related reactions and hypersensitivity, infections including tuberculosis and 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and malignancies. Tofacitinib is the only oral 
immunomodulator approved for moderate to severe UC. While the oral route of administration advanced 
the treatment for patients with moderate to severe UC, tofacitinib is associated with greater risk of 
serious infections, opportunistic infections and herpes zoster infections (including meningoencephalitis, 
ophthalmologic, and disseminated cutaneous infections. In the EU, tofacitinib is to be used with caution in 
patients with known risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE), including prior VTE, major surgery, 
immobilization, myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months, heart failure, combined hormonal 
contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, inherited coagulation disorder, or malignancy. Additional 
VTE risk factors such as age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking status should be considered. 
Surgery with colectomy is curative but can be associated with significant morbidity and is thus reserved 
for acute severe (fulminant) colitis or resistant cases and in some cases as cancer treatment or 
prevention. Intestinal continuity can be restored by construction of an ileo-anal pouch. 
According to the CHMP UC guideline (2018), the goal of treatment of ulcerative colitis is achieving and 
maintaining symptomatic and endoscopic remission. 
About the product 
Ozanimod is an orally bioavailable bi-aryl oxadiazole small molecule that acts as a sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, with 10-fold more selectivity for S1P receptor 1 (SIP1) relative to 
S1P receptor 5 (S1P5). Ozanimod is extensively metabolized in humans to form a number of circulating 
active metabolites including 2 major active metabolites, CC112273 and CC1084037. Approximately 94% 
of circulating total active drug exposure is represented by ozanimod (6%), CC112273 (73%), and 
CC1084037 (15%). 
Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling is involved in multiple immune functions. S1P modulators have the 
potential to treat immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  
The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects is not fully elucidated but may involve 
lymphocyte retention in lymphoid tissues and the reduction of lymphocyte migration to sites of 
inflammation including the central nervous system and intestine. As ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-
mediated inflammatory disease, the retention of lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue has the potential to 
prevent recruitment of additional inflammatory cells, local release of proinflammatory cytokines, and 
ongoing damage to the colonic mucosa. Reduction of this inflammatory response may allow a decrease in 
disease activity and subsequent healing of the mucosa. 
Ozanimod is approved in the United States (US), Europe, and other countries as a treatment for multiple 
sclerosis (MS).

2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice (SA) from the CHMP for the development of the UC programme. 
SA was sought from the Swedish and UK agencies.  
During development, the guidance document for medicinal products to treat patients with UC that was in 
effect at the time clinical program design was CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 dated 2008, prior to the recent 
2018 revision (Guideline on the development of new medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative 
Colitis CHMP/EWP/18463/2006 Rev.1). For this reason, the MAH justifies some post hoc analysis 
presented in the dossier. 
2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
All non-clinical pivotal safety pharmacology and toxicology studies were conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (21 CFR Part 58) and International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) guidelines. The United States is an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) Member Country and adheres to the OECD Mutual Acceptance of Data (MAD) program. 
The clinical studies have been conducted in the USA (the phase I studies) as well globally, involving study 
sides within the EU, as well as outside the EU (North America, South America, Asia, Africa and Australia). 
The applicant confirmed that the clinical trials included were performed in accordance with the principles 
of GCP, as defined by ICH and that the clinical trials carried out outside the EU meet the ethical 
requirements of the Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support the use of Ozanimod in patients with UC in vivo pharmacodynamic studies in rodent models of 
colitis were submitted with this application. Furthermore, an in vitro radioligand binding 
pharmacodynamics (PD) PD-study is submitted which has not been previously assessed during the MAA 
procedure for the MS indication. 
No further new non-clinical studies were submitted with this application. With regard to the non-clinical 
safety, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, the applicant refers to the studies submitted with the 
initial MAA for treatment of MS. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
An in vitro assessment of radioligand binding affinity of ozanimod and metabolites at human 
S1P1 and S1P5 were performed (Report RP-PH-018). This study has not been previously submitted and 
assessed. 
Binding affinity studies were performed in membranes from CHO cells stably expressing human cloned 
S1P1 and S1P5 whereby the ability of ozanimod and its metabolites (CC112273, CC1084037, RP101124, 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 12/209 
 
 
 
 
RP101075, RP101988, RP101442, RP112289, and RP112509) to displace the binding of [3H]-ozanimod by 
50% (IC50) was measured. These IC50 values were converted to inhibition constants (Ki – concentration of 
competing ligand which would occupy 50% of the receptors) using the Cheng Prusoff equation and the 
determined dissociation constant for [3H]-ozanimod (KD – concentration of the radioligand which occupies 
50% of the receptors at equilibrium). In all assays the endogenous ligand, S1P, was used as a reference 
control. Saturation binding analysis determined KD values for ozanimod to be 1.62 nM and 6.56 nM for 
S1P1 and S1P5, respectively. Using these KD values, the Ki values were calculated from the inhibition 
curve IC50’s and it was determined that all active metabolites had inhibition constants in the sub nM range 
for S1P1. The major metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 yielded S1P1 Ki values of 0.29 ± 0.08 nM and 
0.11 ± 0.03 nM, respectively, both similar to ozanimod (0.29 ± 0.04 nM). In agreement with functional 
potencies, the Ki values for S1P5 were higher than for S1P1 and in the 1 – 40 nM range with the major 
metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 yielding S1P5 Ki values of 19.31 ± 1.11 nM and 1.99 ± 0.13 nM, 
respectively with ozanimod at 5.54 ± 0.35 nM (Table 5.2.2.1). RP101124 was unable to compete with 
[3H]-ozanimod at S1P1 or S1P5 (Table 5.2.2.1) suggesting it does not bind within the ozanimod binding 
pocket of S1P1 or S1P5, a clear explanation for its lack of functional activity as assessed using [35S]GTPγS 
binding. Sphingosine 1- phosphate was also competitive with [3H]-ozanimod suggesting that ozanimod 
binds to the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous ligand of S1P1 and S1P5.

The study results suggest that the active metabolites of ozanimod are able to compete for the same 
binding site as the parent molecule within S1P1 and S1P5 and that ozanimod and its active metabolites 
bind to the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous agonist, S1P. 
The potency and intrinsic activity for S1P1 internalization were assessed in response to treatment of S1P1 
expressing cells with ozanimod and downstream circulating active metabolites after multiple different

durations of compound exposure (Report RP-PH-013). The results showed that ozanimod and metabolites 
induced robust receptor internalization at all time points studied with a trend towards increased potency 
with longer duration of test compound exposure. The internalization of S1P1 results in a functional 
antagonism due to the reduced availability of the receptor for further activation. This loss of S1P1 from 
the cell surface contributes to the peripheral mechanism of action of ozanimod and its active metabolites 
and results in retention of lymphocytes in the peripheral lymphoid tissues since the cells can no longer 
sense and follow the S1P gradient between the lymphoid tissue and the systemic circulation. Metabolite 
RP101124 was inactive in that it did not cause S1P1 internalization at any concentration or at any time 
point studied. Ozanimod did not cause internalization of S1P5 with compound exposure for 60 minutes 
followed by immediate assessment, or upon assessment a further 23 hours later. 
Ozanimod and metabolites CC112273 and RP101988 elicit robust intracellular signaling in astrocytes 
isolated from human, mouse, and rat cerebral cortex using AKT and ERK phosphorylation as the readout 
Report RP-PH-004; Report RP-PH-009; and Report RP-PH-012). The results confirm an effect of ozanimod 
on a CNS cell type pertinent to MS pathology. Pharmacological characterization using selective S1P1 and 
S1P5 agonists, including ozanimod, determined this signaling response to be mediated by S1P1 and not 
S1P5 (Report RP-PH-011). 
In vivo pharmacology 
A range of in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted to support the proposed extension of 
indication for treatment of UC. These studies are described and assessed in the following. 
Efficacy of Ozanimod in Rodent Models of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
The objective of these studies was to assess the efficacy of ozanimod in two widely used rodent models of 
inflammatory bowel disease, namely naïve T-cell adoptive transfer in severe combined immunodeficiency 
(SCID) mice and TNBS-induced colitis in rats. The adoptive transfer of naïve CD4+CD45RBhigh T 
lymphocytes from donor mice into SCID mice induces colonic inflammation that develops several weeks 
later. Intra-rectal administration of the hapten, TNBS initiates a mucosal immune response that induces 
colitis by a Th1-mediated immune response (Kiesler, 2015). The efficacy of the active metabolites of 
ozanimod was not directly assessed in either model. 
A summary of the studies in rodent models of IBD is given in table 3.

Table 3: Summary of Findings from Preclinical Studies of Inflammatory Bowel Disease with 
Ozanimod 
Efficacy of Ozanimod in the Severe Combined Immunodeficient Mouse Adoptive Transfer Model 
of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Female SCID mice were each injected intraperitoneally with approximately 4 x 105 splenic 
CD4+CD45RBhigh T lymphocytes isolated from female BALB/c mice. Twenty-one days later, mice were 
randomized into groups of N = 10 based on body weight loss relative to day 0. Once daily oral dosing of 
vehicle (5% DMSO/5% Tween 20 in 0.1N HCl) or ozanimod formulated in vehicle commenced on study 
day 21 and continued for 21 consecutive days thereafter. The positive control, cyclosporine A was 
formulated in 1% carboxymethylcellulose and administered orally once daily. A hamster anti-mouse 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody (TN3-19.12) served as a non-mechanistic positive control and was 
administered at 300 μg per mouse (once-weekly, intraperitoneal). Mice were assessed every other day 
for body weight and clinical observations. Approximately 24 hours after final dose administration, blood 
samples were collected by cardiac puncture (for the measurement of circulating lymphocyte numbers) 
and colons were resected for the measurement of length and wet weight. Colons were then dissected into 
distal and proximal portions and fixed in formalin prior to histopathological assessment. 
In study MCD4-RPT-1, ozanimod was assessed in mice at 1.2 mg/kg (orally administered), a dose which 
approximated the estimated effective dose of 1 mg/kg in mice based on a reduction of circulating 
lymphocyte counts. Figure 5.2.2.1 illustrates that the increase in colon density, indicative of inflammation 
in vehicle-treated mice, was attenuated significantly by 71% in ozanimod-treated mice. This effect was

numerically greater but statistically similar to cyclosporine and TNF-α positive controls (48% – 54% 
attenuation).

This study also included statistical analysis of additional investigative compounds. RPC1063 and 
cyclosporine were administered by oncedaily oral gavage. The anti-TNF Ab was administered by once-
weekly intraperitoneal injection. Group mean values are displayed with error bars denoting SEM. 
In support of an anti-inflammatory effect consistent with engagement of S1P1 pharmacology, mice 
treated with ozanimod exhibited decreased numbers of circulating lymphocytes 24 hours after the final 
dose that were similar to cyclosporine and TNF-α positive controls. Under these conditions, the 41% 
decrease in circulating lymphocytes observed with ozanimod-treated mice is consistent with that 
observed 24 hours post-final dose in EAE mice (Report 20091001-1d) and normal rats (Report RP-PH-
005-1.0 Amendment 1) with a maximum decrease in mice at this dose of approximately 80% (Report RP-
PK-002). 
The individual and summed histological scores of inflammation, gland loss, hyperplasia, neutrophil score, 
and distal mucosal thickness that were all significantly attenuated by ozanimod and both positive controls 
were presented. The distal colon mucosal thickness in SCID mice with adoptive transfer was significantly 
reduced similar to no transfer and the cyclosporine and TNF-α positive controls.

Two additional adoptive transfer inflammatory bowel disease studies were performed in SCID mice with 
ozanimod and are summarized below. 
The dose-response effects of ozanimod (0.3, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg) are detailed in Report MCD4-RPT-3, a 
study performed under the same conditions as Report MCD4-RPT-1. Although the severity of disease was 
greater than in Report MCD4-RPT-1 (e.g., 3.125-fold vs. 2-fold increases in colon density values), 1.2 
mg/kg ozanimod still reduced elevated colon density values significantly by 40% (cf. 71% in MCD4-RPT-
1) comparable to cyclosporine positive control (49%). Although ozanimod at 0.3 mg/kg tended to reduce 
colon density (34%), this was not statistically significant, and the 0.6 mg/kg group did not exhibit a 
similar trend (5%). Erosion of the distal colon and elevated distal colon mucosal thickness were 
attenuated significantly by ozanimod at 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg and levels of inflammatory mediators (IFN-γ, 
IL-12 p70, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α) were also reduced significantly in colon homogenates, in a 
dose-dependent manner (Table 4) and consistent with attenuation of histological inflammation by 
ozanimod at 1.2 mg/kg.

An additional adoptive transfer study (Report MCD4-RPT-4) was conducted under different conditions 
(mice from a different vendor, 49- vs. 42-day duration) and due to a lack of statistically significant 
protection by the positive control cyclosporine, is considered to be a failed study. 
Efficacy of Ozanimod in the 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid (TNBS) Rat Model of 
Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
Male Sprague Dawley rats were fasted for 24 hours, weighed, and randomized into groups (N = 8). 
Inflammation was induced by instilling 64 mg/kg TNBS (5% v/v picrylsulfonic acid, 45% v/v aqueous 
TNBS, 50% v/v ethanol) intra-rectally into the colon under isoflurane anesthesia. Two hours after TNBS 
instillation, cohorts of rats were orally administered vehicle (5% DMSO/5%Tween 20 in 0.1N HCl), 
ozanimod at 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg formulated in vehicle or prednisolone 10 mg/kg (positive control) 
formulated in water. Animals were orally dosed once daily for 7 consecutive days. The doses of ozanimod 
were chosen to span the 0.3 mg dose that significantly lowered lymphocyte counts in rats. Body weight, 
clinical observations, and fecal pellets were assessed daily. Approximately 24 hours after the final dose, 
rats were terminated, and the colons resected. Colon contents were removed, and colon length, weight, 
and wall thickness were measured. A composite “colon disease score” was derived for each rat via 
assessment of the number of adhesions and strictures, the number and size of ulcers, and the colon wall 
thickness (Report IBD-RPI-10). 
During the study, two animals died in each of the TNBS cohorts treated with ozanimod 0.1 mg/kg and 
vehicle. This is not unexpected in this aggressive model with deaths often related to intestinal rupture as 
a result of severe TNBS-induced intestinal inflammation. Both deaths in the vehicle group were associated 
with intestinal rupture and whilst this was not the case for ozanimod at 0.1 mg/kg, both animals had lost 
approximately 30% of their starting body weight and were found dead immediately prior to scheduled 
sacrifice. 
The TNBS vehicle treated group had 18% weight loss over the course of the study. This weight loss was 
dose dependently less in the ozanimod treated groups and this was statistically significant at the 1 mg/kg 
dose. In contrast, body weight loss in the prednisolone positive control group was not different from the 
vehicle control. In addition to maintaining body weight, it is noteworthy that rats in the group treated 
with 1 mg/kg ozanimod were reported to exhibit improved spontaneous behaviors relative to the TNBS

vehicle controls. Moreover in these animals, and those dosed with 0.3 mg/kg, ozanimod significantly and 
dose dependently reduced the increased colon density (≤ 70%; Figure 3) and total colon disease (≤ 
54%; Figure 3) scores induced by TNBS treatment.

An additional rat TNBS study was performed (Report IBD-RPI-11) in which the efficacy of ozanimod at 1 
mg/kg in IBD-RPI-10 was replicated; for example, body weight loss was significantly attenuated (days 1 - 
4, day 6), colon weight gain was reduced by 68% (cf. 50% in Report IBD-RPI-10), and total colon disease 
score was attenuated by 50% (cf. 54% in Report IBD-RPI-10). Furthermore, there was a return to normal 
bowel function by day 3 and similar observations of improved animal health and behavior.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic studies have been performed for the proposed indication for treatment of UC 
and are not deemed necessary by the CHMP. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Single dose toxicity 
No new studies were submitted this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Both, MS and UC are immune mediated chronic diseases. As for treatment of MS, treatment of UC 
requires long-term treatment. The recommended doses and dosing regimen are the same for MS and UC. 
The ozanimod-induced reduction of lymphocytes migration into the CNS and intestine is suggested to be 
involved in the mechanism of its therapeutic effects in MS and UC. There are no meaningful differences in 
the pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with MS or UC. 
Considering these points, the safety studies submitted for the MS indication is also relevant for the UC 
indication. Furthermore, the safety margins calculated for treatment of MS are also applicable for UC. 
No further repeat-dose toxicity studies are considered necessary 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxicity studies have been conducted and submitted for the initial MAA for the MS indication. 
These studies are also sufficient for the new proposed UC indication. 
The information in section 5.3 of the SmPC is appropriate. 
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenicity studies have been conducted and submitted for the initial MAA for the MS indication. 
These studies are also sufficient for the new proposed UC indication. 
The information in section 5.3 of the SmPC is appropriate. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No new data has been submitted in this application. Ozanimod induces embryolethality and teratogenicty 
in rats and rabbits at exposures with low or absent safety margin compared to the human exposure at 
the maximum dose of 0.92 mg ozanimd. Zeposia is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using effective contraception. The existing contraindication during pregnancy 
and in women of childbearing potential is also considered justified for the UC indication. There are 
alternative therapeutics with more experience and/or a better safety profile available for the treatment of 
UC during pregnancy. Therefore, the existing wording in section 4.6 is agreed also in view of the 
extension of indication for treatment of UC.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity assessment identified the expected pharmacological action of decreased circulating

responses. 
Ozanimod and metabolites were negative for in vitro signals of phototoxicity. 
Juvenile 
Repeated Dose Juvenile Toxicity Study in Rats 
Ozanimod was administered via oral gavage to male and female rats at dosage levels of 0.3, 3, and 10 
mg/kg/day for a period of at least 10 weeks beginning on PND 21 (Report 1840-011).   
All animals survived to the scheduled necropsies.  There were no changes that were considered test article-
related  in  clinical  observations,  mean  body  weight,  ophthalmoscopy  examinations,  sexual  maturation, 
learning  and  memory  (as  measured  by  passive  avoidance  evaluations),  coagulation  times,  fibrinogen 
concentration, urinalysis endpoints, bone length and density, or macroscopic observations at necropsy. 
Ozanimod administration resulted in non-adverse treatment-related changes.  These included decreased 
ease  of  removal  from  cage  in  males,  decreased  food  consumption  in  males,  increased  mean  basic 
movement, mean fine movement, and mean total distance in females, decreased circulating lymphocyte 
counts,  increased  chloride  concentration,  and  decreased  mean  absolute  spleen  weights  and  thymus 
weights.   
Histologic  findings  in  this  study  were  similar  to  adult  rats  (pulmonary  alveolar  histiocytosis,  decreased 
corticomedullary ratio of the thymus and depletion of periarteriolar lymphocytes in the spleen).  Similar to 
adult rats, the histologic changes partially to fully reversed following a 2-week non-dosing period.  No new 
target organs were identified in the definitive juvenile rat toxicity study.  In conclusion, the NOAEL was 10 
mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested in this study. 
Immunotoxicology 
Repeated Dose Juvenile Immunotoxicology Study in Rats  
Oral  administration  of  ozanimod  to  juvenile  Sprague-Dawley  rats  was  initiated  at  21  days  of  age  with 
continued daily administration for 33 days (Report 73508) with 14-day recovery groups at doses of 0.3, 3, 
or 10 mg/kg/day.  Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) at 1 mg/mL was administered subcutaneously for a 
total dose of 100 µg/animal/day split equally between 2 dorsal injection sites on Days 7 and 25. 
A dose-dependent decrease in white blood cell counts driven mainly by a decrease in total lymphocytes 
was noted in all ozanimod dose groups.  Both the primary and secondary T-cell dependent anti-KLH IgG 
antibody  responses  (TDAR)  were  inhibited  in  a  statistically  significant  manner  following  ozanimod 
administration by oral gavage at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg/day.  A dose-related decrease in the absolute 
number  of  peripheral  T  and  B  lymphocytes  was  observed  on  Days  14  and  33  after  administration  of 
ozanimod.  These returned toward the control values at the end of the recovery period (Day 47).  Due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 21/209 
 
 
 
 
decreased  TDAR  responses  at  3  mg/kg/day,  the  low  dose  of  0.3  mg/kg/day  was  determined  to  be  the 
NOAEL. 
Repeated Dose Immunotoxicology Study in Adult Rats  
Ozanimod was administered at dose levels of 0.2, 0.7, and 2 mg/kg/day for 33 consecutive days by oral 
gavage  to  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (Report  72864).    Keyhole  Limpet  Hemocyanin  (at  1  mg/mL)  was 
administered subcutaneously to all TDAR animals at a volume of 700 µL/animal on Days 7 and 25.  
An inhibitory effect on both the primary and secondary TDAR was present following administration of the 
test article at the two highest doses; however, there was no statistically significant inhibition observed at 
the lowest ozanimod dose level of 0.2 mg/kg/day.  A dose related decrease (minimal at the low dose) in 
the absolute number of peripheral T and B lymphocytes was observed after administration of ozanimod.  
Slight to moderate increases in the number of circulating natural killer (NK) cells were noted in males while 
no  changes  were  observed  in  females  in  response  to  ozanimod.    Spleen  weights  were  lower  in  the  2 
mg/kg/day group.  Due to the decreased TDAR responses at 0.7 mg/kg/day, the low dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day 
was determined to be the NOAEL. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The purpose of this type II variation is to extend the currently approved indication to include the treatment 
of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The calculation of the Predicted 
Environmental Concentration (PEC) has been based on a systematic review of population-based studies to 
estimate the prevalence. The applicant calculated the prevalence as 285 per 100,000 population based on 
the highest prevalence measured in a European country and the proportion of patients (50%) with moderate 
and  severe ulcerative  colitis.   This  result has  been established  on  a  publication  of  Burisch  (2019)  where 
over the first 5-years disease the proportion of patients (Western Europe [n=591, 82%] and Eastern Europe 
[n=126, 18%) with moderate and severe disease decreased from 41% to 11% from year 1 to year 5. The 
PECSW value for UC is 0.0013 µg/L.  
The  updated  PEC  value  has  been  amended  regarding  the  sum  of  the  PEC-values  for  the  previously 
authorized indication RRMS and new proposed indication (UC). The calculated value (0.0060 μg/L) is below 
the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the use of Ozanimod in patients with UC, in vivo pharmacodynamic studies in rodent models 
of colitis were submitted with this application. Furthermore, an in vitro radioligand binding PD-study is 
submitted which has not been previously assessed. 
No further new non-clinical studies were submitted with this application. With regard to the non-clinical 
safety, pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies, the applicant refers to the studies submitted with the 
initial MAA for treatment of MS. 
The newly submitted in vitro radioligand binding affinity study was performed in membranes from CHO 
cells stabliy expressing human cloned S1P1 and S1P5. The results suggest that the metabolites of 
ozanimod are able to compete for the same binding site as the parent molecule and that ozanimod and its 
metabolites bind to the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous agonist, S1P. These data are 
consistent with those of the previously submitted in vitro studies in that they demonstrate a higher 
activity of ozanimod and metabolites for S1P1 than for S1P5 and show inactivity of the major human 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 22/209 
 
 
 
 
metabolite RP101124. Furthermore, the study provides a deeper insight into the binding site and better 
understanding of the mechanism of action of ozanimod and metabolites. 
The applicant has submitted a range of in vivo pharmacodynamics studies in rodent models of IBD to 
support the proposed indication for treatment of UC. These included studies in naïve T-cell adoptive 
transfer in SCID mice and TNBS-induced colitis in rats. 
In the mouse model ozanimod showed effectiveness at a dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day as demonstrated by 
significant reduction in lymphocytes. Furthermore, histopathology parameters associated with IBD 
(inflammation, gland loss, hyperplasia, neutrophil score, and distal mucosal thickness) and tissue 
cytokine levels were all significantly attenuated by ozanimod at 1.2 mg/kg/day. In a dose response study 
no clear dose-response relationship has been shown. For most parameters the dose of 0.3 mg/kg was 
more effective than the dose of 0.6 mg/kg/day. However, the dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day showed significant 
effectiveness. 
In the rat model ozanimod showed effectiveness at a dose of ≥0.3 mg/kg/day. Ozanimod significantly and 
dose dependently reduced the increased colon density (≤ 70%) and total colon disease (≤ 54%) scores 
induced by TNBS treatment. The dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day has also been shown to reduce lymphocytes in 
rats. 
The studies in animal models of IBD in mice and rats have some limitations as only ozanimod has been 
investigated. No studies have been performed with the metabolites, especially the active human 
metabolites. Difference in the quantitative metabolic profile have been observed between human and 
rodents. For example, in rodents the two major human active metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 
were present at significantly lower levels than in humans. However, evaluation of the active metabolites 
(CC112273, RP101988, RP101075, and RP101442) in EAE mouse model of MS showed efficacy similar to 
that of ozanimod and was associated with a significant reduction (except for CC112273) in lymphocyte 
counts. Furthermore, in vitro studies also demonstrated that the active metabolites all have a similar 
activity profile to the parent compound in that they are potent robust agonists for S1P1 and S1P5 and that 
they are able to compete for the same binding site as the parent molecule within S1P1 and S1P5 by 
binding to the orthosteric binding site for the endogenous agonist, S1P. Therefore, it is highly likely that 
the active metabolites of ozanimod show similar efficacy in the rodent models of IBD. 
No new pharmacokinetic studies have been performed for the proposed indication for treatment of UC 
and are not deemed necessary. There are no meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters 
in patients with MS or UC. 
Further safety studies are also not considered necessary. Both, MS and UC are immune mediated chronic 
diseases. As for treatment of MS, treatment of UC requires long-term treatment and the recommended 
doses and dosing regimens are the same for both indications. The ozanimod-induced reduction of 
lymphocyte migration into the CNS and intestine is suggested to be involved in the mechanism of its 
therapeutic effects in MS and UC. Considering these points, the safety studies submitted for the MS 
indication are also relevant for the UC indication. Furthermore, the safety margins calculated for 
treatment of MS are also applicable for UC. The wording proposed for section 5.3 of the SmPC is agreed. 
According to the SmPC, Zeposia is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential not using effective contraception. Ozanimod induces embryolethality and teratogenicity in rats 
and rabbits at exposures with low or absent safety margin compared to the human exposure at the 
maximum dose of 0.92 mg ozanimd. The vascular findings (generalized edema (anasarca) in the rat and 
great vessel abnormalities in the rabbit) are likely mediated by the S1P1 activity of ozanimod and its 
active metabolites. Therefore, these finding should be regarded as of human relevance. The 
contraindication during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential is considered justified. There 
are alternative therapeutics with more experience and/or a better safety profile available for the 
Assessment report

treatment of UC during pregnancy. Therefore, the wording proposed for section 4.6 is agreed also in view 
of the extension of indication for treatment of UC. 
Zeposia is only indicated for treatment of adult patients with MS and UC. Therefore, the juvenile animal 
studies are currently of lower relevance. However, in these studies no effects different from those seen in 
adults were observed 
Ozanimod HCl is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view there are no objections against the approval of Zeposia for the indication 
“Treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an 
inadequate response, lost response, or are intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent”. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Ozanimod.  
Considering the above data, ozanimod is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Table 7: Clinical Studies Supporting the Efficacy of Ozanimod in Ulcerative Colitis (continued) 
Three ozanimod dosage strengths were prepared for clinical investigation: 0.25 mg ozanimod 
hydrochloride (HCl) (equivalent to 0.23 mg ozanimod), 0.5 mg ozanimod HCl (equivalent to 0.46 mg 
ozanimod), and 1 mg ozanimod HCl (equivalent to 0.92 mg ozanimod). For the ease of reading, doses 
applied in clinical studies are referred to as ozanimod 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively, in the 
efficacy and safety part of this Report. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
One PK interaction study was submitted as part of this variation. Study RPC-1063-CP-001 was conducted 
to assess the impact of cyclosporine, a breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor, on the PK of the 
major active metabolites, CC112273 and CC1084037. This study provided additional data to supplement 
the results from a previously conducted drug interaction study [RPC01-1903]. The study has been 
assessed previously by the CHMP. In this study, coadministration with cyclosporine did not alter ozanimod 
exposure, but caused an approximate 2-fold increase in RP101988 area under the plasma concentration-
time curve from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last). The impact on 
downstream major metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037 was unknown. Both metabolites in vitro were 
determined to not be substrates of BCRP. However, to assess the potential for increased RP101988 
concentrations to lead to changes in the exposure of these downstream metabolites, a second drug 
interaction study (RPC-1063-CP-001) with cyclosporine was conducted.

Study number: RPC-1063-CP-001 
A Phase 1, Randomized, Parallel-group, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Effect of 
Cyclosporine on the Single-dose Pharmacokinetics of Ozanimod and Major Active Metabolites 
in Healthy Adult Subjects  
First subject enrolled: 04 Oct 2019 
Last subject completed: 29 Dec 2019 
Date of report: 22 Sep 2020 
Objectives:  
The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of cyclosporine, an index inhibitor of BCRP, on the 
single-dose PK of ozanimod and its major active metabolites, CC112273 and CC1084037, in healthy adult 
subjects. The assessment of safety and tolerability and of the effect of cyclosporine on the single-dose PK 
of ozanimod’s minor active metabolite, RP101988, were secondary and exploratory objectives 
respectively. 
Study design  
This was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study. 40 healthy male or female subjects (≥ 
18 and ≤ 55 years of age, at least 50 kg, body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2, 
non-smoking within preceding 3 months) were to be enrolled and were to be randomized into 1 of the 2 
treatment groups, with 20 subjects in each treatment group (1:1 randomization, sex as a stratifying 
factor) as follows: 
- 
Treatment Group A (reference): A single oral dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg (one ozanimod 0.46 mg 
capsule) 
- 
 Treatment Group B (test): A single oral dose of cyclosporine 600 mg (six cyclosporine 100 mg 
capsules) followed immediately by a single oral dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg (one ozanimod 0.46 mg 
capsule). 
Table 8: Investigational Products used in Study RPC-1063-CP-001 
The investigational drugs were to be taken with approximately 240 mL of nonrefrigerated, noncarbonated 
water (additional water allowed if required for the subject to complete dosing) following an overnight fast 
of at least 10 hours. Subjects remained fasted and upright (ie, not be allowed to lie down) for 4 hours 
after dosing. 
Eligible subjects were to be domiciled in the clinical research unit from Day -1 until after the last PK 
sample (at 336 hours after ozanimod dosing) was collected. Serial PK blood samples were to be collected 
predose (within 1 hour before ozanimod dosing) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 
Assessment report

120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, 288, 312, and 336 hours following ozanimod dosing. Allowable 
windows for PK sample collection relative to dosing were: ± 10 minutes through 24 hours postdose; and 
± 15 minutes after 24 hours. 
Physical examinations, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements, and clinical 
laboratory tests were to be performed and adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications were to be 
monitored throughout the study to assess safety. A whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample was 
to be collected from all eligible subjects for pharmacogenomic analysis (if warranted). 
Subjects were to be contacted by telephone 60 ± 5 days after the dose of ozanimod for a follow-up safety 
assessment. 
Results: 
For 990 primary samples and 988 duplicate samples received, a total of 990 study samples (no 
duplicates) were analysed for RPC1063, CC112273, CC1084037, and RP101988. 
The results from calibration curve standards and quality control samples met the acceptance criteria, 
demonstrating acceptable performance of the methods throughout the sample analysis period for 15 out 
of 16 runs. Run 9 (Re-injection of Run 8 for instrument qualification) was accepted for CC112273, and 
CC1084037. QCs did not meet acceptance criteria for RPC1063, the instrument was not considered 
qualified. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Plasma drug concentrations and PK parameters were to be summarized descriptively (including arithmetic 
mean, SD, minimum, median, maximum, percent coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric 
coefficient of variation, where appropriate) by treatment group and nominal time point (where 
appropriate). 
The following PK parameters were estimated: Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-tlast, AUC∞  
For ozanimod and RP101988 only: CL/F 
For ozanimod only: Vz/F, t1/2 
The primary PK parameters were Cmax and AUC (AUC∞ for ozanimod and RP101988 and AUClast for 
CC112273 and CC1084037). 
To evaluate the effect of cyclosporine on the PK of ozanimod and its major active metabolites, an analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the natural log-transformed primary PK parameters (Cmax, 
AUClast or AUC0-∞) of ozanimod, CC112273, CC1084037, and RP101988 using the PK Population 
(excluding subjects with major protocol violations that would impact PK assessments). The model 
included treatment group as fixed effect. The least squares geometric means for ozanimod alone (Group 
A, reference) and ozanimod + cyclosporine (Group B, test) was estimated from the model. The ratio (test 
to reference) and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided.  
Statistical methods   
No formal hypothesis testing was planned. Sample size calculation was based on the inter-subject 
variability (coefficient of variation [CV]) of < 48% for Cmax and AUC for ozanimod, CC112273 and 
CC1084037 (RPC01-1912), a sample size of 18 subjects per treatment group (total of 36 subjects) would 
provide estimation of geometric mean ratio (test to reference) of the PK parameters with a 90% CI of 
(0.77, 1.30) assuming the true ratio of 1. 
To account for potential dropout, 20 subjects were to be enrolled within each treatment group.

According to the Applicant the study was designed and monitored in accordance with procedures of the 
Sponsor’s representative, which comply with the ethical principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Applicant states that there were no notable departures 
regarding compliance with applicable international GCP standards or relevant Celgene International II Sàrl 
(CIS II) or representative policies and procedures. It was ensured that monitoring procedures were to be 
performed before, during, and after the study. 
The actual timepoint for data collections were used for the PK analysis. The types of deviations noted 
included: Assessments performed in the incorrect order (vital signs/ECG), Assessments performed out of 
allowable time window (ECG, Vitals Heart Rate, 60 day follow up,), Assessments not performed ( Lab 
Sample at Follow up,), Women not of childbearing potential were given pregnancy tests, Hemolyzed PK 
samples (n =39),  Concomitant medication usage noted with no corresponding AE documented (Tylenol, 
n=1 subject). PK sample time deviations were noted in 12 instances (1 minute, not within 24 hours post 
dose +/- 10 minutes: n=1), ECG not evaluable due to lead reversal, 
Results 
Disposition of Subjects 
Overall, 40 subjects (100%) completed treatment: 20 subjects (100%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group 
and 20 subjects (100%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg group. All 40 subjects (100%) 
were included in the PK and Safety Populations. 
1 subject discontinued from ozanimod + cyclosporin (withdrawal by subject). 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Safety Population) were as follows (overall): 
Age: 39.3 (mean, 19 – 55 years), 25/15 male/female, 1 Asian, 16 Black or African American, 1 Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 22 White, weight: 74.77 (52.5 – 90.3 kg), height: 169.7 (154.2 – 
181.5 cm), BMI 26.10 (19.3 – 29.9 kg/m2) with little differences between the groups. 
No subject reported receiving prior medications. Two subjects receiving ozanimod 0.46 mg and 6 subjects 
receiving ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg received concomitant medications during the study 
for AEs. In addition, one subject receiving ozanimod 0.46 mg received paracetamol for an unspecified 
indication. 
Pharmacokinetic results: 
Mean plasma ozanimod, CC112273, CC1084037, and RP101988 concentration-time profiles by treatment

Table 10: Statistical analysis to assess the effect of cyclosporine on the PK of ozanimod and 
metabolites 
Since AUCinf was not reported for RP101988 in 13 out of 20 subjects in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group due 
to AUC%extra exceeding 20%, this parameter was excluded from the statistics. 
Cmax, AUC 0- t, and AUC 0-inf 
Coadministration with cyclosporine had no effect on the Cmax of ozanimod and resulted in a numerical 
increase of 19% in mean ozanimod AUCinf. Cyclosporine decreased the mean Cmax of CC112273 
numerically by approximately 14% with little effect on the AUClast of CC112273 and on either the 
AUClast or Cmax of CC1084037. 
The 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means for Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-∞ encompasses 1 for 
ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037, indicating there was no statistically significant difference in 
exposure of ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037 with or without cyclosporine coadministration. 
Cyclosporine significantly increased Cmax and AUC0-last for RP101988 by 96% and 75%, respectively. 
The median Tmax (10.0 hours) of ozanimod was similar between treatments. Mean ozanimod t½ (19 to 
21 hours) and Vz/F (4950 to 5176 L) were similar between treatments and CL/F was slightly lower (172 
L/h) when ozanimod was coadministered with cyclosporine than when administered alone (205 L/h). The 
median Tmax of CC112273 (20.0 vs 10.0 hours) and CC1084037 (36.0 vs 24.0 hours) was later following 
ozanimod coadministration with cyclosporine; however, the range of individual Tmax was similar for both 
treatments. The mean CC112273 t½ (282 to 285 hours) and CC1084037 (272 to 390 hours) were similar 
across treatments. The median Tmax (6.0 hours) of RP101988 was similar between treatments. The 
mean RP101988 t½ (13 to 15 hours) was also similar for both treatments.

Overall, 15 subjects (37.5%) had at least 1 TEAE. The majority of the TEAEs occurred in the ozanimod 
0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg group: 2 subjects (10.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group and 13 
subjects (65.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg group. 
The majority of TEAEs related to ozanimod were reported by the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 
mg group: 0 subjects in the ozanimod 0.46 mg group and 5 subjects (25.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg + 
cyclosporine 600 mg group. Seven subjects (35.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg 
group had at least 1 TEAE that was related to cyclosporine. 
Eight subjects reported TEAEs that were not related to IP: 2 subjects (10.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg 
group and 6 subjects (30.0%) in the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg group. 
All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. There were no TEAEs that were considered SAEs, no SAEs 
related to IP, no TEAEs that led to discontinuation of IP or deaths. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs in ≥ 2 subjects for the ozanimod 0.46 mg + cyclosporine 600 mg 
group were nausea, diarrhoea, feeling hot, and headache. In the ozanimod 0.46 mg group, no TEAE was 
reported by more than 1 subject. 
Sporadic out-of-range chemistry and hematology laboratory parameters were reported but no trends in 
mean laboratory results were noted, no notable trends or changes from baseline in vital signs were 
observed, no physical examination findings were reported as AEs. No ECG results with abnormal clinically 
significant findings were reported. 
A single oral dose of ozanimod 0.46 mg, administered alone or in combination with a single oral dose of 
cyclosporine 600 mg, was generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Based on previously submitted data in healthy subjects, administration of increasing doses of ozanimod in 
healthy subjects was associated with dose dependent reductions in ALC, a PD biomarker of S1P1 
modulation. Following once-daily administration of 0.3, 1, and 1.5 mg ozanimod for 28 days in healthy 
subjects, the median ALC reductions from baseline were 34%, 65%, and 68%, respectively (MS SCP). 
These data suggested that doses of 1 mg achieve near maximal ALC reduction. 
The new data submitted concern a retrospective analysis of stored samples from a clinical pharmacology 
study with intensive sampling in patients with MS (RPC01-1001) which was analysed for differential 
changes to leukocyte subpopulations. 
In addition, the applicant has submitted Study RPC01-1915, which is formally a Phase 1, Multi-center, 
Extension Study to Further Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Ozanimod 
and Active Metabolitesin Healthy Adult Subjects of which the primary objective was to obtain safety data 
up to 75 ± 10 days postdose from the Phase 1 protocols RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, and RPC-1914. This 
study also includes information on PD during the recovery phase after repeated ozanimod dosing in 
healthy adult subjects relating to normalisation of lymphocyte counts. 
Mechanism of action 
Based on previously submitted data in healthy subjects, administration of increasing doses of ozanimod in 
healthy subjects was associated with dose dependent reductions in ALC, a PD biomarker of S1P1 
modulation. Following once-daily administration of 0.3, 1, and 1.5 mg ozanimod for 28 days in healthy 
subjects, the median ALC reductions from baseline were 34%, 65%, and 68%, respectively (MS SCP). 
These data suggested that doses of 1 mg achieve near maximal ALC reduction.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Study RPC01-1001: 
Study RPC01-1001 was an open-label randomized PK and PD study evaluating administration of 0.5 mg 
(n = 13) and 1 mg (n = 11) ozanimod, following a 7-day dose escalation, for 12 weeks in patients with 
RMS. A supplementary analysis of this study is now submitted. 
The results of this supplementary analysis are not included in the study report (which dates December 
2017 and was included in the initial submission already), but are provided by a publication (Harris S et al: 
Effect of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator ozanimod on leukocyte subtypes in relapsing 
MS; Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm 2020;7:e839.) 
Eligible participants in this study had no history of relapse with onset from 30 days before screening until 
randomization, were clinically stable during this period without systemic corticosteroid or 
adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment, and had documentation of positive varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody status or complete VZV vaccination at least 30 days before study entry. 
In addition, they were required to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0–6 and be generally 
healthy aside from RMS. Key exclusion criteria included active infection or history of chronic infections or 
immunodeficiency, recent live vaccination, previous lymphocyte-depleting or immunosuppressant 
therapy, and ALC <1.000 × 109/L or white blood cell count <3.500 × 109/L. 
As a pre-specified pharmacodynamic analysis, the ALC was evaluated on days 1, 5, 8, 28, 56, and 85 
(end of treatment). This analysis was included in the previously submitted study report as of 2017.  
Two further analyses are included in the newly submitted literature data for the exploration of leucocyte 
subpopulation behaviour in this population, flow cytometry and epigenetic cell counting: 
The flow cytometry panel was used to characterize circulating leukocyte subsets at baseline (day 1) and 
days 28, 56, and 85. Analyzed subsets included CD19+ B cells,CD3+ T cells, monocytes, natural killer 
(NK) cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells, as well as the following T-cell subtypes: CD4+ and CD8+ 
central and effector memory T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ naive T cells, and CD8+ terminally differentiated 
effector T cells expressing CD45RA (TEMRA). 
The epigenetic cell counting was performed using bisulfite-converted deoxyribonucleic acid from frozen 
whole blood samples as substrate for quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays for selected cell type-
specific demethylated loci (B cells, T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, CD4+ T helper cells, Regulatory T cells, 
Th17 cells, Naïve CD8+ T cells, and PD1 cells). 
Flow cytometry analysis of circulating leukocyte subsets indicated that the dose-dependent decreases in 
ALCs with ozanimod treatment were primarily due to decreases in circulating CD19+ B cells and CD3+ T 
cells as shown in the following figure. There were minimal to no decreases in monocytes, NK, and NKT 
cells.

Figure 5: Circulating Levels of B Cells (A) and T Cells (B) during Ozanimod Treatment 
Further analysis of specific T-cell subtypes revealed greater decreases in CD4+ T-helper cells than CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells in the ozanimod HCl 1 mg group, as well as greater decreases in both CD4+ and CD8+ 
central memory T cells versus effector memory T cells. By the end of treatment, ozanimod HCl 1 mg 
reduced mean CD4+ and CD8+ naïve T cells by ≥ 90%; ozanimod did not reduce circulating CD8+ 
TEMRA. 
Study RPC01-1915: 
This study is termed “A phase 1, multi-center, extension study to further evaluate the safety, 
pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of ozanimod and active metabolites in healthy adult subjects”.  
The primary objective was to obtain safety data up to 75 ± 10 days post-dose from the Phase 1 protocols 
RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, and RPC-1914. The secondary objective was to collect additional data to 
further characterize the PD during the recovery phase after repeated ozanimod dosing in healthy adult 
subjects. The study reports of the three mentioned studies had been submitted with the initial 
application. 
This study was to consist of 2 parts: 
- 
Mandatory data collection for safety: Subjects enrolled in the parent studies were to be consented 
to have data on adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), pregnancy test results, and concomitant 
medications up to the 75 ± 10 days post-dose follow-up collected and reported in this study. 
- 
Optional sparse sampling for PK/PD: Eligible subjects from studies RPC01-1913 and RPC01-1914 
were to be offered the opportunity to return to the clinical research unit (CRU) on 4 separate occasions 
for PK/PD sample collections up to the 75 ± 10 days postdose follow-up. After signing the ICF, eligible 
subjects were to be randomized to 1 of 3 sequences for sampling (see below). Subjects were to return to 
the CRU in the morning (between approximately 8 am and 11 am) once at each of the 4 time windows.

Table 11: RPC01-1915 Study Sequence 
A total of 232 subjects participated in the mandatory part of the study (Safety Population); 100 from 
parent study RPC01-1912, 79 from parent study RPC01-1913, and 53 from parent study RPC01-1914. 
A total of 58 subjects (23 from parent study RPC01-1913 and 35 from parent study RPC01-1914) 
participated in the optional part of the study (Randomized Population) and were randomized to 1 of 3 
sequences (as given above). 
Results: 
Overall, no new safety findings were observed in this extension study compared to the parent studies 
RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, and RPC01-1914. 
For the optional part of the study, 19, 18, and 21 patients were randomised in the three sequences. 
Patient groups were comparable for their mean demographic characteristics at study entry. 
A total of 55 subjects (94.8%) in the optional part of the study (19 [100.0%], 17 [94.4%], and 19 
[90.5%] subjects in Sequence 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were included in the Pharmacodynamic 
Population. A total of 3 subjects (5.2%) in the optional part of the study (1 subject [5.6%] in Sequence 2 
and 2 subjects [9.5%] in Sequence 3) were excluded as they did not have at least 1 PD datum. 
Spaghetti plots of ALC at baseline and up to 85 days after the last dose by treatment for RPC01-1913 and 
RPC01-1914 are presented in the following 2 figures. Baseline was the measurement prior to 
ozanimod/phenelzine/placebo dosing (Day 11) for parent study RPC01-1913 and the measurement on 
Day -2 for parent study RPC01-1914.

The following excerpts from the tables provided in the study report do give a more clear impression on 
the magnitude of changes over time. The evaluation of the data is complicated by the fact that not all 
samples in both studies were taken at the same time (due to the design of study 1913). Data are given 
for baseline of both studies, for the time period 28-34 days after end of treatment (study RPC01-1913 
only), for the time period 49-55 days after the end of treatment (both studies) and for the last period 
(day 65 to 85).

The applicant concludes that after multiple dosing of ozanimod 1.84 mg once daily for up to 28 days 
(preceded by the 10-day dose escalation of 0.23 mg for 4 days, 0.46 mg for 3 days, and 0.92 mg for 3 
days), ALC appeared to return to near baseline by 65 to 85 days after the last dose of ozanimod.

Cells 
In the epigenetic cell-counting analysis, total circulating leukocytes at Day 85 were reduced to 90% (95% 
CI: 78%, 104%) and 73% (95% CI: 55%, 97%) of baseline in the ozanimod HCl 0.5 mg and 1 mg 
groups, respectively. Results for specific leukocyte subsets were consistent with the flow cytometry 
results in showing dose-dependent decreases in total circulating B cells and T cells with ozanimod 
treatment, as well as decreases in CD4+ T-helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and naive CD8+ T cells. 
This analysis also demonstrated greater reductions in Th17 cells than T regulatory cells or programmed 
cell death 1 (PD-1)+ cells.

Figure 9: Epigenetic Cell Counting: Circulating Levels of Th17 versus T Regulatory Cells 
The applicant concludes that ozanimod dosed once daily induced differential changes to leukocyte 
subpopulations. Ozanimod caused greater reductions in CD4+ cells than CD8+ T cells, and greater 
decreases in central memory T cells versus effector memory T cells. In contrast, ozanimod had minimal 
impact on monocytes, NK, and NKT cells, which are important components of the innate immune 
response and maintenance of immunosurveillance. 
Study RPC01-1915: 
This study is termed “A phase 1, multi-center, extension study to further evaluate the safety, 
pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of ozanimod and active metabolites in healthy adult subjects”.  
The primary objective was to obtain safety data up to 75 ± 10 days post-dose from the Phase 1 protocols 
RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, and RPC-1914. The secondary objective was to collect additional data to 
further characterize the PD during the recovery phase after repeated ozanimod dosing in healthy adult 
subjects. The study reports of the three mentioned studies had been submitted with the initial 
application. 
This study was to consist of 2 parts: 
- 
Mandatory data collection for safety: Subjects enrolled in the parent studies were to be consented 
to have data on adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), pregnancy test results, and concomitant 
medications up to the 75 ± 10 days post-dose follow-up collected and reported in this study. 
- 
Optional sparse sampling for PK/PD: Eligible subjects from studies RPC01-1913 and RPC01-1914 
were to be offered the opportunity to return to the clinical research unit (CRU) on 4 separate occasions 
for PK/PD sample collections up to the 75 ± 10 days post dose follow-up. After signing the ICF, eligible 
subjects were to be randomized to 1 of 3 sequences for sampling (see below). Subjects were to return to 
the CRU in the morning (between approximately 8 am and 11 am) once at each of the 4 time windows.

Table 13: RPC01-1915 Study Sequence 
A total of 232 subjects participated in the mandatory part of the study (Safety Population); 100 from 
parent study RPC01-1912, 79 from parent study RPC01-1913, and 53 from parent study RPC01-1914. 
A total of 58 subjects (23 from parent study RPC01-1913 and 35 from parent study RPC01-1914) 
participated in the optional part of the study (Randomized Population) and were randomized to 1 of 3 
sequences (as given above). 
Results: 
Overall, no new safety findings were observed in this extension study compared to the parent studies 
RPC01-1912, RPC01-1913, and RPC01-1914. 
For the optional part of the study, 19, 18, and 21 patients were randomised in the three sequences. 
Patient groups were comparable for their mean demographic characteristics at study entry. 
A total of 55 subjects (94.8%) in the optional part of the study (19 [100.0%], 17 [94.4%], and 19 
[90.5%] subjects in Sequence 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were included in the Pharmacodynamic 
Population. A total of 3 subjects (5.2%) in the optional part of the study (1 subject [5.6%] in Sequence 2 
and 2 subjects [9.5%] in Sequence 3) were excluded as they did not have at least 1 PD datum. 
Spaghetti plots of ALC at baseline and up to 85 days after the last dose by treatment for RPC01-1913 and 
RPC01-1914 are presented in the following 2 figures. Baseline was the measurement prior to 
ozanimod/phenelzine/placebo dosing (Day 11) for parent study RPC01-1913 and the measurement on 
Day -2 for parent study RPC01-1914.

The following excerpts from the tables provided in the study report do give a more clear 
impression on the magnitude of changes over time. The evaluation of the data is complicated 
by the fact that not all samples in both studies were taken at the same time (due to the design 
of study 1913). Data are given for baseline of both studies, for the time period 28-34 days 
after end of treatment (study RPC01-1913 only), for the time period 49-55 days after the end 
of treatment (both studies) and for the last period (day 65 to 85).

The applicant concludes that after multiple dosing of ozanimod 1.84 mg once daily for up to 28 days 
(preceded by the 10-day dose escalation of 0.23 mg for 4 days, 0.46 mg for 3 days, and 0.92 mg for 3 
days), ALC appeared to return to near baseline by 65 to 85 days after the last dose of ozanimod. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Two separate models were developed to analyse plasma concentrations of ozalimod and of the metabolite 
CC112273 over time using new data for UC patients, starting out from the existing models developed for 
healthy volunteers and RMS patients. The resulting Pop-PK-Model was used to develop a PK/PD model 
describing the correlations between metabolite concentration and ALC decrease over time using an Emax 
model. Further, an exposure-response model was developed describing how CC112273 AUC could be 
linked to Efficacy (Clinical remission) using logistic regression. Regarding safety, time-to-event analyses 
were conducted for the endpoints AST/ALT elevation and infections, analysing data separately for week 
10 and week 52.

Population PK modeling 
Also in the previous population PK analysis for patients with RMS, ozanimod and CC112273 were 
characterized by two separate models. The PK of CC112273 was described by a 2-compartment model 
with first order formation rate, a lag time and first order elimination. The evaluated full model included 45 
covariate effects, and 12 of which were retained in the final model. The PK model developed for ozanimod 
was also a 2-compartment model with combined zero and first order absorption processes. Significant 
covariates included age and body weight on apparent clearance. The overall PK profiles were not 
expected to be different between RMS patients and UC patients. Hence, population PK analysis was 
performed for ozanimod, the parent drug, and CC112273, the most prominent circulating active moiety, 
using the models developed for RMS population, with evaluation of a disease effect to account for any 
differences between patients and healthy volunteers.  
Subjects from 11 studies (Phase 1 to Phase 3) were included for the population PK analysis. PK 
population included healthy volunteers, RMS patients and UC patients. A total of 18901 PK concentrations 
from 2890 subjects were included in the PK analysis of CC112273 and 18834 PK concentrations from 
2977 subjects were included in the PK analysis of ozanimod. Population PK analysis was performed on 
ozanimod and its most prominent metabolite CC112273 using 2-compartment models previously 
developed in RMS patients and adapted to the studied population. Sources of variability were explored, 
previously selected covariates were retained and a formal covariate analysis was performed using a full-
model approach on new potential covariates. The final model was qualified using goodness-of-fit criteria, 
sampling importance resampling, and visual predictive check. Empirical individual Bayesian estimates of 
PK parameters were generated using the final population PK model. Based on individual parameter 
estimates, measures of ozanimod and CC112273 exposures were computed for each subject. 
For the purpose of the analysis, included were two Phase 2 and Phase 3 UC studies (RPC01-202, RPC01-
3101); three RMS studies for disease comparison (RPC01-1001, RPC01-201B and RPC01-301); and six 
Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers that included analysis of the active major 
metabolite CC112273 (RPC01-1910, -1911, -1912, -1913, -1914 and -1915).  
The analysis was performed using NONMEM (Version 7.4 or greater), with the first-order conditional 
estimation (FOCE) and the INTERACTION option. Perl-Speaks-NONMEM (PsN Version 4.6.0 or greater) 
and FORTRAN compiler (V4.6 or greater) were used during PK modeling evaluation, and the results were 
further analyzed by R® software (Version 3.6 or greater). Exploratory analyses were performed using R 
software (Version 3.6 or greater).  
PPK Analysis of CC112273 
A total of 3031 subjects with CC112273 PK samples were available in the PPK dataset of which total of 
18901 (83.0%) concentrations were included in the PPK analysis of CC112273. 
CC112273 concentrations were determined retrospectively in frozen plasma samples retained from all or 
subsets of the subjects who participated in Studies RPC01-1001, RPC01-201B, RPC01-301, RPC01-201, 
and RPC01-3101. For these studies, only concentration values within the long-term stability established in 
March 2020 (CC112273: 961 days) were included in this analysis. This is the reason for exclusion of 
87.1% of the samples collected in UC study RPC01-202. 
The PK population included 1257 (43.5%) male and 1633 (56.5%) female subjects. Median (range) age 
and body weight were 36.0 years (18.0 to 74.0 years) and 70.0 kg (37.8 to 173 kg), respectively. The 
subjects were primarily white (91.7%). The majority of subjects had normal hepatic and renal functions 
(90.7% and 69.9%, respectively). The population included 459 (15.9%) smokers. Overall, there were 
259 (9.0%) healthy volunteers, 885 (30.6%) subjects with UC and 1746 (60.4%) subjects with RMS.

The overall approach for the development of the metabolite PPK model followed standard methods: The 
base model was based upon the previously developed model. The base model included the covariates 
previously determined to have a significant effect on model parameters. An interindividual variability (IIV) 
on the bioavailability (F1) parameter was added to the model. The disease effect on error was evaluated. 
The potential effect of additional covariates was assessed by a full model approach. A final model was 
determined by backward elimination of added covariates in the full model. 
Table 15: Samples Included in the CC112273 PPK Analysis Dataset 
Figure 12: Structural PK Model of CC112273 
Natural-log-transformed concentration-time profiles of CC112273 were previously described by a first-
order input with a fixed-length lag time (TLAG) and 2-compartment disposition. This structural model was 
used to describe the relationship between CC112273 concentrations and time. 
The IIV was modeled as an exponential random-effect model in order to positively constrain the individual 
parameter values, which were thus assumed to follow a log-normal distribution. 
Residual variability was described using statistical model with additive component. A disease effect 
(subjects with RMS or UC versus healthy subject) on residual variability was evaluated and significantly

Page 48/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improved the model predictions. Different residual error estimates were then added for the subjects with 
RMS/UC group and the healthy group. 
Only the covariates that are deemed significant (ie, a decrease >6.63 in objective function value [OFV], 
p-value=0.01) were included in the full model. In the full model, covariates were statistically insignificant 
if the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the covariate effect parameter include the null value (1 for 
categorical and 0 for continuous). Covariates are considered clinically unimportant if the 95% CIs of the 
covariate effect is within 25% of the null value. The list of covariates tested in the full model is presented 
in Table 17. 
The final model was derived from the full model using stepwise backward elimination (p-value=0.001). 
For each step, a covariate that was deemed insignificant (ie, an increase >10.83 in OFV, p-value=0.001) 
was removed from the model for the following step. The final model was then derived from the full 
covariate and is considered to have the lowest OFV determined by backward elimination from the full 
model. However, as noted in the previous section, inferences on the magnitude of covariate effects were 
based on the full model.  
Empirical Bayesian Estimate (EBE) PK parameters and summary exposure metrics were estimated from 
the final PPK model for each subject at a dose of 1mg of ozanimod. These parameters were summarized 
by disease type and presented in the table below for the primary PK parameters and for the secondary PK 
parameters. 
Stepwise backward elimination was performed on the 3 added covariates (age and race on CL/F and 
disease status on KA), summarized in Table 16. All covariates were significant, and the final model 
remained similar to the full model. Parameter estimates of the full/final model and the SIR are presented 
below. 
GOF plots of the final PPK model are presented in figures below.

Statistically significant covariates (95% CI excluded the null value) include body weight, age, bilirubin 
levels, sex, race, disease status, smoking status and hepatic impairment on CL/F, body weight, sex and 
hepatic impairment on VC/F and body weight, sex, disease status and hepatic impairment on KA. The 
overall apparent clearance of CC112273 in RMS population is slightly higher (<20%) than UC population, 
which resulted in slightly lower exposure (e.g. AUCss or Cmaxss) in RMS population than in UC 
population. 
The most influential covariate on CL/F is smoking status. The smokers appear to have higher (~108%) 
apparent clearance of CC112273 than non-smokers. Although with limited number of non-white subjects 
(<10% of total subjects), the apparent clearance of CC112273 in non-white subjects is ~30% lower than 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 54/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the white subjects. The apparent clearance of CC112273 in female subjects is moderately lower (~33%) 
than male subjects. The apparent clearance of CC112273 only slightly decreases with increasing age. The 
typical CL of a 57-year old subject accounts for about 90% of that of a 36-year subject. The apparent 
clearance of CC112273 also slightly decreases as body weight increases. The typical CL of a 102-kg 
subject accounts for about 85% of the CL in a 70-kg subject. 
PPK Analysis of Ozanimod 
The approach for model development of the ozanimod PPK was similar to the strategy used for the 
metabolite CC112273. 
A total of 3057 subjects with ozanimod PK samples were available in the PPK dataset. Of these, 60 
subjects did not have quantifiable post dose concentrations and 20 subjects were flagged for exclusion. 
These subjects were not considered in the descriptive statistics or the PPK analysis of ozanimod. Overall, 
2977 subjects were included in the PPK analysis of ozanimod. 
A total of 18834 (86.5%) concentrations were included in the PPK analysis of ozanimod. PK population for 
ozanimod analysis was slightly different from the PK population of CC112273 due to differences in 
samples availability and exclusions. More samples from study RPC01-202 (74.2 %) than for the 
metabolite model were included because there were no exclusions due to stability issues for ozanimod. 
The previous model included the covariate effects of age and body weight on CL/F that were kept in the 
current structural model development. An IIV was estimated for KA, CL/F, VC/F, and D1. A disease effect 
(subjects with RMS or UC versus healthy subject as a reference) on residual variability was also evaluated 
and significantly improved the model predictions. 
Model evaluation with GOF plots and VPCs demonstrated robust stability and predictive performance of 
the final PPK model. The typical CL/F and VC/F of ozanimod for a white, male, non-smoker, UC patients 
with a body weight of 70kg and an age of 36 years, bilirubin levels of 7 umol/L, ALT of 15 U/L, eGFR of 
99.9 mL/min/1.73m2 were 174 L/h and 120 L, respectively. 
Ozanimod concentration-time profiles are well characterized with a 2-compartment model with mixed 
zero and first order absorption and first order elimination rates. Statistically significant covariates include 
body weight, age, eGFR, bilirubin levels and disease status on CL/F, disease status on VC/F and body 
weight, sex and disease status on KA. The overall apparent clearance of ozanimod is lower in RMS 
population (<10%) than UC population, which resulted in similar exposures (e.g. AUCss and Cmaxss) in 
both populations. The most influential covariate on ozanimod apparent clearance is body weight. The 
typical apparent clearance of ozanimod in a 102-kg subject increases about 23% relative to a 70-kg 
subject. PPK final model parameter estimates are shown in the following table:

The typical terminal elimination half-life was 38.8 hours; with complete elimination expected after 
approximately 8 days. From the previous model developed, body weight and age were identified as 
statistically significant covariates of CL/F. Overall, 3 covariates indicated an important effect on PK 
parameter estimates, specifically the VC/F and CL/F. These include disease type, particularly the RMS 
group compared to the UC group, and the effect of age on VC/F and body weight on CL/F. The VC/F is 
expected to be lower in subjects with RMS compared to subjects with UC, and lower in younger subjects. 
Subjects with a lower body weight are also expected to have a lower CL/F. 
Other covariates remained statistically significant following a stepwise backward elimination. These 
include an effect of eGFR and bilirubin on CL/F and an effect of body weight, sex, and disease type on KA. 
However, these have a very small exponent, indicative of a minor change in parameter estimates. 
PK/PD modelling 
The analyses consist of a population PK/PD analysis between CC112273 and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC); E-R analysis for clinical remission in the induction phase and maintenance phase as an efficacy 
endpoint; and E-R analysis for alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
infections as an efficacy endpoint. 
Population PK-PD Analysis of Peripheral ALC 
Subjects from 11 studies (Phase 1 to Phase 3) were included for the population PK-PD analysis. The 
analysis population included healthy volunteers, RMS patients and UC patients. A total of 34449 ALC 
measurements from 4122 subjects were included in the analysis. Population PK-PD analysis was 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 56/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performed on ALC using post-hoc PK parameter estimates for the ozanimod metabolite CC112273 and a 
direct effect PK-PD model that was developed previously in RMS patients. Sources of variability were 
exploredusing standard methods. The final model was qualified using goodness-of-fit criteria and visual 
predictive checks (VPC). 
The PK-PD analysis of ALC showed a maximum saturable decrease from baseline ALC between 68% and 
85%, and the CC112273 concentration required to achieve 50% of the maximal decrease between 1.3 
and 3.8 nmol/L. Females have a larger maximum effect (9.5%) than males. Compared to UC patients, 
healthy subjects and RMS patients have a larger (4.4%) and a smaller (-7.7%) maximum effect, 
respectively. A larger body weight was associated with a larger maximum effect, compared to a subject 
with median body weight of 69.9 kg. 
The estimated parameters from the final model are presented in table below. The RSE% of the typical 
values are less than 6% and are less than 3% for the between subjects variability parameters. The only 
parameter that is not statistically significant is healthy on Emax (compared to UC), it was kept in the 
model because it was tested simultaneously as health status with RMS on Emax and it was statistically 
significant to keep both parameters in the final model. 
Goodness-of-fit plots of the ALC final model by subject type are shown in Figure 16. The ALC prediction-
corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) plots are presented in Figure 17 (versus CC112273 semi-
logarithmic), and in Figure 18 (versus time).  
Figure 19 presents the typical ALC versus CC112273 concentrations for the subject types. Because both 
Emax and EC50 have disease as a covariate, a difference between the curves can be seen. Healthy 
subjects have the larger Emax, and RMS patients have the smaller Emax. RMS patients seem to have a 
smaller EC50, and healthy subjects, a larger EC50.

Exposure-Response Model – Efficacy (Clinical Remission) 
Subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC) from a single Phase 3 study were included for the Exposure-Response 
analysis of clinical remission. Separate evaluations of clinical remission was performed for the induction 
phase (Week 10) and the maintenance phase (Week 52). There were a total of 1012 subjects included in 
the induction phase and 526 subjects in the maintenance phase. Logistic regression analyses were 
performed to develop a model describing the relationship between the steady state exposure CC112273 
(AUCss), and the probability of clinical remission at Week 10 or Week 52. The impact of other prognostic 
factors were evaluated using a full model approach with a stepwise backward deletion to arrive at a final 
model. The final model was qualified with visual predictive checks.  
The efficacy E-R at Week 10 (or induction phase) showed a difference in clinical remission rate between 
subjects that received placebo and those that received ozanimod. However, the E-R was relatively flat 
across all exposure levels for subjects that received 1 mg ozanimod. The efficacy E-R at Week 52 (or 
maintenance phase) showed a clear difference in clinical remission rate between subjects that received 
placebo and those that received ozanimod. However, the E-R was relatively flat across all exposure levels 
for subjects that received 1 mg ozanimod. 
Following elimination of nonsignificant predictors, the final model included CC112273 AUCss, baseline 
Mayo score, prior Anti-TNF use, and corticosteroid use as predictors of clinical remission. The reference 
individual has a baseline Mayo score of 9, no prior anti-TNF use, no corticosteroid use, and a steady-state 
CC112273 AUC of 204 nM*hr for subjects that received ozanimod. The probability of clinical remission for 
a reference individual receiving placebo is 15.1%, and for a reference individual receiving ozanimod is 
43.3%.

The final model for Week 10 clinical remission exposure response showed a difference in response 
between subjects treated with placebo or ozanimod, with higher response rates in the ozanimod 
treatment group. Across the range of exposures from the 1 mg ozanimod dose, the Week 10 clinical 
remission response rate was similar, with a slight trend toward greater response with higher exposure. 
The probability of clinical remission at Week 10 was 6% for a reference individual receiving placebo and 
24.7% for a reference individual receiving ozanimod. 
The final model for Week 52 clinical remission exposure response showed that across the range of 
exposures from the 1 mg ozanimod dose, the Week 52 clinical remission response rate was similar. 
The response rate was lower in the placebo treatment group than the ozanimod treatment group. The 
probability of clinical remission at Week 52 was 15.1% for a reference individual receiving placebo and 
43.3% for a reference individual receiving ozanimod.

Logistic Regression 
Exposure-Response Analysis of Safety  
Subjects from two Phase 2 studies (RMS patients) and one Phase 3 study (UC patients) were included for 
the exposure-response analysis of elevated ALT and/or AST levels and infections and infestations. 
Separate evaluations of each safety endpoint (ALT/AST and Infections/Infestations) was performed for 
the induction phase (Week 10) and the maintenance phase (Week 52). There were a total of 2750 
subjects included in the induction phase (includes both RMS and UC) and 526 subjects in the 
maintenance phase (UC only). Time-to-event analyses were performed for the probability of first event 
for each endpoint. The impact of other prognostic factors were evaluated using a full model approach with 
a stepwise backward deletion to arrive at a final model. The final model was qualified with visual 
predictive checks. 
Time-to-event analyses were performed for the probability of first event for each endpoint. For the time 
of first categorical event after the beginning of the treatment, Kaplan-Meier plots were derived for E-R 
evaluation according to exposure quartiles. Cox Regression results for the time to event analyses for each 
safety endpoint were derived based on exposure levels of CC112273 in patients with UC or RMS. 
The final model was derived from the full model using backward elimination (using Bayesian information 
criteria]). 
Safety E-R of ALT and/or AST 
A low incidence rate for both the induction and maintenance phases was shown, and across the range of 
CC112273 exposures from 0.5 mg to 1 mg ozanimod QD, the relative risk of AEs remained low. The 
ALT/AST endpoint was defined as the first observation of either an ALT or an AST value that exceeded 3 
times the upper limit of normal. 
Visual predictive checks of the time-to-event profiles for ALT/AST elevations during the induction phase 
(Week 10) were prepared for induction phase and maintenance phase (Figure 22 and Figure 23). There 
was an overprediction of the incidence rate from Day 300 through Day 650; however, the overall 
probability of an ALT/AST elevation was low (<15%).

The hazard ratios from the final model are presented in Table 24 for induction phase and in Table 25 for 
maintenance phase. The predicted probability of an ALT/AST elevation at Week 10 for UC patients across 
a range of steady-state CC112273 exposures is shown in Figure 22Figure 24, the corresponding 
predictions for the maintenance phase are shown in Figure 23.

The safety E-R analysis of ALT and/or AST elevations showed that less than 4% of subjects experienced 
an elevation within the entire CC112273 exposure range (0.5 to 1 mg ozanimod QD) in the induction 
phase. Statistically significant predictors of ALT and/or AST elevations in the induction phase included 
- 
- 
- 
steady-state CC112273 exposure (higher hazard ratio for higher exposure) 
disease type (higher hazard ratio UC relative to RMS) 
sex (higher hazard ratio for males). 
The analysis of the maintenance phase, which included only UC subjects, also had a low incidence (<2%) 
of ALT and/or AST elevations for all CC112273 exposure levels. Statistically significant predictors of ALT 
and/or AST elevations in the maintenance phase included steady-state CC112273 exposure (hazard ratio 
= 5.44 at AUCss of 538 nM*hr relative to no exposure). The 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio 
for the effect of steady-state CC112273 exposure included 1, or no effect.  
Safety E-R of infections and infestations  
Similar to the safety endpoint of ALT/AST elevation time to event-analyses were used to figure out 
significant predictors for infections as a possible adverse event under ozanimod treatment. Analysis was 
split into induction phase and maintenance phase.  
The analysis of the induction phase showed, following the backward elimination process, that the 
remaining predictors were CC112273 AUCss, age, sex, baseline body weight, smoking status, and prior 
corticosteroid use. The impact of CC112273 AUCss was not statistically significant (p>0.10). The final 
model parameter estimates are presented in Table 26. 
The analysis of the maintenance phase, which included only UC subjects, showed an incidence of 
infections of 17.5% for all CC112273 exposure levels. Statistically significant predictors of infections in 
the maintenance phase included baseline body weight (hazard ratio = 0.77 at 51 kg and 1.48 at 108 kg 
relative to 73 kg), and baseline albumin level (hazard ratio = 1.43 at 36 g/L and 0.78 at 48 g/L relative 
to 43 g/L). Steady-state CC112273 exposure was not a statistically significant predictor and the 95% 
confidence interval for the hazard ratio included 1.0 (hazard ratio = 1.55 at AUCss of 409 nM*hr relative 
to no exposure). The incidence of infections and infestations increased with increasing exposure, but the 
trend of increasing incidence of infections and infestations with increasing CC112273 exposure was not 
significant. 
Hazard ratios for both models are listed in Table 27 and Table 28. VPC plots are shown in Figure 26 and 
Figure 27, the resulting predicted probability of an infection is depicted in Figure 28 and Figure 29.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical Pharmacodynamics 
Study RPC-1063-CP001 was conducted to evaluate the effect of cyclosporine, a probe drug for inhibition 
of BCRP on the plasma concentrations of ozanimod as well as its major active metabolites CC112273 and 
CC1084037, and revealed that the influence not only on the parent compound, but also on the main 
metabolites remain outside the range of potential clinical relevance. The proposed changes in the PI take 
adequately account of the results of the study. However, there is need for clarification on the adequacy of 
the information proposed for situations when other inhibitors (e.g. of CYP21C8) are administered 
concomitantly with inhibitors of BCRP. 
The applicant has further submitted an extension study of a previous PK study (RPC01-1001) which 
evaluated the pharmacodynamic response to ozanimod on different sets of leukocyte subpopulations. 
There was a clear differential effect on different peripheral leucocyte populations, and it could be shown 
that populations referring to the innate immune response (such as NK and NKT-cells) were not relevantly 
affected and section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated accordingly.  
In addition, the applicant has submitted Study RPC01-1915, an extension study to further evaluate the 
safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of ozanimod and active metabolites in healthy adult 
subjects further analysing the previous studies RPC01-1912, -1913, and -1914 in the context of the 
PK/PD documentation for the recovery from the peripheral leucocyte reduction. The study provided a 
good approximation of the recovery kinetics, which is thought to occur around 85 days post cessation of 
dosing. An amendment of the SmPC section 5.1 has been introduced to update the time to recovery of 
lymphocytes taking into account the variability observed. 
Ozanimod has been demonstrated to be clinically effective with a benefit risk profile administered as 1 mg 
once daily in patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. To evaluate the appropriateness of 1 
mg once daily in patients with UC, and to characterize the therapeutic window of ozanimod for patients 
with ulcerative colitis, an integrated PK assessment was made for ozanimod and the major metabolite 
CC112273, the PK/PD relationship with ALC reduction, dose-response and E-R relationships for efficacy, 
and E-R assessments for safety. 
The PK-PD analysis of ALC on study CLG-Certara-UC-358-2 showed a maximum saturable decrease from 
baseline ALC between 68% and 85%, and the CC112273 concentration required to achieve 50% of the 
maximal decrease between 1.3 and 3.8 nmol/L.  
A higher ALC baseline level was associated with a higher EC50. The Emax and EC50 parameters in the final 
model are correlated, which is not unexpected given the relatively narrow dose range for ozanimod (0.25 
mg to 2 mg) studied and large between subject variability in ALC response. 
ALC simulations based on post hoc estimates of UC patients with ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg daily were 
performed. The median times to recovery to 90% of baseline ALC after the patients stop the treatment 
were 52 and 67 days for ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg daily, respectively. The median change from 
baseline was -46.8% and -57.8% for ozanimod 0.5 mg and 1 mg daily, respectively. 
The dose dependence in recovery is consistent with the 0.5 mg having lower drug concentrations and ALC 
reduction than 1 mg, so recovery is more rapid. The mean simulated recovery of 32.8 days for 1 mg in 
UC is comparable to the 31.3 days in RMS, suggesting a similar recovery time across both disease states. 
The simulation results are comparable to the reported UC study results of approximately 35 days.

The evaluation of efficacy for ozanimod in the proposed indication is based on a pivotal Phase 3 study and 
a supportive Phase 2 study conducted in UC: Studies RPC01-3101 and RPC01-202. In this study, Fecal 
calprotectin, a biomarker of intestinal inflammation, was also measured. 
In patients with UC, treatment with ozanimod resulted in a decrease in the inflammatory marker, faecal 
calprotectin (FCP) during the induction period, which was then maintained throughout the maintenance 
period (at 10 and 52 weeks). 
A very thorough PK/PD analysis was performed regarding the Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC), with 
data also from the MS studies, however, in MS, ALC is the only PD biomarker available while in Ulcerative 
Colitis fecal calprotectin (FCP) is a much more common PD biomarker. Upon request from CHMP, the MAH 
conducted an exploratory analysis of the relationship between CC112273 exposure and FCP response in 
the Induction and Maintenance Periods of RPC01-3101 (CLG-Certara-UC-358-3). Although the results 
from the exploratory analysis of exposure-response between CC112273 and FCP were not quantitatively 
strong, qualitative results suggest a relation between ozanimod levels and FCP reduction. Additionally, 
although in the context of UC, ALC is a biomarker related to the mechanism of action, while fecal 
calprotectin (FCP) is a downstream biomarker of intestinal inflammation, efficacy results supersede the 
absence of a complete correlation of ozanimod and this PD biomarkers, therefore this issue was 
considered adequately addressed. 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics 
Two new Phase 1 studies were submitted. Study RPC01-1915, a Phase 1 extension study was conducted 
to provide data to further characterize the elimination kinetics of CC112273, and recovery kinetics of ALC 
in healthy subjects. Study RPC-1063-CP-001 was conducted to assess the impact of cyclosporine, a 
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor, on the PK of the major active metabolites, CC112273 
and CC1084037. This study provided additional data to supplement the results from Study RPC01-1903 
and demonstrated that cyclosporine did not impact the PK of the major circulating metabolites CC112273 
and CC1084037. 
The population pharmacokinetics of ozanimod and CC112273 were previously characterized to support 
the original RRMS application. With the addition of data from the UC program, these population models 
were updated to incorporate the new data, and covariate assessments were revised and expanded. 
CC112273 PK parameters are predictive of the interconverting metabolite CC1084037 and CC112273 
makes up the predominant circulating moiety. Additionally, CC1084037 and CC112273 time-matched 
concentrations were found to be highly correlated in a large dataset including Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies 
(correlation coefficient: 0.97). Therefore, PopPK analyses focused on quantifying concentrations of 
ozanimod and CC112273. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with changes in CC112273 PK would 
be anticipated to apply similarly to the interconverting metabolite CC1084037. 
Metabolite CC112273 Population pharmacokinetics were described with a 2-compartment disposition 
model and linear elimination. The rate of formation of the active metabolite was characterized using an 
absorption rate and fixed lag time describing the rate of appearance of CC112273 in the central 
compartment following dosed ozanimod in the drug depot, and relative bioavailability capturing the 
relative extent of metabolite formation. The most impactful covariates included a 108% increase in CL/F 
in smokers, and patients in the 95th percentile of body weight having a 179% increase in VC/F and 144% 
increase in KA. 
The final CC112273 PopPK model also included statistically significant covariate effects of body weight, 
age, bilirubin, sex, race, disease type, and hepatic impairment on CL/F; sex and hepatic impairment for 
VC/F; and sex, hepatic impairment, and disease type for KA. Results indicate no clinically meaningful 
difference in the PK in elderly patients, and that no dose adjustments are needed in patients over 65 
years.

Ozanimod population pharmacokinetics were described with a 2-compartment disposition model, a mixed 
zero-order and first order absorption rate, and linear elimination. The most impactful covariates on PK 
parameters were an increase in apparent clearance (CL/F) up to 23% for the 95th percentile of body 
weight, a 63.6% reduction in apparent central volume of distribution (VC/F) in RMS versus UC patients. 
The final ozanimod PopPK model included covariate effects of body weight, age, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), bilirubin and disease type on CL/F, disease type on VC/F, and body weight, sex, 
and disease type on first-order absorption rate constant (KA). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology has been sufficiently characterised in patients with UC.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Studies RPC01-202 and RPC01-3101 were designed to evaluate the treatment effect of ozanimod in patients 
with  moderate  to  severe  UC  using  different  but  complementary  study  designs  (treat  through  versus 
randomized  withdrawal).  Both  studies  included  an  Induction  Period  and  a  Maintenance  Period,  with  the 
objective to demonstrate efficacy at the end of each period. 
According to the MAH, due to the study design features unique to each of these randomized, controlled 
studies,  no  formal  data  integration  of  efficacy  results  was  performed,  and  results  from  the  studies  are 
presented individually. 
The MAH assumed the term “statistically significant” refers to p-values ≤ 0.05 for treatment comparisons 
that were subject to hierarchical testing schemes predefined in the SAPs, which controlled for type I error 
at the 5% level of significance. The term “nominally significant” refers to p-values ≤ 0.05 for treatment 
comparisons that do not control for type I error at the 5% level of significance, either because the treatment 
comparison was not included in the hierarchy or because the treatment comparison was a post hoc analysis. 
To enhance clarity in this regard, statistically significant p-values are designated in tables using boldface 
type and nominally significant p-values are designated using italicized type. 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies were included for the development of ozanimod for UC. Study RPC01-202 used 
two doses in the induction period (0.5mg and 1mg vs placebo for 9 weeks) and supports the use of the 
0.92mg (1mg/dose) 
2.4.1.1.  Study RPC01-02 – main study 
Methods 
Study RPC01-202 was a Phase 2, multi-center, parallel-group randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ozanimod versus placebo in adults aged 18 to 75 
years with moderately to severely active UC at screening, defined as a Mayo score of 6 to 12 inclusive 
with an endoscopy subscore of ≥ 2. 
Study design: 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens QD: placebo, 
ozanimod 0.5 mg, or ozanimod 1 mg. The Induction Period was 9 weeks, consisting of dose escalation 
over 7 days, followed by the assigned dose for 8 weeks. While the Study RPC01-3101 protocol included 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 73/209 
 
 
 
 
the 7-day dose escalation in the determination of the length of the Induction and Maintenance Periods 
(see below), the Study RPC01-202 protocol did not. Therefore, the end of the Induction Period in Study 
RPC01-202 has been renamed Week 9 and the end of the Maintenance Period has been re-named Week 
33 (termed Week 8 and Week 32, respectively, in the Study RPC01-202 clinical study report [CSR]) in 
order to ensure consistency between the studies in this SCE. 
The overall study design is shown in the following figure: 
Figure 30: RPC01-202 Study Design Schematic 
Subjects who completed the Induction Period and were responders at Week 9 (based on the 4- 
component Mayo definition) entered the 24-week Maintenance Period in which they continued to receive 
the same study treatment as during the Induction Period. Individual subject treatment remained blinded 
until all subjects reached the end of the Maintenance Period (Week 33). Subjects who completed the 
Induction Period and were non-responders at Week 9, and those who completed the Maintenance Period, 
and those who experienced disease relapse) during the Maintenance Period were eligible to enter the OLP 
Study participants 
To be enrolled, patients had to be receiving treatment with oral aminosalicylates or prednisone. Prior, but 
not concomitant, anti-TNF therapy was allowed, and randomization was stratified according to prior anti-
TNF therapy experience (yes or no). Subjects with severe extensive colitis, a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease 
or indeterminate colitis or the presence or history of a fistula consistent with Crohn’s disease, or positive 
stool culture for pathogens were excluded. 
Subjects who were receiving oral 5-ASA or oral corticosteroids at Screening were to keep their prescribed 
dose steady through the Induction Period. 
All subjects in the OLP received daily study treatment with ozanimod 1 mg. All subjects, including those 
subjects who had received ozanimod 1 mg treatment in the Induction Period or Maintenance Period, 
underwent the dose escalation regimen to ensure blinding and to mitigate potential side effects of 
ozanimod when initiating treatment. 
Subjects who did not show clinical improvement 8 weeks after initiation of the RPC01-202 OLP were to 
discontinue from the study. After completing 1 year of the OLP of Study RPC01-202, eligible subjects 
were able to immediately transition into the Phase 3 OLE Study RPC01-3102. The Sponsor stopped Study 
RPC01-202 in August 2019 in order to consolidate clinical studies; subjects had the opportunity to 
transition to the OLE Study RPC01- 3102 to continue treatment with investigational product.

Study Objectives: 
The primary objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of RPC1063 vs. placebo for induction of 
clinical remission at Week 8 in patients with moderately to severely active UC. The Secondary Study 
Objectives were to: 
•  Compare the efficacy of RPC1063 vs. placebo at Weeks 8 and 32 as measured by clinical 
response, clinical remission, and mucosal healing 
•  Compare the overall safety and tolerability of RPC1063 vs. placebo for the duration of the trial 
Outcomes/ endpoints: 
The following endpoints were used for the evaluation of efficacy in this study 
Induction Period 
• 
Primary endpoint (Week 9): Clinical remission (4-component Mayo) 
•  Key secondary endpoints (Week 9): Clinical response (4-component Mayo), Change from Baseline 
in Mayo score, Endoscopic improvement. 
• 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints (Week 9): Clinical response, remission, or endoscopic improvement 
in subjects who previously received anti-TNF therapy or were refractory, lost response to, or 
intolerant of anti-TNF therapy, Histologic remission 
Maintenance Period 
No hierarchy of endpoints was introduced for the following:  
- 
- 
- 
Clinical remission (4-component Mayo) 
Clinical response (4-component Mayo) 
Endoscopic improvement 
In Study RPC01-202, endoscopic improvement was defined as an endoscopy subscore ≤ 1 (normal or 
inactive disease, or mild disease [erythema, decreased vascular pattern, mild friability]), and was termed 
“mucosal healing” in the RPC01-202 CSR. Since the definition (endoscopy subscore of ≤ 1 point) is the 
same as the definition for “endoscopic improvement” in Study RPC01-3101, “endoscopic improvement” 
is used throughout this SCE for consistency. 
For the symptom scoring in this study, both RBS and SFS for a subject had to be available on the same 
day. The final scoring algorithm was using the last 14 days before the evaluation time-point. RBS and SFS 
were obtained from the subjects’ paper diary entries (Mayo Diary Card). Sites then calculated RBS and 
SFS using the Mayo Score Worksheet. Endoscopy subscore was provided by a blinded central reader. 
An interactive voice response system (IVRS) was used to stratify patients by prior anti-TNF treatment 
(yes or no) and to provide the treatment assignment for each patient. The randomisation scheme has 
been provided by the applicant in an appendix to the study report. 
Blinding 
During trial conduct through the time of data lock for the Induction Period, the Sponsor, patients, 
Investigators, and site personnel were blinded to treatment assignment. Placebo and active medication 
were of similar appearance.

Statistical methods 
To control for Type 1 error due to multiple endpoints and two comparisons within each endpoint, a closed, 
sequential hierarchical procedure for testing endpoint and contrasts was specified in the SAP that ranked 
the 1 mg vs. placebo comparison above the 0.5 mg vs. placebo comparison within each of the primary 
and key secondary endpoints. As such, the hierarchy was specified in the following order of tests: 
1. Proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 8: 1 mg dose vs. placebo 
2. Proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose vs. placebo 
3. Proportion of patients in clinical response at Week 8: 1 mg dose vs. placebo 
4. Proportion of patients in clinical response at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose vs. placebo 
5. Change in Mayo score from baseline at Week 8: 1 mg dose vs. placebo 
6. Change in Mayo score from baseline at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose vs. placebo 
7. Proportion of patients with mucosal healing at Week 8: 1 mg dose vs. placebo 
8. Proportion of patients with mucosal healing at Week 8: 0.5 mg dose vs. placebo 
Each of the above endpoint/comparison combinations was tested in order following this hierarchy. If a 
test did not result in a p-value that was <0.05, then all subsequent tests in the hierarchy were to be 
considered exploratory and their resulting p-values were to be considered nominal. 
In general, patients who were missing measures for response variables were analysed as non-responders 
for the primary analysis and patients who were missing measures for continuous variables had their last 
post-baseline value of the endpoint carried forward. If no post-baseline observation was available to carry 
forward, then the average score for the observed values within the same treatment group were used, 
rounded to the nearest integer. 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
The Safety Population included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, with 
treatment assignment based on the dose of RPC1063 actually received. 
Two analysis populations were used for efficacy analyses: 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of study treatment, with treatment assignment designated according to randomized treatment. This was 
the primary population for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of the subset of the ITT population who did not have a major 
protocol violation and had treatment compliance for RPC1063/placebo within 80% to 120%. Supportive 
efficacy analyses were performed using the PP population. 
Analysis of all efficacy endpoints were primarily based on the ITT population with treatment failure rules 
applied. The primary endpoint of proportion of patients in clinical remission at Week 8 was analysed using 
the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by prior anti-TNF therapy experience (yes or no). The 
primary analysis used the data from the 1 mg dose and placebo groups and compared the remission rates 
in these two groups using a two-sided test at the 0.05 level of significance. 
The sample size was justified with respect to the comparison of remission rates at the end of the 
Induction Period between an RPC1063 group and the placebo group. Based on the use of a two-sided test 
at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, and assuming a placebo remission rate of 10%, a sample size of 
60 patients per group will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in the remission rate of 21 
percentage points or larger (i.e., an active group remission rate of 31% or larger).

Results  
Participants flow 
A total of 199 subjects were enrolled in the study, including 67 subjects randomized to ozanimod 1 mg, 
66 to ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 66 to placebo (Table 35). Of the 199 randomized subjects, 197 (99.0%) 
received investigational product and were included in the ITT Population. Overall, 186 (93.5%) of the 
randomized subjects completed the induction period, with similar completion rates across treatment 
groups (ozanimod 1 mg: 94.0%; ozanimod 0.5 mg: 95.5%; placebo: 90.9%). The reasons for 
discontinuation from the induction period were investigator decision (3.0% placebo), AE (3.0% ozanimod 
0.5 mg, 1.5% placebo), consent withdrawal (4.5% ozanimod 1 mg, 1.5% placebo), subject choice to 
discontinue dosing (1.5% ozanimod 1 mg), and lack of efficacy (1.5% placebo). 
Study conduct 
The study was conducted in Europe (as well as in North America (USA and Canada) Asia (Korea, Israel) 
and Australia (Australia and New Zealand). The study has been conducted between 26 December 2012 
and 10 March 2015 at 57 different sites. 
Number analysed 
The subject disposition for the short-term treatment period is shown in the following table: 
Table 29: Subject Disposition in the Induction Period (All Randomized Subjects) – Study 
RPC01-202 
Approximately half (51.8%) of the randomized subjects entered the Maintenance Period, including, 
62.7% with ozanimod 1 mg, 54.5%with ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 37.9% with placebo. Of those subjects 
who entered the Maintenance Period, completion rates were 95.2%, 83.3%, 84.0%, respectively. The 
most common reasons for discontinuation from the Maintenance Period were lack of efficacy/worsening of 
UC (2.4% with ozanimod 1 mg, 11.1% with ozanimod 0.5 mg, and 4.0% with placebo) and

Table 30: Subject Disposition in the Maintenance Period (Randomized Subjects) – Study 
RPC01-202 
Of the 199 subjects who were randomized and entered the Induction Period in Study RPC01- 202, 170 
entered in the OLP. Of these, the majority of subjects (72.4%) completed the Week 56 visit and the Week 
104 visit (60.0%). Half (49.4%) of the subjects completed the Week 152 visit and 41.8% completed the 
Week 200 visit. Approximately 60% of subjects discontinued from the OLP. The most frequently reported 
reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, lack of efficacy, and subject choice to discontinue 
dosing (15.3% each). Three additional subjects did not have a study completion or discontinuation record 
(1 subject withdrew from the study due to a serious adverse event of erysipelas and 2 subjects withdrew 
consent). The Sponsor terminated the study in August 2019 in order to consolidate clinical studies. 
Baseline characteristics  
Demographic of subjects in Study RPC01-202 were generally similar across treatment groups. The overall 
ITT Population was 58.4% male and 92.4% white with mean age at Baseline of 40.8 years. The ozanimod 
1 mg treatment group had a greater proportion of males (71.6%) than the placebo treatment group 
(53.8%). Results are shown in the following table:

The baseline UC disease history of subjects in Study RPC01-202 was consistent across treatment groups. 
The mean duration of time since UC diagnosis 6.2 years. The median 4- component Mayo score at 
Baseline was 8, and approximately half of the subjects had a 4- component Mayo score > 8. All, but 2 
subjects, who were randomized in error, had Mayo endoscopy scores of 2 or 3. The evaluation is shown in

Prior and concomitant UC medications were generally similar across treatment groups. In the overall ITT 
Population, nearly all subjects had previously been treated with 5-ASA (98.0%) and 82.2% of subjects 
continued using 5-ASA at Screening. Approximately 78% of subjects had been previously treated with 
corticosteroids, and ~35% of subjects continued using systemic corticosteroids at Screening. Only about 
20% of the patients were previously using anti-TNF medication.

Outcomes and estimation 
The key efficacy results for the induction as well as “maintenance” period of the study are shown in the 
following table:

responder Imputation) – Study RPC01-202 
Similar remission rates and statistical significance were found for the ITT Population using observed cases 
or LOCF imputation and for the Per-Protocol Population. 
The primary analysis used Mayo scores with endoscopy sub-scores from central endoscopy reading, with 
adjudication if needed. As sensitivity analyses, other endoscopy reading methods were examined. Using 
the endoscopy sub-score from the original (single) central endoscopy reading (prior to adjudication) the 
results were similar to the primary analysis with the proportion of patients in clinical remission

statistically significantly higher for RPC1063 1 mg (17.9%) compared with placebo (4.6%, p=0.0114) but 
not for RPC1063 0.5 mg compared with placebo (13.8%, p=0.0698). Using the endoscopy subscore from 
Investigator’s reading (i.e., local reading), clinical remission rates were higher in both RPC1063 groups 
(0.5 mg 18.5%; 1 mg 17.9%) compared with placebo (7.7%) but the differences did not reach statistical 
significance (p=0.0702 and p=0.0600, respectively). 
The applicant has also evaluated the PD marker “reduction of lymphocyte count” and the following results 
were achieved: 
Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) was decreased in both RPC1063 treatment groups at all post-baseline 
visits. The steepest decrease occurred from baseline to Week 4. The following mean (SD) ALC values and 
percentage changes from baseline were observed at the end of the Induction Period (Week 8) and 
Maintenance Period (Week 32), respectively: 
• 
Placebo group: Week 8 (n=61) and Week 32 (n=20): 
- 
1.93 (0.74) and 2.04 (0.84) cells x 109/L reflecting a change from baseline +16.6 (106.0)% and 
+4.8 (30.5)% 
The mean percentage increase in the placebo group is influenced by one patient with 800% increase in 
ALC from baseline to Week 4 and Week 8. Median changes at these timepoints were +9% and +3%, 
respectively. 
•  RPC1063 0.5 mg group: Week 8 (n=61) and Week 32 (n=29): 
- 
1.19 (0.53) and 1.12 (0.54) cells x 109/L reflecting a change from baseline -32.3 (30.5)% and -
32.3 (50.7)%

2.4.1.2.  Long-term extension phase of study RPC01-202 
The open-label period of the study was reported with a separate study report and only relevant results 
are summarised here. 
Study participants 
Subjects who completed the Induction Period and were non-responders at Induction Period Week 8 and 
those that completed the Maintenance Period or experienced disease relapse during the Maintenance 
Period had the option to enter the OLP. All subjects in the OLP (placebo group, ozanimod 0.5 mg group, 
and ozanimod 1 mg group from Core Period) received daily study treatment with ozanimod 1 mg. There 
was an 8-day dose escalation regimen consisting of 4 days of treatment with ozanimod 0.25 mg, followed 
by 3 days of treatment with ozanimod0.5 mg, followed by ozanimod 1 mg. All subjects, including those 
subjects who received ozanimod 1 mg treatment in the Induction Period or Maintenance Period, 
underwent the dose escalation regimen to ensure blinding. Subjects who did not show clinical 
improvement 8 weeks after initiation of the OLP were to discontinue from the study. The Sponsor stopped 
Study RPC01-202 in August 2019 and subjects had the opportunity to transition to the open-label 
extension Study RPC01-3102 to continue treatment with study drug. 
Efficacy measurements 
The efficacy measurements were summarized by Core Period treatment group at each OLP visit in the ITT 
population. The efficacy analyses are also presented by Responder (R) and non-responder (NR), which 
are defined by clinical response and reflect response status at OLP Baseline (i.e., last response status 
measured prior to first dose of ozanimod in OLP). Non responder imputation (NRI) was used as the 
primary method for addressing missing binary outcomes.

Number analysed 
A total of 170 subjects were enrolled in the OLP. Of the 170 subjects who entered the OLP, the majority 
of subjects (123 subjects [72.4%]) completed the Week 56 visit and the Week 104 visit (102 subjects 
[60.0%]). There were 84 subjects (49.4%) who completed the Week 152 visit and 71 subjects (41.8%) 
who completed the Week 200 visit. There were 99 subjects (58.2%) who discontinued from the OLP. 
Reported primary reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent, lack of efficacy, and subject 
choice to discontinue dosing (26 subjects each, 15.3%). There were 3 subjects who did not have a study 
completion or discontinuation record. Of these 3 subjects, 1 subject (Subject 202-412- 2002) withdrew 
from the study due to an SAE of erysipelas and 2 subjects withdrew consent. 
The following table shows the subject disposition at enrolment:

Baseline characteristics 
Demographic characteristics for subjects who entered the OLP were assessed at the Core Period baseline. 
For subjects who entered the OLP, the mean age at Core Period baseline was 40.4 years, the mean 
weight was 74.2 kg, and the majority of subjects (157 subjects [92.4%)]) were White. The demographic 
characteristics for subjects who entered the OLP were similar to the overall population enrolled in the 
Core Period (data not shown). 
Ulcerative colitis disease history for subjects who entered the OLP was assessed at the Core Period 
baseline. There were no notable differences in baseline disease characteristics across Core Period 
treatment groups for subjects in the ITT Population who entered the OLP. 
Results 
Outcome and estmation 
The observed cases of clinical remission (based on the four-component, the three-component, or partial 
Mayo) at Week 56 and Week 104 (regardless of core study treatment assignment and status of remission 
at the end of core study) are presented in the following table. Overall, 39.5% of subjects were in clinical 
remission (four-component Mayo) starting from Week 56 and 41.4% of subjects were in clinical remission 
at Week 104. Using NRI, 54.7% of subjects were in clinical remission (partial Mayo) starting from Week 
56 and 45.9% of subjects were in clinical remission at Week 104.

complete Mayo score was maintained over the OLP.

OLP – Observed Cases (ITT Population) 
Because the schedule of endoscopies performed beyond Week 104 was variable the number of 
endoscopies performed at later timepoints was small, which limits interpretation of results. Approximately 
50% of subjects who had an endoscopy at Weeks 56 and 104 had endoscopic improvement (endoscopy 
subscore of ≤ 1 point) and approximately 37% and 30% of subjects had mucosal healing (alternative 
definition; endoscopy subscore of ≤ 1 point and a Geboes score < 2.0) at Weeks 56 and 104, respectively. 
Overall, approximately half of subjects were in histologic remission starting from Week 56 and throughout 
the OLP. The results are shown in the following table:

2.4.1.3.  Dose-response report (Study RPC01-202 efficacy results and dose estimation for 
clinical response at week 32) 
A report was provided to estimate the dose of ozanimod for assessing long term efficacy in subjects with 
moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Dose estimation was conducted through modeling and simulation 
results based on a post-hoc analysis using clinical response at Week 32 utilizing the 3-component Mayo 
score from study RPC01-202. This endpoint was selected since there were enough events to allow for 
reliable model estimation in making distributional assumptions for conducting simulations when 
estimating dose. Another important assumption is that after 32-weeks clinical response should be stable 
and representative of the week 52 assessment planned for Study RPC01-3101. 
A logistic regression model with treatment and prior TNF exposure as covariates was applied to the 
clinical response data at week 32. After initially fitting this model to that data, estimates and their 
standard errors for each treatment group were obtained on the logit scale using PROC GENMOD with the 
LS MEANS option in SAS. Since the estimators for each of the treatment groups on the logit scale have 
the property of being distributed as a normal with mean 
 and variance 
 2 for i=1 (placebo), 2 
(ozanimod 0.5 mg), and 3 (ozanimod 1.0 mg), data can be simulated under these distributional 
𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇
𝜎𝜎𝜇𝜇
assumptions and a simple linear regression model with dose as a dependent variable (0 if placebo, 0.5 if 
ozanimod mg, and 1 if ozanimod 1 mg) can be fitted for each simulated case. Moreover, this will provide 
a distribution for dose using inverse prediction as the linear regression is a 1-to-1 function. Hence, if the 
desired response of some function f(x) is known where x is dose, then we can find the dose that maps 
back into that function via f-1(x). The targeted probability response is an absolute increase in clinical 
response of 0.30 above the placebo response which was estimated to be 0.128. 
A linear regression was fitted to each simulation set such that 10,000 intercepts, slopes, and targeted 
doses through inverse prediction were created to construct their respective empirical distributions. 
In the simulations, the targeted dose on average was 0.96 mg with a 95% empirical confidence interval 
of [0.70 mg, 1.42 mg].

2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
2.4.1.1.  Study RPC01-3101 
RPC01-3101: “A phase 3, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral 
RPC1063 as induction and maintenance therapy for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis” 
Methods 
The study consisted of two periods, and two cohorts in the first period: 
In the Induction Period, subjects in Cohort 1 were randomized 2:1 to ozanimod 1 mg (N = 429) or 
placebo (N = 216) and subjects in Cohort 2 received open-label ozanimod 1 mg (N = 367). Subjects 
treated with ozanimod 1 mg who completed the Induction Period and who had achieved clinical response 
at Week 10 were eligible to be randomized 1:1 to receive either ozanimod 1 mg (N = 230) or matching 
placebo (N = 227) for an additional 42 weeks in the Maintenance Period. Subjects who were treated with 
placebo (Cohort 1) and who showed a clinical response at Week 10 continued to receive placebo in the 
Maintenance Period (N = 69). Total treatment duration in Study RPC01-3101 (including both the 
Induction and Maintenance Periods) was 52 weeks. Upon completion of 52 weeks of treatment, subjects 
were eligible to continue in OLE Study RPC01-3102 (up to a total treatment period of 5 years).

Study participants 
The following most relevant in- and exclusion criteria were defining the patient population for the 
induction phase: 
- 
Age range between 18 and 75 (at screening) 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 89/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
UC diagnosed at least 3 months before first intake of the investigational drug with confirmation of 
the diagnosis by clinical, endoscopic and histolopathological evidence (histology and/or endoscopy could 
be performed at screening also.

Must be currently receiving treatment with at least one of the following medications: oral 
aminosalicylates (dose of 2.4 g or higher) with at least stable dose for 3 weeks prior to screening, 
prednisone at doses similar or smaller to 20 mg/day (or equivalent) at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks 
prior to screening or budesonide Multi Matrix (MMX) therapy receiving a stable dose for at least 2 weeks 
prior to screening endoscopy. 
- 
Could have received corticosteroids at doses ≥ 30 mg or budesonide MMX ≥ 9 mg or intravenous 
corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks and/or aminosalicylates at a dose of at least 2.4 g for 8 weeks and 
have failed treatment or have inadequate response. 
- 
Could have received biologics/anti TNF therapy prior to screening with an at least 8 week (or 5 
elimination half-live) time distance and have inadequate response to this treatment after at least 4 weeks 
of treatment (either as primary non-response, or secondary non-response, or as intolerance to this 
treatment). Biologics were not allowed during treatment. Patients with an inadequate response or failure 
with more than 2 biologics were excluded as were those with a primary non-response to two or more 
biologics. Primary nonresponse was defined as signs and symptoms of persistently active disease despite 
an adequate trial of induction treatment with an anti-TNF agent (per country's approved label) 
- 
Could have received “conventional” immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, 
methotrexate) but have failed or inadequate response after an at least 8 week treatment (doses of AZA ≥ 
1.5 mg/kg or 6-MP ≥ 0.75 mg/kg or MTX ≥ 12.5 mg/week), or intolerance. Immunosuppressant were not 
allowed during treatment. 
- 
Patients having previously received D-penicillamine, leflunomide, or thalidomide, natalizumab, 
fingolimod or etrasimod were excluded. 
- 
- 
Availability of historical endoscopy (e.g. for cancer surveillance), highly active contraception. 
Patients with severe extensive colitis, a history of fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon or imminent 
colectomy were also excluded. 
- 
Further exclusion criteria comprised a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, the presence of positive 
testing for C. difficile and other pathogens (ova, parasites, bacteria) within the last 60 days, and the 
presence of clinically relevant concomitant hepatic, neurological, pulmonary, phythamological, endocrine, 
psychiatric, and cardiovascular conditions making implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the 
study difficult or that would put the subject at risk by participating in the study, presence of type I 
diabetes, or any uncontrolled diabetes, history of uveitis, presence of any clinically relevant infection 
(Tbc, Hepatitis) 
For the inclusion into the maintenance period, patients would need to have a “clinical response” either 
based on the total Mayo Score, or the three component Mayo Score (excluding physician’s judgement). 
Subjects rerandomized in the Maintenance Period were stratified prior to randomization by clinical 
remission status (by either 3-component or 4-component Mayo Score) at Week 10 (yes or no) and 
corticosteroid use at Week 10 (yes or no). Clinical response (also used as endpoint in the induction 
period) for the inclusion into this phase) was defined as follows:

Four-component Mayo: A reduction from Baseline in the Complete Mayo score of ≥ 3 points and ≥ 30%, 
and a reduction from Baseline in the Rectal Bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or an absolute Rectal Bleeding 
subscore of ≤ 1 point. 
Three-component Mayo: A reduction from Baseline in the 9-point Mayo score of ≥ 2 points and ≥ 35%, 
and a reduction from Baseline in the Rectal Bleeding subscore of ≥ 1 point or an absolute Rectal Bleeding 
subscore of ≤ 1 point 
As mentioned, the study was conducted on all continents with most centers located at academic (tertiary 
care) specialised gastroenterology of IBD centers, but also at secondary care ambulatory (private 
practice) centres. No primary care centres were involved. 
Treatments 
Cohort 1: On Induction Day 1, subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to initiate investigational 
drug in accordance with a 7-day dose escalation regimen starting with: 
- On Days 1 to 4, ozanimod 0.25 mg or matching placebo once daily (one 0.25 mg capsule) 
- On Days 5 to 7, ozanimod 0.5 mg or matching placebo once daily (two 0.25 mg capsules) 
- On Day 8, subjects received ozanimod 1 mg or matching placebo once daily for 9 weeks (one 1 mg 
capsule) 
Cohort 2: On Induction Day 1, all subjects initiated investigational drug in accordance with a 7-day dose 
escalation regimen starting with the similar schedule as mentioned above with active treatment only. 
On Maintenance Day 1, subjects from Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 with clinical response to ozanimod during the 
Induction Period were randomly assigned 1:1 to: 
- Ozanimod 1 mg once daily for 42 weeks (one 1 mg capsule), or 
- Matching placebo; a single capsule once daily for 42 weeks  
Subjects from Cohort 1 who had been randomized to receive placebo and showed a clinical response at 
Week 10 continued to receive placebo in the Maintenance Period in a double-blind manner. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of ozanimod versus placebo on 
induction of clinical remission in adults (for the induction therapy period), and to demonstrate the efficacy 
of ozanimod versus placebo on the maintenance therapy. These were defined as separate objectives. 
The secondary objectives in the induction phase were as follows: 
- 
-

The following “treatment failure rules were set up: 
Subjects were considered to have failed treatment if any of the following occurred: 
-  Any protocol-prohibited change in medications including: 
o 
o 
 Post-Baseline initiation of, or increase in total daily dose level higher than the maximum 
dose taken between the Screening and Baseline visits in: 
  Corticosteroids or 5-ASA dose to treat UC 
 
Prolonged course of systemic corticosteroids > 14 days for treatment of disease 
other than UC 
Initiation of an immune suppressing therapy including 6-MP, azathioprine, anti- TNF 
agents, vedolizumab or tofacitinib 
 A colectomy (partial or total) or an ostomy 
 Discontinuation of investigational drug for lack of therapeutic effect before the Week 10 or Week 
52 efficacy evaluations- 
- 
- 
Subjects meeting criteria for treatment failure were treated as non-responders using NRI for statistical 
analyses of efficacy. 
For the endoscopies, in order to ensure quality data and standardization, the same endoscopist was used 
throughout the study wherever possible. Endoscopy videos were obtained during each endoscopy and 
were sent for central reading and determination of the Mayo endoscopy subscore. A detailed video review 
charter from the central reading laboratory outlined the endoscopic procedures, video recordings and 
equipment. 
A clear biopsy protocol was implemented for the evaluation of the presence of disease as well as disease 
activity with taking one biopsy pair to be taken from the most inflamed area of the left colon. 
For the subjective parts of the Mayo score, (stool frequency and rectal bleeding components of the Mayo 
score) and the clinician-reported Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) were collected in an electronic 
diary. Subjects completed the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores daily from the first screening 
visit for the subject throughout the study, except for the 90-day Safety Follow-up Visit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 95/209 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were instructed on the use and completion of questions on the electronic diary. The subjects’ 
normal number of stools was recorded on the first day of screening. This was defined as the number of 
stools the subject passed in a 24-hour period prior to having UC or when the subject was in remission. 
The diary entries were reviewed by site personnel during screening (prior to dosing, if applicable) and 
during all study visits, except for the 90-day Safety Follow-up Visit. The stool frequency and rectal 
bleeding diary entries 2-weeks prior to each study visit were used to calculate the 3-component, 4-
component, and partial Mayo score. 
For the evaluation of the RBS and SFS items, different scoring algorithms were used: 
Both RBS and SFS for a subject had to be available on the same day. Two different scoring algorithms (A 
and B) with 2 different timeframes (7-day or 14-day) were used. The stool frequency and rectal bleeding 
diary entries within the 7-day period prior to each study visit were used to calculate RBS and SFS used 
for the primary analyses (7-day scoring algorithm A).  
While per the RPC01-3101 Induction Period statistical analysis plan (SAP) version (v)1.0, it was originally 
planned to use the same 14-day scoring algorithm for the primary analysis as was used for Study RPC01-
202, the algorithm was changed to the 7-day algorithm in the RPC01-3101 Induction Period SAP v4.0 
based on health authority feedback (FDA response letter [dated 15 Jun 2019]).  
In order to show similarity in derivation of clinical remission and clinical response despite differences in 
the 2 scoring algorithms, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using the 14-day scoring algorithm A. An 
additional sensitivity analysis using the 14-day scoring algorithm B was also conducted. Algorithm B 
required at least 2 consecuteive days in which bltoh RBS and SFS assessments were made on the same 
day within the 14-day time-frame, while for algorithm A, days did not have to be consecutive.  The 
algorithms and their use are shown in the following table: 
Table 40: Mayo scoring algorithm used in study RPC01-3101 
Note: A day was considered as an allowable day 
if it satisfied the following criteria:  
- has non-missing RBS and SFS data and is not 
excluded due to endoscopy procedure 
requirements. The determination of “3 allowable 
days” was to be in the following order: 
1. If there are 3 consecutive days with non-
missing stool frequency and rectal bleeding data, 
then use the 3 consecutive days closest to the 
visit date. 
2. If there are only 2 consecutive days with non-
missing stool frequency and rectal bleeding data, 
then use the 2 consecutive days closest to the 
visit date plus 1 day with non-missing stool 
frequency and rectal bleeding closest to the visit 
date. 
3. If there are 3 days with non-missing stool 
frequency and rectal bleeding data, but they are 
not consecutive, then use the 3 days closest to 
the visit date. 
If there are no 3 days with both non-missing 
stool frequency and rectal bleeding data, then 
the subscores will be set to missing. 
Because the colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy preparations can interfere with the assessment of other 
clinical parameters, diary entries used to calculate the 4-component Mayo Score and Partial Mayo Score 
did not correspond to day(s) of bowel preparation or endoscopy.

Sample size 
The protocol (latest version No. 7) included the following reflections about the sample size: 
Cohort 1 (adult patients): Based on results from a previous Phase 2 induction trial of RPC1063 1 mg, it is 
anticipated that at least 16% of patients in the RPC1063 group and approximately 6% of patients in the 
placebo group will be in clinical remission at the end of the IP. Based on a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at 
alpha = 0.05, a sample size of approximately 600 patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio in Cohort 1 (400 
RPC1063 1 mg and 200 placebo) will provide at least 90% power to detect this difference of 10 
percentage points. 
Cohort 2 (adult patients): Based on the same Phase 2 trial, it is anticipated that at least 60% of patients 
treated with RPC1063 will have a clinical response at the end of the IP. In order to ensure that there are 
approximately 420 patients with a clinical response to RPC1063 for potential enrolment of approximately 
400 patients into the MP (assuming a 5% dropout rate), it will be necessary to enrol approximately 900 
adult patients overall into the IP, of which 700 will receive treatment with RPC1063. Therefore, 
approximately an additional 300 patients receiving RPC1063 1 mg will be enrolled into Cohort 2. 
Maintenance period: The placebo remission rate at Week 42 (52 weeks total treatment) is assumed to be 
16% in a randomized withdrawal trial in UC patients who have previously had a clinical response to 
induction therapy (Feagan et al, 2013). Based on a 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at alpha = 0.05, a sample 
size of 400 patients (200 patients per treatment group) will provide 90% power to detect a statistically 
significant improvement in the remission rate of 14 percentage points or larger (i.e., an active group 
remission rate of 30% or higher). To account for a 5% rate of patients who had a clinical response to 
induction therapy with RPC1063 not entering the MP, approximately 420 patients with a clinical response 
to RPC1063 will be required at the end of the IP. 
The placebo remission rate at Week 42 (52 weeks total treatment) in the subset of patients who are in 
remission at Week 10 is assumed to be 16% (remission-in-remitters). Based on a 2-sided Fisher’s exact 
test at alpha = 0.05, a sample size of 120 patients (60 per treatment group) will provide approximately 
80% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in the remission-in-remitters rate of 24 
percentage points or larger (ie, an active group remission-in-remitter rate of 40% or higher). As Cohort 2 
is open-label, the ongoing remission rate at Week 10 from this cohort will be tracked and if it becomes 
evident that there will be fewer than 66 remitters from Cohort 2 entering MP, the sample size of Cohort 2 
will be increased in proportion to the number of remaining remitters necessary to achieve approximately 
66, which may in turn increase the number of patients from Cohort 2 qualifying to enter MP. To ensure 
adequate powering for the MP and a total of approximately 110 remitters, it may be necessary to increase 
the number of patients in Cohort 2 and therefore the total number of patients in the study. 
Of note is the fact that the protocol also included recruitment of a cohort 3 referring to adolescent 
patients (which was implemented into the protocol per amendment and at request of the FDA). The study 
did, however, finally not recruit any adolescents. Therefore, this aspect of the trial is not further reported 
(however: see protocol amendments). 
The final sample sizes were 429 and 216 in cohort 1 (treated with active and placebo, respectively) and 
367 in the cohort 2. The maintenance study included finally 227 and 230 patients in the active and 
placebo groups. 
Randomisation 
The protocol foresaw the following for randomisation: 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 97/209 
 
 
 
 
Consented/assented patients meeting all eligibility criteria will be assigned to treatment/randomized using 
the Interactive voice /web-based activated response system (IXRS). 
Randomisation for cohort 1 in the induction phase was done using a 2:1 ratio (active:placebo) and using 
a 1:1 ratio in the maintenance phase. Cohort 2 was, of course not randomised. 
Stratification factors were prior use of biologics/Anti-TNFs (yes/no) and use of corticosteroids (yes/no) for 
the induction period. 
For the maintenance phase, patients were stratified by clinical remission status at Week 10 (yes or no) 
and corticosteroids use at Week 10 (yes or no). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted double-blind in cohort 1 and for the maintenance phase. Neither the 
investigator nor the patients were aware of treatment assignment until the end of the study period (last 
patient out). 
Ozanimod and placebo capsules were identical in physical appearance. The treatment each subject 
received was not disclosed to the investigator, site staff, subject, Sponsor, or the clinical staff at the 
Contract Research Organization (CRO) involved with study conduct or data collection/analysis. Access to 
treatment assignments was strictly limited to groups directly involved with drug distribution, preparation 
of unblended output for the DSMB, safety personnel unblinded to treatment for SAE cases, and personnel 
involved in the conduct of PK assays. 
Statistical methods 
Data were analysed separately for the Induction Period and Maintenance Period according to their 
respective SAPs (SAP v4.0 for the Induction Period and SAP v4.1 for the Maintenance Period). Both 
periods were evaluated independently (regarded as independent studies). Changes to the planned 
statistical analyses plans were made prior to study unblinding. 
All subject populations were defined and documented prior to database lock. The following analysis 
populations were used in the statistical analysis: 
- 
- 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) populations: 
Induction Period ITT Population: (Cohort 1) All randomized subjects from Cohort 1 of the 
Induction Period of the study who received at least 1 dose of investigational drug (ozanimod or placebo); 
and (Cohort 2) all enrolled subjects from Cohort 2 of the Induction Period of the study who received at 
least 1 dose of investigational drug (ozanimod) 
- 
Maintenance Period ITT Population: All randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
investigational drug (ozanimod or placebo) in the Maintenance Period 
The ITT populations were used as the primary population for all efficacy parameters. 
- 
Per Protocol (PP) populations: The PP populations consists of all subjects in the ITT populations 
who adhered to the protocol. These populations were used in sensitivity analyses of the primary and key 
secondary endpoints to evaluate the influence of major protocol violators and protocol deviators on the 
primary results. Subjects were excluded from these populations if they violated the eligibility criteria or 
significantly deviated from the study plan. Specific reasons for warranting exclusion from these 
populations were documented prior to database lock and included, but were not limited to, investigational 
drug noncompliance > 20%, receiving incorrect investigational drug for more than 1 week in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 98/209 
 
 
 
 
Induction Period or more than 1 month in the Maintenance Period, and missing more than 2 visits while 
still on the study. 
- 
Safety populations: The Safety populations consist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
investigational drug. These populations were used for all summaries of safety data. Subjects randomized 
to placebo who received any amount of ozanimod were to be summarized in the ozanimod 1 mg group. 
Subjects randomized to ozanimod who received only placebo for all doses were to be summarized in the 
placebo group, otherwise they were to be summarized in the ozanimod 1 mg group. 
Statistical tests: 
• 
Induction period: 
The primary analysis of proportion of subjects in clinical remission (3-component Mayo definition, 7-day 
scoring algorithm) at Week 10 was carried out on the ITT population using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test at the 5% level of significance, stratified by corticosteroid use at screening (yes or 
no), and prior anti-TNF use (yes or no). Number of subjects in remission, remission percentages, 
weighted difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
and p-values are reported. Subjects who met the criteria for treatment failure were imputed using Non-
Responder Imputation (NRI)  
The primary analysis was repeated on the PP population and on key subgroups of the ITT population 
including, but not limited to, subjects with and without prior anti-TNF experience and subjects with and 
without prior corticosteroid use. These were considered sensitivity/supportive analyses only and are not 
subject to family-wise Type I error control. 
The alternative definitions of remission were evaluated as sensitivity analysis (not subject to type I error 
control). 
Starting from the primary endpoint, the 3 key secondary endpoints (clinical response, mucosal response 
and mucosal healing) were subsequently tested in order using a hierarchical testing procedure  in order to 
control the overall Type I error rate for multiple endpoints. If the primary endpoint was statistically 
significant, the proportion of subjects with a clinical response (3-component Mayo definition, 7-day 
scoring algorithm) at Week 10 was tested at the 5% level of significance. This testing procedure 
continued through each of the 3 key secondary endpoints until an endpoint failed to reach statistical 
significance. 
All secondary and other efficacy endpoints expressed as proportions of subjects were tested using the 
same type of CMH test as specified for the primary endpoint. All efficacy endpoints expressed as changes 
from Baseline were analysed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted for Baseline 
response parameter of interest, corticosteroid use at Screening, and prior anti-TNF use. The unadjusted 
mean changes from Baseline and SDs, adjusted least squares (LS) means and standard errors (SEs) with 
95% CIs for both mean changes from Baseline and difference in the mean changes from Baseline, and p-
values are provided. 
•  Maintenance Period: 
The primary analysis of proportion of subjects in clinical remission (3-component Mayo definition, 7-day 
scoring algorithm) at Week 52 was carried out on the Maintenance Period ITT population using a 2-sided 
CMH test at the 5% level of significance, stratified by clinical remission status at Week 10 (3- or 4-
component Mayo definition) of the Induction Period (yes or no), and corticosteroid use at Week 10 of the 
Induction Period (yes or no). Results were expressed as number of subjects in remission, remission 
percentages, weighted difference in remission percentages, odds ratio, and associated 95% CIs and p-
values. Subjects who met the criteria for treatment failure were imputed using NRI 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 99/209 
 
 
 
 
The primary analysis was repeated on the PP population and on key subgroups of the ITT population 
including, but not limited to, subjects with and without prior anti-TNF experience, subjects with and 
without prior corticosteroid use, and subjects with and without clinical remission at Week 10 of the 
Induction Period. These are considered sensitivity/supportive analyses only and are not subject to family-
wise Type I error control. 
In addition to the primary analysis of Maintenance Period clinical remission at Week 52 using the 3-
component Mayo definition, the following alternative definitions of remission were explored as sensitivity 
analyses: 
-  Alternative definition 1: Rectal Bleeding Subscore ≤ 1 point and Stool Frequency Subscore ≤ 0 
point (same or improved) and Endoscopy Subscore ≤ 1 point 
-  Alternative definition 2: Rectal Bleeding Subscore = 0 point and Stool Frequency Subscore ≤ 1 
point and Endoscopy Subscore ≤ 1 point 
-  Alternative definition 3: Partial Mayo Score of ≤ 2 points with none of the associated 3 subscores 
> 1 point 
-  Alternative definition 4: Geboes index score ≤ 1.1 ignoring Geboes 2A (eosinophil score) 
Stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores derived using two 14-day scoring algorithm  were also 
applied to the Mayo score calculation. Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint based on 14-day 
scoring algorithm was performed to support its primary analysis. 
The 6 key secondary endpoints were tested in order using a hierarchical testing procedure (as ordered in 
Section 8.2.1.4) in order to control the overall Type I error rate for multiple endpoints. If the primary 
endpoint was statistically significant, the proportion of subjects with a clinical response (3-component 
Mayo definition) at 52 weeks was tested at the 5% level of significance. 
If that endpoint was significant, then the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at 52 
weeks was tested at the 5% level of significance. This testing procedure continued through each of the 6 
key secondary endpoints until an endpoint failed to reach statistical significance, after which all 
subsequent key secondary endpoints were considered exploratory. Endpoints listed as other secondary 
endpoints were tested in a non-hierarchical fashion without adjustments for multiplicity.  
Handling of Missing Data 
For proportion-based primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, subjects with missing Week 10 
efficacy data for the Induction Period and/or subjects with missing Week 52 efficacy data for Maintenance 
Period were considered non-responders using non-responder imputation (NRI). Sensitivity analyses 
around missing data could include tipping-point analysis, missing data imputed using multiple imputation 
(MI) and analysing observed cases with no imputation. 
These missing data handling methods are detailed in the two SAPs. Conducting these sensitivity analyses 
using the proposed missing data handling methods (NRI, tipping point and multiple imputation) is to 
support that the comparisons of the 2 treatment groups in clinical remission at Week 10 and Week 52 are 
robust under different missing data imputation methods. For continuous efficacy endpoints, missing data 
analysis was performed using an MI method and observed cases with no imputation. 
For cohort 2, no inferential testing was carried out. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the endpoints of clinical remission and clinical response only using 
the three-component Mayo score based on a 7-day scoring algorithm. The following were the pre-defined 
subgroups for the Induction Period as well as for the maintenance period: 
1. Corticosteroid use at screening (yes vs no) 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 100/209 
 
 
 
 
2. Prior anti-TNF use (yes vs no) 
3. Baseline complete Mayo score (≤ 9 vs > 9) 
4. Extent of colitis (left-sided vs extensive) 
5. Sex (female vs male) 
6. Age at screening (≤ median vs > median) 
7. Baseline fecal calprotectin (≤ 250 vs > 250 mg/kg) 
8. Baseline ALC (≤ 1,500 vs > 1,500 10^6/L) 
9. Years since initial UC diagnosis (≤ 4 vs > 4 years) 
10. Region (North America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Asia Pacific) 
11. Baseline partial Mayo score (≤median vs > median) 
12. Baseline partial Mayo score (≤ 7 vs > 7) 
13. Baseline endoscopy subscore (2 vs 3) 
14. Moderate UC status at Baseline (4-component Mayo score 6 to 10; yes versus no) 
In addition, for the maintenance period, subgroup analyses were also performed for the criteria clinical 
remission status at week 10 (yes/no), and corticosteroids use at week 10 (yes/no). 
In the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, the applicant takes note of the fact that the planning of the study 
(and the plans for evaluation) were drawn up at the time before the finalisation of the ICH-E9 addendum 
as well as the UC guideline were published or came into force. The applicant explains that the proposed 
evaluation strategy would implicitly correspond to a composite analysis strategy. 
For treatment failure event number 1 (prohibited change in background medication), all potential 
treatment failure events were programmatically identified using a predefined search algorithm using WHO 
DD drug class and blinded data transfers. A manual review by the Sponsor team was conducted to 
confirm these potential treatment failures in a blinded manner prior to DBL. Based on the confirmed 
treatment failures, subjects had their efficacy data censored if collected on or after the date on which the 
treatment failure event took place and were considered non-remitters or non-responders for clinical 
remission or clinical response, respectively. 
For treatment failure event number 2 (colectomy of other UC surgery), events were observed prior to 
unblinding of Study RPC01-3101 and subjects with events were considered non-remitters or non-
responders for clinical remission or clinical response, respectively. 
For treatment failure event number 3 (discontinuation due to lack of effect), subjects were encouraged to 
stay in the study for safety purposes if they stopped study treatment due to lack of therapeutic effect 
during the Induction Period; however, collection of efficacy data was discouraged by the Sponsor. In the 
Maintenance Period, if subjects relapsed, they were offered an opportunity to enrol into the OLE Study 
RPC01-3102, in which future efficacy data would not be available for analysis. If a subject discontinued 
the study due to relapse, then no efficacy data would be available and this would fall under the handling 
of missing data, in which NRI would apply (i.e., all missing data would be non-remitter or non-responder 
for clinical remission or clinical response, respectively). 
Sensitivity estimand analyses that were outlined in the SCE SAP only included the treatment failure 
number 1 (except prolonged course of systemic corticosteroids > 14 days for treatment of disease other 
than UC) as intercurrent events (ICE) and did not involve treatment failures numbers 2 or 3.

Results 
Participant flow 
Of a total of 370 sites, 285 sites in 30 countries screened at least one subject for the trial. A total of 250 
sites enrolled subjects. A total of 1831 subjects were screened, of which 819 failed screening criteria. The 
most common reasons for screen failure were not meeting the total Mayo score requirements (6-12) or 
the RBS and SFS in 18.1%, the presence of Varizella antibodies (or vaccination within 30 days prior to 
randomisation) in 5.7%, and inability to provide written informed consent and be compliant with the 
schedule of assessments in 4.6%. 
There were 1012 subjects enrolled in Study RPC01-3101, including 645 subjects in Cohort 1 (429 
randomized to ozanimod 1 mg and 216 to placebo) and 367 subjects in Cohort 2 (all treated with 
ozanimod 1 mg).

A total of 526 subjects were treated during the Maintenance Period of the study, including 457 in the 
randomised part, of which 230 were re-randomized to ozanimod 1 mg, and 227 who re-randomized from 
ozanimod 1 mg to placebo, and 69 who continued on placebo. The numbers as well as discontinuations 
from the study with reasons are given in the following table. 
The completion rate for the Maintenance Period was 80% in subjects continuously treated with ozanimod, 
~55% in subjects rerandomized from ozanimod 1 mg to placebo, and ~65% in subjects continuously 
treated with placebo. 
In total, 824 of 1012 subjects (~81%) enrolled in RPC01-3101 went on to enrol in the OLE study, RPC01-

Recruitment 
The study recruited the first patient on 12 August 2015. The date of the last visit for the induction period 
was 21 May 2019. The last subject visit for the maintenance period was 27 March 2020.  
Conduct of the study 
There are 4 protocols (originals all dated 30 Mar 2015): the main protocol (version 1.0), the region 
protocol (for regions implementing contraception methods to aligned with the “Recommendations related 
to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” [15 Sep 2014] by the Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group), the protocol for Germany, and the protocol for Italy. The protocol for Italy was amended 8 times, 
the main protocol was amended 7 times, and the region protocol and protocol for Germany were 
amended twice to address local and regional requirements prior to the current versions. 
The main features of the protocol amendments are given in the following: 
-  Amendment 1 (June 2016):  
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 104/209 
 
 
 
 
 
PK analyses were amended to add a third metabolite to the analysis (based on the results of study 
RPC01-1901), definitions of maintenance of remission, mucosla and histologic remissioin were updated, 
as well as descriptions of Mayo 3-component and 4-component scores added, clarifications to the in- and 
exclusion criteria were included, details regarding the colonic biopsies were revised, and the time periods 
for collection of SF and RB diary entries were further defined, revision of the description of the primary 
efficacy analysis (odds ratio instead of relative risk), and addition of treatment failure rules. 
-  Amendment 2 (June 2017) 
Proportion of patients who could have previously received anti-TNF therapy from less or equal to 30% 
amended  to approximately 35% to reflect increasing use of the product(s), removal of several prohibited 
concomitant medications due to new PK data becoming available 
-  Amendment 3 (December 2017): 
Proportion of subject in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 adjusted to reinstate the original limit of ≤ 30% of subjects 
who have received anti-TNF, limit of ≤ 50% was established for Cohort 2. These limits were established 
based on ongoing development programs in UC that have confirmed that subjects with anti-TNF 
experience achieved limited clinical response. 
-  Amendment 4 (May 2018): 
A 75-day (± 10 days) Safety Follow-up Visit added to ensure adequate collection of AEs that could be 
associated with the investigational drug, additional assessment of ALC for subjects who had a confirmed 
ALC below the 200 cells/μL limit and permanently discontinued in order to evaluate the rebound effect 
after long-term exposure to ozanimod, visit windows for visits during the maintenance phase increased, 
BCRP inhibitors, CYP2C8 inzhibitors or inducers and MAO inghibitors added to the list of medications that 
were prohibited during the study, analysis method from the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method changed to the NRI method. 
-  Amendment 5 (November 2018): 
Adolescent subjects included (FDA request) via a separate cohort (Cohort 3) utilizing 2:1 randomization. 
Adolescent subjects who met clinical response criteria at the end of the Induction Period were to be re-
randomized into a controlled Maintenance Period, consistent with the current plan for adults. Subsequent 
changes for efficacy measures and statistical evaluation for this cohort were also implemented. 
For statistical analysis purposes, calculation of clinical remission and clinical response was changed to use

Baseline data 
The baseline demographic characteristics of subjects in the Induction Period were generally well balanced 
between groups and consistent with a population of subjects with moderate to severe UC, with the 
exception of a higher percentage of male subjects in the placebo group as compared to the ozanimod 
group and as compared to the cohort 2 subjects. The majority of patients were white and from the 
Eastern European region (with additional 10-16% from Western Europe) with other

was around 25%. 
The baseline demographics are shown in the following table:

Table 42: Demographics - Induction Period (ITT Population), Study RPC01-3101 (continued) 
The subjects continuing in the placebo group in the Maintenance Period continued to have a higher 
proportion of males (66.7%) compared to subjects rerandomized to placebo (53.7%) and subjects 
rerandomized to ozanimod (50.9%). The subjects continuing in the placebo group in the Maintenance 
Period had a higher proportion of subjects from Eastern Europe (71.0%) compared to subjects 
rerandomized to placebo (59.9%) and subjects rerandomized to ozanimod (52.6%).

The mean duration of UC symptoms at the beginning of the Induction Period for Cohort 1 was 
approximately 8 years, with a mean time since UC diagnosis of approximately 7 years. The mean 3-
component Mayo score at baseline was 6.6 and the mean 4-component Mayo score was approximately 9. 
Approximately 35% of subjects had a 4-component Mayo score > 9 at baseline. Approximately 38% of 
subjects had disease extent proximal to the left side of the colon. The median baseline CRP was slightly 
lower at 4.0 mg/L in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group and 5.0 mg/L in the placebo and Cohort 2 ozanimod 
groups. The median faecal calprotectin (FCP) was approximately 1080 mg/kg in the Cohort 1 ozanimod 
group, 1350 mg/kg in the placebo group, and 1260 mg/kg in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group.

The median 4-component Mayo score was 9.0 at screening for all subjects in the Maintenance Period. Of 
the subjects who remained on ozanimod, 41.3% had a 4-component Mayo score > 9 at baseline, 
compared with 27.8% who were re-randomized to placebo. The median baseline FCP was 1077.59 mg/kg

With regard to the medical history, disease states reported in more than 10% of the 
participants were the following: 
• 
In the induction period: 
Haemorrhoids (13.1% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 11.6% of subjects in the placebo 
group, and 8.7% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group) 
Anaemia (17.9% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 13.4% of subjects in the placebo group,

ozanimod) 
Concomitant medication at baseline: 
For the Induction Period, prior commonly used medications included medications used for endoscopic 
procedures (ie, fentanyl, propofol, midazolam). Other most common (ie, used by ≥ 15% of subjects in 
any group) prior medications for subjects in the Induction Period included ascorbic 
acid/potassium/sodium chloride/sodium sulfate and macrogol 4000, and macrogol 3350 (for bowel 
preparation) 
Almost all the subjects in Cohort 1 had had been previously treated with 5-ASAs (~97%), most of whom 
failed to respond (~75%) or were intolerant (~9%) (Table 14.1.8.2.1A). Approximately 75% of subjects 
had used corticosteroids, including ~46% who failed to respond, ~12% who were intolerant, and ~25% 
who were steroid-dependent. Approximately 41% of subjects had failed to respond and/or were intolerant 
to immunomodulators (primarily AZA or 6-MP). 
Additionally, patients failed or were intolerant to biologics, including anti-TNF and other biologics (such as 
vedolizumab). In Cohort 1, approximately 30% of subjects had an inadequate response, loss of response, 
or intolerance to anti-TNF use (as randomized). Of these subjects, 70/195 (~36%) failed to ever respond 
to at least 1 anti-TNF (primary nonresponse) and 126/195 (~65%) lost response to an anti-TNF 
(secondary nonresponse; 123/195 (~63%) had received 2 or more biologics and 91/195 (~47%) had 
received an integrin receptor blocker (ie, vedolizumab). Prior and concomitant treatment were similar for 
Cohort 2 with higher prior use of anti-TNF blocker use (43%) and vedolizumab in patients with prior anti-
TNF blocker use (55.3%). 
The data on prior medication are shown in the following table for the safety population:

Table 48: Prior Ulcerative Colitis Medication – Induction Period (Safety Population) 
The most commonly used (i.e., used by >15% of subjects in any group) prior biologics medications for 
subjects in the Induction Period included: 
- Adalimumab (11.9% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 18.5% of subjects in the placebo 
group, and 19.3% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group) 
- Infliximab (22.6% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 21.8% of subjects in the placebo group, 
and 34.1% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group) 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021

- Vedolizumab (16.6% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 17.6% of subjects in the placebo 
group, and 25.3% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group). 
For the Maintenance Period, prior commonly used medications included medications used for endoscopic 
procedures (quite similar to the induction period). Prior treatments for UC included 5-ASA in nearly all 
subjects (98%) corticosteroids in ~72%, immunomodulators in ~38%, anti-TNFs (as randomized) in 
~31%, and other biologics in ~16%. The table is not reproduced here and percentages are largely similar 
to the induction period. 
Concomitant medication 
Common concomitant medications for subjects in the Induction Period included medications used for 
endoscopy (e.g., propofol, midazolam, macrogol 4000). 
Subjects enrolling in the study were required to be treated with other concomitant therapies including 
aminosalicylates (eg, mesalazine 71% of total subjects; sulfasalazine 13% of total subjects). The most 
commonly used substances were: 
- Mesalazine (69.5% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 65.3% of subjects in the placebo group, 
and 74.9% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group) 
- Sulfasalazine (15.6% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 14.4% of subjects in the placebo 
group, and 9.8% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group) 
Concomitant corticosteroids for systemic use were used in 27.7% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod 
group, 32.4% of subjects in the placebo group, and 33.8% of subjects in Cohort 2 ozanimod group. In 
total, ~31% of subjects in the Induction Period were on concomitant oral corticosteroids.  
The most commonly used corticosteroid for subjects in the Induction Period was prednisone (18.1% of 
subjects ozanimod total, 16.1% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 17.6% of subjects in the 
placebo group, and 20.4% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group). Budesonide was used 
concomitantly by 4.4% of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group, 6.0% of subjects in the placebo 
group, and 6.3% of subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group. 
Concomitant medication during the maintenance phase showed a tendency for lower rates of using these 
medications, with no substantial qualitative differences. 
Treatment compliance was generally high during the study with approximately 100% across treatment 
groups during the Induction Period and approximately 98% to 99% across treatment groups during the 
Maintenance Period.  
Numbers analysed 
In the ITT Population of the Induction Period, there were a total of 429 subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod 
group, 216 subjects in the placebo group, and 367 subjects in the Cohort 2 ozanimod group. Reasons for 
exclusion from the PP Population of the Induction Period included treatment deviation, randomization 
procedure, excluded concomitant medication use, and selection criteria not met.

Table 49: Analysis Populations – Induction Period 
In the ITT population of the Maintenance Period, there were a total of 69 subjects in the placebo group, 
227 subjects rerandomized to placebo, and 230 subjects rerandomized to ozanimod. Reasons for 
exclusion from the PP Population of the Maintenance Period included excluded concomitant medication 
use and selection criteria not met. 
Table 50: Analysis Populations – Maintenance Period 
Protocol deviations: 
A protocol deviation was defined as a deviation from the approved protocol version (valid at that time for 
that particular subject). Non-compliance with the study protocol, whether subject- or procedure-related, 
was classified into two categories, major and minor. A major protocol deviation was defined as a 
deviation that may impact the safety, health, and well-being of subjects; or the integrity and validity of 
the clinical study data. Major deviations could include items such as not signing the most recent version 
of the ICF, or administration of investigational product outside storage conditions, in addition to items 
such as receiving prohibited medications and missing assessments. In Cohort 1 of the Induction Period, 7 
(1.6%) subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg arm and 2 (0.9%) subjects in the placebo arm were excluded from 
the Per Protocol Population due to at least 1 major protocol deviation (see above)). Reasons for exclusion 
included treatment deviation, incorrect randomization procedure, use of excluded concomitant 
medications, and selection criteria not met. 
The following tables display the total number of major protocol deviations from the induction as well as 
the maintenance period:

Outcomes and estimation 
Induction Period – Week 10: Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
A highly statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the Cohort 1 ozanimod group (18.4%) 
achieved clinical remission using the 3-component Mayo definition, 7-day scoring algorithm compared to 
the placebo group (6.0%) at Week 10 of the Induction Period using NRI. The Cohort 2 ozanimod group 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 118/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had a similar rate of remission (21.0%) to the Cohort 1 ozanimod group. The results are shown in the 
following table 
Table 53: Proportion of Subjects in Clinical Remission (3-component Mayo Definition Using 7-
day Scoring Algorithm) at Week 10 - Induction Period (ITT Population, Non-Responder 
Imputation) 
Results from all sensitivity analyses, including analysis of the Induction PP Population, analyses using 
alternative missing data handling methods and analyses using 4-component Mayo and additional 
alternative definitions of clinical remission, were consistent with the primary analysis using NRI with the 
7-day scoring algorithm and support the robustness of the results.  
Regarding the tipping point analysis of clinical remission at Week 10, the area marked as “Not Significant” 
is about [(12×28)/2] / (27×45) = 13.8% of the entire area, while the area marked as “Significant: RPC 
treatment favored over Placebo” is about 86.2% of the entire area. Most of the results in this tipping 
point sensitivity analysis being consistent with the primary analysis of clinical remission at Week 10 
demonstrates the robustness of the primary analysis. The same conclusion can be reached for the tipping 
point analysis of clinical response at Week 10.

A highly statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects who were rerandomized toozanimod 
(ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group) (37.0%) achieved clinical remission using the 3-
component Mayo definition, 7-day scoring algorithm compared to subjects rerandomized to placebo 
(ozanimod 1 mg – placebo treatment group) (18.5%) at Week 52 of the Maintenance Period using NRI (p 
< 0.0001). Among subjects continuously treated with placebo, 24.6% were in clinical remission at Week 
52. The results are displayed in the following table:

Table 55: Proportion of Subjects in Clinical Remission (3-component Mayo Definition Using 7-
day Scoring Algorithm) at Week 52 of Total Treatment - Maintenance Period (ITT Population, 
Non-Responder Imputation) 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in clinical remission at Week 52 in the re-
randomized ozanimod group compared to the re-randomized placebo group was also observed when 
sensitivity analyses were performed using observed cases (p = 0.0050) and multiple imputation (p< 
0.0009), as well as using Induction Cohort stratification (i.e., Cohort 1 or Cohort 2; p< 0.0001;) and the 
PP Population (p< 0.0001). 
Supplementary analyses showed that a higher proportion of subjects re-randomized to ozanimod also 
achieved clinical remission compared to the re-randomized placebo group when using the 14-day scoring 
algorithm A (p< 0.0001) and 14-day scoring algorithm B (p< 0.0001, when using the 4-component Mayo 
definition and when using alternative definition 1, alternative definition 2 (p< 0.0001) and alternative 
definition 3 (p< 0.0001), and when excluding 9 subjects from Site 677. 
A high percentage of missing data at Week 52 in ozanimod 1 mg-placebo arm (43.2%, 98/227) versus 
26.5% (61/230) in the ozanimod 1 mg-ozanimod 1 mg arm, and a high percentage of subjects in 
ozanimod 1 mg-placebo arm who discontinued early due to “maintenance disease relapse” (74.8%, 
77/103) limits the ability to reach a meaningful conclusion from the tipping point analysis of clinical 
remission based on missing data.

the proportion of adult patients with clinical response, remission, or endoscopic improvement at Week 10 
in adult patients who previously received anti-TNF therapy, the Change in the SF-36 and the EQ-5D from 
Baseline to Week 10, Health resource utilization at Week 10, and Work productivity at Week 10. 
- 
Change in Mayo Scores: 
In Cohort 1, subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg group showed nominally significant decreases in 3- 
component (-2.4 versus -1.4) and 4-component (-3.2 versus -1.7) Mayo score from Baseline to Week 10 
compared with those in the placebo group (p < 0.001 for each analysis; RPC01-3101). Nominally 
significant decreases in partial Mayo score from Baseline to Week 5 (-2.3 versus -1.5) and from Baseline 
to Week 10 (-2.7 versus -1.5) were also observed for subjects treated with ozanimod versus those 
treated with placebo (p < 0.001 for each analysis). 
- 
Histological Remission. 
The definition of histological remission was Geboes Score < 2.0, indicating no neutrophils in the epithelial 
crypts or lamina propria and no increase in eosinophils, no crypt destruction, and no erosions ulcerations 
or granulation tissue). The results are shown in the following table:

Change in SF-36 
While scores on the SF-36 generally improved for subjects randomized to either ozanimod or placebo in 
Cohort 1 during the Induction Period, the Cohort 1 ozanimod group had nominally significantly improved 
scores on the Physical Component Summary (PCS; p < 0.001), but not Mental Component Summary 
(MCS; p = 0.105), at Week 10 relative to placebo. 
Individual domain scores improved relative to placebo on all physical health components, including 
physical functioning (p = 0.003), role-physical (p < 0.001), bodily pain (p < 0.001), and general health 
(p < 0.001). Scores improved on mental health components versus placebo, including vitality (p = 
0.003), social functioning (p < 0.001), and mental health (p = 0.022), but not role-emotional (p = 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 130/209 
 
 
 
 
 
0.624). Scores also improved on the SF-36 global health (p < 0.001) and health utility score (p = 0.013;) 
for ozanimod versus placebo. 
The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the SF-36 PCS and MCS scores was defined as a ≥ 
5 point improvement in each summary score. For the SF-36 PCS, a nominally significantly greater 
proportion of subjects on ozanimod achieved an MCID compared to placebo (48.64% versus 33.68%; p = 
0.0006). No difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved an MCID in the SF-36 MCS was 
observed. 
- 
Change in EQ-5D 
The Cohort 1 ozanimod group also had nominally significantly improved scores on the EQ-5D Summary 
Index (p = 0.003) and EQ-5D Visual Analogue Scale (p < 0.001) relative to placebo at Week 10. 
- 
Health resource utilisation 
A low overall number of doctor visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in the Induction Period 
made inferring treatment group differences in health-resource utilisation difficult. 
On the WPAI-UC, the Cohort 1 ozanimod group generally had fewer hours missed due to UC, lower 
degree UC affected work productivity and regular activities, less absenteeism and higher presenteeism, 
and less percentage of overall work and daily activity impairment due to UC relative to placebo 
- 
Biomarkers (faecal calprotectin): 
Ozanimod 1 mg reduced markers of intestinal inflammation. At Baseline, the mean FCP levels in Cohort 1 
were approximately 2500 μg/g in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 3400 μg/g inthe placebo 
treatment group. The mean change from Baseline at Week 10 was nominally significantly greater with 
ozanimod 1 mg compared with placebo (-470.231 μg/g versus 21.115 μg/g, respectively; p = 0.002). 
In Cohort 1, nominally significantly greater proportions of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg had a 
decrease from Baseline FCP > 50 μg/g to ≤ 50 μg/g at Week 10, from a Baseline of> 100 μg/g to ≤ 100 
μg/g at Week 10, and from a Baseline of > 150 μg/g to ≤ 150 μg/g at Week 10 compared with those 
treated with placebo (p < 0.001 for each analysis). A post hoc analysis also showed that a nominally 
significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg also had a decrease from Baseline 
FCP > 250 μg/g to FCP ≤ 250 μg/g at Week 10 compared with those treated with placebo (37.8% versus 
15.0%; p < 0.0001). 
Post Hoc defined endpoints:  
Change from BL in RBS and SFS and symptomatic responder rates.: 
In order to evaluate the onset of action of ozanimod, post hoc analyses were performed to assess 
symptomatic improvement in RBS and SFS over time. Symptomatic improvements in RBS and SFS 
appeared to separate with ozanimod 1 mg relative to placebo as early as Week 2 (ie, 1 week after 
completing the 7-day dose escalation) with a continuous increase in separation from placebo through 
Week 10 (Figure 3). In Cohort 1, significantly greater LS mean reduction from Baseline in RBS was 
observed with ozanimod 1 mg compared with placebo starting at Week 2 (LS mean estimate: -0.56 
versus -0.40, respectively; estimated treatment difference -0.16, 95% CI: -0.298, -0.023;). While there 
was a trend toward separation in SFS at Week 2 with ozanimod 1 mg versus placebo (LS mean estimate: 
-0.36 versus -0.27, respectively; estimated treatment difference -0.09, 95% CI: -0.215, 0.045), a 
significant separation was observed starting at Week 5 (LS mean estimate: -0.65 versus -0.46, 
respectively; estimated treatment difference -0.19, 95% CI: -0.336, -0.047). 
The results are displayed in the following two figures:

Population, Observed Cases) – Study RPC01-3101 
In addition to this “numerical” evaluation of the symptomatic scores, the applicant also defined a post-
hoc responder definition for the two-component symptomatic remission. A nominally significantly greater 
proportion of subjects achieved symptomatic remission with ozanimod 1 mg than with placebo at Week 
10 of the Induction Period (37.5% versus 18.5%; p < 0.0001). 
Endoscopic normalisation: 
Endoscopic normalization was defined as a Mayo endoscopy subscore of 0. In Cohort 1, a numerically 
greater proportion of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg met the criteria for endoscopic normalization 
at Week 10 compared with those treated with placebo, although the result did not reach nominal 
significance (6.1% versus 2.8%; p = 0.0685)

Change in the SF-36 and the EQ-5D from Baseline to Week 52 
Scores on SF-36 generally improved during the Maintenance Period for subjects rerandomized to either 
ozanimod or placebo; however, the subjects re randomized to ozanimod had nominally significantly 
improved scores on the PCS (p = 0.016), but not MCS (p = 0.432), at Week 52 relative to those 
rerandomized to placebo. 
Scores improved relative to placebo for the physical health components role-physical (p = 0.031) and 
general health (p = 0.002), but not physical functioning (p = 0.065), bodily pain (p = 0.338), while 
scores did not improve relative to placebo on the mental health components vitality (p = 0.216), social 
functioning (p = 0.166), role-emotional (p = 0.538), or mental health (p = 0.264). Scores improved on 
the SF-36 global health (p = 0.005), but not health utility score (p = 0.096). 
For the SF-36 PCS, a nominally significantly greater proportion of subjects treated with ozanimod 
achieved an MCID (improvement of ≥ 5 points) compared to placebo at Week 52 (69.4% versus 57.5%; p 
= 0.03). No difference in the proportion of subjects achieving an MCID in the SF-36 MCS was observed. 
The rerandomized ozanimod group also had nominally significantly improved scores on the EQ-5D Visual 
Analogue Scale (p = 0.005, but not the EQ-5D Summary Index (p = 0.428) relative to the group 
rerandomized to placebo, at Week 52. 
- 
Health resource utilization at 28 weeks, 40 weeks, and at Week 52 
A low overall number of doctor visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in the Maintenance 
Period made inferring treatment group differences in HRU difficult. The HRU score collects data on 
reported doctor visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations in the Maintenance Period. In order to 
examine the reasons for hospitalizations for UC within the trial, a post hoc analysis of subjects requiring 
hospitalizations during the Maintenance Period due to UC-related AEs (as defined by anemia, dehydration, 
worsening, flare, or relapse of UC) as reported by the investigator was conducted. The analysis 
demonstrated a lower proportion of subjects re-randomized to ozanimod (5/16, 31%) compared with 
those re-randomized to placebo (10/19, 53%) experienced hospitalizations due to UC. 
- 
Work productivity at 28 weeks, 40 weeks, and at Week 52 
On the WPAI-UC, the re-randomized ozanimod group generally had fewer hours missed due to UC, lower 
degree UC affected work productivity and regular activities, less absenteeism due to UC, and less 
percentage of overall work and daily activity impairment due to UC relative to the group re-randomized to 
placebo. 
The following post-hoc analyses were conducted and reported in the study report: 
Proportion of Subjects with Symptomatic Remission: A nominally significantly greater proportion of 
subjects re-randomized to ozanimod achieved symptomatic remission compared to subjects re-
randomized to placebo at Week 52 of the Maintenance Period (51.3% versus 33.5%; p < 0.0001). 
Time to Relapse 
Relapse was defined as an increase in partial Mayo score of ≥ 2 points compared to the Week 10 partial 
Mayo score with an absolute partial Mayo score ≥ 4 points AND an endoscopic subscore of ≥ 2 points. A 
nominally significantly lower proportion of subjects re-randomized to ozanimod experienced relapse 
during the Maintenance Period compared to subjects re-randomized to placebo (81 [35.7%] subjects 
versus 31 [13.5%] subjects, p < 0.001). A Kaplan-Meier plot of time to relapse is shown in the following:

Ancillary analyses 
The following subgroups were investigated, and reported for both, the induction as well as the 
maintenance periods: Corticosteroid use (yes/no), prior anti-TNF therapy (yes/no), moderate UC status 
at baseline (yes/no), baseline complete Mayo Score (>9/≤9), extent of colitis (left-sided/extensive), sex 
(male/female), age at screening (cut-off 40 years), level of faecal calprotectin (cut-off 250 mg/ml), ALCs 
at baseline (cut-off 1500 106/l), Region (North America, Western Europe/Eastern Europe/Asia 
Pacific/South America/South Africa), baseline partial Mayo Score (<median vs >median), and baseline 
endoscopic subscore (2 vs 3). 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (clinical remission at Week 10) and key secondary endpoints 
(clinical response, endoscopic improvement, and mucosal healing at Week 10) demonstrated a consistent 
treatment effect in favour of ozanimod 1 mg over placebo across almost all subgroups analysed, 
underscoring the robustness of the efficacy data. 
The results of the analyses on clinical remission and mucosal healing are shown in graphical form in the 
following two figures:

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No pooled data have been submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations are presented. Patients above the age of 65 were included to a marginal 
extent only and patients of the age of 75 or older were not included into the study. The SmPC reflects 
that data for >65 is scarce and not considered meaningful. 
Supportive study(ies) 
The applicant has additionally conducted a long-term open-label extension study which has of course, the 
primary objective of demonstrating safety. However, efficacy data from this trial will be reported in the 
following. 
Study RPC01-3102: 
Study RPC01-3102 is an ongoing Phase 3, multi-center, OLE study designed to evaluate the long-term 
safety and efficacy of ozanimod in subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Only subjects who had 
previously participated in Study RPC01-3101 or the OLP of Study RPC01-202 and met eligibility criteria 
were eligible for entry in this study. Subjects who entered the study from an open-label parent study or 
treatment period of ozanimod (i.e., from the OLP of Study RPC01-202 or Induction Period Cohort 2 of 
Study RPC01-3101) continued to receive ozanimod 1 mg QD. All subjects entering the study from a 
blinded parent study or treatment period of ozanimod (i.e., Induction Period Cohort 1 or the Maintenance 
Period of Study RPC01-3101) initiated ozanimod 1 mg treatment in accordance with the 7-day dose 
escalation regimen. 
Subjects who had not achieved clinical response or remission at RPC01-3102 study entry were to be 
discontinued from ozanimod if they did not show clinical improvement from the Baseline visit of Study 
RPC01-3102 to Week 10. 
Subjects remaining in the study will receive ozanimod 1 mg QD until the end of 2021 or until marketing 
authorization is obtained in their country, whichever comes first. 
Results reported by the applicant are as of the data cut-off date of 31 Mar 2020. 
A total of 878 subjects enrolled in this ongoing study, including 824 subjects from parent Study RPC01-
3101 and 54 subjects from parent Study RPC01-202 OLP. These latter 54 patients did not have an 
efficacy evaluation as of the data-cut-off, and therefore are not included in the following tables. 
As of the data cut-off date (31 Mar 2020), 52.4% of subjects in the RPC01-3101 total group completed 
the Week 46 Visit, while 38.7% of subjects withdrew from investigational product. The most frequently 
reported reasons for study treatment discontinuation were lack of efficacy (18.9% of subjects), 
withdrawal by subject (11.9% of subjects), and AE (3.4% of subjects). Subjects who had not achieved 
clinical response or remission at study entry were instructed to discontinue from the study if no clinical 
improvement from Study RPC01-3102 Baseline was observed by Week 10.

Ulcerative colitis disease history for subjects who entered the OLE was assessed at the parent study 
Baseline. There were no notable differences in baseline disease characteristics across parent study 
treatment groups for subjects in the OLE ITT Population and the disease characteristics were consistent 
with the overall ITT Population of the parent study. For the RPC01-3101 total group, the mean (SD) and 
median 4-component Mayo score at Baseline was 8.9 (1.44) and 9.0, respectively, with 36.3% of 
subjects having a 4-component Mayo score (by central reader) at Baseline > 9. The mean (SD) and 
median 3-component Mayo score at Baseline was 6.7 (1.22) and 7.0, respectively. In total, 31.9% of 
subjects in the RPC01- 3101 total group were using systemic corticosteroids at screening and 33.7% had 
prior anti-TNF use at screening (based on the concomitant medication electronic case report form 
[eCRF]). 41.9% had a prior use of (conventional) immunosuppressants, and 97.7% had a prior use of 
aminosalicylates. 
Given the number of different mechanisms by which subjects entered the OLE, there was a large range of 
exposure prior to entry into, as well as during the OLE. The mean (median) exposure to investigational 
product in the OLE for subjects in the RPC01- 3101 total group and subjects in the RPC01-202 OLP group 
was 1.17 (0.94) years and 0.85 (0.86) years, respectively. Of note, the 54 subjects who enrolled from 
Study RPC01-202 OLP had additional (up to 5.5 years) exposure to ozanimod 1 mg in the parent study. 
The mean (median) exposure to study drug overall (including parent study) for subjects in the RPC01-
3101 total group and subjects in the RPC01-202 OLP group was 1.75 (1.60) years and 6.07 (6.04) years, 
respectively. The overall maximum duration of exposure (including parent study) was 4.6 years for 
subjects from parent study RPC01-3101 and 6.8 years for subjects from parent study RPC01-202 OLP. 
There were 389 subjects (47.4%) in the RPC01-3101 total group and 5 subjects (9.3%) in the RPC01-202 
OLP group who were treated with ozanimod for > 1 year in OLE Study RPC01- 3102 (RPC01-3102 CSR. 
No efficacy data are available for the 54 subjects who enrolled from the parent Study RPC01-202 OLP, 
due to insufficient follow-up time for those subjects at the time of the Study RPC01-3102 data cutoff 
date.  
Regardless of the duration of treatment in the parent study, of the 821 subjects in the RPC01- 3101 total 
group who completed all the assessments required for the efficacy endpoints (RBS, SFS, and endoscopy), 
42.7% of subjects were in clinical remission and the majority of subjects (78.2%) had clinical response 
(3-component Mayo definition) at Week 46. Nearly half of subjects (49.9%) also met the criteria for 
endoscopic improvement and 40.9% had corticosteroid-free remission at Week 46. 
Overall, long-term efficacy of ozanimod 1 mg was generally maintained at Weeks 94 and 142 for clinical 
remission (49.4% and 41.5%, respectively), clinical response (82.6% and 80.4%, respectively), 
endoscopic improvement (56.6% and 47.6%, respectively), and corticosteroid-free remission (48.1% and 
35.8%, respectively). Of the subjects in the RPC01-3101 total group who achieved clinical remission or 
clinical response at RPC01-3102 study entry (responders by 3-component Mayo score using the 7-day 
algorithm), the majority of subjects generally maintained clinical remission (69.6% of subjects) and 
clinical response (93.9%), met the criteria for endoscopic improvement (71.8%), and had corticosteroid-
free remission (68.7%). As with the overall population, long-term remission was generally maintained at 
Weeks 94 and 142 for subjects who were responders at study entry.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The applicant has conducted and presented a development program for UC, consisting of one phase 2 trial 
with  dose-finding  aspects,  and  1  pivotal  phase  3  study,  which  consisted  of  an  induction  part  with  two 
cohorts, and a maintenance part with re-randomisation of responders. Additionally, long-term, open label 
follow up data were presented. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical and endoscopic benefits of ozanimod therapy have been adequately targeted. The parameters 
studied include clinical endpoints, inclusive of patient-reported outcomes (PROs; rectal bleeding and stool

frequency) as well as endoscopic targets, all of which were achieved in the trial. Using a stringent 
requirement of being off corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks at Week 52, a statistical benefit of 
ozanimod in corticosteroid-free remission was demonstrated at the end of the maintenance period. 
Superior efficacy for ozanimod 1 mg relative to placebo was shown in the clinical, endoscopic, and 
histologic measures of UC disease activity in the well-controlled pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial as well as a 
supportive dose-ranging Phase 2 study in moderate to severe UC. The trials enrolled subjects 
representative of a broad patient population who were intolerant to or failed conventional therapies, 
including corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators such as 6-MP, AZA, or MTX, and those who had 
primary or secondary nonresponse to an anti-TNF or other biologic therapy or were intolerant to either 
treatment. 
Moderate to Severe UC, partial unmet medical need and development rationale for ozanimod 
The applicant has chosen to develop ozanimod as a treatment in patients with moderate to severe 
ulcerative colitis, which have previously had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to 
either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. 
The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects is not fully elucidated, is thought to involve 
lymphocyte retention in lymphoid tissues and the reduction of lymphocyte migration to sites of 
inflammation including the central nervous system and intestine. The reduction of peripheral lymphocyte 
counts has been clearly demonstrated. The product has already been licensed for the treatment of 
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in 2020, and the planning and conduct of the development 
programme in UC was in parallel with the development in this first indication. The biological rationale, and 
therapeutic value of the compound have therefore already been demonstrated. Based on this, and on the 
fact that ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease, for which the retention of 
lymphocytes in the lymphoid tissue has the potential to prevent recruitment of additional inflammatory 
cells, local release of proinflammatory cytokines, and ongoing damage to the colonic mucosa, the 
rationale for the UC development is sufficiently justified. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has presented a comprehensive programme for the development of ozanimod in the UC 
indication.  
The initial study conducted (RPC01-202) was planned based on studies available in healthy volunteers 
demonstrating a saturation of the peripheral lymphocyte reduction in the dose range between 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg daily. The study was, however, not explicitly planned as a dose-finding trial, but – for the 
statistical planning – included an induction period of 9 weeks (including 1 week of dose escalation), and a 
24-week extension period in a “treat-through” design, during which patients were retained in the 
originally assigned treatment group in case they had responded to treatment in the induction period. The 
study was conducted as a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, multi-national trial.  
The included patient population did require the presence of moderate to severe disease, but not 
necessarily a previous treatment and insufficient response, lost response or intolerance to biologics or 
conventional immunosuppressants.  
The evaluation of efficacy was mainly based on the 4-component Mayo Score and comprised categorical 
endpoints such as remission, response, and improvement, but also the evaluation of endoscopy, as well 
as histology. While the study does not fully reflect the requirements for a “pivotal” study as requested by 
the CHMP UC guideline, it must be acknowledged that it is acceptable overall that not so strict endpoints, 
and a wider patient population are included into early, non-pivotal studies. Nevertheless, the study by its 
character of a confirmatory approach and by including a prolonged, blinded treatment period of 6 months 
is a relevant study, well supporting the pivotal study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 155/209 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal study for the programme, study RPC01-3101 comprised two cohorts of patients for induction 
treatment, one treated open-label with ozanimod 1 mg, and one cohort randomised to placebo or 
ozanimod 1 mg, for a duration of 10 weeks. Patients from both cohorts experiencing “response” after the 
initial treatment period, were then re-randomised to active treatment with ozanimod 1 mg daily or 
placebo for a treatment duration of additional 42 weeks to match a total duration of treatment of 52 
weeks.  
The trial design is fully compliant with the regulatory requirements, except for the fact that usually, the 
conduct of 2 randomised induction trials is expected. With the relevant design of the phase 2 trial and the 
overall supporting nature of this study, the presentation of only one pivotal trial for the short-term 
treatment can be accepted considering also that criteria related to “one pivotal study are met in term of 
data quality, robustness.  
The study included a patient population with moderate to severe disease as defined by the 4-component 
Mayo score and required a compulsory ongoing treatment with either 5-aminosalicylates and/or 
corticosteroids, and with prior treatment with conventional immunosuppressants and/or biologics (anti-
TNFs and vedolizumab). Insufficient treatment response, or intolerance was not compulsorily required at 
entry, but most patients finally complied with the claimed indication (see below). The selection of the 
patient population is therefore considered adequate and reflects the intended target population. The only 
drawback was related to the upper age limit set to 75, resulting in a very small proportion of patients in 
the higher age range.  
The evaluation of efficacy was mainly based on the use of the Mayo Score, which is an established tool for 
the evaluation of disease activity in UC. In this trial, however, the element of subjectivity within this 
score, the physician’s global assessment part was for the most part omitted from the efficacy evaluation, 
which is compliant with the regulatory recommendations. The main endpoint used was the “3-component 
Mayo score” which was termed “clinical remission” and includes a normalisation or near normalisation of 
the symptoms rectal bleeding and stool frequency and of the endoscopic appearance of the large bowel 
mucosa. While this composite endpoint is the recommended endpoint as per FDA guideline, the CHMP 
guideline requests the use of the co-primary evaluation of stool frequency and rectal bleeding on one 
hand, on for healing of the large bowel mucosa on the other hand. Efficacy would be concluded only in 
cases when both of these criteria have been fulfilled, in order to exclude that the “composite” efficacy 
would be based on one of these 2 parts only, which could leave either patients not significantly 
benefitting on their subjective symptoms, or not significantly benefitting from the healing of the mucosa, 
which has been shown to be predictive of the long-term outcome in the disease. The choice of the 
primary endpoint, both for the induction, as well as the maintenance part of the trial is therefore not 
compliant with the current CHMP requirements. 
 While the planning of the trial was clearly initiated at the time when the current CHMP recommendations 
were under revisions, the final recommendations of the guideline could still have been implemented for 
the final analysis. However, this omission appears to be of minor relevance, due to the results of the trial 
and also because part of the required analyses were provided post hoc. The trial also included a variety of 
other endpoints, including clinical response, endoscopic improvement, mucosal healing, histologic 
remission, or ,  for the maintenance phase  corticosteroid free remission, and “maintenance of remission”, 
which are thought to be of high clinical relevance. The applicant has also post-hoc taken account new 
requirements related to estimands to demonstrate which estimand strategy has been implicitly followed 
for the trial (composite strategy), which is appreciated. 
Although the trail protocol was amended relatively frequently, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated 
adherence to GCP. Therefore, trial planning as well as conduct do not raise relevant concerns.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
- 
Phase 2 study RPC01-202: 
The phase 2 study has demonstrated for the induction period, that a clinical remission can be induced in a 
statistically significantly different proportion of patients compared to placebo with the higher dose of 1 mg 
ozanimod (16.4% as compared to 6.2%), while the lower dose of ozanimod was achieving a lower rate of 
remission, not demonstrating statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance can only be 
concluded in confirmatory manner for the chosen primary endpoint for the high dose. 
 he planned evaluation of the study included a hierarchical testing of the secondary endpoints with control 
of the type-1 error, but regarded any further testing as exploratory only, once the preceding tests had 
failed. Therefore, the further demonstration of efficacy with “nominally” significant results of the higher 
dose for the change in baseline of the Mayo Score, for endoscopic improvement, and 3-component clinical 
remission, and response have to be regarded to be “exploratory” only. The results of the 24-week 
extension period showed similar results, but with “nominal” statistical significance demonstrated 
consistently in both groups. However, this part of the study was not planned to be evaluated in 
confirmatory manner and was also hampered by the high rates of drop-outs. Nevertheless, both doses 
indicated the potential for long-term efficacy, with having more than 25% of the patients in (3-
component) remission at the end of the 33-week treatment, as compared to only just under 8% for 
placebo. While the results of the induction period do clearly indicate a higher activity and clinical efficacy 
of the higher dose, the results of the long-term treatment period are somewhat ambiguous. The 
modelling exercise conducted by the applicant, however, determined the 1 mg dose as the most 
appropriate. In conclusion, the choice of the dose, both for the induction as well as the maintenance 
phase of the pivotal study can be considered acceptable, which is also based on the fact that no relevant 
differences with regard to safety (see below) do exist for the two doses. 
- 
Pivotal study RPC01-3101: 
In the induction period, there was a consistently higher improvement in all parameters tested for 
measuring clinical efficacy. The rate of “clinical”  ( a composite of clinical and endoscopic items) 3-
component remission was tripled (18.4% vs. 6.0%) after 10 weeks of treatment compared to placebo, 
and the rate of clinical response almost reached half of the patients (47.8% compared to 25.9%). Similar 
superiority of the active treatment were seen for the endoscopic and histological evaluations of the 
mucosa (endoscopic improvement: 27.3% vs. 11.6%; mucosal healing 12.6% vs. 3.7%, and histologic 
remission 18.2% vs. 7.4%), the latter two of which can be regarded to be highly predictive of the long-
term outcome of the disease.  
The applicant has also evaluated post-hoc CHMP endpoint of a two-component symptomatic remission 
(“clinical remission”), which resulted in a rate of 37.5% under active, and 18.5% under placebo 
treatment. All these results were highly statistically significant, with p-values usually lower than 0.0001, 
and a minority showing p-values lower than 0.001.  
With this post-hoc analysis, the requirements of the CHMP guideline are fulfilled in complete manner, 
although the 2-component symptom responder evaluation was introduced only post-hoc. However, since 
there is a high consistency for the statistical evaluation across the full range of endpoints, this can be 
regarded to be a minor.  
Overall, it was considered demonstrated that patients are benefitting from treatment both for the 
improvement of symptoms as well as for the improvement of their long-term prognosis from this 
treatment in similar way, and there is no discordance between symptoms and endoscopic appearance of 
the mucosa. Additional “sensitivity analyses” for imputation of missing data, or using a different 
estimand, or using a conventional per-protocol analysis showed high consistency. Relevant subgroups 
analyses similarly showed high consistency across almost all subgroups evaluated. In a similar way, 
Assessment report

partly significant advantages of the active treatment group were shown in the evaluation of quality of life 
and showed consistent effects on work productivity. No relevant differences were seen for health care 
utilisation. The biomarkers (faecal calprotectin) investigated indicated also relevant advantages for the 
active treatment against placebo. 
For the maintenance phase, the trial demonstrated that the rate of 3-component clinical remission was 
doubled in the included patient population having responded to induction treatment (37.0 vs. 18.5%). 
The clinical response achieved reached 60% in total in those actively treated (vs. 41.0% on placebo), 
while rate of endoscopic improvement, mucosal healing and histologic remission also doubled. The 
applicant also showed that remission could be maintained in more than half of the patients that initially 
had achieved remission (51.9%), as compared to only 29.3% on placebo. The rates of relapse was almost 
3-times higher in the placebo treated patients (13.5% vs. 35.7%). The CHMP-UC-guideline endpoint 
“symptomatic remission” also showed clear superiority (51.0% vs. 33.5%).  
The applicant evaluated corticosteroid-free remission only for the 3-component Mayo “clinical remission” 
which also demonstrate superiority (31.7% vs. 16.7%). In fact, the applicant should have evaluated the 
two-component symptomatic remission, as well as the mucosal healing endpoints with the condition of 
being corticosteroid free at the final analysis, which would be fully compliant with the European 
requirements. Overall, all endpoints showed highly statistically significant differences, with p-values in the 
same range as reported for the induction period. The highest p-value (for the “maintenance of remission” 
endpoint) showed a p-value of 0.0025. Again, several sensitivity analyses were conducted which yielded 
consistent results, and again, the conducted subgroup analyses also showed highly concordant results 
across most of the criteria, with the same exceptions as mentioned for the induction phase. Again, 
Quality of Life scores improved relevantly, across most subdomains, and work productivity was higher 
with active treatment. The analysis of health care utilisation did not demonstrate fully consistent results 
due to the low number of events in total. However, a lower proportion of subjects receiving ozanimod 
were hospitalised during the observation period as compared to placebo. 
The applicant has also presented the long-term extension studies of the phase 2, as well as of the phase 
3 study, which do indicate that efficacy can be maintained over longer periods than one year. However, 
due to the nature of the studies with a selected patient population, and without control group, conclusions 
regarding efficacy to be drawn are limited. 
Overall, the presented studies do indicate a high level of treatment success which appears to be clinically 
highly relevant. Although the rates of clinical remission appear to be numerically small, these are fully in 
the range of other compounds that have been licensed during the last years, or even better. The “small” 
effect sizes are considered to owe to the fact that the success criteria are indeed relatively strict. 
However, this takes account of the fact that the treatment paradigms in IBD are currently changing from 
the “induction and maintenance” with improvement of symptoms, to a “treat to target” approach. For 
this, any new choice of product that addresses the partial unmet need in patients not sufficiently treated 
with the current armamentarium will be welcomed. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  has  convincingly  demonstrated  superiority  of  the  treatment  with  ozanimod  1  mg  daily  in 
patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis that have had an insufficient response to treatments with 
conventional treatment or with biologics.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The main safety issues identified in the clinical program of ozanimod in the approved MS indication were 
small and transient decreases in heart rate (HR), which occurred mainly during titration and were 
symptomatic in few cases only (bradyarrhythmia), macular oedemas, reversible and mainly 
asymptomatic increases in liver enzymes and reversible (within three months of treatment cessation) 
decreases in ALC (lymphopenia), an increased risk of herpes zoster infections with long-term treatment, 
and a disproportionately higher incidence in malignancies with ozanimod vs. IFN β-1a (i.e. the active 
comparator in the MS studies). 
The long-term risk for serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies could not be sufficiently   
characterised within the limited duration of clinical MS studies and thus prompted pharmacovigilance 
activity post-marketing including a Healthcare Professional checklist and Patient/caregiver’s guide. 
Clinical safety of ozanimod in the newly proposed indication (i.e. treatment of ulcerative colitis; UC) is 
based on the data obtained from a total of 10 clinical studies of ozanimod across all indications, including 
9 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies and 1 clinical pharmacology study.  
In subjects with UC, 2 controlled studies have been completed and 1 open-label extension study is 
ongoing. (RPC01-3102). 
In subjects with CD, 1 Phase 2 open-label study has been completed (RPC01-2201) and 1 Phase 3 open-
label extension study is ongoing (RPC01-3204). 
● In subjects with MS, 1 Phase 2 study with a core period and an extension period has been completed 
(RPC01-201 Part A), 2 pivotal Phase 3 controlled studies have been completed (RPC01-201 Part B and 
RPC01-301), and 1 Phase 3 open-label extension study is ongoing (RPC01-3001). These studies provided 
the evidence to support the approval/ registration of ozanimod for the treatment of MS in the US and in 
Europe. 
For ongoing studies, the safety cut-off date was 31 Mar 2020. 
The MAH presented in the safety overview the pooled placebo-controlled Induction Periods from the 
Phase 2 study and Phase 3 Cohort 1 and the randomized withdrawal Maintenance Period from the Phase 3 
study (3101 MP). Based on the known biology of S1P modulators special attention was directed at 
assessing cardiac effects, hepatic effects, infections, consequences of lymphopenia, macular oedema, 
malignancies and pulmonary effects. In the approved indication, the most commonly reported adverse 
reactions are nasopharyngitis (11%), alanine aminotransferase increased (5%), and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase increased (5%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related 
to liver enzyme elevations (1.1%). 
Three data pools form the basis of the clinical safety analysis in the ozanimod Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies. The pools are labelled in sequence to the existing pools included in the previous ozanimod MS 
submission. The UC pool designations are F (UC controlled studies) and G (UC controlled and open-label 
studies). 
The focus of this safety overview is the pooled placebo-controlled Induction Periods from the Phase 2 
study and Phase 3 Cohort 1 (Pool F Induction) and the randomized withdrawal Maintenance Period from 
the Phase 3 study (3101 MP). Pool G includes the placebo-controlled induction studies from Pool F, the 
Phase 2 Maintenance and Open-label Periods, the 3101 MP, the open-label induction Cohort 2 from 
RPC01-3101, and the OLE study (RPC01-3102), providing an assessment of the long-term safety of 
ozanimod 1 mg in UC subjects. Pool D (all completed and ongoing open-label studies in UC, Crohn’s

disease [CD], and MS) comprises the largest overall dataset and is used for the exploration of rare 
events.  
Data on subjects with CD in ongoing placebo-controlled trials were not provided in the pooled data since 
these data are blinded. 
Figure 41: Safety analysis pooling strategy (numbers of ozanimod-treated subjects) 
Pool F (controlled UC studies) comprises two subsets, i.e. 
Pool F-induction (referred to as Fi in this Report) compared the ozanimod 1 mg treatment groups of the 
induction periods from the UC studies with placebo groups of these periods, i.e. Phase 2 Study 202 (9-
week induction period) and Phase 3 Study 3101-Cohort 1 (10-week induction period).  
Pool F-maintenance (Fm in this Report) consists of the 42-week randomized withdrawal Maintenance 
Period from the Phase 3 Study 3101 (comprising Cohort 1 or Cohort 2 subjects, who had a clinical 
response to ozanimod 1 mg treatment during the Induction Period and were re-randomized to receive 
either ozanimod 1 mg or placebo as maintenance treatment).  
Pool G (controlled and uncontrolled UC studies) includes subjects receiving 1 mg ozanimod or placebo in 
Phase 2 Study 202 (placebo-controlled induction, maintenance and OLE part), Phase 3 Study 3101 
(including placebo-controlled induction (cohort 1), open-label induction (cohort 2), maintenance period) 
and OLE Study 3102, providing an assessment of the long-term safety of ozanimod 1 mg in UC subjects. 
Pool D (all controlled and uncontrolled UC, CD, and MS studies) comprises the largest dataset, useful for 
evaluation of rare events that are not related to background disease (including UC-Studies 202, 3101, 
3102; CD-Studies 2201 and 3204 and MS-Studies 201A, 201B, 301, 3001, and PD Study 1001). 
Analyses were based on the treatment group to which a subject was assigned when the event occurred.  
Patient exposure 
A total of 4057 subjects were exposed to ozanimod 1 mg across all patient studies (Pool D), including 3252 
subjects  (80.2%)  exposed  for  ≥  12  months  and  2694  subjects  (66.4%)  exposed  for  ≥  24  months.  Total 
cumulative exposure to ozanimod 1 mg was more than 11,600 subject-years (SY). 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021

A total of 1158 subjects with UC have been exposed to ozanimod 1 mg (Pool G), including 868 subjects 
exposed for ≥ 6 months, 716 subjects exposed for ≥ 12 months, and 322 subjects exposed for ≥ 24 months. 
In Pool G, the mean exposure to ozanimod 1 mg was approximately 19 months, with a total cumulative 
exposure of approximately 1842 SY. 
The mean duration of exposure in Pool F during the Induction Period was approximately 10 weeks in both 
the  ozanimod  1  mg  and  placebo  treatment  groups.  In  the  RPC01  3101  Maintenance  Period,  the  mean 
duration of exposure was longer for the 230 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg group than 
for the 227 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – placebo group (~38 weeks versus ~31 weeks, respectively). 
Table 83: Extent of exposure – Pool G (Safety Population) 
Demographics and baseline characteristics in Pool Fi were balanced across treatment groups. The 
median age was approximately 40 years with a minimum age of 18 and a maximum age of 74 years and 
approx. 60% of subjects were male. The vast majority was White and nearly 30% of the Fi population 
was from Eastern Europe. Baseline demographics of subjects from Pool Fm and G were generally 
consistent with Pool Fi.  
Subjects were to be excluded from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 UC studies if they had a history of clinically 
relevant cardiac, hepatic, neurological, pulmonary, ophthalmological, endocrine, psychiatric, or other 
major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol problematic, interpretation of the trial 
difficult, or that would put the subject at risk by participating in the trial. 
Similar patterns of concomitant medication use were observed for Pool Fi, Fm and G. In Pool F1 intestinal 
anti-inflammatory/anti-infective agents were used by 91.5% of subjects (primarily mesalazine [70.8%], 
sulfasalazine [15.9%], and budesonide [3.8%]), 29.4% subjects used systemic corticosteroids (primarily 
prednisone [15.9%]).

Adverse events 
TEAEs and marked laboratory abnormalities were summarized by subject incidence defined as the 
number of subjects with the specific event divided by the number of subjects included in the analysis. 
Exposure-adjusted incidence rates: The IR per 1000 subject-years was calculated as the number of 
subjects / subject years on study x 1000 for the specific system organ class (SOC) category or preferred 
term (PT) subcategory.

The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo treatment groups. 
The incidence of severe TEAEs, serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug, 
and TEAEs leading to study withdrawal were low (< 4%) and similar between the 2 treatment groups.

Pool Fm Placebo-controlled Maintenance Period (RPC01-3101) 
Overall, 49.1% of subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 36.6% of 
subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg - placebo treatment group reported at least 1 TEAE (Table 16). The 
incidences of severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to temporary interruption of study drug were generally 
similar between the treatment groups. Serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to permanent study drug 
discontinuation occurred more frequently in subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg – placebo (7.9% and 
2.6%) than subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg (5.2% and 1.3%) due to the TEAE of 
ulcerative colitis (worsening or exacerbation).

Note: At each level of subject summarization, a subject is counted only once if the subject reported multiple events. 
Note: A TEAE is defined as any AE with date of first onset or date of worsening in severity after the date of first MP 
dose, excluding those with onset after the 90-day safety follow-up visit. Subjects with multiple events reported for the 
same summary level will be counted only once. Percentages are based upon the number of subjects in the Safety 
Population. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs with ozanimod 1 mg (≥ 2% of subjects) which occurred at a ≥ 1% 
higher incidence compared with placebo were generally consistent with the known safety profile of 
ozanimod or common in patients with UC and included nasopharyngitis, nausea, pyrexia, arthralgia, and 
ALT increased (Table 17). Anemia was also reported at a > 2% incidence in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment 
group (3.6%) but was less frequent than with placebo (5.7%). 
Of note, there was a higher incidence of TEAEs of ulcerative colitis (worsening/flare) in the placebo 
treatment group than in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group (2.8% versus 1.6%, respectively). 
Table below lists the most frequently reported TEAEs with ozanimod 1 mg (≥ 2% of subjects), which

Pool Fm Placebo-controlled Maintenance Period (RPC01-3101) 
The overall pattern of TEAEs in Pool Fm was generally similar to Pool Fi. 
There were 6 subjects with peripheral edema in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group; 
the majority of peripheral edema TEAEs were mild, did not require intervention, and occurred in subjects 
with a medical history of peripheral edema. 
Of note, the incidence of ulcerative colitis (worsening/flare) was lower in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 
1 mg treatment group (0.4%) than the ozanimod 1 mg – placebo treatment group (4.4%). 
Frequent TEAEs by SOC/PT  
Pool Fi (Placebo-controlled induction period) 
The SOCs with the highest proportions of subjects reporting TEAEs were Infections and Infestations, 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions. In Pool Fi, the only 
SOC with ≥ 5% incidence of TEAEs reported by the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and with a ≥ 2% 
higher incidence compared to the placebo treatment group was the Investigations SOC. This was driven 
by increases in hepatic transaminases, including ALT, AST, and GGT increased, which were reported more 
frequently in the ozanimod treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (2.4% vs. 0%, 
1.2% vs. 0%, and 1.2% vs. 0%, respectively).

Note: A TEAE is defined as any AE with date of first onset or date of worsening in severity after the date of first MP 
dose, excluding those with onset after the 90-day safety follow-up visit. Percentages are based upon the number of 
subjects in the Safety Population. TEAEs are sorted by descending frequency in the RPC1063 1 mg - RPC1063 1 mg

Note: Subjects are counted at most once per preferred term for multiple occurrences. 
Logical grouping of AEs 
As part of signal detection to ascertain the true frequency of events that would otherwise be “split” 
between similar PTs, additional analyses were performed on the Pool F data using logical groupings of 
PTs. A total of 13 logical groupings of adverse events was performed (abdominal pain, anaemia, 
dysuria/urinary tract infection, elevated hepatic transaminase, gastroenteritis, headache, herpes simplex 
infection, hypertension, peripheral oedema, rash, respiratory symptoms, upper respiratory infection and 
visual impairment).  
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 165/209 
 
 
 
 
 
Relevant findings: in line with the known safety profile, a consistent imbalance across periods was 
observed in the logical grouping of elevated hepatic transaminase in Pool Fi as well as Fm. Imbalances 
were observed in one period but not in the other period for the logical groups of hypertension (higher 
incidence in ozanimod-treated subjects in Pool Fi (1.2% vs. 0%) and the same incidence in Pool Fm 
(2.2% in both groups)), herpes simplex infection (higher incidence in ozanimod-treated subjects in Pool 
Fm (1.7% vs. 0%), but not in Pool Fm (0.2% vs. 0%)). Grouping of anaemia resulted in a lower incidence 
in ozanimod-treated subjects in Pool Fi (4.0% vs 6.4%) and the same incidence in Pool Fm (2.6%)). 
According to the Applicant, mild imbalances of unclear significance were observed for logical groupings of 
the PTs abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, headache, peripheral oedema, and upper respiratory infection. 
The majority of these cases were nonserious and did not lead to study drug discontinuation and/or study 
withdrawal. Further, according to the Applicant for the majority of subjects, the grouped TEAEs of 
headache as well as peripheral oedema were mild in intensity and resolved on treatment in Pool Fi and 
Fm.  
Analysis of the most frequently reported AEs by Severity 
In Pool Fi, the incidence of severe TEAEs was low and similar between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo 
treatment groups (3.0% versus 2.1%, respectively). Ulcerative colitis (worsening/flare), headache, and 
anemia were the only severe TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject in any treatment group. Similarly 
findings resulted from Pool Fm (with 3.9% versus 4.0% severe TEAEs in the ozanimod/ozanimod and 
ozanimod/placebo group, respectively).  There were no severe TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject in 
the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg treatment group. 
Long term use (Pool G) 
The most frequently reported TEAEs with long-term use of ozanimod 1 mg (≥ 5% of subjects) which 
occurred at a ≥ 1% higher incidence compared with placebo were consistent with the known safety profile 
of ozanimod and included lymphopenia, nasopharyngitis, anemia, ALT increased, lymphocyte count 
decreased, headache, arthralgia, and upper respiratory tract infection (Table 85). Accounting for the 
difference in exposure between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo group (1922.5 versus 249.2 SY, 
respectively), the incidence rates (IR) of anemia, arthralgia, and upper respiratory tract infection were 
lower in subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg compared to placebo. 
Overall, there is no evidence of new patterns of TEAEs, increased incidence of TEAEs, or unique TEAEs 
with longer exposure to ozanimod.

is calculated based on the date the subject first has a TEAE within the subcategory (date of first TEAE - first dose date 
of study drug + 1)/365.25; for subjects who don't have a TEAE in the subcategory, the time on study is the study 
duration (last date on study - first dose date of study drug +1)/365.25. 
Note: Pool G includes subjects in Studies RPC01-202, RPC01-3101, and the open-label extension study, RPC01-3102. 
Analysis is based on the treatment group to which a subject was assigned when the event occurred, including subjects 
who were rerandomized to placebo. Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events are sorted by System Organ Class in 
internationally agreed order, then within preferred term by descending percentage in the ozanimod 1 mg column and 
then alphabetically by preferred term. Subjects are counted at most once per preferred term for multiple occurrences. 
As only the induction part of phase II study 202 is included in the controlled UC Pool (Fi), but the 
maintenance part was only included in uncontrolled UC Pool G, the safety results derived from controlled 
maintenance part of Study 202 are shortly summarized below: 
During the Maintenance Period a higher proportion of placebo patients experienced at least one AE 
(32.0%), a least one moderate or severe AE (16.0%), at least one serious AE (8.0%), and at least one 
AE leading to withdrawal (12.0%) compared to the combined ozanimod treatment groups (19.2%, 7.7%, 
1.3%, and 0%, respectively). There were no serious AEs assessed as related to study drug and no deaths 
occurred in the Maintenance Period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 167/209 
 
 
 
 
Only ulcerative colitis and urinary tract infection occurred in more than one patient in the Maintenance 
Period and there were no notable differences in incidence of these AEs between treatment groups. 
Two related AEs were reported during the Maintenance Period, both in the ozanimod 1 mg group (1 
abdominal pain, 1 leukopenia). No AE of special interest occurred during the maintenance period in either 
treatment group. There were no deaths in the trial. During the Maintenance Period, 3 SAEs in 2 placebo 
subjects occurred and 1 SAE in the ozanimod 1 mg, reported as colon adenoma and not (at least 
possibly) related.  
The long-term adverse effects seen with ozanimod in subjects with UC was also examined comparing the 
incidence and study duration-adjusted incidence rate (IR) per 1000 subject years (SY) of TEAEs in 
subjects treated with ozanimod in the Pools Fi and Fm with data from Pool G with longer term exposure to 
ozanimod for up to approx. 82 months. No increase in overall rates of TEAEs or specific types of TEAEs 
were observed. No TEAEs indicative of a long-term cumulative toxicity were observed. 
Definition of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in the product information  
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were selected based on: 
• 
• 
the incidence of reports (≥ 2% overall and ≥ 1% higher than placebo during induction or 
maintenance in the Phase 3 study, or in the pooled induction period),  
in consideration of AEs reported in the placebo-controlled Phase 1 and 2 studies, and 
•  medical assessment (including a causality determination by use of the Bradford-Hill criteria and in 
consideration of the mechanism of action of ozanimod and possible class effects). 
Each ADR is categorized by frequency (i.e., very common, common, uncommon, or rare) based on the 
subject incidence reported in the ozanimod 1 mg group in the MS or UC studies, whichever was higher.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)/ Sponsor-designated events of interest (SDEI): 
In UC studies 3101 and 202, subjects were closely monitored for AEs relating to cardiac abnormalities, 
hepatic abnormalities, ophthalmic abnormalities (study 202)/ macular oedema (study 3101), 
malignancies, pulmonary function, infections, and lymphopenia (study 3101 only). 
The Applicant has further provided analyses of SDEI, a retrospective, systematic, and broadly inclusive 
approach to the review of key safety categories expanding on the concept of AESIs. SDEI are safety 
event categories that were selected based on potential safety concerns related to the biological effects of 
S1P1 modulation.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In Pool Fi the incidence of SAEs was low and similar between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo treatment 
groups (3.8% versus 3.9%, respectively). An imbalance was observed in the incidence of SAEs of 
anaemia, which occurred in 4 subjects (0.8%) in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and none on 
placebo. All 4 subjects had evidence of anaemia at baseline laboratory testing. In all cases, the 
investigator and the sponsor deemed the event not related to study drug. Overall, laboratory data have 
not revealed any evidence of a drug effect of ozanimod on haemoglobin and haematocrit, as shifts in 
these parameters from normal to low were more frequent with placebo. 
Serious ulcerative colitis (worsening/ flare) was the only other SAE that occurred in more than 2 subjects 
in either treatment group and had a similar incidence between ozanimod 1 mg (8 subjects, 1.6%) and 
placebo (6 subjects, 2.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 168/209 
 
 
 
 
In Pool Fm the incidence of SAEs was slightly lower in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment 
group than in the ozanimod 1 mg – placebo treatment group (5.2% versus 7.9%). SAEs of ulcerative 
colitis (worsening/ flare) occurred predominantly in subjects who were re-randomized to placebo (4.0% 
versus 0.4% for ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg), and complicated appendicitis (0.9% versus 0), also 
occurred in subjects re-randomized to placebo. No other SAEs were reported in more than two subjects. 
Long-term Use in UC (Pool G): Overall, serious TEAEs were infrequent across the UC program (151/1158 
[13.0%] with ozanimod 1 mg versus 35/508 [6.9%] with placebo). Most SAEs were reported in only 1 
subject. The most frequently reported serious TEAE in the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo treatment groups 
was ulcerative colitis (worsening/ flare), which occurred in 44 (3.8%) and 17 (3.3%) of subjects in the 
ozanimod 1 mg and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Other most common SAEs included anaemia, 
appendicitis, ischemic stroke, pneumonia, haemolytic anaemia, and abdominal pain.  
Accounting for the difference in exposure between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo group (1922.5 versus 
249.2 SY, respectively), the IR of ulcerative colitis (worsening/ flare) was lower with ozanimod 1 mg than 
placebo (23.2 versus 68.8). 
Deaths 
There  were  14  subject  deaths  in  the  entire  ozanimod  clinical  development  program  as  of  31  Mar  2020, 
including 10 deaths in the MS program, 3 deaths in the UC program, and 1 death in the CD program. Seven 
deaths were previously described in the MS SCS including 5 subjects with MS), 1 subject with UC, and 1 
subject with CD. The remaining 7 deaths are described below including 2 deaths in the UC program and 5 
deaths in the MS program. In addition, the UC subject included in the MS SCS is described below. 
Death During the Phase 3 UC Study (RPC01-3101 Open-label Induction Cohort 2) 
• 
Subject  XX  was  a  64-year-old  male  subject  with  UC  and  a  medical  history  of  ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, right bundle branch block, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prolonged tobacco use 
(over 40 years), and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and received prior treatment with mesalamine. The subject 
was  administered  ozanimod  1  mg  for  approximately  6  weeks  in  Study  RPC01-3101  and  terminated  the 
study early on Study Day 43 (Early Termination Visit) due to severe fatigue and overall poor health. On 
Study  Day  45,  the  subject  was  hospitalized  for  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  and  pneumonia 
influenzal  and  subsequently  died  on  Study  Day  59.  Both  events  were  fatal  and  were  considered  to  be 
unrelated to study drug by the investigator. The Sponsor considered the events not suspected to be related 
to study drug. The death occurred during a regional outbreak of influenza. 
Death During the UC OLE (RPC01-3102 OLE) 
• 
Subject XY (RPC01-3101 ozanimod 1 mg/ozanimod 1 mg group) was a 57-year-old male with a 
past history of myocarditis and hypertension who had an unwitnessed sudden death event on Day 184 of 
the  OLE  study.  Concomitant  medications  during  the  OLE  included  lisinopril,  carvedilol,  mesalazine,  and 
pregabalin. The subject’s last recorded BP on Day 145 of the OLE was within normal range (116/74 mm 
Hg) and similar to the baseline value (117/68 mm Hg). The ECG on Day 1 of the OLE showed sinus rhythm, 
atrial  premature  complexes,  and  intraventricular  conduction  delay  (nonspecific);  normal  T  wave 
morphology was noted. On Day 173 of the OLE, an echocardiogram revealed a mildly dilated left ventricle, 
mildly reduced global systolic function, ejection fraction 49%, normal wall thickness, impaired relaxation, 
normal right ventricular size and function, mildly dilated left atrium, borderline enlarged right atrium, mitral 
valve  prolapse  with  mild  mitral  regurgitation,  trace  tricuspid  regurgitation,  normal  pulmonary  artery 
pressure, no aortic valve abnormality, normal aorta, and normal pericardium. On Day 184 of the OLE, it 
was  reported  that  the  subject  had  been  found  lying  in  the  street,  unresponsive,  and  was  pronounced 
deceased upon arrival at the medical facility. The cause of the death event was unknown. No autopsy was 
performed.  The  subject  had  been  treated  with  ozanimod  for  a  total  of  approximately  19  months  in  the

parent study and extension study. The investigator considered the relationship of the event to the study 
drug unlikely. The Sponsor considered the relationship of the event to study drug unrelated. 
Deaths During the RMS OLE (RPC01-3001) 
• 
Subject XZ was a 22-year-old female subject with RMS who received ozanimod 0.5 mg per day for 
729 days and placebo IM injection weekly for 723 days in Study RPC01-201B. The subject entered Study 
RPC01-3001 OLE and received 837 days of treatment with ozanimod 1 mg. The subject died due to road 
traffic accident on Study Day 838; the subject was hit by a car with an intoxicated driver while driving a 
motorbike. The last dose of ozanimod was administered on Study Day 837. The investigator considered the 
event unrelated to study drug. The Sponsor considered the event not related to study drug. 
Death During the Phase 2 UC OLP (RPC01-202) already described during authorisation procedure of 
ozanimod: 
• 
Subject  XXX  was  a  43-year-old  female  subject  with  UC  who  received  ozanimod  0.5  mg  for 
approximately 32 weeks in Study RPC01-202 and ozanimod 1 mg for approximately 863 days in RP01-202 
OLP, discontinued study drug due to adenocarcinoma. On study ALC levels were < 0.5 x 109/L on Study 
Day 830. The subject died in the hospital from mucinous adenocarcinoma (of gastric, pancreatic, bilial, or 
endometrial [intestinal type] origin) on open-label extension Study Day 911. The event was considered to 
be possibly related to study drug by the investigator. The Sponsor considered the event to be unrelated to 
study drug. 
Deaths during the RMS OLE (RPC01-3001) 
• 
Subject XXY (22-year-old, female subject with RMS, received ozanimod 0.5 mg per day) was hit 
by a car with an intoxicated driver while driving a motorbike. The investigator considered the event 
unrelated to study drug. The Sponsor considered the event not related to study drug. 
• 
Subject XXZ was a 48-year-old female subject with RMS who received 729 days of treatment with 
placebo and 722 days with interferon (IFN) β-1a 30 µg weekly in Study RPC01-201B. The subject entered 
the RPC01-3001 OLE and received 512 days of treatment with ozanimod 1 mg per day. On Study Day 506, 
the  subject  was  hospitalized  with  neoplasm  malignant  (unknown  primary  focus).  C  reactive  protein  was 
increased.  An  MRI  of  the  head  performed  on  Day  510  showed  a  metastatic  tumor  in  the  area  of  the 
cerebellum. A computed tomography (CT) scan done on Study Day 512 showed numerous tumors in the 
lung,  liver,  adrenal  gland,  and  peritoneum.  The  subject  subsequently  experienced  severe  events  of 
pneumonia  and  epilepsy  and  died  on  Study  Day  531  due  to  the  neoplasm  malignant.  The  investigator 
considered the event possibly related to study medication. The Sponsor considered the event unrelated to 
study medication. 
• 
Subject XXXX was a 46-year old female subject with RMS who received 171 days with ozanimod 1 
mg per day in Study RPC01-201A and continued in the RPC01-201A Blinded Extension and received 753 
days with ozanimod 1 mg per day. The subject subsequently enrolled in Study RPC01-3001 and received 
977 days of ozanimod 1 mg in this study. The total treatment duration was 1901 days. The subject was 
hospitalized  on  Study  Day  977  due  to  severe  pneumonia  and  died  on  Study  Day  988.  The  investigator 
considered the event possibly related to study medication. The Sponsor considered the event unrelated to 
study medication.

died due to glioblastoma multiforme on Study Day 1508. The investigator considered the event unrelated 
to study medication. The Sponsor considered the event not related to study medication. 
• 
Subject XXXZ was a 42-year-old female subject with RMS who received 728 days with placebo oral 
capsule and 722 days with IFN β-1a 30 µg weekly. The subject entered RPC01-3001 OLE and received 1199 
days  of  treatment  with ozanimod  1  mg.  On  Study Day  1200,  the  subject  was  hospitalized  with  cerebral 
hemorrhage  after  being  found  unconscious  on  a  sidewalk.  The  event  was  fatal  despite  attempts  of 
resuscitation.  Comorbidities  included  stage  2  arterial  hypertension,  MS  progression,  impaired  glycemia, 
cytolysis  syndrome,  and  acute  renal impairment.  The  subject  died  on  Study  Day  1205.  The  investigator 
considered the event unrelated to study medication. The Sponsor considered the event not related to study 
medication. 
Cardiac Effects 
The S1P1 receptor is highly expressed in atrial, septal, and ventricular cardiomyocytes, in the endothelial 
cells of cardiac vessels, and in other endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, where it contributes to 
the regulation of endothelial barrier function and peripheral vascular tone. After initial agonism, 
continuous dosing results in functional antagonism and down-regulation of S1P activity due to S1P1 
internalization. Activation of S1P receptors on cardiac cells provides an explanation for the transient 
effects on heart rate (bradycardia) and atrioventricular conduction, while modulation of the receptor on 
vascular smooth muscle cells could lead to vasoconstriction causing a mild increase in blood pressure. 
The UC clinical studies excluded subjects who in the last 6 months experienced myocardial infarction, or 
who had unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, decompensated heart failure requiring 
hospitalization, Class III/IV heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, or severe untreated sleep apnea. Subjects 
with prolonged QTcF (> 450 msec for males, > 470 msec for females) or who were at additional risk for 
QT interval prolongation, as well as subjects with a resting heart rate < 55 bpm, were also excluded. 
Effects on heart rate (HR) during treatment initiation: 
Initiation of ozanimod may cause a transient reduction in heart rate. Based on Phase 1 data and in line 
with the MS clinical studies, a dose-escalation approach was implemented in the ozanimod UC Phase 2 
and 3 clinical development programs to mitigate potential first dose cardiac effects.  
In the placebo-controlled UC Phase 2 study 202, a complete 24 hours of Holter monitoring has been 
performed on Day 1 (and up to amendment of the study protocol in a subset of subjects also on Day 5 
and 8, respectively). No symptomatic bradycardia occurred. On Day 1, minimum hourly HRs between 40 
and 44 bpm were recorded for 5 (4.0%) ozanimod-treated subjects (versus no placebo subjects) during 
the normal diurnal reduction in HR observed during sleep.  
In addition, as described in RPC01-202 CSR Erratum 2, 3 ozanimod-treated subjects had minimal HR 
values of < 45 bpm on Day 1, all of which occurred overnight and none of which were associated with an 
adverse event or required treatment. In one of these latter subjects (503-2001), a minimal heart rate of 
38 bpm occurred at 2 AM; the subject’s heart rate during the first 6 hours after dosing was ≥ 64 bpm.  
HR in the other 2 subjects were above 40 bpm. According to the Summary of clinical safety, no other 
minimum HR < 40 bpm were recorded in this study (also not within the first 6 hours after treatment). 
With Holter monitoring on Days 5 and 8, there were no subjects in any treatment group with a minimum 
HR < 45 bpm. In general, the daily minimum hourly HRs were recorded at night (while most subjects 
were asleep) in all treatment groups. 
In the 496 subjects treated with ozanimod in Pool Fi, initiation of ozanimod 0.25 mg resulted in a 
modest and clinically uneventful reduction in HR on Day 1 (mean HR reduction from baseline of 0.7 bpm 
with a nadir at Hour 5, with return towards baseline by Hour 6 with a mean HR reduction of 0.4 bpm), 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 171/209 
 
 
 
 
which is consistent with the corresponding reduction from baseline in HR of 1.2 bpm in the active-
controlled Phase 3 MS studies.  
In the Phase 3 UC study, there were 2 subjects who experienced TEAE of bradycardia on Day 1 of 
dosing. One subject of the blinded cohort 1 with onset of bradycardia within 6 hours of fist dose and 
lowest documented HR of 45 bpm at Hour 8 and one subject of open-label cohort 2 with lowest HR at 
Hour 2 of 43 bpm. This latter case was symptomatic (headache, nausea, and lightheadedness), however, 
for both subjects, no treatment for bradycardia was required and no action was taken for study drug for 
the adverse events 
There was 1 subject with HR < 45 bpm on Day 1 (asymptomatic HR 42 bpm at Hour 3, which increased 
to 47 bpm at Hours 5 and 6 and was not reported as a TEAE). Importantly, within all the UC studies, 
there were no occurrences of second-degree type 2 or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Ozanimod 
did not significantly affect cardiac repolarization or HR. The applicant concludes that totality of cardiac 
monitoring data supports the approved MS prescribing information, including monitoring restricted to 
patients with specific pre-existing cardiac conditions. 
Subjects with Extended Monitoring (Pool Fi) 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in HR and no reports of second-degree type 2 or third-
degree AV block during chronic treatment with ozanimod 1 mg. Furthermore, there were no TEAEs of 
bradycardia in the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period. 
4.2% of subjects in the ozanimod treatment group and 2.1% of subjects in the placebo treatment group 
underwent protocol-mandated extended monitoring. The most common reason for extended monitoring 
was the lowest post-dose HR occurring at Hour 6. None of the subjects who received extended monitoring 
had symptomatic bradycardia. 
HR during chronic therapy: In Pool Fi, by week 5, the next vital sign assessment after the Day 1 
assessments, the mean sitting/supine HR returned towards and exceeded the baseline values in both 
treatment groups and generally remained stable up to Week 10. 
Cardiac conduction effects/ECG results: 
Study 202: Seven subjects were identified with cardiac findings of second-degree AV block type 1 or 
sinus pause occurring during 24-hour Holter monitoring on Day 1 (RPC01-202 CSR Erratum 2). Of these 7 
subjects, 4 had received ozanimod 0.25 mg and 3 had received placebo. Of the 4 ozanimod-treated 
subjects, 3 subjects had minimal HR values of < 45 bpm on Day 1, all of which occurred overnight, 
described in the context of HR reduction, directly above. None of these Holter findings were associated 
with an TEAE or required treatment. 
In addition, 3 ozanimod treated subjects had second-degree AV block type 1 (n = 2) or sinus pause (n = 
1) occurring during 24-hour Holter monitoring on Day 1 of the OL period. All of these subjects had 
received placebo during the core period. For these 3 subjects, no TEAEs were reported on the day of the 
events and no action was taken with study drug. The follow-up ECG at Week 10 of the OL period 
demonstrated that the events of second-degree AV block type 1 have resolved.  
During chronic therapy, 1 subject in Pool F1 had a second-degree AV block type 1 at week 10. Prior to 
treatment the subject had first-degree AV block; an ECG four months later showed normal sinus rhythm 
without AV block with continued treatment.  
Shift analyses of day 1 ECG findings from Pool F1 did not reveal any new safety findings.

Blood Pressure during chronic therapy: 
 In Pool Fi, mean systolic blood pressure increased by 3.7 mm Hg with ozanimod and by 2.3 mm Hg with 
placebo at week 10 compared to baseline and mean diastolic blood pressure increased by 2.3 mm HG 
with ozanimod and 0.6 mm Hg with placebo. In Pool Fm, mean increase in systolic blood pressure was 
5.1 mm Hg in the ozanimod-ozanimod group and 2.3 mm Hg in the placebo-ozanimod group at week 52 
compared to baseline and mean increase in diastolic blood pressure was 2.2 mm Hg in the ozanimod-
ozanimod group and 0.8 mm Hg in the placebo-ozanimod group at week 52. In Pool G, increases in 
systolic blood pressure remained rather stable from week 20 to 48. These results are consistent with BP 
changes observed at Month 24 for the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group in the MS Phase 3 studies, where 
there was a mean increase from baseline of 5.2 mm Hg in SBP and of 2.3 mm Hg in DBP. 
The incidence of hypertension TEAEs (as per logical grouping) was low and slightly higher in the ozanimod 
1 mg treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group during the Pool F Induction Period 
(1.2% versus 0%) and similar during the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period (2.2% and 2.2%). In Pool G, 
hypertensive crisis was reported by 2 subjects on ozanimod and 1 subject on placebo; all subjects had a 
history of hypertension, recovered without clinical sequelae, and continued with study drug after the 
event. These data from the ozanimod UC development program are consistent with those described in the 
MS program, where hypertension TEAEs in the 2 active-controlled Phase 3 MS studies occurred in 3.4% of 
subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg.  
Collectively, as it was for MS, the cardiac experience at initiation in the UC studies indicates that dose 
escalation of ozanimod over 1 week mitigates the S1P1 receptor-mediated HR reduction (chronotropic) 
and conduction (dromotropic) effects, supporting monitoring restricted to patients with specific pre-
existing cardiac conditions. These results in UC are generally consistent with findings in MS.. 
Cardiac related TEAEs: 
Cardiac TEAEs during treatment initiation 
In Pool Fi on Day 1, there was 1 TEAE from the Cardiac Disorders SOC in each treatment group (1 
subject [0.2%] in the Cohort 1 ozanimod treatment group experienced bradycardia and 1 subject [0.4%] 
in the placebo treatment group experienced ventricular extrasystoles) and 1 TEAE from the Vascular 
Disorders SOC in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group (hypertensive crisis, non-serious, in a subject with 
ongoing hypertension and no documented treatment with antihypertensives, considered not related). 
Cardiac TEAEs during Days 1 to 30 
In Pool Fi during Days 1 to 30, the incidence of TEAEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC was low and similar 
between the ozanimod 1 mg (0.8%) and placebo treatment groups (1.1%). Four subjects (0.8%) in the 
ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and no subject in the placebo treatment group reported TEAEs in the 
Vascular Disorders SOC during Days 1 to 30; the only TEAE reported by more than 1 subject was hot 
flush (reported by 2 subjects [0.4%]).  
In Pool Fi, two subjects (0.4%) in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group reported bradycardia, 1 
occurred on Day 1 during treatment initiation, also reported above) and 1 occurred on Day 2. In this 
latter case, the subject reported bradycardia, however no HR value was available and not treatment was 
given. No further TEAEs of bradycardia occurred in Pool Fi. 
In addition, one subject of open-label Cohort 2 of study 3101 experienced a TEAE of bradycardia at Day 1 
(described above) and 2 subjects of this Cohort reported bradycardia during the Induction Period beyond 
Day 1: In one subject, bradycardia (with HR ≥ 50 bpm) occurred on Day 10 on which the subject was 
started on bisopropol. In the second subject, bradycardia (HR of 45 bpm reported by subject as lowest 
value; subject further noted lightheadedness and headaches) was reported after 7 weeks of treatment. 4 
Days after ozanimod discontinuation at week 9 the bradycardia resolved without treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 173/209 
 
 
 
 
Cardiac TEAEs in Pool Fi (Up to Week 10) 
In Pool Fi, no imbalance was found with regard to TEAEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC (1.2% and 1.4% in 
ozanimod and placebo subjects, respectively). Apart from 2 TEAEs of bradycardia, which occurred at Day 
1 and 2, no further cases of bradycardia occurred in Pool Fi. TEAEs in the Vascular Disorders SOC were 
more frequently reported in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group compared with the placebo treatment 
group (2.0% vs. 0.4%, respectively); the difference was primarily driven by events of hypertension and 
hot flush both of which were observed in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group only (6 subjects [1.2%] 
and 2 subjects [0.4%], respectively).  
Cardiac TEAEs in Pool Fm (i.e. during Weeks 10 through 52 of 3101-Maintenance Period) 
In Pool Fm, there were 3 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and no 
subject in the ozanimod 1 mg - placebo treatment group with TEAEs in the Cardiac Disorders SOC. The 3 
subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg treatment group reported 4 TEAEs in the Cardiac 
Disorders SOC (arrhythmia, cardiac failure chronic, coronary artery disease, and pericarditis), all of which 
occurred > 60 days after the first dose. Of these TEAEs, cardiac failure chronic and coronary artery 
disease occurred concurrently in the same subject, and pericarditis was considered serious. There were 
no TEAEs of bradycardia in Pool Fm. 
There were 6 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 4 subjects in the 
ozanimod 1 mg - placebo treatment group who reported TEAEs in the Vascular Disorders SOC. The TEAEs 
of hypertension, which were reported by 4 and 3 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg and 
ozanimod 1 mg - placebo treatment groups, respectively, were generally reported at a consistent rate 
during the different exposure intervals. TEAEs of hypertensive crisis (1 in each treatment group) occurred 
> 60 days after the first dose in the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period.  
Cardiac TEAEs in Pool G (analysis during long-term treatment by 3 months intervals) 
No Cardiac Disorders or Vascular Disorders TEAEs indicative of a long-term cumulative toxicity were 
observed. TEAEs of hypertension were generally reported at a consistent rate during the different 
exposure intervals.  
TEAEs of Hypertension 
The incidence of hypertension TEAEs (as per logical grouping) was low and somewhat higher in the 
ozanimod 1 mg treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group in Pool Fi (1.2% vs. 0%) 
and similar in Pool Fm (2.2% and 2.2%). In Pool G, hypertensive crisis was reported by 2 subjects on 
ozanimod and 1 subject on placebo; all subjects had a history of hypertension, recovered without clinical 
sequelae, and continued with study drug after the event. The data from the ozanimod UC development 
program are consistent with the MS program, where hypertension TEAEs in the 2 active-controlled 
Phase 3 MS studies occurred in 3.4% of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg. 
Hepatic Effects 
Consistent with what has been observed with ozanimod and other S1P receptor modulators in MS, hepatic 
enzyme elevations, including ALT, AST, and GGT, were seen with ozanimod 1 mg treatment. Small 
increases in mean total bilirubin also occurred with ozanimod. When elevations in liver function tests 
occurred, they were generally asymptomatic and resolved with continued treatment and did not lead to 
severe drug-induced liver injury. 
The incidences of hepatic-related TEAEs were evaluated in the SOCs of Hepatobiliary Disorders and 
Investigations. The incidence of hepatic laboratory-related TEAEs (Investigations SOC) was higher with 
ozanimod 1 mg than placebo during the Pool F Induction Period (5.4% versus 2.8%) and the RPC01-3101 
Maintenance Period (11.3% versus 4.0%). However, the incidence of Hepatobiliary Disorders TEAEs (eg, 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 174/209 
 
 
 
 
hyperbilirubinemia, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) was low and similar between the ozanimod 1 mg and 
placebo treatment groups (0.2% versus 0.7% during the Pool F Induction Period and 0.9% versus 1.3% 
during the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period). Discontinuations due to hepatic-related TEAEs were only 
seen with ozanimod and were infrequent (2 subjects [0.4%] during the Pool F Induction Period and 1 
subject [0.4%] during the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period). 
Hepatic laboratory analyses: 
The incidences of hepatic-related laboratory TEAEs during induction period and maintenance period are 
presented in the following tables.

Table 90: Incidence of hepatic-related laboratory TEAEs Pool Fm (Safety Population) 
Elevations in ALT ≥ 3x ULN, ≥ 5x ULN, and ≥ 10x ULN were observed in 2.6%, 0.9%, and 0.5% of subjects 
treated with ozanimod 1 mg in the RPC01-3101 Induction Period (versus 0.5%, 0.5%, and 0% of 
subjects on placebo), and in 2.3%, 0.9%, and 0% of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg in the RPC01-
3101 Maintenance Period (versus none on placebo). Data from the ozanimod UC development program 
are consistent with the MS program, where elevations in ALT ≥ 3x ULN, ≥ 5x ULN, and ≥ 10x ULN occurred 
in 5.5%, 1.6%, and 0.5% of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg in the 2 active-controlled Phase 3 MS

studies for up to 2 years. The majority of subjects with a post-baseline ALT > 3x ULN (approx. 96% of 
subjects in the controlled and uncontrolled UC studies and 79% of subjects in the 2 active-controlled 
Phase 3 MS studies) continued treatment with ozanimod 1 mg with most values returning to ≤ 3x ULN 
within approx. 2 to 4 weeks. In the UC and MS clinical trials, ozanimod was discontinued for a confirmed 
elevation of ALT or AST > 5x ULN. Overall, the discontinuation rate due to elevations in hepatic enzymes 
was low (0.8% of subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg in the controlled and uncontrolled UC studies) and 
similar to the 2 active-controlled Phase 3 MS studies (1.1%). 
In the UC development program, there was 1 subject who had AST ≥ 3x ULN and bilirubin > 2x ULN. The 
subject had a specific concurrent disease/ alternative diagnosis (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia) that 
was responsible for the elevation in bilirubin and AST. The case therefore did not meet the criteria for 
Hy’s Law and was previously described for the MS indication.  
Subjects with elevations of ALT > 10x ULN (Pool G) 
A total of 5 subjects (0.4%) in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group had elevations of ALT > 10x ULN. Of 
these 5 subjects with ALT > 10x ULN, 1 subject had evidence of liver disease (compensated cirrhosis) at 
study entry, 1 subject had a history of and ongoing pancreatitis during the study with ALT above normal 
prior to study entry (ALT elevations resolved after discontinuation of study drug), 2 subjects had a history 
of elevation in hepatic enzymes prior to study entry (1 was associated with prior biologic therapy and the 
other was receiving ursodeoxycholic acid due to elevated liver enzymes of unknown origin), and 1 subject 
had an elevation in ALT following discontinuation of treatment with ozanimod and after taking oral 
nimesulide for the treatment of oligomenorrhea. None of the subjects progressed to severe liver injury. 
Hepatic events of potential clinical significance: 
An examination of the overall program hepatic safety, including laboratory changes and adverse events, 
was conducted to identify specific cases of potential clinical significance (including potential Hy’s law 
cases). 
Subjects with concurrent elevations of aminotransferase and bilirubin 
In the MS clinical development program, a total of 10 subjects had concurrent elevations of ALT or AST ≥ 
3x ULN and total bilirubin > 2x ULN. Of these 10 subjects, 1 was a UC subject, 1 was a CD subject, and 8 
were MS subjects. A review of unblinded cases by an external panel of hepatologist experts concluded 
that no case met Hy’s law due to alternate explanations and the pattern of abnormalities. As of the 31 
Mar 2020 safety cut-off date, no new cases of concurrent elevations of ALT or AST ≥ 3x ULN and total 
bilirubin > 2x ULN were reported.  
Drug-induced liver injury TEAEs 
In Pool G, there were 2 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group who reported a TEAE of drug-
induced liver injury: 
• One Subjec, a 60-year-old male, who received ozanimod 1 mg for 10 weeks in Study RPC01-3101 
(Induction Period) and was then re-randomized to placebo in the maintenance period, experienced an 
abnormal ALT of 98 U/L (reference ≤ 41 U/L) on Day 325 of Study RPC01-3102, followed by 43 U/L on 
Day 331. The elevation was considered mild but persistent. The Investigator deemed the event as drug-
induced liver injury, study drug was not stopped, and no treatment was given. The subject was 
discontinued from the study on Day 457 due to persistent mild elevation of ALT. The ALT value at the 
time of discontinuation was just above the ULN (44 U/L). The subject had no previous history of liver 
function abnormality at screening or during study. The subject neither had a relevant medical history nor 
did he receive concomitant medication.

• Subject XX, a 52-year-old female, who received ozanimod 1 mg for 10 weeks in the Study RPC01-3101 
Induction Period and was re-randomized to placebo in maintenance, experienced an abnormal ALT of 71 
U/L (reference ≤ 33 U/L) on Day 33 of Study RPC01-3102. The investigator deemed the event as drug-
induced liver injury. The elevation was considered mild but persistent; the highest ALT value recorded 
was 96 U/L on Day 111. The subject was prescribed ademetionine and no change was made to study 
drug. The subject stopped ademetionine after 60 days and subsequent ALT was 41 U/L on Day 154. The 
subject continued onto the open-label extension. The subject had no history of liver function abnormality 
at screening or during study. The subject had no relevant past medical history and was not on any 
contributing medication. 
Infections 
Reduction in circulating lymphocytes is a result of the mechanism of action of S1P receptor modulators 
but can potentially lead to increased susceptibility to infections, including serious and opportunistic 
infections. Subjects enrolled in the UC studies had to have documented positive varicella zoster virus 
(VZV) antibody status or complete VZV vaccination at least 30 days prior to randomization. 
Controlled UC studies: Duringinduction Period (Pool Fi), the incidence of infections was similar between 
the ozanimod 1 mg and the placebo treatment groups, with the most common infection being 
nasopharyngitis. In the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period, the incidence of nasopharyngitis (3.0% versus 
1.8%), herpes zoster (2.2% versus 0.4%), gastroenteritis (1.3% versus 0), and oral herpes (1.3% 
versus 0) was slightly higher in the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg treatment group than in the 
ozanimod 1 mg - placebo treatment group. No TEAE of infections led to discontinuation of study drug 
during either treatment period. 
Serious infections (infection-related SDEI)  
Controlled UC studies: The incidence of serious infections in Pool Fi was low in both treatment groups 
and numerically higher in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group compared with the placebo treatment 
group (0.8% versus 0.4%, respectively) with no specific pattern. All serious infections were reported in 
single subjects. The incidence of serious infections Pool Fm was low in all treatment groups and lower in 
the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg treatment group compared with the ozanimod 1 mg - placebo 
treatment group (0.9% versus 1.8%, respectively). In the ozanimod-ozanimod group, all serious 
infections were reported in single subjects only.  
In both controlled UC Pools (Fi and Fm), all serious infections resolved, mostly with no change in the 
study drug.  
Opportunistic infections (infection-related SDEI) 
In the Pool Fi, 3 (0.6%) subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and no subjects in the placebo 
treatment group had opportunistic infections SDEIs. These were campylobacter gastroenteritis in one and 
herpes zoster in two subjects, respectively. No opportunistic infections SDEIs were serious.  
In Pool Fm, there were 5 (2.2%) subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 1 (0.4%) subject 
in the placebo treatment group who had opportunistic infections SDEIs, all of whom had herpes zoster. 
No events of herpes zoster were serious, severe, or led to study drug withdrawal or study discontinuation. 
Pool G (all UC studies) 
Incidence and incidence rates (IR) of the most frequent (≥ 5%) infection TEAEs, serious and opportunistic 
infections, and infections leading to study drug withdrawal during long-term treatment in UC are given in

TEAEs, Serious Infections or Opportunistic Infections SDEIs, and Discontinuation of Study 
Drug Due to Infections and Infestations TEAEs in All UC Studies (Pool G) (Safety Population) 
Most cases of Herpes zoster with ozanimod in Pool G were mild to moderate (96%) and most subjects 
(88%) remained on study drug. Thirteen of the 25 (52.0%) subjects were > 50 years of age and at risk 
for herpes zoster reactivation. None of the subjects with herpes zoster had an ALC < 2x 109/L. 
Overall, there was no clear association between ALC < 0.2× 109/L and serious or opportunistic infections.

Pool D (all UC, CD and MS studies) 
As of data-cut off, there were no cases of PML or cryptococcal meningitis SDEIs in the ozanimod 
development program (Pool D). 
Macular Edema 
Macular edema was examined closely because of the effect of S1P receptor modulation on vascular 
endothelial cells. In the ozanimod UC program, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used as a 
standard screening tool to identify subjects for further ophthalmologic examination. The OCT was

evaluated in the placebo-controlled study, RPC01-3101, at baseline and at the end of the Induction 
(Week 10) and Maintenance Periods (Week 52), and in the open-label extension study RPC01-3102, at 
baseline, Week 10, Week 46, and annually thereafter. An OCT was also conducted at the end of Study 
RPC01-202 OLP. If an OCT abnormality was identified, or if visual signs or symptoms of ME observed, an 
ophthalmological examination was performed by an ophthalmologist (preferably a retina specialist), 
including eye history, visual acuity, and dilated ophthalmoscopy, to confirm the diagnosis of ME and/or to 
identify other ophthalmic abnormalities. No trend in macular thickness changes were noted over time with 
repeat OCTs with mild increases balanced across groups in Pool G. 
An assessment of ME was conducted by an expert panel (Macular Edema Review Panel [MERP]) who 
reviewed AEs of macular edema and AE preferred terms that could be associated with ME, as well as OCT 
findings potentially suggestive of ME (regardless of whether an ME-related AE was reported), and 
ophthalmic examinations. The MERP was comprised of 3 neuro-ophthalmologists and a retina specialist 
who were blinded to study treatment throughout all panel reviews (MERP Charter). 
Macular oedema was closely examined because of the effect of S1P receptor modulation on vascular 
endothelial cells. In the ozanimod UC program, optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used as a 
standard screening tool to identify subjects for further ophthalmologic examination. If an OCT 
abnormality was identified, or if visual signs or symptoms of ME observed, an ophthalmological 
examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. An assessment of potential cases of ME was 
conducted by an expert panel (Macular Edema Review Panel [MERP]). 
In Pool G, the incidence of ME TEAEs (preferred terms of macular oedema or cystoid macular oedema) in 
the UC studies was low. Five (0.4%) of the 1158 subjects had TEAEs of ME, all of whom were in the 
ozanimod 1 mg treatment group: 4 (0.3%) subjects had a TEAE of ME and 1 (< 0.1%) subject had a 
TEAE of cystoid macular oedema. All cases were reversible, and 3 cases resulted in discontinuation of 
study drug. There were 4 MERP-confirmed ME events in the ozanimod UC program, for an incidence of 
0.3% in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group. All confirmed cases were associated with pre-existing risk 
factors and/ or comorbid conditions that are known to be associated with ME. 
No trend in macular thickness changes were noted over time with repeat OCTs with mild increases 
balanced across groups in Pool G. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies were examined due to the potential effects of ozanimod as an immunomodulatory agent. 
Subjects with a history of malignancies (other than treated basal cell carcinoma and in situ squamous cell 
carcinomas of the skin or [in Phase 3 only] uterine cervix) were excluded from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 
UC studies. 
Controlled UC study parts: During the induction Period (Pool Fi), there was a single case of malignancy 
(cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma) in 1 subject (0.2%) in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group. Total 
time on study at time of diagnosis was 12 days. 
During the RPC01-3101 Maintenance Period (Pool Fm), the incidence of any malignancy was low and 
similar between the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg and the ozanimod 1 mg – placebo groups (2 
subjects [0.9%] in each treatment group). One subject (0.4%) in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg 
treatment group had basal cell carcinoma. 
The long-term incidence of malignancies was evaluated using Pool G, which comprises all UC studies 
and therefore provides a broader base of safety information in the UC population. Approximately 35% of 
subjects in Pool G had been previously treated with corticosteroids and approximately 13% of subjects 
had received prior immunosuppressants, including anti-TNFs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021

There were 14 malignancies reported in the UC program (Pool G), including 12 that occurred during 
ozanimod treatment and 2 that occurred after completing ozanimod induction and being rerandomized to 
the placebo group (Table 21). Malignancies were varied with no predominant type of malignancy and no 
malignancies suggestive of immunosuppression (ie, lymphoma).

a 
Total subject-years equals the sum of the number of years on study contributed by each subject from time of 
first dose per treatment group in the pool to last date on study per treatment group in the pool. The algorithm for the 
last date on study is dependent on subject disposition and whether subject enrolled into an extension study. If there is 
a duration gap between parent and extension study, the duration gap is counted.

IR per 1000 SY is calculated as number of subjects / SY × 1000 for specific SDEI category or subcategory. For 
a subject in a particular category/subcategory, the time on study is calculated based on the date the subject first 
meets an SDEI criterion within the category/subcategory per treatment group in the pool (date first criterion is 
met - first dose date of study drug per treatment group in the pool + 1)/365.25; for subjects who don't meet an SDEI 
criterion in the category/subcategory per treatment group in the pool, the time on study is the study duration per

Summary of background information and discussion provided by the Applicant (in the CO and SCS, 
respectively): 
The IR for all malignancies in Pool G (6.3 per 1000 SY) was similar to the background IR per 1000 PY of 
any malignancies in patients with IBD, estimated at 7.856 (95% CI: 7.54, 8.185) in the province of 
Quebec in the period 1998 to 2015 (Loo, 2019).  
The literature is generally in agreement that the risk for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) in 
patients with IBD exceeds that of the general population by at least 3- to 5-fold, increasing with duration 
and extent of disease (Eaden, 2004). The cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with UC 
has been estimated as 2% at 10 years, 8% at 20 years, and 18% at 30 years (Eaden, 2001). In the 
HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRDSM), the annual time adjusted IR per 1000 PY for colon 
cancer is 2.07 among patients with moderate to severe IBD (McAuliffe, 2015). There were 3 cases of CRC 
across the UC program involving 1666 subjects (0.2%); given an observation patient-time of 2000 PY, 
the incidence of CRC in the UC program is consistent with published data and contemporaneous rates in a 
US population of IBD patients. All 3 subjects had a relatively long duration of disease (10 to 18 years 
since diagnosis at screening), and 2 had extensive disease and prior use of azathioprine. Duration and 
extent of disease, as well as immunomodulator use, have been identified as risk factors for CRC among 
UC patients (Garg, 2016; Manninen, 2013). Given the increased risk, these subjects were closely followed 
by the Sponsor and rereviewed with the central reader and an external gastroenterologist consultant. In 
all 3 cases, the baseline endoscopy was found in retrospect to have evidence to suggest that the 
malignancy may have been present at baseline. 
The incidence and IR per 1000 SY of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) for ozanimod were also in the 
expected range of the general population. In Pool G, the incidence of NMSC was 0.5%; the IR per 1000 
SY for basal cell carcinoma was 2.6 and for squamous cell carcinoma was 0.5. In Minnesota, the age and 
sex-adjusted (US 2010 population) IR per 1000 PY of NMSC was 4.84 over the period 2000 to 2010 
(Muzic, 2017). In Germany, the crude IR per 1000 PY of NMSC in 2012 was 2.78 and 2.41 in men and 
women, respectively, in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein and 1.86 and 1.63 in men and women,  
The malignancies reported do not demonstrate any particular pattern and are not typical of those 
observed in an immunosuppressed population (e.g., no cases of lymphoma were reported). The IRs do 
not appear to indicate a significantly increased overall risk of malignancies or an incidence rate that 
increases with greater exposure duration. Longer follow-up with larger numbers of exposed patients are 
required to make a robust assessment regarding risk of malignancy associated with ozanimod treatment. 
In Pool D (UC, CD and MS studies), SDEIs of malignancy were reported in 47 (1.2%) out of 4057 
subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 2 (0.3%) out of 596 subjects in the placebo 
treatment group, which corresponds to an IR per 1000 SY of 4.0 and 6.9, respectively. 
Non-cutaneous malignancies (excluding NMSC) were reported in 29 (0.7%) subjects in the ozanimod 1 
mg treatment group and 2 (0.3%) subjects in the placebo treatment group. 
Non-melanoma skin cancers (cutaneous malignancies) were reported 18 (0.4%) subjects and 0 placebo 
subjects, respectively. Of note, phase 2 and 3 MS studies were active controlled. Breast cancers 
(preferred terms breast cancer, breast neoplasm, invasive breast carcinoma, and invasive ductal breast 
carcinoma) were reported in 9 (0.2%) out of 4057 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 1 
(0.2%) out of 596 subjects in the placebo treatment group. 
Pulmonary Effects 
Pulmonary function is known to be affected by S1P modulators. In nonclinical studies, ozanimod did not 
induce smooth muscle hypertrophy, increased collagen or fibrin deposition in the lung as has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 181/209 
 
 
 
 
reported with fingolimod. No effect on respiratory function was observed with ozanimod administration in 
rodents. 
Pulmonary safety for ozanimod was examined in the clinical development program using spirometry, 
diffusing capacity (DLCO) and AEs related to pulmonary function designated as AESIs in Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 UC studies. 
Small changes were observed with the spirometry assessments specifically the FEV1 and FVC (less than 
100 ml, 1.3%) parameters for the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and were primarily driven by changes 
during the first 3 months. At week 10, median change from baseline in FEV1 (FVC) was -0.05 (-0.03) in 
the ozanimod and -0.02 (± 0) in the placebo group (Pool Fi). 
These small changes were not progressive with longer observation. In addition, there is evidence for 
reversibility based on the data from the RPC01-3101 MP where subjects re-randomized to placebo had a 
return towards baseline of their spirometry assessments (FEV1 and FVC).  
Change from baseline in FEV1 during controlled maintenance phase (Pool Fm) is presented in the 
following table. Respective course in FVC was generally comparable. 
Table 93: Change from baseline in FEV1 (L) by Visit – Pool Fm (Safety Population) 
Small but highly variable changes were noted in DLCO with only a fraction of subjects (≤ 26%) assessed. 
To account for visit-to-visit variability in FEV1 and FVC, an outlier analysis of PFTs was conducted 
examining subjects with < 70% of predicted and < 70% of baseline values at two consecutive visits, or at 
the last postbaseline visit. Using this approach, the incidence was lower with ozanimod 1 mg (0.2% for 
FEV1 and < 0.1% for FVC) than placebo (0.7% and 0.7%, respectively). These subjects did not have 
accompanying respiratory AEs. 
Respiratory SOC TEAEs in the controlled studies were similar across treatment groups (2.2% in ozanimod 
and 1.4% in placebo subjects in Pool Fi and 3.0% in the ozanimod-ozanimod and 3.1% in the ozanimod-
placebo group in Pool Fm, respectively) with no serious TEAEs and 1 TEAE that led to treatment 
discontinuation (shortness of breath, mild, considered not related in a subject with a history of chronic 
bronchitis). 
Examination of subjects who are at greater risk for lung disease (i.e., smokers) demonstrated no clinically 
meaningful changes FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio in subjects treated with ozanimod. 
The totality of the pulmonary data indicates that mild reductions in FEV1 and DLCO occurred early in 
treatment with ozanimod 1 mg,but were not clinically meaningful and these changes were not progressive 
over time. Furthermore, the data do not demonstrate an increased incidence of respiratory-related AEs in 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021

comparison to placebo. The limited effect on pulmonary function in patients with UC treated with 
ozanimod is similar to that observed in MS.  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
One case of PRES has been reported in Pool D, has occurred in the MS program and has been evaluated 
during authorisation procedure of ozanimod. No further case of PRES has occurred in the UC studies. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations were performed in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 UC studies at baseline, regular 
intervals ranging between 4 to 12 weeks throughout the treatment periods, and approximately 1 month 
following discontinuation of study drug. 
Absolute Lymphocyte Count 
In Pool Fi, as expected decreases in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), were evident at the first 
assessment at Week 5 in subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg. The mean percent decreases from 
baseline in ALC were 47.2% (to approx. 53% baseline value) at Week 5 and 52.8% (to approx. 47% 
baseline value) at Week 10 in the ozanimod 1 mg group. Subjects who received ozanimod 1 mg during 
Study 3101 Induction and Maintenance Periods showed a sustained reduction of ALC that was generally 
maintained below the baseline value. Steady state simulations indicated that UC patients receiving 
ozanimod 1 mg are predicted to have a mean steady state reduction in ALC of 57.2% (please refer to 
assessment of PK/PD modelling, in Section 5.3.4 of this Report, above). 
In Pool Fi, there was a low incidence of ALC values < 0.2 x 109/L in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group 
(1/475 [0.2%] at Week 5 and 5/460 [1.1%] at Week 10 (vs. no cases in the placebo group each). In 
Pool Fm, among subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg treatment group, the overall incidence 
of ALC values < 0.2 x 109/L at any time throughout the treatment period was 3.0% and at the last 
available assessment was 1.4%. Following withdrawal of ozanimod 1 mg among subjects who were re-
randomized to placebo there were no subjects who had an ALC < 0.2 x 109/L from the first assessment 
at Week 18 through the last assessment at Week 52. 
Lymphocyte recovery: 
According to the UC study protocols, if ALC was confirmed < 0.2 x 109/L then the investigator was to 
temporarily discontinue investigational drug and repeat laboratory testing weekly until ALC > 0.5 x 109/L, 
at which point reinitiation of study drug was permitted. 
Based on the minimum values across all assessments in Pool G, an ALC < 0.2 x 109/L occurred in 60 
(5.3%) subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg. Of these, 52 subjects had an available subsequent 
laboratory assessment on study drug and were evaluable for on-treatment ALC recovery. Of these 52 
subjects, 25 subjects had laboratory assessments available for analysis at 2 weeks following the first 
abnormality in ALC of < 0.2 x 109/L. Nineteen of these 25 subjects had an increase in ALC to ≥ 0.2 x 
109/L and 4 had an increase in ALC ≥ 0.5 x 109/L. All 52 subjects who had an ALC < 0.2 x 109/L while on 
treatment with ozanimod 1 mg recovered to an ALC ≥ 0.2 x 109/L.  
Off-treatment recovery: Based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates conducted on 325 subjects in Pool G, the 
median time to recovery of ALC to the normal range (≥ 1 x 109/L) was 35 days (95% CI 33, 37). 
Approximately 68% of subjects recovered to the normal range 2 months after discontinuation of 
ozanimod 1 mg, and approximately 82% subjects recovered to the normal range 3 months after 
discontinuation of ozanimod 1 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 183/209 
 
 
 
 
These observations are generally consistent with the PK/PD simulations for ALC recovery to ≥ 1 x 109/L, 
which predicted a mean time to recovery of 32.8 days with 90% of subjects recovering in ~3 months.  
In Pool Fi, mean percent decreases from baseline in leukocyte [WBC] count were approximately 17% at 
the first assessment (Week 5) and 23% at the end of the Induction Period (Week 10) in the ozanimod 1 
mg treatment group. These changes were expected and related to the reduction in ALC. There were no 
subjects with a WBC value < 2 x 109/L in Pool Fi. 
Reductions in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1 x 109/L occurred in <1% in both treatment groups of 
Pool Fi and occurred in one subject in each treatment group during 3101 maintenance period. 
For liver enzyme parameters, please see section on AESI. There were no other notable changes from 
baseline or trends over time in chemistry in subjects receiving ozanimod. 
Urinalysis 
In Pool Fi, Pool Fm and Pool G, respectively, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in 
mean urinalysis parameters in the ozanimod treatment group relative to placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
Age (Evaluation of Pool G): 
Population PK analysis showed that CC112273 steady-state exposure in elderly subjects with UC was  
increased compared to younger adults with UC, with a 22% increase in adults 55 to 65 years of age and 
27% increase in those > 65 years of age compared to adults < 45 years of age.  
The effect of age on TEAE and serious TEAE incidence in Pool G was evaluated on subjects < 65 years and 
≥ 65 years. Approximately 95% of the subjects in the Safety Population of Pool G were < 65 years; thus, 
comparisons between subgroups should be interpreted with caution. The subgroup < 65 years included 
481 subjects in the placebo treatment group and 1103 subjects in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group, 
while the subgroup ≥ 65 years was limited to 27 subjects in the placebo treatment group and 55 subjects 
in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group. Of the 55 subjects ≥ 65 years who were treated with ozanimod 1 
mg, 28 of these subjects (50.9%) were exposed for at least 12 months. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in the placebo treatment group was higher in the subgroup ≥ 65 years 
compared to those < 65 years (55.6% versus 39.9%, respectively), but the overall incidence of TEAEs 
among subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg was similar in the subgroup ≥ 65 years compared with the 
subgroup < 65 years (69.1% versus 68.7%, respectively). A greater percentage of serious TEAEs were 
reported for subjects ≥ 65 years than < 65 years in both placebo and ozanimod 1 mg treatment groups 
(11.1% versus 6.7% and 20.0% versus 12.7%, respectively). However, most serious TEAEs were isolated 
events with no apparent relationship to age with the exception of a slightly higher percentages of subjects 
≥ 65 years reporting infections compared with those < 65 years in both ozanimod 1 mg (5.5% versus 
2.0%, respectively) and placebo (3.7% versus 1.2%, respectively) treatment groups. 
Based on a median age of 40 years, the effect of age on TEAEs has also been evaluated on subjects ≤ 40 
years and > 40 years. There was no clinically meaningful difference in the overall incidence of TEAEs or 
SAE between subjects ≤ 40 years of age and > 40 years of age in the ozanimod or placebo groups, 
respectively.  
Gender: 
The overall incidence of TEAEs was greater among female than male subjects in the both, the placebo and 
ozanimod 1 mg treatment groups of Pool G, which is partially attributable to higher incidences of TEAEs in 
the Blood and Lymphatic Disorders (24.9% vs. 14.8%) and Nervous System Disorders (14.0% vs. 9.0%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 184/209 
 
 
 
 
SOCs among female versus male subjects, respectively. Among subjects treated with ozanimod 1 mg, 
higher incidences of lymphopenia and lymphocyte count decreased were reported for female subjects 
compared to male subjects (12.6% vs. 6.4%, respectively, and 9.1% vs. 4.1%, respectively). This 
imbalance and associated risk of lymphopenia are consistent with an ~34% increase in the PK exposure 
of CC112273, the major active metabolite, in female patients compared to males.  
Additionally, while the overall incidence of Investigations was similar between female and male subjects 
who were treated with ozanimod 1 mg, greater proportions of male subjects experienced TEAEs related to 
elevated liver function tests than female subjects. 
Within the subgroups of female and male subjects, the pattern of TEAEs was generally consistent with the 
overall population. The predominant SOCs (≥ 15% among ozanimod-treated subjects in either subgroup) 
were Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Investigations. 
There were no clinically meaningful effects of sex on serious TEAE incidence among subjects who were 
treated with ozanimod 1 mg in Pool G. 
Extrinsic factors 
Baseline Corticosteroid Use 
Pool G comprised approximately twice as many subjects who reported not using corticosteroids than 
using corticosteroids at screening. The predominant SOCs were Infections and Infestations, 
Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Investigations (> 15 % among ozanimod-treated subjects in either 
subgroup). Among subjects who were treated with ozanimod 1 mg, the incidence of TEAEs was higher in 
the subgroup using corticosteroids at screening than the subgroup not using corticosteroids at screening 
(74.7% versus 65.3%, respectively). The incidence of infections in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group 
was higher in subjects using corticosteroids at screening than in those not using corticosteroids at 
screening (35.7% versus 25.3%) and higher compared with placebo in both subgroups (16.0% versus 
13.0%, respectively). The most frequently reported infections among ozanimod-treated subjects using 
corticosteroids at baseline were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and bronchitis; and 
nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, and herpes zoster among subjects not using corticosteroids at 
baseline. The incidence of serious infections in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group was low and similar 
between subjects using and not using corticosteroids at screening (2.4% versus 2.0%, respectively), with 
no predominant type of serious infection in either subgroup. Overall, similar patterns of TEAEs and SAEs 
by corticosteroid use at screening were observed for Pool Fm. 
Prior anti-TNF use  
Pool G comprised approximately twice as many subjects who reported no prior anti-TNF use (364 placebo 
and 782 ozanimod 1 mg subjects) compared with prior anti-TNF use (144 placebo and 376 ozanimod 1 mg 
subjects),  and  exposure to  ozanimod 1  mg  was  longer  in  the  subgroup  with no  prior  anti-TNF  exposure 
relative  to  the  subgroup  with  prior  anti-TNF  exposure  (approximately  21  months  versus  15.5  months, 
respectively). Within subgroups, the pattern of TEAEs was generally consistent with that of the overall Pool 
G population. However, the overall incidence of TEAEs was greater among subjects who had prior anti TNF 
exposure relative to those without prior anti-TNF exposure for both ozanimod 1 mg (75.5% versus 65.5%, 
respectively) and placebo group (45.1% versus 39.0%, respectively) due to greater incidences of commonly 
reported  TEAEs  across  multiple  SOCs,  including  Infections  and  Infestations,  Gastrointestinal  Disorders, 
Musculoskeletal  and  Connective  Tissue  Disorders,  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions, 
and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders (35.4%, 27.1%, 16.8%, 16.0% , and 14.4% versus 26.1%, 
18.3%, 9.0%, and 7.4%, 7.2%, respectively). 
Assessment report

 The incidence of serious infections was slightly higher among subjects with prior anti-TNF exposure than 
those without prior anti-TNF exposure in both the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group (3.2% versus 1.7%) 
and the placebo group (2.1% versus 1.1%); no pattern of infections was seen. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
In reproductive toxicity studies presented in the MS submission, embryofoetal development was 
adversely affected by maternal treatment with ozanimod, with low (rats) or no (rabbits) safety margins 
based on comparison of systemic exposures to total active drug, resulting in embryolethality and 
teratogenicity (generalised oedema/anasarca and malpositioned testes in rats, malpositioned caudal 
vertebrae and malformations of the great vessels in rabbits). The vascular findings in rats and rabbits are 
consistent with the expected S1P1 pharmacology.  
Pre- and post-natal development was not affected by ozanimod administration up to the 5.6-fold the 
systemic exposure to total active drug at the maximum human dose of 0.92 mg ozanimod. Ozanimod and 
metabolites were present in rat milk. 
Throughout the ozanimod clinical development program, pregnant and lactating women were excluded from 
study  participation.  Female  subjects  of  reproductive  potential  were  required  to  use  protocol-approved, 
effective means of contraception for the duration of their participation in ozanimod studies. 
As of 31 Mar 2020, a total of 75 pregnancies have been reported in the safety database in subjects 
treated with ozanimod (n = 55) or their partners (n = 20) across all indications (UC, CD, and MS) and 
including 1 healthy volunteer. All pregnancy exposures for study subjects occurred during the first 
trimester and subjects discontinued study medication promptly, with the exception of subjects who 
elected termination and did not discontinue study medication. No teratogenicity was observed. Of the 55 
subject pregnancies, 24 resulted in live birth of a healthy infant, 2 resulted in live birth with congenital 
abnormality, 3 resulted in premature delivery, 8 resulted in spontaneous early loss, 12 subjects 
underwent elective abortion, and 6 subjects had not yet delivered. Among 20 partner pregnancies, 7 
resulted in live birth of a healthy infant, 2 resulted in live birth with congenital abnormality not considered 
to be teratogenic effects, 5 resulted in premature delivery, 1 resulted in spontaneous early loss, and 1 
was ongoing.  
Overdose 
Unintentional overdose of ozanimod 1 mg, defined as any dose given to, or taken by, a subject that 
exceeded the dose described in the protocol, was reported in approximately 60 subjects in RPC01 3101 
and RPC01-3102. Of these, there were 3 subjects who experienced TEAEs (all nonserious) associated with 
the overdose of ozanimod 1 mg in RPC01 3101: one Subject experienced LFT increased, which led to 
discontinuation; another Subject experienced abdominal distention, which did not lead to any action 
taken with study drug (the subject withdrew from the study); and one Subject experienced ECG QTcF 
prolongation with dizziness, which resolved on treatment. 
Withdrawal and rebound 
The long half-life of the drug’s active metabolites leads to a very slow decline in drug activity. Thus, 
discontinuation of therapy does not result in an abrupt decline in S1P agonist activity. 
To evaluate disease rebound or relapse effects following discontinuation of ozanimod 1 mg treatment in 
the UC clinical program, an assessment of TEAEs with onset after the last dose of ozanimod 1 mg was 
performed on Pool G and Pool D.  
In Pool G, 78 of 488 subjects (16.0%) in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group and 5 of 48 subjects 
(10.4%) in the placebo treatment group had an TEAE with an onset after the last dose of study drug. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 186/209 
 
 
 
 
higher frequency of subjects having TEAEs between treatment groups can be attributed to the disparate 
observation periods (amounting to 6.6 and 80.7 patient years for the placebo and ozanimod 1 mg 
treatment groups after the last dose of study drug). In Pool G, TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 0.5% of subjects 
in the ozanimod 1 mg treatment group after the last dose of study drug were ulcerative colitis (2.9%), 
anaemia (1.6%), headache (0.8%), hypertension (0.8%), nausea (0.8%), vomiting (0.6%), ALT 
increased (0.6%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (0.6%), and nasopharyngitis (0.6%). Similar 
findings were observed in Pool D, albeit at a lower overall frequency. 
According to the Applicant, there was no evidence of severely increased disease activity in subjects who 
were re-randomized to placebo in the Phase 3 UC study.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
It is noted that the patients in the main studies were not allowed to have any concomitant 
immunosuppressant (e.g. thiopurines). Since thiopurines are a cornerstone in the treatment of 
moderate/severe UC, this information is important for the prescriber and updated information on the 
concomitant use of immunosuppressive therapies that should be avoided and the limited long term data 
are introduced (section 4.4).   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation and/or study withdrawal was low and similar 
between  the  ozanimod  1  mg  and  placebo  treatment  groups  during  the  Pool  Fi  (3.0%  versus  2.8%, 
respectively) and between the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg and ozanimod 1 mg – placebo treatment 
groups  during  the  RPC01-3101  Maintenance  Period Pool Fm  (1.3%  versus  2.6%,  respectively).  In  both 
periods, ulcerative colitis (worsening/flare) was the only TEAE leading to discontinuation of more than 1 
subject, at a lower incidence with ozanimod 1 mg than placebo in both Pool FI and Pool Fm. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable; ozanimod was not commercially available at the time of the safety cut-off (31 Mar 2020). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database available for the proposed UC indication is generally considered acceptable. Overall 
exposure with the intended maintenance dose of 1 mg ozanimod comprises a total of 1158 UC subjects 
and 4057 subjects across all indications. 868 UC subjects have been exposed for ≥ 6 months, 716 
subjects for ≥12 months and 322 subjects for ≥ 24 months. In order to mitigate fist dose cardiac effects, a 
one-week dose escalation was applied in the UC studies in line with the titration proposed and approved 
for the MS indication.  
However, available efficacy and safety data in the MS indication in subjects > 55 years is still limited. 
From the hitherto provided analyses of safety data in UC subjects ≥ 65 years, which are mainly based on 
a cut-off age of 40 years, only a small group of patients >65 is included. 
Evaluation of safety is focused to the controlled experience with ozanimod 1 mg compared to placebo 
during the induction period (Pool Fi) as well as the placebo-controlled randomised withdrawal period of 
study 3101 (Pool Fm). In addition, long-term safety in UC was assessed based on overall UC Pool G, Pool 
D comprising all indications was used for the evaluation of rare events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 187/209 
 
 
 
 
Safety data derived from Pool Fi are generally adequate in order to evaluate adverse effects of ozanimod 
associated with treatment initiation. However, the duration of the induction period, i.e. total treatment 
including titration of 9 weeks (study 202) and 10 weeks (study 3101), respectively, is too short, in order 
to evaluate any long-term effects. Of note, the nadir of mean ALC reduction is expected to have been 
reached only towards the end of the induction period. Evaluation of the frequency of TEAEs during the 42-
week maintenance Pool Fm is limited due to prior ozanimod treatment of subjects, who have been re-
randomised to placebo, inclusion of subjects with prior open-label ozanimod treatment in the blinded 
ozanimod-ozanimod group, as well as different exposure rates across treatment groups (approx. 166 SY 
in the ozanimod-ozanimod and 134 in the ozanimod-placebo group, respectively). The small placebo 
group of study 3101 (n=69) with a short exposure was not included in Pool Fm.  
In study 202, randomised subjects were continuously treated with the assigned treatment (ozanimod 
1mg, 05 mg or placebo, respectively). However, overall treatment duration comprised 33 weeks only (9 
weeks during induction and 24 weeks maintenance treatment, respectively). While the induction period of 
this study was included in Pool Fi, the maintenance period of this study was only included in the 
uncontrolled UC Pool G due to differences in design and duration of studies 202 and 3103, respectively. 
Nevertheless, evaluated on its own, no new safety signals derived from the controlled maintenance part 
of this study.  
Comparability of frequencies of TEAEs across MS and UC studies is limited due to differences in study 
duration and design. However, taking the above limitations into account, the safety profile of ozanimod 
appears largely similar in the MS and UC indication. 
The main safety issues identified in the MS clinical program were small and transient decreases in heart 
rate, mainly during the first 8 days of dose titration and symptomatic in few cases only (brady-
arrhythmias), macular oedemas, overall reversible increases in liver enzymes and reversible decreases in 
ALC, as well as an increased risk of herpes zoster infections with long-term treatment and a 
disproportionate higher incidence in malignancies with ozanimod vs. IFN ß-1a. The long-term risk for 
serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies could not sufficiently be characterised within the 
limited period of clinical MS studies and thus prompted pharmacovigilance activity post-approval. 
Apart from a higher incidence of Herpes zoster (“common” instead of “uncommon”) and addition of 
Herpes simplex as an (“common”) event, no relevant changes to the safety profile of ozanimod are 
proposed to be added by the Applicant within this variation procedure. These changes are based on the 
findings from controlled maintenance Pool Fm with Herpes zoster being reported in 2.2% of ozanimod vs. 
04% placebo subjects, which is also consistent with the reporting rate of Herpes zoster in (long-term) 
Pool G in ozanimod treated subjects of 2.2%. Herpes simplex was reported (per logical grouping with PT 
oral herpes or herpes simplex) in 1.7% of ozanimod subjects (vs. 0 placebo subjects) in the maintenance 
period of study 3101 (Pool Fm).  
In the UC studies, the most frequently reported TEAEs, which occurred at a (≥ 1%) higher frequency 
compared with placebo during the induction period (Pool Fi) are in line with the findings in the MS 
indication, apart from nausea, pyrexia and arthralgia. These are common complaints in patients with UC 
and differences in ozanimod vs. placebo subjects were still small (< 2% each). Further, nausea, pyrexia 
and arthralgia were not among the most frequent TEAEs, which occurred at a (≥ 1%) higher frequency in 
Pool Fm.  
However, during the controlled maintenance period (Pool Fm), the TEAEs which occurred at a (≥ 1%) 
higher frequency in the ozanimod (ozanimod-ozanimod) compared to the placebo (ozanimod-placebo) 
group and are not yet included in 4.8 of the SmPC were headache (3.5% vs. 0.4%) and peripheral 
oedema  (2.6% vs. 0%). Only 9 of 19 cases of headache in the ozanimod group of Pool Fi were mild, and 
headache occurred also with higher frequency (6.0% vs. 1.6%), but also with higher incidence rate (IR, 
37.6 vs. 32.5) in ozanimod-ozanimod vs. ozanimod-placebo subjects in Pool G.  
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021

In addition, hot flush occurred on Day 1 in 2 ozanimod but in no placebo subjects in the UC studies (Pool 
Fi). Of note, hot flush also occurred in the active controlled phase 3 RMS studies (Pool A1) likewise on 
Day 1 with higher frequency in ozanimod (0.2%) vs. placebo subjects (0.1%).  
No new safety signal arose from analyses of SAEs in Pool Fi and Pool Fm. Nevertheless, there appeared 
some imbalance with regard to SAEs of ischaemic stroke derived from Pool G with an incidence of 4 
(0.3%) in ozanimod vs. 0 placebo subjects and corresponding IRs per 1000 SY of 2.1 vs. 0, respectively. 
Subjects with clinically relevant cardiac conditions were excluded from the UC studies. No increased risk 
of thromboembolic events was derived from the MS development program of ozanimod and ulcerative 
colitis itself is associated with a higher risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism.  
The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation and/or study withdrawal was low and similar 
between the ozanimod 1 mg and placebo treatment groups in Pool Fi (3.0% versus 2.8%, respectively) 
and between the ozanimod 1 mg – ozanimod 1 mg and ozanimod 1 mg – placebo treatment groups in 
Pool Fm (1.3% vs. 2.6%, respectively). 
As of data cut-off (31 Mar 2020), 14 deaths occurred in the overall ozanimod program across all 
indications, 7 of which have already been assessed during the marketing authorisation procedure for MS. 
While a numerical imbalance of death cases was found in the MS study program (2 death cases in Pool A1 
occurring on ozanimod vs. none on placebo), death cases the UC indication occurred only during open-
label treatment with ozanimod (N=3). In line with the findings from the death cases reviewed during the 
marketing authorisation of ozanimod for MS, no common pattern could be derived from the additional 
death cases provided with this variation. Two cases might involve immunosuppressant properties and two 
cases were reported in the context of malignancies.  
Frequency and type of cardiac TEAEs (mainly bradycardia during treatment initiation and blood pressure 
effects with continued treatment) reported in the UC studies appear in line with the known safety profile 
of ozanimod. Patients with severe cardiac pre-morbid conditions were excluded from clinical studies in 
both, the MS and UC indication, and are likewise to be excluded from treatment with ozanimod 
(contraindication in section 4.3). In other less severe instances of cardiovascular impairment, cardiologist 
advice should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment. The proposed SmPC was amended in order to 
correctly inform about an increase in diastolic blood pressure observed in UC subjects in section 4.8, 
which is in line with the increase in DBP described for the MS indication. 
The hepatic effects of ozanimod established for the MS indication, i.e. increase in liver function tests, 
typically ALT ≥3x ULN and GGT>2.5x ULN, occurred likewise in the UC population. No severe cases of 
DILI or confirmed cases of Hy’s law occurred in the UC studies. Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C) were not studied and treatment with ozanimod is thus contraindicated in such 
patients. Severe liver injury is a potential risk in the RMP. However, increased AST, which occurred 
almost congruently with ALT elevations but generally at a smaller magnitude and has also been reported 
as TEAE in the UC studies (e.g. 1.2% in ozanimod vs. 0% in placebo subjects in Pool Fi) and was added 
to section 4.8 of the SmPC under selected adverse drug reactions. 
Consistent with the MS program, TEAEs of infections in the UC program were mainly characterised by 
non-serious infections of the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, viral respiratory tract 
infection). During long-term treatment (Pool G), the incidence of serious infections was 2.2% with 
ozanimod and 1.4% with placebo. Opportunistic infections were more frequently reported with ozanimod 
compared with placebo with an incidence of 2.4% vs. 0.4% (and an IR of 14.8 vs. 8.1, respectively), and 
were predominantly cases of Herpes zoster. As of the data-cut off, there were no cases of PML or 
cryptococcal meningitis SDEIs in the entire ozanimod development program. 
Overall, based on the UC studies, herpes zoster, headache and peripheral oedema ADRs in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC are introduced with a frequency of common.  
Assessment report

From the UC program, no new safety signals arose with regard to macular oedema, which concerned 
exclusively subjects with pre-existing risk factors, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES, 
no new cases) and pulmonary effects, respectively.  
There is a potential risk of malignancies with ozanimod. From the controlled UC program as well as from 
the incidence rates (IR) provided for the overall UC studies no imbalance was found with regard to all 
malignancies and non-cutaneous malignancies, respectively. However, interpretability of controlled 
maintenance (Pool Fm) data with regard to malignancies is limited by the fact, that subjects re-
randomised to placebo were treated with ozanimod for approx. 10 weeks prior to the maintenance study 
phase. Few patients (n=69) in the maintenance part of study 3101 were exclusively treated with placebo 
and no malignancy was observed within this group. However, the extent of safety follow up in this 
subgroup was comparably low and these subjects were not included in Pool Fm. 
 The overall incidence of any malignancy as well as colorectal cancer (CRC) malignancies (3 cases in 
approx. 2000 SY) in the UC study program was in the range of epidemiological UC data. Furthermore, no 
cluster of non-cutaneous malignancies or lymphoma was found and there was no apparent increase in IR 
with greater exposure duration. Half of the neoplasms reported with ozanimod in UC studies were non-
melanoma skin malignancies with basal cell carcinoma presenting as the most common skin neoplasm 
congruent with the findings in the MS population. Of note, cutaneous malignancies, i.e. 5 cases (0.4%) of 
basal cell carcinoma and 1 case (< 0.1%) of squamous cell carcinoma solely occurred in ozanimod but 
not in placebo subjects in Pool G.). While there is considerable variability across countries, the IRs of 
NMSC in the UC study program (2.6 for basal cell carcinoma and 0.5 for squamous cell carcinoma, 
respectively) were also generally within the range reported in literature. However, a warning has been 
introduced in section 4.4 as follows: 
In patients treated with ozanimod in UC controlled clinical studies one patient (0.2%) had squamous cell 
carcinoma of the skin, in the induction period, and one patient (0.4%) had basal cell carcinoma, in the 
maintenance period. There were no cases in patients who received placebo.  
UC associated CRC is considered a serious complication of the disease and colorectal cancer (UC 
indication)” is now included as an important potential risk in the RMP upon request from PRAC.   
The RMP version 2.1 submitted by the MAH on 30th September is considered approvable and represents a 
consolidated  version  between  the  last  approved  version  with  the  recent  PML  variation  and  the  versions 
assessed across this procedure.  
The ongoing long-term studies are deemed essential to further address the potential risk of malignancies. 
The findings derived from the UC studies with regard to mean reduction in ALC from baseline, the 
incidence of CTCAE Grade 4 ALC reductions < 0.2 x 109/L, as well as ALC recovery were in largely in line 
with those seen in the MS studies. However, as the nadir of mean decrease in ALC is expected to have 
been reached only towards the end of the induction period, the incidence of Grade 4 ALC decrease to 
<0.2 x 109/L in SmPC section 4.8 was corrected from ‘< 3%’ to ‘3%’ (as derived from analyses of Pool 
Fm). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database available for the proposed UC indication is considered acceptable and the posology 
including titration proposed for UC is in line with the one established for MS. Available data in the MS 
indication in subjects > 55 years is still limited. From the provided analyses of limited safety data in UC 
subjects ≥ 65 years, no indication of a worse safety profile in the elderly is evident but data is very 
limited.

The clinical safety profile of ozanimod in UC based on the available short- and long-term study data are 
considered to be manageable by applying the proposed risk minimisation measures in the product 
information together with continued long-term safety data collection post-marketing.  
Although, comparability of the frequencies of adverse events across indications is limited due to 
differences in design and duration of studies, the safety profile derived from the UC study program 
appears largely in line with that of the MS clinical program. A higher incidence of Herpes zoster 
(frequency “common” instead of “uncommon”), addition of Herpes simplex, headache and peripheral 
oedema as “common” event are introduced.  
The case of a squamous cell carcinoma is also introduced in section 4.4 as well as recommendation to 
avoid concomitant use of antineoplastic, non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive (e.g. azathioprine and 6-
mercaptopurine in UC), or immune-modulating therapies with ozanimod 
The RMP (version 2.1) is also updated to reflect the safety profile in patients with UC, in particular CRC as 
an important potential risk and acceptable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Ozanimod is being approved for UC patient, which represent a different patient population than the 
current indication (RRMS). indication. Therefore, the PRAC/CHMP considered that an increase in PSUR 
frequency is warranted to monitor adequately the safety profile of mepolizumab in the new patient 
population. The PSUR frequency is therefore increased to 6 monthly-basis. The MAH should plan at least a 
further 6-month DLP period after the next December 2021 submission. 
Based on the above considerations, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD 
list for mepolizumab needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should 
follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 19 Nov 2021.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The CHMP received the following PRAC 
Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: The PRAC considered that the risk management plan 
version 2.1 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and Annex 
IID are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement editorial changes throughout the product information. 
In addition, an update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order to update the current SmPC 
description about PK interaction with BCRP inhibitors based on the study report from a drug interaction 
study with cyclosporine (RPC-1063-CP-001).  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: limited changes 
introduced. 
2.8.  Therapeutic Context 
2.8.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for is for the induction and maintenance of remission of adult patients with 
moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response with, loss of 
response to, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or a biologic agent. The treatment is by the 
oral route. 
UC is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by alternating episodes of 
remission and spontaneous relapse. The primary treatment goal is to induce remission and then to 
maintain this state. As mentioned earlier in this report, this treatment paradigm is currently proposed to 
be changed to a “treat-to-target” approach, which requires continuous monitoring and therapeutic 
adjustments with an aim to achieve the targets of full resolution of symptoms and mucosal and 
histological normalisation of the mucosa in order to protect patients from complications and the need for 
surgery. The “therapeutic adjustment” therefore requires a potential high variety of treatment options 
which can address the partial unmet medical need based on the fact that available treatments have 
relevant rates of missing or minor clinical and endoscopic response and remission rates only. 
Ozanimod is approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) with active disease as defined by clinical or imaging features. 
The mechanism by which ozanimod exerts therapeutic effects in MS and UC is unknown but may involve 
the reduction of lymphocyte migration into the central nervous system (CNS) and intestine. The 
ozanimod-induced reduction of lymphocytes in the peripheral circulation has differential effects on 
leucocyte subpopulations, with greater decreases in cells involved in the adaptive immune response. 
Ozanimod has minimal impact on cells involved in innate immune response, which are key components of 
immunosurveillance.  
2.8.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment paradigm for UC has historically comprised an initial treatment for acute disease, with the 
goal of inducing a state of clinical remission, followed by a therapeutic intervention to maintain remission. 
Generally, patients presenting with mild to moderate disease activity are initially administered an anti-
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 196/209 
 
 
 
 
 
inflammatory agent such as a 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) derivative, with or without concurrent 
corticosteroids. Patients who fail to respond to initial therapy or who present with moderate to severe 
disease activity require treatment with agents indicated for moderate to severe disease such as 
immunomodulators/-suppressives and biologic therapy. For nearly 2 decades, biological therapies were 
dominated by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents but have recently included anti-integrin and 
anti–interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 antibodies, as well as JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib).  
Although biological therapies have led to substantial improvements in the care of patients with UC and 
have become an integral part of standard therapy, not all treated patients benefit from these therapies. 
Depending on the duration of therapy and the clinical endpoints chosen, approximately one-third of 
patients do not respond after initiation of biological therapy (primary nonresponse). Among patients who 
initially respond to treatment with biologics, 30%to 50% eventually stop responding (secondary 
nonresponse), resulting in exposure to potential side effects and toxicities without durable clinical benefit. 
These findings highlight the partial unmet medical need still present in these patients. In recent years 
there appears to be a paradigm shift in the treatment of IBD (including UC) from the “induction and 
maintenance” to a “treat to target approach” where the final aim of treatment is the prevention of 
abdominal surgery/colectomy. The risk of surgery is still considered substantial with about 11-12% of the 
patients receiving surgery within 5, and 15-16% within 10 years of disease duration. The paradigm shift 
is expressed as moving from the aim to induce and maintain clinical remission, to a full resolution of the 
inflammatory signs within the mucosa, expressed as endoscopic healing or histological normalisation, 
which both have been identified to be predictive factors of the avoidance of surgery. 
Despite the advances in therapies for patients, there remains a significant need for UC treatments with 
novel mechanisms and an acceptable safety profile that can be administered orally to patients who do not 
respond to, or have an inadequate response to conventional therapy or who had primary or secondary 
nonresponse to anti-TNF or other biologic therapy or were intolerant to either treatment. 
2.8.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence for the demonstration of efficacy comes from the pivotal phase 3 study RPC01-3101, 
which was a multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and 
safety study in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The study was divided into two parts 
with an induction phase of 10 weeks, and a maintenance phase of additional 42 weeks. The induction 
phase included two different cohorts of patients, one of which was randomised 2:1 to receive ozanimod 1 
mg or placebo (n=429 and 216), and the other of which received open-label treatment for 10 weeks 
(n=367). This latter cohort (as well as the 2:1 randomisation) was obviously implemented in order to 
achieve a sufficient number of patients reaching clinical response at the end of the 10-week treatment 
period. 
Patients were included into this trial based on the presence of moderate to severe disease for at least 3 
months, and based on a 6-12 4-component Mayo score with additional requirements for endoscopic score 
(at least 2) and the two symptoms rectal bleeding and stool frequency abnormality (at least 1). Patients 
were requested to receive either 5-aminosalicylate and/or corticosteroid treatment at inclusion, the 
additional option of having received previously either biological or immunosuppressant treatment with an 
at least 8-week duration and having not or only insufficiently responded (or experienced tolerability 
problems) with these treatments. Patients with acute severe colitis were not admitted to the study. 
Patients to be included into the maintenance phase of the study had to achieve “clinical response” which 
was defined both on the total (4-component) Mayo Score as well as the 3-point Mayo score (excluding 
physician’s global assessment). Response usually comprised a relevant reduction of the respective score 
with requirements for all components included. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 197/209 
 
 
 
 
For the maintenance phase, patients were randomised 1:1 to be treated with either placebo or ozanimod 
1 mg daily (n=227 and 230). The treatment continued for 42 weeks in order to make up a total 
treatment duration of 52 weeks. 
Patients not reaching response during the induction period (both cohorts), patients experiencing relapse 
during the maintenance period, and patients reaching the end of the 52-weeks treatment period could 
enter an open-label long-term extension study. 
2.9.  Favourable effects 
At the end of the induction period, the percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint “clinical 
response” (defined as Rectal Bleeding subscore = 0 and Stool Frequency subscore ≤ 1 (and a decrease of 
≥ 1 point from the Baseline Stool Frequency subscore) and Endoscopy subscore ≤ 1; hence being a 
composite of two symptoms and mucosal improvement) was 18.4% in the active treatment group and 
6.0% in the placebo group. This difference was highly statistically different (p<0.0001). 
The key secondary endpoints (tested hierarchically with full type I error control showed rates of clinical 
response of 47.8% and 25.9%, endoscopic improvement of 27.3% and 11.6%, mucosal healing of 12.6% 
and 3.7, respectively. Other secondary endpoints such as histologic remission and symptomatic remission 
(defined post-hoc) showed rates of 18.2% and 7.4%, and 37.5% and 18.5% for the active and placebo 
groups, respectively. All results were consistently highly statistically significant. The results for the open-
label induction cohort were very much concordant with the results achieved in the randomised active 
treatment group of cohort 1. Favourable effects were also seen for part of the domains of quality of life, 
for work productivity, as well as for the biomarker calprotectin. 
For the maintenance period, the results for the primary endpoint “clinical remission” (similar definition as 
above) showed a rate of 37.0% for active treatment and 18.5% for placebo.  
A range of “key secondary endpoints” were included with full type I error control which were clinical 
response, endoscopic improvement, maintenance of remission (in those in remission when entering the 
maintenance period), corticosteroid free remission, mucosal healing, and durable remission (proportion of 
subjects with durable clinical remission defined as clinical remission at Week 10 and at 52 weeks in all 
patients who entered the maintenance phase), which all demonstrated superiority of the active 
treatment, similar to the “other” secondary endpoints histologic remission and symptomatic remission 
(defined post-hoc).  
The rate of relapse was higher in the placebo group as compared to the active treatment group (35.7% 
vs. 13.5%). All results were highly statistically significant with the majority of p-values being <0.0001 
and the “highest” p-value of 0.0025. Statistically significant effects were shown for part of the QoL 
domains, and work productivity, and also for part of the health care utilisation evaluation. Superiority was 
also demonstrated for the biomarker calprotectin. 
Both parts of the study were evaluated with relevant subgroup analyses, of which the most important 
were those used as stratification factors at inclusion (corticosteroid use and prior use of biologics/anti-
TNFs). For these subgroups, as well as relevant other subgroups (e.g. age, severity of baseline disease, 
years since diagnosis) highly consistent and statistically significant differences between active treatment 
and placebo could be demonstrated. The magnitude of effects, however, was slightly smaller in anti-TNF 
experienced subjects, compared to those not having received such treatments. 
Consistency of results was also demonstrated across a couple of other factors (e.g. region of the world, 
race, etc) but due to smaller sizes of the subgroups, statistical significance was not achieved in all of 
them. 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 198/209 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of the main results with a couple of so-called sensitivity analyses (e.g. using the PP population or 
using different imputation methods) also showed highly consistent results. 
Additionally PK interaction with BCRP inhibitors based on a drug interaction study with cyclosporin (RPC-
1063-CP-001) have been submitted and an update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC is agreed to 
inform prescribers on the absence of interaction in case of co-administration of ozanimod with ciclosporin. 
2.10.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant has conducted only one pivotal study for the induction of remission, whereas regulatory 
expectations usually request the presentation of two such studies. However, the applicant also presented 
a relatively robust phase 2 study (demonstrating statistically significant superiority of the dose of 1 mg 
daily in the primary endpoint) which would fulfil the requirements of two pivotal studies. Furthermore, the 
results achieved may be considered to fulfil the increased requirements on data quality, validity and 
statistical robustness for applications based on one single pivotal study. In addition, the open-label data 
provided (cohort 2 in the pivotal study and the open-label extension studies) also partly address this 
concern.  
The applicant has also included the wide variety of heterogeneous patients failing on previous treatments, 
which encompassed the huge variety of conventional immunosuppressants as well as biologics, when 
usually a separate trial in these “second line” and “third line” populations would be recommended. 
However, the level of consistency demonstrated with the trials could be considered sufficient to alleviate 
this concern. There is however some caveat related to the subgroups analysed, which did not display full 
consistency, but this may due to the limited number of included patients. Consistency has also been 
demonstrated in patients who failed other therapies historically, or a time of inclusion current both for 
biologics and conventional immunosuppressants.  
The study has also included patients up to the age of 75 only (as per inclusion criteria). The number of 
patients older than 65 is rather limited, introducing some uncertainty with regard to efficacy in this 
population. Although UC is a disease occurring at younger age, it is increasingly relevant also for an 
elderly patient population above 65 years of age. Respective warnings on the paucity of data in the 
elderly have been included in the product information. 
2.11.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database available for the proposed UC indication is generally considered acceptable. Overall 
exposure with the intended maintenance dose of 1 mg ozanimod comprises a total of 1158 UC subjects 
and 4057 subjects across all indications. 868 UC subjects have been exposed for ≥ 6 months, 716 
subjects for ≥12 months and 322 subjects for ≥ 24 months. In order to mitigate fist dose cardiac effects, a 
one-week dose escalation was applied in the UC studies in line with the titration proposed and approved 
for the MS indication. Initiation of ozanimod treatment using dose titration over 7 days is mechanistically 
based on the successive desensitization of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels via 
down-modulation of S1P1 receptors and was associated with a transient reduction in HR.  
In line with MS studies, treatment with ozanimod in UC resulted in a small average increase in systolic 
(SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure over placebo (mean increase in SBP was 5.1 mm Hg in the 
ozanimod-ozanimod group and 2.3 mm Hg in the placebo-ozanimod group and mean increase in DBP was 
2.2 mm Hg in the ozanimod-ozanimod group and 0.8 mm Hg in the placebo-ozanimod group at week 52 
compared to baseline); similar findings resulted from Pool Fi after 10 weeks of treatment.  
The main safety issues identified in the MS clinical program were small and transient decreases in heart 
rate, mainly during the first 8 days of dose titration and symptomatic in few cases only 
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 199/209 
 
 
 
 
(bradyarrhythmias), macular oedemas, overall reversible increases in liver enzymes and reversible 
decreases in ALC, as well as an increased risk of herpes zoster infections with long-term treatment and a 
disproportionate higher incidence in malignancies with ozanimod vs. IFN ß-1a. The long-term risk for 
serious or opportunistic infections and malignancies could not sufficiently be characterised within the 
limited period of clinical MS studies and thus prompted pharmacovigilance activity post-approval. 
The hepatic effects of ozanimod established for the MS indication, i.e. increase in liver function tests, 
typically ALT ≥3x ULN and GGT>2.5x ULN, occurred likewise in the UC population. No severe cases of 
DILI or confirmed cases of Hy’s law occurred in the UC studies. Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh class C) were not studied and treatment with ozanimod is thus contraindicated in such 
patients. Severe liver injury is a potential risk in the RMP. However, increased AST, which occurred 
almost congruently with ALT elevations but generally at a smaller magnitude and has also been reported 
as TEAE in the UC studies (e.g. 1.2% in ozanimod vs. 0% in placebo subjects in Pool Fi) and was added 
to section 4.8 of the SmPC under selected adverse drug reactions. Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class C) were not studied and treatment with ozanimod is thus contraindicated in 
such patients. Severe liver injury is a potential risk in the RMP. 
Reductions in lymphocyte counts have, based on the mode of action of ozanimod, expectedly been 
reported in nearly all patients in the ozanimod 1 mg group. In the UC clinical studies, the incidence of 
CTCAE Grade 4 ALC reductions < 0.2 x 109/L was 1.1% with ozanimod at  the end of Pool Fi period, 
3.0% at any time throughout maintenance in the ozanimod-ozanimod group (Pool Fm), and 5.3% in Pool 
G among subjects who were treated with ozanimod 1 mg. In Pool G, the majority of ozanimod subjects 
evaluable for on-treatment recovery subsequently recovered to ≥ 0.2 x 109/L within 2 weeks. In Pool G, 
the median time to off-treatment recovery of ALC to the normal range (≥ 1 x 109/L) was 35 days (95% CI 
33, 37).  
The decrease in ALC due to ozanimod may increase susceptibility to infections. Consistent with the MS 
program, TEAEs of infections in the UC program were mostly characterized by non-serious infections of 
the upper respiratory tract. In the controlled UC studies, the incidence of serious infections was low in 
both treatment groups and numerically higher in the ozanimod 1 mg compared with the placebo group in 
Pool Fi (0.8% versus 0.4%, respectively) but lower in the ozanimod 1 mg - ozanimod 1 mg treatment 
group compared with the ozanimod 1 mg - placebo group in Pool Fm (0.9% versus 1.8%, respectively). 
Opportunistic infections were more frequent with ozanimod compared with placebo with an incidence of 
2.4% vs. 0.4% (and an IR of 14.8 vs. 8.1, respectively), and were predominantly cases of Herpes zoster. 
Most cases of Herpes zoster with ozanimod in Pool G were mild to moderate (96%) and most subjects 
(88%) continued treatment with ozanimod. Based on the findings from controlled maintenance Pool Fm 
with Herpes zoster being reported in 2.2% of ozanimod vs. 04% placebo subjects, which is also 
consistent with the reporting rate of Herpes zoster in (long-term) Pool G in ozanimod treated subjects of 
2.2%, the Applicant proposes to increase the frequency of Herpes zoster to common in SmPC section 4.8. 
None of the subjects with herpes zoster had an ALC < 2 x 109/L. 
There is a potential risk of malignancies with ozanimod. From the controlled UC program as well as from 
the incidence rates (IR) provided for the overall UC studies no imbalance was found with regard to all 
malignancies and non-cutaneous malignancies, respectively. However, interpretability of controlled 
maintenance (Pool Fm) data with regard to malignancies is limited by the fact, that subjects re-
randomised to placebo were treated with ozanimod for approx. 10 weeks prior to the maintenance study 
phase. Few patients (n=69) in the maintenance part of study 3101 were exclusively treated with placebo 
and no malignancy was observed within this group. However, the extent of safety follow up in this 
subgroup was comparably low and these subjects were not included in Pool Fm. The overall incidence of 
any malignancy as well as colorectal cancer (CRC) malignancies (3 cases in approx. 2000 SY) in the UC 
study program was in the range of epidemiological UC data. Furthermore, no cluster of non-cutaneous 
malignancies or lymphoma was found and there was no apparent increase in IR with greater exposure

duration. Half of the neoplasms reported with ozanimod in UC studies were non-melanoma skin 
malignancies with basal cell carcinoma presenting as the most common skin neoplasm congruent with the 
findings in the MS population. Of note, cutaneous malignancies, i.e. 5 cases (0.4%) of basal cell 
carcinoma and 1 case (< 0.1%) of squamous cell carcinoma solely occurred in ozanimod but not in 
placebo subjects in Pool G.). While there is considerable variability across countries, the IRs of NMSC in 
the UC study program (2.6 for basal cell carcinoma and 0.5 for squamous cell carcinoma, respectively) 
were also generally within the range reported in literature. However, a warning has been introduced in 
section 4.4. 
Overall based on the UC studies, herpes zoster, headache and peripheral oedema ADRs in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC are introduced with a frequency of common.  
As of data-cut off, there were no confirmed cases of PML or cryptococcal meningitis SDEIs in the entire 
ozanimod development program. PML is included as important potential risk in the RMP. 
Similar to what has been found in the MS program, ozanimod led to small reductions in pulmonary 
function tests (mainly FEV1, FVC, and DLCO) in the UC studies. The median change from baseline for FEV 
and FVC was approx. 100 mL in the controlled MS studies and below 100 mL in the controlled UC studies.  
Ozanimod should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as currently stated in section 4.4 of SmPC. 
One case of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) was reported in the MS study 
program. PRES was also found related with S1P receptor modulators. No new case occurred in the UC 
program. 
The receptor affected by ozanimod (Sphingosin-1 Phosphate) is known to be involved in vascular 
formation during embryogenesis and preclinical studies indicate a clear evidence for teratogenicity in 
rodents and non-rodents. Due to the risk to the foetus, ozanimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and 
in women of child-bearing potential not using effective contraception. 
2.12.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The following important potential risks have been derived from the development MS program of 
ozanimod: Symptomatic bradycardia, Severe liver injury, Serious opportunistic infections including 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), Macular oedema, Malignancy, Posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome, Embryofetal toxicity in exposed pregnant females. The safety profile of 
ozanimod resulting from the UC development program appears to be largely similar to that resulting from 
the MS clinical program, however comparability of frequencies of TEAEs across MS and UC studies is 
limited due to differences in study duration and design, which is mainly due to the randomised withdrawal 
design of UC phase 3 study 3101 and the overall shorter controlled observation period in the clinical UC 
studies of a maximum of 52 weeks.  
Available efficacy and safety data in the MS indication in subjects > 55 years is still limited. From the 
provided analyses of safety data in UC subjects by age based on a cut-off age of 40 years and 65 years, 
respectively, no clear indication of a worse safety profile in older patients arises, however, the amount of 
available data is limited. Therefore, caution is advised in UC patients over 65 years and in MS patients 
over 55 years of age. 
There is a potential risk of malignancies with ozanimod. From the controlled UC program as well as from 
the incidence rates (IR) provided for the overall UC studies no clear imbalance was found with regard to 
all malignancies and non-cutaneous malignancies, respectively. However, some imbalance appears to be 
present for cutaneous malignancies which might be considered relevant despite the longer exposure for

patients treated with ozanimod as compared to those treated with placebo. Malignancies typically 
observed with broader immunosuppressive therapies, such as lymphomas, have not been reported with 
ozanimod. Overall, a causal relationship of the malignancies with ozanimod can neither be established nor 
ruled out at present. UC has a disease specific increased risk of colorectal malignancy. Malignancy is 
included as potential risk in the RMP. Active malignancies are a contraindication in section 4.3 of SmPC. 
An increased risk of skin malignancies is labelled for S1P receptor modulators. As such, a dedicated 
section for Cutaneous neoplasms is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. The ongoing long-term studies 
are deemed essential to further address the potential risk of malignancies. 
There appeared some imbalance with regards to SAEs of ischaemic stroke derived from Pool G with an 
incidence of 4 (0.3%) in ozanimod vs. 0 placebo subjects and corresponding IRs per 1000 SY of 2.1 vs. 0, 
respectively which required further clarification. It can be seen that in UC subjects, apart from 
thrombophlebitis, which occurred more frequently in the placebo compared to the ozanimod group, all 
other thromboembolic related events by PT occurred only in the ozanimod 1 mg group but not in the 
placebo group (Pool G). These events comprised ischaemic stroke (IR of 2.1), but also retinal vein 
thrombosis in two cases (IR of 1.0), as well as one case each of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, pulmonary microembolism. Overall, the TE cases observed in Pool G could reflect the generally 
higher incidence of TE in UC patients and do not indicate a clear causal relationship with ozanimod. It is 
thus agreed, that TE is currently not classified as adverse drug reaction. As requested by PRAC, TE has 
been added as an important potential risk in the RMP. To further explore this risk, the Applicant has 
proposed to add the following secondary endpoints to the planned UC post-approval safety study (PASS): 
(1) the subcomponents of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), (specifically, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, nonfatal stroke and cardiac death) and (2) venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary 
embolism). This 10-year study is intended to accumulate long-term data to describe the risk of 
cardiovascular events in the UC ozanimod population.  
Because of the established risk of S1P receptor modulators regarding bradycardia and hypertension, 
respectively, ozanimod is already contraindicated in patients with relevant cardiac conditions including 
unstable angina/MI, stroke/TIA and decompensated heart failure within the previous 6 months, which 
additionally increase the TE risk (beyond UC). No further changes to the SmPC are therefore proposed by 
the Applicant at the present state, which is agreed. However, the Applicant was requested to provide 
review of TE and discuss respective labelling consequences with upcoming PSURs. 
As of safety data cut-off (31 Mar 2020), 14 deaths occurred in the overall ozanimod program across all 
indications, 7 of which have already been assessed during the marketing authorisation procedure for MS. 
While a numerical imbalance of death cases was found in the MS study program (2 death cases in Pool A1 
occurring on ozanimod vs. none on placebo), death cases in the UC indication occurred only during open-
label treatment with ozanimod (N=3). In line with the findings from the death cases reviewed during the 
marketing authorisation of ozanimod for MS, no common pattern could be derived from the additional 
death cases provided with this variation across all indications. Two of the additional cases might involve 
immunosuppressant properties and two cases were reported in the context of malignancies. 
During the controlled maintenance period (Pool Fm), the TEAEs which occurred at a (≥ 1%) higher 
frequency in the ozanimod (ozanimod-ozanimod) compared to the placebo (ozanimod-placebo) group and 
are not yet included in 4.8 of the SmPC were headache (3.5% vs. 0.4%) and oedema peripheral (2.6% 
vs. 0%). In addition, hot flush occurred on Day 1 in 2 ozanimod but no placebo subjects in the UC studies 
(Pool Fi) and occurred in the active controlled phase 3 RMS studies (Pool A1) likewise on Day 1 with 
higher frequency in ozanimod (0.2%) vs. placebo subjects (0.1%).  
Herpes zoster, Headache and peripheral oedema are included as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC as 
appropriate, with a frequency of “common” (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).

2.14.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
2.14.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The induction study demonstrated superiority of ozanimod 1 mg daily compared to placebo in inducing 
remission, improvement of clinical symptoms, and endoscopic improvement, remission, as well as 
histologic remission across a variety of second and third line patients. Consistent results were shown for 
patients with and without corticosteroid treatment and with and without previous anti-TNF treatment. A 
high consistency of results was shown both across endpoints as well as patient subgroups, and analysis 
methods. 
The maintenance study demonstrated a similar superiority of ozanimod 1 mg once daily compared to 
placebo in maintaining remission up until week 52. Similar to the induction phase, all results were 
consistent across subgroups, different endpoints, and types of analysis. 
Overall, the data presented in the application support the proposed indication and dosing 
recommendations in the SmPC. The oral formulation may also be an advantage, since, besides tofacitinib, 
all currently available antibody-based biologics for the treatment of UC are administered parenterally.  
The safety database for ozanimod in the UC indication is considered comprehensive with more than 4057 
subjects exposed across all indications and 1158 exposed UC subjects. 716 UC subjects have been 
treated for at least 12 months and 322 for at least 24 months. The currently available safety profile in UC 
subjects is qualitatively largely in line with that established for the MS indication. Although comparability 
of incidences of AEs across MS and UC studies is limited due to differences in study durations and 
designs, the most relevant safety findings with ozanimod in the UC indication occurred with general 
similar frequency, i.e. heart rate decreases, blood pressure changes, liver enzyme increases, macular 
oedema, pulmonary function decrease, CTCAE Grade 4 ALC reductions, infections, and malignancies.   
There is a potential risk of malignancies with ozanimod. From the controlled UC program as well as from 
the incidence rates (IR) provided for the overall UC studies no clear imbalance was found with regard to 
all malignancies and non-cutaneous malignancies, respectively. However, some imbalance could be 
detected for cutaneous malignancies. Malignancies typically observed with broader immunosuppressive 
therapies, such as lymphomas, have not been reported with ozanimod. Nevertheless, a causal 
relationship can neither be established nor ruled out based on available clinical data. Therefore, the 
ongoing long-term studies are deemed essential to address the potential risk of malignancies.  
In the controlled UC studies, the incidence of serious infections was low in both treatment groups and 
while numerically slightly higher with ozanimod compared to placebo group during the pooled induction 
period, the risk was somewhat lower in subjects with continued ozanimod treatment vs. subjects re-
randomised to placebo during the maintenance phase. Opportunistic infections were more frequent with 
ozanimod compared to placebo and were predominantly cases of Herpes zoster. Most cases of Herpes 
zoster in the UC studies were mild to moderate (96%) and most subjects (88%) continued treatment 
with ozanimod. None of the subjects with herpes zoster had an ALC reduction < 2 x 109/L. As of the 
current safety data cut-off for the current submission (31 Mar 2020), there were no confirmed cases of 
PML or cryptococcal meningitis SDEIs in the entire ozanimod development program. However, the 
diagnosis of a definitive PML case has meanwhile been reported in a patient with RRMS under treatment 
with ozanimod, which will be addressed in a dedicated type II variation to update the PI and RMP (if 
needed) on the risk of PML. 
Overall, based on the UC studies, herpes zoster, headache and peripheral oedema ADRs in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC are introduced with a frequency of common.  
Assessment report  
EMA/619305/2021 
Page 206/209 
 
 
 
 
Long-term safety data are still limited, as open-label extension studies RPC01-3001 in MS as well as 
RPC01-3102 in UC are still ongoing.  
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  ozanimod  in  UC  patients  is  considered  manageable  with  appropriate  risk 
minimisation measures. The Applicant has agreed and committed to further evaluations of the newly added 
important potential risk of thromboembolic events.  
2.15.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The applicant has provided a clear and convincing evidence of efficacy for the treatment of ulcerative 
colitis, both in the short-term, as well as in long-term treatment. The benefits of treatment have been 
demonstrated both at the level of improvement of symptoms (mainly diarrhoea and blood in stools), and 
well as on the signs relevant for the long-term prognosis, such as endoscopic improvement, mucosal 
healing, and histological remission. Therefore, benefits have been convincingly shown for the subjective 
well-being of patients, as well as for the inflammatory process in the colonic mucosa. While in the short 
term, the rate of full remission of patients remains modest (but is still relevantly higher than under 
treatment with placebo) a relevant rate of remission can be achieved with long-term treatment once an 
initial response has been achieved and the rate of patients remaining in remission, once this has been 
achieved is considered similarly relevant. 
The safety profile of ozanimod in the UC population is overall in line with the safety profile established in 
the MS indication. Ozanimod belongs to the class of S1P receptor modulators, the first of which (fingolimod) 
was approved approx. 10 years ago in the European Union and for which risk minimisation measures proved 
efficacious.  The  safety  issues  concerning  ozanimod  are  considered  manageable.  Current  uncertainties 
mainly pertain to the safety profile with long-term concomitant corticosteroids, the limited safety data in 
older subjects as well as a potential rebound phenomenon. The determination of the long-term safety risk 
is  still  outstanding  and  will  be  further  addressed  in  ongoing  long-term  open-label  studies  3102  (UC 
indication) and 3001 (MS indication). 
2.16.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zeposia for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active 
ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either 
conventional therapy or a biologic agent is positive.

2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
Pegunigalsidase alfa (also referred to as PRX-102) is a form of human α-galactosidase-A (α-Gal-A), produced 
in tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum BY2 cells) using recombinant DNA technology. which has been chemically 
modified by short (2.3 KDa) bis-NHS-PEG reagents to provide PEGylated monomers, the majority of which are 
cross-linked to give covalently bound homodimer molecules through PEG chains. It is a product intended for 
the treatment of adult patients with Fabry disease.
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Fabry disease is a debilitating progressive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by subnormal or absent 
activity of alpha-galactosidase A, a lysosomal enzyme that primarily catalyses the hydrolysis of the glycolipid 
globotriaosylceramide, Gb3, to galactose and lactosylceramide.
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Fabry disease is an X-linked disorder caused by alterations in the gene that encodes the enzyme α-GAL-A (GLA) 
leading  to  deficient/absent  enzymatic  activity  and  resulting  in  glycosphingolipid  accumulation  with  life-
threatening complications [Ortiz 2018]. It is regarded as a rare disease and it was originally estimated that 1 
in 40,000 males has the disease, whereas the estimated prevalence in the general population was 1 in 117,000 
[Meikle 1999]. However, newer studies suggest that Fabry disease has a much higher prevalence following the 
development  of  better  diagnostic  tools  and  increasing  awareness  [Hoffmann  2009].  Due  to  the  nonspecific 
nature of the clinical manifestations of Fabry disease and the common occurrence of a single complication, it 
is likely that many undiagnosed patients exist, which explains the discrepancy in frequency. 
Furthermore, the presence of equal numbers of females and males in large populations studied suggests that 
up to 50% of the females with Fabry disease may not have been identified [Eng 2007; Mehta 2004]. An α-
GAL-A enzyme activity screening of 37,104 consecutive newborn males confirmed by sequencing of genomic 
DNA  indicated  the  prevalence  for  Fabry  Disease  in  Italy  to  be  1  in  3,100  males  [Spada  2006].  This  study 
identified and included often undiagnosed patients with the non-classic form of Fabry disease; the ratio of non-
classic to classic was determined to be 11 to 1 [Spada 2006]. A random screening of 110,027 newborns in 
Taiwan discovered the incidence in males to be about 1 in 1,500 [Lin 2009]. This study also determined there

were still significantly fewer females affected than males, with approximately 1 in 17,000 affected; however, 
this  prevalence  is  still  much  higher  than  was  previously  thought  for  males  [Lin  2009].  Screening  for  Fabry 
disease  reveals  a  high  prevalence  of  individuals  with  GLA  genetic  variants  of  unknown  significance.  The 
prevalence  of  GLA  variants  in  newborns  was  found  to  be  0.04%,  while  in  high-risk  populations,  the  overall 
prevalence of individuals with GLA variants was 0.62%, with the prevalence of a definite diagnosis of Fabry 
disease as 0.12% [van der Tol 2016].  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis
Fabry disease is characterised by mutations in the GLA gene, resulting in decreased/undetectable levels of α-
Gal-A activity in plasma or leukocytes, typically observed together, with high concentrations of the substrate 
Gb3 and its degradation product, Lyso-Gb3 in tissues and plasma, which both correlate with organ damage 
[Aerts 2008; Boutin 2014; Ouyang 2017; Kramer 2018].  
Progressive accumulation of Gb3, Lyso-Gb3, and related lipids, leads to impaired tissue and organ function, 
particularly  in  the  kidney,  heart,  and  cerebrovascular  system  [Aerts  2008;  Schiffmann  2009].  In  addition, 
involvement of the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems result in episodes of pain and impaired 
peripheral sensation. 
A  recent  review  by  Kramer  and  Weidmann  surveyed  70  peer-reviewed  publications  regarding  Fabry  specific 
biomarkers and identified Lyso-Gb3 as a biomarker with clinical applicability. Reductions of plasma Lyso-Gb3 
were found to be indicative of treatment response, i.e., of ERT performance [Kramer 2018]. Furthermore, when 
ADAs to ERT form, they decrease the ability of ERT to reduce plasma Lyso-Gb3 concentration [Sakuraba 2018; 
Mauhin 2018; Rombach 2012].  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis
Fabry disease is typically categorised using two subtypes, classic and non-classic, based on age of symptom 
onset and extent of organ involvement. Clinical onset of the classic form of disease typically occurs during 
childhood or adolescence [Schaefer 2009] and progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiac 
complications, and/or cerebrovascular disease in the fourth or fifth decade of life [Branton 2002]. Non-
classical Fabry disease, also referred to as late-onset or atypical disease, is characterised by a more variable 
disease course, in which patients are generally less severely affected and disease manifestations may be 
limited to a single organ. Males with nonclassical disease typically have >5% residual enzyme activity and 
lower levels of the deacetylated substrate [Lyso-Gb3; Arends 2017].  
Classic Fabry Disease 
The discussion and parameters regarding the definition of a classic Fabry disease patient is evolving and, in 
some cases, challenging. Currently, there is no consensus in the published literature regarding the definition 
of classic Fabry disease in either males or females [Arends 2017; van der Tol 2014; Mehta 2002; Smid 2013; 
Chien 2012; Nakao 2003; Salviati 2010]. Patients were considered to be classic when the following criteria 
were met: (1) a GLA disease-causing mutation, (2) enzyme activity ≤5% of the mean reference range, and 
(3) one or more characteristic Fabry disease symptoms (i.e., Fabry neuropathic pain, angiokeratoma, and/or 
cornea verticillata). 
Disease Manifestation in Males 
Primary clinical manifestations of Fabry Disease in males are neuropathic pain and acroparaesthesia; 
angiokeratomas; hypohidrosis; cornea verticillata; hearing loss; and gastrointestinal symptoms. Renal

disease is associated with progressive proteinuria accompanied by a decline in eGFR, leading over a number 
of years to ESRD requiring dialysis and/or kidney transplantation [Branton 2002; Ortiz 2008]. There is 
evidence that hyperfiltration often precedes the decline in renal function, particularly in childhood; 
hyperfiltration will present as greater than normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) but represents 
evolving glomerulopathy [Ries 2005; Vedder 2007]. 
Cardiac disease is associated with progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, a 
variety of conduction defects and arrhythmias such as short P–R interval, and supraventricular and 
ventricular tachycardia. Other complications are valvular disease (insufficiency or stenosis) and coronary 
artery stenosis of large or, more commonly, of small vessels [Kampmann 2008; Weidemann 2005]. 
Progressive bradycardia and decreased exercise capacity are also very common [Lobo 2008].  
It has been estimated that patients with Fabry disease have a 20-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke and 
transient ischemic attacks compared to the general population. Both small and large vessel strokes occur, 
with brain regions perfused by the posterior circulation being affected more commonly than anterior 
circulation [Moore 2001; Moore 2003]. 
Manifestation in Females 
Due to the X-linked nature of the disease, males are hemizygotes and females are heterozygotes and 
affected by the mosaicism effect [Hughes 2011]. It is now widely accepted that females may express a range 
of clinical features including life-threatening manifestations such as cardiomyopathy, renal disease and stroke 
[MacDermot 2001; Whybra 2009; Sunder-Plassmann 2006]. There is considerable variation in the phenotype 
in heterozygous females. Age has the strongest correlation with the presence of symptoms, with the 
proportion of women suffering from a particular symptom manifesting approximately a decade after that 
symptom is found in males. The median age of onset of symptoms is 13 years in female as compared to 9 
years in males [Hughes 2011]. Only 7.6% of females were diagnosed prior to symptom onset, largely due to 
screening of families. Forty-three percent (43%) of diagnosed females are receiving ERT with median age of 
initiation of 44.8 years. 
2.1.5.  Management
There are currently two approved classes of therapies available for patients with Fabry disease, ERT (Fabrazyme 
and Replagal) and pharmacological chaperone (Galafold). 
Fabrazyme  (agalsidase  beta  1.0  mg/kg  EOW)  and  Replagal  (agalsidase  alfa  0.2  mg/kg  EOW)  are  ERTs 
authorised in the EU and administered by IV infusion. ERT is the longest and most successfully employed drug 
treatment for lysosomal storage disorders indicated across the entire spectrum of disease-causing mutations.  
Both enzymes have shown effects in clinical studies with regard to the preservation of renal function [Hughes 
2017; Vedder 2007; Banikazemi 2007; Eng 2001; Ortiz 2021; Wanner 2020; Germain 2007; Germain 2010; 
Germain  2016;  Mehta  2010;  Wilcox  2004;  Schiffmann  2006;  Schiffmann  2009].    In  addition,  some

Galafold (migalastat) is the only approved molecular chaperone and is only effective for a subgroup of ~30% 
of Fabry disease patients with amenable mutations. Galafold is approved in the United States, European Union 
and other countries based on reduction of renal Gb3 inclusions. 
2.2.  About the product
Pegunigalsidase alfa is a recombinant human α-Gal-A produced in cultured tobacco (BY2) cells and PEGylated 
to  become  a  covalently  linked  homodimer.  The  production  in  plant  cells  results  in  mannose  terminated 
glycosylation [Kizhner 2015] that targets pegunigalsidase alfa to disease-relevant tissues, and the PEGylation 
is  claimed  to  decrease  the  immunogenicity  and  further  enhance  enzyme  exposure  to  target  organs,  thus 
improving PK properties.
Pegunigalsidase alfa is categorised as an ERT to supplement biological active α-GAL-A enzyme to Fabry disease 
patients characterised by deficient/absent enzyme activity. This deficiency/absence results in massive storage 
of Gb3 and related glycolipids (e.g., Lyso-Gb3) in cells of the vascular system, cardiomyocytes, neuronal cells 
and  kidney  cells  as  well  as  elevated  levels  in  the  circulation.  The  ultimate  consequence  of  glycosphingolipid 
deposition in the vasculature and other tissues is end-organ failure, particularly of the kidney, but also of the 
cardiac and cerebrovascular system [Schiffmann 2009].

Figure 1 Pegunigalsidase alfa amino acid sequence
The majority of pegylated prh-alpha-GAL-A monomers are cross-linked to a covalently bound homodimer, 
some of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties are bound to one monomer only. Pegunigalsidase alfa 
contains also noncovalently bound homodimers when no crosslinking occurs. All covalently and non-
covalently bound pegylated homodimers are biologically active. In addition, biologically active tetramers, i.e., 
two homodimers are also found.
The theoretical molecular weight is 46,110 Da. The molecular weight of pegunigalsidase homodimer 
comprising two pegylated alpha-GAL-A subunits is approximately 116 kDa. 
The pegylation is achieved with a bis-NHS-PEG reagent (NHS represents N-hydroxysuccinimide) containing 
amino-groups substituted with succinic acid, yielding a crosslinker with an average total mass of 2300 Da. An 
average of 8-9 PEG moieties are reported per monomer.
To be biologically active, pegunigalsidase is internalized to lysosomes where it hydrolyses terminal alpha-
galactosyl moieties from the glycolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) to yield galactose and lactosylceramide. 
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls
The active substance is manufactured at Protalix Ltd, Israel. A valid GMP certificate is available.
Recombinant pegunigalsidase alfa active substance is manufactured using a genetically modified Tobacco BY-
2 plant cell line. The manufacturing process includes an upstream (“production train”) and downstream 
purification processing stepsError! Reference source not found.
Upstream processing starts with the thaw of working cell bank (WCB) and cell expansion through petri 
dishes, shake flasks and bioreactors of increasing size. The cell content of “inoculum” bioreactors, are used 
for biomass production for inoculation of the “induction” bioreactors. 
The cells in the “induction” bioreactors express the prh alpha-GAL-A protein. The pooled harvests of 
bioreactors are separated and the soluble prh alpha-GAL-A protein is extracted and clarified by filtration and 
purification using chromatographic columns to produce the intermediate, non-pegylated product designated 
as BCL (Before Cross Link). The BCL intermediate may be stored at adequate conditions. 
Downstream process continues with thawing BCL intermediate batches to conduct the chemical cross-link 
reaction. The bifunctional crosslinking reagent N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester activated PEG (Bis-NHS-PEG)  is 
used to generate pegylated prh alpha-GAL-A protein. To purify the cross-linked prh alpha-GAL-A protein, a 
final chromatographic column is used, which is followed by compounding to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL

2Control of materials
Information on grade and quality of the raw materials used during upstream/downstream processing is 
acceptable. The composition of culture media is described. Filter and resin types as well as buffer 
compositions are listed in the dossier. No raw materials of direct animal or human origin are used during the 
manufacturing process. 
The generation of the cell substrate is described in detail. A plant cell line, Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bright 
Yellow 2 (BY2) was chosen for transformation with the human alpha-GAL-A transgene.  The generation of the 
cell banks is described. The master cell bank (MCB) and WCB were characterised by testing for sterility, cell 
viability, cell growth at harvest, alpha GAL-A protein expression. In general characterisation for MCB/WCB is 
considered acceptable. Additional information on identity testing as well as genetic stability testing to confirm 
insert coding sequence in the WCB and/or the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) cells is provided. The 
procedures for preparing a new WCB as well as the requirements for its characterisation are described and 
considered acceptable. 
Nucleic acid sequencing of the alpha-Gal-A insert in cells cultured up to the LIVCA under conditions 
representative for the manufacturing scale are provided to demonstrate stability up to the maximum harvest 
culture time. Calculation of the maximum culture duration claimed for the LIVCA is described and is 
considered adequate.

Control of critical steps and intermediates
Acceptable process parameter and controls including process parameter (PP) and critical process parameter 
(CPP) as well as process indicators (PI) and in-process controls (IPC) are implemented together with their 
acceptance criteria (Normal Operating Range, NOR). Proven acceptable ranges (PAR) are provided as well.
Acceptable bioburden and endotoxin control is integrated in both upstream and downstream procedures. Both 
process-related and product-related in-process controls have been established for the downstream 
procedure. The critical steps as well as the control parameter for pegunigalsidase alfa active substance 
manufacturing process have been defined using a risk mitigation approach. This is considered acceptable.
Overall, well-structured information has been provided for the active substance manufacturing process and 
its control. The provided batch definition is considered reasonable. 
BCL (before cross linking) intermediate
An acceptable specification has been provided for BCL intermediateError! Reference source not found.. 
Analytical procedures included in the BCL intermediate specification are adequately described and respective 
method validation data are considered appropriate. 
Activated PEG intermediate 
In the initial submission activated PEG intermediate was classified as starting material. However, PEG should 
be classified as a starting material and the activated PEG moiety should be defined as intermediate, as the 
activation of PEG is considered part of the manufacturing process. A major objection was raised on this point. 
As requested, activated PEG has subsequently been re-classified as an intermediate, while the PEG used to 
produce the activated PEG has been classified as a starting material. Appropriate and sufficient information is 
provided with regard to the PEG starting material, the manufacturing process and its control as well as 
process-related impurities. Necessary controls have been implemented into the activated PEG specification. 
Acceptable description and qualification of analytical test methods used for control of activated PEG 
intermediate is provided as well as stability data supporting the assigned shelf life. Moreover, it is confirmed 
that the PEG is processed to activated PEG under GMP conditions. Since the PEG intermediate is a chemically 
defined material, this is considered appropriate.
1Process validation
Process verification has been performed by manufacture of batches of BCL intermediate originating from 
different “production trains” with active substance batches. All were manufactured with the commercial scale 
and process.  
Process validation/process performance qualification (PPQ) studies have been performed. The choice of 
batches and overall setting for process verification seems reasonable.
Generally, all input and output parameters including PPs, CPPs, PI and IPCs met the pre-defined acceptance 
criteria and based on that, in general, the active substance manufacturing process can be considered in a 
validated state. In few cases, input and output parameter were found deviating from pre-defined acceptance 
criteria. After root cause analysis, acceptance criteria have been updated which is covered by GMP. 
Resin lifetime of the chromatography columns used during the active substance manufacturing process has 
been defined. For resin lifetime evaluation at commercial scale, acceptable protocols are provided.

During active substance manufacture, a number of disposable bags and bioreactors are used. Risk 
assessment is performed to investigate potential extractables and leachables in the active substance. 
However, the analytical investigation on leachables was conducted at the finished product level. 
Manufacturing process development
Development of pegunigalsidase alfa manufacturing process was performed at Protalix Ltd., Israel using a 
proprietary bioreactor system and plant cell technology and taking into consideration prior knowledge gained 
for Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa). 
Different manufacturing processes phases have been described. In general, the differences between the 
process phases have been described with sufficient detail. Comparability between the different process 
materials has been adequately addressed with reference to release and stability data available for BCL 
intermediate and active substance. Overall, comparable data are available for the quality attributes of the 
pre-change and post-change materials including the commercial process material demonstrating 
representativeness of the clinical materials for the commercial scale materials. 
To manufacture pegunigalsidase alfa active substance, critical quality attributes were identified and a process 
control strategy was developed. Implementation of the control strategy seems reasonable and is considered 
acceptable. Classification of process input and process output parameter into critical process parameter 
(CPP)/ IPCs and other process parameter (PP)/ process indicators (PI) is considered adequate. Proven 
acceptable ranges for process parameter have been confirmed using lab-scale, pilot-scale and commercial 
scale studies challenging the edges of PAR(s). The applied small-scale models seem representative for the 
commercial scale since operating parameter were kept the same. Parameters that were found to critically 
affect either process performance or product quality were defined as CPP. This is considered acceptable.
The process step of PEG cross linking and its development/optimisation is specifically addressed. 
Crosslinking using a bis-pegylating reagent aims to increase active substance stability and thus to retain 
enzymatic activity. In the course of development, different pegylation reagents with different qualities have 
been used to produce pre-clinical, clinical and commercial batches. The impact of these quality differences on 
the resulting active substance batches used during pre-clinical studies, clinical studies and for commercial 
manufacture has been evaluated. Effectivity of the PEG crosslinking is adequately monitored by appropriate 
techniques.  
The presented data support comparability of the active substance materials manufactured with different 
pegylation reagents of different qualities. Likewise, the presented data support the Applicant’s conclusion that 
the impact of these quality differences on the resulting active substance batches used during pre-clinical 
studies, clinical studies and for commercial manufacture can be neglected.
Characterisation
Pegunigasidase alfa is a complex molecule, consisting of the homodimeric protein part of alpha galactosidase. 
The structure was adequately characterised and confirmed and the biological activity adequately studied and 
demonstrated as well.
In conclusion, the active substance has been sufficiently characterised.

Impurities
The Applicant provided a very comprehensive evaluation of impurities (potentially) present in pegunigalsidase 
active substance. Evaluation included an assessment where impurities originate from, capability of analytical 
methods to detect such impurities, and clearance studies for the process-related impurities at different 
scales. Forced degradation studies were performed to identify degradation products and elucidate 
degradation pathways. Further, these studies supported the stability indicating potential of the analytical 
methods used.
Impurity levels have been qualified by nonclinical and clinical studies as relevant.
Product-related impurities were already extensively discussed in the characterisation section. They are 
addressed by suitable methods; for some of them specifications are established in the active substance 
specification. 
For evaluation of process-related impurities, sufficient clearance to acceptable levels could be demonstrated.
The clearance capability of the manufacturing process was repeated at production scale (where no spiking is 
intended) to support robustness of the process. Worst case conditions were chosen where deemed valuable. 
Similarly, it could be demonstrated that the process is capable to reduce impurities to either insignificant 
levels or to levels well within the proposed limit specification at release of intermediate/active substance.
Forced degradation studies were conducted to analyse the effects of stress on product degradation and to 
identify and evaluate degradation kinetics and pathways. The study design comprised several levels where 
batches, stress conditions, and methods to analyse degradation were varied. 
Overall, valuable information on degradation, degradation pathways and reaction kinetics was obtained by 
the various forced degradation studies performed. Thus, the forced degradation studies further enlarged 
understanding of the quality profile of the active substance.
2.4.2.3.  Specification
Active substance
The release and shelf-life specifications for pegunigalsidase alfa active substance 2cover tests for appearance, 
content and potency, identity, purity and impurities, and general tests.
2In general, an acceptable specification has been provided for the pegunigalsidase active substance. It 
comprises acceptance criteria for appearance, protein content by UV280 absorbance and determination of 
enzyme activity using enzyme-substrate in vitro test as well as potency testing using cellular uptake assay. 
Identity is determined using peptide map, SDS-PAGE/ Western Blot and molecular weight analysis. Purity is 
controlled by SE-HPLC (denaturing and non-denaturing), peptide map (RP-HPLC), free sulfhydryl content, 
amine site occupancy and total PEG content. pH, total aerobic count and bacterial endotoxins are controlled 
as general tests. 
The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. 
Analytical methods
Detailed descriptions of analytical methods have been provided for the release methods as well as the 
respective method codes. Analytical method validation summaries provided are found acceptable.

Reference materials
Reference standards have been established for control of BCL intermediate and for control of active 
substance/finished product. Qualification of reference standards used in the past is described in sufficient 
detail. For the commercial process, a primary reference standard as well as working reference standard have 
been established for the BCL intermediate and for the active substance. 
Qualification of reference standards has been performed based on release testing and additional 
characterisation. This is considered acceptable.
For establishment and qualification of future working standards, acceptable protocols have been provided. 
Stability of reference standard materials is also appropriately addressed.
Batch analysis 
An extensive release data base is available, including batch information for all active substance batches 
manufactured so far. Generally, batch data are found complying with the specification being in place at the 
time of analysis.
Container closure
Sufficient information has been provided on the container closure system used for active substance storage. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability
A comprehensive data package is provided for stability. Primary stability studies cover commercial active 
substance batches and supportive stability studies cover active substance batches manufactured with 
previous process versions. 
The primary stability studies were performed in line with ICH guidelines and covered long-term conditions 
and accelerated conditions. The supportive stability studies also include storage under stress conditions. 
Forced-degradation studies are described in the characterisation section.
The only differences in the stability specification compared to the release specification are skipped 
parameters and slightly extended limits for one impurity parameter. The analytical procedures applied to 
testing of the stability samples are identical to those used for release. 
Overall, the stability protocol is acceptable and the chosen analytical procedures are considered stability-
indicating. The container closure system used for the stability studies is a smaller size but intended to mimic 
the commercial container closure system.
The stability data demonstrate the active substance being stable under the proposed storage conditions. All 
parameters remain within the pre-defined specification limits. 
Accelerated stability data is available for all primary stability batches. All parameters remain well within the 
specifications throughout the duration of the stability studies.

The finished product is presented in 10 mL vial (15R clear glass) vials as concentrate for solution for infusion. 
The vials are closed with coated rubber stoppers and secured with aluminium flip off caps.
Vials are filled with a sterile citrate buffered solution (pH 5.9-6.4) of 2 mg/mL pegunigalsidase alfa containing 
0.7% sodium chloride. The nominal quantity is 20 mg of pegunigalsidase alfa based on an extractable volume 
of 10 mL per vial. There is an overfill to facilitate extraction of the declared volume.
Prior to administration, the required amount of pegunigalsidase alfa finished product is added to the infusion 
bag containing sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered via IV infusion. The diluent is not 
accompanying the finished product.
The components of the finished product are Pegunigalsidase alfa, Sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, Citric 
acid, Sodium chloride. Error! Reference source not found.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product was based on a quality target product profile 
(QTPP). Formulation and manufacturing process development took into account the applicable critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) for a sterile solution in vials. 
The pegunigalsidase alfa active substance is an aqueous solution containing 2 mg/mL of pegunigalsidase alfa 
in sodium citrate buffer with sodium chloride. The finished product is a concentrate for solution for infusion 
with a physiologically compatible pH (5.9 – 6.4) and osmolality.
Formulation development started based on existing formulations for commercial enzyme replacement 
products. Lyophilization and liquid formulations were evaluated. The lyophilized formulation was significantly 
less stable than liquid formulations and was not pursued further. Liquid formulations with different excipients 
were evaluated resulting in a formulation used for non-clinical trials. 
Changes brought throughout the finished product development were adequately described by the Applicant. 
Subsequent development led to the final clinical formulation that is stored at 2 °C to 8 °C. 
Finished product with active substance manufactured from different processes was used in clinical trials 
phase 1/2 and 3.
Comparability is discussed in the active substance section.
The finished product manufacturing process comprises pooling of active substance, pre-filtration, sterile 
filtration, aseptic filling, stoppering and crimping of the vials. The Applicant considers the manufacturing 
process a straightforward process with no need to perform process development, which is accepted. A 
summary of the risk assessment for defining non-CPPs, CPPs and IPCs of the finished product manufacturing 
process is provided including justification for all acceptance criteria and PARs.

A risk assessment and corresponding studies on potential leachables and elemental impurities from the 
manufacturing process equipment and container closure system in the finished product are presented. One 
batch manufactured at worst case conditions was tested. All leachables and elemental impurities above the 
analytical evaluation threshold (AET) were evaluated. This approach is considered acceptable. 
The applicant provided a toxicological evaluation of the results of potential leachables identified above the 
AET and concluded that no potential harm is expected from the identified compounds at the levels detected. 
The evaluation is accepted. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D (R1). Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no 
risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.
Analytical methods
Finished product specific test procedures are sufficiently described and validated (in-house procedures) or 
verified (compendial procedures). 
Reference materials
The same reference standards are used for both active substance and finished product. Reference is therefore 
made to the active substance section.
Batch analysis
Release results for batches of finished product have been provided covering clinical and PPQ lots 
manufactured with the commercial process. Based on the batch results it can be concluded that the 
manufacturing process is under control and results in consistent and uniform finished product. 
2.4.3.2.  Stability of the product
Primary stability batches of finished product have been included in the current stability study. The stability 
studies are carried out in accordance with ICH Q1A (R2).
The shelf-life specification evolved over time, the rationale for the changes is given. The test methods used 
are the same as those used for release of finished product.
The primary stability batches are stable under long-term conditions for 48 months with all results within the 
specification limits and no significant trend. 
Stability data of the primary stability batches at accelerated storage conditions are within specifications over 
the studied time period showing only a trend towards a slight decrease in homodimer content.

Data from supportive stability batches are in accordance with the stability data of the primary stability 
batches. 
A photostability study in accordance with ICH Q1B demonstrated that the finished product is not susceptible 
to light. Furthermore, the applicant demonstrated that short-term thermal excursions (up to 25 °C or down 
to -20 °C) from the recommended storage conditions (2-8°C) have no negative impact on finished product 
quality.
The applicant also performed a mechanical stress study to evaluate the impact of agitation of the finished 
product. Samples were subjected to vertical and horizontal agitation over 7 days. The study showed that 
mechanical stress leads to large protein aggregates which can be observed visually. Furthermore, the number 
of subvisible particles increases. These findings are appropriately reflected in the SmPC: “Visually inspect the 
vials. […] Do not use if there is particulate matter or if it is discoloured. Avoid shaking or agitating the vials.” 
Furthermore, the diluted finished product should be administered via IV infusion filtered through an in-line 
low protein-binding 0.2 μm filter.
As part of an in-use study after dilution of the finished product with 0.9% NaCl solution the applicant 
demonstrated that the application of an in-line low protein binding 0.2 µm filter does not significantly impact 
appearance, specific activity and protein content of the diluted finished product solution. The in-use study 
also demonstrated that the diluted finished product solution in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and non-PVC infusion 
bags is stable for up to 72 hours at 5±3 °C and at 25±2 °C. For microbiological reasons the in-use stability is 
reduced in the SmPC:
“From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-
use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be 
longer than 24 hours in the refrigerator (2 °C-8 °C) or 8 hours if stored below 25 °C, unless dilution has 
taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.”
Altogether, the proposed shelf-life of the finished product of 4 years at 2-8°C is acceptable.
2.4.3.3.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) has been provided. Overall, the PACMP is sufficiently 
detailed and is therefore considered acceptable.
2.4.3.4.  Adventitious agents
No animal-derived materials are used during manufacturing. The production cell line is of plant origin 
(Nicotiana tabacum). Extensive testing by PCR for viruses with the potential to infect tobacco plants has been 
performed on MCB/WCB, demonstrating that the cell substrate is free from the tested viruses. The 
information provided is considered sufficient to demonstrate viral safety of the cell substrate.  As requested 
the applicant has clarified that there is no risk of accidental introduction of plant viruses during 
manufacturing, as plant cell infection relies on transmission by a (insect) vector. Furthermore spreading of 
plant viruses is hampered due to the disruption of plasmodemata (naturally connecting cytoplasma of 
adjacent cells) in in vitro cultured cells.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of

important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.
The starting material to manufacture the activated pegylating reagent has been re-defined as requested. The 
Major Objection raised in relation to this point has been appropriately solved. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral safety.
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
The toxicology program for pegunigalsidase alfa was conducted in accordance with the International Conference 
on Harmonisation (ICH) M3 (R2) guideline for nonclinical safety studies to support clinical trials as well as the 
ICH S6  (R1) guidance for biotechnology-derived products. Other  relevant ICH  guidelines that were followed 
included: ICH S3A for toxicokinetics and ICH S5 (R2) for reproductive toxicity.
The  pivotal  studies  (chronic  toxicity  in  two  species  and  reproductive  toxicity  including  fertility  and  early 
embryonic development and embryofetal development) complied with Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs).
2.5.2.  Pharmacology
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The primary pharmacodynamics of pegunigalsidase alfa has been investigated in vitro and in vivo and some 
properties have been compared with the unmodified plant cell expressed α-GAL-A (BCL) and the two marketed 
commercial products: agalsidase alfa (Replagal) and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme).
Michaelis–Menten analysis demonstrated that pegunigalsidase alfa is able to hydrolyze synthetic substrate (p-
nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside) of α-Gal-A at higher rate (KM= 2.64 mM) to agalsidase alfa (KM=5.80 mM) 
and agalsidase beta (KM=5.71 mM), indicating that the chemical modification had no negative effects on the 
hydrolisis kinetic parameters. Pegunigalsidase alfa also demonstrated the ability to hydrolyze the semi-natural 
substrate Gb3- NBD of α-Gal-A (KM= 28.5 µM).
Covalent  dimerization  of  α-Gal-A  also  resulted  in  significant  increased  stability  in  plasma  and  under  acidic 
lysosomal-like  conditions  if  compared  with  unmodified  plant  cell  expressed  α-GAL-A  (BCL)  and  other 
commercial products (Replagal and Fabrazyme).
In  an  in  vitro  study  using  skin  fibroblasts  from  two  Fabry  patients,  pegunigalsidase  alfa  was  shown  to  be 
internalized and localized to the lysosome, the sub-cellular target for the enzyme.
Using an animal model of Fabry disease (Fabry mice), pegunigalsidase alfa reached major target organs in the 
treatment of Fabry disease (skin, heart and kidney), as well as liver and spleen, and reduced the accumulation 
of  Gb3  in  all  tested  organs  after  single  and  repeated  administrations  (once  every  2 weeks  for  a  total  of  6 
injections) as follows: skin>heart>kidney. Pegunigalsidase alfa showed higher activity levels and longer activity

duration in the heart, kidney and spleen in comparison with BCL or Replagal (agalsidase alfa). However,the 
activity of pegunigalsidase alfa and Replagal (agalsidase alfa) were similar and slightly higher than that of BCL 
in heart and spleen and no significant differences were observed in liver and kidney. In the liver, the levels of 
pegunigalsidase alfa were lower than for Replagal (agalsidase alfa) and slightly higher than for the BCL. In a 
third  Fabry  mouse  study,  pegunigalsidase  alfa  produced  statistically  significant  improvements  in  functional 
activity (nociceptive response to heat) and decreases in inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia as compared 
to  untreated  mice;  meanwhile  minimal  effects  were  noted  with  Replagal  (agalsidase  alfa)  or  Fabrazyme 
(agalsidase beta).
In vivo studies demonstrated that 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg of pegunigalsidase alfa may provide a protective effect 
in mice model of Fabry disease, but different doses were not directly compared in pharmacology studies. This 
fact limits finding the proper dose in humans. At this time of the clinical development, it is considered acceptable 
to address this issue with clinical data and additional non-clinical studies are not warranted.
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
No secondary pharmacology studies on pegunigalsidase alfa were performed, which is considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme
No formal safety pharmacology studies have been conducted on pegunigalsidase alfa, but relevant information 
is available from the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant 26-week repeat-dose toxicity studies performed 
in mice and monkeys.
Transient  clinical  signs  such  as  decreased  activity  in  monkeys  and  mice;  dyspnoea  cyanosis  and  abdominal 
position  in  mice  and  red  discoloration  of  the  face  in  monkeys  were  observed  in  association  with  the 
administration of pegunigalsidase alfa and were considered to be related to an allergic-type response. No effects 
of pegunigalsidase alfa were noted on the cardiovascular system or respiratory system in mice and monkeys.
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
No drug interaction studies have been conducted on pegunigalsidase alfa. This was considered acceptable since 
on pegunigalsidase alfa is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide hydrolysis, 
thus unlikely to be candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions.
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics
The toxicokinetics of pegunigalsidase alfa has been evaluated in mice and monkeys as well as pregnant rats 
and rabbits. 
Methods used to detect pegunigalsidase alfa in plasma of mice, monkeys, rats and rabbits, and IgG antibodies 
to pegunigalsidase alfa in mice and monkey serum were adequately validated.
At the same mg/kg doses, similar Cmax values were measured in mice, monkeys and pregnant rats treated with 
the same dose level, but the AUC values were higher in monkeys and rats than in mice, in the following order: 
monkeys>rats>mice. This was likely related to the longer mean T1/2 (35.9, 15.3 and 7.6 hrs) and lower mean 
clearance (3.5, 6.13 and 13.5 mL/kg/hr) in monkeys, rats and mice, respectively. In humans, mean T1/2 at 
Assessment report

Page 25/170
therapeutic doses ranged from 82.62 to 101.00 hours and CL ranged from 1.05 to 3.41 ml/hr/kg, being more 
similar to values observed in monkeys. In rabbits, systemic levels after the first dose were higher compared to 
the other species receiving similar doses, in terms of Cmax and AUC, which was associated to lower clearance. 
In mice, the increments of AUC0-t and Cmax were higher than dose-proportional between 2 and 10 mg/kg and 
lower than dose-proportional between 10 and 40 mg/kg. On the contrary, the increment in AUC0-t in rabbits 
was lower than dose-proportional between 2 and 10 mg/kg and higher than dose-proportional between 10 and 
20 mg/kg.
One difference noted between the species was related to the impact of repeated dosing. Whereas no change 
was noted for mice and rats, a decrease in AUC occurred for monkeys on Day 169 as compared to Day 1 and 
for rabbits on GD18. After 6 months treatment, systemic levels decreased mainly in female monkeys at 2 and 
10  mg/kg,  whereas  ADAs  were  observed  in  3  males  at  2  mg/kg,  supporting  ADA  development  was  not 
associated to pharmacokinetic findings. This appears to be due to a faster rate of clearance and distribution, 
due to higher CL, Vz and Vss values reported in groups exhibiting higher decrements in systemic levels after 
repeated  dose,  mainly  females  at  2  and  10  mg/kg.  In  case  of  rabbits,  follow-up  investigation  revealed  the 
presence of anti-pegunigalsidase alfa IgG antibodies in all animals on GD 18. The development of ADAs can be 
correlated to reduced plasma levels of pegunigalsidase alfa in pregnant rabbits, but ADA titers cannot be directly 
correlated to the degree of reduced pegunigalsidase alfa systemic levels.
No consistent gender effects were noted in PK for either species.
Analysis of the PEG moiety was not performed in human or animal’s blood. Pharmacokinetic data of PEG moiety 
in animals after treatment with pegunigalsidase alfa were not considered necessary since the safety of PEG 
moiety after treatment with pegunigalsidase alfa was supported by published data from clinical experience with 
PEG as excipient and non-clinical and clinical data with other pegylated proteins.
Biodistribution studies confirm that pegunigalsidase alfa reached the critical tissues impacted by the disease 
(skin, heart and kidney) as well as liver and spleen and exposure is maintained at least for 7 days in spleen 
and skin and for 14 days in heart, kidney and liver. Although distribution of pegunigalsidase alfa to brain was 
not investigated, pharmacology studies (enzymatic activity and Gb3 levels) support that pegunigalsidase alfa 
does not reach this organ. 
Metabolism  and  excretion  were  not  studied  for  pegunigalsidase  alfa.  Pegunigalsidase  alfa  is  expected  to  be 
enzymatically degraded into amino acids and the PEG moiety clipped off the protein. The metabolism of PEGs 
is described in literature (Webster et al, 2007 and Baumann A. et al, 2014). For PEG1000 and 6000, a maximum 
of  15%  and  4%  of  the  doses  is  cleared  by  metabolism,  respectively,  indicating  that  for  the  free  PEG  of 
pegunigalsidase  alfa,  having  about  2000  Da,  clearance  by  metabolism  is  a  minor  pathway.  In  any  case, 
published data indicate that humans and animals will be exposed to similar metabolites after administration of 
PEG. With regard the excretion of PEG moiety, literature describes that urinary clearance is the major excretory 
pathway for PEGs up to 4000 Da.
2.5.4.  Toxicology
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity
No single-dose toxicity studies have been conducted on pegunigalsidase alfa.
Assessment report 
Error! Unknown document property name.
Page 26/170
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity
The toxicity of pegunigalsidase alfa after repeated administration was studied in CD-1 mice and Cynomolgus 
monkeys with dosing up to 26 weeks. 
The  relevance  of  the  non-clinical  species  that  were  used  to  establish  the  safety  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  was 
established  via  a  comparison  of  the  amino  acid  sequence  of  alpha-GAL-A  in  animals  to  humans:  monkeys 
exhibited 98% homology versus approximately 80% homology for mice, rats and rabbits. These data establish 
that the safety findings in monkeys are most representative of predicting safety in humans as compared to the 
other species. In addition, comparison of fibroblast uptake across species revealed comparable uptake for rats, 
rabbits, monkeys, and humans, but the uptake and uptake-dose relationship were lower for mice. The design 
of toxicity studies in this species is adequate to characterize the toxicological profile of pegunigalsidase alfa.
Mortality occurred in twenty-nine mice, two of them in the control group and in two monkeys. In mice, mortality 
was recorded mainly following the 3rd injection and within 10-50 minutes post-dosing or 2-3 days after injection 
and can be considered allergic reactions, except for 2 animals in the high-dose group who died 7 and 10 days 
after  injection.  The  first  animal  exhibited  multiple  foci  of  bacterial  colonies  in  some  organs,  suggesting  a 
systemic septic process, which can be considered as unrelated to the pegunigalsidase alfa administration. The 
second  animal  was  part  of  the  satellite  group  and  histopathological  analysis  was  not  performed.  Therefore, 
available data do not allow concluding whether the death of this animal might be treatment related. The cause 
of death of one monkey was not determined; however, this animal had mild red discoloration of multiple lung 
lobes  that  correlated  microscopically  with  mild  acute  haemorrhage.  The  other  monkey  was  euthanized  for 
human  reasons  due  to  a  fracture  of  the  humerus  and  the  inability  of  achieving  proper  stabilization  of  the 
fracture. 
The main test article-related clinical signs observed in mice were a transient decrease in the spontaneous motor 
activity and dyspnoea. These clinical signs were initially observed in some animals following the third injection 
of pegunigalsidase alfa on dosing days starting at about 5 to 10 minutes post-dosing and ending at about 10 
to 60 minutes post-dosing. Some animals also exhibited cyanosis and abdominal position, which in 4/13 animals 
occurred  prior  to  their  death.  Decreased  activity  and  red  discoloration  of  the  face  or  forelimbs  were  also 
observed in monkeys. Clinical signs in mice and monkeys and most mortalities in mice were considered allergic 
reactions to a human protein based on that they developed quickly after administration of the drug, resolved 
quickly, their lack of a dose-response and because DPH generally prevented progression to mortality in mice 
and completely resolved the signs in monkeys. This is also supported by a follow-up study in which elevated 
levels of platelet activating factor were observed in animals developing clinical signs. Since it may be a response 
to a foreign protein, these are not likely to represent a safety concern to humans.
There  were  no  significant  test  article-related  effects  on  food  consumption,  ophthalmoscopy,  hematology, 
coagulation,  electrocardiographic  and  urinalysis.  Although  some  statistically  differences  were  reported  in 
treated groups compared to controls, they were of small magnitude, sporadic nature, and/or not dose-related. 
The mean body weights and the mean body weight gains of male monkeys at 40 mg/kg/dose were lower than 
controls at the end of the study, suggesting that this dose might be close to the toxic one.
The increment of AST levels in monkeys at 2 and 40 mg/kg are probably procedure-related such as muscle 
injury during the handling of the monkeys, since the magnitude of AST elevation is greater than the magnitude 
of ALT elevation following muscle damage.
Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration was reported with higher frequency in brains, lungs, pancreas, and salivary 
glands of monkeys treated with 10 or 40 mg/kg of pegunigalsidase alfa and in seminal vesicles and skeletal

muscle at 40 mg/kg. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltration may be an adaptive immune response, which is an 
expected response in animals to a human protein and might be not clinically relevant.
In both species, microscopic changes were noted at the injection site of the control and pegunigalsidase alfa 
groups. These were considered to be related to the injection or infusion procedure and not test article-related 
as  the  effects  occurred  at  a  similar  incidence  and  severity  in  the  placebo  control  and  pegunigalsidase  alfa 
groups. Monkeys exhibited minimal to mild vascular degeneration/necrosis, minimal to moderate haemorrhage, 
minimal to mild acute inflammation, and minimal erosion/ulcer. All changes in the mice were minimal in severity 
and  included  focal  blood  vessel  necrosis,  multifocal  perivascular  haemorrhage,  and  multifocal  perivascular 
inflammation.
Microscopic  adverse  effects  observed  in  the  kidneys  consisted  of  increased  incidence  and/or  mean  severity 
(minimal  to  mild)  of  multifocal  nephropathy  and  minimal  to  mild  interstitial  lymphocytic  infiltration  in 
comparison to control animals. These microscopic adverse effects were not seen in the kidneys of the low and 
mid-dose animals, but these doses do not provide enough safety margin (<0.5) to discard the renal toxicity in 
humans. 
With regard to liver toxicity, hepatocytic vacuolation consistent with fatty change was observed in one male 
mouse treated with 40 mg/kg, the incidence hepatocyte necrosis was higher in treated male and female mice. 
Hepatocyte necrosis was only observed in the interim group in males, while in females, it was observed in the 
interim,  terminal  and  recovery  groups.  Moreover,  minimal  to  mild  Kupffer  cell  hypertrophy  was  found  in 
monkeys. 
The relevance of toxicity studies with pegunigalsidase alfa to assess the safety of free PEG moiety is limited by 
the lack of exposure data to free PEG in humans and animals after administration of the enzyme. Therefore, 
the safety of free PEG is supported by published data from clinical experience with PEG as excipient and non-
clinical and clinical data with other pegylated proteins. PEG molecules are generally regarded as inert and they 
have  no  specific  receptor  or  other  target  proteins  in  tissues.  Literature  also  suggests  that  the  primary 
toxicological effects of PEG are cellular vacuolation and hypersensitivity reactions related to anti-PEG antibody 
formation. Hepatocytic vacuolation was observed in one male mouse treated with pegunigalsidase, which was 
associated to mixed cell infiltration. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity
No genetic toxicity studies have been conducted on pegunigalsidase alfa, which is acceptable due to the 
nature of the product. 
PEG moieties of 0.2−60 kDa have been assessed for the mutagenic and chromosome aberration potential in 
other pegylated proteins, and no evidence of genotoxic potential were observed.
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity
Pegunigalsidase alfa was not evaluated for carcinogenic potential.
The α-GAL-A enzyme is naturally occurring in the body, so the presence of alpha galactosidase per se is not 
associated with any carcinogenic risk. Since pegunigalsidase alfa will be administered to patients with deficiency 
of α-GAL-A, the risk of carcinogenicity due to exposure to pegunigalsidase alfa levels that exceed enzyme levels 
biologically  present  in  the  body  is  low  and  the  risk  arising  from  of  the  manufacturing  process  (impurity, 
reagents, solvents…) is controlled by DS and DP specifications.
Assessment report

Page 28/170
Published carcinogenicity studies with PEG did not reveal carcinogenic potential, although they did not follow 
the ICH requirement (GLP compliance, duration, number of dose tested…). Moreover, PEGylated proteins have 
been used in patients for many years and have not shown any indication of a carcinogenic potential. Therefore, 
there is limited concern regarding the carcinogenic potential of free PEG after pegunigalsidase alfa treatment.
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
In  Sprague  Dawley  rats,  treatment  with  pegunigalsidase  alfa  before  and  during  mating  and  through 
implantation did not have any adverse effects on reproduction and fertility parameters up to the highest dose 
tested, 40 mg/kg. Fertility studies showed that IV administration of pegunigalsidase alfa did not affect mating 
or fertility.
The  potential  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  to  induce  developmental  toxicity  after  maternal  exposure  during 
organogenesis was evaluated in rats and rabbits following intravenous administration. In rats, dosing up to 40 
mg/kg/dose produced no clinical signs, mortality or adverse effects on litter parameters (including total number 
of fetuses, number of live fetuses, mean litter size, mean fetal weights of males and female fetuses and sex 
ratio). In comparison, the embryofetal development study in rabbits resulted in maternal toxicity (mortality, 
abortions,  and  decreased  weight  gain)  at  10  and  20  mg/kg/dose,  which  resulted  in  secondary  decreases  in 
fetal  body  weights.  In  both  species,  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  percent  incidence  of  skeletal 
alterations was observed in the test article groups as compared to the vehicle control group. Most alterations 
were considered no biological significant because their incidences were within historical control data or the lack 
of dose-response.
No prenatal and postnatal developmental studies have been conducted on pegunigalsidase alfa. PK assessment 
in fetus and suckling pups indicated that they are exposed to pegunigalsidase alfa through placenta and milk. 
Low systemic exposure in fetus (between 0.005 and 0.025% of dams’ systemic exposure) and suckling pups 
(maximum 0.014% compared to mother’s systemic exposure) were reported following repeated treatment with 
pegunigalsidase alfa.
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data
Toxicokinetic  data  have  been  collected  from  pharmacokinetics,  repeated  dose  toxicity  and  reproductive  and 
development toxicity studies and are discussed in 2.5.3. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance 
Local tolerance was assessed as part of repeat dose toxicity studies and are discussed in 2.5.4.2.
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies
The  presence  of  antibody  anti-pegunigalsidase  alfa  in  mice  and  monkeys  did  not  impact  the  toxicokinetic 
findings.  On  the  contrary,  anti-pegunigalsidase  alfa  IgG  antibodies  in  rabbits  can  be  correlated  to  reduced 
plasma levels of pegunigalsidase alfa. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
Pegunigalsidase alfa is an enzyme consisting of naturally occurring amino acids linked to a PEG moiety. By 
their nature, it is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment.
Assessment report 
Error! Unknown document property name.
Page 29/170
According  to  the  referred  database  (ECHA)  the  PEG  moiety  does  not  result  in  a  significant  risk  to  the 
environment because its rapid biodegradation in the environment. PEGs do not fulfil the PBT criterion either. 
The  patient  population  for  the  proposed  enzyme  replacement  therapy  is  very  limited  indeed,  thus  it  is 
acceptable that the amount of PEG released into the environment is low compared to amount of PEG released 
into the environment upon other pegylated compounds (cosmetics and already approved drug products).
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of pegunigalsidase alfa have been sufficiently characterised 
through non clinical studies using both in vitro and in vivo settings.
Comparative data versus unmodified plant cell expressed α-GAL-A (BCL) and Replagal (agalsidase alfa) using 
animal  disease  model  (Fabry  mice)  showed  higher  activity  levels  and  longer  activity  duration  in  the  heart, 
kidney and spleen with pegunigalsidase alfa treatment. However, the increment of distribution to organs was 
not  associated  with  a  significantly  increased  efficacy.  Furthermore,  statistically  significant  improvements  in 
functional activity (nociceptive response to heat) and decreases in inflammation in the dorsal root ganglia were 
observed as compared to untreated mice, whereas minimal effects were noted with Replagal (agalsidase alfa) 
or  Fabrazyme  (agalsidase  beta).  The  CHMP  noted  that  inflammation  can  be  associated  with  thermal 
insensitivity, amongst other responses. 
The  causes  of  the  different  PK  profile  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  in  pregnant  rabbits  are  unknown,  but  due  to 
clinical experience with pegunigalsidase and since PK data in humans are available, further non-clinical follow 
up is not warranted. Although the mean Cmax and AUC0-t values increased with increasing dose in all non-
clinical species, the pharmacokinetic was not linear in mice and rabbits.  Plasma levels in fetuses and pups are 
significantly  lower  than  in  mothers  but  the  available  pharmacology  studies  do  not  allow  to  determine  the 
minimum pharmacological active dose and due to drug-sensitivity, it may be different at various development 
stages. Other potential non-pharmacological adverse effects on developmental organs (e.g. cell vacuolation) 
during late pregnancy and lactation cannot be excluded. Section 5.3 of the SmPC describes the lack of prenatal 
and postnatal developmental studies and its potential clinical consequences: risks for fetus and pups during 
the late pregnancy and lactation are unknown. 
The main target organs of pegunigalsidase alfa toxicity were kidneys (in mice) and liver (in mice and monkeys). 
The reported increased incidence and/or mean severity of multifocal nephropathy and interstitial lymphocytic 
infiltration  in  the  kidneys  are  described  in  section  5.3  of  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  glomerulonephritis 
membranoproliferative, chronic kidney disease and proteinuria have been observed in patients after treatment 
with pegunigalsidase alfa and have been included as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in section 4.8 of SmPC and 
thus, no further non-clinical follow up is required. 
Similar to kidney findings, the risk of hepatotoxicity for humans cannot be excluded based on exposure data, 
but regarding liver, no adverse effects have been reported in humans. Cellular vacuolation is a known risk of 
PEGylated proteins and Kupffer cell hypertrophy may be an immune response to a foreign protein. Altogether, 
these data support that liver may be a target organ of pegunigalsidase alfa and microscopic findings in livers 
of mice and monkeys are described in section 5.3 of the SmPC.
Despite the low incidence of the hepatocytic vacuolation (1/19), this finding is described in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC because it is a known risk of PEGylated proteins, there is no safety margin for humans and the long-
term consequences of PEG accumulation and deposition in the body is still not fully characterised. With regard

anti-PEG antibody response, immunogenicity analyses in non-clinical animal studies are not relevant in terms 
of predicting potential immunogenicity in humans, thus this potential risk are further discussed in section 2.6.
The lack of genotoxicity studies with pegunigalsidase alfa is acceptable due to the nature of the product. Since 
pegunigalsidase alfa is an enzyme replacement treatment, the risk of carcinogenicity is low.
Pegunigalsidase alfa is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Overall, the non-clinical aspects of pegunigalsidase alfa have been adequately documented and meet the 
requirements to support this application.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology
The clinical pharmacological program for pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) encompasses eight completed and 
ongoing clinical Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 studies. See Table 3.
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
Pegunigalsidase alfa in plasma was detected via ELISA assays. Regarding immunogenicity, different methods 
were used. 
PK data were analysed using non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population PK modelling. Population PK 
modelling and PK/PD analyses were performed using pooled data from studies PB-102-F01, PB-102-F02, PB-
102-F20,  and  PB-102-F50  (Reports  ICX-B152,  ICX-B160,  ICX-B173  MSAR1,  and  ICX-B173  MSAR2).  For 
population PK modelling, the nonlinear-mixed effects modelling approach with NONMEM software was used. No 
particular statistical analysis outside of population PK was performed. Due to the inadequacy of the original 
population PK and PK/PD (or [dose]-exposure-response) model, an updated model using available data from 
adults was requested by the CHMP in order to support an adequate characterisation, description and prediction 
the PK (and PD) of pegunigalsidase alfa in this population. However the most relevant model as presented by 
the  applicant  (ICX-B173  MSAR2)  during  the  procedure  still  had  misspecifications  in  structure  and  was  not 
considered reliable and predictable. For this reason, only graphical representation is provided below regarding 
potential  ADA  effect  on  PK/PD  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  and  relationship  between  plasma  concentration  and 
response, in addition to data based on NCA.
Absorption 
Following IV infusion, pegunigalsidase alfa was immediately bioavailable.
Distribution
Pegunigalsidase alfa is not expected to bind to plasma proteins.
Elimination
The excretion of PRX-102 has not been evaluated. This is acceptable due to the nature of the product. 
Furthermore, the molecular weight of pegunigalsidase alfa is ~116 KDa, which is twice the cut-off value for 
glomerular filtration, thus excluding filtration and/or proteolytic degradation in kidneys. Based on NCA, t1/2 
ranges from 53 to 134 h (minimum 53.4 h in study PB-102-F01 and Study PB-102-F02, and maximum 133.7 
h in PB-102-F50). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies
For patients who received 1 and 2 mg/kg Elfabrio, there were increases in mean t1/2 and AUC0-∞ with 
increasing duration of treatment and corresponding decreases in Cl and Vz, suggesting a saturated clearance. 
In the same studies, a definite time and dose effect as Cl and Vz decrease with the numbers of doses 
received could be seen, and that effect was even more marked with highest doses. 
Special populations
The effect of special populations (i.e. gender, race, ethnicity, and age) or other covariates (weight) on the PK 
behaviour of pegunigalsidase alfa is not fully clear. In particular, whereas study PB-102-F20 may show a

gender effect, with a small number of subjects and possibly an ADA-effect covariate, study PB-102-F50 did 
not show any covariate effect on PK/PD of pegunigalsidase alfa in the adult population. 
No studies have been carried out in subjects with renal or hepatic impaired function. 
The final population PK model, as presented by the applicant (report ICX-B173 MSAR2), is a 3-compartment 
model with zero-order absorption, first-order elimination and interindividual variability on CL, V1, Q3, and V3. 
A combined error model was used stratified by Study PB-102-F01/ PB-102-F02 versus the other two studies. 
Inter-occasion variability on bioavailability was implemented. Covariates were identified for IgG titer on CL 
and V1 (Emax models), and study PB-102-F01/PB-102-F02 on CL, V1, Q3, and V3.
ADA positive patients seem to have remarkably lower exposure compared to ADA negative patients (Figure 3, 
Figure 4, and Figure 5). Thus ADA formation might affect the therapeutic effect.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
No interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human protein, pegunigalsidase alfa 
is an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions.
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials
See above.
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
The active substance of Elfabrio is pegunigalsidase alfa. Pegunigalsidase alfa is a pegylated recombinant form 
of human α-galactosidase-A. The amino acid sequence of the recombinant form is similar to the naturally 
occurring human enzyme.
Pegunigalsidase alfa supplements or replaces α-galactosidase-A, the enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of 
the terminal α-galactosyl moieties of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides in the lysosome, reducing the 
amount of accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3).
Primary and Secondary pharmacology
Renal Gb3 inclusion bodies and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) concentrations are the main PD 
markers that were followed as part of PB-102-F01/02 and PB-102-F03.
In study PB-102-F01, kidney biopsies of peritubular capillaries (PTCs) were analysed for Gb3 inclusions using 
the quantitative Barisoni Lipid Inclusion Scoring System (BLISS) methodology. Overall, 11 out of 14 (78.6%) 
patients with available biopsies had substantial reduction (≥50%) in their BLISS score following 6 months of 
treatment with pegunigalsidase alfa and a reduction of ≥20% was achieved by 12 out of 14 (85.7%). At any 
dose, Gb3 inclusions were reduced from a mean (SE) score of 4.3 (0.9) at baseline to 0.8 (0.2) after 6 
months of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment (mean [SE] reduction in score of 67.8% [8.9%], n=13).
Data on plasma Lyso-Gb3 in treatment-naïve patients, males and females, respectively were considered the 
most informative Fabry disease-specific biomarker and are presented in Error! Reference source not 
found. and Error! Reference source not found.. Plasma Lyso-Gb3 was evaluated before dosing initiation, 
every 3 months for the first 36 months (including the 12 months from PB-102-F01/F02), and every 6 months 
after 36 months of treatment. 
For treatment-naïve patients with Fabry disease (n=16), mean (±standard error [SE]) plasma Lyso-Gb3 
concentration at baseline was higher in males (Treatment Group I: 134.2±47.2 ng/mL; II: 100.6±39.4 
ng/mL; and III: 61.8 ng/mL) than in females (13.4±5.9 ng/mL; 10.6±3.8 ng/mL; and 6.4±2.3 ng/mL) in all 
cohorts, consistent with the expectation of the disease state.
Analysis of the overall population, including patients who completed 12 months of treatment with 
pegunigalsidase alfa (n=16), indicates that Lyso-Gb3 concentration decreased significantly in response to the 
treatment (p=0.010), from a mean of 66.7±19.5 to 22.6±5.1 ng/mL. All 16 patients showed a reduction in 
plasma Lyso-Gb3 concentration from Baseline, ranging from -0.4 to -203.4 ng/mL.

In all 3 treatment groups, a greater mean reduction from Baseline was observed in males (Treatment Group 
I: -61.8% mean reduction, n=4; II: -67.7% mean reduction, n=4; and III: -50.2% mean reduction, n=1) 
than in females (Treatment Group I: -6.6% mean reduction, n=2; II: -44.5% mean reduction, n=2; and III: 
-37.2% mean reduction, n=3.
A reduction in plasma Lyso-Gb3 concentration was observed across all doses; however, the most pronounced 
reduction (mean -51.6 ng/mL; -59.9%) was observed at 1.0 mg/kg (n=6). A responder analysis indicated 
that the majority (56.3%) of patients had a greater than 50% reduction and 12.5% had a greater than 75% 
reduction in plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels after 12 months of treatment.

concentrations over time for studies PB-102-F01, PB-102-F02, PB-102-F50 and PB-102-F20 are presented in 
Figure 8 and Figure 9. Female patients had little or no elevated levels of Lyso-Gb3 at baseline and no 
reduction in Lyso-Gb3 with increase in exposure of pegunigalsidase alfa (Figure 8). Concentration – effect-
relationships can be observed only in treatment naïve male patients. For male patients switching from prior 
treatments (Studies PB-102-F20 and PB-102-F50) to pegunigalsidase alfa, data suggest the Lyso-Gb3 levels 
remain stable and are not correlated with exposures pegunigalsidase alfa. Relative changes in Lyso-Gb3 in 
Studies PB-102-F20 and PB-102-F50 were not considered to be clinically meaningful.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
The pharmacokinetic profile of pegunigalsidase alfa has been sufficiently characterised. Nevertheless, in studies 
PB-102-F01  and  PB-102-F02,  dose  proportionality  was  not  demonstrated,  and  this  can  be  reassessed  with 
further data once available.
The impact of the quality differences on the resulting DS batches used during pre-clinical studies, clinical studies 
and for commercial manufacture can be neglected (see quality). Thus, the use of different pegylation reagents 
is  deemed  not  significant  on  the  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  pegunigalsidase  and  the 
bioanalytical data (both pegunigalsidase and ADA measurements).
At initial submission, the proposed recommended dose of PRX-102 is 1 mg/kg administered once every two 
weeks (Q2W or EOW) by intravenous (IV) infusion or 2 mg/kg administered once every four weeks (Q4W or 
E4W) by IV infusion. The choice between the two posology options was to be selected based on the clinical 
judgement, patient compliance and response to treatment. 
Although analysis of PK data from the 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa Q4W were provided during the procedure 
and were considered comparable to Q2W, such an alternative regimen was not considered acceptable by the 
CHMP based on the presented evidence on efficacy (see section 2.6.6). In addition, due to several deficiencies, 
the final population PK model, as presented by the applicant, could not be used to guide dosing strategies.
Thus, the CHMP recommended a posology of 1 mg/kg Q2W as investigated in the main study and in line with 
the dose finding data (see section 2.6.6). The CHMP noted that although elimination half-life of pegunigalsidase 
alfa seems much longer compared to other approved ERTs in the same indication, the dosing frequency remains 
the same (Q2W) and as such, a claim for improvement of the PK properties due to the pegylation cannot be 
made. Furthermore, the relationship between the elimination half-life and doses remains unclear in the absence 
of comparative data from other approved ERTs of the same indication.
The PK profile of pegunigalsidase alfa is not expected to be impacted by hepatic or renal impairment. No dose 
adjustment is not recommended in these populations.
Since the final PK/PD modelling, as presented by the applicant, is considered inadequate by the CHMP, 
relevant SmPC information is based on data from NCA only.
Data from the main PD markers, renal Gb3 inclusion bodies and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3 
concentrations) are supportive of the efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa since such changes are not anticipated 
without effective ERT. Specifically:
 Gb3 inclusions were reduced from a mean (SE) score of 4.3 (0.9) at baseline to 0.8 (0.2) after 6 months 
of pegunigalsidase alfa treatment (mean [SE] reduction in score of 67.8% [8.9%].

A reduction in plasma Lyso-Gb3 concentration was observed across all doses; the most pronounced 
reduction (mean -51.6 ng/mL; -59.9%) was observed at 1.0 mg/kg (n=6). A responder analysis 
indicated that the majority (56.3%) of patients had a greater than 50% reduction and 12.5% had a 
greater than 75% reduction in plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels after 12 months of treatment. A clear trend 
between pegunigalsidase alfa exposure and change in plasma Lyso-Gb3 could not be observed.
Based on graphical investigations (see Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5), ADA positive patients appeared to 
have lower therapeutic effect. More pronounced differences in PK concentrations and parameters correlated 
with patient ADA titers and thus it is clear that the immune response against PRX-102 is an important 
predictor of the plasma levels. However, the shape of this relationship is not clear since many patients who

were switched from the standard therapy to PRX-102, already had neutralizing antibodies to PRX-102 at 
Day 1. The PRX-102 levels in these patients were much lower, sometimes zero. PRX-102 is dosed by body 
weight but the dependence of PRX-102 levels on body weight is not clear, in the absence of an adequate 
PK/PD modelling. These uncertainties can be reassessed with further data once available.
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
Overall, the pharmacological profile of pegunigalsidase alfa in human studies has been adequately documented 
and meet the requirements to support this application.
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy
2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies)
PB-102-F01  was  an  open-label,  dose  ranging  study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity and exploratory efficacy parameters of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) in adult (>18 years of 
age) Fabry patients. Patients were enrolled into one of three pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) treatment groups 
(0.2, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg; up to 6-8 patients per group) and received intravenous infusions every 2 weeks for 12 
weeks (total of 7 infusions). Patients who enrolled into the extension study PB-102-F02 were to continue to 
receive the same dose of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) they received in study PB-102-F01 every 2 weeks for 
38 weeks (9 months).
Patients who completed 12 months treatment of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) were eligible to enter PB-
102-F03 for an additional 24-month treatment period which was further amended to a 60-month study 
duration. The aim of BP 102-F03 was to evaluate the ongoing safety, tolerability and efficacy parameters.
Inclusion in PB-102-F01 was open to symptomatic adult Fabry patients (≥18 years, males and females) who 
had never received ERT or had not received ERT in the past 6 months and had a negative anti-pegunigalsidase 
alfa  (PRX-102)  antibody  test  (ERT-naïve).  Males  were  required  to  have  plasma  and/or  leukocyte  α-GAL-A 
activity  less  than  lower  limit  of  normal  in  plasma  and/or  leukocytes,  while  females  were  required  to  have 
historical  genetic  test  results  consistent  with  Fabry  mutations.  All  patients  had  to  have  an  eGFR  ≥ 60 
mL/min/1.73  m²  and globotriaosylceramide  (Gb3) concentration in urine  > 1.5 times upper  limit of  normal 
(ULN).  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  severe  kidney  or  cardiac  disease  or  if  ACEi  or  ARB  therapy  was 
initiated, or the dose changed in the 4 weeks before screening. 
Three doses of pegunigalsidase alfa (0.2, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg) were administered sequentially with an intention of 
a minimum of 2 females and 4 males to be enrolled per dose group before the subsequent dose group was 
enrolled. The selection of the two lower doses of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) in this study was to provide 
dosing equivalent to the referenced regimens of Fabrazyme (0.2 mg/kg) and Replagal (1.0 mg/kg).
Study PB-102-F01/ PB-102-F02
Up to 24 adult patients were planned to be enrolled into study PB-102-F01. Nineteen (19) patients were eligible 
for enrollment. Six (6) patients were enrolled in the 0.2 mg/kg treatment group, 9 in the 1.0 mg/kg and 4 in 
the 2.0 mg/kg treatment groups. Two (2) patients in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group discontinued from the 
study, one experienced a hypersensitivity reaction and one was non-compliant.
Sixteen (16) patients completed study PB-102-F01 (3 months) and all 16 patients enrolled into the extension 
study PB-102-F02. All sixteen (16) patients completed study PB-102-F02. Fifteen (15) patients (one patient in

Cardiac parameters
At Month 12, male patients had a minor mean decrease from baseline in Left Ventricular Mass (LVM) in both 
0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg treatment groups. One patient who received 2.0 mg/kg had a slight increase in LVM 
from  baseline.  Male  patients  had  also  a  minor  mean  decrease  from  baseline  in  Left  Ventricular  Mass  Index 
(LVMI) in both the 0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg treatment groups. One patient who received 2.0 mg/kg had also 
a slight increase in LVMI from baseline. Female patients had a marginal mean increase from baseline in LVMI 
in all three treatment groups.  In addition, male patients had a minor mean decrease from baseline in Ejection 
Fraction (EF) in all three groups: 0.2 mg/kg (-2.6%, -4.7% mean percent decrease, n=4), 1.0 mg/kg (-10.1%, 
-15.2% mean percent decrease, n=4), and 2.0 mg/kg (-0.4%, -0.7% percent decrease, n=1). Female patients 
had a slight mean increase from baseline in EF in both the 0.2 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg groups; in contrast, the 
2.0 mg/kg treatment group had a mean decrease from baseline.
Most  of  the  assessed  parameters  using  echocardiography  (at  screening  and  at  Months  6  and  12)  exhibited 
stable cardiac function after 12 months of treatment.
Brain MRI
The qualitative assessments of stroke at baseline and Month 12 showed there was no evidence of stroke 
detected in patient MRIs of the brain.
Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI)
An overall slight reduction from baseline was demonstrated at Month 12 in the total general score (0.2 
mg/kg, -2.8; 1.0 mg/kg, -1.2; 2.0 mg/kg, -1.5) of MSSI. 
Gastrointestinal Symptoms Assessment (GSA) Questionnaire
Most patient responses to the GSA questionnaire showed a stable or favourable trend in the severity of 
abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, and frequency of diarrhoea after 12 months of treatment. 
Short Form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)
At Month 12, patient responses to the BPI questionnaire showed a slight decrease from baseline severity 
score in pain and the pain interference score. 
Study PB-102-F03
Up to 16 adult Fabry patients (males and females) (≥18 years) who completed study PB-102-F02 were planned 
to be included. A total of 15 adult patients (8 males and 7 females) were enrolled. Ten patients completed the 
study. Five patients discontinued from the study: three due to consent withdrawal, one due to a fatal, unrelated 
AE and one due to other reasons (pregnancy).

The mean (SE) annualized eGFR slope was -1.6 mL/min/1.73 m²/year (0.8). The mean annualized eGFR 
slopes were more negative (indicating a higher decrease in eGFR over time) in male versus female patients 
and in long-term treated patients compared to the overall population.
Cardiac parameters
The mean (SE) LVM absolute value was considered to be within normal ranges. the mean (SE) absolute LVM 
values remained normal at Month 24 and Month 60. The mean (SE) LVMI absolute value was considered to 
be within normal ranges for male patients and below normal for female patients. A slow increase in mean 
LVMI was observed in the course of the study in both subgroups, with larger increases in female patients. At 
Month 60, the male patients remained within normal levels throughout, and the increase in LVMI in female 
patients led to a mean value at Month 60 also within normal ranges. The mean (SE) EF absolute value was 
considered to be within normal ranges and remained stable over 60 months of treatment.
No relevant changes from screening were observed during the study in the echocardiography parameters. 
Most patients had normal parameters throughout the study.

Mean (SE) change from baseline in the overall score was -7.5 (1.8) at month 24 and -3.6 (2.3) at month 60. 
All mean sub-scores showed decreases.
Fabry Clinical Events
A single Fabry Clinical Event was identified; a non-cardiac-related death following a COPD exacerbation in a 
patient after 39 months of treatment. The event was considered unrelated to study treatment.
Gastrointestinal Symptoms Assessment Questionnaire
Post-baseline evaluations generally showed a reduction of the number of patients with moderate or severe 
abdominal pain except at month 48 where high levels of moderate pain were reported. Reporting rates for 
frequencies of abdominal pain and diarrhoea fluctuated in the course of the study. No clear trends were 
observed for the proportions of patients with symptoms over time.
2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies)
STUDY PB-102-F20
PB-102-F20, the main Phase 3 study, is a randomised, double-blind, active control designed to investigate 
the safety and efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa compared to Fabrazyme (algasidase beta) and assess renal 
function in adult patients with Fabry disease previously treated with Fabrazyme (algasidase beta).

3. Females: 
a. historical genetic test results consistent with Fabry pathogenic mutation and one or more of the described 
characteristic features of Fabry disease: neuropathic pain, cornea verticillata, clustered angiokeratoma


Treatments
Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta. Both 
products were administered at the same dosage and on the same schedule: 1 mg of drug per kg of body 
weight, once every two weeks by intravenous infusion. There was no treatment adjustment in the group of 
patients previously treated with agalsidase beta.
 Objectives
At  initial  submission,  an  interim  report  collecting  up  to  the  date  of  the  last  patient’s  12-month  visit  was 
presented. During the procedure, the final report with data up to 24 months for all participants was submitted.
The aim of the interim analysis was to demonstrate that in terms of eGFR slope, pegunigalsidase alfa is non-
inferior to agalsidase beta by a non-inferiority margin of 3.0 ml/min/1.73 m²/year. Secondary objectives were 
to  determine  effect  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  over  agalsidase  beta  on  use  of  pain  medication,  estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); UPCR; plasma Gb3, plasma lyso-Gb3, urine lyso-Gb3; Short Form Brief Pain 
Inventory; Quality of Life; Mainz Severity Score Index; cardiac stress test; echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI.
The aim of the final 2 years analysis was initially planned to demonstrate superiority of pegunigalsidase alfa 
over agalsidase beta to support the submission of another regulatory authority. In January 2022, the applicant 
modified the objective for the final analysis from superiority to non-inferiority testing.
 Outcomes/endpoints
The primary endpoint was change from baseline in measure of eGFR slope.
Secondary endpoints are the change from baseline in other efficacy measures; determination of PK 
parameters (subset of patients only), biomarkers of Fabry disease, and evaluation of safety measures.

 Sample size
Interim Analysis – Non inferiority testing
With a total of approximately 66 patients in a 2:1 randomization ratio, there was at least 90% power to 
demonstrate the non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa vs. agalsidase beta in terms of mean annualized 
change (slope) in eGFR. The power was computed assuming a one-sided two-sample t-test with a one-sided 
alpha level of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year. The true difference in slopes 
was assumed to be 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m2/year in favour of pegunigalsidase alfa, with the standard deviation 
of the slopes being 1.5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year in each group.
Final Analysis – Superiority testing (as initially planned)
With a total of approximately 66 patients in a 2:1 randomization ratio, there will be approximately 80% 
power to detect a difference of 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year between the mean annualized changes (slope) in 
the two arms. The power was computed assuming a two-sample t-test at a two sided alpha level of 0.05 and 
a standard deviation of the slopes of 1.5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year in each group. For this analysis, the null 
hypothesis is that the difference in mean annualized change in eGFR between the treatment groups is 0, 
Assessment report

Page 57/170
versus an alternative hypothesis that it is not 0. Based on previous research, the mean annualized change 
(slope) in eGFR in patients treated with agalsidase beta is -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year. A 1.1 reduction in the 
rate of decline in renal function (improvement) is anticipated to be equal to a mean annualized change 
(slope) in eGFR with pegunigalsidase alfa of -1.9 mL/min/1.73 m²/year representing an approximately 30% 
improvement, which would be considered clinically relevant.
To allow for a dropout rate as high as 15%, it was planned for approximately 78 patients to be randomized: 
approximately 52 patients to the PRX-102 arm and approximately 26 to the agalsidase beta arm. This was 
expected to yield approximately 44 and 22 completers in the two arms, respectively.
These power calculations were based on a two-sample t-test, and were performed using the PASS-13 Tests 
for Two Means procedure.
 Randomisation and Blinding (masking)
A fixed block randomization list, stratified at baseline by urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR, was 
generated with a 2:1 randomization (PRX-102:agalsidase beta) and incorporated into the system. Once 
patient eligibility was confirmed by the sponsor’s Medical Monitor, the system generated a subject 
randomization ID number. The investigative staff and patients were blinded to the treatment assignment.
Since PRX-102 and agalsidase beta differ in appearance and packaging, the individual doses for infusion were 
prepared by an unblinded pharmacist or nurse at the site, resulting in identical infusion bag appearance and 
blinded labelling prior to administration. 
Both the patients and the staff members administering the treatments were blinded as to what the infusion 
bag contained.
 Statistical methods
Analysis populations
The following populations were used for tables summarizing efficacy and safety:
• The Intent to Treat (ITT) population consisted of all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
(including a partial dose) of study medication (either pegunigalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta), and was based 
on the assigned treatment arm in the randomization. 
• The Per Protocol (PP) population included all ITT patients who completed at least 12 months of treatment, 
with study drug compliance of at least 80%, and with no major protocol violations that could have impacted 
the primary endpoint. The PP is considered as a supportive analysis for the primary efficacy analysis; 
however, for the non-inferiority analysis of this interim report, the ITT and PP populations have a similar 
weight in the interpretation of the results.
• The Safety population consisted of all patients who were randomized and who received at least one partial 
dose of study medication. Assignment was by actual treatment received.
Primary endpoint analyses
Four different statistical approaches were considered, in order to compare the annualized slope between the 
treatment arms. Within the framework of a longitudinal mixed model, two models were considered, a random 
intercept model (RI) and a random intercept random slope (RIRS) model.
Assessment report 
Error! Unknown document property name.
Page 58/170
Within the framework of a two-stage approach, the first stage includes estimation of individual slopes using 
linear  regression.  Two  models  were  considered  for  the  2nd  stage:  Analysis  of  Covariance  (ANCOVA)  and 
quantile regression for comparing the median slopes.
For the interim analysis the models considered were the RIRS, RI and two-stage with ANCOVA.
The two-stage with quantile regression was added following a recent publication by Ortiz et al (2021) in which 
the median eGFR slope of Fabrazyme was compared to the median eGFR slope of un-treated Fabry patients. 
Unlike linear regression which makes distributional assumptions (i.e., normality), the quantile regression makes 
no such assumptions, and is robust against outliers
Following interaction with another regulatory authority, the two-stage with quantile regression on the ITT set 
was considered as the primary model for the final analysis. For non-inferiority, both the ITT and PP should be 
considered when interpreting the study, so the analysis will be performed also on the PP set.The two-stage 
with  ANCOVA,  RI,  RIRS  on  the  ITT  and  PP  were  considered  as  supportive.  For  all  of  the  analyses  time  was 
measured relative to day of 1st infusion.
The primary analysis at the interim time point (when the last patient completes 1 year of treatment) is a non-
inferiority analysis. The null hypothesis is that the difference in slopes between the two treatment arms is ≤ -
3.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year versus the alternative that it is larger. Non-inferiority will be declared if the lower 
bound of the 95% CI for the interaction term of treatment group by time is greater than -3.0 mL/min/1.73 
m²/year, the pre-specified non-inferiority margin. If this criterion is met, then it implies that the slope of the 
eGFR in the PRX-102 treatment arm is not worse than -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m²/year compared to the slope in the 
agalsidase beta group. All available data will be used for the interim and final analyses, in particular, for the 
evaluation  of  non-inferiority  which  occurs  after  the  last  patient  completes  1  year  of  treatment,  all  available 
data up to the cut-off date, from each patient will be used (i.e., data that extends beyond one year).
The  primary  analysis  at  the  final  time  point  (after  the  last  enrolled  patient  has  2-years  of  treatment)  was 
initially a superiority analysis. The null hypothesis is that the difference in slopes between the two treatment 
arms is 0 versus the two-sided alternative. Superiority will be declared if the coefficient associated with the 
time  by  treatment  interaction  is  positive  and  significantly  different  than  0  at  a  two-sided  level  of  0.05,  or 
equivalently  if  the  lower  bound  of  the  confidence  interval  for  the  interaction  term  is  greater  than  0.  In  the 
submission (during the procedure) of the final study report, the objective of the final analysis was changed into 
a non-inferiority testing. As no previously established clinically relevant NI margin is available, the NI margin 
in this study was identified using the combined knowledge on the natural history of the disease and the data 
published on the effect of available treatments on renal function deterioration in Fabry Disease patients. As 
claimed  by  the  applicant,  the  collective  reported  evidence  supports  the  clinical  choice  of  the  -3 
ml/min/1.73m2/year as the lower boundary of the CI also for this 2 years NI analysis for the following reasons:
- Evidence on the natural history of the disease suggests that untreated patients tend to present progressive 
kidney  deterioration  by  showing  an  eGFR  slope  worse  than  -3  ml/min/1.73m2/year  (from  around  -4  to  -12 
ml/min/1.73m2/year), therefore achieving -3 ml/min/1.73m2/year can be considered as a relevant threshold 
for assessing the benefit of a disease specific treatment.
-  The  European  Therapeutic  Goals  published  by  Wanner  (2018)  has  used  the  same  threshold  for  defining 
patients considered clinically stable with regards to renal function (one of the main goals for long-life treatment 
of progressing diseases), thus confirming that -3 ml/min/1.73m2/year is a reasonable threshold from a clinical 
perspective.

Page 59/170
- Finally, this threshold was pre-defined in Version 1.0 of the study protocol and used for the first 12 months 
NI interim analysis, mainly on the basis of what was already known on the natural history of the disease and 
on what is published in literature on the treatments effect. Considering that the slope is an annualized measure 
the use of the same margin is considered an appropriate approach (since the NI hypothesis is tested on the 
same population, with additional data).
Sensitivity/supportive analyses for robustness on primary endpoint
The sensitivity analyses used the same estimand as the primary analysis but differed in the covariates used. 
The supportive analyses used different estimands (mean using RIRS, RI, and two-stage with ANCOVA; mean 
eGFR change from baseline using a Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) and other quantiles using 
quantile regression).
Sensitivity analyses included: a two-stage with quantile regression was repeated including the stratification 
factor (UPCR < 1; ≥ 1 gr/gr), analysis with exclusions of any eGFR value associated with events of an 
elevated serum creatinine, defined by a 1.5-fold increase or greater compared to the immediate previous 
serum creatinine value as long as that measurement was taken no more than 34 days before.
For the interim report, further exploration of the group difference in eGFR slope was done through several 
pre-specified sensitivity analyses: a 2-stage sensitivity analysis, in which the first stage calculated the slopes 
for each patient and the second stage compared the treatment arms with ANCOVA using those slopes; a 
random intercept model, which is similar to the random intercept random slope model used for the main 
analysis; and a Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model. 
Supportive analyses included: A RIRS longitudinal mixed model used to compare the eGFR slopes of the two 
groups, a two-Stage Approach Using Analysis of Covariance (The 1st stage of this approach is identical to the 
1st  stage  of  the  two-stage  with  quantile  regression.  At  the  next  stage,  the  eGFR  slope  between  the  two 
treatment arms was compared using ANCOVA. The dependent variable was the slope of each individual patient 
and  the  model  included  the  same  covariates  as  the  primary  analysis);  Random  Intercept  (RI)  Longitudinal 
Model (similar to the RIRS Longitudinal Model, but the random effect included only the intercept as random 
component); MMRM analysis using the eGFR change from baseline (response variable was the change from 
Baseline in eGFR at each scheduled study visit where eGFR was measured. The model included the following 
covariates: intercept; Baseline eGFR; Visit; Treatment arm and visit by treatment interaction. Non-inferiority 
was declared if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the contrast between treatment arms at the 2-year visit 
(Week 104) is greater than or equal to -6.0 mL/min/1.73 m2/year) and a two-stage with quantile regression 
with  additional  quantiles  (analysis  repeated  for  the  ITT  and  PP,  where  in  the  2nd  stage  the  25th  and  75th 
quantiles as well as their difference was estimated instead of the median). 
The sensitivity and supportive analyses as described were performed for ITT and  PP sets and summarized 
graphically with a Forest plot. Evaluation of non-inferiority was done similar to the primary analysis.
Sensitivity analyses for Missing Data 
The primary analysis and the sensitivity analyses assume that the missing data were Missing At Random (MAR). 
Multiple Imputation (MI) was used to assess the impact of missing data. To this end MI under the
MAR  assumption  was  conducted  for  patients  who  early  terminated.  Missing  data  were  imputed  within  each 
treatment arm.
Multiplicity issues

Page 60/170
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  both  interim  and  final  analyses  is  the  mean  annualized  change  (slope)  in 
estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR).  The  interim  analysis  is  a  non-inferiority  analysis  and  the  final 
analysis was a superiority analysis (as initially planned). As claimed by the applicant, for regulatory purposes, 
demonstration  of  non-inferiority  of  PRX-102  compared  to  agalsidase  beta  at  12  months  to  support  the  EU 
submission  and  superiority  at  24  months  to  support  the  submission  of  another  regulatory  authority  will  be 
considered trial success.
The interim analysis occurs after the last patient randomized has completed 12 months of treatment The non-
inferiority assessment will be evaluated at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. The final analysis will be conducted 
when all patients complete 24 months of treatment. This superiority assessment will be performed using a two-
sided alpha level of 0.05. Since there is no intention to stop the study for futility or efficacy and no plan for 
study adaptations based on outcomes of the interim analysis, no alpha penalty for the final superiority analysis 
is needed.
Subgroup Analysis
Subgroup analyses will be conducted based on baseline characteristics and demographics for selected efficacy 
and safety endpoints and only if the size of each of the groups is at least 10 (combined over the two 
treatment arms). In case of a substantial overlap between different sub-groups (e.g. up to 2 patients who 
differ), one of these subgroups may be skipped.
The selection of subgroup will be from the following list:
- Gender (Male or Female)
- Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) status at baseline (Negative; Positive). Determination of status is based on 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive at baseline (Section 11.7). For patients who were randomized to PRX-102 
arm, their ADA status at for PRX-102 at baseline will be used. For patients who were randomized to 
agalsidase-beta arm, their ADA status at for agalsidase-beta at baseline will be used. In case the test for 
baseline visit is missing, then the result from the screening visit will be used.
- Fabry Disease (FD) classification (Classic/Non-Classic). In order to be classified as FD classic, a patient 
should have ≤ 5% mean of lab normal ranges residual enzymatic activity in plasma or leukocytes at baseline 
visit and at least one Fabry specific symptom: Cornea Verticillata, Acroparesthesias, Angiokeratomas.
- Baseline eGFR (≤ 60; 60 < and ≤ 90; > 90 mL/min/1.73m²)
- Annualized slope of eGFR (≤ -5; > -5 mL/min/1.73m²/year)
- Use of ACEi or ARB treatment at baseline (Yes/No). The usage of ACEi or ARB is based on classification in 
the medication form in the eCRF. Based on this form, it is possible to identify patients who received ACEi or 
ARB at Baseline date. All other patients will be classified as “No” for this subgroup.
- Region (United States (US)/ex-US)
- UPCR categories (≤ 0.5 gr/gr; 0.5 < and < 1 gr/gr; ≥1 gr/gr).
Changes in SAP (January 2022) for final analysis
As presented by the applicant, the following changes were made in SAP, mainly following regulatory authority 
interactions:
- The following endpoints were added: Infusion-related reactions (IRRs), occurrence of Fabry clinical events, 
and achievement of Fabry Kidney Disease Therapeutic Goals.
Assessment report 
Error! Unknown document property name.
Page 61/170
- Analysis sets: The protocol stated that a patient who received at least one complete dose of study product 
would be included in the ITT population; the SAP changed this to also include receipt of at least one partial 
dose. The Per Protocol population was defined in the protocol to include patients who completed the study 
with no major protocol deviations; the SAP added a compliance requirement and refined the type of major 
protocol deviations to be excluded.
- The primary analysis of the study was changed from superiority to non-inferiority, as demonstrating 
superiority was no longer required.
- The primary analysis was changed to the two-stage with quantile regression, and the RIRS (primary 
analysis for the interim analysis) is now a supportive analysis. In addition to estimating the median slope, 
quantile regression was used to estimate the 25th and 75th quantiles as supportive analysis.
- UPCR was removed from all models (RIRS, RI, 2-stage with ANCOVA, MMRM for eGFR change from BL and 
for lyso-Gb3 change from BL). Quantile regression for the median which includes UPCR as a covariate was 
presented as a sensitivity analysis.
- The approach for multiplicity control 
- The only shift table for laboratory values was for changes in ADA status. No other shift tables are provided, 
as no other safety laboratory values are of special interest.
- Evaluation of Acute Kidney Injury is based on AE reporting and clinical judgment of the investigator, not as 
described in the protocol.
- The statistical section of the protocol had stated that hypersensitivity was to be analyzed as an AE of special 
interest. Since IRRs were added as an endpoint (see first item in this list), hypersensitivity were evaluated as 
part of IRRs, being a wider category.
Post-hoc analyses
To further investigate the impact of the imbalances at baseline for the baseline characteristics, the primary 
analysis was repeated with the following parameters added as covariate to the primary analysis model: 
Gender, Fabry disease classification and ADA status at baseline.
Results
 Participant flow
A total of 127 prospective subjects were assessed for inclusion. Of these, 49 failed screening and 78 were 
enrolled and randomized. The reasons for screen failure were not meeting all the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(n=39), withdrawal of consent prior to randomization (n=3), and “other” (n=7).
In the interim analysis, of the 78 randomized patients, 53 were assigned to the pegunigalsidase arm and 25 
to the agalsidase beta arm. All but 1 patient in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm received at least 1 dose of study 
product. During the first year of treatment, 3 patients in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm terminated the study; 
and up to the cut-off date for the interim analysis during the second year, 1 subject from each arm 
discontinued. 
At the time of the cut-off date, 27 (50.9%) and 15 (60%) patients, respectively, had completed the full 24 
months. Reasons for discontinuation were adverse event (2 patients in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm, none in 
the agalsidase beta arm) and voluntary withdrawal (3 and 1, respectively). One of the adverse events that 
led to withdrawal, a drug hypersensitivity reaction, was considered related to study product.

In the final analysis, of the 78 randomized patients, 53 were assigned to the pegunigalsidase alfa and 25 to 
the agalsidase beta arm. All but 1 patient in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm received at least 1 dose of study 
product. A total of 5 patients in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 1 patient in the agalsidase beta arm 
terminated the study prematurely while 48 (90.6%) and 24 (96.0%) patients, respectively, completed the 
24-month study period. Reasons for discontinuation were AE (2 patients in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm, 
none in the agalsidase beta arm) and voluntary withdrawal (3 and 1, respectively). One of the AEs that led to 
withdrawal, a drug hypersensitivity reaction, was considered related to study treatment.
Restrictions related to COVID-19 impacted some patients who were still enrolled in the study during the 
pandemic and could not attend site visits. Some visits had to be rescheduled, which in a few cases caused 
the duration of participation to be prolonged beyond Week 104. During this time, these patients continued to 
receive treatment. Prolongation for this reason occurred for 4 patients: 3 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 
1 in the agalsidase beta arm.
Table 11 Patient disposition – Enrolled set
A total of 704 protocol deviations occurred in the study. All deviations, both major and minor (based on the

1 “Last” treatment refers to patients who had several periods of treatment with agalsidase beta in the past.
2 For one patient in the PRX-102 arm (#33-F20809), due to an error in the reporting in the eCRF, the information on previous treatment 
with agalsidase beta appeared in the Standard Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) as concomitant treatment rather than as past treatment, and 
hence this patient was not captured in the table. The subject had been treated with agalsidase beta for more than 11 years (see Listing 
16.2.3.7.1). The issue was identified after the interim analysis database lock, and will be corrected for the final database lock.

Note: The individual annualized mean change (slope) in eGFR is estimated for each patient with at least 4 eGFR observations using a linear 
regression model and excluding any eGFR values measured during an AKI episode.
Source: Table 14.2.1.5
For the ITT set, the adjusted mean slopes in the ANCOVA were -4.381 for the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and -
3.985 for the agalsidase beta arm, the slope difference was -0.396, and the 95% confidence interval was -
3.999 to 3.207: i.e., again, the lower limit of the CI was less than -3.0 and hence failed to meet the criterion 
for non-inferiority. In the equivalent analysis using the PP population, the slope estimates were -3.280 and -
2.899 with a difference of -0.382 and a 95% CI of -2.666 to 1.903, so here, non-inferiority was nominally 
met.

CI = confidence interval
Note: The analysis is based on an ANCOVA model with eGFR slope of each individual patient as dependent variable, treatment arm and

14.2.1.6.1, Table 14.2.1.6.2
In the analysis using a RI model (similar to the RIRS used for the primary analysis), the slope estimates here 
were -2.571 and -1.786 for the pegunigalsidase  alfa and agalsidase beta arms, respectively. The difference 
was -0.784 with a 95% CI of -2.803 to 1.234.
Using an MMRM model, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in eGFR change from 
baseline between the groups at Week 52 was -5.414, so did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority (Note

that this model does not estimate the slope. Unlike the other models, it does not assume a linear relationship 
between eGFR and time).
It  was  specified  in  the  SAP  that  if  any  patient  experienced  an  episode  of  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI),  eGFR 
assessment was not to be done on any samples that were taken during the episode. There was one occurrence 
of AKI, in a patient in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm. However, this event occurred between sampling visits and 
resolved before the next sample for eGFR determination was taken; accordingly, there were no exclusions from 
the analysis for reasons of AKI. To ensure that there was no impact of AKI on the primary endpoint, a sensitivity 
analysis  for  AKI  identification  was  done  that  implemented  a  criterion  based  on  observed  elevated  serum 
creatinine between consecutive visits. The results of this analysis verified that there was no such impact.
The primary model as well as all the sensitivity analyses (excluding the PP in the two-stage model) are 
summarized in a Forest plot shown in Figure 13.

model. 
RIRS analysis was based on a random intercept random slope longitudinal mixed model with eGFR values at the different time points as 
dependent variable, treatment arm, time, and treatment arm by time interaction as fixed part of the model. Intercept and slopes was also

Change in Stress Test 
Cardiac function was assessed by administering an exercise stress test to evaluate how well the heart 
handled the demands of increased physical activity. Patients underwent this test at baseline and every 52 
weeks.
At week 52: based on those who contributed to data collection (in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm, 29 at 
baseline and 42 at Week 52; in the agalsidase beta arm, 12 and 21, respectively), the percentage of patients 
with normal findings increased from 62.1% to 71.4 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and from 50.0% to 
66.6% in the agalsidase beta arm. 
At week 104: based on those who contributed to data collection (in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm, 29 at 
baseline and 38 at Week 104; in the agalsidase beta arm, 12 and 17, respectively), the percentage of 
patients with normal findings decreased from 62.1% to 57.9% in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and from 
50.0% to 64.7% in the agalsidase beta arm. 
Changes in Echocardiogram
Patients underwent an echocardiogram at baseline and every 52 weeks for the assessment of aortic, mitral, 
pulmonic, and tricuspid functions. The majority of patients were normal at all timepoints and for all 
parameters. However, it is important to note that the echocardiogram procedure was not standardized across 
sites, so the results are difficult to interpret.
 Mainz Severity Score Index
The Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) is used to evaluate the severity and progression of clinical signs of 
Fabry disease, and yields scores for general, neurological, cardiovascular, renal, and overall assessments. An 
overall score of less than 20 points is considered mild, 20 to 40 is considered moderate, and greater than 40 
is considered severe. The MSSI was administered by the Investigator at baseline and every 6 months.

Change in Severity of Pain
The Short Form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is designed to rapidly assess the severity of pain and its impact on 
functioning, and yields scores for “Pain at Its Worst in Last 24 Hours”, “Pain at Its Least in Last 24 Hours”, 
“Pain Right Now”, and “Pain on Average”. The scales are scored from 1 to 10, with a score of 1–4 points 
indicating mild pain, 5–6 indicating moderate, and 7–10 indicating severe. The BPI was administered at 
baseline and every 6 months.
Table 31 shows the change from baseline for the 2 scores “Pain at Its Worst in Last 24 Hours” and “Pain on 
Average”at interim analysis (Week 52) and Table 32 shows the change from baseline at interim analysis 
(Week 104).

Design
Study PB-102-F20 study is a randomized, double-blind, active control study of the 
safety and efficacy of Pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) compared to agalsidase beta 
(Fabrazyme) on renal function in patients with Fabry disease previously treated with 
agalsidase beta.
An Interim Analysis occurred when the last patient completed the 12-month visit 
and uses to support a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission in the 
EU.  The final analysis will occur when the last patient completes the 24-month visit 
and will support a submission to the another regulatory authority.

Integrated analysis of annualised eGFR slope
An integrated analysis of annualised eGFR slope has been generated including data across the development 
program of 1 mg/kg EOW (PB-102-F03, PB-102-F30, PB-102-F20, and PB-102-F60), compared with originally 
naïve patients (PB-102-F03), and across all studies (PB-102F03, PB-102-F30, PB-102-F20, PB-102-F50, PB-
102-F51  and  PB-102-F60),  with  both  the  tested  dose  regimens.  Only  patients  with  at  least  18  months  of 
exposure were included. 
The integrated analysis covers treatment of up to 7.6 years with 1 mg/kg EOW (and up to 3.75 years for 2

PB-102-F51 Open Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of  
pegunigalsidase alfa 2 mg/kg E4W (interim analysis).
Study PB102-F30
Study PB-102-F30, BRIDGE, was an open-label, switch-over study to assess the safety and efficacy of 
pegunigalsidase alfa in adult patients with Fabry disease previously treated with agalsidase alfa (Replagal). 
Patients were screened and evaluated over 3 months while continuing on agalsidase alfa and eligible patients 
were switched from agalsidase alfa to receive IV infusions of pegunigalsidase alfa at 1 mg/kg EOW over a 12-
month duration.
Study  participants  were  aged  between  18-60  years,  male  or  female  with  documented  diagnosis  of  Fabry 
disease; eGFR ≥40 mL/min/1.73 m² by CKD-EPI equation, and treatment with agalsidase alfa for at least 2 
years and on a stable dose (>80% labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months. At least 2 historical serum creatinine 
evaluations since starting agalsidase alfa treatment and not more than 2 years should be available. 
Exclusion Criteria were history of anaphylaxis or Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to agalsidase alfa; history of 
renal  dialysis  or  transplantation;  history  of  acute  kidney  injury  (AKI)  in  the  12  months  prior  to  screening; 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy initiated or dose 
changed in the 4 weeks prior to screening; urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) >0.5 g/g and not treated 
with  an  ACEi  or  ARB;  cardiovascular  event  (myocardial  infarction,  unstable  angina)  in  the  6-month  period 
before screening; congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV and cerebrovascular 
event (stroke, transient ischemic attack) in the 6-month period before screening.
The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  (primary  objective)  and  efficacy  (secondary  objective)  of 
pegunigalsidase alfa in patients with Fabry disease currently treated with agalsidase alfa. Secondary efficacy 
assessment included: mean annualized change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma and urine 
Lyso-Gb3 and plasma Gb3 concentrations, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), urine protein to creatinine ratio 
(UPCR),  frequency  of  pain  medication  use,  exercise  tolerance  (stress  test),  short  form  Brief  Pain  Inventory 
(BPI), Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), Fabry Clinical Events, and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L).
A total of 27 patients were screened, of whom 22 patients (15 males and 7 females) were enrolled and treated. 
Fifteen patients (68.2%) were male, and 7 patients (31.8%) were female. Fourteen of the 15 male patients 
and none of the female patients showed a classic phenotype. Of note, it had been planned to include a maximum 
of  25%  of  female  patients  in  the  study,  although  no  formal  sample  size  calculation  was  performed  for  this 
study.
The mean (SE) annualized eGFR slope in the EP was -5.90 mL/min/1.73 m²/year (1.34) pre-switch and -1.19 
mL/min/1.73 m²/year (1.77) post-switch. The mean (SE) change in annualized eGFR slope from pre- to post-
switch was 4.70 mL/min/1.73 m²/year (2.26; p=0.051, paired t-test). Annualized eGFR slopes were similar 
and  the  changes  in  annualized  eGFR  slope  from  baseline  to  Month  12  were  consistent  in  male  and  female 
patients. 
The  mean  (SE)  cardiac  LVMI  at  baseline  was  above  normal  range  in  male  patients  (97.6  [8.9])  and  within 
normal range in female patients (66.9 [5.8]). At Month 12, the mean LVMI in male patients remained fairly 
stable (98.3 (7.8]) while in female patients the mean LVMi increased by 7.1 g/m² to 74.1 (5.0) but remained 
within normal ranges.

The overall impression of the stress test (exercise tolerance) was normal in 13 patients (65.0%) and not normal 
in 7 patients (35.0%) at baseline and normal in 10 patients (52.6% of patients with data) and not normal in 8 
patients (42.1% of patients with data) at Month 12; for 2 patients (1 with normal and 1 with non-normal results 
at baseline), no stress test results at Month 12 were available. Male patients were more likely to have normal 
stress test results at baseline (10 male patients, 76.9% versus 3 female patients, 42.9%). Only in male patients 
did changes occur from abnormal to normal (2 patients) or from normal to abnormal (4 patient).
A total of 14 patients (70.0%; 9 male patients and 5 female patients) used pain medication at baseline. Two 
patients (10.0%) taking no pain medication at baseline took 1 pain medication at the last visit and 1 patient 
taking a single pain medication at baseline could stop the intake by Month 12 Patients most often used 1 (6 
patients, 30.0%) or 2 (5 patients, 25.0%) pain medications during the study. At a maximum 5 pain 
medications were taken during the study (1 patient, 5.0%). 
The short form BPI results showed no major changes from baseline to Month 12 for the different categories, 
where zero (0) is no pain or interference. At baseline 11 patients (55.0%) had a pain on average score of 
zero or 1, (no or very mild pain). BPI results showed a mean (SE) change in the pain severity mean severity 
score from a baseline value of 1.43 (0.37) to Month 12 of 0.23 (0.21). The baseline value of the mean pain 
interference mean interference score was 1.53 (0.45) and change to Month 12 was and of -0.10 (0.29).
Cardiac (new complete right bundle branch block) and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attack) Fabry 
Clinical Events were each reported in 1 patient (5.0%) in the EP. Both events occurred in the same male 
patient with a previous medical history of transient ischaemic attacks
The EQ-5D-5L descriptive results showed no major changes from baseline to Month 12 in the different 
dimensions. 
PB-102-F50
Study PB-102-F50 was an open label, switch study to assess the safety, efficacy and PK of pegunigalsidase 
alfa 2.0 mg/kg administered by IV infusion E4W for 12 months in adult patients with Fabry disease who were 
previously treated with ERT. Enrolled patients had to have been treated prior to the study with agalsidase 
beta (Fabrazyme) or agalsidase alfa (Replagal) for at least 3 years, and to have been on a stable dose (> 
80% labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months.
Eligible patients included male and female patients aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 60 years with a documented diagnosis 
of Fabry disease who had been treated with agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta for at least 3 years prior to 
inclusion (and for at least 6 months prior to inclusion at a stable dose > 80% labelled dose/kg).
All included patients were required to have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 (according to the Chronic Kidney Disease – Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation); patients with 
a linear negative eGFR slope of ≥ 2 mL/min/1.73 m²/year were excluded.
The objective was to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) of pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-
102) at a dosing regimen of 2.0 mg/kg E4W in patients with Fabry disease currently treated with currently 
commercially available enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta). Efficacy Variables 
included: eGFR CKD-EPI; eGFR slope; Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3); Plasma 
globotriaosylceramide (Gb3); Left ventricular mass index (g/m²) by echocardiogram; Usage of pain 
medication; Stress test; Short Form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI); Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI); Quality 
of life (QoL; EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels Questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L]); Fabry Clinical Events (FCEs). Urine

A total of 52 patients were screened, of whom 30 patients (24 males and 6 females) were enrolled and 
treated. Overall, 29 patients (23 males and 6 females) completed the study; 1 male patient discontinued as 
he withdrew his consent after receiving the first infusion of pegunigalsidase alfa 2.0 mg/kg.
The pegunigalsidase alfa dosing regimen was changed to 1.0 mg/kg E2W for 1 patient.
In all 30 enrolled and treated patients, the mean (SD) age was 40.5 (11.3) years, median 40.5 years, ranging 
from 19 to 58 years of age. Twenty-four (80.0%) patients were male and 6 (20.0%) patients were female, in 
line with the plan to include ~20% female patients in the study. Mean (SD) eGFR at baseline was 99.89 (22.08) 
mL/min/1.73 m² overall and was slightly higher in male (101.19 [23.38] mL/min/1.73 m2) than female (94.69 
[16.55] mL/min/1.73 m2) patients. Mean (SD) annualized eGFR slope pre-switch was -1.84 (3.66) mL/min/1.73 
m²/year  overall.  Patients  with  a  linear  slope  more  negative  than  -2  mL/min/1.73  m²/year,  calculated  using 
historical values and screening values, were excluded from the study at screening.
The efficacy population included 29 patients (23 males and 6 females). One patient who was excluded from 
the efficacy population discontinued the study (withdrew consent) after the first infusion, but prior to any 
post-baseline efficacy evaluation. Mean absolute eGFR values over time generally remained relatively stable 
during the study, with values of 99.44 (n=29) and 100.65 mL/min/1.73 m² (n=28) at baseline and Week 52, 
respectively. See Figure 18.

Data for quantitative echocardiography evaluations, e.g., LVMI, had substantial variations. In addition, in this 
study the echocardiograms were not performed in a standardized manner and/or read centrally. 
Other  evaluated  endpoints  (Pain  medication,  Short  Form  Brief  Pain  Inventory,  Mainz  Severity  Score  Index, 
Quality of Life) were overall stable during the study. Only 1 patient (non-classic Fabry disease); previous ERT 
of agalsidase beta who was taking 1 pain medication at baseline was taking ≥ 2 medications by the last visit. 
Data at baseline, week 52 are presented further below with the interim extension study data (up to week 108).
Study PB102-F51
Study PB102-F51 is an ongoing open label, extension study that evaluates the safety and efficacy parameters 
of pegunigalsidase alfa 2.0 mg/kg E4W in adult Fabry patients who successfully completed Study PB-102-F50.  
Patients  were  enrolled  to  receive  2.0  mg/kg  E4W  as  an  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  for  up  to  36  months  (per 
protocol  Version  3.0)  or  until  marketing  approval  for  pegunigalsidase  alfa  is  obtained  and  the  treatment  is 
available in the patients’ country or until study is terminated.  In the case of clear clinical deterioration, the 
treatment regimen may be changed to 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (E2W) at the Investigator’s discretion and 
after  discussion  with  the  Medical  Monitor.  Patients  who  completed  study  PB-102-F50  were  enrolled  to  this 
study.
All 29 enrolled patients are ongoing in Study PB-102-F51 at the time of this interim analysis cut-off date of 08 
August 2021. Twenty-seven patients are receiving PRX-102 at 2 mg/kg E4W, while the PRX-102 dosing regimen 
has been changed to 1.0 mg/kg E2W for 2 patients: one patient was switched at Week 40 (V11) during Study 
PB-102-F50 and continued with the 1.0 mg/kg E2W regimen during this extension study; and another patient 
was switched at Week 84 (V22) (during Study PB-102-F51).
The safety population consisted of all patients who received any dose (partial or complete) of pegunigalsidase 
alfa as part of this PB-102-F51 study. All safety analyses were based on this population.
The efficacy population consisted of all patients who received any dose of pegunigalsidase alfa as part of this 
study. Only efficacy data collected while on the 2.0 mg/kg E4W regimen were included in the efficacy tables. 
For the patients who switched to the 1.0 mg/kg E2W dosing regimen, efficacy data collected after the switch 
were listed only.
All 29 patients included in the study were white of which 1 patient was Hispanic/Latino. A total of 23 (79.3%) 
patients were male and 6 (20.7%) patients were female. The mean (SD) age was 40.9 (11.3) years, ranging 
from 19 to 58 years. The most common Fabry disease symptoms/presentations were acroparesthesias, heat 
intolerance, angiokeratomas and hypohydrosis. The efficacy population included 29 patients with available 
efficacy data (23 males and 6 females).
A total of 15 (51.7%) patients were treated with ACEi and/or ARBs at any timepoint during the study. Of these, 
10 patients were already being treated with ACEi/ARB at study entry and 5 patients started treatment during 
the study. Of the 10 patients already being treated at study entry, 8 patients continued treatment at a stable 
dose throughout the study.
The baseline characteristics of the study population indicated that the population was likely to be more variable 
than expected. This variability is possibly reflected in the heterogenicity of the observed eGFR results and the

impacted  by  some  methodological  limitation  for  the  eGFR  pre-switch  slope  calculation  (e.g.,  creatinine 
assessments used coming from different laboratories and at varied intervals).
The  mean  absolute  eGFR  value  at  baseline  (Study  PB-102-F50)  in  the  efficacy  population  was  99.44 
mL/min/1.73 m2 and was slightly higher in male patients than female patients (100.68 and 94.69 mL/min/1.73

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Over the course of the procedure, the applicant submitted the following studies/data:
•
A Phase 1/2 study in adult ERT-naïve or off-ERT for 6 months Fabry patients; PB-102-F01/F02 
followed by an extension study (PB-102-F03);
•
Interim and Final results of a Phase 3 main study in previously ERT-treated adult Fabry patients after 
switch from Fabrazyme (PB-102-F20);
•
A Phase 3 supportive study in previously ERT-treated adult Fabry patients after switch from Replagal 
(PB-102-F30);
•
A Phase 3 supportive study investigating the alternative dose of 2.0 mg/kg E4W in ERT pre-treated 
patients (PB-102-F50);

Interim report of an open label extension study to evaluate long term safety and efficacy of 
Pegunigalsidase Alfa (PRX-102) 2.0 mg/kg E4W (PB-102-F51).
The proposed indication is: “Elfabrio is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in adult patients 
with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease (deficiency of alpha-galactosidase).”
STUDY PB102-20 (Interim and Final analyses)
STUDY PB-102-20 was a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, active control study examining efficacy and 
safety of pegunigalsidase alfa in adult Fabry disease patients with impaired renal function and previously 
treated with agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme).
During the EMA scientific advice meeting in December 2015 [EMA SA, 2015] it was acknowledged that a 12- 
month  interim  analysis  could  constitute  a  pivotal  evidence  for  efficacy,  if  all  aspects  of  the  study  were 
appropriately designed. The applicant consequently used the 12-month interim analysis as primary objective 
of the EU submission.
In the original planned study, the primary final analysis was a test for superiority over Fabrazyme at 24 
months to support the requirement of another regulatory authority and was considered as a secondary 
objective for the EU dossier. During the procedure, the final clinical study report of PB-102-F20 was 
submitted. The CHMP noted a change in the objective of the final (24-month) analysis from superiority to 
non-inferiority and a change in the primary analysis model (from a random intercept random slope “RIRS” 
longitudinal mixed model comparing adjusted means of eGFR slopes to a quantile regression comparing 
medians of eGFR slopes) from the original SAP.
Currently 3 products are registered for adult patients with Fabry disease: 2 ERTs agalsidase beta 
(Fabrazyme) and agalsidase alfa (Replagal) and a pharmacological chaperon (migalastat [Galafold]). The use 
of an active comparator (agalsidase beta) is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The population included in this study is considered adequately selected:
-
-
the population covers female and male patients with classic and non-classic Fabry disease, with renal 
function deterioration (Linear slope of eGFR more negative than -2 mL/min/1.73 m²);
no more than 50% of patients were female which is appropriate since the disease expresses 
differently in males and females, and the symptoms are usually milder in females.

Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either receive pegunigalsidase alfa 1 mg/kg EOW or to continue 
agalsidase beta at the same dosage and interval as previously and patients were previously treated with 
agalsidase beta with a high compliance.
The primary endpoint was the annualised estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR (defined using the CKD-
EPI, Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration formula) over time  or so called annualised eGFR 
slope. The baseline slope was determined based on at least 3 historical serum creatinine values over 
approximately 1 year. The selection of the primary endpoint was based on experience from pre-clinical 
studies and the clinical phase I/II study, this endpoint was also chosen in the phase III study for the latest 
approved EU product in this indication (migalastat) and is considered acceptable by the CHMP.
Secondary endpoints included plasma and urine Lyso-Gb3 and plasma Gb3 concentrations, left ventricular 
mass index (LVMI), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), frequency of pain medication use, exercise 
tolerance, short form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), Fabry Clinical Events, 
quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and biomarkers and are considered relevant to support the efficacy of 
pegunigalsidase alfa.
The sample size calculation was based on superiority and non-inferiority hypotheses and these elements of the 
study  design  raised  CHMP  major  concerns.  Indeed,  in  the  non-inferiority  objective,  any  treatment  effect  of 
which magnitude does not exceed 3 mL/min/1.73 m²/year is considered as not clinically relevant, according to 
the non-inferiority margin in the trial. On the other hand, both non-inferiority and superiority objectives are 
targeting  the  same  1.1  mL/min/1.73  m²/year  difference  in  favour  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa  considered  as  a 
clinically  relevant  treatment  effect  in  the  superiority  settings.  However,  when  considering  the  clinical 
assumptions set in the protocol (pegunigalsidase alfa =-1.9, agalsidase=-3.0, ∆=1.1, sd =1.5 and 66 subjects), 
the magnitude of the targeted treatment effect seems to be within a range of non-clinically relevant values, 
according to the 95% confidence limits of the point estimate of the difference ∆ ([0.32; 1.88]) and the non-
inferiority margin. Given the treatment effect expected in favour of pegunigalsidase alfa for superiority as well 
as non-inferiority objectives (1.1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year), the trial would have had more than 90% power to 
achieve the non-inferiority with a margin as small as -0.5 or -0.25 mL/min/1.73 m²/year.
The CHMP concluded that the design of the main Study PB-102-F20 was considered inadequate to test the non-
inferiority (NI) of Elfabrio vs. its comparator. The prespecified NI margin was based on the absolute effect of 
the  comparator  in  one  experience,  rather  than  on  retaining  a  modicum  of  its  effect  in  comparison  to  no 
treatment. First, this NI margin (-3 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) implies that a loss of efficacy of PRX-102 over the 
comparator  as  high  as  three  times  the  expected  gain  in  efficacy  (+1  mL/min/1.73  m²/year)  has  no  clinical 
relevance. Second, the key clinical data of the approval of algasidase beta (Fabrazyme) was the superiority 
over untreated patients with a mean eGFR slope difference of 1.7 mL/min/1.73 m2/year within a 95% CI of 
[0.5, 3.0]. This result shows that the maximum gain in efficacy can reach 3 mL/min/1.73 m2/year as compared 
to  untreated  patients  and  therefore  makes  difficult  to  understand  how  a  maximum  gain  in  efficacy  can  be 
considered as a negligible loss of efficacy in a non-inferiority trial. Thus, available evidence on the effect of 
Fabrazyme over no treatment indicate that a robust NI margin would need to be so small, that this would be 
prohibitive  with  respect  to  sample  size.  Further,  the  different  data  cited  on  the  effect  of  Fabrazyme  from 
different sources, indicate that “constancy of assumptions” may not be mandated and thus, the presented main 
trial  is  an  experiment  that  could  only  have  established  the  efficacy  of  Elfabrio  if  superior  efficacy  had  been 
shown, which was not the case.

Subsequently, additional available pharmacodynamics and efficacy analyses were presented by the applicant 
and the CHMP considered the presented results to conclude on the efficacy based on the totality of the 
evidence. See further details below.
PB-102-F01/ PB-102-F02 / PB-102-F03 
Dose selection for the main Phase 3 was based on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics/biomarker, efficacy, 
and safety data from study PB-102-F01/ PB-102-F02 /PB-102-F03. 
This study was the only one to have included ERT-naive patients.
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different dosages (0.2; 1.0 and 2.0 
mg/kg QOW) of pegunigalsidase alfa in patients with Fabry disease. Secondary objectives included pK and 
exploratory efficacy endpoints.
Inclusion criteria were male and female Fabry disease patients who were required to either be ERT-naïve or 
to have not received ERT within the last 6 months.
Only descriptive statistics for continuous variables (mean and its standard error, standard deviation, median 
and range) were presented as efficacy results.
PB-102-F30
Additional evidence of efficacy in patients treated with agalsidase alfa came from Study PB-102-F30, BRIDGE, 
which was an open-label, switch study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa in adult 
Fabry disease patients treated with the other currently commercially available ERT agalsidase alfa (Replagal).
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) 
of pegunigalsidase alfa. Efficacy objectives comprised mean annualized change in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) and also renal, cardiac, pain, quality of life and PD evaluations.
Inclusion criteria were male and female patient with Fabry disease. Patients had to have been receiving 
agalsidase alfa for at least 2 years and a stable dose (>80% of the labelled dose/kg) for at least 6 months. 
Only descriptive statistics for continuous variables (mean and its standard error, standard deviation, median 
and range) were presented for efficacy. A subgroup analysis of patients with classic Fabry, males and females 
was conducted.
PB-102-F50 
Evidence regarding an alternative dose regimen (2.0 mg/kg E4W) came from Study PB-102-F50 which was 
an open label, switch over study aimed to assess the safety, efficacy and PK of pegunigalsidase 2.0 mg/kg 
administered by IV infusion E4W for 12 months in adult patients with Fabry disease previously treated with 
ERT.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of an alternative dosing regimen as a 
maintenance therapy in patients currently treated with ERT. Efficacy objectives comprised mean annualized 
change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and also renal, cardiac, pain, quality of life and PD 
evaluations.
The study aimed to enrol a population with a milder Fabry disease and therefore, unlike the main study, 
patients with a linear eGFR of ≤ -2 mL/min/1.73 m²/year were excluded.

STUDY PB102-51
The study aimed to enrol patients who had completed treatment with pegunigalsidase alfa in Study PB-102-
F50 for an additional 36-month treatment period.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the long term safety and efficacy of pegunigalsidase 2.0 mg/kg 
administered by IV infusion E4W. Efficacy objectives comprised mean annualized change in estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and also renal, cardiac, pain, quality of life and PD evaluations

Efficacy data and additional analyses
STUDY PB102-20 
Interim analysis (Month 12) 
A total of 127 subjects were assessed for inclusion and 78 were enrolled and randomized. At 12 months, The 
PP population comprised 74 patients (49 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 25 in the agalsidase beta arm). 
At baseline, males outnumbered females in both arms, but with a disparity between arms. The number of 
male patients was lower in the pegunigalsidase alfa 29 (55.8%) arm than in the in the agalsidase beta arm 
18 (72.0%). Since the disease expresses differently in males and females, and as the symptoms are usually 
milder in females this imbalance may result in a bias.
Characteristic data at baseline suggest that the proportion of patients with a more severe form of the disease 
was greater in the agalsidase arm:
-
the overall mean (SE) eGFR was 73.33 (2.26) mL/min/1.73 m² with comparable means. However, 
the proportion of patients with a more pronounced decline in kidney function, as measured by an 
annualised eGFR slope below -5 was higher in the agalsidase alfa arm than in the pegunigalsidase 
alfa arm (80.0% and 63.5% respectively);
- more patients were taking ACEi or ARB medications in the agalsidase beta arm than the 
pegunigalsidase alfa arm (64.0% and 51.9% respectively).
Around one third of patients had ADAs directed against the product to which they have been exposed: 34.6% 
of the patients were positive for pegunigalsidase alfa antibodies and 32.0% of the patients were positive for 
agalsidase beta antibodies. All patients had been on agalsidase beta prior to enrolment and as the protein 
structure of the two products are the same it is likely that the positive results for pegunigalsidase alfa 
antibodies were due to antibody cross-reactivity. 
At Month 12, the estimated eGFR slopes were -2.507 for the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and -1.748 for the 
agalsidase beta arm in favour of agalsidase beta [difference -0.749 (-3.026; 1.507)]. For the per-protocol 
population, the LS mean annualised eGFR estimated slope (95%CI) was -2.403 (-3.714; -1.093) 
mL/min/1.73m², for the pegunigalsidase alfa compared to -1.755 (-3.556; -0.056) mL/min/1.73m² for the 
agalsidase beta group with a difference of -0.648 (-2.883 to 1.587) in favour of algalsidase beta. 
The non-inferiority criterion was not met for the ITT set since the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval 
(CI) had to be greater than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -3.0. Indeed, the 95% CI for the 
Assessment report

Page 114/170
difference in slopes was -3.026 to 1.507. Since non-inferiority could not be demonstrated for the primary 
endpoint, all subsequently planned statistical tests for the secondary endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy 
could not be carried out under adequate control of the experiment-wise type-1-error. Thus, from a 
methodological/statistical point of view, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the efficacy of pegunigalsidase 
alfa as compared to that of agalsidase beta and moreover the data do not allow to clearly quantify the effect 
of pegunigalsidase alfa.
The evolution of the annualised eGFR slope before and after randomisation in the study shared the same 
pattern in both arms:  -8.08 (0.91) mL/min/1.73m² at baseline and -2.57 (95CI -3.835;-1.180) 
mL/min/1.73m² at month 12 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm; -8.48 (0.95) mL/min/1.73m² at baseline and -
1.74 (95CI -3.585;-0.089) mL/min/1.73m² at month 12 in the agalsidase beta arm. However, the intra-
patient comparisons are fraught with uncertainty due to likely regression to the mean therefore the 
comparison of pre- baseline and post- baseline eGFR slopes may be biased. Indeed, the reliability of the data 
used to evaluate the pre-baseline slopes eGFR is debatable as historical data were obtained at screening 
through standard local laboratory procedures, whereas creatinine values within the study were obtained using 
an enzymatic assay performed at a central laboratory.
Separate presentation of results on biomarkers of Fabry disease for the different ADA-subgroups (Study F-20 
only) seemed as if no effect of ADA development were on these efficacy outcomes. Difference in plasma Lyso 
Gb3 levels in male and female patients might have impact on the plasma Lyso Gb3 results in ADA-positive or 
induced ADA patients, if there are female patients in the ADA-positive/induced ADA subgroups and difference 
in Lyso-Gb3 induced by the ADA development might be masked by the intersexual differences. Thus no 
conclusions could be drawn to a possible advantage of pegunigalsidase alfa on the drug immunogenicity 
profile (see further discussion on safety).
Final analysis (Month 24)
At 24 months, the PP population comprised 72 patients (48 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 24 in the 
agalsidase beta arm) and the ITT population comprised 77 patients (52 in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 
25 in the agalsidase beta arm). 
At month 24, an improvement in eGFR slope was observed in patients treated with pegunigalsidase alfa with 
a mean eGFR slope of -2.5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year at month 24 compared to -8.03 mL/min/1.73 m²/year 
before switch indicating less deterioration in renal function. The mean difference in the estimated slopes 
between pegunigalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta at month 24 was: -0.359 with a 95% CI [-2.444 ; 1.726] 
in the ITT population and -0.118 with a 95% CI [-2.450 ; 2.213] in the PP population.

mg/kg arms (4 males and 2 females each) but only 4 patients were included in 2.0 mg/kg group (3 females, 
1 male) as the Applicant decided to stop enrolment in the 2.0 mg/kg treatment group. According to the 
Applicant, the decision to stop recruitment was based on PK data and not on safety issue. Considering the 
gender imbalance between the treatment arms, the 2.0 mg/kg arm cannot be compared to the other two 
arms. At Month 12, the percent reduction from baseline in Lyso-Gb3 was greater in the 1.0 mg/kg arm 
(mean -51.6 ng/mL; -59.9%) compared to the 0.2 mg/kg arm reduction (mean -59.7 ng/ml (-43.4%). 
Analysis of the renal Gb3 inclusions showed reduction in BLISS score from baseline in patients receiving 
pegunigalsidase alfa. No clear dose/effect relationship could be observed since the applicant only provided 
descriptive results.

The study showed a positive trend (stabilisation or improvement). The results are complicated to interpret due 
to  the  lack  of  a  control  arm  and  concerns  about  the  reliability  of  the  historical  data  used  to  calculate  the 
annualized  eGFR  slope  observed  in  the  main  study.  Considering  the  underlying  disease  mechanism  and  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  pegunigalsidase  alfa,  this  study  could  be  considered  sufficient  for  a  switch  from 
agalsidase alfa to pegunigalsidase alfa provided that the main phase data allow to conclude on the efficacy of 
pegunigalsidase alfa in patients with Fabry disease. Overall, 22 patients were included in this efficacy population 
(15 males and 7 females) versus Replagal. Fourteen of the 15 male patients and none of the female patients 
had classic Fabry disease. Renal function was assessed via eGRF and Annualized Estimated eGRF Slope (as in 
the main study versus Fabrazyme).
Overall  the  eGFR  from  baseline  to  Month  12  decreased  by  -2.56  (2.14)  mL/min/1.73  m².  The  mean  (SE) 
annualized  eGFR  slope  was  -5.90  mL/min/1.73  m²/year  (1.34)  pre-switch  and  -1.19  mL/min/1.73  m²/year 
(1.77) post-switch indicating improvement of 4.70 mL/min/1.73 m2/year (2.26; p=0.051, paired t-test).
Regarding  the  cardiac  function  evaluation  (LVMI  and  stress  test),  a  slight  increase  in  LMVI  was  observed. 
Proportion of patients showing a normal stress test decreased from 65.0% at BL to 52.6% at Month 12. Similarly 
to the main study F-20, the increase of LVMI was numerically greater in female patients than in males, but 
remained within normal ranges from BL to study completion in female patients.
PB 102-F50
Data for an alternative dosing regimen (2.0 mg/kg/Q4W) come from an open-label phase 3, switch study 
evaluating safety (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of this new regimen in patients 
pretreated with ERTs. This alternative regimen was never tested in the dose finding studies and it is difficult 
to draw any conclusion taking into account the lack of a control arm and concerns about the reliability of the 
historical data used to calculate the annualized eGFR slope as acknowledged by the Applicant.
Overall, 29 patients (23 males and 6 females) completed this open label study aiming at assessing the 2.0 
mg/kg IV every 4 weeks regimen (instead of 1.0 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks which was the dose regimen 
chosen for the main study).
Per protocol, patients with a negative eGFR slope of ≥ 2 mL/min/1.73 m²/year at screening (based on 
historical and screening values) were excluded. However, at baseline eGFR slopes (based on historical, 
screening and baseline values) negative eGFR slope of ≥ 2 were observed in some populations such as 
female patients, patients previously treated with agalsidase alfa, patients with non-classic Fabry disease and 
patients with an eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². This data again raises the question of the accuracy of historical 
data.
The mean (SE) annualized eGFR slope values slightly decreased from -1.79 (0.69) mL/min/1.73 m²/year pre-
switch to -2.92 (1.05)mL/min/1.73 m²/year post-switch showing a more negative eGFR slope post-swich. 
These results may have been biased by the possible unreliability of the historical data used to calculate the 
pre-switch slope.
In the efficacy population, the absolute eGFR values slightly decreased during the 52-week treatment period 
with pegunigalsidase alfa, with a mean (SE) change from baseline at 52 weeks of -1.27 (1.37) mL/min/1.73 
m².
The cardiac function was generally stable over the study, with no major changes observed in qualitative 
echocardiography assessments. However these were not performed in a standardized manner and/or read

centrally. No major changes in pain perception was observed over the treatment period, no major changes 
were observed in the EQ-5D-5L descriptive results or overall health score.
Overall, the data from this study does not allow to draw a conclusion on the efficacy of this alternative dosing 
regimen for the following reasons:



this was an open-label, uncontrolled study design;
efficacy data were only descriptive;
there were uncertainties about the accuracy of the historical data used to calculate the pre-switch 
slope, which makes the evolution of pre and post switch eGFR slopes comparison questionable.
STUDY PB102-F51
Further data for an alternative dosing regimen (2.0 mg/kg/Q4W) come from interim results of an open-label 
extension study evaluating safety, efficacy and PK of this new regimen in patients previously treated in study 
PB102-F50.
Overall, 29 patients (23 males and 6 females) were included all were treated for at least 108 weeks and 2 
patients switched to the 1.0 mg/kg E2W dosing regimen. 
For exploratory efficacy endpoints, the baseline values were defined as those collected at baseline in Study 
PB-102-F50. Thus, results at week 52 are those of the end of the study PB102-F50.
The mean (SE) annualized eGFR slope values stayed stable from -2.92 (1.05)mL/min/1.73 m²/year at 
baseline to -2.77 (0.54) mL/min/1.73 m²/year during treatment.
The eGFR decreased from baseline to Week 108 with mean (SE) change from baseline -5.10 (1.96) 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at Week 108.
The pain severity, the Mainz severity score index and the EQ-5D-5L remained generally stable from baseline 
to Week 108.
Regarding PD, comparison with Fabrazyme is not relevant for justifying the E4W posology. Furthermore, the 
provided population PK models is not endorsed and those data should not be used to characterise and predict 
the PK of pegunigalsidase alfa and are not accepted to be used to draw any conclusion on the PK, PK/PD and 
exposure-response behaviour of the compound and to recommend the Q4W posology.
Additional analyses
An integrated analysis of annualised eGFR slope including data across the development program of 1 mg/kg 
EOW, compared with originally naïve patients, and across all studies, with both the tested dose regimens has 
been generated. Only patients with at least 18 months of exposure were included. The integrated analysis 
covers treatment of up to 7.6 years with 1 mg/kg EOW. The mean eGFR slope was -2.80 mL/min/1.73 
m²/year in the overall population as well as in the 1 mg/kg EOW dosing and -2.56 mL/min/1.73 m²/year in 
previously untreated patients.
In further additional analyses, most patients maintained normal or near normal Left ventricular mass index 
(LVMI) values throughout the studies. Mean changes were small and did not suggest deterioration of LVMI 
values over treatment. The severity of Fabry disease signs and symptoms according to the Mainz Severity 
Score Index (MSSI) and average pain severity remained stable in the switch studies.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The CHMP concluded that no confirmatory evidence of efficacy as measured by the annualised Glomerular 
Filtration Rate (eGFR) can be retrieved from the main study given that the primary objective was not met. 
Despite this, pegunigalsidase alfa is a known active substance used as enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry 
disease with a well-understood mechanism of action. The pharmacodynamic effects of Elfabrio observed on 
renal tissue would not be expected without effective ERT, this is further supported by the observed clinical 
effect on the renal function at month 24.  Taking into account the totality of the data, the CHMP concluded 
that efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa has been shown in adult patients with Fabry disease (deficiency of alpha-
galactosidase) in the proposed dosing regimen (1 mg/kg/EOW). Subsequent to the assessment of the data 
related to the (2 mg/kg/Q4W), the applicant withdrew this claim and subsequently no information in this 
dosing regimen should be included in the SmPC.

Overall, cumulative exposure amounted to 4874.71 patient months (about 406 patient years in Cohort 3). 
Maximum individual exposure was 91 months; ISS Table 5.1.3).
Most of the exposure was from treatment with 1 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa EOW (Cohort 1: 3519.77 patient 
months; about 293.3 patient years). Exposure to the alternative dose of 2 mg/kg E4W, albeit lower, was still

Table 66 Summary of system organ class disorders seen in >25% of patients in a group – Safety set
In  the  pegunigalsidase  alfa  arm,  7  severe  events  in  5  patients  were  considered  serious:  aortic  stenosis, 
bronchitis,  acute  kidney  injury  and  dehydration,  atrioventricular  block  second  degree  and  protein-losing 
gastroenteropathy, and hypersensitivity. The event of hypersensitivity occurred during the first infusion, and 
was considered related to study product. (The patient remained in the study but experienced another event of 
drug hypersensitivity during the second infusion, this time of moderate intensity, and then withdrew from the 
study.) The time to onset of the other severe SAEs ranged from 113 days to 516 days.
The event of protein-losing gastroenteropathy was still ongoing as of the cut-off date for the interim analysis 
(no  update  was  provided  in  the  final  analysis).  All  other  events  of  severe  intensity  were  non-serious,  were 
considered unrelated to study product, and resolved, including the serious event of hypersensitivity.
In the agalsidase beta arm, 8 severe events in 4 patients were considered serious: acute respiratory failure 
and altered state of consciousness, pneumonia and sepsis, ventricular tachycardia and suicidal ideation, and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chest pain. The time to onset of these events ranged from 354 days 
to 729 days. None were considered related to study product. As of the cut-off date, the event of sepsis was 
still ongoing; all other events had resolved.
The only TEAEs of severe intensity that were considered related to study product were the serious event of 
hypersensitivity, described above, and a non-serious renal event of glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative 
in a pegunigalsidase alfa patient, from which the patient was still recovering as of the cut-off date.

Hypersensitivity related events
Related SAEs were reported for 5 patients, all in Cohort 1. Among them, 4 were indicative of hypersensitivity 
reactions: a case of severe Bronchospasm (IgE mediated hypersensitivity reaction) in study PB-102-F01, 2 
cases of Type I hypersensitivity in study PB-102-F30, and a case of hypersensitivity in study PB-102-F20, 
which all occurred during the first infusion of study treatment.
Renal events
A related severe case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis was reported for a patient treated with 
pegunigalsidase alfa in Study PB-102-F20. To investigate the patient’s persistent proteinuria, a kidney biopsy 
had been performed which confirmed immune complex mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
with subendothelial IgG deposits as well as lambda and kappa immunoglobulin deposits. Immune complexes 
found in capillary and endothelial cells tested positive for alpha galactosidase. This severe TEAE led to 
interruption of treatment but not to study discontinuation. This patient experienced 14 other AEs, including a 
moderate event of proteinuria on Day 550.
Infusion Related Reactions
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) were defined as TEAEs that occurred during an infusion or within 2 hours 
after its completion, and whose causality was assessed as definitely, probably, or possibly related to study 
treatment. IRRs do not include injection site reactions (ISRs), which are considered to be related to the 
procedure rather than the study drug.

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings
In summary, a limited number of patients experienced deteriorations in laboratory parameters while treated 
with pegunigalsidase alfa. Only 3 related TEAEs in 2 patients based on laboratory parameter were reported; 
these were increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) and increased white blood cell count in 1 patient 
in Study PB-102-F50, and hepatic enzyme increased in another patient also in Study PB-102-F50.
Electrocardiogram Data
As is expected in the Fabry Disease population [Namdar 2016], clinically significant changes in ECG during 
the study were infrequently documented on case report forms (CRFs) based on locally performed ECG 
procedures. In none of the studies were meaningful safety signals detected based on the assessment of ECG 
parameters.
No safety signals emerged from the cardiac MRI assessments in the studies.
Brain MRI
In studies PB-102-F01/F02/F03, PB-102-F20, and PB-102-F50, no evidence of stroke was detected in 
patients’ MRIs of the brain at Baseline and throughout the study.
In study PB-102-F30, abnormal findings at baseline only were reported for 1 patient (with evidence of stroke) 
and abnormal findings at baseline and at Month 12 were reported for 1 further patient (evidence of stroke). 
No further abnormal findings were reported.
Vital Signs
In the PB-102-F01 and PB-102-F02 studies, the majority of the vital signs measurements (systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, temperature, and respiration rate) were within normal range. One 
female patient in the 1.0 mg/kg treatment group experienced 3 possibly/probably treatment-related events 
of hypotension, 2 of which were IRRs (transient, and resolved the same day).

In the PB-102-F30 study, there were no notable changes in the vital sign variables in the Safety population 
during the study.
In the PB-102-F20 study and the PB-102-F50 study, there were no findings of note for vital signs.
Vital sign analyses are currently not available for the ongoing studies PB-102-F60 and PB-102-F51.
Physical Examination Findings
The most common abnormal physical examination results in the PB-102-F01 and PB-102-F02 studies at the 
end  of  study  were  in  skin  (0.2  mg/kg,  66.7%;  1.0  mg/kg,  83.3%;  2.0  mg/kg,  50.0%  of  patients)  and 
neurological body systems (0.2 mg/kg, 16.7%; 1.0 mg/kg, 16.7%; 2.0 mg/kg, 25.0% of patients). In PB-102-
F03 at Month 24 the most common abnormal physical examination results were in skin (63.6% of patients), 
neurological and musculoskeletal (each 27.3% of patients), and head, eyes, ears, nose, throat (HEENT) and 
cardiovascular body systems (each 18.2% of patients).
The most common abnormal physical examination results in PB-102-F30 at Month 12 were also in skin (45.0% 
of patients), cardiovascular (each 15.0% of patients) and HEENT (10.0% of patients) body systems.
The most common abnormal physical examination results in PB-102-F50 at Month 12 were also in skin (75% 
of patients) and HEENT (25%).
There were no findings of note for physical examinations in PB-102-F20.
Physical examination analyses are currently not available for the ongoing studies PB-102-F60 and PB-102-F51.
In  study  PB-102-F20,  6  different  laboratory-related  TEAEs  were  seen  in  at  least  2  patients  within 
pegunigalsidase alfa group, while in the agalsidase beta arm, the only one seen in more than a single patient 
was increased blood creatinine. No events were rated as serious; only one event, decreased glomerular filtration 
rate in a patient in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm (1.9%), was assessed as severe; and only one, a mild event 
of increased urine/albumin ratio in a patient in the agalsidase beta arm (4.0%), was considered possibly related 
to study treatment. See Table 75.

2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations
Intrinsic Factors
Subgroup analyses of safety data by age, race, or ethnic group were not conducted. Considering the overall 
small sample size, subgroups would have limited numbers of patients and it was expected that results would 
be difficult to interpret.
An exposure adjusted subgroup analysis of TEAEs by gender suggested a trend for higher reporting rates for 
any, related, severe, related severe, and serious TEAEs in male patients compared to female patients, as 
expected based on gender-specific differences in pathophysiology of the disease.
Extrinsic Factors
An exposure adjusted subgroup analysis of TEAEs by ADA status suggested a trend for higher reporting rates 
especially for related, severe, and serious TEAEs in ADA positive, followed by ADA induced patients, 
compared to ADA negative patients. 
No safety analyses by renal impairment or hepatic impairment were performed. While study PB-102-F20 
includes patients with renal impairment (screening eGFR 40 to 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 and linear negative 
slope of eGFR of at least 2 mL/min/1.73 m2), no data in patients with severe renal or severe hepatic 
impairment are available.
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation
There is limited available data on pegunigalsidase alfa use in pregnant women to determine the drug-
associated risk.
There is no data on the presence of pegunigalsidase alfa in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant 
or the effects on milk production.
In the current program for pegunigalsidase alfa, 2 pregnancies have been reported despite a requirement for 
contraception. One was reported in study PB-102-F03, the patient had normal ultrasound findings at week 13 
of gestation but decided to terminate the pregnancy at week 14 for personal reasons. Another pregnancy in 
the ongoing Study PB-102-F60 was reported. The pregnancy occurred after more than 5 years of treatment 
with pegunigalsidase alfa in Studies PB-102-F01/02/03 and PB-102-F60 and led to discontinuation from the 
study. The pregnancy resulted in the birth of a healthy baby at gestational week 40.
Overdose
There have been no reports of overdose with pegunigalsidase alfa. In clinical trials, patients received doses 
up to 2.0 mg/kg body weight.
Withdrawal and Rebound
No evidence of withdrawal or rebound was observed.
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events
Pre-existing and induced anti- pegunigalsidase alfa antibodies were observed in the clinical studies.

The development of anti-pegunigalsidase alfa IgG and neutralising anti-pegunigalsidase alfa ADA over time is 
presented in for Cohorts 1, 2 and 4. Immunogenicity assessments were performed following a multi-tiered 
approach, thus further ADA assessments (including tests for neutralising antibodies) were only performed in 
IgG-positive patients. See Table 76.

In the main study PB-102-F20, two patients, both in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm, experienced TEAEs that 
led to withdrawal from the study; none in the agalsidase beta arm.
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience
As claimed by the applicant, pegunigalsidase alfa has not been marketed in any country.
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
The safety database includes patients with Fabry disease from two Phase 1/2 dose finding studies followed by 
an extension study, one main Phase 3 study and two supportive Phase 3 studies, one evaluating an alternative 
dose/regimen and one enrolling patients previously treated with Replagal. The safety data from all these clinical 
trials are pooled, which is understood given the low number of participants per study. Additionally, considering 
that there are no major discrepancies in selection criteria across the trials, the method is acceptable. 
Comparative  data  are  available  for  the  1  mg/kg  dose  EOW  from  the  main  Phase  3  study  (PB-102-F20),  a 
controlled trial using Fabrazyme (ERT administered EOW) as comparator. However, this is not the case for the 
2 mg/kg dose E4W.
Assessment report 
Error! Unknown document property name.
Page 154/170
The number of patients naïve of any ERT treatments enrolled in the clinical program is quite low (i.e. n=17). 
Moreover, all those have been received 1 mg/kg dose EOW, none have been treated with the 2 mg/kg dose 
E4W.
More generally, the extent of the exposure for the high dose (n=30; 92.5 patients-year) is rather limited 
compared to the low dose (n=111; 293.3 patients-year). Likewise, long term data are scarce for these 
2mg/kg dose E4W (n=17 at Month 30), although interim data from the extension study PB-102-F51 during 
the procedure.
In the overall safety population (n=142), TEAE were reported in 93.7% of the subjects with a rate of 480.5 
events  per  100  patient-years.  Related  TEAE  were  noted  for  43.0  %  of  the  patients  with  a  rate  of  46.3. 
Additionally, 29.6 % of the patients experienced serious TEAE (16.0 per 100 p-y), and 3.5% a related TEAE 
(1.2 per 100 p-y).
In  cohort  1  (1  mg/kg  dose  EOW;  naïve  and  switcher  patients),  the  most  commonly  reported  PTs  were 
nasopharyngitis,  followed  by  headache,  fatigue,  back  pain,  diarrhoea,  cough,  and  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection, all reported in >15% of patients. 
Regarding related TEAE, the PTs reported with the higher rate (in events per 100 patient-years) were Fatigue 
(3.1), Nausea (2.4), Infusion related reaction (2.4), Dizziness (1.7), Vomiting (1.4) and Hypersensitivity (1.4). 
Related TEAE were more reported in naïve patients (81.8 per 100 patient-years) than for the switcher patients 
(33.0). This suggests that the safety profile might be different in naïve of any other ERT treatments and non-
naïve patients; and could be explained by first exposition to an ERT. However, data are too limited to conclude 
on difference between these 2 populations. 
Regarding the high dose (2 mg/kg E4W; cohort 2), while the proportion of patients who experienced a related 
TEAE is slightly lower than for the low dose (36.7% vs 42.3%), the rate is rather higher with 49.7 events per 
100 p-y comparing to 39.2. A substantial difference in disfavour of the high dose can be specifically observed 
for IRRs (16.7% of patients with a rate of 21.6 events/100 patients-year vs. 5.4% of patients with a rate of 
2.7) and for pain (13.3% of patients with a rate of 18.4 vs. 4.5% of patients with 2.0). It is noted that difference 
in number of patients in each cohort (i.e. 1 and 2), with a limited number in the cohort 2, make it difficult to 
draw firm conclusion on the safety of the higher dose. However, at this stage, a dose-dependent effect cannot 
be fully excluded regarding the occurrence of IRR.
Regarding  SAE,  overall,  the  main  represented  SOC  were  infections  and  infestations  (2  AE  of  pneumonia), 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (2  AE  of  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease),  cardiac 
disorders, and injury poisoning and procedural complications. In cohort 1, among the SAE reported, 4 were 
assessed as related to the study drug (3.8 of the patients, 1.8 events per 100 p-year). No related SAE occurred 
in the cohort 2, however, the low extent of the exposure in this subset could be a limitation to observed events, 
in particular if not frequent.
In the main the Phase 3 study (PB-102-F20), the proportion of patients experiencing TEAE was overall similar 
across the treatments groups with 88.5% in the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and 96.0% in the Fabrazyme arm. 
However,  the  CHMP  noted  that    the  proportion  of  male  was  higher  in  the  Fabrazyme  arm  than  in  the 
pegunigalsidase alfa arm (72.0% vs. 55.8%) at baseline. 
Considering  a  difference  in  severity  of  the  disease  across  gender  (homozygote  vs.  heterozygote),  a  poorer 
safety  profile  can  be  expected  for  males.  Thus,  the  imbalance  introduces  a  bias  in  the  interpretation  of  the 
data.  It  can  also  be  observed  that  at  baseline,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  of  the  Fabrazyme  arm  was 
receiving premedication for use of Fabrazyme before enrolment, comparing to the pegunigalsidase alfa arm.

Page 155/170
Therefore, this could also introduce a bias comparing safety profiles. However, based on the presented data by 
gender  and  status  of  pre-medication  at  baseline,  no  unexpected  concern  emerges.  Nonetheless,  through 
stratification, the number of patients, and thus of events, per strata is quite reduced limiting the interpretation. 
Due  to  these  imbalances  together  with  the  low  number  of  subjects  enrolled,  and  consequently  the  limited 
number of events occurring during the trial, it appears difficult to well characterize the differences in safety 
profile of pegunigalsidase alfa comparing to another ERT therapy. 
Three  (3)  death  events  have  been  reported  under  pegunigalsidase  alfa  treatments,  but  not  related  to  the 
treatment according to the Applicant. 
IRR/hypersensitivity and Immunological Events
At initial submission, 4 serious Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) related to hypersensitivity, were reported as 
SAE in Cohort 1, with a rate of 1.8 events per 100 p-year: 1 case of severe Bronchospasm (IgE mediated 
hypersensitivity reaction) and 3 cases of hypersensitivity (among them 2 are labelled as Type 1), which all 
occurred during the first infusion of study treatment. All the patients recovered and were discontinued from 
study. Additionally, all 4 serious cases of hypersensitivity reactions were reported in males and probably Ig-E 
mediated, occurred in the two hours (i.e. immediate). suggesting no delayed hypersensitivity reaction 
However, further data are awaited to further characterise these reactions.
Hypersensitivity Reactions (infusion related) is an important identified risk in the RMP to be further monitored 
through pharmacovigilance activities.
During the procedure, a fifth SAE was reported in Cohort 1 and relates to a case of Chills assessed as possibly 
related to Elfabrio and reported in a patient having received Fabrazyme in Study PB-102-F20 after 6 months 
of  treatment  with  pegunigalsidase  alfa  in  Study  PB-102-F60.  The  event  resolved,  and  the  patient  was  re-
administrated as planned, with premedication, and without experiencing further IRR.
IRRs (any severity) occurred respectively in 30.0% (21/70) and 25% (6/24) of males in cohorts 1 and 2 
compared to 12.2% (5/41) and 0% (0/6) in females. This is nevertheless consistent with the difference in 
disease’s severity across gender due to the hemizygosity and heterozygosity.
The IRR rate in naïve subset is 1.5 events per 100 p-year (cohort 5) compared to 0.6 events per 100 p-year 
in non-naïve (cohort 4). But, the low number of naive subjects (n=17) makes difficult the interpretation of 
this difference. 
IRRs were also more frequent in patients with positive or induced ADA status. In cohort 1, 37.0% (10/27) of 
the patients with positive ADA and 35.3% (6/17) of the patients with induced ADA experienced IRRs while 
the proportion was 12.7% (8/63) in patients with negative ADA. Moreover, serious IRR occurred only in 
positive or induced ADA patients.
As reported earlier, a higher rate of IRR has been observed with the 2 mg/kg dose E4W. Additionally, while 
almost all IRR occurred during the Year 1 in cohort 1 (1 mg/kg dose) (5 cases in Year 2 with a rate of 0.2 per 
100 infusions; 3 cases in Year 3 with a rate of 0.1 per 100 infusions), there is a substantial number of events 
reported during the Year 2 (8 cases with a rate of 2.0) and 3 (3 cases with a rate of 0.6) in the cohort 2 (2 
mg/kg dose). This might also suggest that the decrease of hypersensitivity after long term exposure, is less 
reported with the higher dose compared to the low dose.
Data from the main study PB-102-F20 indicated that immunogenicity differences are observed between 
classical and non-classical patients, potentially related to the genotype. Results suggest that the proportion of 
Assessment report

Page 156/170
patients with classic phenotype experiencing IRRs may be higher than for patients with non-classic 
phenotype. 
All patients enrolled in the clinical programme were tested for ADA at baseline and are/were retested every 6 
months. Pre-existing and induced anti- pegunigalsidase alfa antibodies were observed. At baseline, 26.6 % of 
the patients of Cohort 4 (1 mg/kg dose EOW; switcher patients) and 33.3 % of the patients of the Cohort 2 (2 
mg/kg dose E4W; switcher patients) were tested positive for IgG. Among them 96.0% and 100% respectively 
of  these  patients  presented  neutralising  ADA.  The  CHMP  also  noted  that  16.7%  of  the  patients  in  naïve 
population  had  positive  ADA  status  at  baseline,  suggesting  that  the  high  proportion  observed  in  switcher 
patients might result from cross-reactivity. 
Therefore, although data remain too limited to conclude a cross-reactivity between pegunigalsidase alfa and ADA 
anti-Fabrazyme, it cannot be excluded. Further investigation on cross reactivity and potential safety concern of 
induced hypersensitivity reactions in patients starting a treatment with pegunigalsidase alfa due to the presence 
of  ADA  previously  developed  against  other  authorised  ERTs  of  the  same  indication  should  be  followed  up 
through routine pharmacovigilance activities. Warnings related to IRRs and hypersensitivity have been added 
into section 4.4 of the SmPC. Specifically, patients who have experienced severe hypersensitivity reactions with 
ERT infusion are identified as those in need of appropriate and readily available medical support.
Although the current data did not suggest a correlation between antibody titer and occurrence of the IRR, no 
firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  frequency,  severity  and  seriousness  can  be  drawn  due  to  the  very  limited 
number  of  cases.  Altogether  with  the  presented  data  on  biomarkers  of  Fabry  disease  for  the  different  ADA-
subgroups, the CHMP did not support the applicant claim regarding a possible advantage of pegunigalsidase 
alfa on the drug immunogenicity and safety profile as compared to algasidase beta.
Regarding the development of anti-pegunigalsidase alfa antibodies, in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, the proportion 
of  patients  treated  with  the  1  mg/kg  dose  EOW  and  titered  with  ADA  is  increased  at  Month  6  compared  to 
baseline,  and  then  decrease  over  the  time.  In  contrast,  another  pattern  for  the  patients  treated  with  the  2 
mg/kg dose E4W was observed. Regarding the every 6 months titration, the proportion of patients with ADA 
remains stable over the time. These findings are consistent with the fact that more frequent IRR were observed 
after the first year of treatment in the high dose. Although the extent of the exposure to the high dose remains 
limited, the presented data did not suggest a higher risk of onset of induce ADA with the 2 mg/kg E4W dose 
(none observed).
Furthermore, the proportion of patients with neutralising ADA among those who have ADA is rather high (overall 
90% or more) suggesting a potential decrease of the efficacy, including in function of the titers. This should be 
further monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities.
Finally,  some  patients  have  developed  IgG  anti-PEG.  Four  cases  of  serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  were 
reported and likely IgE mediated (with pre-existing IgE antibodies). Since only 8 patients had pre- and post-
dosing anti-drug IgE, further investigation on the relationship between IgE titer and severe hypersensitivity 
reactions could not be made and this should also be followed up through routine pharmacovigilance activities.
Of  interest,  the  applicant  indicated  that  most  often  IRRs  occurred  in  patients  who  had  already  received 
premedication at baseline (i.e. subjects treated with ERT therapy before inclusion could be included in studies 
irrespective  whether  they  had  received  premedication  for  this  previous  ERT).  This  can  be  understood 
considering that patients presenting hypersensitivity reactions to previous ERT (Fabrazyme or Replagal) may 
be more at risk to develop hypersensitivity reaction to pegunigalsidase alfa (see comments on cross-reactivity).
Renal events

Page 157/170
A case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis led to treatment interruption and was not resolved at the 
time  of  the  reporting.  The  Applicant  indicated  that  a  kidney  biopsy  had  been  performed  which  confirmed 
immune complex mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with subendothelial IgG deposits as well 
as lambda and kappa immunoglobulin deposits. The fact that immune complex deposit on kidney could lead to 
irreversible damages of the organs and impairment of the renal function is of concern, especially since renal 
impairment is one the main complications of the Fabry’s disease. Additionally, the risk of local inflammatory 
reactions due to immune complex deposit on other organs/tissues than kidney cannot be fully ruled out. Thus 
in addition to the inclusion of glomerulonephritis membranoproliferative, chronic kidney disease and proteinuria 
as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in section 4.8 of SmPC, a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC was added 
regarding to reflect that  depositions of immune complexes can potentially occur during treatment with ERTs, 
as a manifestation of immunological response to the product.
Other renal events reported was an acute kidney injury AE in the main study. which was considered serious, 
and severe, but  unlikely to be related to study product, according to the applicant. 
Infusion at home
Home infusion was allowed in all studies based on Investigator and the Medical Monitor’ judgement. In total, 
almost 65% (93/142) of all patients received at least an infusion at home. In the cohort 1, it can be observed 
an individual mean number of 48.3 infusion, which is higher to administration on site (i.e. 36.9). Overall, the 
extent of the exposure at home seems sufficient to support the claim in the SmPC.
Additionally, among cases of IRR including hypersensitivity ones, all the 4 related SAE occurred during the 
first administration and soon after the start of the infusion (leading to immediately interrupt the treatment). 
Thus, no related SAE, therefore requiring prompt medical care, were observed after the first administration, 
and/or later in the day or week after the start of the injection. Additionally, at this stage, there is no evidence 
hypersensitivity reaction occurring in longer term treatment. However, data remains limited to draw strong 
conclusion Thus, the CHMP agreed to reflect the use of home administration in the SmPC, provided that 
educational materials are put in place. The important potential risk of medication error in home infusion 
setting will be carefully followed up through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Due  to  the  nature  of  the  product,  it  is  not  expected  that  drug  abuse,  withdrawal  and  rebound  are  likely  to 
occur, no information is available on these aspects this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. However, vertigo 
has been reported as common adverse reaction and thus information on influence on the ability to drive and 
to use machines has been reflected appropriately in the SmPC.
No safety analysis by renal impairment or hepatic impairment were performed, and no data in patients with 
severe renal or severe hepatic impairment are available. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC. 
Appropriate measures including risk minimisation activities (see 2.7) have been put in place to ensure safe 
and effective use of the product in the recommended indication.

2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the the European Birth Date

2.9.  Product information
2.9.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Elfabrio (pegunigalsidase alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as as it is a biological product, which will be authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Pegunigalsidase alfa is intended for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in adult patients with a confirmed 
diagnosis  of  Fabry  disease,  an  X-linked  lysosomal  storage  disorder  caused  by  alterations  in  the  gene  that 
encodes  the  enzyme  α-GAL-A  (GLA)  leading  to  deficient/absent  enzymatic  activity  and  resulting  in 
glycosphingolipid accumulation with life-threatening complications.
Fabry disease is characterised by mutations in the GLA gene, resulting in decreased/undetectable levels of α-
Gal-A activity in plasma or leukocytes, typically observed together with high concentrations of the substrate 
Gb3 and its degradation product, Lyso-Gb3 in tissues and plasma, which both correlate with organ damage.  
Progressive accumulation of Gb3, Lyso-Gb3, and related lipids, leads to impaired tissue and organ function, 
particularly  in  the  kidney,  heart,  and  cerebrovascular  system.  In  addition,  involvement  of  the  central, 
peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems results in episodes of pain and impaired peripheral sensation.

Page 160/170
Fabry disease is categorised in a classic and non-classic form, based on age of symptoms onset and extent of 
organ involvement. Clinical onset of the classic form of disease typically occurs during childhood or adolescence 
and progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiac complications, and/or cerebrovascular disease in 
the  fourth  or  fifth  decade  of  the  life.  Non-classical  Fabry  disease,  also  referred  to  as  late-onset  or  atypical 
disease,  is  characterized  by  a  more  variable  disease  course,  in  which  patients  are  generally  less  severely 
affected and disease manifestations may be limited to a single organ.
Due to the X-linked nature of the disease, males are hemizygotes and females are heterozygotes and affected 
by the mosaicism effect. 
Primary  clinical  manifestations  of  Fabry  Disease  in  males  are:  neuropathic  pain  and  acroparaesthesia; 
angiokeratomas; hypohidrosis; cornea verticillata; hearing loss and gastrointestinal symptoms. Renal disease 
is associated with progressive proteinuria accompanied by a decline in eGFR, leading over a number of years 
to  ESRD  requiring  dialysis  and/or  kidney  transplantation.  Cardiac  disease  is  associated  with  progressive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with diastolic dysfunction, a variety of conduction defects and arrhythmias. Other 
complications are valvular disease and coronary artery stenosis of large or, more commonly, of small vessels.  
It has been estimated that patients with Fabry disease have a 20-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke and 
transient ischemic attacks compared to the general population. Both small and large vessel strokes occur, with 
brain regions perfused by the posterior circulation being affected more commonly than anterior circulation.
Females may express a range of clinical features including life-threatening manifestations such as 
cardiomyopathy, renal disease and stroke. There is considerable variation in the phenotype in heterozygous 
females. Age has the strongest correlation with the presence of symptoms, with the proportion of women 
suffering, from a particular symptom manifesting approximately a decade after that symptom is found in 
males.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
There are currently two approved classes of therapies available for patients with Fabry disease, ERT (Fabrazyme 
and Replagal) and pharmacological chaperone (Galafold). 
Fabrazyme  (agalsidase  beta  1.0  mg/kg  EOW)  and  Replagal  (agalsidase  alfa  0.2  mg/kg  EOW)  are  ERTs 
authorised in the EU and administered by IV infusion. ERT is the longest and most successfully employed drug 
treatment for lysosomal storage disorders indicated across the entire spectrum of disease-causing mutations.  
Both enzymes have shown effects in clinical studies with regard to the preservation of renal function [Hughes 
2017; Vedder 2007; Banikazemi 2007; Eng 2001; Ortiz 2021; Wanner 2020; Germain 2007; Germain 2010; 
Germain 2016; Mehta 2010; Wilcox 2004; Schiffmann 2006; Schiffmann 2009]. In addition, some improvement 
in  clearance  of  Gb3  from  kidney  cells  (such  as  capillary  endothelial  cells,  glomerular  endothelial  cells, 
noncapillary  endothelial  cells  and  noncapillary  smooth  muscle  cells),  and  capillary  endothelial  cells  of  the 
myocardium  and  skin  plasma  [Eng  2001;  Germain  2007;  Schaefer  2009]  as  well  as  quality  of  life  (QoL), 
reduction or stabilisation of cardiac mass can also be observed. 
However,  despite  the  beneficial  effects  described  above,  Fabry  disease  patients  generally  show  only  limited 
clinical improvement on the current ERTs. 
Galafold (migalastat) is the only approved molecular chaperone and is only effective for a subgroup of ~30% 
of Fabry disease patients with amenable mutations. Galafold is approved in the United States, European Union 
and other countries based on reduction of renal Gb3 inclusions.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
Studies PB-102-F01/02/03
The selected 1.0 mg/kg EOW dose was based on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics/biomarker, efficacy, 
and  safety  data  from  studies  PB-102-F01/  PB-102-F02  /PB-102-F03  which  included  Fabry  disease  patients 
either  ERT-naïve  or  to  having  received  ERT  within  the  last  6  months  (n=16).  Pharmacodynamic  endpoints 
included plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) concentration and renal Gb3 inclusion bodies at month 6.
Study PB-102-F20
This main phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind study compared pegunigalsidase alfa 1 mg/kg EOW 
(n=52) to agalsidase beta (n=25) in adult patients with Fabry disease and impaired renal function, who were 
previously treated with agalsidase beta for at least one year. The study comprised a double-blind period (24 
months) followed by an uncontrolled extension study. The primary objective of this study was to determine the 
effect of pegunigalsidase alfa on renal function as measured by annualised eGFR slope at month 12 (interim 
analysis), as compared to agalsidase beta.
The  primary  statistical  objective  of  the  interim  analysis  (month  12)  was  to  test  the  non-inferiority  (NI)  of 
pegunigalsidase  alfa  versus  agalsidase  beta  at  the  5%  level  of  significance  in  the  ITT  population.  The 
predetermined non-inferiority margin was -3 mL/min/1.73 m²/year.
Secondary objectives were to determine safety and effect of pegunigalsidase alfa on kidney function (eGFR as 
determined  by  serum  creatinine,  urine  protein  to  creatinine  ratio  (UPCR))  cardiac  morphology  and  function 
(MRI, stress test, electrocardiogram), biomarkers of Fabry disease (plasma lyso-Gb3 concentration, urine lyso-
Gb3 concentration, plasma Gb3 concentration), severity of Fabry disease (Mainz Severity score index (MSSI)), 
pain  (short  form  Brief  Pain  Inventory  (BPI),  use  of  pain  medication),  overall  well-being  (Quality  of  life 
questionnaire  (EQ-5D-5L)),  incidence  of  Fabry  clinical  events  (serious  renal  event,  cardiac  event, 
cerebrovascular event, and non-cardiac-related death), achievement of Kidney Disease therapeutic goals.
The originally planned primary analysis in the final 2-year data set was a test for superiority over Fabrazyme 
to support submission of another regulatory authority. This analysis is a secondary objective of the main trial 
in the EU submission.
During the procedure the final CSR of study PB102-20 was submitted. In this final report, the Applicant 
submitted a report in which the objective of the final (24-month) analysis from superiority to non-inferiority 
and the primary analysis model were changed  (from a random intercept random slope longitudinal mixed 
model comparing adjusted means of eGFR slopes to a quantile regression model comparing medians of eGFR 
slopes). 
Study PB-102-F30
Additional data of efficacy came from a phase III multicenter, open label study in 22 adult patients with Fabry 
disease,  who  were  previously  treated  with  agalsidase  alfa  for  at  least  2  years.  Patients  were  screened  and 
evaluated  over  3  months  while  continuing  on  agalsidase  alfa  and  subsequently  switched  to  receive 
pegunigalsidase alfa 1 mg/kg EOW over 12-months. The primary objective of this study was the assessment 
of safety and tolerability of pegunigalsidase alfa. The secondary objectives were: mean annualized change in 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR, plasma and urine Lyso-Gb3 and plasma Gb3 concentrations, 
left ventricular mass index (LVMI), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), frequency of pain medication use, 
exercise tolerance, short form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), Fabry Clinical 
Events, and quality of life (EQ-5D-5L).

Study PB102-F50 (alternative dosing regimen)
Data on an alternative dosing regimen of 2.0 mg/kg/Q4W came from a single phase III multicenter, open label 
study  in  29  adult  patients  with  Fabry  disease,  who  were  previously  treated  with  ERT  (agalsidase  alfa  or 
agalsidase beta) for at least 3 years. Patients received pegunigalsidase alfa 2.0 mg/kg E4W over a 12-month 
period.  The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  the  assessment  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  this  dosing  of 
pegunigalsidase  alfa.  The  secondary  objectives  were:  mean  annualized  change  in  estimated  glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR, plasma and urine Lyso-Gb3 and plasma Gb3 concentrations, left ventricular mass 
index (LVMI), urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR), frequency of pain medication use, exercise tolerance, 
short form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI), Fabry Clinical Events, and quality of 
life (EQ-5D-5L).
3.2.  Favourable effects
A pharmacodynamic effect of pegunigalsidase alfa was observed:

in ERT naïve patients (PB 102-F01/02): 
-
after 6 months of treatment, a decrease in renal Gb3 inclusion bodies was observed: 11 out of 14 
(78.6%) subjects with available biopsies had substantial reduction of (≥50%) in their BLISS score 
compared to baseline and a reduction of ≥20% was achieved by 12 subjects (85.7%);
-
after 12 months of treatment, the majority (56.3%) of subjects had a greater than 50% reduction 
and 12.5% had a greater than 75% reduction in plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels;

in pretreated patients (PB 102-F20/): 
-
after 24 months of treatment, plasma Lyso-Gb3 values stayed stable in the study: mean (SE): +3.3 
nM (1.38). 
Clinical data of pegunigalsidase alfa on the renal function showed:
-
in the main study (PB 102-F20 - switch from agalsidase beta) a trend of improvement in both arms 
compared to -8.03 mL/min/1.73 m²/year before the switch in the ITT population:
o
o
at month 12, the mean slopes for eGFR were -2.507 mL/min/1.73 m²/year for the 
pegunigalsidase alfa arm and -1.748 for the agalsidase beta arm (difference -0.749 [-3.026, 
1.507];
at month 24, the median slopes for eGFR were - 2.514 [-3.788; - 1.240] mL/min/1.73 
m²/year for the pegunigalsidase alfa arm and -2.155 [-3.805; - 0.505] for the agalsidase 
beta arm (difference -0.359 [-2.444 ; 1.726]);
-
in a single-arm supportive study (P 102-F30 - switch from agalsidase alfa), patients tended to 
deteriorate less rapidly when exposed to pegunigalsidase alfa compared to their previous treatment: 
the mean (SE) eGFR slope of -1.19 (1.77) mL/min/1.73 m²/year at month 12 compared to -5.90 
(1.34) mL/min/1.73 m²/year before switch;
- moreover, an integrated analysis of the eGFR slope (-2.80 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) up to 7.6 years of 
all available studies showed that the long-term effect of pegunigalsidase alfa seems to be maintained.
In  further  additional  analyses,  most  patients  maintained  normal  or  near  normal  Left  ventricular  mass  index 
(LVMI)  values  throughout  the  studies.  Mean  changes  were  small  and  did  not  suggest  deterioration  of  LVMI

values  over  treatment.  The  severity  of  Fabry  disease  signs  and  symptoms  according  to  the  Mainz  Severity 
Score Index (MSSI) and average pain severity remained stable.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The sample size of the main study is limited (n=77). This is however expected for such a rare disease.
The main study PB-102-F20 could not be sufficiently informative on the primary endpoint/timepoint (alone), 
therefore other timepoints and endpoints of relevance have been considered. Since non-inferiority could not 
be demonstrated for the primary endpoint, all subsequently planned statistical tests for the secondary 
endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could not be carried out under adequate control of the experiment-
wise type-1-error. Thus, from a methodological/statistical point of view, this study cannot provide 
confirmatory evidence of efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa and moreover the data do not allow to clearly 
quantify the effect of pegunigalsidase alfa.
The design of this study was considered inadequate to test the non-inferiority (NI) of Elfabrio vs. its 
comparator. The prespecified NI margin (- 3 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) was based on the absolute effect of the 
comparator in one experience instead of retaining a modicum of its effect in comparison to no treatment and 
was not consistent with the expected difference in favour of pegunigalsidase (+ 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m²/year). 
This NI margin would imply that a loss of efficacy of pegunigalsidase alfa over the control treatment three 
times the expected gain of efficacy is negligible.
Furthermore the intra-patient comparisons are fraught with uncertainty due to likely regression to the mean 
therefore the comparison of pre- baseline and post- baseline eGFR slopes may be biased. Indeed, the 
reliability of the data used to evaluate the pre-baseline slopes eGFR is debatable as historical data were 
obtained at screening through standard local laboratory procedures, whereas creatinine values within the 
study were obtained using an enzymatic assay performed at a central laboratory.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
In total, 111 participants (70 males and 41 females) have been exposed to pegunigalsidase alfa (PRX-102) 1 
mg/kg dose administrated every other week (EOW), of whom 83 patients were treated for at least 20 months 
(among them 59 for at least 30 months). Overall, the extent of the exposure is 293.3 patient-years.
TEAEs were reported in 93.7% of the subjects with a rate of 486.2 events per 100 patient-years. Related TEAEs 
were noted for 42.3 % of the patients with a rate of 39.6 patient-years. Additionally, 34.2 % of the patients 
experienced serious TEAE (19.4 per 100 patient-years), and 4.5% a related TEAE (1.7 per 100 patient-years).
The key safety point is the Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs), which are more frequent in patients with positive 
or induced ADA status. In the population treated with PRX-102 at the 1 mg/kg dose EOW, 37.0% (10/27) of 
the patients with positive ADA and 35.3% (6/17) of the patients with induced ADA experienced IRRs while the 
proportion was 12.7% (8/63) in patients with negative ADA. These adverse events seem overall manageable, 
in particular with premedication. It is noted that a substantial proportion of patients presented with positive 
ADA status for PRX-102 already at baseline (25.6% in patients treated with the 1 mg/kg EOW).
Among IRRs, 4 related SAEs were reported in subject treat with the 1 mg/kg dose EOW, with a rate of 1.4 
events  per  100  patients-year.  Those  were  considered  as  IgE  mediated  hypersensitivity  reactions:  1  case  of 
severe  bronchospasm  and  3  cases  of  hypersensitivity,  which  all  occurred  during  the  first  infusion  of  study 
treatment and in the two hours after start of the administration (i.e. immediate). The 4 patients recovered and 
were discontinued from the study.

Additionally, a related renal severe AE has been reported: a case of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 
with subendothelial IgG deposits as well as lambda and kappa immunoglobulin deposits. This AE, leading to 
treatment interruption, was not resolved at the time of the report.
It is also noted that the proportion of patients with neutralising ADA among those who have ADA was rather 
high (overall 90% or more).
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
There are uncertainties in treatment-naive patients. Although the number of treatment-naïve subjects enrolled 
in the clinical program is limited, results suggest that the safety profile in IRRs might be different, with notably 
a higher adjusted rate of related TEAE observed in this subset compared to ERT experienced patients.
A substantial proportion of patients had positive ADA status at baseline. Considering that cross-reactivity with 
other ERTs is likely, there is a concern that IRRs/hypersensitivity reactions may also occur with pegunigalsidase 
alfa.
Regarding  the  risk  of  membranoproliferative  glomerulonephritis,  irreversible  loss  cannot  be  excluded. 
Additionally,  this  raises  concerns  regarding  the  potential  risk  of  other  local  inflammatory  reactions  due  to 
immune complex deposits on other organs/tissues than kidney, although not observed in the clinical program.
Regarding the comparative data from the study PB-102-F20 conducted versus Fabrazyme, due to the small 
size of the population included in study PB-102-F20, the number of TEAEs and related TEAE is low (most of the 
time, each related TEAE is experienced by one patient only). Thus, conclusions from the comparison of the two 
safety  profiles  is  limited.  Additionally,  several  imbalances  at  baseline,  including  in  gender  and  history  of 
premedication, make interpretation of the data difficult. In particular, although the current data did not suggest 
a correlation between antibody titer and occurrence of the IRR, no firm conclusion on frequency, severity and 
seriousness  can  be  drawn  due  to  the  very  limited  number  of  cases.  Altogether  with  the  presented  data  on 
biomarkers  of  Fabry  disease  for  the  different  ADA-subgroups,  no  claim  regarding  a  possible  advantage  of 
pegunigalsidase  alfa  on  the  drug  immunogenicity  and  safety  profile  as  compared  to  algasidase  beta  can  be 
made.
Finally, considering that the proportion of patients with neutralising ADA among those who have ADA is rather 
high (overall 90% or more), questions remain regarding on how this would impact efficacy in this population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
It should be emphasized that pegunigalsidase alfa is a pegylated form of a human α-galactosidase-A, whose 
amino  acid  sequence  is  similar  to  the  naturally  occurring  human  enzyme,  and  that  the  efficacy  of  enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) with human α-galactosidase is demonstrated for the treatment of Fabry disease. 
Relevant pharmacodynamic evaluations showed that pegunigalsidase alfa has a beneficial effect by decreasing 
both renal Gb3 inclusion bodies and plasma Lyso-Gb3 levels, which is not anticipated without effective ERT. 
No final conclusion on non inferiority over agalsidase beta as measured by the annualised eGFR slope can be 
retrieved from the main study given that the data for the primary endpoint comparison at month 12 was not 
on its own sufficiently informative due to the design and size of the trial. Nevertheless, the median eGFR slopes 
from  baseline  to  month  24  of  pegunigalsidase  and  the  agalsidase  beta  appeared  close:  -  2.51  versus  -2.15 
mL/min/1.73 m²/year, respectively.
Of note, the non-inferiority (NI) margin chosen to demonstrate the non-inferiority of pegunigalsidase alfa over 
agalsidase beta was inadequate as the prespecified margin was based on the absolute change of the comparator 
in one experience, instead of a minimum of its effect in comparison to no treatment. Moreover, comparisons 
of the eGRF slopes before and after study initiation may have been biased or impacted by different methods 
and timing of assessments, regression to the mean, or natural variability in the disease course. Finally, it should 
be noted that a stringent NI for eGFR would have been prohibitive in terms of sample size given the rarity of 
the disease and the small effect size that has actually been observed during the limited observation period in 
this slowly progressing disease. 
Overall, the safety profile of pegunigalsidase alfa 1 mg/kg EOW is reasonably characterized and no unexpected 
safety  concerns  were  observed  in  the  intended  population.  The  key  safety  point  is  the  Infusion  Related 
Reactions,  which  are  importantly  impacted  by  the  ADAs’  status.  However,  based  on  the  current  data,  IRRs 
seem overall manageable, in particular with premedication. Nonetheless, 4 serious cases of hypersensitivity 
were reported, which all occurred during the first infusion of study treatment and soon after the start of the 
administration. Although the current data did not suggest a correlation between antibody titer and occurrence 
of the IRR, no firm conclusion can be drawn due to the very limited number of cases and their severity and 
seriousness in nature. Altogether with the presented data on biomarkers of Fabry disease for the different ADA-
subgroups, no claim regarding a possible advantage of pegunigalsidase alfa on the drug immunogenicity and 
safety profile as compared to agalsidase beta can be made.
Additionally,  a  membranoproliferative  glomerulonephritis  due  to  immune  complex  deposits  was  observed, 
which  could  potentially  impact  the  decline  in  renal  function.  This  will  be  monitored  through  routine 
pharmacovigilance  activities.  Finally,  uncertainties  remain  regarding  naive  patients,  notably  due  to  the  very 
few subjects exposed.
Home infusion was allowed in all studies based on Investigator and the Medical Monitor judgement. In total, 
almost 65% (93/142) of all patients received at least one infusion at home not raising major safety issues. 
Finally,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  neutralising  ADA  among  those  who  have  ADA  is  rather  high  (overall 
90% or more), questioning how this would impact efficacy in usual practice.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
Pegunigalsidase alfa is a pegylated form of human α-galactosidase-A that is intended to supplement biological 
active α-GAL-A enzyme in Fabry disease patients characterised by deficient/absent enzyme activity.
The demonstration of the efficacy is based on the nature of the product (known active substance used as 
enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease), the well-understood mechanism of action, the 
pharmacodynamic effects observed on renal tissue that would not be expected without effective ERT and 
some clinical effect on the renal function. 
The clinical safety profile of pegunigalsidase alfa is overall comparable to that of other authorised ERTs for 
Fabry disease.
Overall, the benefit/risk balance of pegunigalsidase alfa is positive in the claimed indication.
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
The information in this section was received from the patients’ organisations relating to Fabry disease; their 
feedback has been considered during the assessment of this procedure.
Fabry disease is a life-threatening, complex multi-organ disease. In addition to the life-threatening aspects of 
the disease, there are many symptoms that severely affect the patients´ wellbeing and quality of life on a daily 
basis (such as constant pain, GI symptoms or fatigue). There are several ERT treatments available as well as 
an oral medication which, however, is not available for all mutations of the disease. 
Not all patients needing treatment are treated with the current treatment options. In many cases it is because 
the treatments are not suitable or not effective for individual patients. There are dozens of mutations in Fabry 
disease  and  it  is  difficult  to  predict  which  treatment  will  be  effective  for  which  mutation.  This  is  why  it  is 
necessary to develop and search for new therapies that will help these individuals. There are also several unmet 
needs to consider in current Fabry therapies. Obviously there is the case of the Fabry brain because the current 
therapies don´t cross the blood-brain barrier to reach the patient´s brain. A second unmet need to consider 
would be the fatigue that is often combined with depression. The current therapies haven´t solved that issue 
completely. As far as quality of life issues are concerned, a lot of the patients find it burdensome and difficult 
to travel to and from hospitals every 2 weeks, so any solution to that would be more than welcome. 
Female  Fabry  patients  are  often  not  receiving  treatment  because  their  symptoms  are  different  from  the 
symptoms of the male patients. They might experience less "severe" symptoms that make them not qualify for 
the current treatments. Their symptoms do, however, as mentioned before have serious effects on their quality 
of life. Many female Fabry patients experience additional problems during pregnancy and/or menopause that 
should also be taken into consideration in the future. 
The question of acceptable side effects is complex. In patient’s opinion a treatment-naive patient is ready to 
accept more side effects than a patient switching between products. Side effects should never be worse than 
the patient´s own symptoms.
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Elfabrio is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section

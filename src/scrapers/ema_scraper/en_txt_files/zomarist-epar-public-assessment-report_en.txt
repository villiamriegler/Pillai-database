2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Eucreas  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full 
application  under  Art  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended,  has  been  given  allowing  access  to 
Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-
marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for Zomarist consists only of 
Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Zomarist medicinal product are identical to the 
up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Eucreas. Information on the scientific discussions can 
be  found  in  the  Eucreas  CHMP  assessment  report  and  in  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR). 
Vildagliptin  belongs  to  a  new  class  of  oral  anti-diabetic  drugs  and  is  a  selective  and  reversible 
inhibitor  of  dipeptidyl  peptidase  4  (DPP-4),  the  enzyme  which  inactivates  the  incretin  hormones, 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), hormones 
which significantly contribute to the maintenance of glucose homeostasis.  
Metformin  is  an  established  first  line  treatment  for  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  acting  primarily  to 
enhance hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity.  
Vildagliptin and metformin is intended for use in patients with T2DM as fixed combination tablets.  
The approved indication is:  
“Zomarist is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve 
sufficient  glycaemic  control  at  their  maximally  tolerated  dose  of  oral  metformin  alone  or  who  are 
already treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets.” 
The tablets are available in 2 strengths: vildagliptin 50 mg and metformin 850 mg, and vildagliptin 50 
mg and metformin 1000 mg. In all cases, the recommended daily dose is 100 mg vildagliptin, allowing 
a daily dose of 1700 to 2000 mg metformin. 
2.2  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the quality data in support of 
the Zomarist application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Eucreas dossier which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3 
Non-clinical aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Eucreas  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in 
support  of  the  Zomarist  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Eucreas 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.4 
Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the clinical data in support of 
the Zomarist application are identical to the up-to-date clinical data of the Eucreas dossier, which have 
been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP did not require the MAA to submit a risk management plan because the reference product 
Eucreas  does  not  have  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  beyond  providing  guidance  in  the 
prescribing information. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Eucreas application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  Zomarist  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation for the following indication:  
“Zomarist is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who are unable to achieve 
sufficient  glycaemic  control  at  their  maximally  tolerated  dose  of  oral  metformin  alone  or  who  are 
already treated with the combination of vildagliptin and metformin as separate tablets.”

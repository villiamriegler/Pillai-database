Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Sialanar 
(glycopyrronium bromide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Sialanar. The RMP details important 
risks of Sialanar, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Sialanar's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Sialanar's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Sialanar should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Sialanar should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Sialanar's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Sialanar is authorised for the symptomatic treatment of severe sialorrhoea (chronic pathologic 
drooling) (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains glycopyrronium as the active substance 
and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Sialanar’s benefits can be found in Sialanar’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/sialanar. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Sialanar, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Sialanar's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
In the case of Sialanar, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Sialanar is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Sialanar are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Sialanar. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine);

Constipation 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Constipation is a known adverse event associated with 
to the medicine 
cerebral palsy. A cross-sectional observational study was 
performed in specialized day-care centres and schools in 
the Netherlands which included 152 children (81 males, 71 
females; mean age 9y 6mo, SD 4y 6mo), Veugelers, 2010. 
Of the studied population, 57% were constipated and 55% 
used laxatives, 27% of whom showed symptoms of 
constipation. In addition, constipation is a known adverse 
event associated with anticholinergic drugs and was seen in 
the placebo-controlled efficacy study by Zeller, 2012. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
• 
Patients with a history of intestinal obstruction, 
ulcerative colitis, paralytic ileus, and pre-existing 
constipation  
• 
Long term Sialanar use 
•  Off label use in patients with severe renal failure 
• 
Patients receiving concomitant therapy with opioids, 
other anticholinergic agents, and other medicinal 
products with anticholinergic properties such as 
antidepressants and antihistamines.

Urinary retention 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Urinary retention is a recognised side effect of 
to the medicine 
anticholinergic drugs. It is believed to be secondary to their 
inhibitory effect on bladder contraction in the presence of 
outlet obstruction, an effect achieved primarily by 
antagonizing postjunctional excitatory muscarinic receptors 
[M(2)/M(3)] in the detrusor (Cladellas, 2008). Urinary 
retention was also seen at in 15% of participants taking 
glycopyrronium bromide in the placebo-controlled efficacy 
study by Zeller, 2012.

Pneumonia 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Pneumonia is a known adverse event associated with the 
to the medicine 
use of anticholinergic drugs. Children with the most severe 
pharyngeal dysphagia are at medical risk due to saliva 
aspiration to the lungs, which can lead to recurrent 
episodes of pneumonia (Erasmus, 2012).  Pneumonia was 
reported as one of the treatment-emergent adverse events 
in the 24 week safety study conducted by Zeller, 2012b. It 
was one of the TEAEs occurring more frequently in the 
high-dose (<0.2 mg/kg) and middle-dose (>0.1 to <0.2 
mg/kg) than in the low-dose (>0.1 mg/kg) group, 7.9% 
versus 5.7% versus 0%.

Risk of overheating 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Hyperthermia and increased body temperature are known 
to the medicine 
adverse effects of anticholinergic drugs due to inhibition of 
correct sweat gland functions which can produce difficulties 
in temperature regulation, Bavikatte 2019.

Cardiac disorders 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Children with CP frequently have concurrent cardiac 
to the medicine 
abnormalities, higher HR and more ECG abnormalities than 
normal controls, irrespective of treatment with 
glycopyrronium (Rankin, 2010; Garne, 2008; Pastore, 
2011). Glycopyrronium as an anticholinergic, is expected to 
increase the HR (Preiss, 1983).  In a pooled population of 
children with problem drooling associated with neurologic 
conditions, glycopyrrolate oral solution was associated with 
a moderate increase from baseline in mean systolic blood 
pressure (+3.4mmHg), a small decrease in mean diastolic 
blood pressure (-0.3mmHg), and a small (but clinically 
relevant) increase in mean heart rate (+1.9 beats/min; 
+10.5 beats/min in the placebo-controlled study alone. No 
changes in mean respiratory rate or body temperature 
were observed, and the small increase in mean body 
weight (+1.15 kg) may be attributed to normal growth over 
a 6-month study period (Garnock-Jones, 2012).

Important potential risk – Anticholinergic side effects due to dosing errors 
Dental caries 
Evidence for linking the risk 
A consequence of hyposalivation is an increased risk of 
to the medicine 
developing dental caries. Lähteenmäki et al studied the 
effect of i.v. glycopyrronium bromide on oral mucous host 
defences in 12 healthy male subjects (Lähteenmäki, 2000).  
After administration of a single dose of i.v. glycopyrronium 
bromide (4 µg/kg), salivary concentrations of both 
immunological and non-immunological defence factors were 
increased.  However, their secretion per time (output) 
decreased as a result of reduced salivary flow rate in 
comparison with i.v. saline (placebo).  Decreased 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G secretion lasted for at least six 
hours after glycopyrronium bromide administration, but 
there were no differences in the output of IgA or IgM three 
hours after injection compared with placebo.  The authors 
concluded that hyposalivation induced by glycopyrronium 
bromide causes marked and prolonged impairment of the 
secretion of oral host defence factors, which may be 
harmful to patients who have systemic disease or 
conditions related to hyposalivation.  Decreased salivation 
may also increase the risk of developing oral diseases and 
make patients susceptible to mucositis, especially 
candidiasis (Närhi, 1999).  A common consequence of 
reduced salivary flow is an increased risk of dental caries. 
Therefore, where treatment is to be continued for a 
considerable period of time, attention to dental care should 
be encouraged (Arnrup, 1990).

Important potential risk – Anticholinergic side effects due to dosing errors 
CNS effects 
Evidence for linking the risk 
Anticholinergic drugs work by decreasing the volume of 
to the medicine 
saliva secreted from the salivary glands and thus the 
severity of drooling.  Hyoscine (scopolamine) (Lewis, 
1994), benztropine mesylate (Camp-Bruno, 1989) and 
benzhexol (Reddihough, 1990) have all been shown to be 
useful for controlling drooling in children with neurological 
disorders.  However, their lack of selectivity leads to 
widespread, undesirable, and often poorly tolerated central 
and peripheral effects, including restlessness, irritability, 
drowsiness, constipation, urinary retention, and flushing 
(Mier, 2000).  Glycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium 
member of the anticholinergic class of drugs which has also 
been demonstrated to be effective in reducing sialorrhoea.  
As a consequence of its quaternary charge, glycopyrronium 
has limited ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier (Ali-
Melkkilä, 1990b; Rautakorpi, 1996) and so in theory 
centrally mediated adverse effects should be relatively low. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
•  Children with compromised blood brain barrier. 
• 
Long term Sialanar use 
•  Off label use in patients with severe renal failure 
• 
Patients receiving concomitant medication with other 
drugs with CNS effects.

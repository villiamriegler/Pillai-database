The  Rapporteur's  initial  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  members  of  the  previous 
CPMP on 26 July 1994. 
The  French  Co-Rapporteur  prepared  additional  clinical  assessment  on  4  August  1994.  The 
German Co-Rapporteur prepared additional preclinical assessment on 18 August 1994. 
The  consolidated  list  on  chemical/pharmaceutical  issues  was  sent  to  the  company  on 
12 October, and on preclinical and clinical points on 18 October 1994. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 20 January 1995. 
The  Rapporteur  circulated  the  Responses  Assessment  Report  on  preclinical  and  clinical 
responses provided by the company to all CPMP members on 23 February 1995. 
The  Rapporteur  circulated  the  Responses  Assessment  Report  on  pharmaceutical  responses 
provided by the company to all CPMP members on March 1995. 
After  the  Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur  meeting  held  on  7  March  1995,  the  CPMP  in  its  March 
meeting  discussed  the  recommendations  presented  by  the  Rapporteur.  A  revised  SPC  was 
circulated  to  all  CPMP  members.  The  remaining  pharmaceutical  comments  were  sent  to  the 
company on 31 March 1995. 
The  company's  answers  were  considered  by  the  CPMP  ad  hoc  Biotechnology  Working  Party 
during its meeting on 6-7 April 1995. 
A further list of remaining pharmaceutical points to be answered by the company was prepared. 
The  company  responded  to  the  questions  on  18  April  1995.  The  Rapporteur  circulated  the 
Assessment Report on the responses on 21 April 1995. 
The  company requested  a  change  from  trade  name  Beneseron to  Betaferon on 12  April  1995. 
The  CPMP  during  its  meeting  of  26-27  April  1995  agreed  that  all  the  quality  issues  which 
required resolution before granting marketing authorisation had been resolved. A list of further 
pharmaceutical  points  for  clarification  to  be  addressed  in  the  post-authorisation  phase  was 
agreed.

The revised SPC was discussed and the company was asked to present for a hearing at the May 
1995 meeting of the CPMP. It was agreed that the hearing with the company would be focusing 
on issues relating to the immunogenicity of Betaferon. 
The inspection of the manufacturing plant was planned. It was agreed that, provided there was a 
positive outcome of the hearing and of the inspection, further clinical data was to be provided 
by the company after marketing authorisation. 
UK and French inspectors performed inspection of the production facility in the USA on 11-12 
May 1995. The outcome of the inspection was favourable. 
During  the  CPMP  meeting  on  16-17  May  1995,  a  hearing  with  the  company  took  place  to 
address concerns  on the immunogenicity of Betaferon. The CPMP  considered that, in light of 
the new data from the 3rd year extension study provided by the company during the hearing, an 
updated clinical report was to be compiled. 
The CPMP took note of the favourable outcome of the EU inspection of the US manufacturing 
site. 
During the CPMP meeting on 7-8 June, an additional list of questions to be put to the applicant 
was agreed, in order to have further clarification on points related to the new clinical evidence 
provided by the company during the hearing held in May. 
The  Rapporteur  prepared  a  further  Assessment  Report  on  3  July  1995,  considering  that  the 
responses provided by the company were satisfactory. 
Amendments were accordingly made to the texts of the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
During the CPMP meeting on 11-12 July 1995, the clarifications given by the company as well 
as  the  new  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  texts  were  considered 
adequate  in  the  light  of  current  scientific  knowledge,  and  the  CPMP  therefore  unanimously 
decided to issue a positive recommendation for the marketing authorisation of Betaferon. 
On  27  November  1995,  the  European  Commission  issued  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for 
Betaferon  under  exceptional  circumstances.  This  implied  that  pursuant  to  Article  13  (2)  of 
Council  Regulation  (EEC)  No  2309/93  and  Part  4  G  of  the  Annex  to  Council  Directive 
75/318/EEC,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  had  to  provide  final  reports  of  ongoing 
clinical studies as listed in Annex II.C to the Commission Decision. These data would form the 
basis of the re-assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of Betaferon.

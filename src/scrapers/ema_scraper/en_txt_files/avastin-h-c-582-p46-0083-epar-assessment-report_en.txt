1.  Introduction 
On 16 November 2015 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Avastin in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  BO20924  (BERNIE)  is  a  standalone  study.  A  line  listing  of  all  studies 
included in the development program has been provided. 
The Avastin BERNIE study is part of an approved PIP EMEA-000056-PIP01-07-MO2 for the treatment of 
rhabdomyosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma. 
The  first  patient  was  randomized  in  Study  BO20924  on  29  July  2008.  Patient  recruitment  was 
completed  on  31  October  2013,  after  a  total  of  154  patients  had  been  randomized.  The  primary 
analysis  was  EFS,  and  this  CSR  is  based  on  the  clinical  cut  off  of  31  May  2015,  approximately  19 
months  after  the  last  patient  was  randomized.  Following  completion  of  the  analyses  included  in  this 
CSR,  Study  BO20924  is  continuing  and  patients  will  be  followed  for  a  minimum  of  47  months  for 
overall survival (OS) and the long-term effects of treatment. 
The Sponsor will submit a CSR addendum with the final analysis results (EFS and OS) for the BERNIE 
study in 2019. 
The  Avastin  BERNIE  study  failed  to  meet  the  primary  endpoint  and  no  new  safety  signals  have  been 
identified. Therefore, the MAH will not be seeking an indication nor amending existing indications.

Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
Overall Objective 
The objective of Study BO20924 was to evaluate the role of anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab 
as part of the multi-modality treatment of patients presenting with metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and  
non-rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Primary Objective 
To  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  as  compared  to 
chemotherapy alone in children and adolescent patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS as 
assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)-evaluated Event-Free Survival (EFS) 
Secondary Objectives 
To  determine  the  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  as 
compared to chemotherapy alone in patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS, as assessed 
by: 
. Adverse event profile 
. Discontinuation or modification or delay of any treatment element 
. Objective response rate (according to RECIST v1.0) prior to local therapy 
. Overall survival (OS) 
. Duration of response (DoR)

To  characterize  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  bevacizumab  across  all  age  subsets  of  the  study 
population 
Exploratory Objective 
Correlation of biomarker assessments with risk factors and treatment outcome 
Study design 
A  randomized,  comparative,  open-label,  multi-center  Phase  II  study  evaluating  the  benefit  of  the 
addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  in  children  and  adolescent  patients  presenting  with 
metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma. Patients who fulfilled 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the screening assessments were randomized 1:1 to 
receive combined modality therapy with or without bevacizumab. 
Study population 
150  patients  between  6  months  and  18  years  of  age  with  a  histologically  established  diagnosis  of 
metastatic  or  unresectable  soft  tissue  sarcoma  (STS),  either  rhabdomyosarcoma  (RMS)  or  non-
rhabdomyosarcoma 
Sample size 
STS 150 patients planned. 154 patients enrolled; (74 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm and 80 patients 
in the Chemo arm). 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to the experimental arm received bevacizumab every three weeks at a dose of 2.5 
mg/kg/week  in  addition  to  chemotherapy  (IVADo)  and  local  therapy  (radiation  and/or  surgery)  as 
appropriate  during  the  induction  phase.  Bevacizumab  dosing  was  maintained  at  the  same  dose 
intensity during the maintenance phase with cyclophosphamide and vinorelbine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
Primary Endpoints 
The primary endpoint of Study BO20924 was EFS, defined as the time between randomization and any 
of the following: 
• Disease progression (as evaluated by a central independent image review committee), or 
• Recurrence (as evaluated by a central independent image review committee) 
• No documented evidence of response after three cycles of induction chemotherapy (as derived from 
central independent image review committee visit response data) 
• Second primary cancer 
• Death due to any cause 
Secondary Endpoints 
• Overall response (OR) prior to local therapy, defined as complete response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart 
• Overall survival, defined as the time between randomization and death due to any cause

• Duration of Response, defined as time between the first tumor assessment that supported patient’s 
OR and the occurrence of an event contributing to primary EFS. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Exploratory endpoint 
Analyses of biomarkers (for available patients), including: 
• Correlation of baseline placental growth factor (PlGF) 
• Correlation of tumor VEGFA with EFS, OS, and risk factors 
• Analyses changes of PlGF over time 
• Correlation of PlGF with risk factors 
Pharmacokinetics 
Secondary endpoint 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  bevacizumab  for  PK-evaluable  paediatric  patients  in  Study  BO20924, 
using a paediatric population PK model 
Safety 
Secondary endpoint 
To  determine  the  safety,  tolerability  and  efficacy  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  as 
compared to chemotherapy alone in patients presenting with metastatic RMS and NRSTS, as assessed 
by: 
• Adverse event analyses. 
• Discontinuation or modification or delay of any treatment element 
Clinical assessments included: 
•  Signs  and  symptoms,  weight,  height  (sitting  and  standing),  head  circumference,  and  menstrual 
status. 
• Reporting of adverse events (AEs) as per NCI CTCAE version 3 
•  Standard  laboratory  investigations  including  hematology,  biochemistry,  urinalysis,  and  a  pregnancy 
test when clinically indicated 
• Special investigations (ECG) and echocardiography 
• X-ray of the left hand, including the wrist (as assessment of epiphyseal/metaphyseal development), 
and bone age assessments. 
Statistical Methods 
Primary endpoint 
•  EFS:  data  for  patients  who  had  not  experienced  an  event  by  the  time  of  clinical  cut-off  (31  May 
2015) were censored at the date of the last disease assessment prior to the clinical cut-off date. Data 
for  patients  who  did  not  have  any  post-baseline  disease  assessments  were  censored  at  the  time  of 
randomization.  The  two-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  was  used  to  compare  EFS  between  the  two 
treatment arms.

Secondary endpoints: 
•  Objective  response  rate:  patients  who  had  no  post-baseline  record  of  tumor  assessment  were 
counted  as  non-responders.  Patients  without  measurable  disease  at  baseline  were  excluded  from  the 
analysis.  The  difference  in  objective  response  rate  between  the  treatment  arms  was  tested  in  an 
exploratory manner, using a chi-square test with Schouten correction.  
• Overall survival: data for patients without an event at the time of the clinical cut-off were censored 
at  the  date  they  were  last  known  to  be  alive.  Data  for  patients  who  did  not  have  any  post-baseline 
information  were  censored  at  the  date  of  randomization.  The  statistical  methods  used  for  the  OS 
analysis were the same as those described for the primary endpoint of EFS.  As a sensitivity analysis, 
unstratified analysis of OS was also performed. 
•  Duration  of  response:  as  DoR  was  only  calculated  for  patients  who  had  an  objective  response, 
patients  without  measurable  disease  at  baseline  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  The  censoring 
method  for  DoR  was  the  same  as  that  for  EFS.  The  Kaplan-Meier  approach  was  used  to  estimate 
median  DoR  for  each  treatment  arm.  The  95%  CI  of  the  median  DoR  was  estimated  using  the 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  154  patients  in  the  intent-to-treat  population  (80  patients  in  the 
Chemo arm and 74 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm) unless otherwise specified. 
Baseline data 
Baseline  disease  characteristics  were  balanced  between  the  study  treatment  arms.  In  terms  of 
patients’  surgical  status  at  baseline,  the  primary  tumor  was  intact  in  the  majority  of  patients.  The 
primary tumor was intact in 55/80 patients in the Chemo arm and 53/74 patients in the Bv + Chemo 
arm.  The  most  common  histological  subtype  of  metastatic  RMS  in  the  high-  risk  group  was  alveolar 
RMS (31/40 [77.5%] patients in the Chemo arm and 24/38 patients [63.2%] in the Bv + Chemo arm). 
The most common histological subtype of RMS in the non highrisk group was  embryonal RMS (10/13 
patients [76.9%] in the Chemo arm and 8/12 [66.7%] patients in the Bv + Chemo arm). 
About  one-third  of  patients  had  NRSTS:  26  patients  (32.5%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  23  patients 
(31.1%) in the Bv + Chemo arm. Among patients with NRSTS, the most common histological subtype 
diagnosis was desmoplastic small round cell tumor (7/26 patients [26.9%] in the Chemo arm and 5/23 
patients [21.7%] in the Bv + Chemo arm).

Pharmacokinetic results 
The PK of bevacizumab for the 70 PK-evaluable paediatric patients from the analysis of Study BO20924 
was  well  characterized  by  a  comprehensive  paediatric  PopPK  model  (two-compartment  with  linear 
elimination  and  allometric  scaling)  consisting  of  data  from  152  paediatric  patients  across  4  clinical 
studies. The paediatric PopPK model included data from 39 paediatric patients in Study BO20924 that 
were initially reported in the planned interim Futility Analysis for the study. 
Covariates  associated  with  bevacizumab  PK  in  paediatric  patients  were  similar  to  those  found  with 
adults  with  body  weight  (BW),  sex  (gender),  and  albumin  levels  having  significant  impact  on 
bevacizumab  exposure.  Compared  to  BW,  body-surface  area  (BSA)  was  not  found  to  significantly 
improve  data  fitting  by  the  Paed  PopPK  mode.  Importantly,  age  was  not  found  to  be  associated  with 
bevacizumab  PK  when  BW  was  taken  into  account.  No  other  PK  associated  covariates  were  observed 
for patients in Study BO20924 based on comparisons of key PK parameters  between Ped PopPK final 
model predictions and estimations of observed data. Due to the influence of BW on PK parameters as 
described  in  the  comprehensive  Paed  PopPK  model,  there  was  a  trend  toward  lower  concentrations 
(Cmin and Cmax) and exposure (AUC) as BW decreased. 
Based on observed data from the PK-evaluable paediatric patients in Study BO20924, paediatric PopPK 
predictions of bevacizumab steady-state trough concentrations (Css-min) were generally found to fall 
within  the  90%  prediction  intervals  (90%  PI)  of  adults  when  administered  the  same  dosing  regimen 
(7.5  mg/kg  q3w  [induction  therapy  phase]).  Although  bevacizumab  concentrations  were  generally 
lower in paediatric patients than adults, the Paed PopPK model predicted Css-min to be ~30 mcg/mL 
or  greater,  which  is  similar  to  adults  administered  the  Study  BO20924  dose  regimen.  Bevacizumab 
steady-state peak concentrations (Css-max) and exposure (AUCss) tended to fall below the 90% PI of 
adults as BW decreased. The cause for Cmax and AUC to fall below the 90% PI for adults is unknown 
as there are no adult patients with sarcomas represented in the Adult PopPK model to compare against 
paediatric patients with sarcomas. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
No  statistically  significant  improvement  was  seen  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  over  the  Chemo  arm  with 
respect to the primary endpoint of EFS as assessed by IRC. HR was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value 
= 0.72).

The median EFS was 14.9 months (95% CI 10.8, 35.9) in the Chemo arm and 20.6 months (95% CI 
15.2, 24.9) in the Bv + Chemo arm. KM estimate for event-free survival rate at 12 months was 57.0% 
in  the  Chemo  arm  and  75.2%  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm;  and  at  18  months  was  44.3%  in  the  Chemo 
arm and 54.3% in the Bv +  Chemo arm. The Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves crossed at approximately 24 
months after randomization 
Four sensitivity analyses of EFS were performed to assess the robustness of the primary analysis: 
• 
Investigator-evaluated EFS 
Investigator-evaluated EFS was similar to the IRC-evaluated EFS, and was not significantly different 
between  treatment  arms:  HR  was  0.71  (95%  CI:  0.47,  1.07;  pvalue  =  0.10).  The  Kaplan-Meier 
estimate  of  the  median  EFS  was  12.5  months  (95%  CI:  9.3,  18.6)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  18.9 
months (95% CI: 14.7, 25.4) in the Bv + Chemo arm. 
A concordance analysis was performed on the ITT population. The concordance rates (i.e., for EFS 
events  assessed  with  less  than  14  days  apart  between  investigator  and  IRC  assessment,  or 
agreement  on  the  absence  of  event  assessed  by  either)  were  63.8%  (51/80)  for  patients  in  the 
Chemo arm and 45.9% (34/74) for patients in the Bv + Chemo arm. 
For  14  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  22  patients  in  the  Bv+  Chemo  Arm,  the  EFS  event  as 
assessed  by  IRC  occurred  later  than  the  investigator-assessed  EFS  event.  A  time-sensitive 
radiological  review  committee  was  responsible  for  the  confirmation  of  the  patient’s  status  of 
“treatment  failure,”  after  3  cycles  of  induction  therapy.  This  review  was  performed  in  an  ongoing 
manner at the request of the investigator. 
•  There  were  7  patients  who  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  having  experienced  insufficient 
therapeutic  response.  The  investigator’s  assessment  was  confirmed  by  the  committee  in  5  cases. 
Unstratified EFS

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Avastin 
Page 12/24 
 
 
 
 
Using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model,  the  unstratified  analysis  of  the  IRC-assessed  EFS  gave 
similar results to the stratified analysis: HR was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.48; p-value = 0.94). See 
table13 above 
• 
IRC-evaluated EFS, censoring EFS at initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer treatment  
A sensitivity analysis was performed with data censored at the time patients started a non-protocol 
anti-cancer  therapy  (before  experiencing  an  EFS  event).  This  analysis  was  stratified  by  age  and 
histology/disease risk. The HR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.49, 1.46; p-value = 0.56). This  EFS estimate 
was consistent with the results of the primary analysis. 
• 
IRC-evaluated EFS, censoring EFS at early discontinuation of all study treatment. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed with data censored at the time patients discontinued all study 
treatment early for any reason (before experiencing an EFS event). This analysis was stratified by 
age and histology/disease risk. The HR was 1.19 (95% CI 0.74, 1.93; p-value = 0.48).

Secondary endpoints 
Overall survival 
As  of  the  clinical  cutoff  date,  31  May  2015,  37  patients  (46.3%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  34  patients 
(45.9%) in the Bv + Chemo arm had died. The OS analysis at this stage is not mature as over 50% of 
the patients are still alive. The HR was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by 
age and histology/disease risk. The addition of bevacizumab to standard of care chemotherapy did not 
result  in  a  significant  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  (HR  0.79,  95%  CI  0.49,  1.26;  p-value  =  0.32) 
(Table 18). Similar results were obtained from the unstratified analysis.

Objective Response Rate 
Objective  response  prior  to  first  local  therapy  was  defined  as  a  complete  response  (CR)  or  partial 
response (PR) determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart as assessed by RECIST v1.0. 
For the ORR analysis, patients without measurable disease at baseline were excluded. 
Per  IRC,  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  ORR  was  seen  between  the  two  treatment  arms:  27/75 
patients  (36.0%,  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI:  25.2%,  47.9%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  34/63  patients 
(54.0%,  95%  Clopper-Pearson  CI:  40.9%,  66.6%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  were  assessed  as  having 
had  a  confirmed  response  prior  to  receiving  any  local  therapy  in  Study  BO20924.  The  difference  in 
response rates between arms was 18.0% (95% Hauck-Anderson CI: 0.6%, 35.3%; p-value = 0.04). 
Duration of Response 
Twenty-seven  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  34  patients  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  had  an  objective 
response  and  were  included  in  the  analysis  of  DoR,  defined  as  the  time  from  the  first  tumor 
assessment  that  supported  assessment  of  a  confirmed  overall  response,  until  the  occurrence  of  an 
event contributing to the primary endpoint of EFS. Of the patients included in the DoR analysis, 11/27 
patients  (40.7%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  26/34  patients  (76.5%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  had 
experienced EFS events after their confirmed objective response. The KM curve of DoR in the Chemo 
arm  did  not  cross  50%.  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  DoR  was  17.5  months  (Brookmeyer-
Crowley  95%  CI:  12.3,  25.2)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm.  The  censoring  methods  for  the  DoR  analysis 
were the same as those used for patients in the EFS analysis.

Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed for IRC-assessed EFS using the following factors: sex, age group, 
histology/disease  risk,  status  of  primary  tumor,  primary  tumor  type,  and  presence  of  bone  marrow 
metastases,  Karnofsky 
scale, 
Lansky  Play-Performance  Status,  and  history  of 
local 
surgery/radiotherapy  during  the  study.  The  results  for  these  subgroups  were  consistent  with  the 
results  of  the  primary  analysis  (see  Figure  9)  except  for  patients  with  local  surgery  and  radiotherapy 
and  patients  without  any  local  therapy.  Due  to  small  numbers  of  patients  in  these  subgroups,  no 
conclusion could be drawn.

Subsequent Treatment after Study Treatment Discontinuation 
Drug  Therapies  for  Cancer  Among  the  patients  in  the  ITT  population,  38  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm 
(47.5%)  and  30  patients  (40.5%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  received  subsequent  treatment  for  cancer 
after discontinuation of study treatment in Study BO20924.  
Among  the  patients  in  the  ITT  population,  22  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  (27.5%)  and  18  patients 
(24.3%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  underwent  additional  radiotherapy  after  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment  in  Study  BO20924.  In  the  cases  where  a  site  was  specified,  the  most  common  location  of 
therapy  was  bone  (6  patients  [7.5%]  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  4  patients  [5.4%]  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo 
arm). 
Among  the  patients  in  the  ITT  population,  12  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm  (15.0%)  and  11  patients 
(14.9%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  underwent  a  surgical  procedure  after  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment in Study BO20924. Three patients (3.8%) who had participated in the Chemo arm of Study 
BO20924 underwent an additional surgical procedure: aspiration biopsy, cystoscopy, and ureteroscopy, 
respectively. No additional surgical procedures were reported among patients who had participated in 
the Bv + Chemo arm. 
Eleven  patients  (13.8%)  in  the  Chemo  arm  and  11  patients  (14.9%)  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm 
underwent additional surgeries after discontinuation of study treatment.

Biomarker analyses 
Biomarker analyses were performed on patients from the ITT population who consented to participate 
in the translational research program and for whom samples were available at baseline. A total of 77 
patients (48 in the  Chemo arm and 29 in the Bv  +  Chemo arm) had PlGF measurements at baseline 
and on study (Cycle 5 Day 1) and 52 patients (29 in the Chemo arm and 23 in the Bv + Chemo arm) 
had tumor VEGF-A (tVEGFA) measurements at baseline. 
PIGF analysis 
EFS analysis in the PlGF-evaluable population showed corresponding results to those observed for the 
ITT  population.  An  HR  of  0.83  (95%  CI:  0.43,  1.59)  was  observed  in  the  Chemo  arm  vs.  the  Bv  + 
Chemo arm in the PlGF-evaluable population 
The ITT population results overall showed an HR of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 0.72) (Table 
13). Furthermore, no significant change was seen in the EFS analysis comparing the Chemo arm with 
the Bv + Chemo arm for the baseline high PlGF level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 
0.85;  95%  CI:  0.38,  1.89),  median  (HR=  1.22;  95%  CI:  0.49.  3.06)  and  third  quartile  (HR  =  0.69; 
95% CI: 0.18, 2.71)  
OS analysis in the PlGF-evaluable population also showed similar results to those observed for the ITT 
population:  an  HR  of  0.64  (95%  CI:  0.30,  1.35)  was  observed  in  the  Chemo  arm  versus  the  Bv  + 
Chemo arm in this population (ITT population results: HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.49, 1.26; p-value = 0.32]). 
No  significant  change  was  seen  in  the  OS  analysis  comparing  the  Chemo  arm  with  the  Bv  +  Chemo 
arm for the baseline high PlGF level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 0.64; 95% CI: 
0.26,  1.61),  median(HR  =  0.65;  95%  CI:  0.21,  1.98)  and  third  quartile  (HR  =  0.44;  95%  CI:  0.09, 
2.07). 
In a Cox regression analysis for OS including trial treatment, baseline biomarker level dichotomized at 
quartiles  and  the  interaction  term  of  treatment  by  biomarker  level,  there  was  no  indication  of  a 
treatment by biomarker level interaction. 
Based on the limited data, no predictive value could be concluded for baseline PlGF as a biomarker for 
the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment. Additionally, the correlation was examined between PlGF levels 
and  patient  risk  factors  reported  at  baseline.  A  correlation  was  noted  between  PlGF  levels  and  bone 
marrow metastases at baseline. Among the low PlGF level group, 37/39 patients (94.9%) did not have 
bone  marrow  metastases  vs.  27/38  patients  (71.1%)  in  the  high-PlGF  group  (p  =  0.01).  Another 
correlation was also noted between PlGF levels and histology/disease risk at baseline. Among the high

PlGF  level  group,  27/38  patients  (71.1%)  had  high  risk  metastatic  RMS,  4/38  patients  (10.5%)  had 
NRSTS  and  7/38  patients  (18.4%)  had  non-high  risk  metastatic  RMS  vs.  14/39  patients  (35.9%), 
20/39 (51.3%), and 5/39 (12.8%), respectively, in the low PlGF level group (< p = 0.01).  
Previous  biomarker  analyses  have  described  an  increase  in  the  circulating  concentration  of  PlGF  in 
response  to  VEGF-targeted  treatment  as  a  pharmacodynamic  marker  but  not  as  a  predictive  marker 
(Batchelor  2006,  Rini  2008,  Willett  2009).  In  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  no  increase  in  PlGF  levels  was 
observed from baseline to Cycle 5 Day 1 and maintenance therapy Cycle 5 Day1. 
Tumor VEGFA 
Analyses of EFS and OS by tVEGFA (IHC assessed) shows a HR of 1.48 (95% CI: 0.67, 3.28) and for 
OS  analysis  it  was  0.91  (95%  CI:  0.38,  2.19)  in  the  Chemo  arm  vs.  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  in  the 
tVEGFA-evaluable  population.  Furthermore,  no  significant  change  was  seen  for  the  baseline  high 
tVEGFA level subgroup dichotomized at the first quartile (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 0.50, 4.39) and median 
(HR= 1.36; 95% CI: 0.36, 5.10) for EFS analysis, as well for the OS analysis dichotomized at the first 
quartile (HR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.25, 2.87) and median (HR = 0.81; 95% CI: 0.20, 3.28). 
In  a  Cox  regression  analysis  for  OS  including  trial  treatment,  baseline  biomarker  level  and  the 
interaction term of treatment by biomarker level, there was no indication of a treatment by biomarker 
level interaction. Based on the limited data, no predictive value could be concluded for baseline tVEGFA 
as a biomarker for the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment. 
Safety results 
Of the 154 patients in the Intent-to-Treat population, 4 patients did not receive any study treatment. 
The  remaining  150  patients  were  included  in  the  safety-evaluable  population  (79  in  the  Chemo  arm 
and 71 in the Bv + Chemo arm). 
Key safety data include the following: 
Overall,  the  toxicity  profile  observed  in  Study  BO20924  patients  appears  to  be  that  which  might  be 
expected  in  adults  exposed  to  bevacizumab  and  the  chemotherapy  backbone  in  the  disease  under 
study. All patients in the safety-evaluable population experienced at least one adverse event (AE). No 
fatal AEs were reported. All deaths were attributed to disease progression.

68 of 79 patients (86.1%) in the Chemo arm and 66 of 71 patients (93.0%) in the Bv + Chemo arm 
experienced at least one SAE. The SAEs that were reported at an incidence > 5% in patients receiving 
Bv + Chemo were: 
• 
• 
• 
Febrile neutropenia (46 patients [64.8%]) 
Febrile bone marrow aplasia (19 patients [26.8%]) 
Pyrexia (14 patients [19.7%]) 
•  Mucosal inflammation (10 patients [14.1%]) 
•  Vomiting (8 patients [11.3%]) 
•  Weight decreased (5 patients [7.0%]) 
•  Anaemia (4 patients [5.6%]) 
•  Neutropenic infection (4 patients [5.6%]) 
•  Seizure (4 patients [5.6%]) 
•  Diarrhea (4 patients [5.6%]) 
•  Decreased appetite (4 patients [5.6%]). 
AEs that led to study chemotherapy discontinuation were reported in a total of 12 patients: 6  patients 
in the Chemo arm and 6 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm.  AEs that led to bevacizumab discontinuation 
were reported in a total of 8 patients (left ventricular dysfunction most commonly reported as causing 
discontinuation [3/8 patients]).  
79 patients [100%] in the Chemo arm and 70 patients [98.6%] in the Bv + Chemo armexperienced at 
least one Grade 3 − 5 AE. The total numbers of Grade 3-5 AEs were higher in the Bv  +  Chemo arm. 
Three  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  were  reported  with  at  least  a  10%  difference  in  frequency  between  treatment 
arms: neutropenia, anaemia, and febrile bone marrow aplasia, which were all more frequently reported 
in the Bv + Chemo arm. Forty-six patients (64.8%) in the Bv + Chemo arm experienced at least one 
adverse event of special interest (AESI), versus 32 patients (40.5%) in the Chemo arm. The rate of ≥ 
Grade 3 AESIs was equivalent between the two study treatment arms: 12.7% in each arm.

As of the clinical cutoff date, no pregnancies had been reported on study. 
Bone toxicity was monitored by qualitative observations from X-rays of the patient’s left wrist and the 
development of any skeletal abnormalities, as indicated by the occurrence of symptoms, in particular 
pain  associated  with  bones  or  joints.  More  patients  in  the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  (16  of  71  patients 
[22.5%]): than in the Chemo arm (12 of 79 patients [15.2%]) arm experienced at least one qualifying 
bone toxicity AE. Among these, the most common bone toxicities were arthralgia (10 patients [14.1%] 
in the  Bv +  Chemo arm vs. 8 patients [10.1%] in the Chemo arm); bone pain (4 patients [5.6%] in 
the Bv + Chemo arm vs. 2 patients [2.5%] in the Chemo arm); and foot fracture (2 patients [2.8%] in 
the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  vs.  no  patients  in  the  Chemo  arm).  No  AEs  of  osteonecrosis  were  reported  in 
either treatment arm. 
Seventy-nine patients in the Chemo arm (median height 147.0 cm) and 70 patients in the Bv + Chemo 
arm  (median  height  147.0  cm)  were  evaluated  for  standing  height  at  baseline  from  the  safety-
evaluable population. At follow-up, 19 patients (24.1%) in the Chemo arm and 17 patients (23.9%) in

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

the  Bv  +  Chemo  arm  were  evaluated  as  pre-pubertal.  No  clear  pattern  was  observed  on  standing 
height between arms. 
At baseline, 49 patients in the Chemo arm and 40 patients in the Bv + Chemo arm were evaluated for 
sitting  height.  Too  few  patients  (fewer  than  20  in  either  arm  at  any  time  point  after  baseline)  had 
subsequent  evaluations  performed  to  allow  conclusions  to  be  drawn  regarding  differences  between 
treatment  arms  in  changes  from  baseline.  The  difference  in  sample  sizes between  standing/lying  and 
sitting height was mainly due to the patients’ clinical status but also to the difficulty of measuring siting 
height in a population of young patients 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on clinical aspects 
As  also  concluded by  the MAH  Study  BO20924  did not  meet  its  primary  endpoint  of improved  EFS  in 
the Bv + Chemo arm. HR for IRC-assessed EFS was estimated as 0.93 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.41; p-value = 
0.72).  Per  IRC,  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  ORR  was  seen  between  the  two  treatment  arms: 
27/75 patients (36.0%, 95% CI: 25.2%, 47.9%) in the Chemo arm and 34/63 patients (54.0%, 95% 
CI: 40.9%, 66.6%) in the Bv + Chemo arm were assessed as having had a confirmed response prior 
to receiving any local therapy in Study BO20924.  
Additional  subgroup  analysis  performed  for  the  IRC  assessed  EFS  were  consistent  with  the  primary 
analysis  with  the  exception  of  patients  with  local  surgery  radiotherapy  and  patients  without  any  local 
therapy. Due to small numbers of patients in these subgroups, no conclusion could be drawn. 
Biomarker analyses did not show any useful results. 
The  safety  profile  observed  in  Study  BO20924  patients  appeared  to  be  largely  consistent  with  that 
which might be expected in adults exposed to bevacizumab and/or the chemotherapy backbone in the 
disease.  The  Pharmacokinetics  of  paediatric  patients  in  Study  BO20924  were  well  characterized  by  a 
paediatric  PopPK  model,  with  similar  PK-associated  covariates  as  in  adults,  and  with  the  expected 
bevacizumab PK with a slow systemic clearance, volume of distribution that approximates the plasma 
volume, and long half-life. 
. An addendum CSR is expected to be generated in the third quarter of 2019, when the OS endpoint 
has been reached and Study BO20924 has been completed. Updated OS results as well as safety data 
will be made available at that time and the benefit-risk reassessed. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Roche  Registration  Ltd  has  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Avastin  in  accordance  with 
Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended.  The  provided  study,  BO20924  (BERNIE),  a 
randomized,  comparative,  open-label,  multi-center  Phase  II  study  evaluating  the  benefit  of  the 
addition  of  bevacizumab  to  chemotherapy  in  children  and  adolescent  patients  presenting  with 
metastatic  rhabdomyosarcoma  and  non-rhabdomyosarcoma  soft  tissue  sarcoma,  did  not  meet  its 
primary endpoint of improved EFS in the Bv + Chemo arm. It is agreed, that based on the presented 
data,  the  benefit-risk  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  multimodal  therapy  in  this  population  is  not 
possible to assess. When the updated OS results as well as safety data will be made available in 2019 
re-assessment  may  be  conducted  in  order  to  further  pursue  the  benefit  risk  in  the  metastatic 
rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma indication. The MAH has indicated 
that  a  variation  is  to  be  submitted  in  2016  in  order  to  update the  SmPC  with  paediatric  data.  This  is 
endorsed.

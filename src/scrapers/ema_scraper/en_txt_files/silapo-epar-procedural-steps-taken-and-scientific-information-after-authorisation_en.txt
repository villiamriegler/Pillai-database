Submission of the final report from the registry 
06/07/2017 
n/a 
The submitted study is a registry based health care 
based healthcare database study linked to PASCO 
(PMS-830-07-0043)) listed as a category 3 study in 
the RMP. This is an observational study on the 
incidence of thromboembolic events in patients with 
renal anaemia treated with erythropoietin-zeta as 
compared with erythropoietin-alpha and other 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In addition, an 
updated RMP (version 11) is submitted to reflect the 
outcome of the study. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
database study (HDBS-study) linked to PASCO (Post- 
Authorisation Safety Cohort Observation of Epoetin zeta 
Administered Intravenously for the Treatment of Renal 
Anaemia). The study aimed to compare the crude incidence 
rate (with 95% CIs) of thromboembolic events in patients 
with renal anaemia treated with epoetin zeta vs. other 
epoetins (including epoetin alpha). Overall, no increased 
thromboembolic risk for epoetin zeta compared to the other 
epoetins in clinical practice can be derived from the data 
provided. No new safety concern associated with epoetin 
zeta was identified. The findings did not warrant changes to 
the product information.

insufficiency not yet undergoing analysis". SPC

As a result of this variation, the respective SPC/PL-sections 
outlining the mode of administration of Epoetin zeta have 
been amended. Consequently the section "Conditions or 
restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the

some additional changes to Sections 4.2 and 5.1 of

following the completion of a class safety review by the 
PhVWP and the CHMP. The safety review was initiated 
because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins. 
As a result, CHMP requested to update section 4.4 of the 
SPC to include an additional ESA class warning in the 
epoetins with cancer indication. In addition The MAH has 
made changes in section 4.2 and 5.1 of the SPC in order to 
clarify the posology and method of administration of the

This variation primarily concerns an update of the SPC 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Labelling and 
following the completion of a class safety review by the 
PL 
PhVWP and the CHMP. The safety review was initiated 
because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in 
patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively 
high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated 
with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular 
morbidity.  
As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in 
section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only 
if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish 
a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in 
Section 4.4 to mention the observed negative benefit risk 
balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin 
concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the 
relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. 
The package leaflet has also been updated accordingly. 
The MAH also took this opportunity to perform some minor 
changes in section 6.4 of the SPC, in the Package Leaflet

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Isentress (raltegravir) is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor active against the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1). Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of integrase, an HIV-encoded 
enzyme that is required for viral replication. Inhibition of integrase prevents integration of the HIV 
genome into the host cell genome. HIV genomes that fail to integrate cannot direct the production of 
new infectious viral particles, so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection. 
Isentress is indicated in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products for the treatment of 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients. This indication is based on safety 
and efficacy data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in treatment-experienced patients 
and one double-blind, active-controlled trial in treatment-naïve patients.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Isentress 25 mg chewable tablets are presented as pale yellow round debossed tablets containing 
27.16 mg of raltegravir potassium, equivalent to 25 mg raltegravir. Isentress 100 mg chewable tablets 
are presented as pale orange oval shaped scored and debossed tablets containing 108.6 mg of 
raltegravir potassium, equivalent to 100 mg raltegravir. The scored 100 mg tablets can be broken in 
half along the score line to provide a 50 mg dose. 
The list of excipients can be found in section 6.1 of the SmPC. The tablets are presented in HDPE 
bottles with a polypropylene child-resistant screw cap and silica gel desiccant.  Each bottle contains 60 
tablets. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Raltegravir potassium, the active substance in Isentress 25 mg and 100 mg chewable tablets is 
identical to the active substance in the authorized Isentress 400 mg film-coated tablets 
(EU/1/07/436/001-002). Raltegravir is classified as a BCS class II compound, it has a high 
permeability and low solubility at physiological pH. For information on the active substance reference is 
made to Module 3.2.S of the marketing authorisation of the 400 mg strength and subsequent quality 
variations. The active substance specifications are the same as for the 400 mg tablet, with the 
Isentress Assessment report

exception of the particle size for which a narrower acceptance limit was set in order to match the 
particle size of the excipient mannitol.   
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim was to develop a paediatric formulation for Isentress, suitable for use in children down to two 
years old, who would not be able to swallow the 400 mg marketed adult tablet. The development 
focused on finding an effective, palatable dosage form with acceptable size. Clinical needs required the 
development of two strengths; 25 mg and 100 mg.  
In view of the above Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), the applicant identified the following 
medicinal product’s critical quality attributes (CQA): identity, assay, appearance, elegance, impurities, 
dissolution, dose uniformity, and deliver suitable stability. 
The applicant studied several dosage forms, including orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), chewable 
tablets and oral granules for suspension. In view of the target population and the bitter taste of the 
active substance raltegravir, taste masking was identified as an important attribute during the 
development.  
The first step in the development was to develop coated raltegravir granules to achieve taste masking. 
These taste-masked granules were used as a common starting material for all three formulations. 
Then, an adequate flavouring system was developed, and the most appropriate dosage form was 
selected.  
Different taste masking systems for paediatric use were evaluated and a granule coating based on 
Surelease (an ethylcellulose dispersion) and Opadry (a coating suspension) was selected for the final 
formulation. Ethylcellulose provides taste masking via delayed release due to its insolubility, and when 
used in the right combination with Opadry, it delays drug release in the oral cavity but still allows 
immediate release of the drug once in the stomach. 
After the development of the taste-masked granules, the applicant focussed on the flavour 
development and selection of the dosage form. Chewable tablets seemed to be most appropriate based 
on dissolution data and biocomparability to the initial ODT formulation and the effectiveness of the 
flavor system based on patient responses to a questionnaire. The chewable tablet formulation required 
substantial flavor development, because chewing causes some breakage of the taste masking coating, 
increasing mouth exposure to raltegravir. The flavour development focussed on overcoming the overall 
basicity of the formulation and included immediate and delayed onset flavouring agents to provide an 
acceptable flavor. A combination of orange flavor, bitter masking flavor, and banana flavor was chosen 
for chewable tablets for their particular attributes. The selected flavouring system also includes 
saccharin and sucralose (two fast onset sweeteners) to provide acceptable sweetness, Magnasweet (a 
delayed onset sweetener based on monoammonium glycyrrhizinate) to minimize the aftertaste, and 
mannitol to improve the feel and cooling sensation in the mouth. Questionnaires distributed during 
clinical trials indicated that the taste acceptability requirements were met. The rationale for the 
selection of the excipients is adequately explained and justified taking into account the safety profile of 
these excipients in children. The excipients comply with the Ph.Eur or USP, and the flavouring agents 
comply with Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 relating to flavourings for use in foods. No novel excipients 
are used in the manufacture of Isentress chewable tablets. The full list of excipients can be found in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 9/45 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant applied a quality by design (QbD) approach during the development of the 
manufacturing process of the chewable tablets. Design of experiments were performed at development 
scale to increase process understanding of the granulation and coating step and to define univariate 
proven acceptable ranges (PAR). A thorough risk analysis was performed for the entire manufacturing 
process to identify the critical process parameters. The results of the risk analysis were used to define 
the control strategy to ensure that all CQA and the associated QTPP requirements are achieved and 
that the manufacturing process is robust and reproducible. 
The primary packaging proposed is a HDPE bottle with a polypropylene child-resistant screw cap and 
silica gel desiccant. Desiccant is included to mitigate risk to product quality from exposure to elevated 
humidity conditions. The material complies with the relevant European Directives and pharmacopoeial 
monographs and is adequate to support the stability and use of the medicinal product. 
Adventitious agents 
Isentress  chewable  tablets  do  not  contain  materials  of  animal  or  human  origin.  Assurance  has  been 
provided that the magnesium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate are of vegetable origin only.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of the chewable tablets consists of a 4-step process and includes 
delumping and granulation of the drug substance, coating of the drug granules (taste masking), 
blending and compression. Comprehensive details have been provided on the development and 
optimisation of the manufacturing process. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing 
process.  
Critical manufacturing steps have been identified and adequate in-process controls are in place. The 
test methods and acceptance criteria are considered adequate. Batch analysis data on four 25 mg and 
four 100 mg batches (pilot scale or larger) show that the chewable tablets can be manufactured 
reproducible according to the agreed finished product specifications which is suitable for control of this 
oral dosage form. Formal validation of the manufacturing process in the production facility will take 
place prior to release of the product to the market. An acceptable validation summary protocol has 
been provided. This is satisfactory. 
Product specification 
The Isentress 25 mg and 100 mg chewable tablets release specifications include tests for appearance, 
identity (HPLC, FTIR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution, content uniformity, 
microbiological limits, identity of ferric oxide and tablet breakability (100 mg tablet only). The finished 
product specifications are standard for immediate release tablets. The proposed test procedures and 
acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and ICH guidelines. All tests included 
in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data have been 
presented to justify the release specifications for each quality characteristic that is controlled. 
Impurities and degradation products are acceptable from the safety point of view. Batch analysis 
results comply with the predefined specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

Stability of the product 
Stability studies on the chewable tablets have been carried out under long term (30°C/75%RH) and 
accelerated (40°C/75%RH) conditions, on three batches (at least pilot scale), according to the ICH 
requirements. Up to 52 weeks long term and 26 weeks accelerated stability data have been provided  
The batches used for the primary stability studies were prepared in the final market composition and 
the packaging was representative of the packaging planned for use for the commercial product. Up to 
52 weeks additional stability data was provided for bridging batches (at long term and accelerated 
conditions), manufactured at the commercial site. The parameters tested and analytical methods used 
in the stability studies are identical to those used for the release specifications, with the exception of 
identity, content uniformity, microbiological limits and identity of ferric oxide which are tested at 
release only, and hardness which is tested at the end of shelf-life. The analytical methods used were 
stability indicating. No significant changes were observed at any storage condition. 
In-use stability studies were performed to evaluate the risk of tablet discoloration during the in-use 
period (i.e. after the induction seal has been breached). Based on the results no in use shelf-life is 
considered necessary. The applicant confirmed that the in-use stability study will be repeated at the 
end of the expiry period for the chewable tablets. This is acceptable on the basis of the in-use stability 
results obtained so far. 
In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. The results demonstrated that the raltegravir chewable tablets 
can be considered to be stable when exposed to light. Based on the available stability data, the 
proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Isentress 25 mg and 100 mg chewable tablets are paediatric strengths. The chewable tablets are 
manufactured using the same active substance as the authorised 400 mg tablets. Different excipients 
are used however, to make the tablets chewable and palatable. All excipients were found acceptable 
for use in the paediatric population. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were no unresolved quality issues. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Since RAL is already approved by oral route, as film-coated tablets, no additional non-clinical studies 
have been performed to support this application. The MAH has previously submitted juvenile toxicity 
studies in the rat and no additional toxicities were observed in juvenile animals. The CHMP considers 
this approach acceptable.

Key Purpose 
Treatment 
naïve adults 
Evaluate the long-term 
safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of oncedaily 
(q.d) RAL 800 mg PO 
compared with twice 
daily (b.i.d.) RAL 400 
mg PO when each 
was given in 
combination with 
TRUVADA™ for up to 
96 weeks, which was  
extended to 120 
weeks. 
The analytical method for the determination of RAL in human plasma used HPLC-MS/MS. The two 
validated procedures that were used had linear calibration ranges of 1 - 3000 ng/mL and 10 - 10,000 
ng/mL. Separate bio analytical reports have been provided. 
Study 068 
Study 068 was an open label cross over study to compare the adult tablet as marketed with the 
candidate chewable tablet. It also evaluated the effect of food on absorption after dosing with the 
chewable tablet. Subjects each received 4 single dose (400 mg) treatments in a randomised order and 
with at least 4 days of washout between each treatment period. PK samples were obtained over 72h 
after each dosing. 
• 
• 
Treatments A and B were administered in the fasting state.  
Treatment D was administered after a high fat breakfast of 827 kcal and 57% fat content.  
The data from treatment C wasn’t following into the scope of the present application since a different 
formulation was used. 
The comparison between the chewable tablet (treatment B) and adult tablet (FMI poloxamer 
formulation; treatment A) when administered in the fasting state gave a GMR for AUC0-∞ at 1.78 and 
90% CI 1.47, 2.15. The Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) for Cmax was 3.22, with 90% CI 2.37, 4.38. 
Thus, AUC0-∞ and Cmax observed with the chewable tablet were higher than obtained with the 
marketed adult tablet and the two formulations were not bioequivalent. Peak concentrations also 
occurred earlier such that median Tmax was only 0.5 h for the chewable tablet vs. 4 h for the adult 
tablet. The C12h concentrations and half-lives were comparable between formulations.  
The administration of the chewable tablet with a high-fat meal (treatment D) slowed the rate of 
absorption with no statistically meaningful change in the extent of absorption but C12h was improved.  
Study 022 (P1066; IMPAACT) 
Study 022 (P1066; IMPAACT) is an on-going Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative 
study of approximately 140 HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 4 weeks through 18 years of age 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 15/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK parameters and efficacy of raltegravir in combination with an 
optimized background regimen.   
The data discussed as part of the present application are related to raltegravir administered orally as 
the adult tablet or as a chewable tablet (2 through 18 years of age).  A third formulation, oral granules 
for suspension in water, was available to permit study of patients 4 weeks through 2 years of age. 
These data are not part of the present submission. 
Formulations 
•  Adult tablets (100, 200 and 400 mg erodible tablet formulation; note that only the 400 mg tablet is 
approved), 
•  Chewable tablets (25, 50 and 100 mg unscored); the 50 mg has been dropped. 
Note: The 50 mg dose was dropped during the study since this strength was not required to titrate the patients. However, 
the data related to the 50 mg dose were submitted by the applicant in the clinical study report for study P022 which was 
part of the initial submission. 
The 100 mg chewable tablet used in study 068 was of the same formulation and composition as that 
used in study 022. 
Note that the commercial tablet is scored and the applicant performed multimedia (pH 1.2, 4.5, and 
6.8) comparative dissolution profiles using the same dissolution testing conditions to bridge between 
the tablets used in the trial and the commercial ones.  
Data from a study on tablets split by hand that quantitate the equivalence of the resulting halves and 
the amount of powder mass lost during the splitting operation were provided. Comparative dissolution 
data were obtained for 100 mg scored tablet halves vs. the intact tablet. Hence, the 100 mg chewable 
tablet can be divided into equal 50 mg doses; however, as indicated in the SmPC, it is not 
recommended to break the tablets since it is possible to build the dosage with whole 25mg and 100mg 
chewable tablets. 
Since the tablets and the chewable tablets are not bioequivalent, the following statement has been 
included on the outer carton and on the bottle label the statement "Do not switch between the 
chewable tablets and the 400 mg tablet, without first talking with your doctor."  
Objectives 
The study design is further described in the section 2.5. The clinical pharmacology objectives were: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the steady state plasma concentration profiles and PK parameters of raltegravir in 
children and adolescents.  
To evaluate the steady state plasma concentration profiles and PK parameters of raltegravir 
administered as a poloxamer tablet, a chewable tablet or oral granules for suspension. 
To collect sparse concentration-time data to create a population PK model to describe paediatric 
exposure to raltegravir and to assess drug-drug interactions. 
The aim was to determine a formulation-specific paediatric dose that would provide approximately the 
same plasma exposure to that achieved in adults using 400 mg BID delivered with the marketed 
tablet. On this basis the target minimum exposure for each cohort was a GM AUC0-12h between 14 and 
25 μM·hr with a concurrent GM C12h exceeding 33 nM (i.e. the IC95). Additionally, for safety 
considerations, the maximum AUC0-12h was to be < 45 μM·hr, which represents half the AUC0-24h that 
was observed when 1600 mg was administered in Phase I studies.

Methods 
Figure 1.  Study design P1066 (DLP 14/02/2012) 
Note: The week 48 data for Cohort III was submitted with the responses to the D120 LoQ (DLP 15/07/2012) 
Stage I examined PK, short-term tolerability and safety in a limited number of patients to permit dose 
selection for further study in Stage II. Stage I commenced with dosing Cohort I and progressed 
sequentially to the younger cohorts, in each case obtaining preliminary data from a mini-cohort. The 
background ARV was optimised after sampling for PK evaluation.  
Stage II involved raltegravir dosing for 48 weeks with an optimised background ARV regimen. Sparse 
PK sampling was performed during the chronic dosing stage.  
Upon completion of 48 weeks study treatment raltegravir was made available to patients via a protocol 
extension inclusive of 5 years from initial exposure. 
Cohorts I (≥ 12 to 18 years - adult tablets) and Cohort IIA (≥ 6 to < 12 years - adult tablets) 
received poloxamer film-coated tablets twice daily (same formulation as the approved 400 mg tablet). 
Three strengths (100, 200, and 400 mg) were provided for dosing flexibility.  
Cohorts IIB (≥ 6 to < 12 years - chewable tablets) and III (≥ 2 to < 6 years - chewable tablets) 
received chewable tablets twice daily. Three strengths (25, 50, and 100 mg) were initially provided to 
allow dosing flexibility in 25 mg intervals but the 50 mg dose strength was later removed. 
Intensive PK sampling 
It was performed for all patients in Stage I of each cohort and also following an initial dose or dose 
change of raltegravir. Intensive PK sampling occurred between Days 5 and 12 after the first raltegravir 
dose and between Days 7 and 14 after dose adjustment. There was witnessed dosing at approximately 
12 hours after the previous dose. Samples were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 
hours post dose. The large majority of patients had plasma concentrations at all time points well above 
the LLOQ. 
Of note, patients were fasted only on the day of PK collection during the intensive PK sampling phase; 
on all other study days, administration of raltegravir was allowed irrespective of food intake.  
Population PK sampling  
It was performed for all patients in Stages I and II at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 24. One blood sample was 
collected between 10 and 14 hours post dose at Weeks 4 and 12; two blood samples separated by 2

hours were collected between 0.5 and 6 hours post dose at Week 8; and two samples separated by 2 
hours were collected between 6 and 12 hours post dose at Week 24.  
Dose-finding  
Dose-finding with adult tablet formulation (using 100, 200 and 400 mg tablet sizes) 
The figure below shows the progression of studied doses and resulting PK parameter values for Cohorts 
I (≥ 12 to 18 years) and IIA (≥ 6 to < 12 years) using the adult tablet formulation. 
Figure 2.  Schematic of studied and associated PK parameter values for cohort I and IIA (adult tablets) 
The first four patients in Cohort I (≥ 12 to < 19 years), Stage 1 received ~6 mg/kg BID (maximum 
dose 800 mg) using the adult tablet and under non-fasted conditions. The full Cohort I did not meet 
the AUC PK targets. Since food may have contributed to a lower observed AUC, intensive PK sampling 
under fasting conditions led to dose adjustment to ~8 mg/kg BID (maximum dose of 600 mg). 
Subsequently, 11 new patients were enrolled in Cohort I for intensive PK evaluations after dosing in 
the fasting state. The dose adjustment to 8 mg/kg twice daily meant that the majority of the patients 
actually received 400 mg twice daily giving a range of 6.7 to 10.5 mg/kg. Data obtained showed that 
on dosing with ~8mg/kg the GM AUC0-12hr (15.7 μM·hr) and C12h values (333 nM) for this cohort fell 
within the pre-defined targets. It was concluded that 400 mg BID would provide mean PK parameter 
values within the target range. 
For Cohort IIA (≥ 6 to < 12 years), dosing was initiated in four patients at 8 mg/kg BID using adult 
tablet formulations under non-fasted conditions and then 10 new patients were enrolled to receive ~8 
mg/kg BID (maximum dose 600 mg) using adult tablet formulations under fasted conditions. The initial 
dose of approximately 8 mg/kg twice daily gave a GM AUC0-12hr (12.0 μM·hr) below the minimum 
target of 14 μM·hr. A fixed dose of 400 mg BID for all patients was then administered and resulted in 
GM AUC0-12hr (15.8 μM·hr) and C12hr values (246 nM) that met the pre-defined targets.  
Isentress Assessment report

Two subjects with weights below 25 kg had extremely high AUC0-12hr values when administered 400 mg 
BID while a third subject had AUC0-12hr below the target value. On the contrary, the AUC0-12hr values in 
children aged 6 with body weight ≥ 25 kg were nearly identical to those observed in adults.  
Based on these findings, it is recommended to use a fixed dose of the adult formulation 400 BID when 
body weight is ≥ 25 kg in children aged 6 to 18 years. 
Dose-finding with chewable tablets (using 25, 50 and 100 mg tablet sizes) 
The next figure shows the progression of studied doses and resulting PK parameter values for Cohorts 
IIB (≥ 6 to < 12 years) and III (≥ 2 to < 6 years) when dosed with the chewable tablet.  
Figure 3.  Schematic of studied and associated PK parameter values for cohort IIB and III (chewable 
tablets) 
Note – The tables mentioned in the figure were included in the marketing authorisation application  
The first 4 subjects enrolled in Cohort IIB received approximately 8 mg/kg twice daily, which resulted 
in a GM AUC0-12hr that was greater than the pre-defined range of 25 μM·hr. Therefore the dose was 
reduced to approximately 6 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 300 mg twice daily. Six additional 
subjects were enrolled at the revised dose and the original subjects had their dose changed. The 
resulting geometric mean AUC0-12hr and C12hr were within the target ranges. Hence, a dose of 
approximately 6 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg) twice daily of the chewable tablet was chosen for 
continued study in the age group 6-11 years.  
Twelve patients were enrolled in Stage 1 of Cohort III. Using the recommended 6mg/kg dosing the GM 
AUC0-12hr and C12hr were within the target ranges. 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 19/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weight-based dosing of the chewable tablet for children ages 6 to less than 12 years old with body 
weight < 25 kg was considered to be supported by examination of clearance as a function of weight. 
Indeed, clearance values appear relatively constant in children with body weight ≥25 kg, and begin to 
trend downward with decreasing weights below 25 kg, suggesting that weight-based dosing would be 
more appropriate for those < 25 kg to maintain similar exposures to those seen in adults.   
Since the minimum weight reported in this study was 11.8 kg and there were only seven children in 
Stage I with weights between 11.8 and 14 kg, the chewable tablets should be used from 12 kg 
upwards. 
Based on these findings, it is recommended to use the weight based regimen of 6mg/kg, to maximum 
dose 300 mg, twice daily, of the chewable tablets when body weight is ≥ 12 kg in children aged 2 to 
12 years. 
Analyses 
Both intensive and sparse PK data were collected in this study. Since intensive PK data were collected 
under the most controlled conditions and with observed dosing, intensive PK assessments provide most 
accurate estimate of PK parameters associated with the administered dose. Hence, the data from the 
intensive PK data were considered more closely during the application. 
Analyses based on sparse sampling data 
For all Cohorts, the three non-model based exposure summary measures that were calculated based 
on the observed sparse concentration data were: 
•  Call = GM of all samples for a particular patient, regardless of time of collection 
•  GM C12h = GM of all samples for a particular patient collected between 10-14 h post-dose  
•  Cmin = minimum value of all samples for a particular patient, regardless of time of collection  
Concentrations that were < LLOQ (10 ng/mL) were assigned a value of ½*LLOQ = 5 ng/mL = 11 nM. 
Values of the non-model based parameters for the Final Dose population from sparse concentration 
data are shown in the table 2.  
Table 2.  Geometric Mean (%CV) values for Non-Model based RAL PK parameters calculated from 
sparse concentration data (cohorts I, IIA, IIB, III, final dose population) 
There was less variability in PK observed when dosing with chewable tablets versus the adult tablet 
based on all the intensive sampling data obtained in the fasting state. On this basis, no modelling was 
conducted using the data from Cohorts I and IIA in which the adult tablet was used. A model was 
developed using the data from Cohorts IIB and III in which the chewable tablet was used to estimate 
values of AUC0-12hr, Cmax and C12hr based on the sparse concentration data. Values of the model-
based parameters for the Final Dose population on the sparse concentration data are shown in the 
table 3.

  †Number of patients with intensive pharmacokinetic (PK) results at the final recommended dose. 
  ‡Patients in this age group received approximately 8 mg/kg dose at time of intensive PK which met PK and 
safety targets. Based on review of the individual profiles and receipt of a mean dose of 390 mg, 400 mg 
twice daily was selected as the recommended dose for this age group.  
Chewable tablet doses 
There was no obvious trend in Cohorts IIB and III for the PK parameters values to vary by dose or 
tablet potency received (i.e. 25mg, 100mg). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Study 071 
Study 071 was a phase III multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical 
trial to study the safety and efficacy of once daily raltegravir versus twice daily raltegravir, each in 
combination with Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), in treatment-naïve HIV 
infected patients. Study 071 showed a statistically significant difference between 400 mg BID and 800 
mg QD regimens in the pre-defined primary analysis at Week 48.  
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 21/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data comparing regimens containing raltegravir 400 mg BID vs. 800 mg QD in this study have 
suggested a PK/PD relationship with Ctrough, where low Ctrough in the 800 mg QD arm was associated 
with a higher probability of virologic failure. Indeed, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
identified this threshold Ctrough of 45 nM. This was consistent with the results of a quartile analysis, 
showing a lower efficacy response in patients in the lowest quartile of Ctrough values in the 800 mg QD 
arm of the study, where the upper bound of the lowest quartile was a Ctrough value of 43 nM. 
The failure to demonstrate non-inferiority for 800 mg QD vs. 400 mg BID and the differences in PK, 
especially with respect to Ctrough, were informative to the CHMP with regard to RAL PK/PD relationship 
and the relative importance of C12h (effectively Ctrough) versus AUC. Though it is not been possible to 
identify a robust threshold for Ctrough, the available data suggest a threshold value ~ 45 nM. Hence, 
though it was not part of the original PK target definition for study 022, this information has been 
taken into account in the present assessment. 
Study 022 
Analyses based on sparse sampling data 
The following assumptions were made for the PK/PD analysis: dosing history and sampling times were 
collected appropriately, plasma concentrations are at steady state for all visits where PK was collected 
such that longitudinal variation in PK does not need to be considered (except for the time points where 
there is a change in dose), samples drawn at different visits can thus be pooled together. 
Exploratory plots of PK/PD associations were made between the various PK parameters and each of the 
efficacy parameters. To assess the effect of PK parameter (GM C12hr or GM Call) on the two efficacy 
endpoints a logistic regression model with PK parameter and baseline HIV RNA level as predictors was 
used. These two factors were assumed to have no interaction.  
Based on all patients in the Final Dose population there were statistically significant associations 
detected for all combinations of sparse PK parameters and efficacy measures in the analyses of data 
from all four Cohorts and from Cohorts I and IIA (adult tablet) but not for Cohorts IIB and III 
(chewable tablet). When those with ≥ 2 BLOQ PK values were removed from the analysis, statistically 
significant relationships were detected only between GM C12h and HIV RNA <50 copies/mL for all four 
cohorts. Of note, a statistically significant relationship between GM C12h and HIV RNA <50 at Week 48 
of treatment was also observed in treatment-experienced adults in studies 018 and 019 (submitted as 
part of the initial marketing authorisation application) but consistent relationships between GM C12h 
and other efficacy endpoints (e.g. HIV RNA < 400, virological failure and presence of resistance 
mutations) were not observed. 
These data should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of patients, the large 
inter- and intra-subject variability in raltegravir PK and the small number of samples that went into the 
calculation of GM C12h for each patient (median = 2). In addition, the BLOQ values potentially 
represent lack of adherence to the treatment regimen. In this regard, the pill count data are difficult to 
interpret given the large amount of missing data. 
The virological response rates were highest in patients with no or only one value BLOQ and these 
patients mostly had GM Call values above 100 nM. In addition, for all Cohorts pooled in the Final Dose 
population, 64.2% with no BLOQ values achieved HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24 compared to 
35.7% with 1 BLOQ value and 23.1% with multiple BLOQ values. 
The sparse PK data collected in pediatric patients, and using the threshold value of ~ 45 nM, the 
distribution of individual Ctrough values obtained using the chewable tablet formulation are shown in  
Figure 4. These data confirm that the yield Ctrough >45 nM in the large majority of patients. The

percentage of patients with Ctrough < 45 nM is ~11% in the youngest age group (2 to less than 6 years 
of age), which is reasonably consistent with results from the intensive PK analysis, and smaller than 
that observed with 800 mg QD in adults (27%). The analysis shown treats values BLOQ as missing, 
which assumes these values are due to non-compliance (which no amount of dose adjustment will 
address) rather than suboptimal dosing.

Analyses based on intensive PK data 
The intensive PK data collected in pediatric patients, and using the threshold value of ~ 45 nM, the 
distribution of individual Ctrough values obtained using the chewable tablet formulation are shown in 
Figure 5. For the chewable tablet, none of the ten patients in Cohort IIB (6 to less than 12 years old) 
had Ctrough less than 45 nM, and, for Cohort III (2 to less than 6 year olds), there were 1 or 2 patients 
out of 12 with Ctrough <45 nM. Note that one of these two values, the very low trough value, is not a 
measured value – due to administration of a dose in this patient between 8 and 12 hours postdose that 
invalidated the nominal C12hr sample collected, the value shown was extrapolated using a very 
conservative method and is very likely an underestimate. The observed distribution of Ctrough for 
children receiving the chewable tablet is above that observed for adults receiving 800 mg QD of 
raltegravir in study 077, where 12 of 22 patients (54%) had C trough values below 45 nM.

Both the film-coated and chewable tablets in Cohorts I to III met the pre-specified PK targets. The GM 
Ctrough decreased with decreasing age, while there was no consistent trend for the GM AUC. The 
number and proportion with AUC < 14 nM was not higher in the cohorts that received 6 mg/kg using 
chewable tablets vs. the Cohorts that received adult tablets. With the exception of 800 mg once daily, 
which is not an approved regimen, the individual numbers with Ctrough < 45 nM were 0-2 per group. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 071 was a phase III multicenter, double-blind, randomized, active comparator-controlled clinical 
trial to study the safety and efficacy of once daily raltegravir versus twice daily raltegravir, each in 
combination with Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), in treatment-naïve HIV 
infected patients. Study 071 showed a statistically significant difference between 400 mg BID and 800 
mg QD regimens in the pre-defined primary analysis at Week 48. The failure to demonstrate non-
inferiority for 800 mg QD vs. 400 mg BID and the differences in PK, especially with respect to C trough, 
were informative to the CHMP with regard to RAL PK/PD relationship and the relative importance of 
C12h (effectively Ctrough) versus AUC. 
Study 022 is an ongoing Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative study in HIV-1 infected 
children and adolescents ages ≥4 weeks to <19 years of age to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy of raltegravir.  
Patients were stratified by age, enrolling adolescents first (Cohort I) and then successively younger 
children. Patients received either the 400 mg film-coated tablet formulation (Cohorts I and IIA; 6 
through 18 years of age) or the chewable tablet formulation (Cohorts IIB and III; 2 through 11 years 
of age). Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen. 
Study 022 design includes two stages. The initial dose-finding stage (Stage I) included intensive 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. Dose selection for each cohort was based upon achieving similar 
raltegravir plasma exposure as seen in adults, and adequate trough concentrations based on the in 
vitro IC95 for antiviral activity. Specifically, the goal was to maintain both a GM AUC0-12hr between 14 
and 25 uM*hr and a GM C 12hr greater than 33 nM (the in vitro IC95), as well as to demonstrate 
acceptable short term safety. After dose selection, additional patients were enrolled (Stage II) for 
evaluation of long term safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Sparse PK sampling was performed during the 
chronic dosing stage. Of the 126 patients enrolled (All Treated population) in Cohorts I to III, 96 
patients received only the recommended dose of raltegravir, and are considered the Final Dose 
population. 
Data and additional analyses 
Study 022 aimed to identify regimens providing comparable plasma exposure to that achieved in 
adults when dosed at 400 mg BID using the marketed tablets. In principle, this is an appropriate and 
sufficient approach for selecting a paediatric dose schema when the PK/PD is expected to be the same 
in children as in adults. The target GM AUC0-12h was based on data obtained from HIV-1 infected adults 
during 400 mg BID monotherapy and on dosing along with tenofovir and lamivudine while the target 
C12h corresponded to the in-vitro IC95 for antiviral activity. Since two formulations were proposed for 
use and since the two were shown not to be bioequivalent, separate dose recommendations were 
identified, with an option to use either formulation in the age group 6-11 years.  
The objective of Study 022 dose finding was to match overall exposure (AUC) observed with 400 mg 
BID regimen in adults (geometric mean (GM) value 14 - 25 μM·hr), and maintain reasonable GM Ctrough 
Isentress Assessment report

levels, in this case defined as above the IC95 of 33 nM. Both the film-coated and chewable tablets in 
Cohorts I to III met the pre-specified PK targets. 
CV% was lower with the chewable tablets versus adult poloxamer tablets. Across the study Cohorts it 
is also clear that CV% is not higher when using chewable tablets in IIB and III as compared to adults 
and to Cohorts I and IIA, which were dosed with 400 mg BID.   
The CHMP considered that the data from study 071 were informative with regard to the PK/PD 
relationship and the relative importance of C12h (effectively Ctrough) vs. AUC. Indeed, the failure to 
demonstrate non-inferiority for 800 mg QD vs. 400 mg BID could be attributable to the low C trough 
values. It has not been possible to identify a robust threshold but the available data suggest a 
threshold value ~ 45 nM.  
The GM Ctrough in study 022 decreased with decreasing age, while there was no consistent trend for the 
GM AUC.  
Although the GM Ctrough in study 022 was lower in cohort IIB compared to cohort IIA, the number and 
proportion with AUC < 14 nM was not higher in the cohorts that received 6 mg/kg using chewable 
tablets vs. the Cohorts that received adult tablets. Likewise, the number of patients with Ctrough < 45 
nM were comparable. Hence, the two formulations (chewable tablets and tablets) were considered 
suitable for the age range 6 to 11 years. 
However, due to the very limited sample size in this trial, some uncertainties remained during the 
application regarding the downward trend in mean Ctrough levels with decreasing age and the 
applicability of the target minimum Ctrough to young children, who may have high viral loads before 
starting a RAL-containing regimen. Hence, the applicant was invited to an Oral Explanation during the 
September CHMP meeting. 
During this meeting, satisfactory clarification and reassurance were provided by the applicant. Indeed, 
based on the Ctrough threshold of ~45 nM, the intensive sampling data and the CV% values support the 
dosing recommendations, regardless of the fact that GM Ctrough derived from intensive sampling drifts 
downwards with decreasing age. The individual numbers with Ctrough < 45 nM were 0-2 per age 
group/dose cohort as summarised in Table 5. Focusing on the Ctrough comparisons, neither the 
intensive nor the (calculation-corrected) sparse sampling Ctrough suggest that there would be a higher 
risk of values below 33 (or even 45) nM when using the chewable tablets from the age of 2 years 
compared with other age group / dose cohort. 
The need for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) in children aged 2 to 6 years was discussed during 
the Oral Explanation; however, the CHMP considered that TDM wasn’t required to monitor the 
exposure in this population. 
Given the limited number of patients enrolled in this paediatric study 022, the CHMP requested the 
applicant to collect additional data in children aged 2 to <6 years of age to provide further data on the 
adequacy of the recommended posology with particular reference to the threshold value of Ctrough ~ 
45nM.  
The applicant will therefore collect additional PK information through a sub study of IMPAACT P1066. In 
approximately 10 patients receiving chewable tablets, who may have enrolled in study P022 to receive 
the oral granules formulation, Ctrough from non-observed dosing (11-13 hrs post dose) would be 
obtained.  These data are expected with the coming application presenting the results of study P022 in 
the younger age group (i.e. 4 weeks to 2 years of age). This information will be especially relevant for 
children who may have high viral loads before starting a RAL-containing regimen.  
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 26/45 
 
 
 
 
 
Should the actual data suggest a substantial risk that levels fall below 45 nM then the CHMP will 
consider the need to modify the prescribing information and/or request further data from this age 
cohort. The applicant could also explore a different dose regimen (e.g. 4mg/kg TID as suggested by 
the applicant during the oral explanation). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Data from study P022 support the recommendation to use a fixed dose of the adult formulation 400 
BID when body weight is ≥ 25 kg in children aged 6 to 18 years and a weight based regimen of 
6mg/kg, to maximum dose 300 mg, twice daily, of the chewable tablets when body weight is ≥ 12 kg 
in children aged 2 to 12 years. Administration of raltegravir was allowed without regard to food intake 
during most of study P022 as no significant food effect has been detected with the various raltegravir 
formulations; hence, the SmPC states that raltegravir can be used with or without food. 
Based on the Ctrough threshold of ~45 nM, the intensive sampling data and the CV% values support the 
dosing recommendations. Further data are awaited from the applicant to prospectively assess the 
relationship between Ctrough values and viral load in younger children.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Main study  
Study 022 (P1066; IMPAACT) is an on-going Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, non-comparative 
study of approximately 140 HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 4 weeks through 18 years of age 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK parameters and efficacy of raltegravir in combination with an 
optimized background regimen.   
Study Participants  
HIV-1 infection was defined as positive results from two samples (blood, serum or plasma) collected at 
different time points and the tests that were to be used were defined in the protocol by age group. 
Eligibility for any of Cohorts I, IIA, IIB and III required that the patient had been on an unchanged 
therapeutic regimen for at least 12 weeks or were treatment experienced but had not been on 
treatment for ≥ 4 weeks prior to study entry.  
Dose adjustments for growth, formulation substitutions and substitutions within class for toxicity 
management within the prior 12 weeks were permitted. 
Subjects must have had ≤ 1 log drop in HIV RNA within 12 weeks prior to the screening visit or 
screening HIV RNA ≥ 25,000 copies/mL (with the exception of patients who had not received ARV 
therapy for ≥ 4 weeks prior to entry). HIV RNA was to be ≥ 1,000 copies/mL at the screening visit. 
Treatments 
See section 2.4.2 for details on raltegravir treatment. The content of the OBT could be changed during 
the study provided this was confined to substitution within class (rarely across class for documented 
toxicity), discontinuation of a background ARV or formulation substitutions.

Objectives 
•  Stage I: to evaluate the short term safety of raltegravir in infants, children and adolescents and to 
evaluate the steady state plasma concentration profiles and pharmacokinetic parameters of 
raltegravir in infants, children and adolescents.  
•  Stage II: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of raltegravir at the selected dose in combination 
with OBT in children and adolescents in the age groups defined by Cohort. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
P1066 was not designed or powered to demonstrate efficacy. However, efficacy measurements 
included HIV RNA, CD4 cell counts and percentages and viral resistance testing. The mode of testing 
and quantifying HIV RNA was defined in the protocol and was primarily based on testing by local CLIA-
certified (or equivalent) laboratories using the AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test (Version 1.5), 
ultrasensitive method. For all patients, blood samples for viral resistance assays were collected at 
screening and subsequently at Weeks 12, 24, 36 and 48 and at time of failure. 
Sample size 
There were no hypotheses for this study. 
Statistical methods 
The All Treated population included all enrolled patients who received any dose of raltegravir.  
The Final Dose population included patients who received only the final selected dose, whether enrolled 
in Stage I or Stage II. This population was considered the evaluable population and was used for the 
primary assessment of safety and efficacy since the data are most relevant to the intended commercial 
use.  
For each of the defined virological responses (successes), the following two approaches were used to 
handle missing values for patients who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment: 
•  Observed Failure (OF): Patients who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment due to lack of 
efficacy were considered as failures thereafter. Patients who prematurely discontinued assigned 
treatment, for reasons other than lack of efficacy, were excluded from the analyses. 
•  Non-Completer = Failure (NC=F): Patients who prematurely discontinued assigned treatment 
regardless of reasons were considered as failures thereafter. Intermittent missing values were 
assigned as failures unless immediately flanked by 2 successes. 
Definition of virological failure 
To distinguish non-response from rebound, the final definition of virological failure was as follows: 
1) never achieved ≥ 1 log drop from baseline in plasma HIV RNA or HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL 
through Week 24 
OR 
2) virological rebound at Week 24 or later defined as (a) confirmed HIV RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL 
(on 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart) after initial response with HIV RNA < 
400 copies/mL or (b) confirmed > 1.0 log 10 increase in HIV RNA above nadir level (on 2 
consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart). Nadir was defined as the lowest HIV RNA by 
the evaluated time point.

Analysis by Demographic and Prognostic Factors 
The protocol specified that logistic/linear regression model would be used to identify variables 
contributing to virological success and favourable CD4 changes. The analysis of efficacy by PK 
parameters used the average raltegravir concentration from each patient’s random PK measures as a 
covariate in predicting virological outcome at Week 24. The specific background regimen was not used 
as a prognostic factor because of the sparse use of various different regimens.

A cumulative total of 126 patients (All Treated population) were enrolled and treated in Cohorts I, IIA, 
IIB and III, as of the data cutoff of 15-Jul-2011, including 87 patients in the adult tablet formulation 
group (Cohort I and IIA) and 39 patients in the chewable tablet formulation group (Cohort IIB and III).  
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy 
P1066 was not designed or powered to demonstrate efficacy. 
Based upon the OF approach > 70% of the patients in each cohort had ≥ 1 log drop in HIV RNA or HIV 
RNA < 400 copies/mL at Week 24 except for Cohort IIA (with only 4 patients in the Final Dose 
population and a response rate of 50%).  
At Week 24 all Cohort IIB and III patients had complete data. Based on the OF approach in the final 
dose population, 76.9% (10/13) and 70% (14/20) in respective cohorts had ≥ 1 log drop from baseline 
in HIV RNA or < 400 copies/mL at Week 24 while 53.8% (7/13) and 50% (10/20) achieved < 50 
copies/mL.  Mean change from baseline in CD4 cell count was > 140 cells/mm3 for all 33 children and 
the mean change in CD4% from baseline was 3.5% (0.8% in Cohort IIB and 5.3% in Cohort III).   
AUC0-12hr and C12hr values by age and weight showed that the final dosing recommendations for each 
cohort (I, IIA, IIB, and III) resulted in consistent and acceptable (based on the protocol pre-defined 
values) estimates for AUC0-12hr and C12hr across the entire ranges of age (2 to 18 years) and weights 
(12 to 60 kg).

Table 7.  Efficacy analysis by cohort; final dose population; week 24; observed failure approach 
The results for the All Treated population were generally comparable to those for the Final Dose 
population. With more patients included in All Treated population for Cohort IIA (N=16), the viral and 
CD4 responses in this cohort were more consistent with the other cohorts.  
The Week 48 results showed a similar pattern those for Week 24. There was a slight increase in overall 
proportions with a virological response and a larger increase in CD4 cell count and CD4 percent. Again, 
the results for the All Treated patients at Week 48 were comparable to those for the Final Dose 
population. 
Table 8.  Efficacy analysis by cohort; final dose population; week 48; observed failure approach 
The results obtained when the NC=F approach was used in the Final Dose and All Treated populations 
were generally comparable to those observed using the primary OF missing data approach. 
From Week 4 onwards over 80% of patients in each cohort achieved ≥ 1 log10 drop from baseline in 
HIV RNA or HIV RNA < 400 copies/mL. Between Weeks 12 and 24 there were small drops in 
percentages meeting the primary virological response criteria. Patients in Cohorts I, IIB and III 
achieved similar virological suppression over time with sustained responses up to Weeks 24 and 48. At 
Week 80, the success rate for Cohort I patients was > 60%. Cohort IIA (N=4) had a response rate 
comparable to other cohorts through Week 12 but by Week 24 two experienced an increase in HIV RNA 
although another regained suppression by Week 48. The data were also shown separately for those 
with < 400 copies/mL over time, with a similar pattern observed. 
At Week 8, 59% of all patients achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies/mL. Sustained responses were observed 
until Week 24 for each cohort and up to Week 48 for Cohorts I, IIA and IIB. At Week 80 45% of Cohort 
I patients had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL. 
Isentress Assessment report

In the All Treated population 25 patients across all cohorts failed by Week 24 and 34 patients failed by 
Week 48. Most failures involved rebound and there were very few non-responders. Most failures that 
occurred between Weeks 24 and 48 (7/9) were in Cohort I. 
Treatment adherence 
In cohort IIB, 33.3% of patients were 100% compliant, 11.1% of patients were 99 to 90% compliant 
and 22.2% of patients were 89 to 80% compliant. In cohort III, 33.3% of patients were 100% 
compliant, 42.9% of patients were 99 to 90% compliant and 14.3% of patients were 89 to 80% 
compliant (all treated population; DLP 14/02/11). One patient in Cohort IIB was reported to have 
discontinued due to intolerance. No patient in Cohort III discontinued the chewable tablet due to 
palatability issues. However, it should be noted that treatment adherence data were not reliable as 
these were not available for every patient or every time point during the treatment period. 
No clear relationship was detected between adherence and failure but again this result may be 
unreliable due to the considerable amount of missing data on pill counts.  
Resistance 
Of the 34 All Treated patients with virological failure 18 (53%) had at least 1 BLOQ PK sample and 10 
(29%) had ≥ 2 BLOQ PK samples. However, none of the patients in the Final Dose population that 
failed and had a virus showing acquired resistance had BLOQ PK samples. 
Patients had not been exposed to raltegravir or an experimental integrase inhibitor prior to enrolment. 
Viruses isolated in screening visit samples from patients who ultimately failed included: one with T97A 
that was phenotypically sensitive, two with L741, both phenotypically sensitive, one with I203 M that 
was phenotypically sensitive. All other baseline viruses either showed no known raltegravir RAMs or 
the results are not available.  
Of the 31 All Treated patients who failed and had any genotypic data available, viruses obtained at the 
time of failure from 10 (32.3%) displayed signature resistance mutations as shown below.  
Table 9.  Number (%) of virologic failure patients with HIV integrase mutations at amino acids 143, 
148 and/or 155 by cohort; all treated population; weeks 0-48

Page 32/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two of the 21 virological failures whose viruses did not display a primary raltegravir resistance 
mutation at the time of failure had viruses containing other known raltegravir resistance mutations. 
Among the All Treated patients who failed by Week 48, there were 26 patients with both baseline and 
post-baseline phenotypic resistance data. Viruses from these patients at baseline showed phenotypic 
susceptibility. Viruses obtained after virological failure showed mean and median fold-changes in IC50 
of 33.8 and 1.0 (range 0.6 to 150.2), respectively.  
Virological response rates were broadly consistent across race, ethnicity, baseline HIV RNA category, 
baseline CD4 cell count category, viral subtype and number of classes of ARV drugs previously 
exposed. The response rate for male patients was 22.6% higher than that for females and response 
rates for patients with fewer than 2 active drugs in their OBT based on PSS and GSS were higher (by 
20.6% and 29.2%, respectively) than those with 2 or more active drugs in OBT. The response rate was 
slightly higher in those with higher viral load at baseline and for non-clade B virus. However, it should 
be noted that the number analysed are relatively small.  
GSS / PSS 
Analyses using the univariate logistic regression model showed that gender and GSS had significant 
associations with the virological response. The PSS effect was in the same direction as the GSS effect 
but was not as strong. This model did not control for confounding of associations by other covariates.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has broadly complied with the advice given on paediatric development in the CHMP 
guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (Doc. 
Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The changes in CD4 cell counts and percentages over time demonstrated comparable patterns across 
the cohorts except for Cohort IIA, which had large variability due to the small sample size. The results 
for the All Treated population were comparable to those for the Final Dose population. Change from 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 34/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline in HIV RNA at Week 24 and virological success at Week 24 were significantly correlated with 
Week 24 CD4 cell count change.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose 
regimens and the expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an 
extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  
As per the above, Study P022 has been designed accordingly and therefore efficacy wasn’t a primary 
endpoint. The numbers per cohort and in the various sub-groups of interest are too small to draw 
definite conclusions, but taking into account the overall virological and immunological response rates in 
study P022 which were satisfactory, the CHMP concludes that the extrapolation was appropriate to the 
paediatric population covered by the proposed indication.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All patients who received at least one dose of raltegravir in study 022 were included in the evaluation 
of safety. Patients who switched raltegravir formulations during the study were included with their 
originally assigned age cohort and formulation for safety reporting.  
• 
• 
• 
The mean number of days (range) for Final Dose patients on any dose of raltegravir was 565 (28 
to 1112) days. The mean number of days (range) for All Treated patients on raltegravir at any 
dose was 626 (28 to 1246) days. 
The mean number of days (range) for Cohort I and IIA (tablet) Final Dose patients on raltegravir 
tablets at 400 mg BID was 657 (28 to 1112) days. Over 40 patients in Cohort I had received 
raltegravir for more than 96 weeks by the cut-off date for the CSR. 
The mean number of days on raltegravir for Cohorts IIB and III (chewable tablet) was 351 (179 to 
604) days. Total daily doses were weight-based and ranged from 75 to 300 mg twice daily. 
Adverse events  
Final Dose, Weeks 0–24 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 35/45 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 11.  Summary of clinical AE by cohort; final dose population; weeks 0-24 
The most frequently reported AEs were cough (32.3%), pyrexia (24%) and rhinorrhoea (18.8%). The 
profile of AEs for All Treated patients was generally similar to that for Final Dose patients.  
The most frequently reported AEs of Grade 3 or greater were various pneumonias [7.3% Final Dose 
patients; including bronchopneumonia (1), lobar pneumonia (1), pneumonia (3), pneumococcal 
pneumonia (1) and RSV pneumonia (1)], pyrexia (2.1%), gastroenteritis (2.1%) and suicidal 
behaviour (2.1%). Only three Grade 3 or greater AEs (in one patient) were considered drug-related 
(events of abnormal behaviour, psychomotor hyperactivity and insomnia).  
Final Dose, Weeks 0–48 
Clinical AEs (Grades 1–4) were reported by 85.4% of Final Dose patients up to Week 48. The profile of 
clinical adverse events at Week 48 was generally similar to that at Week 24 for Final Dose patients. 
The most frequently reported were cough (42.7%), pyrexia (32.3%), and rhinorrhoea (27.1%).

Grade 3 or greater clinical AEs were reported by 15.6% of patients and 10.4% reported Grade 3 or 
greater AEs that mapped to the Infections and Infestations SOC. Additional AEs reported between 
Weeks 24 and 48 included bacterial pneumonia, abdominal pain, iron deficiency anaemia, decreased 
weight, failure to thrive, bacterial sepsis, convulsion, reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy 
syndrome, erythema, conjunctival hyperaemia, periorbital cellulitis and influenza-like illness. 
AEs of special interest 
The applicant’s database was explored for a series of pre-defined AEs of special interest based on what 
is known about raltegravir and also other ARTs. Some highlighted cases include AEs of rash (none of 
these events was reported as Grade 3 or 4 or serious) and psychiatric disorders (by week 48 of the 
study, 10.4% of final dose patients reported psychiatric disorders including one reported Grade 3 AEs 
considered possibly related to raltegravir by the investigator).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One patient in the All Treated population had a SAE of pneumonia resulting in death by the data cut-off 
date. The investigator determined that Grade 5 bilateral pneumonia was not related to study 
raltegravir 
By Week 24, 13 Final Dose patients had reported 16 SAEs including pyrexia, acute renal failure, 
metrorrhagia, pneumonia (7 events), infection, asthma, suicidal behaviour (2 events), respiratory tract 
infection and allergic dermatitis. Also, there was one SAE of depression in an All Treated patient. The 
category with the highest frequency of SAEs was Infections and Infestations (9 patients [9.4%]), all in 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 38/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cohort I. The only SAE considered related to study raltegravir by the investigator was the case of 
allergic dermatitis.  
At Week 48 there had been 21 SAEs reported by 14 (14.6%) patients in the Final Dose population. The 
5 additional SAEs that occurred between Weeks 24 and 48 included pneumonia, failure to thrive, 
convulsion, anaemia and periorbital cellulitis. These events were not considered related to study 
raltegravir by the investigator. There were no additional reports of SAEs by All Treated patients 
between Weeks 24 and 48. Between Week 48 and the data cut-off date, there were 11 additional SAEs 
including pain in extremity, pneumonia, oesophagitis, anaemia (3 events for the same patient), 
cachexia, pyrexia, Mycobacterium Avium complex infection, bacterial pneumonia and respiratory 
distress. These events were not considered related to study raltegravir by the investigators. Three 
additional All Treated patients reported SAEs after Week 48 and all events were considered not related 
to study raltegravir by the investigators.  
There were three pregnancies reported of which one resulted in intra-uterine fetal death not 
considered to be treatment-related. 
Laboratory findings 
Final Dose, Weeks 0–24 
Laboratory AEs were reported by 75% of Final Dose patients. Most were Grade 1 and 2. The most 
frequently reported included decreased neutrophil count (21% [20/96]), which ranged from Grades 1 
to 4, decreased non-fasting blood glucose (20% [19/96]), which were primarily Grade 1, and 
decreased blood sodium (18% [17/96]), which were primarily Grade 1 events. There were two 
laboratory SAEs of which one was considered drug-related by the investigator. Grade 3 or greater 
laboratory AEs were reported in 13.5% of which one patient in Cohort III had AEs considered to be 
drug-related (increased ALT and AST; see below).  
Final Dose, Weeks 0-48 
Laboratory AEs were reported by 84.4% of Final Dose patients. Most laboratory AEs were Grades 1 and 
2 and the most frequently reported were similar to those observed at Week 24. Additional Grade 3 or 
greater laboratory AEs reported by Final Dose patients between Weeks 24 and 48 included decreased 
haemoglobin, increased blood glucose, increased blood bilirubin, increased ALT (5 events) and 
increased AST (8 events). The most frequently reported event was decreased neutrophil count (8.3%).   
Three All Treated patients reported Grade 3 or greater laboratory adverse events considered possibly 
drug-related by the investigator. One patient in Cohort IIB had increased low density lipoprotein by 
Week 24. One in Cohort I had decreased neutrophil count by Week 24 and one on Cohort IIA had 
drug-related decreased neutrophil count (2 events, both possibly related) by Week 48.  
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
There were two Final Dose patients who had a Grade 3 or greater serum ALT increase that represented 
a worsening from baseline. One considered possibly related to study raltegravir and one considered not 
related to raltegravir by the investigators. 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
One patient in Cohort IIB reported increased AST (highest report: Grade 4) that was considered not 
related to study raltegravir by the investigator.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patients from the Final Dose or All Treated population discontinued due to a clinical or laboratory AE 
up to the data cut-off date. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data do not give rise to any new or major concerns. In particular, the choice of Final Dose 
was not in any way limited by issues of safety when administered as either the adult tablet or 
chewable tablet formulation in combination with OBR.  
All the adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial have been included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.  
In the view of the safety profile of the chewable tablets, the CHMP considers that the PSUR cycle of 
this medicinal product should remain unchanged. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new safety findings in the 
paediatric population in comparison to the adult population. In addition, no specific safety concerns in 
the paediatric population were identified in the data submitted with the present application. Therefore, 
the CHMP concludes that the safety profile of raltegravir in the proposed indication is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
No update of the pharmacovigilance system was submitted with the present application. 
Risk Management Plan 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan, which included an update of the existing risk 
minimisation plan to reflect the extension of the marketing authorisation to children from 2 to 18 years 
and the new chewable tablets. The risk management plan was reviewed and agreed by the CHMP.  
Given the limited number of patients enrolled in the paediatric 022, the CHMP requested the applicant 
to collect additional data in children aged 2 to <6 years to provide further data on the adequacy of the 
recommended posology with particular reference to the threshold value of Ctrough ~ 45nM.  
Since the start of the procedure, the applicant has submitted an updated version of the RMP (v9, 17 
August 2012) with the procedure (EMEA/H/C/860/II/37) which included the changes related to the 
present application. 
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for the 25mg chewable 
tablets has been performed on the basis of a bridging report making reference to the 100mg chewable 
tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Raltegravir has been shown to be effective in adults. However, the in-vitro and in-vivo data have 
clearly underlined the importance of administering it as part of a total ART regimen that preferably 
includes at least two other agents predicted to be active.  
In line with the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), based on the identification of suitable dose 
regimens and the expectation that PK/PD relationships are the same in children as in adults, an 
extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children may be accepted.  
Data from study 022 lead to recommendation to use a fixed dose of the adult formulation 400 BID 
when body weight is ≥ 25 kg in children aged 6 to 18 years and a weight based regimen of 6mg/kg, to 
maximum dose 300 mg, twice daily, of the chewable tablets when body weight is ≥ 12 kg in children 
aged 2 to 12 years. These dose recommendations were considered adequate by the CHMP.  
Based on the Ctrough threshold of ~45 nM, the CHMP was of the opinion that the intensive sampling 
data and the CV% values from study P022 support these dosing recommendations. Indeed, based on 
the Ctrough threshold of ~45 nM, the intensive sampling data and the CV% values support the dosing 
recommendations, regardless of the fact that GM Ctrough derived from intensive sampling drifts 
downwards with decreasing age. The individual numbers with Ctrough < 45 nM were 0-2 per age 
group/dose cohort. Focusing on the Ctrough comparisons, neither the intensive nor the (calculation-
corrected) sparse sampling Ctrough suggest that there would be a risk of values below 33 (or even 45) 
nM when using the chewable tablets in children aged 2 to <6 years of age compared with other age 
group / dose Cohort. 
Study P022 has been designed in line with the recommendations of the CHMP guideline on the clinical 
development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV infection (Doc. Ref. 
EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02). Therefore efficacy wasn’t a primary endpoint; however, the overall 
virological and immunological response rates in study P022 were satisfactory.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Despite the supportive PK/PD data and the overall good virological and immunological response rates, 
this design of study P022 presents some limitations (i.e. open label trial, small number of patients 
enrolled, etc…).  
The Committee was of the opinion that these limitations are inherent to the settings of this PK study 
and the provision of limited data in paediatric cohorts is considered acceptable for an antiretroviral 
agent that has been shown to be efficacious in adults as it is the case for raltegravir.  
However, given the limited number of patients enrolled in this paediatric study, the CHMP requested 
that the applicant collects additional information in children aged 2 to <6 years of age to provide 
further data on the adequacy of the recommended posology with particular reference to the threshold 
value of Ctrough ~ 45nM.  
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 41/45 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new safety findings in the 
paediatric population in comparison to the adult population. In addition, no specific safety concerns in 
the paediatric population were identified in the data submitted with the present application. Therefore, 
the CHMP concludes that the safety profile of raltegravir in the proposed indication is acceptable. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Despite the overall safety profile similar to adults and the absence of new findings specific to the 
paediatric population, the sample size was expectedly too small to draw definite conclusions.       
Benefit-risk balance 
As stated in the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/633/02), provided that reliable pharmacokinetic data 
support robust dose recommendations, an extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults to children 
may be accepted.  
Data from study 022 supports the use of a fixed dose of the adult formulation 400 BID when body 
weight is ≥ 25 kg in children aged 6 to 18 years and a weight based regimen of 6mg/kg, to maximum 
dose 300 mg, twice daily, of the chewable tablets when body weight is ≥ 12 kg in children aged 2 to 
12 years.  
Based on the Ctrough threshold of ~45 nM, the intensive sampling data and the CV% values from study 
P022 support these dosing recommendations.  
Therefore, the CHMP concludes that extrapolation from adult to the paediatric population covered by 
the proposed indication is acceptable.  
This is supported by the overall satisfactory virological and immunological response rates in Study 
P022.  
In addition, the safety data in the claimed paediatric indication do not give rise to any new safety 
findings in the paediatric population in comparison to the adult population. No specific safety concerns 
in the paediatric population were identified in the data submitted with the present application. 
As a consequence, the CHMP concluded that the benefit /risk balance is favourable for use of 
raltegravir with a fixed dose of the adult formulation 400 BID when body weight is ≥ 25 kg in children 
aged 6 to 18 years and a weight based regimen of 6mg/kg, to maximum dose 300 mg, twice daily, of 
the chewable tablets when body weight is ≥ 12 kg in children aged 2 to 12 years. 
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority that 
the risk/benefit balance of the extension of Marketing Authorisation for Isentress chewable tablets 25 
mg and 100 mg in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral 
Isentress Assessment report  
Page 42/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy (ART)-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 2 years is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the current conditions below.  
In addition, the CHMP considers by consensus the following variation acceptable and recommends the 
variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following change: 
Variations requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

5. Appendix 
Divergent Positions 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the variation 
of the marketing authorisation of Isentress.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Balancing the benefit of raltegravir as a treatment alternative in very small children, and the risks 
related to uncertainties about adequate drug exposure, we do not consider that the chewable tablet 
regimen for patients aged 2-6 years is approvable. The data on C12h and AUC from detailed and sparse 
sampling suggest that the recommended posology could result in inadequate exposures to raltegravir 
compared to adults. 
Failure with a raltegravir-based regimen is very often accompanied by high level raltegravir resistance, 
as well as resistance to cytidine analogues. The consequences of virological failure due to suboptimal 
dosing in small children, in terms of remaining treatment options, would be of considerable relevance.  
From ages 6 years and upwards the adult formulation can be used.

Introduction 
On March 28:th, 2017 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study (CIGE025A2425) for Xolair, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study  CIGE025A2425  was  a  randomized,  open  label,  parallel-group,  international,  multicenter  study 
evaluating  persistency  of  response  to  omalizumab  during  32  weeks  treatment  given  as  add  on  to 
optimized asthma therapy in adult and adolescent patients with severe persistent allergic asthma, who 
remain inadequately controlled despite Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA (2004)) step 4 therapy. 
This  study  was  conducted  in  fourteen  countries  (Belgium,  Canada,  Denmark,  Germany,  Hungary, 
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and UK) and randomized a 
total of 404 male and female patients aged 14 to 73 years. 
A short critical expert overview written by a Novartis employee has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that CIGE025A2425 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study  
Xolair, as approved was used in this study.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study CIGE025A2425 (last patient last visit on 23-Sep-2008) 
It is noted that the time period between the last patient last visit in the study CIGE025A2425 and the 
finalisation of the current report is more than eight years. 
1.3.2.  Clinical study 
CIGE025A2425  
Methods 
Objective 
Primary objective: To evaluate persistency in treatment responder classification between assessments 
at 16 and 32 weeks after starting omalizumab therapy given as add on to optimized asthma therapy in 
patients who remained uncontrolled despite GINA (2004) Step 4 therapy. Treatment response was 
defined by at least marked improvement of overall asthma control as assessed by physician Global 
Evaluation of Treatment Effectiveness (GETE).

Study design 
This was an international multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group study, measuring 
treatment effect persistency during 32 weeks treatment with omalizumab administered in conjunction 
with optimized asthma therapy (OAT). 
Study population /Sample size 
Patients entered into this study were 12 - 75 years old diagnosed with allergic asthma who continued 
to be inadequately controlled despite treatment with high doses of ICS and LABA. 
A total of 404 patients were randomized (2:1) to 32 weeks treatment of omalizumab in addition to OAT 
or remained on their OAT (273 patients to omalizumab + OAT, 131 patients to OAT).  
In the age group 12 to <18 years, five patients were randomized (five patients to omalizumab + OAT, 
no patient to OAT). One out of five patients who was allocated to omalizumab + OAT arm was 
discontinued from the study due to protocol deviation (0140/00009: Enrollment of pregnant female). 
As per inclusion criteria, no patients aged 6 to < 12 years were enrolled into the study. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
In the patient group aged 12 to <18 years, no separate efficacy analysis in these patients was 
performed due to the small number of patients (five patients). 
Safety results 
Due to the small number of patients (five patients) aged 12 to <18 years included in Study 
CIGE025A2425, no separate safety analysis in these patients group was performed.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Elevation of the plasma potassium concentration decreases the ratio of intracellular to extracellular 
potassium, leading to partial depolarization of the cell membrane. These physiological effects of 
hyperkalaemia can result in muscle weakness, paralysis, life-threatening effects on cardiac conduction 
(e.g., QRS widening), arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Thus, hyperkalaemia 
represents a serious condition that can result in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and is associated 
with increased mortality risk. While rare in the healthy individuals with normal renal function, the 
prevalence of hyperkalaemia in patients with renal insufficiency or chronic kidney disease (CKD) ranges 
from 5% to 50% and increases as renal function declines. Thus, patients most at risk of hyperkalaemia 
are those with compromised renal excretion of potassium, primarily patients with CKD and/or patients 
being treated with drugs that inhibit renal potassium excretion, including renin angiotensin aldosterone 
system inhibitors (RAASi). RAASi are used in the treatment of hypertension, CKD and congestive heart 
failure and compelling data and clinical practice guidelines support the use of RAASi to reduce adverse 
cardiovascular and renal outcomes in certain high-risk patient populations However, therapy with RAASi 
can be limited by hyperkalaemia resulting from treatment with these medications. In addition to CKD and 
the use of RAASi, diabetes and the use of beta-blockers can increase the risk of hyperkalaemia leading to 
fatal cardiac arrhythmias. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Based upon 2015 population estimates of 508 million persons in the European Union (EU) and 320 million 
in the US, it is estimated that 3.8 million patients will present with hyperkalaemia each year in the EU and 
approximately 2.4 million patients in the US. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Potassium balance is regulated in part by secretion of potassium into the colon through a passive 
paracellular route and active secretion. Hence in the colon, potassium is at high concentration relative to 
other cations. In CKD, urinary excretion of potassium decreases and colonic secretion of potassium 
increases substantially. Hyperkalaemia can present as a consequence of a number of acute clinical 
conditions that occur in a hospital setting. Based on literature data, approximately 14% of patients 
experienced a hyperkaliaemic event and the rate was higher in patients with CKD than in those without 
CKD. Acute clinical conditions such as tumour lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, crush injuries, massive 
blood transfusions and acute renal failure can each lead to a rise in serum potassium to high levels. These 
acute clinical conditions require immediate treatment for the hyperkalaemia, particularly when the 
degree of hyperkalaemia is severe (e.g., serum potassium ≥  6.5 mEq/L) and/or associated with cardiac 
repolarization disturbances. The risk of death is increased significantly in CKD patients with 
hyperkalaemia, underscoring the need to treat this clinical condition.

2.1.4.  Management 
The approach to managing patients with acute hyperkalaemia due to reversible underlying conditions 
differs somewhat from the approach to managing patients whose underlying conditions contributing to 
hyperkalaemia are more persistent and chronic in nature. Patients with severe acute hyperkalaemia, or 
with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes related to hyperkalaemia, are generally already hospitalized or 
sent to the hospital for treatment. The therapeutic goals in such hospitalized patients with severe 
hyperkalaemia are: temporarily stabilisation of the myocardium, temporarily shift in intracellular 
potassium and utilisation of treatments that remove potassium from the body, which are intended to 
reduce the risk for developing a fatal cardiac arrhythmic event. For patients in whom the aetiology of 
hyperkalaemia is not reversible but rather more chronic in nature from underlying CKD and/or use of 
RAASi therapies, the traditional approach to management has relied on dietary potassium restriction, 
RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation, diuretics, oral bicarbonate and if applicable, the use of the cation 
exchange resins sodium polystyrene sulfonate or calcium polystyrene sulfonate. The use of dietary 
potassium restriction to manage hyperkalaemia is difficult due to the ubiquitous presence of potassium in 
foods.  
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate are two cation-exchange resins 
currently approved in the EU for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. They were introduced in the 1950s and 
1960s; however, have not been rigorously studied. There are limited prospective, long-term clinical trial 
data available to understand the safety and efficacy of these agents. These products are not well tolerated 
and their use can be associated with life-threatening side effects including intestinal necrosis. Further, an 
appreciable sodium load can occur with sodium polystyrene sulfonate such that caution is advised when 
sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered to patients who cannot tolerate even a small increase in 
sodium loads. These issues make the administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for prolonged 
durations of time difficult. Additionally, calcium and sodium polystyrene sulfonate are contraindicated for 
treating patients with a serum potassium < 5.0 mEq/L and both require frequent stop and start cycles of 
drug administration, further complicating chronic dosing. Thus, there is a need for new therapeutics for 
hyperkalaemia whose efficacy and safety are well characterized and can be administered long term. 
About the product 
Veltassa, powder for oral suspension, contains a new chemical entity (RLY5016S) belonging to the 
pharmacologic class of potassium binders.  The active moiety, patiromer, is a non-absorbed, 
cation-exchange polymer that binds potassium predominantly in the lumen of the colon where potassium 
is the most abundant cation.  This increases faecal potassium excretion, leading to removal of potassium 
from the body and lowering of serum potassium levels in hyperkaliaemic patients. 
The applied for indication of Veltassa is treatment of hyperkalaemia in adult patients. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for oral suspension containing 8.4 g, 16.8 g or 25.2 g of 
patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium) as active substance.  
The other ingredient of the product is xanthan gum.  
Veltassa is a non-absorbed cation exchange polymer manufactured as free-flowing spherical beads of 
approximately 100 micrometer diameter which are taken orally.  The beads are of a size that is not

absorbed.  It increases faecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the 
gastrointestinal tract.  Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the 
gastrointestinal lumen resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels. 
The product is available in sachets made of five layers: polyethylene, aluminium, polyethylene, polyester 
and paper as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance, patiromer sorbitex calcium (RLY5016S), is a crosslinked polymer anion of 
patiromer (RLY5016H) with calcium-sorbitol counterion. The chemical name of patiromer sorbitex 
calcium is poly[(D-glucitol-calcium) 2-fluoroacrylate-co-diethenylbenzene-co-octa-1,7-diene] 
corresponding to the molecular formula (Ca2C6H14O6)m(C3H2FO2)4m(C10H10)4n(C8H14)4p.   The active 
substance contains approximately 15% water. The structure of patiromer sorbitex calcium is shown in 
Figure 1. No regular order of the monomers is implied by the structure; crosslinking is expected to occur 
randomly along the polymer chains. 
Figure 1. Structure of patiromer sorbitex calcium. 
The chemical structure of the patiromer sorbitex calcium comprises three repeating units: a negatively 
charged 2-fluoro-2-propenoate and two difunctional molecules (divinylbenzene and 1,7-octadiene) that 
crosslink the polymer. As mentioned above, calcium-sorbitol complex is the counter-ion to the negatively 
charged and cross-linked polymer anion.  
The structure of the active substance was investigated using FTIR spectroscopy, solid-state 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) spectroscopy, elemental analysis for fluorine by oxygen combustion and 
ion selective electrode (ISE), elemental analysis for calcium by ion chromatography (IC), analysis of 
sorbitol content by liquid chromatography with refractive index detection (LC-RI), determination of water 
content from loss on drying by gravimetry, and patiromer anion content by calculation. The 
calcium-sorbitol complex, which is the counterion to the negatively changed polymer anion, was 
characterised by 43Ca-NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the equilibrium binding of sorbitol to the patiromer 
calcium salt form of the polymer (RLY5016), and a comparison of the stabilizing effect of sorbitol were 
provided as evidence of the calcium-sorbitol counterion complex.

Patiromer sorbitex calcium is an amorphous, free flowing yellow-brown non-hygroscopic powder 
composed of individual spherical beads. Each crosslinked polymer bead represents one macromolecule 
that has multiple covalent crosslinks between polymer chains. The weight of a bead is dependent on its 
size and patiromer sorbitex calcium exhibits a distribution in particle size, which is controlled in the active 
substance specification (see specifications section). The molecular weight for a 100 micrometer bead was 
estimated to be 5.6 × 1017 g/mol.  
The active substance is insoluble in water, 0.1 M HCl, methanol and n-heptane. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The applicant has described the manufacture of the active substance,  along with its control of materials, 
critical steps, in-process control and process validation.   
Patiromer sorbitex calcium is manufactured in two main steps (suspension polymerization and post 
polymerisation processing) using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications . 
During the evaluation there was a major objection regarding the potential absorption and accumulation of 
the polymer beads. It was clarified that in order to overcome the risk of absorption of small particles and 
ensure these are not formed, the active substance manufacturing process was designed to manufacture 
polymer beads with an adequate diameter and a narrow particle size distribution. The main steps to 
achieve this objective and to avoid the formation of particles smaller than 1 μm, which may be absorbed, 
were adequately described. 
The absence of small particles is ensured by the manufacturing process. In addition, the respective 
particle size distribution is controlled by tight specifications. 
To demonstrate that the RLY5016 polymer is not systemically absorbed after oral administration and is 
excreted in the faeces, two single-dose absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) 
studies with radiolabelled RLY5016 were performed in rats and dogs. Plasma, faecal and urinary 
monitoring from both studies demonstrated the non-absorbed nature of the polymer and its lack of 
systemic bioavailability. 
Process control for the manufacture of patiromer sorbitex calcium is achieved through specifications of 
the input materials and intermediates, in-process controls (IPCs) and established process hold points. 
There was an extensive investigation of process parameters and associated ranges to ensure a robust 
process that produces active substance which consistently meets the quality criteria.  
The applicant has provided a large amount of manufacturing development data including a discussion of 
quality target product profile, quality risk assessments to establish critical quality attributes and critical 
process parameters as determined using design of experiments and edge of failure experiments.  The 
manufacturer has then outlined ranges of process parameters which are proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs). No design space has been defined. The available development data, the proposed control 
strategy and batch analysis data fully support the proposed PARs.  
The critical quality attributes for patiromer sorbitex calcium are: calcium content, patiromer anion 
content, sorbitol content, total potassium exchange capacity, particle size distribution, loss on drying, 
impurities and fluoride. The critical process parameters have been adequately described. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. In addition, carryover, spiking and depletion studies have been carried out 
on impurities.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program.  The differences between the different manufacturing process used during 
development and the process registered for each manufacturing site have been adequately explained. 
The manufacturing process development for RLY5016S was carried out in three development stages: 
The first stage was the early development stage where the RLY5016 polymeric structure was developed 
with the desired potassium binding characteristics. At this stage of development, RLY5016, the calcium 
salt form of the polymer, was produced as the active substance.  
In the second stage of development, sorbitol was introduced into the polymer to yield the calcium-sorbitol 
counterion, resulting in a more stable form of the drug substance, RLY5016S, by minimizing degradation. 
In the third stage of development, the commercial process with enhanced control strategies and improved 
process robustness was developed. 
A comparability assessment to evaluate the equivalence of active substance manufactured by the 
different manufacturing sites was conducted. The assessment involved comparison of manufacturing 
processes, batch analysis data, impurity profiles, physicochemical characterization, and stability trends. 
The comparison of process elements resulted in the conclusion that the minor differences between the 
processes used at the different sites had no impact on the active substance quality.  
The active substance is packaged in a low density polyethylene (LDPE) bag, which in turn is placed into a 
second outer LDPE bag. The sealed, double-bagged active substance is enclosed in a drum. The LDPE 
bags used as the primary container meet the requirements set forth in the Ph.Eur. monograph 3.1.3. 
Polyolefines  and  the  EU  Directive  10/2011  and  its  amendments  for  plastics  with  food  contact.  The 
differences  in  container  closure  system  between  sites  are  not  considered  significant  and  their  use  is 
justified by stability data. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for    appearance,  identity  (FTIR,  fluorine  content  by 
oxygen combustion/F-ISE, calcium by IC), calcium content (IC), patiromer anion content (calculation), 
sorbitol  content  (LC-RI),  total  potassium  exchange  capacity  (IC),  rate  of  potassium  exchange  (IC), 
particle  size  distribution  (laser  diffraction),  loss  on  drying  (gravimetry),  swelling  index  (gravimetry), 
residual  solvents  (HS-GC-FID),  unspecified  impurities  (HS-GC-FID),  related  substances  (SEC-RI), 
process impurities (IC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), fluoride (F-ISE), microbial enumeration tests (Ph. 
Eur) and specified microorganisms (Ph. Eur). 
Methods have been satisfactorily validated. 
Adequate toxicological data have been provided to support the proposed limits for relevant  impurities. 
Elemental impurities are controlled in accordance with the recommendations of ICH Q3D guideline. .  
Limits were based on batch analysis and are well within limits established toxicologically. 
The microbiological testing limits are based on Ph. Eur. 5.1.4 requirements for non-sterile dosage forms 
and are accepted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented.  
Batch analysis data on up to 30 pilot and up to 7 commercial scale batches of the active substance from 
the proposed manufacturing sites are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch.

Stability 
Stability data on three pilot scale stability batches of active substance manufactured at each of the 
proposed manufacturing sites, packaged in a container closure system representative of that intended for 
the market and stored for 36 months under long term conditions at 2-8 ºC and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested on the pilot scale batches: appearance, total % calcium, patiromer 
anion content, sorbitol content, potassium binding capacity, particle size distribution, loss on drying, 
residual starting materials, residual solvents, extractable impurities, total unspecified impurities, fluoride, 
swelling, total potassium exchange capacity (TKEC), total aerobic microbial counts, total combined yeast 
and molds Salmonella, Escherichia coli Staphiloccoccus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
Additional stability data from the first three commercial scale batches from each manufacturer stored at 
long term (2-8 ºC) conditions for up to 9 months and accelerated conditions for 6 months were provided. 
The following parameters were tested on the commercial scale batches: appearance, loss on drying, 
extractable polymeric impurities, largest single unspecified impurity, total unspecified impurities, 
fluoride, total potassium exchange capacity, total aerobic microbial counts, total combined yeast and 
molds and E.coli. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All parameters remained constant or within the analytical method variability over the duration of the 
stability study and met the acceptance criteria with the exception of fluoride, which exceeded the 
acceptance criteria after storage under accelerated conditions.  
A forced degradation study and a photostability study (per ICH Q1B) were conducted on three pilot scale 
batches. Samples were exposed to acid , base, thermal, and oxidative stress. Samples exposed to all the 
stress conditions were analyzed for sorbitol content, total potassium exchange capacity, fluoride content, 
methanol, individual unspecified impurities and extractable polymeric impurities. Appearance was tested 
after exposure of the active substance to the thermal stress condition only.  
The results of the forced degradation study demonstrated that exposure to acid, base, oxidative and 
thermal stress did not significantly impact the parameters tested except of fluoride. Fluoride was the only 
degradant obtained in significant amounts, as expected, upon exposure of the active substance to 
thermal stress conditions. However, the exposure to acid, base and oxidative stress resulted in minimal 
change in fluoride. 
The photostability testing demonstrated that the active substance shows some photosensitivity upon 
exposure to ICH Q1B, Section 1B Option 2 conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product, Veltassa, is a powder for oral suspension intended to be administered orally after 
suspending in water, apple juice or cranberry juice.  The product is available in single dose sachets made 
from five layer (Paper/Polyester/PE/Aluminium Foil/PE) laminate web stock that is heat sealed on four 
sides.   
Assessment report

The active substance is designed to bind potassium in the lumen of the colon.  The product is available in 
three strengths containing 8.4 g, 16.8 g and 25.2 g of patiromer (as patiromer sorbitex calcium). 
As indicated above, the active substance, patiromer sorbitex calcium, is an amorphous, free-flowing 
powder that is composed of individual spherical beads.  The particle size distribution of the active 
substance is controlled to ensure consistent product manufacturability and finished product with the 
desired quality attributes.  It was confirmed that the particle size is large enough to prevent absorption 
via transcellular or paracellular routes through intestinal epithelial cells.   
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was to develop a safe and efficacious powder for suspension 
formulation that required a minimum quantity of diluent for suspension.  The formulation was designed to 
contain a minimal number and amount of excipients to keep the total amount of powder per dose and 
volume of diluent necessary for suspension of the polymer as low as possible.  A suspending agent is the 
only excipient included in the formulation. 
Throughout development different formulations were used in clinical studies.  The commercial 
formulation is composed of patiromer sorbitex calcium and xanthan gum, used as suspending agent 
which ensures that the finished product remains suspended upon the addition of water or juices (when 
prepared as directed). Xanthan gum is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
To prove the suitability of potential excipients for the preparation of dosage forms, excipient compatibility 
studies were performed on binary mixtures of active substance and excipients No relevant interaction 
between any excipient and the active substance was observed. These results support the acceptability of 
all the excipients used during clinical studies and the intended commercial formulation. 
The formulations evaluated during development provide a suspension upon mixing with a small amount 
of water.   
In this regard, a suspendability and pourability experiment was conducted to determine the quantity of 
water for suspension of the finished product.  The results from these studies demonstrate that all dosage 
strengths can be suspended in 80 ml of water, apple or cranberry juice to yield a suspension that can be 
administered. The preparation instructions are described in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the finished product is compatible with water, apple juice or 
cranberry juice. The studies demonstrated that the finished product can be suspended in water, apple 
juice or cranberry juice without adversely impacting the quality of the suspension achieved or the binding 
capacity and stability of patiromer.   
As mentioned above, patiromer sorbitex calcium is a cross-linked polymer that does not require systemic 
absorption for its therapeutic or pharmacologic effect.  The polymer remains intact in the gastrointestinal 
tract where it exerts its potassium binding effect. 
The total activity of Veltassa is determined by in vitro potassium exchange.  The total potassium exchange 
capacity (TKEC) assay measures the total binding sites of the active substance in the finished product.  
This test is performed as a finished product batch release and stability test.  
The primary packaging consists of sachets made of five layers: polyethylene, aluminium, polyethylene, 
polyester and paper. The sachet is opaque, provides protection against light and ingress of water and is 
compatible with the drug product. The product contact surface (polyethylene layer) of the sachet is 
suitable for food contact.  The manufacturer of the sachet has declared that all constituents are listed in 
Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact 
with food and all its amendments. He has also declared that the polyethylene layer (the product contact 
surface) meets the requirements of European Pharmacopoeia 3.1.3 "Polyolefins" materials used for the 
manufacture of containers and the requirements of European Pharmacopoeia 3.1.4 "Polyethylene without

additives for Containers for Parenteral Preparations and for Ophthalmic Preparations”. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  three  main  steps:  pre-blend  preparation,  dry  blending  and 
filling/packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
As described above, Veltassa is available in three strengths and two different packaging configurations.  
Process validation activities for the finished product manufacturing process were performed at the 
commercial manufacturing site. Satisfactory process validation data on three batches of each strength 
were provided. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance,  suspendability,  identification  (FTIR,  presence  of  calcium),  patiromer  anion  content 
(gravimetry),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  total  potassium  exchange  capacity  (IC),  calcium 
content  (IC),  loss  on  drying  (gravimetry),  fluoride  (F-ISE),  extractable  impurities  (HPLC-UV),  total 
aerobic microbial count (Ph. Eur.), total combined yeasts and molds count (Ph. Eur.) and E. coli (Ph. Eur.). 
The product specifications cover appropriate parameters for this dosage form.  It is generally compliant 
with ICH Q6 and the Ph.Eur. monograph on oral powders and considers appearance, identity, 
reconstitution and uniformity of mass. 
The fluoride limit during shelf-life is in line with European Safety Authority (EFSA) recommendations for 
individuals aged 15 years and older (the product is not indicated below 18 years). 
The limit for extractable impurities is in line with the ICHQ3B limits for impurities in new drug products, for 
a daily dose of greater than 2g. Microbiological limits are in accordance with the Ph.Eur. 
The absence of a test for particle size, elemental impurities, residual solvents, potassium binding capacity 
and dissolution was justified.  
The  finished  product  is  formulated  as  a  powder  for  oral  suspension  with  a  site  of  action  in  the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Veltassa is not absorbed from the GI tract. The polymer backbone remains 
intact in the GI tract where it exerts its potassium binding effect. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of each strength and two commercial 
scale batches manufactured by the proposed finished product manufacturer confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. Additional 
batch analysis data on finished product batches produced at development sites that were used in clinical 
studies were also submitted. 
Assessment report

Stability of the product 
Stability data of twenty four pilot scale batches of finished product of four strengths (4.2, 12.6, 16.8 and 
25.2 mg) under long term conditions for 36 months at 2-8ºC and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Veltassa are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing. The batches were manufactured with active substance from the proposed active substance 
manufacturers. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  total  %  calcium,  patiromer  anion  content,  potassium  binding 
capacity,  total  potassium  exchange  capacity,  loss  on  drying,  fluoride,  extractable  polymeric 
impurities-individual  unspecified,  extractable  polymeric  impurities-total  unspecified,  total  aerobic 
microbial  counts,  total  combined  yeast  and  molds,  E.coli,  sedimentation  and  suspendability  of  drug 
product. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
All results remained within the specification limits and showed no discernible trends. The only attribute 
that showed an increase over time was fluoride content, but fluoride results for all batches at both storage 
conditions remained within the proposed acceptance criteria. 
Although an out of specification result total potassium exchange capacity was observed , it was 
considered to be sampling related, and the issue was addressed in later timepoints.  Also one of the 
twelve lots did not meet the proposed acceptance criteria for patiromer anion at release, however they all 
meet the stability acceptance criterion.  
An in-use stability study was also conducted on eight pilot scale batches of Veltassa. The purpose of this 
study was to justify in-use storage at 25°C after long term storage at 2-8°C. The stability of drug product 
was monitored to ensure specifications are maintained for specified time points at 25°C/60% RH after 
long-term storage at 2 – 8°C.  
Appearance, total % calcium, patiromer anion content, potassium binding capacity, total potassium 
exchange capacity, loss on drying, extractable impurities, and sedimentation showed no discernible 
trend. Suspendability of drug product was added as a stability attribute at the 24-month stability time 
point and tested for all lots. As expected, the only stability attribute that showed an increase during the 
in-use period was fluoride, but fluoride levels were still within the stability protocol specification. . 
Therefore, the registration in-use studies demonstrated that RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension can 
withstand storage at 25°C/60%RH for at least 6 months following storage at 2 – 8°C for up to 30 months. 
This study demonstrated that the finished product can be stored for up to six months at room temperature 
after removal from the refrigerated storage condition. This in-use period will be within the total approved 
shelf-life of 36 months. 
A controlled room temperature feasibility study was also conducted, whereby one batch was evaluated at 
2-8oC, 25oC/60%RH, 30oC/65%RH and 40oC/75%RH, in order to support limited in-use room 
temperature storage and to evaluate the impact of excursions on drug product stability.  The usual 
specification, with minor differences being inclusion of microbial quality testing, and using sedimentation 
rather than suspendability were applied.  No discernible trend was noted for appearance, total % calcium, 
patiromer anion content, potassium binding capacity, total potassium exchange capacity, loss on drying, 
extractable impurities, and sedimentation.  All results met the stability protocol acceptance criteria and 
the commercial acceptance criteria.  As expected however, a significant increase in the fluoride levels was 
seen at elevated temperatures Patiromer anion content stayed within both the proposed release 
acceptance criterion and within the proposed shelf life acceptance criterion. No evidence of microbial 
growth was observed.

A forced degradation study was also conducted on one batch. Samples were exposed to heat, H2O2, , acid 
,  and light. The results obtained demonstrated that the finished product was relatively stable to most of 
the stress conditions applied. The fluoride ion was the only degradant obtained on exposing the product 
to base, heat or light stress. The total potassium exchange capacity was unaffected by exposing the 
finished product to acid, base, heat, oxidative and light. Similarly exposure to light did not affect the 
appearance of the product, the patiromer content, extractable impurities, potassium binding capacity or 
the total potassium exchange capacity. A small but noticeable increase in the fluoride levels was obtained 
when the finished product was exposed to light. The stability-indicating nature of the analytical 
procedures was adequately demonstrated. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months at 2°C – 8°C, with an in-use period 
allowed whereby the user may store the product at 25°C for a period of six months, within the 36 month 
expiry date period (i.e. 30 months 2-8°C +6 months 25°C) as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Veltassa is a powder for oral suspension containing patiromer sorbitex calcium as active substance. The 
active  moiety,  patiromer,  is  a  non-absorbed,  cation-exchange  polymer  that  binds  potassium 
predominantly in the lumen of the colon.  This increases faecal potassium excretion, leading to removal of 
potassium from the body and lowering of serum potassium levels in hyperkalaemic patients. 
The two major issues with respect to (a) ensuring small particles that could be absorbed are not present 
in the product and (b) controlling product performance with respect to rate of potassium binding, and 
other concerns raised during the evaluation have been satisfactorily addressed. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Veltassa is a powder for oral suspension, designed to treat hyperkalaemia. The proposed indication for 
Veltassa is for treatment of hyperkalaemia. The non-clinical development programme for RLY5016 
consisted of a range of primary pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
toxicology studies, in which RLY5016 was given orally and is the same route of administration used 
clinically. Pharmacology studies were performed to demonstrate the ability of the polymer anion to bind 
to potassium in the lumen of the colon and to increase potassium faecal excretion using both in vitro and 
in vivo studies.  The safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance with current Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations at contract laboratories. Additionally, the PK absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) studies in rats and dogs were conducted in accordance 
with GLP. Except for an exploratory embryo-fetal development study conducted in rabbits, all studies in 
the toxicology program, including the definitive embryo-fetal development study in rabbits, were 
conducted at various independent GLP-compliant contract laboratories. The GLP status of the individual 
PK and toxicology studies has been provided by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology of RLY5016 has been examined using in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the 
extent RLY5016 binds to potassium and increases its excretion from the GI tract.  In the first of two in 
vitro studies, it was shown that RLY5016 is effective in ion exchange in acidic conditions similar to that 
encountered in the GI tract.  In the second study RLY5016 was shown to bind effectively to potassium in 
physiological pH conditions, and that this binding was unaffected by starting acidic form.   
Three animal models were used to explore the in vivo pharmacodynamic effects of RLY5016 binding to 
potassium.  Rats and pigs with normal renal function have been used, as have rats with chronic renal 
failure.  In each both rats and pigs following treatment with RLY5016 there was increased faecal excretion 
of potassium.  In a rat model of hyperkalaemia in rats treated with RLY5016 there was also an increase 
in potassium excretion, which was reflected in a decrease in serum potassium levels.   
In the context of this application, the results of the primary pharmacology fully support the proposed 
therapy for RLY5016 as a treatment for hyperkalaemia. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Due to a lack of systemic absorption of RLY5016, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been 
performed.  This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The applicant has completed a battery of in vivo GLP safety pharmacology studies in rats and dogs, 
providing an examination of cardiac parameters and studies to test effect on the respiratory, central 
nervous and gastrointestinal systems.  RLY5016 had no clinically relevant effects on general behaviour, 
locomotor activity, pulmonary function or cardiac function.  The only changes of note were observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424270/2017 
Page 17/73 
  
  
the gastrointestinal (GI) system.  As RLY5016 is considered to be non-absorbed, its main site of action will 
be the GI tract.   
Two GI safety pharmacology studies have been presented.  Both are of identical design; however, the first 
study was repeated due to findings of reduced stomach emptying that were assumed to be due to the 
presence of residual toluene in the drug product.  A similar finding was observed in the 4 week toxicology 
studies completed in rats and dogs.  The second gastrointestinal safety study was conducted with a 
toluene-removed batch of RLY5016.  The concern for reduced stomach emptying was not resolved by 
repeating the study and the inherent issue has been explained as a consequence of dose dumping to the 
stomach in these rat studies.  There are some questionable findings with the effects with morphine as 
gastrointestinal transit was unaffected with this positive control; however, stomach emptying was absent 
in this dose group.  
The CHMP considered that given that the proposed site of action for RLY5016 will be the GI tract, the 
concerns for reduced stomach emptying and reduced transits times observed in the rat safety 
pharmacology studies have not been sufficiently explored in the initial submission. Thus, the applicant 
was requested to discuss the implications of these findings and their potential clinical consequences. 
Following the submission of applicant’s response and a more detailed review of the available clinical data, 
the CHMP concluded that this effect of reduced gastric emptying would have only limited impact in 
humans.  
The applicant provided a detailed discussion of the potential clinical consequences of reduced stomach 
emptying seen in the animal safety pharmacology studies.  Two techniques were utilised to measure 
gastric transit of RLY5016, i) charcoal marker transit, and ii) stomach weight measurement.  It is argued 
that due to the extent of administration of RLY5016 to rats which was approximately 1.2 g, that it was 
inevitable that there would be reduced stomach emptying.  This argument is accepted and it is agreed 
that charcoal marker data would suggest no decrease in the extent of gastric motility due to 
administration of RLY5016.  An added discussion of the clinical data obtained from patients treated with 
RLY5016 oral suspension also supports this view, with limited serious gastrointestinal AE’s associated 
with treatment.  This is reflected in the revised RMP in the non-clinical summary table part, 
gastrointestinal motility as an ‘Important potential risk’.  ‘Use in patients with severe GI disorders’ is now 
raised as an ‘Important potential risk’.   
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interaction studies have been conducted with Veltassa as this drug substance is not 
considered to be systemically absorbed.  This is acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of PK studies have been completed to describe absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion characteristics of radio labelled RLY5016 in rats and dogs.  In addition, a number of in vitro 
studies were submitted to assess the potential of drug-drug interactions with RLY5016.  A dedicated study 
in rats to review the effects of fluoride absorption due to degradation of RLY5016 is provided. 
Absorption: Two studies have been completed in rats and dogs to examine the potential absorption of 
RLY5016 in vivo. Rats were dosed with up to 313 mg/kg of radiolabelled 14C-RLY5016, given as a single 
oral dose and blood and plasma sampling obtained pre- and post-dose for up to 72 hours.  Peak levels of 
14C-RLY5016 were detected in blood and plasma at 8 hours post-dose, at levels of 0.073 and 0.326 μg 
equivalents 14C-RLY5016 /g, respectively.  This is estimated to be equivalent to 0.004% of the total dose.  
No further PK measurements could be taken given the low levels of 14C-RLY5016 found in the rat.  Dogs 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424270/2017 
Page 18/73 
  
  
were administered a single oral dose of 350 mg/kg 14C-RLY5016, with plasma and blood sampling 
obtained pre- and post-dose for up to 168 hours.  Peak levels of 14C-RLY5016 were obtained between 4 
and 8 hours post-dose in both male and female dogs: 0.175 and 0.339 µg equivalents 14C-RLY5016/g for 
males, and 0.238 and 0.406 µg equivalents 14C-RLY5016/g for females.  This represents equivalent 
exposure to 14C-RLY5016 of 0.002% of the total dose.  Plasma half-life was estimated to be 127 and 98 
hours in male and female dogs, respectively.  The AUC measurements are extremely low, ranging from 
31.6 to 51 h.µg equivalents 14C-RLY5016/g. These studies demonstrate that there is a lack of systemic 
bioavailability of oral RLY5016, and systemic exposure is negligible. Furthermore, the findings support the 
absence of toxicokinetic measurements, carcinogenicity and pre/post natal toxicity studies. 
Distribution: Distribution of radiolabelled RLY5016 was measured following whole body radiography of a 
single oral dose of 313 mg/kg to male rats.  Distribution was limited to stomach, caecum and intestine 
(small and large) with most administered material detected at 4 hours post-dose, and none at 72 hours 
post-dose.  As described earlier, analysis of plasma samples obtained from the rat and dog PK study have 
shown that 0.004% and 0.002% of the administered radiolabel was present in plasma in the rat and dog, 
respectively. 
Metabolism: No specific non-clinical metabolism studies have been conducted with RLY5016.  As the 
polymer is not absorbed, the normal process of metabolism in vivo is not expected.  As a result, stability 
studies of the polymer have been performed using faecal samples obtained from treated humans.  
Polymers obtained from faecal samples were physically intact, and there was no difference in cation 
binding capacity of GI passaged, and non-passaged RLY5016.  RLY5016 has been demonstrated to be 
metabolically stable.   
Excretion: Recovery of RLY5016 has been described in the two ADME studies, in rat and dog.  Recovery 
of the radiolabelled RLY5016 in faeces and urine was 84% and 0.15%, respectively, in rats and 99.9% 
and <0.1%, respectively, in dogs.  Lower recovery in rat faeces was attributed to difficulties in obtaining 
material and in homogenising the rat samples.   
Pharmacokinetic interactions: Given the non-absorbed nature of RLY5016, pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interactions are more likely to occur with other co-administered drugs in the GI lumen vicinity.  This 
interaction may affect absorption and distribution of drugs other than RLY5016.  The applicant developed 
a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) based model to predict binding of drugs to 
RLY5016S using knowledge of a drug’s surface area of acceptor atoms, ionisation potential and 
lipophilicity.  In addition, an in vitro test system was used which measured free levels of 28 medicinal 
products concentrations after incubation in the presence or absence of RLY5016S.  Three test matrices 
were used as representative of pH conditions in the GI tract.  Of the 28 selected products, amlodipine, 
cinacalcet, ciprofloxacin, clopidogrel, furosemide, levothyroxine, lithium, metformin, metoprolol, 
trimethoprim, verapamil and warfarin were taken forward to human drug-drug interaction studies.  
Interactions have been identified with ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine and metformin. Hence, section 4.5 of 
the SmPC adequately reflects the findings of the in vitro studies in order to inform the treating physicians 
about the possible interactions. 
No examination of interactions with drug transporters or CYP enzymes was conducted, and absence of 
these studies is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Other PK studies: A study to evaluate fluoride absorption in a rat model has been presented.  Male rats 
were administered sodium fluoride, calcium fluoride, sodium and calcium loaded RLY5016, and 
absorption of fluoride was compared.  It was demonstrated that RLY5016 complexed with calcium 
resulted in lower systemic absorption of fluoride compared to RLY5016 complexed with sodium.  Lower 
exposure to fluoride would therefore be expected from RLY5016, which is complexed to calcium.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity was not evaluated in non-clinical species; this is due to the lack of systemic absorption of 
RLY5016.  This approach is agreed and further characterisations of acute effects are recorded in the rat in 
vivo micronucleus study and rat 2 week dose range finding study.  Similar dose ranging study was 
conducted in dogs.  Predominate effects were limited to diet related changes, due to high dosage of 
compound in feed.   
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose oral toxicity studies have been performed for up to 6 months in rats and for up to 9 months 
in dogs.  Concerns were raised in earlier studies with RLY5016 which contained residual levels of toluene 
which resulted in higher than expected adverse findings and as a result 4 week repeat dose studies in both 
rats and dogs were repeated with a toluene-free product.  The 4- and 26-week studies were completed in 
rats and given the lack of systemic exposure of RLY5016, no target organs were identified.  With the 
toluene-free product there was no mortality with dosing up to 13.3 g/kg/day.  The most significant finding 
was of increased food consumption, observed in both male and female rats and noted in the 4 week and 
26 week studies. The NOAEL determined from the 26 week study was >5 g/kg/day, the highest dose 
administered.  This represents a clinical safety margin of 10 based upon a maximum recommended 
human dose (MRHD) of 30 g/day (0.5 g/kg/day for a 60 kg human).  
In dogs, oral toxicity studies were performed for 4 and 39 weeks.  There was no mortality at any dose and 
no target organ for toxicity was determined.  Adverse findings were limited to faecal changes and slight 
decreases in to body weight and food consumption.  In the 39-week study there were instances of atrophy 
of seminiferous tubules in male dogs, and inflammation of heart coronary arteries.  These changes were 
low in number and a case for being spontaneous can be supported.  The NOAEL determined from the 39 
week study was 3.75 g/kg/day, the highest dose administered and this represents a clinical safety margin 
of 7.5 based upon a maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 g/day (0.5 g/kg/day for a 60 kg 
human).  The HED from dog to human is 2 g/kg/day, and a safety margin of 4.   
No toxicokinetic data has been supplied for any study in either species.  The absence of exposure data is 
justified given the lack of systemic exposure of RLY5016 as determined in the non-clinical PK studies. As 
no toxicokinetic measurement were taken during the completion of the repeat dose toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs, this approach was justified due to the non-absorbed nature of RLY5016 in both species.  
NOAELs were established in each species, 5 g/kg/day in rats and 3.75 g/kg/day in dogs. In rats the NOAEL 
of 5 g/kg/day represents a clinical safety margin of 10 based upon a maximum recommended human 
dose (MRHD) of 30 g/day (0.5 g/kg/day for a 60 kg human).  A conversion to body surface area (BSA) was 
not done in order to normalise across species to gastrointestinal volume.  Using BSA conversion of rat to 
human to determine the human equivalent dose (HED), a dose of 5 g/kg/day would be equivalent to 0.8 
g/kg/day and a safety margin of 1.6. In dogs, the NOAEL of 3.75 g/kg/day represents a clinical safety 
margin of 7.5 based upon a MRHD of 30 g/day (0.5 g/kg/day for a 60 kg human).  For information only, 
the HED from dog to human would be 2 g/kg/day, and a safety margin of 4. 
Genotoxicity 
RLY5016 has been found to be non-genotoxic when tested in-vitro and in-vivo.  In-vitro testing included 
Ames and chromosomal aberration tests and in-vivo testing included a micronucleus test in rat bone 
marrow.  The Ames bacterial cell mutation test concluded that there was no evidence of mutagenic effect.

The chromosomal aberration test using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell cultures concluded that 
RLY5016 was not clastogenic with or without metabolic activation.  The in-vivo genotoxicity of RLY5016 
was evaluated in a rat bone marrow micronucleus test and did not significantly increase the frequency of 
micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes. Based on the completed studies, RLY5016 is considered 
non-genotoxic and non-clastogenic in these test systems.   
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been completed for RLY5016. This has been justified on the basis of the 
lack of systemic exposure as demonstrated in absorption data described in the PK section.  In addition, 
there was no evidence of tumorigenic changes in the chronic animal studies over 6 or 9 month daily 
treatment.  Given the lack of systemic absorption of RLY5016, the absence of carcinogenicity studies is 
acceptable. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Male and female fertility and early embryonic development were studied in Sprague Dawley rats.  Animals 
were orally administered RLY5016S in diet, at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 g/kg/day.  In male rats there were no 
significant changes to sperm number or motility, although there was a decrease in straight-line velocity at 
the high dose of 5 g/kg/day dose. This had no effect on fertility parameters.  In female rats, there were 
no effects at any dose on pregnancy rates, implantation or foetal fertility compared to controls.  The 
NOAEL was the highest dose tested, 5 g/kg/day for male and female rats. These findings are adequately 
reflected in section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Embryo-foetal development was studied in rats and rabbits. Pregnant female rats were treated with up to 
6 g/kg/day in gestation day 6 to 17 via oral gavage.  No drug-related effects were observed at any dose 
in treated females.  There were no effects on litter sizes and no evidence of treatment-related variations 
or malformations.  The NOAEL was determined as the highest dose tested, 6 g/kg/day.  Similarly, 
non-adverse findings were observed in pregnant rabbits treated orally with up to 3 g/kg/day with 
RLY5016S.  Two control animals died in the pivotal study, one due to unknown spontaneous death, and 
the other euthanized following signs of irregular and laboured respiration. The NOAEL in pregnant rabbits 
was the highest dose tested, 3 g/kg/day.   
The wording in section 4.6 of the SmPC for pregnancy reflects the results of the non-clinical studies, and 
consider the lack of information from clinical exposure.  Given the lack of human exposure data, the text 
reflects the need of caution for use of Veltassa during breastfeeding, i.e. a decision must be made whether 
to discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue/abstain from patiromer therapy taking into account the 
benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
The absence of peri/postnatal development studies has been adequately justified, and no juvenile toxicity 
studies have been completed.   
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic data has been supplied for any study in either species.  The absence of exposure data is 
justified given the lack of systemic exposure of RLY5016 as determined in the non-clinical PK studies.

Local Tolerance  
No studies were provided to examine local tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence or 
specific toxicological studies for metabolites.  A detailed examination of actual/potential/theoretical 
impurities arising in the drug substance has been provided.  Most of the identified PDEs and calculated 
drug substance specifications are acceptable with the exception of the derived specification for fluoride. 
Following reassessment of nonclinical, clinical and stability data, the applicant has proposed a new 
acceptable limit for fluoride which is likely to result in fluoride intake below the European Food Safety 
Authority limit of 7 mg/day. Safety assessments were provided in each instance and supportive in silico 
assessment using two models has been supplied. In addition, five impurities were assessed in GLP Ames 
assay to confirm non-genotoxicity.  No concerns are raised in respect to impurities arising from the drug 
substance/manufacture.  Adequate justification of levels of residual solvents and elemental impurities is 
supplied and there is sufficient justification for limits in the final drug product specification. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
RLY5016S is a non-absorbed insoluble substance.  Two aquatic effect studies were missing in the initial 
submission by the applicant. Thus, upon CHMP’s request, these have been provided by the applicant 
during the evaluation phase. Following CHMP’s assessment, the ERA for RLY5016S was finalised 
concluding that it is likely that the use of RLY5016S is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  In 
addition, the ERA for fluoride, based upon published literature, reveals no concerns for environmental 
risk.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development programme for Veltassa consisted of a range of primary pharmacology, 
safety pharmacology, PK and toxicology studies, in which RLY5016 was given orally, the same route of 
administration as clinically used.  Pharmacology studies demonstrated the ability of the polymer anion to 
bind potassium in the lumen of the colon and to increase potassium faecal excretion.  Pharmacodynamic 
effects of Veltassa on serum potassium levels were observed in in vivo experiments performed in rats with 
normal renal function or a chronic renal failure model. In both in vivo experiments, an effect on the serum 
potassium levels was evident. The animals were fed a low calcium diet. In the study where no effect was 
seen on serum potassium levels in pigs, the animals appear to have been applied a normal production 
diet.  However, the applicant has further discussed this and although a low calcium diet for rats was used, 
it did contain more than five times the recommended daily calcium intake for humans.  Furthermore, the 
observed potential lack of efficacy may be due to the fact that studies were conducted in healthy animals 
and compensatory mechanisms involving decreased urinary potassium excretion prevented an impact on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/424270/2017 
Page 24/73 
  
  
 
 
 
serum potassium levels. In the clinical studies, efficacy on lowering serum potassium was demonstrated 
even when calcium levels were not controlled. 
The applicant further discussed the implications of the reduced stomach emptying seen in the GI studies.  
This was in part due to the large quantity of the RLY5016 administered to rats. Following a detailed review 
of clinical data, it is concluded that this effect of reduced gastric emptying would have a limited impact to 
humans. The PK studies included absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion characterisation and 
were performed in rats and dogs.  The evidence supports a lack of RLY5016 bioavailability resulting in a 
lack of, or very limited systemic exposure.   
Toxicity studies were conducted in rats and dogs (up to 26 and 39 weeks, respectively), including a full 
battery of genotoxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and a detailed review of drug-related 
impurities.  Due to the lack of systemic absorption, toxicokinetic determinations were not conducted in 
repeated-dose studies.  Most of the toxicology studies, and all pivotal studies, were conducted according 
to GLP and reveal no target organ of toxicity.   
The ERA for RLY5016S is acceptable. The use of RLY5016 is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment.   
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical perspective, the applicant adequately addressed all points raised during the 
assessment and the CHMP considers the non-clinical development of Veltassa complete. The CHMP also 
considered that there are no further measured to be conducted in a post-marketing setting. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
RLY5016 is a non-absorbed polymer; hence, no clinical PK studies have been conducted but descriptions 
of PK findings from preclinical models have been submitted. 
Absorption, distribution, elimination 
The extent of the bioavailability of the RLY5016 polymer was assessed in rats and dogs using 14C-labeled 
RLY5016.  Plasma, faecal and urinary monitoring was conducted to assess possible absorption and 
distribution of the drug.  The findings demonstrated the non-absorbed nature of the RLY5016 polymer 
and its lack of systemic bioavailability. Since the RLY5016 polymer is not systemically absorbed, 
metabolism of the compound does not occur in blood and tissues, and these were not evaluated for 
metabolites in non-clinical studies.  One study was conducted that evaluated the metabolic stability of the 
RLY5016 polymer after recovery from human faecal samples.  The physical stability of the RLY5016 beads 
during transit through the GI tract was demonstrated by recovering the test article from faecal samples 
collected in study RLY5016 101.  The beads recovered from faeces remained as intact spheres.   
The ex vivo potassium binding performance of the RLY5016 polymer was evaluated in an environment 
similar to that found in the human colon, where RLY5016 powder for oral suspension is expected to have 
its pharmacological effect. Human colonic and faecal matter was collected from three volunteers, and the 
soluble portion was isolated for use as a test medium in which to assess cation binding by RLY5016 or 
RLY5016Na (the polymer anion with calcium or sodium counter-ion, respectively). An assay concentration 
of 20 mg/mL RLY5016 was selected as an approximation of polymer concentration in the distal colon, 
assuming a 10-gram per day dose (equivalent to 8.4 g/day patiromer) and an average fluid load of 500 
mL per day. The results indicate that RLY5016 powder for oral suspension is effective at removing 
potassium from an environment similar to that found in the human colon. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was evaluated in Study RLY5016-101, a first-in-human, phase 1, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single- and multiple-dose escalation study of the safety 
and tolerability of RLY5016 in healthy adult volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 
4 treatment groups in which 6 of 8 subjects per group received RLY5016 (1 g, 5 g, 10 g, or 20 g per dose) 
orally in suspension, and 2 of 8 subjects per group received matching placebo. For each treatment group, 
a single dose of RLY5016 or placebo was administered on day 1, followed by a 10-day observation and 
diet adjustment period. After acceptable single-dose safety and tolerability was determined, RLY5016 or 
placebo was administered TID on days 12 through 19 (8 days total). At least 7 days were allowed after 
single-dose administration at a particular dose level before progression to the next higher dose level. 
RLY5016 increased potassium excretion, with statistically significant dose-dependent increases in mean 
faecal potassium excretion from baseline in the 5 g RLY5016 (617.2 mg, p = 0.0195), 10 g RLY5016 
(1,069.7 mg, p < 0.0001), and 20 g RLY5016 (1,929.4 mg, p < 0.0001) TID groups compared with the 
placebo TID group. There was a corresponding decrease in urinary potassium excretion. Accordingly, the 
faecal/urinary potassium ratio also increased with increasing doses of RLY5016, with significant 
differences observed in the RLY5016 10 g TID group (p < 0.01) and 20 g TID group (p < 0.0001) 
compared with the placebo TID group. A dose-related increase in urinary and faecal calcium excretion was 
observed in all RLY5016 treatment groups.  
A phase 1, open-label, single arm study (RLY5016-103) evaluated the time to onset of the potassium 
lowering action of RLY5016 powder for oral suspension. Subjects with CKD who had a serum potassium at 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 33/73 
 
 
 
 
screening of 5.5 to 6.2 mEq/L and who were not on dialysis were entered into a 3-day in-patient run in 
period during which they began receiving a potassium and sodium controlled diet, followed by a 48 hour 
treatment period (fixed dose of 8.4 grams patiromer administered twice a day [BID] for 4 doses, 
administered at hours 0, 10, 24, and 34) during which serum potassium was assessed repeatedly.  
Subjects were required to be on a stable dose of at least one RAASi medication for 28 days prior to 
screening and, if taking antihypertensive medications, to be on a stable dose of that medication for at 
least 14 days prior to screening. The onset of the potassium-lowering action was defined as the earliest 
time point at which the least squares [LS] mean change from baseline in serum potassium was 
statistically significantly lower than 0 mEq/L at the given time point and at all later time points.  From 
mean baseline serum potassium of 5.93 mEq/L, statistically significant reductions were observed at 7 
hours after the first dose (0.21 mEq/L) and throughout the 48-hour dosing interval (p ≤  0.001).   
After the last dose at hour 34, mean serum potassium values continued to decline, reaching a mean 
(standard deviation [SD]) maximal reduction of 0.83 (0.454) mEq/L at 7 hours after the last dose (hour 
41).  At hour 58 (i.e., 24 hours following the last dose), the mean serum potassium was similar to that at 
the time of the last dose (mean [SD] serum potassium at hour 34:  5.28 [0.373] mEq/L; at hour 41:  5.11 
[0.391] mEq/L; at hour 58:  5.27 [0.548] mEq/L). 
Special populations 
Subgroup analyses of the pooled data from Study RLY5016 301 and Study RLY5016 205 were performed 
for the following: age (< 65 years old and ≥  65 years old), gender, geographic region (US/EU countries 
and Non-EU countries), baseline body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m2 and ≥  30 kg/m2), baseline eGFR (< 
30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), presence/absence of heart failure, presence of diabetes 
mellitus and RAASi medications at baseline (1 medication and > 1 medication).  Forest plots summarising 
these subgroup analyses for the two starting doses of RLY5016 powder for oral suspension (8.4 g/day 
patiromer, baseline serum potassium > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L) and (16.8 g/day patiromer, baseline serum 
potassium > 5.5 to < 6.0 mEq/L) showed that in all of these subgroups, serum potassium decreased 
statistically significantly from baseline, with results similar to those seen for the overall population.   
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Since the RLY5016 polymer is not systemically absorbed, drug-drug interactions would arise through 
binding of the polymer to another orally administered drug in the GI tract leading to a change in 
absorption of the interacting drug.  An in vitro test system was used to evaluate potential interactions 
between RLY5016S and 28 orally administered compounds commonly used in the target patient 
population for RLY5016. The in vitro binding studies were conducted in 3 different matrices simulating the 
conditions in different parts of the GI tract over a range of pH values. Tests were performed at the highest 
proposed clinical dose of RLY5016 and the lowest clinical dose of the test drug, representing the most 
extreme conditions for a drug-drug interaction.  A binding of < 30% (equivalent to a test drug recovery 
of ≥  70%) was considered not clinically meaningful.  Twelve of 14 drugs that demonstrated binding in 
vitro (at least 30% binding in at least one test matrix) were selected for testing in human drug-drug 
interaction studies (thiamine and quinidine were not tested).  
The studies examined the effect of 25.2 g patiromer on single dose PK of the drug of interest using an 
open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-way crossover, 3-sequence study design conducted in healthy 
volunteers. Healthy volunteer subjects were randomized to one of 3 treatment sequences, ABC, BCA, and 
CAB, where treatment A was the test drug administered alone, treatment B was test drug coadministered 
with RLY5016, and treatment C was test drug administered between two RLY5016 doses, i.e., 21 hours 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 34/73 
 
 
 
 
after the first dose and 3 hours before the second RLY5016 dose. The no-effect criteria were 90% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for systemic exposure ratios within the range of 80 – 125%.  
Based on the study findings, the following conclusions were made: 
• 
Ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine, metformin and quinidine should be administered at least 3 hours 
before or after RLY5016.  
• 
For untested active substances with a narrow therapeutic window, the clinical effect and adverse 
events should be monitored on initiation or dose adjustment of either RLY5016 or the concomitant 
medicinal product, or the physician should consider measuring blood levels.  For these drugs, consider 
separating administration of RLY5016 by at least 3 hours. 
Section 4.3 of the SmPC informs the prescribing physicians about the potential of drug-drug interactions. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action is the binding of potassium to patiromer, resulting in increased faecal potassium 
excretion and decreased serum potassium levels and this was studied in study RLY5016-201. The PD 
measurements assessed in this study were serum potassium and 24-hour faecal potassium excretion. 
Administration of RLY5016 15 g/day for 7 days resulted in a mean (± SD) decrease of 0.23 ± 0.33 mEq/L 
(p = 0.14) in pre-dialysis serum potassium concentration (Day 8 versus Day 1). The change from baseline 
to on-treatment (Days 2 to 8) in mean (± SD) daily serum potassium concentration was -0.40 (± 0.44) 
mEq/L (p = 0.08). The effect of RLY5016 on mean daily serum potassium was not statistically significantly 
different whether on dialysis or not on dialysis; however, there was a numerically greater decrease in 
non-dialysis mean (± SD) daily serum potassium change from baseline (-0.45 ± 0.60 mEq/L, p = 0.13) 
compared with dialysis days (-0.33 ± 0.43 mEq/L, p = 0.11). The number of days that subjects had serum 
potassium levels in the normal range (≤  5.5 mEq/L) was greater during the treatment period (67% of 
days) than the baseline period (36% of days). Treatment with RLY5016 15 g/day for 7 days resulted in a 
significant increase in mean (± SD) faecal potassium excretion of 359 (± 277) mg/day (p = 0.02). 
Furthermore, study RLY5016 103 was conducted in 25 subjects with CKD who had serum potassium at 
screening of 5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/L.  The onset of action, defined as the earliest time point at which the LS 
mean change from baseline in serum potassium was statistically significantly lower than 0 mEq/L at the 
given time point and at all later time points, was determined to be 7 hours.  Also, this study contributed 
to the information regarding the duration of the serum potassium lowering effect after the discontinuation 
of dosing with RLY5016. The mean level of serum potassium at 24 hours post-dosing was similar to that 
at the time of the last dose. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Patiromer is a non-absorbable cation-exchange polymer.  Aside from lowering serum potassium it may 
also bind other cations such as magnesium, which are present in the GI tract.  Excessive lowering of 
serum potassium, and potentially magnesium, may have physiological consequences that include signs 
and symptoms primarily impacting muscular or cardiac function.  There are no known or expected 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 35/73 
 
 
 
 
pharmacological properties on non-gastrointestinal organ systems such as the central nervous system, 
liver, endocrine, renal and hemodynamic systems beyond signs and symptoms related to the primary 
pharmacological effect of the drug on serum potassium and, to a lesser extent, on serum magnesium.  
The primary unwanted effects of RLY5016 are gastrointestinal in nature, primarily constipation and 
diarrhoea.  Electrolyte disturbances associated with the primary pharmacologic action of the drug on 
serum potassium and magnesium have also been observed. These events are reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The main site of action of patiromer is local in the gut, with no other systemic effects expected due to the 
non-absorbed nature of patiromer. The mechanism of action has been elaborated and it is conveyed by 
binding of patiromer to potassium in the gut and excretion of the complex in the faeces. This results in a 
lower body potassium concentration. Due to the action in the gut, the possibility of binding to other active 
substances is real as it has been demonstrated in the drug-drug interaction studies. For the majority of 
tested substances, there was no evidence of a clinically significant interaction with patiromer, indicating 
that a separation in dosing is not necessary for those drugs. However, given that patients taking 
patiromer are likely to be treated by multiple physicians, general dosing instructions may help to simplify 
use in clinical practice and reduce the potential for medication errors and interactions. For all drugs tested 
where the potential for an interaction with patiromer exists, a 3-hour separation between administration 
of the test drug and patiromer was sufficient to prevent an interaction. As such, the applicant revised 
section 4.5 of the SmPC to recommend administering any other oral medication at least 3 hours before or 
3 hours after RLY5016. This recommendation has also been added to SmPC section 4.2. It is also stated 
as a prominent statement in section 2 of the PIL, as well as in the RMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology programme conducted by the applicant is sufficient 
for defining the clinical pharmacology of Veltassa. There are no measures necessary to address the issues 
related to pharmacology in the post-marketing setting. The SmPC and the RMP includes adequate 
information informing the prescribing physicians about the correct use of Veltassa and the appropriate 
implementation of risk minimisation measures particularly in the area of managing potential drug-drug 
interactions. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical programme for RLY5016 comprises twenty studies:  three Phase 1 clinical pharmacology 
studies, twelve single dose drug-drug interaction studies, four Phase 2 studies and one two-part Phase 3 
study.  In clinical studies in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure (HF) or on 
haemodialysis, the duration of administration of study drug ranged from 48 hours to 52 weeks and the 
doses ranged from 8.4 to 50.4 g/day patiromer. The proposed dosing regimen for the marketed product 
is once daily up to a maximum dose of 25.2 g/day. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study RLY5016-205 : Multicentre, Randomised, Open, Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of RLY5016 in the treatment of Hyperkalaemia in Patients with Hypertension and Diabetic 
Nephropathy Receiving ACEI and/or ARB Drugs, with or without Spironolactone. The primary objective of 
the study was to determine the optimal starting dose of RLY5016 in treating hyperkalaemia in subjects 
with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 36/73 
 
 
 
 
and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) drugs, with or without spironolactone. Secondary objectives 
were to determine the safety and efficacy of RLY5016 in treating hyperkalaemia in the above population 
and to evaluate the chronic use of RLY5016. The study had two treatment periods; firstly a treatment 
initiation period (TIP) lasting 8 weeks, followed by a Long-term Maintenance Period for an additional 44 
weeks. Eligible subjects with screening serum potassium of 4.3 to 5.0 mEq/L and uncontrolled 
hypertension started a Run-in Period of 1 to up to 4 weeks in duration.  During which Cohort 1 subjects 
discontinued pre-study RAASi medication and started losartan 100 mg.  Spironolactone was added if 
necessary for additional blood pressure control.  Cohort 2 subjects continued on their pre-study ACEI or 
ARB medication and added spironolactone to the regimen.  Cohort 3 had serum potassium > 5.0 to < 6.0 
mEq/L at screening or start of the Run-in Period and entered the TIP immediately while continuing to 
receive their current ACEI and/or ARB regimen. Subjects from all three cohorts were assigned to one of 
two strata according to baseline serum potassium: 
• 
• 
Stratum 1 (serum potassium values > 5.0 to 5.5 mEq/L) subjects were randomised to one of three 
RLY5016 starting doses: 8.4, 16.8, or 25.2 g/day patiromer 
Stratum 2 (serum potassium values > 5.5 to < 6.0 mEq/L) subjects were randomised to one of three 
RLY5016 starting doses: 16.8, 25.2, or 33.6 g/day patiromer 
All RLY5016 doses were administered BID.  Doses of RLY5016 were titrated based on individual subject 
response to achieve and maintain serum potassium in the range of 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L during the 8-week 
TIP and in the range of 3.8 to 5.0 mEq/L during the 44 week LTMP. The dose of RLY5016 could be adjusted 
starting on Day 3 and up to the Week 51 Visit according to a titration algorithm that was designed to 
maintain serum potassium levels within a target range. An interim data analysis was performed based on 
data collected from approximately 20 subjects per starting dose group who completed the Week 4 
treatment visit or who had prematurely discontinued from the study and had primary efficacy data. The 
mean change in central laboratory serum potassium from baseline to Week 4 (or prior to the initiation of 
RLY5016 dose titration, if occurs before Week 4) and its standard deviation (SD) for each starting dose 
group were calculated based on this interim data set. These interim results were used to determine the 
optimal starting dose of RLY5016 for each serum potassium stratum for future studies. 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Men and women ages 30 to 80 years old who met the following 
criteria were eligible for the study: 
•  Diagnosed with T2DM after age 30 and treated with oral medication or insulin for at least 1 year 
prior to screening 
•  Had chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 15 to 
< 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at screening 
•  Had received an ACEI and/or ARB for at least 28 days prior to screening. Any subject with a 
history of hypertension must have had average systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 130 to ≤  180 
mmHg AND average diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 80 to ≤  110 mmHg (sitting) at 
screening. Whereas Cohorts 1 and 2 subjects must have had a diagnosis of hypertension to 
be enrolled in the study, Cohort 3 subjects without a history of hypertension could be 
enrolled. 
•  Had the following local serum potassium values: 
Cohorts 1 and 2 
o  At screening visit (S1): 4.3 to 5.0 mEq/L AND 
o  At first Run-in Period visit (R0): ≤  5.0 mEq/L (original protocol) or 4.5 to 5.0 mEq/L 
(Amendment 1) AND 
o  At randomisation (baseline visit [T0]): > 5.0 to < 6.0 mEq/L Cohort 3 
o  > 5.0 to < 6.0 mEq/L at S1 OR at R0 (after same day confirmation) • If in Cohorts 1 or 2 
(non-hyperkalemic subjects who entered a Run-in Period), must have had: 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 37/73 
 
 
 
 
o  Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥  100 mg/g (original protocol) or ≥  30 mg/g  
(Amendment 1) at S1 AND - Average urine ACR ≥  100 mg/g (original protocol) or ≥  30 
mg/g (Amendment 1) at the beginning of the R0 based on up to three ACR values starting 
at S1 and ending at R0. 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: RLY5016 was provided as a powder for oral suspension, 
comprising the drug substance, RLY5016S (the polymer anion and a calcium-sorbitol counterion complex 
and formulated with xanthan gum). RLY5016 was packaged in packets (4.2 grams patiromer per packet) 
and assembled as a kit for dispensing.  Subjects were to take the drug orally in the morning and evening 
with meals and to mix study drug with water or a low-potassium food or drink prior to administration. 
Losartan was provided from commercial supplies of 100mg tablets. Subjects in Cohort 1 were to take 
losartan orally once daily in the morning starting the morning after the R0 Visit of the Run-In Period. The 
dose remained at 100 mg/day throughout the study and could be taken for the duration of the study, 
including the follow-up period. 
Spironolactone: 25 to 50 mg/day by mouth. Commercially available product (25-mg tablets).  Subjects 
were to take spironolactone once daily. Spironolactone 25 mg/day was started on the morning following 
the R0 Visit (for non-hyperkalemic subjects assigned to Cohort 2) or on the day of the R2 Visit (for 
non-hyperkalemic subjects assigned to Cohort 1 who did not attain the blood pressure (BP) target of 
130/80 mmHg). The dose could subsequently be increased to 50 mg/day before the T0 Visit in the TIP or 
during the LTMP. Spironolactone could be taken throughout the study, including the Follow-up Period. 
Statistical Methods: Three populations were defined for analysis: 
•  Safety Population - all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of RLY5016. 
• 
ITT Population - all subjects who were randomised to receive one of the three starting dose levels 
within each stratum and received at least one dose of RLY5016. The primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses were based on the ITT Population. 
•  PP Population - all subjects in the ITT Population who were compliant with RLY5016 defined as 
taking 80% to 120% of the dispensed dose, and who did not have any important protocol 
deviations. Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint analysis were based on the PP 
Population. 
Parallel lines analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were used for the analysis of change from baseline 
of serum potassium levels at Week 4 and Week 8 within each stratum. The models included the treatment 
factor and baseline serum potassium value as the covariate. The least squares estimate of the mean 
change from baseline of each treatment and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined. A paired 
t-test was used to test whether the mean change from baseline in serum potassium was different from 
zero. A 95% CI of the pairwise difference between any two RLY5016 starting dose groups in the mean 
change of serum potassium was constructed. Time to events was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier 
method; the Fisher’s exact test was used for comparisons of proportions. Statistical tests were performed 
at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. All tests were two-sided. 
Study Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in serum potassium from baseline 
to Week 4 (or prior to titration of the RLY5016 dose, if it occurred prior to Week 4). 
RESULTS OF STUDY RLY5016-205   
Demography and subject disposition: Three hundred and six subjects were randomised of whom 304 
received study treatment. A total of 266 subjects completed the 8-week TIP and 197 completed the one 
year study period. A majority of the 304 subjects were male (63%) and all were Caucasian with a mean 
(±SD) age of 66.3 ± 8.61 years (range 37 to 80).  In both strata, the highest percentages of subjects had 
screening CKD stages of Stage 3a, 3b, or 4 (based on screening eGFR results).  Subjects in the Stratum 
2 starting dose groups with higher mean serum potassium levels at baseline had lower mean eGFR at

study entry, and there were higher proportions of subjects with CKD Stage 4 or 5 in Stratum 2 compared 
with Stratum 1.  All subjects had T2DM and hypertension. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The mean change from baseline in serum potassium at Week 4 or prior to dose 
titration was statistically significant for all dose groups within both strata (p < 0.001).  The observed least 
square (LS) mean (SE) overall change at Week 4 in Stratum 1 was - 0.47 (0.039) mEq/L (- 0.35,  - 0.51, 
and - 0.55 mEq/L for the 8.4, 16.8, and 25.2 g/day patiromer starting dose groups, respectively). The LS 
mean (SE) overall change in Stratum 2 was - 0.92 (0.075) mEq/L (- 0.87, - 0.97, - 0.92 mEq/L for the 
16.8, 25.2, and 33.6 g/day patiromer dose groups, respectively). 
Treatment Initiation Period: Mean decreases in serum potassium from baseline to all time points during 
the TIP (regardless of titration) were observed for each starting dose group within both strata, including 
at Day 3 following administration of approximately 4 doses of RLY5016.  Throughout the entire TIP, the LS 
mean change from baseline in Stratum 2 were consistently larger than those in Stratum 1.  The range of 
the LS mean (SE) change from baseline overall for Stratum 2 was -0.59 (0.048) mEq/L (Day 3) to -1.14 
(0.051) mEq/L (Week 5) and for Stratum 1 was -0.29 (0.028) mEq/L (Day 3) to -0.66 (0.027) mEq/L 
(Week 5).  At Week 4, the proportion of Stratum 1 subjects with serum potassium within the range of 4.0 
to 5.0 mEq/L was 85.4% and for Stratum 2 was 72.6%, and at 8 weeks was 89.1% and 82.9%, 
respectively.  
Long-Term Maintenance Period:  Regardless of stratum or starting dose, mean serum potassium values 
were decreased from baseline at every time point during the LTMP.  The mean change from baseline in 
serum potassium for Stratum 1 subjects at all LTMP time points was approximately -0.50 mEq/L, and the 
mean change from baseline for Stratum 2 subjects for the same time points was approximately -1.00 
mEq/L.  At Week 28, the proportion of Stratum 1 subjects with serum potassium within the range of 3.8 
to 5.0 mEq/L was 89.0% and for Stratum 2 was 95.1%, and at 52 weeks was 85.5% and 89.8%, 
respectively  
Post-treatment Follow-up:  Serum potassium values started to increase after treatment with RLY5016 
was discontinued.  At Days 3 and 7 of the Follow-up Period the mean (SD) change from the end of 
treatment was 0.22 (0.453) mEq/L (n = 163) and 0.29 (0.503) mEq/L (n = 154), respectively, for 
subjects in Stratum 1 and 0.29 (0.564) mEq/L (N = 58) and 0.46 (0.540) mEq/L (n = 57), respectively, 
for subjects in Stratum 2. 
Based on a pre-planned interim analysis, the lowest effective dose in each stratum was selected as 
starting doses for Phase 3 in the absence of a clear dose-dependent response.  For subjects with baseline 
serum potassium of 5.1 to < 5.5 mEq/L, the selected starting dose was 8.4 g/day patiromer, and for 
subjects with a baseline serum potassium of ≥  5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/L the selected starting dose was 16.8 
g/day patiromer.

Study RLY5016-204: Multicentre, Open, Single-arm Study to Evaluate a Titration Regimen for RLY5016 
in Heart Failure Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. 
Patients were enrolled at thirteen study centres in Georgia and Slovenia from May to September 2010. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of individualised titration of RLY5016 
according to serum potassium (K+). The secondary objectives were to assess the effects of RLY5016 on 
serum potassium in heart failure (HF) subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to assess the safety 
and tolerability of RLY5016 HF subjects with CKD. 
Methods: This was an open-label, single-arm study to evaluate a titration regimen for RLY5016 in 
subjects with HF and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) receiving 
one or more of the following: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs) or beta blockers (BB). Following successful completion of screening and baseline (Day 0) 
evaluations, eligible subjects were enrolled in the study. On Day 1, subjects commenced treatment with 
RLY5016 10 g/day twice daily and spironolactone 25 mg/day once daily. Subjects were to receive 
RLY5016 for 8 weeks. Study visits were scheduled for Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56. A 
follow-up visit was to occur on Day 63 or 7 days after the last dose. At selected study visits, RLY5016 or 
spironolactone doses were adjusted according to a dosing algorithm designed to maintain each subject’s 
serum potassium in the target range of 4.0 – 5.1 mEq/L. RLY5016 could be titrated up or down by 10 
g/day to a minimum of 0 g/day or a maximum of 60 g/day. Spironolactone could be increased once to 50 
mg/day, and no decreases were allowed. Any subject with a serum potassium value < 3.5 or > 5.5 mEq/L 
on two consecutive study visits despite dose titration was withdrawn from the study. During the 8-week 
treatment period, subjects were prohibited from taking polymer based drugs, other phosphate or 
potassium binders, potassium-sparing medications (i.e., potassium-sparing diuretics and other 
non-study aldosterone antagonists [AAs]), potassium supplements and intravenous cardiac medications. 
At each study visit, serum potassium efficacy assessments and safety assessments (e.g., adverse events 
and 12-lead electrocardiograms were performed.  
Inclusion criteria: Eligible subjects were at least 18 years of age, had a history of chronic HF, were 
clinically indicated to start spironolactone therapy, had a serum potassium measurement of 4.3 – 5.1 
mEq/L at screening and baseline, had CKD with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening based on 
serum creatinine and using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, and were taking 
one or more HF therapies (ACEIs, ARBs, or BBs). Women of childbearing potential must have been 
non-lactating, must have had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and must have used a highly 
effective form of contraception for at least three months before RLY5016 administration, during the 
study, and for one month after study completion. Male subjects and/or their female partners of 
child-bearing potential must have used a highly effective form of contraception during the study and for 
three months after study completion.  
Exclusion criteria: a history of bowel obstruction, swallowing disorders, severe gastrointestinal disorders, 
or major surgery, uncorrected primary severe valvular disease, known obstructive or restrictive 
cardiomyopathy, or uncontrolled or hemodynamically unstable arrhythmia,  an episode of unstable 
angina, a transient ischemic attack or stroke, or unresolved acute coronary syndrome within 2 months 
prior to baseline, recent (within 3 months prior to baseline) or anticipated need for cardiac surgery or 
intervention, heart or kidney transplantation or need for such transplantation during the study, receiving 
dialysis or anticipated need for dialysis during the study, sustained systolic blood pressure > 180 or < 90 
mmHg; elevated liver enzymes (> 3 times the upper limit of normal), use of loop and thiazide diuretics

that had not been stable for at least 21 days prior to baseline, use of potassium sparing medication 
including AAs or potassium supplements in the last 21 days prior to baseline, or any condition within 30 
days prior to baseline that had the potential to interfere with study compliance or jeopardise the safety of 
the subject. 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: RLY5016 was supplied as a powder for oral suspension 
formulated with sorbitol, xanthan gum, silicone dioxide, yellow colour, titanium oxide and parabens 
packaged in sachets containing 5 g of RLY5016. Subjects were to take RLY5016 orally in the morning and 
evening with regular meals. Prior to administration, it was mixed with water, cranberry juice, or a 
low-potassium food. RLY5016 was initiated at a dose of 10 g twice a day and adjusted up or down by 10 
g/day to maintain serum potassium in the target range of 4.0 – 5.1 mEq/L according to a pre-specified 
dosing algorithm. The minimum allowed dose was 0 g/day and the maximum allowed dose was 60 g/day. 
Subjects received RLY5016 for an 8-week treatment period (56 days). 
In addition to RLY5016 subjects initiated treatment with spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg/day. Subjects 
were to take spironolactone orally once daily for 8 weeks. After Day 3, at the first occurrence of a serum 
potassium value of ≤  5.1 mEq/L, the spironolactone dose was increased once to 50 g/day; dose 
reductions were not allowed. 
Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with central laboratory serum 
potassium in the range of 3.5 – 5.5 mEq/L at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were the 
percentage of subjects maintaining central laboratory serum potassium in pre-specified ranges (3.5 – 5.5 
mEq/L and 4.0 – 5.1 mEq/L) by visit and during the treatment period; the mean dose of RLY5016 at the 
end of the study; the percentage of subjects requiring an up-titration or down-titration of the RLY5016 
dose; the mean time to RLY5016 dose titration; mean number of RLY5016 titrations; RLY5016 dose by 
visit; the mean change from baseline in central laboratory serum potassium to the end of the study; the 
percentage of subjects discontinuing due to hyperkalaemia (serum K+ > 5.5 mEq/L); the change in urine 
albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) from baseline to Weeks 4 and 8 in subjects with a ACR of ≥  30 mg/g at 
baseline; the percentage of subjects whose spironolactone dose could be increased to 50 mg/day. 
Safety was assessed by the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs, the incidence of clinically 
significant changes from baseline in clinical laboratory values (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, 
and serum fluoride), the incidence of clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs and ECG 
parameters, and the percentage of subjects who discontinued treatment with RLY5016 and 
spironolactone due to hypokalaemia (defined as a serum K+ value < 3.5 mEq/L). 
Statistical Methods: The study was to enrol approximately 60 subjects to ensure that at least 50 would 
receive RLY5016 and provide efficacy data for analysis. The sample size of 50 was not determined by 
formal sample size calculations; 50 subjects were considered appropriate based on the response to 
RLY5016 in prior studies. Data from all enrolled subjects who received RLY5016 and had available data 
were included in efficacy analyses. 
For the primary efficacy variable, the proportion of subjects with central laboratory serum potassium in 
the range of 3.5 – 5.5 mEq/L at the end of the study and its 95% CI were calculated and summarised for 
all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and who had at least one central 
laboratory post-baseline serum potassium value while on study drug or within one day after taking the 
last dose of study drug. Efficacy analyses were based on central laboratory values. The Clopper - Pearson 
method was used to calculate 95% binomial CIs for each of these percentages. No statistical hypothesis 
testing was conducted. Serum potassium data obtained more than one day after the last study dose was 
not used for the efficacy data analysis of the primary endpoint. Subgroup analyses were performed based 
on diabetes status, entry group (baseline serum K+ 4.3 – 5.1 mEq/L and baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min, 
ages < 65 years and ≥  65 years, ages < 70 years and ≥  70 years, gender, BMI and country. Statistical

tests used for exploratory analyses of changes from baseline and subgroup differences in selected efficacy 
and safety parameters were performed at the p = 0.05 significance level. All tests were two sided.  
RESULTS OF STUDY RLY5016-204 
Subject Disposition, Demographics, and Baseline Characteristics: A total of 63 subjects were enrolled and 
received treatment, 56 (88.9%) completed the 8-week treatment period, and 7 (11.1%) prematurely 
discontinued from the study. The reasons for discontinuation were death 1 (1.6%) subject during 
treatment, AEs 4 (6.3%) subjects, serum K+ > 5.5 mEq/L for two consecutive study visits, protocol 
violation 1 (1.6%) subject. Two additional deaths occurred 5 and 26 days after the last dose of RLY5016.  
The 63 subjects had a mean age of 70.8 years, were all Caucasian, predominantly male 61.9%, and had 
a mean BMI of 28.6 kg/m2. All subjects had a history of HF (primarily ischemic 63.5%) with a mean 
duration of 3.9 years and characterised as New York Heart Association class II (46%) or III (54%). All 
subjects also had CKD (Stage 3a, 36.5%; Stage 3b, 41.3%; Stage 4, 7.9%); other comorbidities included 
hypertension (93.7%) and diabetes (42.9%). At baseline, subjects had a mean ejection fraction (EF) of 
38.6%, the majority (52.4%) of whom had systolic dysfunction (EF < 40%), and a mean eGFR of 45.9 
mL/min/1.73 m2. The baseline mean central laboratory serum K+ value was 4.78 mEq/L. All subjects 
were taking an ACEI, ARB or BB at baseline. No subject was taking triple therapy (ACEI, ARB, and BB). 
Primary Efficacy Variable: RLY5016 administered at a starting dose of 20 g/day with individualised 
titration effectively controlled serum potassium levels that were within normal limits at baseline in 
subjects with HF and CKD who were started on spironolactone; 90.5% (95% CI 80.4%, 96.4%) of 
subjects had central laboratory serum potassium levels in the range of 3.5 – 5.5 mEq/L at the end of the 
8-week study treatment period. 
Secondary Efficacy Variables: The percentage of subjects maintaining central laboratory serum 
potassium within 3.5 – 5.5 mEq/L by visit ranged from 91.2% to 100%, and was 76.2% (95% CI: 63.8%, 
86.0%) during the entire 8-week study treatment period. The percentage of subjects maintaining central 
laboratory serum potassium within 4.0 – 5.1 mEq/L by visit ranged from 72.6% to 90.3%, and was 30.2% 
(95% CI: 19.2%, 43.0%) during the entire 8-week study treatment period. The mean ± standard 
deviation of on-treatment daily dose of RLY5016 was 22.5 ± 7.8 g. 33.3% of subjects required 
up-titration of RLY5016 at any time during the study. 12.7% of subjects required down-titration of 
RLY5016 at any time during the study. The median time (95%CI) to first RLY5016 titration was 21 (14.0, 
36.0) days. The mean ± SD number of RLY5016 titrations during the study was 1.3 ± 1.1. The mean ± SD 
RLY5016 daily dose by visit from Weeks 2 – 8 ranged from 21.7 ± 6.1 g to 23.0 ± 12.4 g. The mean ± SD 
change in central laboratory serum potassium from baseline (4.78 ± 0.508 mEq/L) to the end of study 
was –0.13 ± 0.686 mEq/L. One (1.6%) subject was withdrawn from the study based on a pre-specified 
withdrawal criterion of two consecutive local laboratory serum K+ values > 5.5 mEq/L despite a RLY5016 
or spironolactone dose titration at the first of these two visits. Spironolactone doses were successfully 
up-titrated to 50 mg/day in all subjects by Day 14.

The efficacy data for RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension are derived from five clinical studies: 
•  RLY5016-301 - “A Two-Part, Single-Blind, Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of 
Patiromer for the Treatment of Hyperkalemia.” 
•  RLY5016-205 - “A Multicenter, Randomized, Open-Label, Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of RLY5016 in the Treatment of Hyperkalemia in Patients with Hypertension 
and Diabetic Nephropathy Receiving ACEI and/or ARB Drugs, with or without Spironolactone.” 
•  RLY5016-103  -  “A  Phase  1  Open-Label,  Single  Arm  Study  of  the  Time  to  Onset  of  Action  of 
RLY5016 (Patiromer) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease and Hyperkalemia.” 
•  RLY5016-202  -  “A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-Controlled,  Parallel-Group, 
Multiple-Dose Study to Evaluate the Effects of RLY5016 in Heart Failure Patients.” 
•  RLY5016-204 - “A Multicenter, Open-Label, Single-Arm Study to Evaluate a Titration Regimen for 
RLY5016 in Heart Failure Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.” 
Studies 301 and 205 are considered “Treatment Studies” because subjects enrolled in these studies had 
elevated serum potassium at baseline, whereas Studies 202 and 204 are considered “Prevention Studies” 
because subjects in these studies had normal serum potassium at baseline, but were started concurrently 
on spironolactone and the investigational drug at the beginning of the study. Of the five studies, all used 
individualized dose titration, except for Study 103 and Study 202, in which a fixed dose was given.  
Pivotal trial RLY5016-301  
A two part, single-blind, phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of patiromer for the treatment 
of hyperkalaemia.  
Methods 
This was a single-blind study in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) at least 15 mL/min/1.73m2 and less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 who were receiving a 
stable dose of at least one renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi). At the beginning of the 
study, subjects were required to be hyperkalaemic with serum potassium of 5.1 to < 6.5 mEq/L. The 
study consisted of two sequential parts: Part A was an assessment of 4 weeks of dosing with RLY5016 in 
the treatment of hyperkalaemia; Part B was a randomised, placebo-controlled, 8-week assessment of the 
withdrawal of RLY5016 conducted in those subjects with a baseline serum potassium at the beginning of 
Part A ≥ 5.5 mEq/L who responded to the 4 weeks of treatment with RLY5016.

Part B 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 44/73 
 
 
 
 
To be eligible for Part B, subjects had to meet all of the following; baseline serum potassium at the 
beginning of Part A ≥ 5.5 mEq/L, completed the four weeks of dosing with RLY5016 in Part A, serum 
potassium at the Part A Week 4 visit in target range for Part A (≥ 3.8 mEq/L and < 5.1 mEq/L), receiving 
RLY5016 at a dose of 8.4 to 50.4 g/day patiromer at the Part A Week 4 visit, and still receiving treatment 
with a RAASi at the Part A Week 4 visit. 
Treatments 
During Part A, the RLY5016 dose was titrated, if needed, based on the serum potassium level starting at 
Day 3 and continuing to the end of 4 weeks with the aim of achieving serum potassium in a target range 
of 3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L. If a subject’s serum potassium level was outside of the target range, RLY5016 dose 
titration was performed according to a protocol.  
Part A titration algorithm. The RLY5016 dose could be titrated to a maximum of 50.4 g/day patiromer; the 
in increments of ±8.4 g/day. If the serum potassium level was ≥ 6.5 mEq/L or if the serum potassium 
level was ≥ 5.1 mEq/L and the subject was receiving the maximum dose of RLY5016 patiromer the RAASi 
was to be stopped. Subjects who withdrew from the study during the 4 weeks of Part A or who, at the end 
of Part A, were not eligible for Part B, entered a 1 to 2-week follow-up period to Part A.   
Part B was a randomised, placebo-controlled, 8-week assessment of the withdrawal of RLY5016. Subjects 
with a baseline serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L at the beginning of Part A were entered into Part B if they 
had responded to the 4 weeks of treatment with RLY5016 defined as completing Part A and satisfying all 
of the following at Week 4 visit; serum potassium in the range 3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L, receiving a RAASi and 
receiving RLY5016 at a dose of 8.4 to 50.4 g/day. Subjects eligible for Part B were randomised 1:1 to 
either continue RLY5016 at the same daily dose or withdraw RLY5016 and receive placebo for an 
additional 8 weeks.  
During Part B, RLY5016 (and RAASi) dose modification or discontinuation was performed according to 
protocol-specified titration algorithms based on serum potassium levels assessed starting at the Part B 
Day 3 visit and continuing through weekly visits to the end of the 8 week withdrawal phase. Because the 
primary efficacy endpoint for Part B was determined during the first 4 weeks of Part B, the titration 
algorithm specified no change of dose or discontinuation of RLY5016 or RAASi during the first 4 weeks of 
Part B unless the serum potassium level was < 3.8 mEq/L or ≥ 5.5 mEq/L. If a subject’s serum potassium 
was < 3.8 mEq/L, the subject was withdrawn. To help retain subjects in the study an intervention 
(increase in RLY5016 or, for subjects receiving placebo, decrease in RAASi dose) was specified during the 
first 4 weeks of Part B. If a subject’s serum potassium was ≥ 5.5 mEq/L after the first 4 weeks of Part B, 
the titration algorithm also specified an increase in RLY5016 dose upon the initial occurrence of a serum 
potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L. During Part B, the RLY5016 dose could be increased to a maximum of 50.4 g/day 
in increments of 8.4 g/day. 
Depending on the serum potassium level, the Part B titration algorithms also specified safety visits within 
24 or 72 hours and/or early withdrawal from Part B of the study. Subjects who either withdrew early from 
or completed Part B phase entered a 1- to 2-week follow-up period to Part B during which neither 
RLY5016 nor placebo was administered and serum potassium was monitored. Part B follow-up visits were 
scheduled at 3 and 7 days after stopping RLY5016. Depending on the serum potassium level, an 
additional Part B follow-up visit at 14 days after stopping RLY5016 was required. Part B follow up included 
the possibility of dose reduction or discontinuation of RAASi and the specification of standard care for 
hyperkalaemia if indicated based on the serum potassium level.

Objectives 
Part A: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of patiromer for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. 
Part B:  
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the effect of withdrawing patiromer on serum potassium control; 
To assess whether chronic treatment with patiromer prevents the recurrence of hyperkalaemia  
To provide placebo-controlled safety data. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Part A: The primary efficacy endpoint for Part A was the mean change in serum potassium from Part A 
baseline to Week 4. Changes in serum potassium from baseline to other scheduled visits during Part A 
were also summarised but were not considered formal endpoints. The secondary efficacy endpoint for 
Part A was the proportion of subjects with a centrally measured serum potassium level that was in the 
Part A target range (3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L) after 4 weeks of treatment. 
Part B: The primary efficacy endpoint for Part B was the median change from Part B baseline serum 
potassium to serum potassium (central laboratory) at either:  
• 
• 
the Part B Week 4 visit, if the subject’s serum potassium (local laboratory) remained ≥ 3.8 mEq/L 
and < 5.5 mEq/L up to the Part B Week 4 visit or 
the earliest Part B visit at which the subject’s serum potassium (local laboratory) was < 3.8 mEq/L 
or ≥ 5.5 mEq/L. 
The secondary endpoints for Part B were: the proportion of subjects with a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L 
at any time to Week 8, and the proportion of subjects with a serum potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L at any time 
to Week 8. 
Sample size 
The sample size of the study was planned in order to have at least 90% statistical power to detect a 
difference between RLY5016 for Oral Suspension and placebo with respect to the primary efficacy 
endpoint in Part B. Assuming a difference of 0.48 mEq/L between the RLY5016 for Oral Suspension and 
placebo groups in the mean change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the Part B Week 4 visit 
and a standard deviation of 0.40 mEq/L in both the RLY5016 for Oral Suspension and placebo groups 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 46/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(estimated based on data from subjects having received RLY5016 for Oral Suspension in previous study 
RLY5016-205), a sample size of 40 in each group in Part B was estimated to provide over 90% power. To 
ensure at least 40 subjects per group in Part B, Part A was planned to enrol approximately 240 subjects. 
With 240 subjects enrolled, Part A was estimated to have more than 99% power to detect a mean change 
from baseline in serum potassium ≥  0.3 mEq/L. This estimate of statistical power was based on a 
two-sided one-sample paired t-test, significance level of 0.05 and the assumption of a standard deviation 
of 0.55 mEq/L (estimated based on baseline data from previous study RLY5016- 205).  
Randomisation 
Part A: 
Not randomized. 
Part B: a randomized withdrawal study; will enter subjects from Part A Week 4 Visit (AW4), ensuring 
equal distribution between placebo and active groups of subjects within each of the following four strata: 
The purpose of randomization at the beginning of Part B is to ensure balance of Part A baseline serum 
potassium and presence of diabetes in the two treatment groups. Subjects who meet the eligibility 
requirements will be randomized equally into the two treatment groups (patiromer and placebo) within 
each of the four stratification combination groups across all study sites. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is a single-blind study where the subjects were blinded to treatment assignment. Most investigational 
study staff were unblinded to treatment assignment (active during Part A and active versus placebo in 
Part B).  
Statistical methods 
The sample size was planned to have at least 90% statistical power to detect the difference between 
RLY5016 and placebo with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint in Part B. Sample size of 40 in each 
group in Part B was estimated to provide over 90% power. To ensure at least 40 subjects per group in Part 
B, Part A was planned to enrol approximately 240 subjects; Part A was estimated to have more than 99% 
power to detect a mean change from baseline in serum potassium ≥  0.3 mEq/L. Randomisation in Part B 
was stratified to ensure equal distribution to the placebo and RLY5016 groups within the four strata 
formed by the combination of the following two baseline characteristics: (1) T2DM (yes/no), (2) Part A 
baseline serum potassium (< 5.8 mEq/L versus ≥  5.8 mEq/L). For the primary efficacy endpoint of Part 
A, the mean change in serum potassium and 95% CI was estimated using a longitudinal repeated 
measures model of serum potassium from the Part A Week 1 visit to Week 4 visit. The model included two 
binary covariates, presence of heart failure (HF) at baseline and presence of T2DM at baseline and one 
continuous covariate, Part A baseline serum potassium. For the secondary efficacy endpoint of Part A, 
stratified estimates of the proportion, standard error (SE) and 95% CI were calculated with stratification 
by HF at baseline (yes/no), T2DM at baseline (yes/no) and Part A baseline serum potassium level (< 5.5 
mEq/L versus ≥  5.5 mEq/L). 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of Part B, the two treatment groups were compared using an analysis of 
variance of the rank-transformed data that included factors corresponding to the four randomisation 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 47/73 
 
 
 
 
 
strata. A Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the between-group difference (placebo – RLY5016) in median 
change in serum potassium was calculated and a 95% CI was constructed. The approach to ranking for 
the ANOVA accounted for values based on data prior to the Part B Week 4 visit by using the last observed 
rank carried forward. For each of the two secondary efficacy endpoints of Part B, the proportions in the 
two treatment groups were compared using a Mantel-Haenszel test stratified by the four randomisation 
strata; a Hochberg correction was used in assessing these two endpoints to ensure an overall Type I error 
rate of 0.05. Exploratory efficacy endpoints in Part B included the proportion of subjects who required 
protocol specified management of recurrent hyperkalaemia (i.e., RAASi dose reduction or discontinuation 
in the placebo group; patiromer dose increase or RAASi discontinuation in the RLY5016 group). 
Analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in Part A and Part B were based on all subjects 
who received at least one dose of investigational product, the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Sensitivity 
analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the efficacy findings, including analyses based on 
per protocol populations (subjects with no important protocol deviations and subjects compliant with 
study drug). Subgroup analyses of efficacy by demographic and relevant baseline characteristics were 
also conducted. 
Safety analyses included incidence of AEs with onset during Part A, incidence of AEs with onset during Part 
B by IP received (placebo or RLY5016) and incidence of AEs reported at any time during the study for 
those who continued into Part B. Analyses were also performed for SAEs, AEs considered by the 
investigator to be related to the IP and AEs leading to IP discontinuation or modification. Additional 
summaries presented events of interest, which included potassium-related ECG changes, serum 
potassium < 3.8 mEq/L, serum potassium ≥  5.5 mEq/L and selected types of AEs (e.g., renal events, 
those in the GI system and allergic reactions). Clinical laboratory test results (including serum 
magnesium, serum calcium and other electrolytes) were summarised descriptively over time and using 
standard shift tables. ECG changes were summarised, including shifts from normal to abnormal. 
Summaries of vital signs included mean changes in blood pressure over time and proportions of subjects 
with specified changes in blood pressure. 
In Part A, the safety population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one dose of 
RLY5016. In Part B, the safety population was defined as all randomised subjects who received at least 
one dose of randomised IP. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 243 subjects were enrolled in Part A; 92 (38%) had a screening serum potassium of 5.1 to < 5.5 
mEq/L and were assigned to Dose Group 1 (starting dose of 8.4 g/day patiromer; 151 (62%) had a 
screening serum potassium of 5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/L and were assigned to Dose Group 2 (starting dose of 
16.8 g/day patiromer). A total of 219 subjects; 92% of Group 1 and 89% of Group 2 completed the 4 
weeks of Part A and 24 subjects 8% of Group 1 and 11% of Dose Group 2 withdrew early.  
Of the subjects enrolled in Part A  58% were male and 98% were white. The median age was 65 years 
(range 29 to 80); 64% were enrolled in Eastern Europe/non-EU countries, 27% were enrolled in the EU 
and 9% were enrolled in the US. Based on eGFR 45% had Stage 4 CKD or worse (eGFR < 30), 26% had 
Stage 3b CKD (eGFR 30 to < 45), 20% had Stage 3a CKD (eGFR 45 to <60) and 9% had Stage 2 CKD 
(eGFR 60 to < 90). Overall, 57% of the subjects had T2DM, 42% had HF (65% were NYHA Class II), 25% 
had a prior MI and 97% had hypertension. Some differences between the starting dose groups were noted 
in baseline characteristics. The proportion of subjects with Stage 4 CKD or worse (43% in Dose Group 1 
and 46% in Dose Group 2), time since CKD diagnosis (median of 3 years in Dose Group 1 and 2 years in

Dose Group 2), proportion of subjects with history of MI 21%  in dose Group 1 and 27%  in Dose Group 
2 and time since diagnosis of MI (median of 8 years in Dose Group 1, and 2 years in Dose Group 2). 
Of the 243 subjects enrolled in Part A, 121 (50%) either did not complete Part A or did not have a Part A 
baseline serum potassium ≥ 5.5mEq/L and were therefore not eligible for Part B. Of the remaining 122 
subjects, 110 (90%) met the criteria for having responded to RLY5016 during Part A. Three of the 110 
elected not to participate in Part B; 107 subjects were randomised in Part B 52 to placebo and 55 to 
continue RLY5016. Of the 107 subjects in the Part B ITT population, 70% overall; 58% of the placebo 
group and 82% of the RLY5016 group completed the 8 weeks of dosing in Part B; 32 subjects 30% 
overall; 42% of the placebo group and 18% of the RLY5016 group withdrew early from Part B.  
The placebo and RLY5016 groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. Of the 107 
subjects who participated in Part B, 54% were male and 100% were white. The median age was 65 years 
(range 32 to 80); 79% were enrolled in Eastern Europe/non-EU countries, 17% were enrolled in EU 
countries and 4% were enrolled in the US. Based on eGFR  41% of the Part B subjects had Stage 4 CKD 
or worse (eGFR < 30), 27% had Stage 3b CKD (eGFR 30 to < 45), 21% had Stage 3a CKD (eGFR 45 to 
<60) and 11% had Stage 2 CKD (eGFR 60 to < 90). Overall, 63% of the subjects had T2DM, 46% had HF 
(65% were NYHA Class II), 30% had a prior MI and 97% had hypertension.

The study was conducted between 20 February 2013 (first subject enrolled) to 06 August 2013 (last 
subject completed last study visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted at 71 centers in Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, 
Serbia, Slovenia, Ukraine, and United States from February to August 2013. 
Baseline data 
Part A: Eligible subjects were 18 –  80 years of age, had CKD (with eGFR ≥  15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and < 60 
mL/min/1.73m2, calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) or 
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation and based on the local laboratory serum 
creatinine) and were receiving a stable dose of at least one RAASi (angiotensin-converting- enzyme 
inhibitor [ACEI], angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] or aldosterone antagonist [AA]) for at least 28 
days prior to screening. At the beginning of the study (i.e., to be eligible for Part A), subjects were 
required to be hyperkalaemic as evidenced by a screening serum potassium that was 5.1 to < 6.5 mEq/L 
(average of two values assessed by local laboratory). Females of child-bearing potential must have been 
non-lactating, must have had a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and must have used a highly 
effective form of contraception for at least 3 months before RLY5016 for Oral Suspension administration, 
during the study and for 1 month after study completion. All subjects provided written informed consent 
prior to participation in the study. 
Part B: To be eligible for Part B, subjects had to meet all of the following: (1) baseline serum potassium 
(central laboratory) at the beginning of Part A ≥  5.5 mEq/L, (2) completed the 4 weeks of dosing with 
RLY5016 for Oral Suspension in Part A, (3) serum potassium (local laboratory) at the Part A Week 4 visit 
in target range for Part A (≥  3.8 mEq/L and < 5.1 mEq/L), (4) receiving RLY5016 for Oral Suspension at 
a dose of 8.4 g/day to 50.4 g/day patiromer at the Part A Week 4 visit, and (5) still receiving treatment

Part A Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results  
The mean (standard error [SE]) change in serum potassium from Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4 
was -1.01 (0.031) mEq/L (95% CI: [-1.07, -0.95]); this mean reduction in serum potassium was 
statistically significantly different from zero (p < 0.001).  This result satisfied criteria established with the 
FDA for the primary efficacy result to be considered pivotal (reduction from baseline in serum potassium 
of at least 0.7 mEq/L with p-value < 0.05). The mean change from baseline in serum potassium at 
Week 4 in Dose Group 1 (i.e., screening serum potassium of 5.1 to < 5.5 mEq/L) was -0.65 mEq/L (95% 
CI: [-0.74, -0.55]) and the mean change from baseline in serum potassium in Dose Group 2 (i.e., 
screening serum potassium of 5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/L) was -1.23 mEq/L (95% CI: [-1.31, -1.16]).

Part A Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results  
The proportion of subjects with a serum potassium level in the Part A target range of 3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L 
at Week 4 was 76% (95% CI: [70%, 81%]).  Similar percentages were observed in each starting dose 
group (Dose Group 1:  74%; 95% CI: [65%, 82%]; Dose Group 2:  77%; 95% CI:  [70%, 83%]). 
Part A Mean Serum Potassium over Time   
Examination of mean serum potassium over time during Part A showed an overall mean change from 
baseline in serum potassium of -0.45 mEq/L by the Day 3 visit (i.e., approximately 48 hours after the 
start of dosing with RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension).  For subjects in starting Dose Group 1, mean 
serum potassium was brought into the range of 3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L at Day 3 (i.e., approximately 
48 hours after the start of dosing), with mean serum potassium stabilizing within 2 weeks.  For subjects 
in starting Dose Group 2, mean serum potassium was brought into the range of 3.8 to < 5.1 mEq/L by 
Week 1, with the mean serum potassium stabilizing by Week 3.

A significant result on the primary endpoint provides evidence that treatment with RLY5016 is beneficial 
in maintain serum plasma levels in responding patients. However, because of the design (with 
measurements not available after serum potassium goes outside the range 3.8 to < 5.5 mEq/L) the 
estimates of the size of the benefit are not considered fully reliable and should be treated with caution.  
Part B Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results  
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 53/73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These secondary endpoints are more in line with the trial design (where patients were discontinued once 
serum potassium control was lost), and are considered to more accurately reflect the size of the 
treatment benefit. Additional analyses which evaluate the proportion of patients maintained within the 
acceptable range are required (three patients were over-treated, so fell below the lower bound of the 3.8 
to < 5.5 mEq/L range and were forced to discontinue treatment, but they count as successes here).  
Serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L at any time:  The estimated proportion of subjects with a serum 
potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L at any time during the 8 weeks of Part B was 60% in the placebo group (95% CI 
of [47%, 74%]) and 15% in the RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension group (95% CI of [6%, 24%]); the 
estimated difference in percentages (placebo minus RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension) was 45% 
(95% CI of [29%, 61%]) and was statistically significant (p < 0.001).   
Serum potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L at any time:  As noted above, subjects were eligible for Part B if the Part A 
Baseline serum potassium was ≥ 5.5 mEq/L.  The estimated proportion of subjects with a serum 
potassium ≥ 5.1 mEq/L at any time during the 8 weeks of Part B was 91% in the placebo group (95% CI 
of [83%, 99%]) and 43% in the RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension group (95% CI of [30%, 56%]); 
the estimated difference in percentages (placebo minus RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension) was 48% 
(95% CI of [33%, 63%]) and was statistically significant (p < 0.001). 
Part B Time to Recurrent Hyperkalaemia 
A time-to-event analysis was performed of the time to recurrent hyperkalaemia, defined to reflect the two 
threshold potassium levels that allowed for interventions to lower serum potassium during the first and 
second 4 weeks of Part B (i.e., serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L during Weeks 1 to 4 and serum potassium 
≥ 5.1 mEq/L during Weeks 5 to 8). The estimated proportion with recurrent hyperkalaemia in the placebo 
group was higher than the estimated proportion in the RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension group within 
the first week of Part B and the difference between the treatment group proportions increased with time 
over Part B.   
Study RLY5026-205 
As described in section 2.5.1, study RLY5016-205 was a 1-year, open-label, randomized, Phase 2, dose 
ranging, efficacy and safety study in which 304 subjects with CKD and hyperkalaemia received RLY5016 
Powder for Oral Suspension. In addition to the main dose ranging investigation purpose, several efficacy 
parameters were investigated. The study had two treatment periods:  a Treatment Initiation Period for 
8 weeks,  followed by a Long-term Maintenance Period for an additional 44 weeks, allowing treatment 
with  RLY5016  Powder  for  Oral  Suspension  for  up  to  a  total  of  1 year.  The  main  efficacy  results  are 
described below. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results: The mean change from baseline in serum potassium at Week 4 (or 
prior  to  dose  titration)  was  statistically  significant  for  all  starting  dose  groups  within  both  strata 
(p < 0.001).    The  LS  mean  (SE)  change  at  Week 4  overall  in  Stratum  1  was  -0.47 (0.039)  mEq/L 
(-0.35,  -0.51,  and  -0.55 mEq/L  for  the  8.4,  16.8  and  25.2 g/day  patiromer  starting  dose  groups, 
respectively),  and  the  LS  mean  (SE)  change  overall  in  Stratum 2  was  -0.92 (0.075)  mEq/L 
(-0.87,  -0.97,  -0.92 mEq/L  for  the  16.8,  25.2  and  33.6 g/day  patiromer  starting  dose  groups, 
respectively).   
Serum Potassium throughout the Study: Treatment Initiation Period (8 weeks): Mean decreases in serum 
potassium from baseline to all time points during the Treatment Initiation Period (regardless of titration) 
were observed for each starting dose group within both strata, including at Day 3 following administration 
of approximately four doses of RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension.  Throughout the entire Treatment 
Initiation  Period,  the  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  in  Stratum 2  (which  had  higher  baseline  serum

potassium  levels)  consistently  were  larger  than  those  in  Stratum 1.    The  range  of  the  LS  mean  (SE) 
change  from  baseline  overall  for  Stratum 2  was  -0.59 (0.048) mEq/L  (Day 3)  to  -1.14 (0.051) mEq/L 
(Week 5)  and  for  Stratum 1  was  -0.29 (0.028) mEq/L  (Day 3)  to  -0.66 (0.027) mEq/L  (Week 5).    At 
Week 4, the proportions of Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 subjects with serum potassium within the range of 
4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L  were  85.4%  and  72.6%,  respectively;  at  Week 8,  the  proportions  were  89.1%  and 
82.9%, respectively. 
Long-Term  Maintenance  Period  (44  weeks):    Regardless  of  stratum  or  starting  dose,  mean  serum 
potassium values were decreased from baseline at every time point during the Long-Term Maintenance 
Period.  For both Stratum 1 and Stratum 2, the mean serum potassium level at all time-points during the 
Long-Term  Maintenance  Period  was  approximately  4.6  mEq/L,  representing  a  mean  decrease  from 
baseline of approximately 0.50 mEq/L in Stratum 1 and a mean decrease from baseline of approximately 
1.00 mEq/L in Stratum 2.  At Week 28, the proportions of Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 subjects with serum 
potassium within the range of 3.8 to 5.0 mEq/L were 89.0% and 95.1%, respectively; at Week 52, the 
proportions were 85.5% and 89.8%, respectively. 
Post-Treatment Follow-up: Serum potassium values started to increase after treatment with RLY5016 
Powder for Oral Suspension was discontinued.  At Days 3 and 7 of the Follow-up Period the mean (SD) 
change from the end of treatment with RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension was 0.22 (0.453) mEq/L 
(N = 163)  and  0.29 (0.503) mEq/L  (N = 154),  respectively, 
for  subjects 
in  Stratum 1  and 
0.29 (0.564) mEq/L (N = 58) and 0.46 (0.540) mEq/L (N = 57), respectively, for subjects in Stratum 2.

Design 
This was a single-blind study in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
(with estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 and < 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2) receiving a stable dose of at least one renin angiotensin 
aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi). At the beginning of the study, subjects 
were required to be hyperkalemic with a screening serum potassium of 5.1 to < 
6.5 mEq/L. The study consisted of two sequential parts: 
Part A was an open non-randomised 4-week treatment phase designed to 
evaluate the ability of RLY5016 to achieve a clinically meaningful reduction in 
serum potassium levels in subjects with hyperkalaemia due to chronic kidney 
disease.  
Part B, was a randomised, 8-week placebo-controlled, treatment withdrawal 
phase designed to evaluate the effect of withdrawing RLY5016 on serum 
potassium control, to assess whether RLY5016 prevented the recurrence of 
hyperkalaemia thereby assessing the need for chronic treatment.

Notes 
The study was almost entirely based on measurements of serum potassium, 
degrees of hyperkalaemia and hypokalaemia at various time points and 
proportion of patients experiencing them. Thus the endpoints are derivatives 
of one another. Neither urinary nor faecal potassium excretion was studied 
and levels of other important physiological ions were studied as safety 
endpoints.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Clinical studies in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of the pooled data from Study RLY5016-301 and Study RLY5016-205 were performed 
for the following: age (< 65 years old and ≥ 65 years old), gender, geographic region (US/EU countries 
and Non-EU countries), baseline body mass index (BMI) (< 30 kg/m2 and ≥ 30 kg/m2), baseline eGFR 
(< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2  and  ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2),  presence/absence  of  heart  failure,  presence  of 
diabetes  mellitus  and  RAASi  medications  at  baseline  (1 medication  and  > 1 medication).    Subgroup 
analyses showed that in all of these subgroups, serum potassium decreased statistically significantly from 
baseline, with results similar to those seen for the overall population.   
Supportive studies 
Healthy Volunteer Studies 
Study  RLY5016-101:  First-in-human,  Phase  1,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group,  single-  and  multiple-dose  escalation  study  of  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  RLY5016  in 
healthy adult volunteers. Subjects were healthy adult males or females without a history of significant 
medical disease, 18 to 55 years of age, with screening body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 29 kg/m2, 
serum potassium level > 4.0 and ≤ 5.0 mEq/L, and serum magnesium, calcium, and sodium levels within 
normal limits. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in which 6 of 8 subjects 
per group received RLY5016 (1 g, 5 g, 10 g, or 20 g per dose) orally in suspension, and 2 of 8 subjects per 
group received matching placebo. For each treatment group, a single dose of RLY5016 or placebo was 
administered on Day 1, followed by a 10-day observation and diet adjustment period. RLY5016 or placebo 
was  administered  TID  on  Days  12  through  19  (8  days  total).  At  least  7  days  were  allowed  after 
single-dose administration at a particular dose level before progression to the next higher dose level.

RLY5016 increased potassium excretion, with statistically significant dose-dependent increases in mean 
faecal potassium excretion from baseline in the 5 g RLY5016 (617.2 mg, p = 0.0195), 10 g RLY5016 
(1,069.7 mg, p < 0.0001), and 20 g RLY5016 (1,929.4 mg, p < 0.0001) TID groups compared with the 
placebo  TID  group.  There  was  a  corresponding  decrease  in  urinary  potassium  excretion.  This  normal 
homeostatic mechanism would be expected to maintain serum potassium in healthy volunteers following 
increased  GI  loss  of  potassium.  Accordingly,  the  faecal/urinary  potassium  ratio  also  increased  with 
increasing doses of RLY5016, with significant differences observed in the RLY5016 10 g TID group (p < 
0.01) and 20 g TID group (p < 0.0001) compared with the placebo TID group. No clinically meaningful 
changes  were  apparent  for  urinary  creatinine,  chloride,  sodium,  and  magnesium  excretion  or  faecal 
magnesium and sodium excretion. No dose-related trend was apparent in serum potassium, magnesium, 
sodium, or calcium values.  
Study RLY5016-102: Phase 1, open-label, multiple-dose crossover study to evaluate the pharmacology, 
safety, and tolerability of three RLY5016 dosing regimens in 12 healthy subjects. Subjects were adult 
males or females without a history of significant medical disease, 18 to 55 years of age, with screening 
BMI between 19 and 29 kg/m2, serum potassium level > 4.0 and ≤ 5.0 mEq/L, and serum magnesium, 
calcium,  and  sodium  levels  within  normal  limits.  Subjects  were  admitted  to  the  clinic  on  Day  -1  and 
remained  in  the  clinic  until  discharge on  Day  23.  Subjects  participated  in  a  baseline  period  of  4  days 
during which they received a controlled diet. Each subject was then randomized to 1 of 6 crossover dosing 
sequences: ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, or CBA (A = TID, B = BID, and C = QD dosing). RLY5016 was 
administered orally as an aqueous suspension of 30 g QD for 6 days, 15 g BID for 6 days, and 10 g TID 
for  6  days,  for  a  total  of 18  days.  Subjects  were  required  to  consume  a  diet controlled  for  elemental 
potassium, calcium, sodium, and magnesium for the duration of the study. 
Administration  of  30  g/day  RLY5016  led  to  mean  (±  standard  deviation  [SD])  increases  in  faecal 
potassium excretion of 1,550 (± 519), 1,419 (± 550), and 1283 (± 530) mg/day in the TID, BID, and QD 
dosing  regimens,  respectively.  No  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean  daily  faecal  potassium 
excretion was observed among the TID/BID/QD regimens (p = 0.37). The corresponding, mean (± SD) 
decreases in urinary potassium excretion were 1,440 (± 384), 1,534 (± 295), and 1,438 (± 384) mg/day 
in  the  TID,  BID,  and  QD  dosing  regimens,  respectively;  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  mean 
urinary potassium excretion was observed among the three dosing regimens (p = 0.39). 
Proof-of-Concept Study 
Study RLY5016-201: Phase 2, open-label, multiple dose adaptive-design study to evaluate the PD effects 
of RLY5016 on serum potassium and to assess the safety and tolerability of RLY5016 in haemodialysis 
subjects. The study population consisted of male and female haemodialysis subjects between the ages of 
18  and  70  years,  with  pre-dialysis  serum  potassium  levels  of  at  least  5.5  mEq/L  on  Day  -7  during 
screening and on Day 1 of treatment. The study allowed for an up to 30-day Screening period (Day -30 to 
Day  -1).  On  Day  -8,  eligible  subjects  were  admitted  to  the  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  and  initially 
followed for 7 days without administration of RLY5016 (Days -8 to Day -1). Subjects were required to 
consume a potassium, magnesium, calcium, and sodium-controlled diet for the duration of the study. The 
diet was designed to provide a consistent amount of daily elemental potassium, magnesium, calcium, and 
sodium intake. In the initial (and only) treatment group, RLY5016 (5 g) was administered orally TID for 
7 days (Days 1 to 7). Subjects were discharged on Day 8. 
The  study  initially  planned  to  enrol  12  to  24  subjects,  but  was  terminated  after  the  completion  of  6 
subjects due to difficulties enrolling subjects. Data from these 6 subjects were analysed. Administration 
of RLY5016 15 g/day for 7 days resulted in a mean (± SD) decrease of 0.23 ± 0.33 mEq/L (p = 0.14) in 
pre-dialysis  serum  potassium  concentration  (Day  8  versus  Day  1).  The  change  from  baseline  to 
on-treatment (Days 2 to 8) in mean (± SD) daily serum potassium concentration was -0.40 (± 0.44) 
mEq/L (p = 0.08). The effect of RLY5016 on mean daily serum potassium was not statistically significantly

different whether on dialysis or not on dialysis; however, there was a numerically greater decrease in non 
dialysis  mean  (±  SD)  daily  serum  potassium  change  from  baseline  (-0.45  ±  0.60  mEq/L,  p  =  0.13) 
compared with dialysis days (-0.33 ± 0.43 mEq/L, p = 0.11). The number of days that subjects had serum 
potassium levels in the normal range (≤ 5.5 mEq/L) was greater during the treatment period (67% of 
days) than the baseline period (36% of days). 
Treatment with RLY5016 15 g/day for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in mean (± SD) faecal 
potassium excretion of 359 (± 277) mg/day (p = 0.02). There was also a statistically significant increase 
in mean (± SD) faecal calcium excretion (1252 ± 290 mg/day, p = 0.0001), reflective of the amount of 
calcium intake associated with the study drug. There were no statistically significant differences in faecal 
excretion of sodium, magnesium, or phosphate. 
Time to Onset of Action Study 
Study  RLY5016-103:  Phase  1,  open-label,  single  arm  study  to  evaluate  the  time  to  onset  of  the 
potassium-lowering action of RLY5016 for Oral Suspension, and to evaluate its safety and tolerability in 
subjects with CKD and hyperkalaemia. Subjects were adult males or females 18 to 80 years of age with 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 15 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium of 5.5 to 
6.2 mEq/L, and who were taking at least one RAASi medication. On the same day as Screening (Day R1), 
eligible subjects were admitted to the CRU for a 3-day in-patient diet run-in period (Days R1, R2, and R3). 
During this time, subjects received a controlled diet containing 60 mEq/day potassium and 100 mEq/day 
sodium,  part  of  standard  of  care  for  managing  CKD  patients  with  hyperkalaemia.  The  first  dose  of 
RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension was administered immediately after the baseline blood sample was 
drawn and with the morning meal on Day T1 (Time 0). Subjects received 3 more doses of 8.4 g patiromer 
each with meals at 10, 24, and 34 hours after the initial dose, for a total of four doses. Subjects were 
discharged from the CRU on Day T3 (approximately 24 hours after administration of the last dose) and 
started an out-patient 6-day follow-up period, during which they attended two visits, F1 and F2, in 3 and 
6 days after discharge from the CRU, respectively. 
A total of 27 subjects were enrolled in the diet run-in period and of these, 25 subjects were treated and 
completed  the  study  (2  subjects  had  exclusionary  serum  potassium  results  prior  to  dosing  and  were 
removed).  The  mean  baseline  serum  potassium  level  was  5.93  mEq/L;  68%  of  subjects  had  baseline 
serum potassium levels ≤ 6.0 mEq/L, and the remainder (8 subjects, 32%) had levels > 6.0 mEq/L. All 
subjects  had  a  history  of  CKD,  with  a  mean  duration  of  4.5  years,  and  a  majority  of  subjects  were 
classified  as  either  having  Stage  3  (36%)  or  4  (44%)  CKD.  Onset  of  action  of  RLY5016  for  Oral 
Suspension, which was defined as the earliest time point at which the least squares (LS) mean change 
from baseline serum potassium value was statistically significantly < 0 mEq/L at the given time point and 
at all later time points, was determined to be 7 hours. Administration of four doses of 8.4 g patiromer 
resulted in a statistically significant reduction from baseline in LS mean serum potassium of 0.75 (0.063) 
mEq/L  (p  <  0.001)  at  Hour  48  from  a  Baseline  mean  of  5.93  mEq/L.  After  the  last  dose  of  RLY5016 
Powder for Oral Suspension at Hour 34, mean serum potassium values continued to decline reaching a 
mean (SD) maximal reduction of 0.83 (0.454) mEq/L at Hour 41; by Hour 58 (i.e., 24 hours following the 
last dose), the mean serum potassium had returned to a level similar to that at the time of the last dose 
(i.e., Hour 34) of RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension (mean [SD] serum potassium at Hour 34: 5.28 
[0.373] mEq/L; at Hour 41: 5.11 [0.391] mEq/L; at Hour 58: 5.27 [0.548] mEq/L).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of Veltassa was been demonstrated in five clinical studies of the treatment (three studies) or 
prevention (two studies) of hyperkalaemia in subjects with CKD and/or heart failure.  Treatment duration 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 60/73 
 
 
 
 
ranged from 48 hours to 1 year. The trials enrolled and dosed 734 subjects with multiple common factors 
such as CKD and use of RAASi medications that contribute to hyperkalaemia. Most of the studies were 
single-blind, which can be considered acceptable since plasma potassium measurement is an objective 
measurement and not likely to be influenced by patient or physician knowledge of the given therapy. Most 
studies were placebo-controlled, there are no active-controlled clinical studies. The other main therapies 
for  treatment  of  hyperkalaemia  are  sodium  polystyrene  sulfonate  and  calcium  polystyrene  sulfonate. 
Major limitations of these are tolerability and patient adherence, which limits their use to short durations.  
They are also contraindicated for patients with serum potassium < 5.0 mEq/L. Therefore it can be argued 
that due to the frequent stop and start cycles of drug administration which complicates chronic dosing, it 
would have been difficult to use them as comparators, particularly when evaluating long-term use. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary  and  secondary  outcomes  were  achieved  and  results  were  also  supported  by  sub-population 
analyses. 
Following administration of Veltassa, the onset of action was shown to be within 7 hours, and efficacy was 
persistent with continued dosing through at least 52 weeks, supporting the utility of Veltassa Powder for 
Oral Suspension as a treatment for both acute and chronic hyperkalaemia.  Dosing and dose titration were 
well characterized in these trials and these data support the dosing recommendations for the product 
labelling.  Across the five clinical studies, RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension demonstrated a consistent 
and  reproducible  potassium-lowering  effect  which  enabled  the  majority  of  subjects  to  reach  and/or 
remain  in  the  target  range  with  a  low  risk  of  hypokalaemia.    The  proposed  starting  dose  is  8.4  g 
patiromer, which was the lowest starting dose evaluated in the clinical development program and was 
associated  with  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  decreases  in  serum  potassium  levels.  
Starting treatment at the lowest effective dose, with titration up to 25.2 g/day patiromer, will result in the 
majority of patients achieving serum potassium concentrations in the target range while minimizing the 
risk of hypokalaemia.  The pharmacodynamic profile of RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension supports a 
once daily dosing regimen, which will provide greater convenience for patients and enhance compliance.  
Once daily dosing will also allow flexibility in dosing times while observing a sufficient separation period (3 
hours)  between  RLY5016  Powder  for  Oral  Suspension  and  a  potentially  interacting  concomitant 
medication.  The ability to titrate RLY5016 Powder for Oral Suspension provides the prescribing clinician 
flexibility to individualize dosing to achieve larger or smaller potassium reductions in response to changes 
in the patient’s serum potassium levels.  The early onset of action, together with the persistence of effect 
over the long term, provide the necessary clinical data to support the effective use of RLY5016 Powder for 
Oral Suspension for the treatment of hyperkalaemia in both acute and chronic clinical settings.  
The  ability  of  Veltassa  to  enable  spironolactone  treatment  was  demonstrated  in  a  randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in heart failure patients who were clinically indicated to receive 
aldosterone  antagonist.  Patients  initiated  spironolactone  at  25  mg/day  at  the  same  time  as  their 
randomised treatment, and were up-titrated to 50 mg/day after Day 14  if serum potassium was >3.5 and 
≤ 5.1  mEq/L.  Compared  to  placebo  at  the  end  of  the  28-day  treatment  period,  the  Veltassa  group 
experienced significantly lower serum potassium. Overall, the vast majority (99.4%) of patients in phase 
2  and  3  clinical  studies  were  receiving  RAAS  inhibitor  therapy  at  baseline.  Although  the  applicant 
proposed to reflect the concomitant use of RAASi and Veltassa in the clinical practice in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC, the CHMP did not support this. Instead, the benefit of Veltassa in the patients treated with RAASi 
is described in details in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Veltassa was demonstrated in both types of clinical studies - treatment (three studies) or 
prevention  (two  studies)  of  hyperkalaemia  in  subjects  with  CKD  and/or  heart  failure.    The  dosing 
recommendation is supported by the studies; the once daily dosing is considered acceptable due to the 
need to minimise potential interactions with other medicinal products. Across all clinical studies, Veltassa 
demonstrated  a  consistent  and  reproducible  potassium-lowering  effect  which  enabled  the  majority  of 
subjects to reach and/or remain in the target range with a low risk of hypokalaemia.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical programme for RLY5016 comprises eight studies:  three Phase 1 studies, four Phase 2 studies 
and one two-part Phase 3 study.  In clinical studies in patients with CKD, heart failure or on 
haemodialysis, the duration of administration of study drug ranged from 48 hours to 52 weeks and the 
doses tested ranged from 8.4 to 50.4 g/day patiromer providing a basis for assessing safety across a 
range of doses and for varying durations of use that could be applied to both the acute and chronic clinical 
settings of hyperkalaemia. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 791 subjects participated in the clinical studies with RLY5016 powder for oral suspension.  Of 
these, 734 were exposed to at least one dose of RLY5016. The pooled safety population includes 666 
subjects who received at least one dose of RLY5016 in studies RLY5016 202, RLY5016 204, RLY5016 205 
and RLY5016 301 and 49 subjects who received at least one dose of placebo in study RLY5016 202.  Of 
the 666 subjects, a total of 584 subjects were exposed to RLY5016 for ≥  4 weeks, 361 subjects were 
exposed for ≥  8 weeks, 219 subjects were exposed for ≥  6 months, and 149 subjects were exposed for 
≥  1 year. 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 60.8% 
and 8.3%, respectively, of the pooled safety population receiving RLY5016 for up to 52 weeks, with a 
similar proportion in the treatment and prevention studies populations.  Approximately 20% of subjects 
receiving RLY5016 experienced AEs considered related to study drug, but no SAEs were assessed by 
either the investigator or sponsor as related to the drug.  Number of subjects discontinuing study drug 
due to an AE was relatively low at 9.0%, indicating the therapy was generally well tolerated, including by 
those who were treated for up to 1 year in study RLY5016 205.  These trends were similar in the treatment 
and prevention studies.   
Overall, the most common reported AEs (> 5%) in the pooled studies were constipation, 
hypomagnesaemia and chronic renal failure. Additional AEs reported ≥  2% were diarrhoea, 
hypertension, anaemia, headache, hyperglycaemia, nausea, ventricular extrasystoles, abdominal 
discomfort, flatulence, hypoglycaemia, peripheral oedema, and supraventricular extrasystoles, and these 
AEs tended to be mild to moderate in nature.  Many of the common events in the unpooled studies were 
similar to those observed in the pooled studies, and there were no deaths or reported SAEs in the 
unpooled studies.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The relative proportion of subjects receiving RLY5016 who experienced SAEs was low at 8.3% in the 
pooled safety population.  The System Organ Class (SOC) with the highest proportion of subjects 
reporting at least one SAE was cardiac disorders, 2.4%, and a similar incidence was observed in both the 
treatment and prevention Studies.  The occurrence of cardiac-related SAEs was expected and consistent 
with the background cardiovascular history and risk factors of the studied population.  No SAEs were 
considered related to study drug. There were four SAEs in the gastrointestinal SOC; two subjects 
experienced GI bleeding in the context of gastric ulcers with other predisposing risk factors and these 
events were not considered related to study drug.  In the category of renal disorders, 1.1% of subjects 
experienced an SAE of renal failure chronic and 0.5% of subjects experienced a SAE of renal failure acute.  
The renal disorders SAEs reported were not considered drug-related.   
There were 20 deaths reported in the clinical programme, all occurring in the pooled safety population.  All 
deaths in the study were reviewed and adjudicated by an independent and blinded board.  Nineteen of the 
deaths occurred in subjects receiving/received RLY5016 and a majority (15 subjects) of these deaths 
were adjudicated as cardiovascular in aetiology, with 10 of these deaths categorised as sudden cardiac 
death.  In one death that occurred in a placebo subject in study RLY5016 202, the death was adjudicated 
as sudden cardiac death.  None of the deaths that occurred, including CVS deaths, were considered by the 
SRB as related to hypokalaemia or hyperkalaemia. 
Laboratory findings 
Hypokalaemia occurred in a low frequency in the safety population, with 4.7% of subjects experiencing 
serum potassium values < 3.5 mEq/L and no subjects experienced a serum potassium value < 3.0 mEq/L. 
Changes in other ions such as Ca, Mg and fluoride were also minimal. Overall, in the RLY5016 clinical 
development programme, there was no indication of drug-related cardiac conduction or repolarization 
abnormalities. 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events were analysed by subpopulations of interest including age, sex, BMI, geographic region, 
baseline potassium value, baseline eGFR and history of heart failure, myocardial infarction, or diabetes. 
In general, an increase in the frequency and incidence rate of AEs of interest occurred in subpopulations 
where the underlying condition is associated with an increased risk of those events (e.g., history of heart 
failure or myocardial infarction), confounding the interpretation and relationship with RLY5016. No new 
safety concerns were observed in elderly patients. Children were not included, and the product is 
indicated for adults only. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant has conducted a comprehensive panel of in vitro interaction studies and used them as a 
guide to which substances to study in vivo. Based on the results and due to the mechanism of action, drug 
interactions with oral medications were observed. These have been addressed by separating the dosing of 
these agents by a period of at least 3 hours as recommended in the SmPC. In addition, the SmPC of 
Veltassa has also been updated to include the dosing recommendation about the concomitant 
administration of Veltassa with other medicinal products. This is acceptable to the CHMP.

Assessment report  
Page 63/73 
 
 
 
 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pooled safety population, the AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of RLY5016 occurred in 60 
subjects (9.0%), including 51 subjects (9.3%) treated with RLY5016 in the treatment studies and 9 
subjects (7.6%) treated with RLY5016 in the prevention studies. The overall frequency for any one 
individual event leading to drug discontinuation was low (< 2%). This doesn’t constitute a concern to the 
CHMP. 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing experience in the use of Veltassa, as declared by the applicant. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical development programme for RLY5016 included an evaluation of 791 subjects across eight 
studies including a two-part pivotal phase 3 study. The pooled safety population included 666 subjects 
who received RLY5016 (in studies RLY5016 202, 204, 205 and 301) and 49 subjects who received at least 
one dose of placebo (in study RLY5016 202); this safety population enabled an evaluation of safety in 
durations of treatment from 4 weeks to up to 52 weeks in a population with advanced CKD and heart 
failure and multiple comorbidities.  In addition, a phase 1 study in 25 subjects with CKD and receiving 
RAASi therapy with baseline serum potassium levels from 5.5 to < 6.5 mEq/L provided an opportunity to 
further assess safety including serum potassium levels and AEs that occur in the hours to days following 
initiation of therapy in subjects with more severe hyperkalaemia. Furthermore, the safety evaluation also 
included an independent core ECG laboratory evaluation of ECG changes in studies RLY5016 301 and 
RLY5016 103 and an adjudication of all deaths by an independent SRB.  Thus, the clinical development 
programme for RLY5016 provides a comprehensive evaluation of the safety of administering the drug in 
a diverse range of clinical settings and durations of treatment.  
Overall, Veltassa appears to be well-tolerated in patients with underlying CKD, diabetes and/or heart 
failure, a population with a high burden of comorbidities and high prevalence of hyperkalaemia.  The most 
common AEs (> 5% of subjects) reported in the pooled safety population were constipation, 
hypomagnesaemia and chronic renal failure.  Importantly, the tolerability of the product in subjects with 
hyperkalaemia is underscored by the fact that a high proportion of subjects were able to remain on 
treatment for extended periods of time, as observed in the 52 week study RLY5016 205 (average duration 
of exposure was approximately 9 months).  With treatment, there is a discernible pattern of AEs and 
safety findings across studies that could be considered as ADRs.  These include constipation and 
diarrhoea, which appear to be self-limited and mostly mild in nature, as well as reduced levels of serum 
magnesium, leading to a low AE incidence of hypomagnesaemia. Other AEs of interest that occurred in 
the safety population receiving RLY5016 included cardiac related disorders, renal events and 
hypertension; however these findings are more likely related to underlying comorbid conditions, 
concomitant medications, intercurrent illnesses and progression of these comorbid diseases than a 
drug-related effect.  Cardiac conduction disturbances were reported in a small proportion of subjects; 
however, ECG changes observed were not deemed to be related to hypokalaemia by the SRB and these 
changes likely reflect biological variability in a population who at baseline often had underlying 
derangements in cardiac conduction and underlying heart disease.  An analysis of AEs by subgroup, while 
confounded by the underlying and associated comorbidities, showed that in general no trends were 
observed that suggest a risk profile different in one subgroup versus another.  Deaths that occurred in the 
studies were predominantly cardiovascular in nature, were not considered related to study drug and were 
attributed to underlying cardiovascular conditions or risk factors.  From the safety database all the 
adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.

Conclusion 
The  CHMP  and  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  1.4  (dated  17  May  2017)  is 
acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR cycle with 
the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21/10/2015. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of patiromer sorbitex calcium with active substances contained in 
authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers patiromer sorbitex calcium to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Veltassa (patiromer sorbitex calcium) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hyperkalaemia represents a serious condition that can result in life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias and 
is associated with increased mortality risk. While rare in the healthy individuals with normal renal 
function, the prevalence of hyperkalaemia in patients with renal insufficiency or CKD ranges from 5% to 
50% and increases as renal function declines. Thus, patients most at risk of hyperkalaemia are those with 
compromised renal excretion of potassium, primarily patients with CKD and/or patients being treated 
with drugs that inhibit renal potassium excretion, 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate and calcium polystyrene sulfonate are two cation-exchange resins 
currently approved in the EU for the treatment of hyperkalaemia. They were introduced in the 1950s and 
1960s; however, have not been rigorously studied. There are limited prospective, long-term clinical trial 
data available to understand the safety and efficacy of these agents. These products are not well tolerated 
and their use can be associated with life-threatening side effects including intestinal necrosis. Further, an 
appreciable sodium load can occur with sodium polystyrene sulfonate such that caution is advised when 
sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered to patients who cannot tolerate even a small increase in 
sodium loads. These issues make the administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate for prolonged 
durations of time difficult.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The safety and efficacy of Veltassa were demonstrated in a two-part, single-blind randomised withdrawal 
study  that  evaluated  this  treatment  in  hyperkalaemic  patients  with  chronic  kidney  disease  (CKD)  on 
stable  doses  of  at  least  one  RAAS  inhibitor  (i.e.  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitor  [ACEI], 
angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB] or aldosterone antagonist [AA]). 
In Part A, 243 patients were treated with Veltassa for 4 weeks. Patients with a baseline serum potassium 
of 5.1 mEq/L to <5.5 mEq/L (mmol/L) received a starting dose of 8.4 g patiromer per day (as a divided 
dose) and patients with a baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L received a starting dose 
of 16.8 g patiromer per day (as a divided dose). The dose was titrated, as needed, based on the serum 
potassium level, assessed starting on Day 3 and then at weekly visits to the end of the 4-week treatment 
period, with the aim of maintaining serum potassium in the target range (3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L). The 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 67/73 
 
 
 
 
mean daily doses of Veltassa were 13 g and 21 g in patients with serum potassium of 5.1 to <5.5 mEq/L 
and 5.5 to <6.5 mEq/L, respectively. 
In Part B, 107 patients with a Part A baseline serum potassium of 5.5 mEq/L to <6.5 mEq/L and whose 
serum potassium was in the target range (3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L) at Part A Week 4 and still receiving 
RAAS  inhibitor  treatment  were  randomised  to  continue  Veltassa  or  to  receive  placebo  for  8 weeks  to 
evaluate the effect of withdrawing Veltassa on serum potassium. In patients randomised to Veltassa, the 
mean daily dose was 21 g at the start of Part B and during Part B. 
The Part B primary endpoint was the change in serum potassium from Part B baseline to the earliest visit 
at which the patient’s serum potassium was first outside of the range of 3.8 to <5.5 mEq/L or to Part B 
Week 4 if the patient’s serum potassium remained in the range. 
The potential of Veltassa to enable concomitant RAAS inhibitor treatment was also assessed in part B. 
The effect of treatment with Veltassa for up to 52 weeks was evaluated in an open-label study of 304 
hyperkalaemic patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable doses of a RAAS inhibitor. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The  clinical  development  programme  demonstrated  that  Veltassa  is  effective  in  lowering  serum 
potassium concentrations in patients with hyperkalaemia, mainly due to renal causes. 
Results showed the mean change in serum potassium from Part A Baseline to Part A Week 4 was  1.01 
mEq/L (95% CI: [-1.07, -0.95]); Group 1 0.65 mEq/L (95% CI: [ 0.74,  0.55]) and Group 2 1.23 mEq/L 
(95% CI: [ 1.31,  1.16]). After 4 weeks of treatment 76% (95% CI: 70%, 81%) of patients had a serum 
potassium in the target range of 3.8 mEq/L to <5.1 mEq/L.  
In  part  B  of  the  pivotal  trial  in  patients  who  had  responded  to  Veltassa  the  estimated  proportion  of 
subjects with a serum potassium ≥ 5.5 mEq/L at any time during the 8 weeks of blinded treatment was 
60%  in  the  placebo  group  (95%  CI  of  [47%,  74%])  and  15%  in  the  Veltassa  group  (95%  CI  of 
[6%, 24%]);  the  estimated  difference  in  percentages  (placebo  minus Veltassa)  was  45%  (95%  CI  of 
[29%,  61%]).  This  finding  was  statistically  significant  (p  <0.001)  and  is  also  considered  clinically 
meaningful. 
The potential of Veltassa to enable concomitant RAAS inhibitor treatment was also assessed in part B. 
Fifty-two percent (52%) of subjects receiving placebo discontinued RAAS inhibitor treatment because of 
recurrent hyperkalaemia compared with 5% of subjects treated with Veltassa. This is in details reflected 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC, in order to inform the prescribers about the possibility of concomitant use of 
RAASi with Veltassa. 
The  capacity  to  lower  serum  potassium  levels  was  further  supported  by  the  results  of  a  phase  2 
dose-ranging trial with a long-term maintenance phase. 
In an open-label study with patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes mellitus on stable doses of a RAAS 
inhibitor  the  effect  of  treatment  with  Veltassa  for  up  to  52 weeks  was  evaluated  demonstrating 
maintenance in decreases in serum potassium over 1 year of chronic treatment.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The patients recruited in the clinical programme had chronic kidney disease; therefore the potassium 
lowering effects in cases of hyperkalaemia due to other reasons was not studied. However, considering 
the  mechanism  of  action  of  Veltassa  which  is  not  specific  to  CKD  this  uncertainty  can  be  considered 
negligible. Veltassa was also studied in a limited number of patients with estimated glomerular filtration 
Veltassa 
Assessment report  
Page 68/73 
 
 
 
 
rate  (eGFR)  <15  ml/min/1.73  m2  and  patients  receiving  dialysis  treatment.  Further,  there  is  limited 
experience in patients with serum potassium concentrations greater than 6.5 mmol/L as a precautionary 
measure this is outlined in the SmPC. 
In  the  phase  III  study,  patients  were  dosed  twice  daily,  however,  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  potential 
binding to other oral medications, the advice in the SmPC is to dose once daily, which could potentially 
limit the effect of Veltassa when used in clinical practice.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No major safety concerns were identified. From a safety perspective, the main concern is the binding of 
patiromer to other oral medications, thus limiting their absorption. This concern was sufficiently 
addressed by limiting the administration to once daily and to separate the intake by 3 hours from other 
oral medicinal products as outlined in the SmPC. There is also the risk of alterations in the concentrations 
of other ions such as magnesium (mild to moderate Hypomagnesaemia) and, as Veltassa contains 
calcium, the benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated in patients at risk of hypercalcaemia. This is 
sufficiently described in the product information for the attention of the prescriber. 
The most common side effects are hypomagnesaemia, constipation, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and 
flatulence. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The long-term safety database is limited. In the few patients that were dosed up to a year, efficacy was 
maintained and no safety issues were identified. Patients with a history of bowel obstruction or major 
gastrointestinal surgery, severe gastrointestinal disorders, or swallowing disorders were not included in 
the clinical studies. Gastrointestinal ischaemia, necrosis and/or intestinal perforation have been reported 
with other potassium binders. The benefits and risks of administering Veltassa would therefore need to be 
carefully evaluated in patients with current or history of severe gastrointestinal disorders, before and 
during treatment. These uncertainties are sufficiently addressed with routine risk minimisation measures.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The favourable effects observed with Veltassa are considered important as currently there is an unmet 
need of safe and efficacious treatment for hyperkalaemia. With Veltassa, there is a statistically significant 
and  clinically  meaningful  lowering  of  serum  potassium  levels,  and  on  discontinuation  of  Veltassa,  the 
levels tend to rise again. Although patients recruited in the clinical studies had CKD, which is the major 
reason  for  hyperkalaemia,  similar  effects  of  potassium  lowering  can  be  expected  in  cases  of 
hyperkalaemia due to non-renal causes, based on the mechanism of action of patiromer. The ability to 
control  potassium  levels  long  term  is  particular  considered  an  advantage  in  patients  who  are 
concomitantly  treated  with  RAAS  inhibitors  as  it  may  avoid  their  discontinuation  in  the  context  of 
recurrent hyperkalaemia.  The risks of hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia and GI side effects should be 
considered by the physician when deciding on treatment with Veltassa. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Hyperkalaemia can result in muscle weakness, paralysis, life-threatening effects on cardiac conduction 
(e.g., QRS widening), arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and sudden death and the benefits of 
lowering potassium levels in patients with conditions leading to Hyperkalaemia are to prevent these 
serious conditions.  
Furthermore long term control of serum potassium levels may facilitate concomitant medication needed 
for patients with CKD hypertension, and congestive heart failure. 
These advantages are balanced against the relatively benign safety profile of Veltassa. 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  using  Veltassa  for  the  treatment  of  hyperkalaemia  in  adult  patients  is 
therefore considered positive.

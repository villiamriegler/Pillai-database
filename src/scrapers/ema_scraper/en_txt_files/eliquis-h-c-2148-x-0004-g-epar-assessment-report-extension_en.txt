2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, accounting for approximately one third 
of hospitalizations attributed to cardiac rhythm disturbances. During AF, electrical impulse propagation 
in  the  atria  is  disorganized  and  chaotic,  with  ineffective  mechanical  contraction.  This  results  in 
remodelling  of  atrial  anatomy,  stasis  of  blood  and  activation  of  prothrombotic  blood  constituents, 
leading  to  the  formation  of  thrombus  or  clot.  Fragments  of  clot  can  dislodge  from  such  thrombi  and

embolize  to  the  brain  to  cause  a  stroke,  or  enter  the  systemic  circulation  and  occlude  the  arterial 
circulation of an organ or limb to produce a systolic embolism (SE). An estimated 2.6 million people in 
North America and 4.5 million people in Europe have AF, with increasing prevalence in older age.  
Apart  from  the  symptoms  associated  with  AF,  it  is  the  strong  association  of  AF  with  stroke  that  is  a 
major  source  of  both  mortality  and  of  major  morbidity.  The  risk  of  stroke  is  increased  >5-fold  in 
patients  with  AF;  this  risk  increases  with  age.  More  than  15%  of  all  strokes  are  due  to  AF  and  such 
strokes  are  more  severe  than  strokes  not  associated  with  AF.  Strokes  in  patients  with  AF  are 
associated with a 70% increase in mortality, a 20% increase in the length of hospital stay, and a 40% 
decrease in the rate of return to home because of more severe functional impairment. The outcome of 
such  cardioembolic  strokes  is  poor,  with  a  mortality  rate  of  25%  at  30  days  and  50%  at  1  year.  
Current guidelines recommend stroke prevention treatment for patients with either AF or atrial flutter, 
whether  paroxysmal  or  chronic,  who  have  at  least  one  (CHADS2) 1  risk  factor.    Bleeding  is  the  major 
safety  concern  associated  with  current  therapies  for  stroke  prevention  in  AF.  When  considering 
appropriate  therapy,  clinicians  must  weigh  the  benefits  of  preventing  a  potentially  devastating 
outcome, such as stroke, with the risk of serious haemorrhage. Unfortunately, the risk of stroke and of 
haemorrhage  tends  to  rise  in  parallel,  so  that  those  patients  most  at  risk  for  stroke  are  also  at 
increased  risk  for  bleeding.    Because  of  the  concern  of  bleeding  associated  with  the  coumarin 
derivatives, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and other agents have been  studied as  alternatives. However a 
meta-analysis and review of these data by Hart and colleagues2 concluded that anti-platelet therapies 
reduced  stroke  in  AF  patients  by  a  modest  20%,  and  were  associated  with  lower  rates  of  major 
bleeding  than  warfarin.  Nonetheless,  warfarin  reduced  stroke  by  ~40%  when  compared  with  anti-
platelet  agents,  but  because  of  the  large  variability  of  stroke  risk  in  this  population,  there  is  still  a 
recognised unmet need for antithrombotic agents that are more efficacious than ASA and that are safer 
or more easily administered than adjusted-dose warfarin. 
The  ACC/AHA/ESC  2006  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of  Patients  with  Atrial  Fibrillation 
recommended that patients with a CHADS2 score of 2 or more be treated with warfarin (International 
Normalized Ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0). For those with a CHADS2 score of 1, recommended treatment was 
either ASA (81 to 325 mg daily) or warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0). The American College of Chest Physicians 
published practice guidelines in 2008 that were in substantial agreement with the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 
guidelines,  but  with  a  preference  of  warfarin  over  ASA  for  patients  whose  CHADS2  score  was  1.  The 
most  recent  ESC  “Guidelines  for  the  management  of  AF”  (2010)  used  a  slightly  different  risk  factor 
score (CHA2DS2-VASC) that includes female gender, vascular disease and age 65 to 74 as risk factors. 
Using this approach, they recommended oral anticoagulation with either warfarin/VKA or dabigatran for 
those  whose  score  was  2  or  greater.  For  those  whose  score  was  1,  ASA  (75  to  325  mg  daily)  was 
acceptable,  but  oral  anticoagulation  (as  defined  above)  was  preferred.  The  recently  published  2011 
ACCF/AHA/HRS  Focused  Update  on  the  Management  of  Patients  with  Atrial  Fibrillation  (Updating  the 
2006 Guideline) added the recommendation that “the addition of clopidogrel to ASA to reduce the risk 
of  major  vascular  events,  including  stroke,  might  be  considered  in  patients  with  AF  in  whom  oral 
anticoagulation  with  warfarin  is  considered  unsuitable  due  to  patient  preference  or  the  physician’s 
assessment of the patient’s ability to safely sustain anticoagulation”. In the 2012 focused update of the 
ESC Guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation (published during the assessment), the use of

the CHA2DS2-VASc score was considered better at identifying ‘truly low-risk’ patients with AF and is as 
good as—and possibly better than—scores such as CHADS2 in identifying patients who develop stroke 
and  thromboembolism.  This  guideline  currently  recommends  in  patients  with  a  CHA2DS2-VASc  score 
≥2,  OAC  therapy  with  VKA  or  the  new  oral  anticoagulant  agents  [dabigatran  (anti-thrombin)  or 
rivoroxaban  (anti  Xa)],  unless  contraindicated.  In  patients  with  a  CHA2DS2-VASc  score  of  1,  OAC 
therapy  with  VKA  or  the  new  oral  anticoagulant  agents  should  be  considered  based  upon  an 
assessment of the risk of bleeding complications and patient preferences. 
Eliquis  2.5  mg  film-coated  tablets  have  been  approved  in  the  European  Union  for  the  prevention  of 
venous  thromboembolic  events  (VTE)  in  adult  patients  who  have  undergone  elective  hip  or  knee 
replacement  surgery  through  centralised  procedure  on  18th  May  2011.  Currently  an  Extension 
Application is submitted for the addition of Eliquis 5 mg film-coated tablets in order to support a new 
proposed indication, grouped with a type II variation to add the newly proposed indication and a type 
IB variation to add a pack size of 168 tablets for Eliquis 2.5 mg film-coated tablets. 
In the Extension Application the MAH cross reference to quality, non-clinical and pharmacokinetic data 
submitted  previously  for  Eliquis  2.5  mg  film-coated  tablets.  Therefore  in  this  assessment  report  only 
the  newly  provided  quality,  non-clinical  and  pharmacokinetic  data  for  the  5  mg  strength  have  been 
discussed.  
Apixaban (BMS-562247) is an orally active, direct, selective inhibitor of the coagulation factor Xa (FXa) 
that  reversibly  binds  directly  to  the  active  site  of  FXa,  and  exerts  anticoagulant  and  antithrombotic 
effects  by  diminishing  the  conversion  of  prothrombin  to  thrombin.  As  the  common  mediator  of  both 
extrinsic  and  intrinsic  activation  of  coagulation,  FXa  is  the  sole  physiological  mediator  of  thrombin 
formation. Thrombin, through its actions on fibrin formation and platelet activation, is a key mediator 
of thrombosis in both the venous and arterial circulation. Inhibition of thrombin generation, therefore, 
produces  antithrombotic  effects  under  a  variety  of  pathological  conditions.  Accordingly,  apixaban  is 
being developed for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of thrombotic diseases.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Eliquis 5 mg film-coated tablet contains 5 mg of apixaban active substance.  The tablet is a pink, oval 
shaped, biconvex film-coated tablets with “894” debossed on one side and “5” on the other side. It is 
presented in PVC/PVDC blisters of 14, 20, 56, 60, 100, 168 or 200 film-coated tablets in cartons. 
The full list of ingredients is defined in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process,  controls  and  manufacturing  sites  have  already  been 
approved  in  conjunction  with  the  2.5  mg  tablets,  EU/1/11/691/001-005  and  no  new  information  is 
added.  Therefore  it  is  acceptable  that  no  further  assessment  or  discussion  concerning  the  drug 
substance has been provided in the context of the present line extension application. 
It is noted that for the calculation of safe levels of impurities in this dossier a maximum daily dose 10 
mg has been considered, covering both the recommended oral dose of 2.5 mg twice daily and also the 
maximum daily dose for Eliquis 5 mg for the new indication.

2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
It is noted that with the present Line Extension application quality information that is specific to 5 mg 
strength was provided including application of two NIR methods to perform on-line (pre-blending) and 
at-line  (tabletting)  testing  of  Eliquis  5  mg  uncoated  (core)  tablets  for  assay  (potency)  and  content 
uniformity  in  support  of  the  RTRT  at  the  two  finished  product  manufacturing  sites,  Humacao,  Puerto 
Rico,  USA  and  Mount  Vernon,  Indiana,  USA.  It  is  also  noted  that  with  the  recent  Type  II  variation 
EMEA/H/C/002148/II/003/G  the  initially  proposed  NIR  method  for  releasing  apixaban  tablets  2.5  mg 
(real time release testing, RTRT) at both finished product manufacturing sites was registered. In view 
of the common granulate for both strengths, all principles also apply for the new 5 mg strength. 
Eliquis  tablets  formulation  and  manufacturing  process  were  designed  to  produce  tablets  with  rapid 
disintegration  and  dissolution  characteristics  ensuring  consistent  and  acceptable  bioavailability. 
Apixaban is non-ionisable; therefore, its aqueous solubility is not affected by changes in pH. It is highly 
soluble  for  doses  up  to  10  mg  and  is  a  low  permeable  compound,  thus,  it  is  classified  as  a  Class  III 
(high solubility/low permeability) compound as per the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS).  
Information on different strengths that were used in the early stages of the  clinical development had 
already  been  presented  at  the  time  of  the  initial  application  form  the  2.5  mg  strength.  The  currently 
approved  marketing  application  for  apixaban  2.5  mg  tablet  included  all  the  relevant  information  on 
formulation and process development of apixaban 5 mg tablet as supporting information. 
Of  all  the  strengths  initially  used,  the  2.5  mg  and  5  mg  were  selected  for  Phase  3  studies  and 
commercialisation.  The  2.5  mg  tablet  have  been  authorised  for  the  prevention  of  venous 
thromboembolism  (VTE).  The  5  mg  strength  is  intended  for  the  new  indication  applied  together  with 
this  application.  Both  2.5  and  5  mg  tablets  are  manufactured  from  a  common  granulate  and 
proportional tablet weight (tablet core). The only difference is concerning the coating agent colour. The 
excipients  used  are  well  known.  The  concentrations  are  usual  for  an  immediate  release  tablet 
formulation and can be considered safe in the proposed concentrations. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The  formulation  and  manufacturing  development  have  been  evaluated  through  the  use  of  design  of 
experiments  and  risk  assessment  respectively  to  identify  the  critical  product  quality  attributes  and 
critical process parameters. 
The  product  critical  quality  attributes  identified  were  appearance,  assay,  content  uniformity  and 
dissolution.  The  active  substance  particle  size  was  determined  as  CQA  as  well  in  view  of  the  low 
content of apixaban in the tablet. 
Proven  acceptable  ranges  (PARs)  for  the  film  coated  tablet  composition  with  regards  to  the 
disintegrant,  surfactant  and  lubricant.  In  addition  PARs  have  been  established  for  the  pre-blending, 
roller compaction and compression steps of the manufacturing process.  
The  quality  of  the  product  is  further  assured  by  the  comprehensive  control  strategy  defined  for  the 
manufacture of Eliquis tablet including process analytical technology (PAT) NIR, as well as conventional 
tests, to control the in-process manufacture. 
It was recognized that because of the targeted low dose for apixaban, content uniformity of the final 
product becomes an important product attribute. Since the drug substance is mixed with most of the 
excipients at the pre-blending, a quantitative on-line NIR method was developed to monitor the mixing 
profile  during  the  pre-blending  unit  operation  and  to  determine  the  blending  endpoint.  For  this  new 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 9/84 
 
 
 
 
strength  the  same  NIR  method  used  at  the  pre-blending  applies  since  the  5mg  tablets  are 
manufactured from an identical blend to that of the existing tablet strength. 
Holding  times  have  been  established  and  the  results  generated  for  three  batches  demonstrate  that 
they did not negatively impact the product quality attributes. 
No additional process development was conducted for the film-coating process step as typical coating 
procedures are followed. 
An at-line NIR method, coupled with tablet weight monitoring throughout the compression run, is also 
applied  on  the  tabletting  step  to  control  the  content  uniformity  of  the  uncoated  tablets.  Tablets  from 
various  batches  were  tested  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  use  of  the  at-line  FT-NIR  spectroscopy 
method for testing the 5 mg core tablets and the application of the large-N sample sizes. The results 
show  a  low %RSD  with  a  very  small  number  of  units  outside  85.0  –  115.5%.  The  comparison  of  the 
results  against  the  reference  method  (HPLC)  demonstrates  an  overall  good  correlation.  It  has  been 
observed that NIR method could show artificially inflated assay results due to the presence of localised 
concentrations  of  apixaban,  suggesting  agglomerates  formation  during  pre-blending.  To  mitigate  this 
risk,  a  screen  milling  step  was  added  to  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  to  further  ensure  a 
uniform blend. The application of the at-line NIR testing of the core tablets allows for more tablets to 
be  tested  compared  to  the  traditional  methods  specified  in  the  harmonised  pharmacopoeial 
specification  for  uniformity  of  dosage  units.  The  proposed  alternative  approach  to  the  uniformity  of 
dosage units test (EP - 2.9.40) has been scientifically establish and set acceptance criteria for content 
uniformity  where  large-N  samples  are  tested.  The  proposed  test  is  based  on  a  one-tiered  counting 
system  and  applying  an  appropriate  quality  level  for  tablets  outside  the  set  Label  Claim  (LC).  The 
content  uniformity  (CU)  results  of  13  batches  of  2.5-mg  and  18  batches  of  5-mg  Eliquis  tablets, 
manufactured  at  commercial  scale  at  both  sites,  underline  that  the  applied  approach  including  NIR 
blend control and Large-N content uniformity testing on the tablet cores ensure manufacture of tablets 
showing a high content uniformity determined on tablets representative for the whole batch. NIR assay 
data  on  several  batches  of  the  2.5-mg  and  5-mg  tablets  manufactured  at  commercial  scale  are 
provided  to  demonstrate  the  suitability  of  the  NIR  methods  developed  for  both  strengths  and  thus 
there is no need for parallel testing. 
The proposed control of content uniformity testing in both the blend as well the compression stage of 
manufacture is considered adequate and herewith acceptable. 
The NIR models maintenance is a GMP issue. Nevertheless, it is expected that changes outside of the 
scope of the NIRS procedure will be submitted via an appropriate variation. 
This grouped application that includes the line extension also includes a Type IB variation to add a new 
pack size of 168 film-coated tablets (12 blisters of 14 film-coated tablets each) for Eliquis 2.5 mg film-
coated tablets. 
Adventitious agents 
Lactose  used  in  the  manufacture  of  tablets  is  of  animal  origin  (bovine  milk).  Statements  from  the 
suppliers and finished product manufacturer in relation to the quality of lactose confirm that all lactose 
used  complies  with  EMEA/410/41/00/01  Rev.2  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  Animal  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents via Human and Veterinary Medicinal Products”.

Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process was described in the original submission and comprises the following main 
steps:  blending,  granulation,  blending,  tabletting,  film-coating  and  packaging.  A  flow-chart  including 
in-process controls is provided. 
The  validation  strategy  consisted  of  manufacture  of  three  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  of 
Eliquis  5  mg  coated tablets  at  the  Humacao  site.  The  in-process  controls  that were  monitored  during 
the  execution  of  the  validation  exercise  were:  pre-blend  active  substance  homogeneity,  roller 
compaction  ribbon  density  and  ribbon  thickness,  tablet  core  weight  and  hardness  and  coated  tablet 
weight gain. In addition to the in-process controls, for the validation batches the final blend uniformity 
was  determined  by  NIR.  All  validation  results  were  in  accordance  with  the  set  acceptance  criteria. 
Finally, batch analysis results on the coated tablets according to the release specifications are listed for 
two coating loads sampled at each three locations. All results met the set requirements.  
The  process  validation  protocol  for  Eliquis  5  mg  tablets  at  the  new  site  (BMS  Mount  Vernon)  at  the 
proposed scale is also considered adequate. 
It can be concluded that the validation is satisfactory, all the in-process control criteria were met, all 
the validation testing complied with the pre-established acceptance criteria, and the release testing of 
the batches were in compliance with the predetermined specifications and quality attributes. 
Due  to  the  use  of  NIR  (as  PAT)  and  RTR  for  the  manufacturing  of  the  drug  product,  the  proposed 
finished product manufacturing site (Mount Vernon, USA) will be inspected post-approval in the scope 
of the planned re-inspection. 
Product specification 
The same drug product specifications are applied for the 5 mg tablets as finalized in Type II variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/00002148/II/0003/G for the 2.5 mg tablets. 
The  release  and  shelf-life  specifications  include  tests  and  limits  for  appearance  (visual),  identification 
(Raman,  IR,  HPLC,  at  release  only),  assay  (by  approved  Real  Time  Release  testing  (NIR  and  tablet 
weight)  or  HPLC  if  tested),  uniformity  of  dosage  units/  content  uniformity  (by  approved  Real  Time 
Release  testing  (NIR)  or  HPLC  if  tested,  HPLC  at  release),  disintegration  (Ph.  Eur.,  at  release  only), 
impurities/degradants  (HPLC,  stability  only),  dissolution  (HPLC,  stability  only)  and  microbial  limit  test 
(Ph. Eur., not routinely). 
A correlation between the particle size of the drug substance and dissolution rate of apixaban has been 
established.  Based  on  this  relationship,  the  specification  for  the particle  size of  the  drug  substance is 
proposed as a surrogate for dissolution testing and therefore the specification does not include a test 
for dissolution.  
Based  on  the  evidence  of  stability  of  apixaban,  the  control  of  impurities  in  the  drug  substance  is 
considered sufficient to ensure the quality of the drug product at release because the impurity content 
of the drug product comes only from process-related impurities contained in the drug substance. Thus, 
the proposal not to test for impurities/degradants for batch release is considered justified. 
Furthermore, due to microbial tests results of the long-term stability batches and low water activity of 
Eliquis film-coated tablets, the tablets are not susceptible to microbial growth. Batches are proposed to 
be  tested  on  a  skip-lot  basis  (one  lot  once  a  year  or  every  ten  batches,  whichever  is  sooner)  for 
microbial contamination.

Batch  analysis  data  for  Eliquis  5  mg  tablets  were  available  from  two  production  scale  batches  from 
Mount Vernon site and three production scale batches from BMS Humacao site. The tablets have been 
analysed according to both conventional finished product tests (HPLC assay, HPLC content uniformity) 
and RTRT tests (based on core tablets, NIR assay and NIR content uniformity). In addition results from  
a large number of batches from both strengths were also presented. Based on the comparative results 
it  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  applied  RTR  tests  could  replace  the  conventional  finished  product 
tests based on HPLC.  
All  results  on  other  parameters  like  disintegration,  dissolution  and  impurities  were  satisfactory  and 
meeting the set requirements. No differences between the two manufacturing sites could be observed.  
The assay results obtained by HPLC (film-coated tablets) and by NIR (uncoated core tablets, large (N) 
– 150 to 160) are very similar.  
The dissolution results are satisfactory and the levels found for the impurities are very low. 
The batch analysis data demonstrate that the manufacturing process, both at the Humacao as well as 
the Mount Vernon site, is well under control. 
Stability of the product 
Three  batches  of  active  substance  were  used  to  prepare  three  batches  of  Eliquis  5  mg  film-coated 
tablet.  All  batches  were  made  using  a  site  and  process  representative  of  the  proposed  commercial 
process. The stability protocol includes testing for all three batches packaged in PVC/PVDC blisters and 
HDPE  bottles.  The  PVC/PVDC  blister  represents  the  worst  case  for  water  and  oxygen  permeation. 
Therefore,  the  results  from  this  package  represent  the  worst  case  for  microbial  counts  and  are 
applicable  to  all  packages.  The  tablets  have  been  stored  for  36  months  under  three  long  term 
conditions (5°C, 25°C/60%RH and 30°C/75% RH) and for 6 months under accelerated 40°C/75%RH. 
Appearance,  HPLC  identification  (only  initially),  KF  water  content,  dissolution  +  HPLC/UV  detection, 
HPLC assay, HPLC impurity/degradants, microbial limit tests (including specified organisms), hardness 
and  disintegration.  During  the  36  months  studies  in  PVC/PVDC  blisters  or  HDPE  bottles  at  the  3  long 
term conditions and after  6 months accelerated study,  no changes for  appearance, assay, impurities, 
dissolution, hardness, disintegration, and microbial content have been seen. A slight increase in water 
content  values  was  observed  for  the  tablets  packaged  in  PVC/PVDC  blisters.  However,  there  was  no 
impact on any other attributes. 
In  addition,  one  batch  was  packaged  in  an  in-process  bulk  container  and  tested  after  storage  at 
30°C/65%RH through 6 months.  
Stress study 
Stress  conditions  (50°C),  photostability,  freeze-thaw  cycling  and  bulk  stability  studies  have  been 
performed. One batch of apixaban tablets, for each package type, was exposed to the stress condition 
of  50°C.  One  batch  of  tablets  placed  in  a  single  layer  in  an  open  petri  dish  was  exposed  to 
25°C/60%RH for 12 months or 40°C/75%RH for 6 months. One batch of tablets in the 60-count HDPE 
bottle was exposed to seven freeze-thaw cycles. Photostability studies were conducted as per ICH Q1B. 
In  addition,  one  batch  of  tablets  (equivalent  to  10%  of  the  anticipated  amount  packaged  for 
commercial  manufacturing)  placed  in  an  in-process  bulk  container  was  also  placed  on  stability  at 
30°C/65%RH through 6 months. 
The product when stored in PVC/PVDC blisters or HDPE bottles for 3 months at 50°C was stable with 
essentially  no  change  from  initial  observed  in  potency,  impurities,  hardness,  disintegration  time, 
appearance,  or  dissolution.  The  freeze/thaw  cycling,  open-dish,  and  high-temperature  stress  studies

Based on the photostability data collected the product is considered not sensitive to light.  
The overall stability results support the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions.   
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Eliquis 5 mg film-coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance 
with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Information on development, manufacture and control of the 
drug substances has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The quality of the active substances is 
considered  sufficiently  described  and  adequately  supported  by  data.  Sufficient  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  product 
has been presented. Since the new 5 mg strength is manufactured from the same identical blend, the 
already  established  PARs  apply  also  for  5  mg  tablets.  The  same  PAT  tools  (NIR)  are  used  for  the 
monitoring of the pre-blending step for both strengths.  
RTRT  is  proposed  for  the  assay  and  content  uniformity  of  the  tablets.  The  NIR  method  together  with 
tablet  weight  is  used  for  this  purpose  has  been  approved  for  the  2.5  mg  strength.  The  method  has 
been satisfactorily validated for the new strength at both the proposed manufacturing sites. The results 
of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics, 
and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform 
performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. The design 
space  is  considered  sufficiently  validated  for  the  proposed  batch  size  range  at  both  the  proposed 
manufacturing  sites.  The  proposed  RTRT  for  content  uniformity  and  assay  is  accepted  and  has  been 
sufficiently supported by data and validation studies. 
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
No  new  pharmacology  studies  were  provided  within  current  application  to  support  the  extension  of 
indications.  Since  both  indications,  new  and  the  previously  approved  one,  are  based  on  the  same 
pharmacodynamic  mechanism,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  there  is  no  need  for  additional 
pharmacology  data.  Therefore,  the  reference  is  made  to  the  assessment  of  initial  marketing 
authorisation  application  (MAA)  for  Eliquis  2.5  mg  film-coated  tablets  and  only  new  information  is 
discussed in the current report.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  only  new  information  provided  consists  of  two  (non-GLP)  in  vitro  studies  showing  an  inhibiting 
effect  of  diltiazem  on  digoxin  efflux  in  Caco-  2  cells  and  in  porcine  kidney-derived  LLC-PK 1  cell 
monolayers. Based on these data it can be concluded that diltiazem is an inhibitor of P-gp.  
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The final report was provided of the definitive juvenile rat toxicology study (GLP) which was ongoing at 
the  time  of  the  assessment  of  the  initial  MAA  for  Eliquis.  In  this  study,  cross-fostered  rat  pups  were 
treated  from  postnatal  day  (PND)  4  to  PND  94.  Tested  doses  were  0,  10,  50  and  600  mg/kg/day. 
Subgroups  were  sacrificed  on  PND  10  (toxicokinetics),  PND21  (coagulation  testing),  PND  94 
(toxicokinetics),  on  PND  21  and  87  (organ  weights,  serum  chemistry,  hematology,  coagulation, 
urinalysis, necropsy, histopathology), or after a recovery period of 1 month (after production of an F2 
generation, organ weights, coagulation, serum chemistry [males], testis histopathology). No apixaban-
related toxicity or changes of F1-generation fertility or mating indices were observed. Apixaban-related 
effects  were  limited  to  mild  prolongations  of  PT  and  aPTT  values  that  were  not  adverse  and  were 
recoverable.  The  no-observed-adverse-effect-level  (NOAEL)  was  600  mg/kg/day  (AUC  during  PND  21 
to  87  respectively  25  and  9  times  human  AUC  at  5  mg  BID)  changes.  Toxicokinetic  data  showed 
decreasing exposure from PND 10 to 87, presumably due to developmental changes (Tmax on PND 10 
was about 2-3 times the Tmax on PND 21). Taking into account the additional information, the CHMP 
agreed not to consider the findings from this study as drug related for the following reasons: all other 
toxicity  signs  observed  in  the  reproductive/developmental  studies  are  related  to  apixaban’s  action  on 
coagulation,  i.e.  its  pharmacodynamic  mechanism  of  action.  From  other  toxicity  studies  provided 
(repeated dose studies, fertility studies, juvenile toxicity studies) there was no evidence of any effects 
on parameters which could be related to female fertility. Based on the overall data set  now available 
the observed slightly decreased mating and fertility indices in offspring of pre/post-natally treated rats 
is  unlikely  to  be  an  apixaban-related  effect.  Based  on  this  conclusion,  the  CHMP  agreed  on  the 
amendments of the SmPC text of sections 5.3 and 4.6. 
2.3.4.  Environmental risk assessment  
A full ERA has already been presented and evaluated for Eliquis 2.5 mg tablets at the time of the initial 
MAA. At that time a complete dossier was submitted, meeting the requirements of the EMA guideline 
on ERA. The ERA concluded that no risk to the environment was anticipated following the use of Eliquis 
2.5 mg tablets. In the current procedure the same, complete ERA dossier has been submitted. Due to 
the  added  indication,  the  environmental  exposure  is  expected  to  increase.  The  MAH  submitted  a 
revised ERA, which was evaluated with respect to the PEC calculations and the result of the revised risk 
quotients. 
Apixaban  (BMS-562247)  is  a  selective,  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  coagulation  factor  Xa  (FXa).  Its  log 
K ow is 1.2 (shake flask), water solubility 38-60 mg/L at 25°C and its K oc 12.2 L/kg (HPLC method; log 
K oc = 1.09). Apixaban is not readily biodegradable. In a water/sediment simulation study (OECD 308), 
half life values of 31.5-41.7 d were found for the water phase and 100-182 d for the whole system, all 
determined  at  20±2°C.  The  toxicity  data  are  summarized  below.  Inhibition  of  activated  sludge 
respiration:  EC50 > 1000 mg/L  and  hence  NOEC > 1000  mg/L.  Aquatic  species:  green  alga  P.

(emergence and development rate; result normalised to 10% o.c.). Using a refined Fpen of 0.01 (57% 
metabolism), PECsurface water was 0.0285 µg/L. No risk following the use of apixaban was anticipated for 
the  sewage  treatment  plant,  surface  water,  groundwater  and  sediment.  The  PBT  (Persistent, 
Bioaccumulative,  Toxic)  assessment  is  summarized  below.  Apixaban  does  not  meet  the  screening 
criterion for B, since log K ow is < 4.5. Based on the  OECD 308 study and the  resulting whole system 
half life values of 100-182 at 20°C, the P criterion is met. Based on the aquatic toxicity data submitted, 
the substance is not T.  
In  conclusion,  apixaban  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  not  PBT,  nor  vPvB  (very  persistent,  very 
bioaccumulative).

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  MAH  submitted  supplemental  data  related  to:  (1)  potential  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with 
diltiazem and (2) the final report of an ongoing juvenile toxicity study. The evidence was provided that 
diltiazem inhibits P-gp.  
No  evidence  of  juvenile  toxicity  was  found  at  systemic  exposure  of  9  –  25  times  human  exposure 
(based on data from adults). Since chronic use of apixaban was already assessed in the initial MAA of 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report

apixaban,  no  new  data  were  considered  necessary  by  the  CHMP  to  support  the  extension  of  the 
treatment  duration  that  was  approved  within  current  application.  The  doses  used  in  the  non-clinical 
toxicity studies provided in the initial dossier resulted in sufficiently high exposure compared to clinical 
exposure. The MAH provided updated overview of exposure factors, based on the new clinical dose of 5 
mg BID. 
The CHMP agreed not to consider the findings from this study as drug related for the following reasons: 
all  other  toxicity  signs  observed  in  the  reproductive/developmental  studies  are  related  to  apixaban’s 
action  on  coagulation,  i.e.  its  pharmacodynamic  mechanism  of  action.  From  other  toxicity  studies 
provided  (repeated  dose  studies,  fertility  studies,  juvenile  toxicity  studies)  there  was  no  evidence  of 
any effects on parameters which could be related to female fertility. Based on the overall data provided 
the  CHMP  believed,  that  the  observed  slightly  decreased  mating  and  fertility  indices  in  off-spring  of 
pre/postnatally treated rats was unlikely to be an apixaban-related effect.  As a consequence, sections 
4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC  were modified. In addition, the juvenile toxicity study was added to section 
5.3 of the SmPC.  
In  addition,  an  updated  ERA  was  provided  within  current  line  extension  application  in  which  the  new 
indication was covered. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From  a  non-clinical  view,  Eliquis  5  mg  tablets  were  considered  approvable  by  the  CHMP.  Cross 
reference  was  made  to  the  information  in  the  assessment  of  the  initial  MAA  for  Eliquis  2.5  mg  film-
coated  tablets.  Based  on  the  additional  juvenile  toxicity  data,  the  CHMP  proposed  amendments  to 
sections 4.6 and 5.3. of the SmPC.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Apixaban  is  a  novel,  orally  active,  selective,  direct,  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  coagulation  factor  Xa 
(FXa),  developed  as  an  anticoagulant.  Factor  Xa  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  coagulation  cascade 
because  it  sits  at  the  junction  of  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  pathways  of  the  coagulation  system. 
Inhibition  of  FXa  is  expected  to  exert  anticoagulant  and  antithrombotic  effects  by  decreasing  the 
conversion of prothrombin to active thrombin, thereby diminishing thrombin-mediated activation of the 
coagulation process, including fibrin formation and platelet activation.  
GCP 
The  clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  applicant 
has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
A  request  for  GCP  inspection  had  been  adopted  for  the  following  clinical  study  CV  185030 
(ARISTOTLE).  The  outcome  of  this  inspection  was  submitted  and  assessed.  No  critical  findings  were 
observed in three inspected sites. In conclusion the CHMP agreed with the inspectors that based on the 
inspections  conducted  in  three  different  sites  the  conduct  of  the  main  clinical  study  ARISTOTLE  is 
considered to be GCP compliant.  
During  the  assessment  of  the  current  application  an  issue  was  raised  concerning  possible  errors  in 
medication  dispensing.  Analysis  of  a  sample  of  labels  (around  20%  of  dispensed  labels)  showed  that 
these  occurred  within  values  that  could  be  expected  in  major  trials.  Sensitivity  analyses  further 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 16/84 
 
 
 
 
 
confirmed  the  robustness  of  the  data.  In  the  analysed  sample  of  labels,  illegible  labels  (after 
dispensing) were read using bar code readers. No medication errors were discovered in most of these 
labels.  This  further  confirms  the  limited  rate of  medication  errors  previously  calculated  in  ARISTOTLE 
(0.03%).  There  was  also  some  concern  whether  monitoring  activities  were  vigilant  enough  to  detect 
the identified medication errors. The MAH submitted the monitoring plan implemented in ARISTOTLE, 
describing  its  frequency  and  the  main  activities  including  source  data  verification  and  drug 
accountability.  The  submitted  analysis  shows  that  most  of  the  incorrect  medication  containers 
dispensed  (46/50)  were  detected  by  monitoring  visits  or  data  queries.  Also  corrective  actions  were 
taken.  Although  no  reference  standard  for  comparison  is  available,  the  submitted  analysis  and 
narratives  are  reassuring.  In  addition,  the  EMA  inspections  of  three of  the  trial  sites  support  that the 
study was GCP compliant. 
Additional concerns were raised with regards to the integrity of the interactive voice response system 
(IVRS),  which  specified  each  container  to  be  dispensed  to  the  patient,  and  on  discrepancies  between 
the trial database and the data collected on the eCRF. In response, the MAH clearly explained that the 
identified discrepancies were isolated events and not part of systematic error. With regard to the IVRS, 
the  MAH  explained  in  sufficient  detail  the  pre-defined  procedures  employed  in  case  manual  changes 
are implemented, the reason such changes were implemented, and the audit trail of such changes. The 
submitted data indicate that these changes were necessary, well documented and not interfering with 
the integrity of the data or the safety of the trial subjects. This response was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data submitted within initial MAA were considered sufficient for the authorisation 
of  the  5  mg  tablet,  as  the  pharmacokinetics  of  both  tablets  were  intensively  investigated  in  the 
submitted phase I-III studies. All studies in the initial MAA  were relevant for  both strengths, and the 
2.5  and  5  mg  tablets  showed  dose  proportionality.  Therefore,  reference  is  made  to  the  information 
assessed within the initial MAA of Eliquis 2.5 mg film-coated tablets and only new information will be 
discussed. 
For the current application the MAH submitted 2 additional PK studies (study CV185029 and CV185074) 
and  updated  the  (pop-pk)  pharmacokinetic  analysis  with  data  of  newly  performed  phase  2/3  studies 
which employed sparse sampling.  
Newly submitted pharmacokinetic studies 
The  following  pharmacology  studies  including population  pharmacokinetics  are  new  in  this  application 
compared to the initial application of the 2.5 mg strength. 
Study  CV185029  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  relative  bioavailability  (BA)  of  the  apixaban  Phase  3 
tablet (2.5 mg) and an oral solution formulation. This study provides additional data showing that the 
extent of absorption of apixaban from the tablet and solution formulation is comparable.

The results of this study did not contribute specifically for the application of the 5mg tablet, but merely 
confirmed the observations already made with regard to the absorption profile of apixaban tablets, as 
Study CV185029 showed that absorption seems not to be dissolution-rate dependent. 
Study  CV185074  provided  an  additional  assessment  of  apixaban  multiple  dose  PK  following 
administration  of  2.5  mg  BID  in  healthy  subjects.  This  study  also  allowed  a  relative  assessment  of 
apixaban  PK  and  rivaroxaban  PK  within  the  same  individual.  The  results  of  the  study  are  used  to 
update  figure  PK16  (assessment  report)  and  in  the  tables  below,  however  they  are  not  separately 
discussed. The results are completely in line with previous pk results for multiple dose administration 
of 2.5 mg BD apixaban in healthy subjects. 
The tables below (Table 3 and 4) are updated with data from studies CV185029 and CV185074. The 
single-  and  multiple  dose  pharmacokinetics  parameters  estimates  of  apixaban  are  not  changed  after 
including these studies.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  summary  of  clinical  pharmacology  data  submitted  to  support  the  registration  of  for  venous 
thromboembolism  prevention  (VTEp)  indication  remains  largely  unchanged,  even  with  the  additional 
new data from the CV185029 study. As such, the interpretation of these findings remains consistent 
with  that  presented  in  the  Clinical  pharmacology  Summary  (CPS)  for  VTEp  indication.  Loss  of 
proportionality at doses  ≥25 mg has little, if any, clinical impact for this indication.  
POP-PK update and update intrinsic factors 
The  MAH  used  sparse  sampling  in  several  newly  submitted  phase  2  and  3  trials  (study  CV185030, 
CV185067, CV185070, and CV185023). A POP-PK analysis was conducted with this new data. Results 
of  this  analysis  indicated  that,  in  general,  the  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  (age,  gender,  body  weight, 
renal function) characterized in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies accounted for the differences in 
exposure  observed  between  the  healthy  Phase  1  subjects  and  patients  with  AF.    In  addition,  patient 
status accounted for a small, 14% reduction in apixaban CL/F. 
Higher apixaban exposures, up to approximately 30%, were observed for intrinsic factors such as age, 
gender, race, or low body weight (≤ 50  kg). Subjects with  AF  who are at a potentially greater risk of 
bleeding (defined as those who meet at least 2 of the following 3 criteria: age ≥ 80 yrs, body  weight 
≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL) may require a lower dose of apixaban (i.e., 2.5 mg BID). It 
was  shown  in  phase  3  trials  that  exposures  in  the  subjects  who  met  the  dose  reduction  criteria  and 
received 2.5 mg BID was slightly lower (~25%) than that of AF subjects treated with apixaban 5 mg 
BID  (daily  median  AUCss  values  of  2703  ng*hr/mL  versus  3603  ng*hr/mL,  respectively).  Therefore, 
this advice of dose reduction is incorporated in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Other important PK updates 
Additionally  the  MAH  included  in  the  clinical  overview  information  with  regard  to  possible  genetic 
polymorphism.  The  MAH  confirmed  and  the  CHMP  agreed  that  genetic  polymorphism  resulting  in 
clinical significant differences in metabolic clearance of apixaban is not likely. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic  data  presented  during  the  original  application  to  support  the  VTEp  indication  are 
also applicable to the current indication. 
Mechanism of action 
Apixaban  is  an  orally  active,  direct,  selective  inhibitor  of  coagulation  factor  Xa  (FXa)  that  reversibly 
binds  directly  to  the  active  site  of  FXa,  and  exerts  anticoagulant  and  antithrombotic  effects  by 
diminishing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. As the common mediator of both extrinsic and 
intrinsic  activation  of  coagulation  FXa  is  the  sole  physiological  mediator  of  thrombin  formation. 
Thrombin,  through  its  actions  on  fibrin  formation  and  platelet  activation,  is  a  key  mediator  of 
thrombosis  in  both  the  venous  and  arterial  circulation.  Inhibition  of  thrombin  generation,  therefore, 
produces  antithrombotic  effects  under  a  variety  of  pathological  conditions.  PD  effects  of  apixaban 
include inhibitory effects on FXa activity and ex vivo thrombin generation as well as the prolongation of 
clotting tests such as PT/INR, aPTT, and mPT. 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 23/84 
 
 
 
 
Primary pharmacology 
For this application, the MAH included one new pharmacodynamic Study CV185066 which provided an 
assessment  of  apixaban  PD  in  paediatric  and  adult  plasma  utilizing  2  different  anti-Xa  assays. 
Presented  data  show  that  the  Rotachrom  chromogenic  (RCC)  anti-Xa  (AXA)  assay  is  not  affected  by 
intrinsic  factor  X  levels.  Although  apixaban  does  not  require  routine  monitoring  of  exposure,  the 
Rotachrom anti-Xa assay may be useful in situations where knowledge of apixaban exposure may help 
to  inform  clinicians  when  taking  decisions.  However  its  use  was  not  implemented  in  the  clinical 
program limiting any recommendation regarding its applicability. 
Based  on  PKK  and  exposure-response  ER  modelling  from  the  pivotal  study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE), 
AXA  activity  and  apixaban  plasma  concentration  are  shown  to  be  highly  correlated  within  and  above 
concentrations achieved following administration of apixaban 2.5 mg and 5 mg BID in AF patients. This 
is in line with data provided in the original MAA for subjects receiving 2.5 mg BID for VTEp indication. 
The model predicts a tight correlation between higher exposure and bleeding, but a lesser correlation 
between higher exposure and efficacy, in the form of prevention of stroke. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No new data since initial MAA were provided.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic  and  pharmacodynamic  data  presented  during  the  original  application  for  the  VTEp 
indication  are  also  relevant  for  the  current  application.  New  data  further  support  the  utility  of 
Rotachrom anti-Xa assay, however, there was limited utilization of this assay in the phase 3 studies.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The initial MAA included sufficient pharmacokinetic data to support the marketing authorisation of the 5 
mg tablet. The PD properties of apixaban are adequately characterized and are in line with those of a 
direct  FXa  inhibitor.  The  Rotachrom  anti-Xa  assay  was  not  used  for  decision-making  in  the  clinical 
program limiting any recommendation regarding its applicability. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
Overview of the two new phase 3 studies to support the proposed indication are included in table E1. 
The phase 2 study CV185067 is discussed under Safety. 
Table E1 Overview of phase 3 clinical studies in AF

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No new dose response studies were provided by the MAH to support this appllication. In the phase 3 
studies, 5 mg BID was the selected dose. For certain patients deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding 
with study drug (e.g., the elderly, small stature, renal impairment), a lower dose of apixaban (2.5 mg 
BID) was used. 
Selection of the 5 mg BID dose of apixaban was based primarily on the Phase 2 dose-ranging study in 
VTEp (CV185010), the Phase 2 study in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treatment (CV185017; 3 months 
treatment  duration),  and  experiences  from  other  anticoagulants  studies  in  this  patient  population.  In 
the Scientific Advice provided by the EMEA in 2005, it was agreed that dose selection for apixaban in 
AF studies could be derived from Phase II studies in prophylaxis and treatment of VTE and that there 
was no need in repeating dose-finding in patients with AF. 
Study  CV185010  (assessed  within  the  original  MAA)  showed  that  all  selected  doses  had  favourable 
efficacy, but the rate of bleeding with the higher doses (10 and 20 mg/day) was similar or higher than 
with enoxaparin/warfarin (Fig E1). 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 25/84 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure E1: Apixaban Phase 2 VTEp after Knee Replacement (CV185010) 
A  dose  of  2.5  mg  BID  was  selected  for  the  VTEp  indication.  In  AF,  where  stroke  is  the  primary 
endpoint,  a  failure  of  efficacy  would  result  in  substantial  morbidity  and  mortality  and  is  thus  a  much 
greater  concern.  This  favoured  the  selection  of  5  mg  BID  dose  as  it  appeared  to  have  increased 
efficacy compared to the 2.5 mg BID dose without a substantial increase in bleeding risk.  
Modified  dose:  Results  of  PK/PD  studies  indicate  that  factors  such  as  renal  function,  age,  and  body 
weight individually have limited effect on apixaban’s exposure, however, combinations of these factors 
could result in clinically significant higher exposures. Accordingly, the Phase 3 program implemented a 
dose  modification  strategy  (2.5  mg  BID)  in  patients  who  fulfilled  any  2  of  the  following  criteria  at 
baseline: Age ≥80 years; body weight ≤60 kg and serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). 
2.5.2.  Main studies  
The two Phase 3 studies were both active-controlled, randomized, multi-national, multi-centre, double-
blind, parallel-group studies with independent, blinded adjudication of efficacy and safety endpoints by 
an external Events Adjudication Committee. The treatment period of each study was to be completed 
after  a  pre-specified  number  of  subjects  (448  subjects  in  CV185030  and  226  subjects  in  CV185048) 
had  a  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  Study  CV185048  also  included  an  optional  Long-Term  Open-label 
Treatment Extension (LTOLE).   
Study CV185030 (ARISTOTLE) 
Methods 
This is a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban versus warfarin (INR 
target  range  2.0  -  3.0)  in  subjects  with  non-valvular  AF  and  at  least  one  additional  risk  factor  for 
stroke.  The  comparator  warfarin  was  well  chosen  since  the  European  Society  of  Cardiology  (ESC) 
clinical  practice  guidelines  for  the  management  of  AF  recommend  VKA  in  AF  patients  with  ≥1  stroke 
risk  factor(s)  provided  there  are  no  contraindications.  For  a  valid  comparison  between  a  new  anti-
coagulant versus VKA, it is important to ensure that patients on VKA spend a relevant time (more than 
60% of the time) in therapeutic range of INR 2-3. Challenges in maintaining an adequate INR level in a 
global  trial  are  acknowledged.  Control  of  INR  for  warfarin  subjects  was  determined  by  using  central 
monitoring  of  INR  measurements.  Methods  described  by  the  MAH  appear  adequate  to  maintain

therapeutic  VKA  levels,  though  only  the  results  can  confirm  their  adequacy.  Rosendaal’s  method3  to 
measure  individual  TTR  (time  in  therapeutic  range)  was  also  employed  in  the  RELY  study  and  is 
acceptable.   
Study Participants  
The ARISTOTLE study included subjects with AF who were eligible for warfarin treatment (VKA naïve or 
experienced subjects). Main inclusion criteria were subjects ≥18 years of age with documented AF or 
atrial flutter, and presenting with at least 1 additional risk  factor for stroke.  Risk factors included the 
following:  age  ≥  75  years;  prior  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack  (TIA)  or  SE;  either  symptomatic 
congestive heart failure within 3 months or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an LV ejection fraction 
(LVEF)  ≤40%;  diabetes  mellitus;  hypertension  requiring  pharmacological  treatment.  Main  exclusion 
criteria included: clinically significant (moderate or severe) mitral stenosis and increased bleeding risk 
that was believed to be a contraindication to oral anticoagulation. The inclusion and exclusion criteria 
used in the study are deemed adequate for AF patients who might benefit from this treatment. 
Treatments 
The dose of apixaban assigned at randomization (5 mg BID or 2.5 mg BID in special populations) was 
to be maintained throughout the study, even in case criteria changed during the study. Study dosage 
of warfarin treatment was based on INR measurements (INR target range 2.0 to 3.0). According to the 
MAH,  a  major  effort  to  train,  track  and  assure  the  quality  of  the  INR  control  in  the  study  was 
undertaken. INRs were measured and collected into a central database in a blinded fashion with point–
of-care  (POC)  devices.  The  protocol  specified  the  collection  of  INRs  on  all  treated  subjects  by  Day  4 
after 
initiation  of  study  drug,  with 
increased 
frequency  during  titration  of  warfarin  (or 
warfarin/placebo),  and  monthly  after  that.  The  POC  devices  would  deliver  true  INR  readings  for  VKA 
patients,  but  would  sham  the  INR  results  for  those  on  apixaban.    INR  control  was  assessed  by  the 
method of Rosendaal and divided into terciles (TTR <2.0, 2.0 - 3.0 and >3.0) and was carried out on 
the  country  level.  Rosendaal’s  method  provides  each  subject  with  an  INR  measurement  every  day, 
either actual or by estimation through linear interpolation. 
The  study  included  3  periods:  (1)  the  screening  period  of  up  to  14  days,  (2)  the  treatment  period 
lasted until the earlier of a subject’s treatment discontinuation or the attainment of approximately 448 
primary efficacy events and (3) the follow-up period lasted until the latter of 30 days after treatment 
discontinuation or the attainment of 448 primary efficacy events. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine if apixaban was non-inferior (NI) to warfarin for the combined 
endpoint  of  stroke  (haemorrhagic,  ischemic  or of  unspecified  type)  or  SE,  in  subjects  with  AF  and  at 
least one additional risk factor for stroke. The key secondary objectives were to determine if apixaban 
was  superior  to  warfarin  for:  the  combined  endpoint  of  stroke  or  SE;  major  bleeding  (International 
Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis [ISTH] criteria); and all-cause death.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of confirmed stroke 
or SE, regardless of whether the subject was receiving treatment at the time of the event during the 
Intended Treatment Period. 
Diagnosis of stroke required non-traumatic, focal neurological deficit lasting at least 24 hours. A retinal 
ischemic event (embolism, infarction) was considered as a stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) 
was  defined  as  a  non-traumatic  abrupt  onset  of  focal  neurological  symptoms  lasting  less  than  24 
hours.  The  study  protocol  recommended  that  a  cerebral  imaging  study  such  as  a  computed 
tomography  (CT)  scan  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  would  be  performed  for  all  suspected 
strokes. Systemic embolism was judged to occur where there was a clinical history consistent with an 
acute  loss  of  blood  flow  to  a  peripheral  artery  (or  arteries),  which  was  supported  by  evidence  of 
embolism from surgical specimens, autopsy, angiography, or other objective testing. 
All  suspected  efficacy  events  were  adjudicated  by  an  independent,  expert  panel  of  physicians 
experienced in adjudication of these types of clinical study endpoints. 
The  endpoints/outcome  of  the  study  was  adequately  chosen,  discussed  and  agreed  on  during  the 
scientific  advise  given    by  the  CHMP.  The  chosen  primary  endpoint  of  stroke/SE  is  also  in  line  with 
recently assessed clinical trials. Since imaging studies were not consistently performed to verify stroke 
or  sub-classify  ischemic  stroke,  the  results  might  be  influenced  by  the  judgment  of  the  study 
investigator. However, considering the double-blind design, the influence on  study outcome would be 
limited. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  apixaban  or  warfarin.  All  subjects  received 
matching placebo (double-dummy design). 
Statistical methods and sample size 
Populations for Statistical Analyses.  
Randomized Population: includes all subjects who signed informed consent and were randomized. In 
this population, subjects are categorized to the group to which they were assigned by the automated 
voice response system (As Randomized). 
Evaluable  Population: subset of Randomized Population, excluding full (if deviation occurred prior to 
randomization)  or  partial data  (if  deviation  occurred  after  randomization)  from  subjects  with  protocol 
deviations  expected  to  affect  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint.  If  a  deviation  occurred  after 
randomization, then the data up to the time of the deviation was included in the Evaluable data set. In 
this population subjects are categorized according to the As Randomized group. This population is used 
for sensitivity analyses associated with NI assessments in the CV185030 study. 
Choice of NI margin. The following two analyses were performed; NI of apixaban relative to warfarin 
was demonstrated: 
1.  If  the  upper  bound  of  the  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  risk  reduction  (RR)  was  less 
than 1.38. 
2. If the upper bound of the two-sided 99% CI for RR was less than 1.44. 
The 4 key objectives of the study were tested following a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy at 
a significance level adjusted for the formal interim test for superiority. The adjustment was small and 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 28/84 
 
 
 
 
did  not  impact  the  results.  Overall  type  I  error  was  preserved  at  ≤5%.  NI  for  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint was assessed first (at NI margin=1.38 and one-sided α= 0.025; and at NI margin=1.44 and 
one-sided α= 0.005). 
The following tests in the sequence were performed at the one-sided α= 0.025: 
•  If  NI  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  (using  a  NI  margin  of  1.38)  was  demonstrated,  then 
superiority for the primary efficacy endpoint was tested. 
•  If  superiority  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  demonstrated,  then  superiority  for  ISTH  major 
bleeding was tested. 
• If superiority for major bleeding was demonstrated, then superiority for all-cause death was tested. 
The study size was calculated to meet the NI margin of 1.44. With 448 subjects with confirmed strokes 
or SE, the study would have at least 90% power. Based on a sample size of 18,000 subjects allocated 
in a 1:1 ratio to the apixaban or warfarin group, assuming a primary efficacy endpoint rate of 1.20 per 
hundred subject-years, an average follow-up of ~2.1 years was estimated to be required to accrue the 
target  number  of  primary  efficacy  events.  These  calculations  assumed  an  incidence  of  1%  loss  to 
follow-up. 
Primary  efficacy  analysis:  An  intention-to-treat  analysis  was  performed  on  the  Randomized 
Population  based  on  adjudicated  primary  efficacy  endpoint  events  occurring  during  the  Intended 
Treatment  Period  (starts  on  day  of  randomisation  and  ends  at  the  efficacy  cut-off  date:  448  had  a 
primary efficacy endpoint.). 
Per-protocol  analyses  were  sensitivity  analyses  used  for  NI  assessments  and  included  events 
occurring  from  first  dose  through  x  days  after  last  dose  of  blinded  study  drug  for  the  Evaluable 
Population (x=2, 7, or 30 days in each of the sensitivity assessments). 
In the scientific advise (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/411449/2005) the non-inferiority margin of 1.44 based on 
the  relative  risk  of  apixaban  compared  to  warfarin  was  discussed  and  considered  appropriately 
justified.  
The rationale of the sample size calculations is plausible. The statistical methods used are acceptable. 
Superiority  of  apixaban  was  tested  following  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  testing  strategy,  after  NI  for 
apixaban (primary outcome) was shown. The sequence of the tests used in the study is acceptable. 
In general the design of ARISTOTLE study  was considered by the CHMP as adequate and in line with 
recently conducted studies with dabigatran and rivaroxaban supporting the same indication, i.e. RELY 
and ROCKET-AF studies, respectively. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  20,998  subjects  were  enrolled  in  study  CV185030.  Of  these  subjects,  18,201  were 
randomised to receive study treatment. Around 25% of the patients discontinued the study, which is in 
line  with  the  experience  in  similar  studies.  Main  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  subject  request  to 
discontinue  treatment  (around  10  %  in  each  treatment  group),  adverse  events  (7.4%  and  8.1%, 
respectively) and deaths (3.6% and 3.8%, respectively). Stroke and SE are both listed as reasons for 
discontinuation which can lead to misinterpretation of the results, as they are primary endpoints. The 
incidence  of  SE  (0.2%  and  <  0.1%,  respectively)  and  MI  (0.3%  and  0.2%,  respectively)  leading  to 
study discontinuation in the apixaban group are slightly higher than the VKA group, which is not in line 
with the efficacy results shown below. This discrepancy occurred as one calculation was based on the 
investigator's  assessment,  the  other  was  based  on  the  blinded  adjudication  by  an  independent

committee.  When  the  same  events  were  assessed  by  the  latter  committee,  the  results  of  both 
apixaban and warfarin were comparable. 
Recruitment 
The study  was conducted globally across 40 countries and 1053 sites and included subjects from EU, 
NA,  Asia/Pacific  and  Latin  America  (table  E2).  Subject’s  disposition  was  comparable  between  the 
treatment  groups.  About  40%  of  the  patients  were  classified  as  in  Europe.  It  is  noted  that  Russia 
(~10%), Israel (2%) and South Africa (0.5%) were also included under Europe. Actual representation 
from the EU region was 2032 and 2026 patients randomized to apixaban and VKA groups, respectively 
(~22%). This latter population allows a better comparison considering the expected difference in INR 
control per region.  
Table E2  Summary of Enrolment by Region - Randomized Subjects- CV185030 
“Europe” included: Russia, Israel and South Africa 
Baseline data 
The treatment groups were well balanced for the baseline disease characteristics, including risk factors, 
with no clinically relevant differences noted between the apixaban and warfarin groups (Table E3). The 
study  population  adequately  reflects  the  target  population  for  the  intended  indication.  The  mean  age 
was 69.1 years, with adequate representation of patients ≥ 75 years. Mean CHADS2 risk score was 2.1 
in  each  treatment  group;  the  majority  of  subjects  (66.9%)  in  both  treatment  groups  had  ≥2  risk 
factors at baseline. Treated hypertension was the most common risk factor (87.4%) followed by CHF 
(35.4%),  and  age  ≥75  years  (31.2%).  Overall,  19.4%  of  subjects  had  a  prior  stroke,  TIA,  or  SE. 
Although the studies included subjects with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke, a small 
percentage (n=12) of subjects in both treatment groups had a CHADS2 score of 0. The MAH explained 
that  the  CHADS2  score  criteria  are  more  restrictive  than  the  study  inclusion  criteria  based  on  risk 
factors,  which  explains  inclusion  patients  with  CHADS2  score=0.  These  patients  were  considered 
protocol deviations. Comparing participants in ARISTOTLE to those of recently published studies in the 
same  indication  shows  that  ARTISTOLE  and  RELY  (dabigatran)  recruited  patients  with  comparable 
CHADS2 scores (around 2).  In ROCKET-AF (rivaroxaban) the mean  CHADS2 score was  higher (3.47), 
making  further  comparisons  among  these  agents  difficult.  Co-administered  medications  reflect  the 
associated  co-morbidities  (anti-arrhythmics,  anti-hypertensions  and  anti-platelets).  ASA  was  co-
administered  in  around  30%  of  the  patients  allowing  adequate  conclusions  on  the  safety  of  this 
combination. Both VKA naïve and experienced patients are properly presented in the study (~42% and 
~57%, respectively).

Conduct of the study 
Importantly,  the  level  of  INR  control  is  highlighted,  with  several  analyses  submitted  showing  that 
generally  the  INR  was  controlled  within  the  therapeutic  range  (2-3)  for  a  median  of  60%;  and  66% 
after exclusion of the first 7 days and periods of VKA interruptions, in line with results of other recent 
studies (table E4).

This TTR allows a fair comparison versus apixaban. As expected VKA naïve patients had slightly lower 
levels of TTR (52.15%) vs 60.7% in the VKA experienced.

Outcomes and estimation 
The non-inferiority NI of apixaban versus warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated, 
followed  by  demonstration  of  superiority.  The  Kaplan-Meier  Plot  for  stroke/SE  during  the  Intended 
Treatment  Period  is  presented  in  Figure  E2.  The  NI  assessment  was  also  performed  based  on  PP 
analyses. Three separate sets of PP analyses were performed including events from first dose through 
2, 7, and 30 days after the last dose. The observed HR and p-values for NI and superiority tests were 
lower than those for intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses supporting the conclusion of superiority of apixaban 
relative to warfarin for the primary efficacy endpoint.

This  superiority  is  mainly  driven  by  the  lower  incidence  of  hemorrhagic  stroke  in  the  apixaban  group 
(0.42%)  compared  to  0.84%  in  the  VKA  group  and  to  a  lesser  extent  ischemic  stroke  (1.74%  vs 
1.91%  respectively),  with  comparable  effect  on  SE  (0.16%  vs  0.18%  respectively).  The  results  point 
that  apixaban  is  probably  a  safer  alternative  in  terms  of  bleeding  rather  than  a  more  effective  one 
(See: Summary of efficacy tables, Table E24 and E25).  
Apixaban  showed  a  reduction  in  all-cause  death,  a  secondary  endpoint  in  the  hierarchical  testing 
strategy, results are on the border of statistical significance [HR=0.89; 95%CI= 0.80; 1.00, two-sided 
p-value=0.0465].  Both  cardiovascular  deaths  [HR=0.89;  95%CI  =0.76-1.04]  and  non-cardiovascular 
deaths  [HR=0.93;  95%CI=0.77-1.13]  were  just  numerically  lower  in  the  apixaban  group,  without 
showing robust superiority in either subgroup.  
Of note, apixaban treatment was associated with a lower incidence of MI (0.53%/yr) compared to VKA 
(0.61%), HR =0.88 (95% CI:0.66-1.17). These results compare favourably with dabigatran which was 
associated  with  a  slightly  higher  incidence  of  MI  compared  to  VKA  (overall  rate  in  RELY:  0.82,  0.81, 
and 0.64 % / year for dabigatran 110 mg BID and 150 mg BID and VKA respectively). 
Since  warfarin  effectiveness  depends  heavily  on  the  degree  of  INR  control,  TTR  of  INR  therapeutic 
levels (2-3) was taken into account. Most of presented analyses show a favourable effect of apixaban 
over VKA using different  methods of calculating TTR, however superiority was not consistently shown 
except  with  study  sites  with  INR  below  the  median  quartile  of  INR  control  (TTR  individual 
65.99%)(HR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-0.98) but lost in sites with INR ≥ median  INR (HR=0.81; 95% CI: 
0.61-1.08).  Using  TTR,  presented  by  centres 4   TTRc,  apixaban  shows  favourable  results,  with  HR 
consistently below 1 (0.77-0.81) but no superiority compared to VKA; 95% CI varying from 0.57-1.07 
to  0.52-1.26  (table  E6).  Conclusions  are  also  applicable  to  all  cause  death,  but  importantly,  in  the 
highest TTRc quartile (> 72.2%), HR was 1.04 (95%CI: 0.82-1.33). Thus, although the overall results 
support the superiority of apixaban over VKA, this superiority was not shown in patients well controlled 
on VKA.

Table E6: Comparison of Apixaban and VKA Efficacy Outcome Events (Stroke/SE, All Cause 
Mortality) by TTRc Quartile 
Efficacy  results  presented  in  different  subgroups  were  generally  consistent  with  the  primary  efficacy 
results for the study (Figure E3). Importantly, for the subgroup of patients receiving the reduced dose 
of  apixaban  (2.5  mg  BID),  event  rates  favoured  apixaban  over  warfarin  (1.43%/yr  vs  7.23%/yr, 
HR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.91), suggesting effective exposure in this reduced dose group (Figure E3). 
In  patients  <  65  years,  incidence  of  stroke/SE  was  slightly  higher  in  the  apixaban  group  than  VKA 
group resulting in a HR=1.16 (95% CI: 0.77- 1.73), although results of patients above 75 years were 
in line with the general favourable results. The MAH explored three parameters which could have led to 
worse  results  in  patients  <65  years,  mainly:  patient's  characteristics,  VKA  control  and  apixaban 
exposure in the ARISTOTLE study. Submitted analyses show that none of these parameters could have 
significantly  affected  the  results.  This  is  further  supported  by  data  from  the  AVERROES  study 
presented below. It can be concluded that the trend for worse efficacy results in patients <65 years is 
probably a chance finding.

Reduced efficacy is shown in patients randomized in the EU: HR for stroke/SE= 0.92; (95% CI = 0.56; 
1.52),  HR  for  all  cause  death=  0.89  (95%  CI  =  0.68;  1.18).  This  could  probably  be  attributed  to  a 
better INR control (median 68.93%). Patients with severe renal impairment were poorly represented in 
ARISTOTLE  (n=270,  apixaban  group  =  137).  Generally  lower  events  rates  were  reported  in  the 
apixaban group compared to the warfarin group; with more favourable results in patients administered 
the  lower  dose  (n=89)  (1.43%/yr  vs  7.23%/yr,  HR=0.19,  95%  CI:  0.04-0.91),  than  patients 
administered  the  full  dose  (n=48)  (HR  and  upper  bound  of  the  associated 95%  CI  were  ≥1;  95%  CI 
was wide (0.43-34.72). Further analysis of the data showed that patients with exclusive severe renal 
impairment  have  a  more  favourable  benefit  risk  profile  when  administered  the  reduced  dose  (see: 
Clinical Safety section of the CHMP AR).  
During the period from the end of Intended Treatment Period up to 30 days after the last dose of study 
medication, a total of 27 stroke/SE events in the apixaban group versus only 10 events occurred in the 
warfarin  group.  A  similar  observation  was  seen  in  the  ROCKET-AF  (31  cases  of  stroke/SE  in  the 
rivaroxaban group compared to 12 cases warfarin group between day 2 and day 7 after discontinuation 
of randomized treatment). According to the MAH, this excess number of events in the apixaban group 
is  unlikely  to  represent  a  lack  of  efficacy  nor  is  it  a  “rebound”  phenomenon  as  most  of  the  events 
occurred more than 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug. The MAH believed that the “rebound” 
phenomenon  is  more  observed  in  inhibitors  of  thrombin.  Direct  FXa  inhibitor,  such  as  apixaban  or 
rivaroxaban or an indirect FXa inhibitor, such as fondaparinux, are not expected to impact thrombin or 
activated  protein  C  levels.  Cessation  of  rivaroxaban  following orthopedic  surgery  was  not  followed  by 
rebound 5.  It  can  be  agreed  that  since  subjects  were  still  on  apixaban  treatment  in  only  four  cases 
versus  three  cases  still  on  warfarin  therapy,  a  direct  relation  with  apixaban  was  not  shown.  Of  note, 
the PP sensitivity analysis still showed superiority of apixaban over warfarin in an analysis inclusive of 
events  till  30  days  from  last  study  drug  intake.  Further  analyses  shows  that  the  highest  risk  of 
stroke/SE  is  seen  in  patients  not  used  to  VKA  (either  VKA  naïve,  or  on  apixaban)  switching  to  VKA. 
Most  of  the  events  in  these  switchers  occurred  2  weeks  after  the  switch.  These  findings  support  that 
this higher incidence events is probably due to the difficulties associated with establishing an adequate 
INR  in  VKA  naïve  patients.  The  late  onset  of  events  precludes  a  rebound  hypercoagulability  problem. 
These conclusions can also explain the slight imbalance of mortality (apixaban=53; VKA=48) following 
discontinuation of these anticoagulants.  
To  minimise  the  risk  of  stroke/SE  when  switching  from  apixaban  to  VKA,  the  MAH  proposed  some 
SmPC changes in section 4.2. These recommendations were generally acceptable by the CHMP. 
Study CV185048 (AVERROES) 
To  support  the  indication  of  administration  of  apixaban  in  patients  unsuitable  for  VKA,  the  MAH 
submitted the AVERROES study.

Methods 
Recruitment to AVERROES study was limited to subjects with AF and at least one additional risk factor 
for stroke, who were not  receiving VKA therapy at  study entry and included both those subjects who 
had previously used but discontinued VKA (Demonstrated VKA Unsuitable) and those subjects who had 
not previously used VKA but were considered unsuitable candidates by the investigator (Expected VKA 
Unsuitable).  This  study  was  initiated  after  ARISTOTLE,  but  was  terminated  earlier  due  to  the  shown 
efficacy  (an  interim  analysis  showed  clinically  relevant  efficacy  of  apixaban  over  ASA).  Subjects  who 
discontinued VKA therapy (demonstrated unsuitable) were patients in whom laboratory monitoring was 
unsuccessful (e.g., unable to obtain or maintain  INR measurements at requested intervals, unable or 
refused to adhere to dose or INR monitoring instructions); patients who experienced adverse events; 
and patients who refused further treatment with VKA. Expected VKA unsuitable group included patients 
who  were  considered  unlikely  to  comply  with  dosing  or  monitoring  requirements;  patients  considered 
unlikely to adhere to restrictions on alcohol, diet or non-prescription medications, or were unwilling to 
take  VKA  and  patients  in  whom  the  risk  of  VKA  therapy  was  considered  to  outweigh  the  potential 
benefits for preventing stroke or SE.  
The  chosen  criteria  to  indicate  patient's  unsuitability  to  VKA  is  quite  subjective.  It  depends  on  the 
perception  of  both  the  investigator  and  the  patient,  and  also  based  on  medical  as  well  as  social 
preferences. It can be agreed that in real life such decisions are also not entirely objective. However, in 
a  clinical  study  and  in  order  to  allow  proper  extrapolation  of  the  results,  more  objective  measures 
should have been chosen for recruitment, in particular previous discontinuation of VKA due to bleeding. 
As shown below, this subgroup is very limitedly represented. 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were subjects ≥50 years of age, with documented permanent, paroxysmal 
or  persistent  AF,  presenting  with  at  least  one  risk  factor  for  stroke,  and  not  currently  receiving  VKA 
therapy. Main study exclusion criteria included: AF due to reversible causes, valvular disease requiring 
surgery  and  planned  AF  ablation  procedure  to  be  performed  within  3  months.  The  study  population 
adequately reflected the target population for the intended indication. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  either  apixaban  or  ASA.  Apixaban  posology  followed  the 
same  algorithm  used  in  ARISTOTLE  Study.  The  ASA  dose  (81,  162,  243,  or  324  mg  QD)  was  at  the 
discretion  of  the  investigator.  The  ASA  dose  initially  assigned  to  the  subject  was  to  be  maintained 
throughout  the  study  unless  a  change  in  dose  within  the  range  was  clinically  indicated.  Additional 
open-label ASA was permitted for subjects who had a clear clinical indication for anti-platelet therapy, 
but was not to exceed 100 mg QD. 
The  study  consisted  of  a  Screening  period  of  0  to  28  days;  followed  by  the  Double-blind  Treatment 
Period  lasting  until  the  earlier  of  a  subject’s  discontinuation  of  double-blind  study  drug  or  the 
attainment  of  approximately  226  primary  efficacy  events.  The  30-day  Follow-up  Period  started  after 
the  last  dose  of  double-blind  study  drug  for  subjects  who  did  not  enter  the  Optional  Open-label 
Treatment  Period  (LTOLE).  Subjects  who  discontinued  study  treatment  were  followed  for  outcome 
events until the double-blind phase of the study end date. 
The  choice  of  ASA  as  the  active  comparator  deserves  some  discussion  as  it  impacts  on  the 
interpretation of the results. According to the ESC clinical practice guideline for the management of AF 
(2010), the combination of ASA and clopidogrel could be used in patients intolerant to VKA, for reasons 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 36/84 
 
 
 
 
other than an increased risk of bleeding. This could apply in particular to patients with a relatively high 
risk  of  thrombosis.  However,  this  combination  was  not  approved  at the  time AVERROES  was  started.  
The efficacy of ASA in the updated focused ESC guideline (2012) is considered weak, with a potential 
for harm, since the risk of major bleeding (and ICH) with aspirin is not significantly different to that of 
OAC, especially in the elderly. However, based on the available guidance at the time of conducting the 
trials, ASA appeared to be the only available choice for patients intolerant to VKA due to an increased 
risk of bleeding. The suitability of using ASA as the active comparator could only be determined by the 
actual representation of each of the different sub-groups, in particular patients who discontinued VKA 
due to bleeding. This subgroup is also important as it is expected to be the main group to support the 
claim that patients who had a higher bleeding risk with VKA are being better managed with apixaban. 
Most of the patients in the ASA group were administered doses of 81 or 162 mg, which is a bit higher 
than  currently  advised  by  the  ESC  clinical  practice  guideline  (75-100  mg),  but  no  strict 
recommendations are given.  
Objectives 
Primary  objective  was  to  determine  if  apixaban  is  superior  to  ASA  for  preventing  the  composite 
outcome of stroke or SE in subjects with AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke who have 
failed  or  are  unsuitable  for  VKA  therapy.  Secondary  objectives  were  to  determine,  in  the  same 
subjects, if apixaban is superior to ASA for prevention of the composite outcome of stroke, SE, MI, or 
vascular death (major vascular events). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time from randomisation to first occurrence of un-refuted stroke 
(any type including ischemic, hemorrhagic or of uncertain type) or SE during the Intended Treatment 
Period. 
Statistical methods and sample size 
The testing strategy was as follows: 
• Superiority of apixaban relative to ASA for stroke/SE (primary efficacy endpoint) was tested first. 
• If superiority for stroke/SE was demonstrated, then superiority was tested for major vascular events 
(stroke/SE/MI/vascular death) at the one-sided α= 0.00003. (The small significance level resulted from 
meeting the early stopping criterion for the primary endpoint). 
• If superiority for major vascular events was demonstrated, then superiority was tested for all-cause 
death at the one-sided α= 0.00003. 
Sample  size: Assuming an average 1.6 years follow-up and a stroke rate of 3.3 per hundred subject 
years in ASA-treated subjects, the study would have at least 90% power to detect a 35% relative risk 
reduction  (RRR)  of  apixaban  versus  ASA  at  the  one-sided  α  =  0.025  if  there  were  226  subjects  with 
un-refuted  strokes  or  systemic  emboli.  It  was  calculated  that  5600  subjects  need  to  be  randomised 
and  allocated  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  the  apixaban  or  ASA  group  to  achieve  the  desired  power.  These 
calculations  assumed  an  incidence  of  1%  loss  to  follow  up.  Event  rates  and  between  group 
assumptions for this study were based on intent-to-treat analyses of previous outcome studies. 
The study included 2 planned interim analyses for efficacy: 
1.  The  first  analysis  was  targeted  to  occur  when  approximately  50%  of  the  total  226  subjects  with 
primary  events  un-refuted  by  adjudication  had  accrued.  In  this  interim  look,  the  primary  endpoint 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report

would be monitored using a modified Haybittle- Peto boundary of 4 standard deviations (two-sided p-
value  <0.00006).  The  boundary  refers  to  a  treatment  difference  that  is  greater  than  the  prescribed 
number of standard errors and that favours apixaban. 
2. The second analysis was targeted to occur when approximately 75% of the total 226 subjects with 
primary  events  un-refuted  by  adjudication  had  accrued.  In  this  interim  look,  the  primary  endpoint 
would  be  monitored  using  a  modified  Haybittle-  Peto  of  3  standard  deviations  (two-sided  p-value 
<0.0026). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 6,421 subjects were enrolled in study CV185048; of these subjects, 5,598 were randomised 
to  receive  study  treatment.  Discontinuation  rates  were  558  (19.9%)  subjects  in  the  apixaban 
treatment  group,  versus  649  (23.3%)  patients  in  the  ASA  treatment  group.  Importantly, 
discontinuations  due  to  bleeding  are  more  frequently  reported  in  the  apixaban  group  (n=35,  1.2%) 
compared to ASA (n=20, 0.7%). 
Recruitment 
The trial was conducted across 36 countries and 526 sites (Table E15). The countries with the greater 
proportion  of  randomized  subjects  (≥5%  of  the  total)  were  Russia  (12.5%),  USA  (9.5%),  Brazil 
(7.4%), Mexico (6.2%), and Germany (5.8%).  
Table E15 Summary of Enrolment by Region and Country - Randomized Subjects 
Europe included Turkey, Russia, South Africa and Israel. 
The treatment groups were balanced at End of Treatment subject disposition with no clinically relevant 
differences in these data, except for events related to the primary efficacy endpoint (Table E16).

Table E16 End of Treatment Period Subject Status Summary – Randomised Subjects 
(CV185048) 
Approximately one-third of the subjects in CV185048 (31.6% in the apixaban group and 33.4% in the 
ASA  group)  did  not  enter  the  optional  Open-label  Extension  (LTOLE)  and  completed  the  planned  30-
day Follow-up Period. At the time of database lock for the double-blind phase of the study, 40.4% of 
subjects in the apixaban group and 38.2% in the ASA group had entered the LTOLE (i.e., had received 
at least one dose of open-label apixaban). 
Baseline data 
Treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  for  baseline  demographic  characteristics  and  physical 
measurements  with  no  clinically  relevant  differences  noted  in  these  characteristics  for  randomised 
subjects (Table E17). The mean age of randomised subjects was 69.9 years; 33.8% of subjects were 
≥75  years  of  age  and  35.5%  of  subjects  were  ≥65  but  <75  years  of  age.  Most  subjects  were  white 
(78.6%) and male (58.5%). Approximately 84% were >60 kg in weight and approximately 47% had a 
BMI of >28 kg/m2. 
Table E17 Baseline Characteristics of Randomised Subject (CV185048) 
The mean CHADS2 score was 2.0 in each treatment group. Overall, 38.3% of randomised subjects had 
a CHADS2 score of 1, 35.2% had a score of 2 and 26.5% had a score ≥3. The most common risk 
factors were hypertension with pharmacological treatment (86.4%).

Conduct of the study 
Study  CV185048  was  stopped  early  because  a  planned  interim  analysis  by  an  independent  DMC 
demonstrated  evidence  of  a  clinically  important  reduction  in  stroke  and  SE  in  subjects  in  this  AF 
population  who  had  received  apixaban  in  comparison  with  ASA;  in  addition  to  reduction  of  major 
vascular  events  and  all  cause  deaths.  These  impressive  results  should  be  treated  with  caution 
considering the above concerns about the choice of ASA as a comparator in the first place.  
Numbers analysed 
Table E21 Analysis Population Summary 
Outcomes and estimation 
Due to the premature termination of the study, the original target number of efficacy events was not 
achieved prior to ending the Double-blind Treatment Period of Study CV185048. 
Primary  Efficacy  Endpoint.  Apixaban  was  superior  to  ASA  [HR=0.45;  (95%CI;  0.32;  0.62);  two-
sided p-value <0.00001] for the prevention of stroke/SE (see table E22). The majority of the primary 
outcome events were ischemic or unspecified strokes with 43 (1.53%) events in the apixaban group, 
versus  95  (3.4%)  events  in  the  ASA  group    [HR  =  0.44  (95%  CI  =0.31,  0.63)].  Apixaban  [n=2 
(0.07%)] was also associated with lower numbers in SE relative to ASA [n=11 (0.39%)]. 
Overall,  2237  of  5598  (40%)  randomized  subjects  had  previously  used  VKA  (demonstrated  VKA 
unsuitable) and 60% were expected VKA unsuitable. Among prior VKA users, 48.4% had difficulty with 
INR  control  and  23.9%  experienced  bleeding  on  VKA  (4.3%  major  bleeds)  (Table  E22).  The  actual 
representation  of  patients  who  had  discontinued  VKA  due  to  bleeding  was  very  small  (11.9%);  the 
most  common  reasons  provided  for  discontinuations  were  physician’s  decision  (20.4%),  patient’s 
decision (19.7%), and difficulty to control INR (19.1%).

Table E22 Summary of Prior VKA Experience - Randomized Subjects Who Previously Used 
VKA 
Based  on  the  investigator’s  judgement,  more  than  half  of  the  randomised  patients  were  considered 
unsuitable  for  VKA  due  to  reasons  related  to  bleeding  (Table  E23).  Still  this  population  is  not 
considered  to  reflect  VKA  unsuitable  patients  compared  to  patients  who  actually  had  bleeding  or 
discontinued VKA due to bleeding. Also, the majority of patients who had a history of bleeding on VKA, 
reported  mainly  minor  bleeds  on  VKA  with  only  few  major  bleedings.  This  specifically  questions  the 
ability of AVERROES to address VKA unsuitable patients, and whether apixaban offers to these patients 
a safer and equally effective alternative to VKA. The question of the comparability of apixaban to VKA 
in general is addressed in ARISTOTLE.

Randomized Subjects 
Overall results within each subgroup were consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint. Importantly, 
results  of  patients  with  demonstrated  VKA  intolerance  (apixaban:  1.73%  vs.  ASA:  4.2%;  HR=0.33; 
95%  CI:  0.19-0.56)  were  comparable  to  those  expected  to  be  intolerant  (apixaban:  1.79%  vs.  ASA: 
3.25%;  HR=0.55;  95%  CI:  0.36-0.84)  (Figure  E4).  The  subgroup  of  patients  with  CHADS2  =1  and 
physician did not recommend VKA was the only subgroup with conflicting results (HR= 2.18; 95% CI; 
0.040- 11.91).

Supportive study 
Study CV185067 was presented in clinical safety section. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In  the  ARISTOTLE  study  a  total  of  18,201  patients  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment  with 
apixaban 5 mg twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients [4.7%]) or warfarin (target INR 
range  2.0-3.0),  patients  were  exposed  to  study  drug  for  a  mean  of  20  months.    The  mean  age  was 
69.1  years,  the  mean  CHADS2  score  was  2.1  and  18.9 %  of  patients  had  prior  stroke  or  TIA.  In  the 
study,  apixaban  achieved  statistically  significant  superiority  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  prevention  of 
stroke  (haemorrhagic  or  ischaemic)  and  systemic  embolism  compared  with  warfarin.  For  patients 
randomized to warfarin, the median percentage of time in therapeutic range (TTR) (INR 2-3) was 66%. 
Apixaban  showed  a  reduction  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  compared  to  warfarin  across  the 
different levels of center TTR; within the highest quartile of TTR according to center, the hazard ratio 
for  apixaban  vs  warfarin  was  0.73  (95%  CI,  0.38,  1.40).  Key  secondary  endpoints  of  major  bleeding 
and  all  cause  death  were  tested  in  a  pre-specified  hierarchical  testing  strategy  to  control  the  overall 
type  1  error  in  the  trial.  Statistically  significant  superiority  was  also  achieved  in  the  key  secondary 
endpoints of both major bleeding and all-cause death. With improving monitoring of INR the observed 
benefits  of  apixaban  compared  to  warfarin  regarding  all  cause  death  diminished.  The  efficacy  results 
for prespecified subgroups, including CHADS2 score, age, body weight, gender, status of renal function, 
prior  stroke  or  TIA  and  diabetes  were  consistent  with  the  primary  efficacy  results  for  the  overall 
population studied in the trial.  
In  the  AVERROES  study  a  total  of  5,598  patients  considered  to  be  unsuitable  for  VKA  by  the 
investigators  were  randomized  to  treatment  with  apixaban  5 mg  twice  daily (or  2.5 mg  twice daily  in 
selected patients [6.4%]) or ASA. ASA was given at a once daily dose of 81 mg (64%), 162 (26.9%), 
243  (2.1%),  or  324  mg  (6.6%)  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator.  Patients  were  exposed  to  study 
drug for a mean of 14 months. The mean age was  69.9 years, the mean CHADS2 score was 2.0 and 
13.6%  of  patients  had  prior  stroke  or  TIA.  Common  reasons  for  unsuitability  for  VKA  therapy  in  the 
AVERROES  study  included  unable/unlikely  to  obtain  INRs  at  requested  intervals  (42.6%),  patient 
refused  treatment  with  VKA  (37.4%),  CHADS2  score = 1  and  physician  did  not  recommend  VKA 
(21.3%),  patient  could  not  be  relied  on  to  adhere  to  VKA  medication  instruction  (15.0%),  and 
difficulty/expected  difficulty  in  contacting  patient  in  case  of  urgent  dose  change  (11.7%).  AVERROES 
was stopped early based on a recommendation by the independent Data Monitoring Committee due to

clear evidence of reduction of stroke and systemic embolism with an acceptable safety profile. In this 
study,  apixaban  achieved  statistically  significant  superiority  in  the  primary  endpoint  of  prevention  of 
stroke (haemorrhagic, ischaemic or unspecified) or systemic embolism compared to ASA.  
Both  phase  3  studies  CV185030  and  CV185048  show  that  apixaban  5  mg  (2.5  mg  for  restricted 
patients)  is  associated  with  significantly  lower  incidence  of  stroke  and  SE  than  VKA  or  ASA, 
respectively.  Also  the  secondary  endpoint  of  all  cause  death  is  significantly  less  frequent  in  the 
apixaban arm compared to VKA arm. Benefits were weaker in subgroups with better INR control, but 
this  was  still  an  acceptable  result  considering that  apixaban  offers  other  advantages  over  VKA,  like  a 
more  favourable  interaction  profile  and  no  need  for  routine  monitoring.  The  use  of  apixaban  as  an 
alternative to patients unsuitable to VKA was not supported by the CHMP, as the criteria defining this 
unsuitability  were  too  subjective.  Actual  representation  of  patients  who  discontinued  VKA  due  to 
bleeding  was  very  limited.  Superiority  of  apixaban  over  ASA  was  acknowledged  with  the  caveat  that 
ASA  may  not  have  been  the  most  suitable  active  comparator  for  the  whole  cohort  as  clopidogrel  is 
sometimes  added  according  to  the  ESC  Clinical  practice  guideline  for  the  management  of  atrial 
fibrillation 2010. The main study results were included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, apixaban has shown to be a beneficial anti-thrombotic for the prevention of stroke/SE in 
AF patients, with no extra burden in the bleeding risk compared to VKA.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This  section  presents  safety  information  from  the  two  completed  Phase  3  studies  (CV185030  and 
CV185048).  Relevant  data  will  be  presented  pooled  or  separately  for  each  of  the  studies.  Safety 
information  is  also  presented  for  218  treated  subjects  with  AF  from  a  completed  Phase  2  study 
(CV185067) conducted in Japan. Reference will also be made in certain sections to the available safety 
data from apixaban investigated in other indications. 
Patient exposure 
The total number of subjects who received at least 1 dose of any double-blind study drug in the Phase 
2/3  AF  studies  was  23,936,  of  which  23,718  were  in  the  phase  3  studies.  Of  these,  11,886  subjects 
received  apixaban  5  mg  BID  (or  2.5  mg  BID  for  subjects  meeting  criteria  for  dose  reduction  at 
randomization  in  the  Phase  3  studies),  9052  subjects  received  warfarin,  and  2780  subjects  received 
ASA (Figure S1).

Adverse events  
The overall AE profile of apixaban in the Phase 3 studies was similar to that of warfarin in CV185030, 
and was similar to that of ASA in CV185048 (Table S1).  
Table S1 Summary of Safety During the Treatment Period – Treated Subjects, Study 
CV185030 and Study CV185048 
In  Study  CV185030  the  frequency  of  AEs  was  similar  in  the  apixaban  and  warfarin  groups  for 
warfarin/VKA-naive and warfarin/VKA-experienced subjects. Drug-related AEs were reported for 27.8% 
of  subjects  in  the  apixaban  group  and  34.2%  in  the  warfarin  group.  The  most  common  drug-related 
AEs  were  related  to  bleeding.  For  the  reported  events,  the  frequency  of  bleeding  with  apixaban  was 
generally  less  than  that  reported  with  VKA:  epistaxis  (apixaban  5.0%;  warfarin  6.1%),  haematuria 
(apixaban  2.6%;  warfarin  3.2%),  contusion  (apixaban  1.7%;  warfarin  3.2%),  hematoma  (apixaban 
1.4%; warfarin 3.5%), gingival bleeding (apixaban 1.0%; warfarin 2.1%), and ecchymosis (apixaban 
0.9%;  warfarin  2.0%).  In  CV185048,  the  frequency  of  drug-related  AEs  was  similar  in  the  two 
treatment groups (apixaban 16.6%, ASA 16.7%). No drug-related AEs (preferred terms) were reported 
in  ≥2%  of  subjects  in  either  group.  During  the  Follow-up  Period,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful 
differences  between  the  apixaban  and  comparator  groups  for  the  frequency  for  AEs  in  either  study 
(3.3% in the apixaban group and 3.4% in the warfarin group in CV185030; apixaban 7.2%, ASA 7.8% 
in CV185048).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  study  CV185030,  the  incidence  of  death  was  shown  to  be  lower  in  the  apixaban  group  (4.7%) 
compared to VKA (5.2%) during the treatment period. Also, in study CV185048, serious AEs SAEs with 
outcome  of  death  were  reported  slightly  more  frequently  in  the  ASA  group  (4.1%)  compared  to 
apixaban (3.3%).  
For  SAEs,  overall  frequency  was  similar  in  the  apixaban  group  compared  with  the  warfarin  group  in 
CV185030.  In  CV185048,  the  overall  frequency  of  SAEs  with  onset  during  the  treatment  period  was 
23.5%  in  the  apixaban  group  vs.  28.9%  in  the  ASA  group  (table  S1).  The  most  common  SAEs  were 
Cardiac Disorders in both studies. No new safety signals were detected in these studies.

1.  Bleeding.  Adjudicated  major  bleeding  (adapted  from  ISTH  guidelines)  was  the  primary  safety 
endpoint  in  both  Phase  3  studies.  According  to  the  pre-specified  sequential  testing  strategy  in  study 
CV185030,  the  superiority  of  apixaban  compared  to  warfarin  demonstrated  for  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint signalled the sequential testing of ISTH major bleeding. Apixaban was superior to warfarin for 
ISTH major bleeding, major or CRNM bleeding (clinically relevant non-major) and all bleeding (table S2 
and figure S2).

Bleeding  classified  by  INR.  Consistent  with  the  primary  safety  results,  apixaban  demonstrated  a 
reduction  in  ISTH  major  bleeding  compared  to  warfarin  for  study  sites  with  INR  control  below  and 
above  the  median  TTR  as  well  as  in  each  of  the  4  quartile  intervals  (table  S3).  Similar  results  were 
observed  when  these  analyses  were  performed  by  using  the  TTR  value  when  warfarin  interruptions 
were included in the calculation.

The  frequency  of  the  individual  components  of  major  bleeding  were  generally  lower  or  similar  in  the 
apixaban group compared with the warfarin group except for intraocular bleeding (Table S4).

Table  S6  Summary  of  Components  of  ISTH  Major  Bleeding  During  Treatment  Period  – 
Treated Subjects (CV185048) 
Six of 2798 subjects (0.21%, 0.19%/year) in the apixaban group (0 in the ASA group) had ISTH major 
bleeding  for  which  the  investigator-assigned  location  was  intraocular.  Further  analysis  revealed  an 
extra  case  of  vitreous  haemorrhage,  originally  classified  “Other”.  Of  these  7  ISTH  major  bleeding 
events, 3 were vitreous haemorrhage (resolving in 10, 12, and 19 days, respectively); 2 events of eye 
haemorrhage  (ocular  haemorrhage  resolving  in  21  days,  and  intraocular  bleeding,  resolving  in  129 
days) and one event of loss of vision (occurred approximately 3 months after eye surgery of a macular 
hole). Two of the 7 apixaban-treated subjects with intraocular ISTH major bleeding had diabetes. The 
frequency  of  diabetes  in  the  overall  population  was  19.1%  in  the  apixaban  group  and  20.0%  in  the 
ASA group. 
2. Liver-related safety results.  The frequency of elevations of LFTs with onset during the Treatment 
Period was low and similar in the apixaban and comparator groups (table S7).

Table  S7  Summary  of  LFT  Elevations  during  the  Treatment  Period  -  Treated  Subjects  with 
Available Measurements (Pooled CV185030 and CV185048) 
Liver-related SAEs occurred with low and similar frequency in the apixaban and comparator groups (59 
[0.5% and 55 [0.5%] subjects, respectively).  Liver-related SAEs with outcome of death were reported 
for a total of 13 subjects (7 subjects in the apixaban group and 6 subjects in the comparator group). 
Of 13 deaths, 4 (2 in each treatment group) occurred during the Follow-up Period. Most subjects with 
SAEs  related  to  elevations  in  LFT  with  outcome  of  death  had  underlying  disease  conditions,  such  as 
hepatic  malignancy.  Liver-related  AEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  occurred  in  35  (0.3%) 
subjects in the apixaban group and 42 (0.4%) in the comparator group. All liver-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation  were  reported  for  ≤0.1%  of  subjects  in  either  treatment  group.  Comparable  results 
were also reported during the follow-period.  
Three independent hepatologists provided blinded assessments of subjects with concurrent elevations 
of ALT >3x ULN and total bilirubin >2 x ULN and/or pre-selected SAEs (jaundice, hepatitis, and hepatic 
failure) related to elevated LFTs across the entire Phase 2/3 clinical program for apixaban (N=57,706 
treated subjects). The number of cases assessed as possible or probable relationship to the study drug 
by  the  independent,  blinded,  hepatologists’  panel  was  low  and  balanced  between  the  2  groups.    Six 
apixaban-treated  subjects  had  on-study  concurrent  LFT  elevations  of  ALT>3xULN  and  TBili>2xULN 
assessed by as possibly or probably related to study drug. All 6 apixaban-treated subjects had AEs or 
SAEs of hepatitis, and 2 of these 6 subjects had SAEs of hepatitis with outcome of death assessed as 
possibly  related  to  study  drug.  Another  of  these  6  subjects  had  a  nonfatal  SAE  of  acute  hepatitis 
assessed as probably related to study drug.

For  the  non-AF  studies  (22,386  subjects  apixaban  or  reference  treatments  (placebo,  enoxaparin,  or 
warfarin)  in  eight  completed  studies  in  non-AF  indications),  a  total  of  11  cases  were  assessed  as 
possibly  related  to  study  drug  (apixaban  7,  comparator  5).  Of  the  7  cases  in  apixaban-treated 
subjects, one subject had a liver-related SAE with fatal outcome.  
Laboratory findings 
The  incidence  of  laboratory  values  that  met  the  criteria  for  marked  abnormalities  was  similar  in  both 
treatment  groups.  Few  subjects  had  platelet  counts  decreased  from  baseline  to  <50,000/mm3  (4 
[<0.1%] subjects in each treatment group. A total of 111 (1.3%) subjects in the apixaban group and 
101  (1.2%)  subjects  in  the  warfarin  group  had  platelet  counts  decreased  from  baseline  to 
<100,000/mm3  during  the  Treatment  Period.  Five  (<0.1%)  subjects  in  the  apixaban  group  and  7 
(<0.1%) subjects in the warfarin group had an SAE of thrombocytopenia during the Treatment Period. 
Safety in special populations 
Bleeding.  In  study  CV185030,  the  results  within  each  subgroup  were  consistent  with  the  results  for 
the study for ISTH major, composite of ISTH major or CRNM and all bleeding (data shown in figure S4 
are only for ISTH major bleeding).

Figure S4 Analyses for ISTH major Bleeding – Treated Subjects (CV185030) 
Results  of  a  post  hoc  analysis  of  major  bleeding  in  the  small  subset  of  subjects  with  severe  renal 
impairment (136 and 132 subjects in the apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively) were consistent 
(event  rate  of  3.8%/year  vs.  11.9%/year,  respectively).  Another  post-hoc  sub-group  analysis  was 
performed  in  subjects  from  countries  of  the  EU  (apixaban  2,032,  warfarin  2,026).  Event  rates  for 
major  bleeding  were  slightly  higher  in  the  apixaban  and  warfarin  groups  (2.29%/yr  and  2.56%yr, 
respectively; HR 0.90 [95% CI: 0.66, 1.22]) than  were major bleeding event rates in the larger pre-
specified  EU  subgroup  depicted  in  figure  S4  (1.74%/yr  and  2.21%/yr  for  apixaban  and  warfarin, 
respectively;  HR  0.80  [95%  CI:  0.62,  1.02]).  Hazard  ratios  were  favourable  for  apixaban  in  each  of 
these subgroup analyses, albeit of lesser magnitude in the smaller EU member state analysis.  
Study  CV185048.  Overall,  the  results  within  each  subgroup  were  consistent  with  the  results  for  the 
study for ISTH major, composite of ISTH major or CRNM and all bleeding identified by the investigator, 
as shown in figure S5.

Figure S5 Subgroup Analyses for Major Bleeding – Treated Subjects (CV185048) 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Bleeding  Risk  with  Concomitant  Use  of  ASA  or  ASA+Thienopyridine.  The  number  of  subjects 
receiving ASA+study drug was 3529/9088 in the apixaban group and 3431/9052 in the warfarin group 
The addition of ASA to study drug increased the risk of ISTH major bleeding in each treatment group 
(apixaban  3.42%/year  vs.1.78%/year  for  subjects  receiving  vs.  not  receiving  ASA;  warfarin 
4.59%/year vs. 2.70%/year for subjects receiving vs. not receiving ASA). The bleeding risk associated 
with  concomitant  use  of  ASA+study  drug  was  lower  for  apixaban  compared  with  warfarin  for  ISTH 
major  bleeding  and  all  other  bleeding  endpoints,  including  intracranial  bleeding.  Fatal  haemorrhages 
were observed for 3 subjects on apixaban and 9 subjects on warfarin while receiving ASA+study drug. 
The  number  of  subjects  receiving  ASA+thienopyridine+study  drug  was  211/9088  (2.3%)  in  the 
apixaban  group  and  170/9052  (1.9%)  in  the  warfarin  group.  The  addition  of  ASA+thienopyridine  to 
study  drug  increased  the  risk  of  bleeding  in  each  treatment  group  (apixaban  7.53%/year  vs. 
2.11%/year  for  subjects  receiving  vs.  not  receiving  ASA+thienopyridine;  warfarin  20.80%/year  vs. 
3.04%/year for subjects receiving vs. not receiving ASA+thienopyridine). The bleeding risk associated 
with concomitant use of ASA+thienopyridine+study  drug was lower for apixaban than warfarin  for all

bleeding endpoints and intracranial bleeds (observed rate difference < 0). Given the infrequent use of 
the triple combination in the study, the number of events observed for subjects while on triple therapy 
was small, and all 95% CI for rate difference included 0. There were no fatal haemorrhages observed 
for subjects in either treatment group while on triple therapy. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No marked differences between the treatment groups were observed in the frequencies of AEs leading 
to discontinuation in either of the Phase 3 studies. In CV185030, the frequency of AEs leading to study 
treatment  discontinuation  was  similar  in  the  apixaban  and  warfarin  groups  in  the  overall  population 
(apixaban 7.6%, warfarin  8.4%) and in warfarin/VKA-naïve subjects (apixaban 7.8%, warfarin 8.8%) 
and warfarin/VKA-experienced subjects (apixaban 7.4%. warfarin 8.1%). 
In CV185048, the frequency of AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation was 9.5% vs. 13.0% in 
the apixaban vs. ASA groups, respectively. Most AEs leading to discontinuation were reported for <1% 
of subjects in either treatment group.

Safety  in  the  Ongoing,  Long-term,  Open-label  Extension  of  CV185048.  This  phase  is  till 
ongoing,  data  presented  has  a  cut-off  date  of  01-Apr-2011.  A  total  of  2570  subjects  received  open-
label apixaban in the LTOLE. The mean extent of exposure was 25.8 weeks (range 0.1 to 62.6 weeks). 
Approximately  60%  of  subjects  had  completed  at  least  26  weeks  of  open-label  apixaban  at  the  data 
cutoff  date.  The  frequencies  of  deaths  (24  [0.9%]  subjects),  SAEs  (7.4%),  and  AEs  leading  to  open-
label  treatment  discontinuation  (1.9%)  were  well  within  the  ranges  for  the  same  AE  categories 
reported for apixaban-treated subjects during the Treatment Periods of these studies.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  database  of  the  two  phase  3  studies  and  the  duration  of  exposure  were  considered 
adequate  to  investigate  the  safety  of  long  term  administration  of  apixaban  in  AF  patients.  In  study 
CV195030 VKA was used as comparator.  As shown in the efficacy section, the maintenance of an INR 
in  the  therapeutic  range  between  2-3  is  challenging  and  can  confound  any  claims  of  superiority  of 
efficacy  or  safety.  The  overall  AE  profile  of  apixaban  in  the  Phase  3  studies  was  similar  to  that  of 
warfarin  in  CV185030,  and  was  similar  to  that  of  ASA  in  CV185048.  As  could  be  expected,  the  most 
common drug-related AEs were related to bleeding. In line with the general results, the frequency of 
bleeding with apixaban was generally less than that reported with VKA, and comparable to or slightly 
higher than that reported with ASA.  
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 66/84 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reported  serious  events  with  outcome  death  were  reported  less  frequently  in  the  apixaban  arm 
compared to VKA or ASA, further supporting the efficacy data.  No new safety signals were detected in 
these studies. 
Adjudicated major  bleeding (adapted from ISTH guidelines) was the primary safety endpoint in both 
Phase 3 studies. The use of ISTH definitions of bleeding was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
In  study  CV185030,  apixaban  was  associated  with  significantly  less  risk  of  ISTH  major  bleeding 
composite of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding, and for all bleeds indentified by the investigator than VKA.  
Intracranial bleeding, including all adjudicated hemorrhagic strokes and intracranial bleeds reported by 
the investigator that were adjudicated as major bleeds, occurred with lower frequency in the apixaban 
group. These results were in line with the efficacy data showing a benefit for apixaban in reduction of 
haemorrhagic stroke compared to VKA. Individual components of major bleeding were also reported in 
lower frequencies in the apixaban group compared to the VKA group, except for intraocular bleedings. 
Additional analyses of major bleeding were performed taking INR levels into consideration. Study sites 
with better INR control still showed numerically better safety results in the apixaban group; although 
as  expected  the  efficacy  is  less  than  sites  with  worse  INR  control.  Also  in  study  sites  divided  by 
quartiles,  sites  with  INR  control  ≥  Median-  Q3  and  study  sites  ≥  Q3,  apixaban  shows  numerically 
better  results  and  acceptable  HR  [HR=0.87  (95%  CI:  0.70-1.08)  and  HR=0.7  (95%  CI:  0.48-1.03), 
respectively,  but  no  superiority  over  VKA.  Surprisingly,  this  difference  is  driven  by  difference  in 
bleeding  rates  reported  in  the  apixaban  in  addition  to  the  VKA  group.  The  MAH  clarified  that 
comparisons across the different TTR quartiles in the apixaban group are invalid as these are grouped 
by centre control of INR, and not based on patient's characteristics.  
The  frequency  of  bleeding  events  using  GUSTO  and  TIMI  criteria  were  in  line  with  the  other bleeding 
data, providing further reassurance of the safer profile of apixaban compared to VKA. 
In  Study  CV185048  apixaban  showed  numerically  higher  bleeding  rates  than  ASA. Analyses  of  major 
bleeding showed that the results were driven by the incidence of intraocular bleeding, in addition to a 
slightly higher incidence of the components of decrease in haemoglobin ≥ 2 gm/dl and transfusion ≥ 2 
units. A higher bleeding risk associated with apixaban compared to ASA was not surprising, considering 
the known pharmacodynamic properties of both agents.  
The MAH addressed the results of the subgroup of patients with Demonstrated VKA unsuitable. Data of 
this  subgroup  are  considered  more  relevant  as  it  represents  patients  with  prior  VKA  experience.  The 
other  60%  of  AVERROES  are  Expected  VKA  unsuitable  comprising  patients  who  were  considered  by 
their  physician  be  unsuitable  for  VKA  for  different  reasons,  without  actual  prior  experience  with  VKA. 
However, these 2 subgroups are shown to share the same baseline characteristics and CHADS2 score. 
The  investigator-identified  reasons  for  unsuitability  were  similar  for  both  treatment  groups.  These 
issues  support  that  patients  considered  to  be  Expected  VKA  unsuitable  reflect  the  experiences  of 
physicians  with  reasonable  judgement  of  the  suitability  of  these  patients  to  VKA  treatment,  and  that 
they are not actually different from patients with actual prior experience. 
The  Demonstrated  VKA  unsuitable  comprises  three  subgroups  mainly:  patients  with  a  history  of 
bleeding  on  VKA,  discontinued  VKA  due  to  bleeding,  and  combination  of  bleeding  risks.  Although  not 
the  bigger  subgroup  (40%  of  AVERROES),  they  actually  count  2237/5598,  which  was  considered  as 
adequate  representation.  Results  of  both  efficacy  and  safety  of  this  subgroup  are  in  line  with  the 
general  results  (Table  S9).  There  is  consistent  superiority  regarding  efficacy  (stroke  and  SE);  HR  of 
different  bleeding  endpoints  is  also  in  line  with  the  main  results.  Submitted  data  support  that  the 
general favourable results of apixaban is consistent in VKA naïve and experienced patients.

Intraocular  bleeding.  Data  from  both  studies  show  that  apixaban  was  associated  with  a  higher 
frequency of intraocular bleeding compared to either VKA or ASA. The frequency of different categories 
of  intraocular  bleeding  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  and  does  not  show  a  special 
prevalence  in  the  apixaban  group.  There  is  also  a  slight  imbalance  in  the  prevalence  of  diabetes  in 
study CV185030 which could explain the results at least in this study (among subjects with ISTH major 
intraocular bleeding 14/32 (43.8%) subjects in the apixaban group and 9/22 (40.9%) subjects in the 
warfarin  group).  Further  analysis  showed  no  clear  relationship  between  apixaban  and  specific 
intraocular pathology. The fact that the overall intraocular bleeding is lower for apixaban is reassuring. 
The small imbalance found in major intraocular bleeding can be a chance finding. The warning already 
included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  about  higher  haemorrhage  risk  is  considered  adequate  to  alert 
about possible bleeding events, including intraocular bleeding events. 
The cases of intramuscular bleeding with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal and pericardial ISTH 
major  bleeding  during  the  Treatment  Period  in  ARISTOTLE  and  AVERROES  are  summarised  in  Table 
S11 and indicate no concern for the profile of apixaban.

The comparable event rates for GI  bleeding reported in study CV185030 between apixaban and VKA 
is  reassuring  considering  recent  concerns  with  other  anti-thrombotics.  However,  results  compared  to 
ASA are less positive with a GI bleeding risk of GI bleedings reported as AEs in 2.7% (apixaban) and 
1.8% (ASA), mostly gingival and rectal. 
The  results  generally  support  that  apixaban  is  associated  with  a  lesser  bleeding  risk  than  VKA, 
however, one major advantage of VKA is the presence of an antidote in case of overdose.  In light of 
the  recent  concerns  with  other  anti-thrombotics  and  the  management  of  bleeding  in  clinical  practice, 
the development of an antidote to apixaban was considered important and the timeline regarding the 
developments of antidote were agreed with the CHMP and included into the RMP of this product. The 
MAH submitted data on the value of activated charcoal to decrease absorption. The SmPC sections 4.9 
and 4.5 were updated accordingly. The MAH explained that based on available clinical data, the most 
promising  agents  appear  to  be  prothrombin  complex  concentrate  (PCC)  and  factor  VII.  Two  recently 
published  studies  already  indicate  these  non-specific  prohaemostatic  agents  are  capable  of  reversing 
the anticoagulant effect of another anti factor X anticoagulant (rivaroxaban) in healthy volunteers.  
The proposal of the MAH to conduct a targeted bleeding questionnaire that will collect information on 
serious  bleeding  events  and  interventions  attempted  to  control  the  bleeding  was  considered 
appropriate.  The  protocol  of  the  questionnaire  was  agreed  to  be  assessed  by  the  CHMP  before 
implementing and included with timelines in the RMP as an “additional pharmacovigilance activity”.

The kit for monitoring anti-Xa activity (Rotachrom assay) was not used in clinical decisions during the 
ARISTOTLE  trial,  limiting  its  applicability  in  the  clinical  settings.  The  MAH  is  not  the  owner  of  the 
Rotachrom assay, and can not guarantee its commercial availability. However, the company discussed 
alternative  assays  like  that  by  STAGO.  Both  assays  are  currently  marketed  in  all  of  the  EU  member 
states,  according  to  the  MAH.  The  development  of  assay  to  measure  an  anticoagulant  activity  of 
apixaban was included together with timelines in the RMP. Importantly, there is the Rotachrom assay, 
with a LMWH standard, that could be used to assess apixaban exposure (expressed in LMWH units).  
Liver-related safety results. The MAH presented an adequate assessment of the liver-related safety 
aspects associated with apixaban use. This topic was also thoroughly discussed during the initial MAA 
assessment and apixaban liver profile was considered to be adequately reflected in the SmPC and RMP. 
The currently presented database is much wider with the addition of the whole phase 3 database in AF, 
which  specifically  addresses  the  AF  population.  Presented  data  do  not  indicate  a  safety  concern  for 
apixaban  compared  to  VKA  or  ASA.  The  small  imbalance  of  total  bilirubin  >1.5xULN  in  the  apixaban 
group vs. the pooled comparator group (3.3% vs. 2.9% respectively) was in the opinion of the CHMP 
driven  by  the  presence  of  a  slightly  larger  percentage  of  subjects  with  peak  total  bilirubin  >1.5xULN 
but  ≤2xULN  in  the  apixaban  group  than  in  the  comparator  group.  The  8  cases  of  cholestasis  and 
jaundice  of  hepatic  origin  reported  in  apixaban  group  did  not  have  a  common  cause  (underlying 
cancer,  cardiac  failure,  cholecystitis  and  cholelithiasis).  No  evidence  of  clinically  significant  bilirubin 
elevation in the apixaban group has been detected and no subgroup seems to be at an increased risk. 
The assessment of the reported cases of fatal outcome associated with hepatic toxicity was endorsed 
by  the  CHMP.  One  case  reported  as  possibly  related  to  apixaban  was  previously  assessed  in  a  FUM 
(CV185030-836-9443) and did not lead to any changes in the conclusions. Causality of apixaban in the 
case  CV185048-627-23  reported  as  possibly  related  is  confounded  by  the  co-administration  of  other 
hepatotoxic  co-medications  and  co-morbidities.  The  one  case  of  fatal  outcome  reported  in  non-AF 
studies  was  also  assessed  in  the  original  MAA  (CV185047-201-936).  In  the  opinion  of  the  CHMP 
current data do not point to the need of any further action, other than vigilant monitoring for any liver-
safety  events  in  post  marketing  data  assessments.  The  MAH  proposed  and  the  CHMP  agreed  to  add 
liver injury as a potential risk in the RMP.  
The  MAH  proposed  to  delete  the  recommendation  to  measure  LFT  before  therapy.  This  was  not 
endorsed. LFTs should be assessed before apixaban administration as the safety profile of apixaban is 
based  on  specific  exclusion  criteria  in  clinical  trials.  This  is  mentioned  in  the  SmPC  (Patients  with 
elevated  liver  enzymes  (ALT/AST  >2  x  ULN)  or  total  bilirubin  ≥1.5  x  ULN  were  excluded  in  clinical 
trials) and should be implemented in clinical practice to ensure a favourable safety profile. In addition, 
considering  that  AF  is  associated  with  multiple  co-morbidities,  in  particular  heart  failure  and  co-
administration  of  multiple  medicinal  products  is  expected  (some  of  them  are  hepatotoxic,  e.g., 
amiodarone, dronedarone) as currently reported in case CV185048-627-23 the measurement of LFT at 
the beginning of therapy should be advised and this is included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. This would 
constitute a value for further reference in case LFT elevations are noted during therapy. No regular LFT 
are considered necessary during long term treatment. 
Neurological  Adverse  events:  In the AF Studies 2 cases of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) both in 
the warfarin arm and 1 case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS in the warfarin arm were observed. 
There  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  risk  for  GBS  or  ALS  in  the  AF  population,  the  ongoing 
surveillance is considered acceptable. No new cases of GBS or ALS were reported. 
Subgroup  analysis showed that generally the results of investigated subgroups were in line with the 
main results. This confirms the favourable profile of apixaban over VKA even in vulnerable subgroups 
like  patients  above  75  years,  prior  stroke,  different  CHADS2  scores  and  renal  impairment.  However 
patients  with  diabetes  had  a  HR=0.96  (95%  CI:  0.74-1.25),  slightly  worse  results  than  the  general 
Eliquis

cohort.  The  MAH  addressed  this  issue  but  no  obvious  differences  in  patients  characteristics  were 
identified which could explain the slightly higher risk of ISTH major bleeding, except may be the lower 
frequency of patients with BMI ≤ 28 kg/m2 in the diabetic group (33.9% vs 45.9%). For "all bleeding" 
the results were comparable. Also the results of AVERROES are supportive that no relevant difference 
is found in the risk of bleeding between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. 
No conclusions can be made on females ≤50 years and blacks as the numbers of events were too few. 
Presented data in severe renal impairment do not strongly indicate a trend of higher risk of bleeding in 
patients who were administered 5 mg compared to the 2.5 mg, except when counting the ISH major 
bleedings/CRNM  bleedings  (7.45%  vs.4.22%).  The  lower  dose  is  currently  recommended  for  this 
subgroup.  Analysis  of  bleeding  in  patients  with  different  degrees  of  hepatic  impairment  was  not 
submitted as recruited patients were mostly with normal liver functions. 
Interactions. In study CV185030, there was an adequate representation of patients co-administered 
the  study  drug  with  ASA  (around  38%  in  each  group).  The  combined  use  of  apixaban  and  ASA  was 
generally accompanied with a lower bleeding risk than the co-administration of VKA+ASA. There were 
limited  representation  of  patients  co-administered  the  study  drug  +  ASA  +  a  thienopyridine  (around 
2%  in  each  group).  No  conclusions  can  be  made  on  this  triple  combination.  Current  SmPC 
recommendations are considered adequate to reflect the risk associated with such combinations. 
Discontinuations  due  to  AEs. In both studies discontinuation due to AES were numerically lower in 
the  apixaban  group  compared  to  the  VKA  or  ASA  groups.  In  study  CV185048,  more  patients 
discontinued in the apixaban group (n=35; 1.2%) due to bleeding compared to ASA (n=20; 0.7%). In 
the  subgroup  Demonstrated  VKA  unsuitable,  the  numbers  discontinued  for  bleeding  for  apixaban 
versus ASA were 8 versus 3 for subjects with bleeding on previous VKA, 3 versus 2 for subjects who 
had  previously  discontinued  VKA  due  to  bleeding,  and  10  versus  8  for  subjects  who  had  previously 
received  VKA  and  were  unsuitable  for  VKA  due  to  bleeding-related  reasons.  Not  all  of  the  bleeding 
events  resulting  in  study  drug  discontinuation  were  considered  clinically  important  enough  to  be 
adjudicated  as  major  bleeding.  Whereas  there  were  numerically  more  apixaban  discontinuations  for 
bleeding  in  patients  with  bleeding  on  previous  VKA  (8  vs.  3),  there  were  a  similar  number  of  major 
bleeding events (7 vs. 7) compared with ASA. The higher discontinuation rate in the ASA group seems 
to be driven by a higher number of ischemic events related to lower efficacy showed in the ASA group 
as compared to apixaban. 
Long  term  data.  The  presented  data  from  the  LTOLE  does  not  indicate  any  new  safety  issues.  The 
CHMP  recommend  to  submit  the  final  results  of  this  extension  phase  of  the  AVERROES  to  the  CHMP 
when available. 
Study CV185067 is a supportive safety study conducted in Japan. It is of little additive value due to the 
limited  database  (n=222).  Generally  results  are  in  line  with  what  is  already  presented  in  studies 
CV185030/048.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Results  of  study  CV185030  support  that  apixaban  is  associated  with  a  significantly  better  bleeding 
profile  than  VKA,  but  results  are  less  robust  when  taking  different  levels  of  INR  control  into 
consideration.  The  bleeding  risk  on  apixaban  is  numerically  higher  than  ASA,  which  is  expected. 
Presented  data  from  study  CV185048  is  insufficient  to  assess  if  apixaban  is  indeed  an  eligible 
alternative to patients unsuitable to VKA, in particular those with a higher bleeding risk. The lack of an 
antidote to apixaban is still a concern, but the MAH proposed adequate measures to address this issue. 
Incidence of liver injury was comparable in the studies, which was reassuring considering the available 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report

database.  However  as  this  is  based on  patients  with  normal  liver  functions,  LFT  should  be  performed 
prior to treatment to exclude unsuitable patients.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH fulfils the legislative 
requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The MAH submitted an updated risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan. 
Based on individual case review, the MAH has identified liver injury as an important potential risk with 
routine PV and risk minimization activities proposed for the AF indication. At the time of the approval of 
the  VTE  prevention  indication  hepatic  safety  has  been  thoroughly  discussed  and  was  adequately 
reflected  in  the  SmPC  and  RMP.  The  MAH  now  included  liver  injury  as  a  potential  risk  from  a 
precautionary point of view, which will allow to fit in ongoing pharmacovigilance activities in the overall 
risk management strategy. Furthermore, information on the important identified risks of bleeding and 
the potential risk of transient elevation of liver tests for the VTE prevention indication already existed 
in the RMP and are now presented for both indications in the updated RMP.  
For the newly introduced potential risk of liver injury, the MAH proposes and the CHMP agreed to the 
following pharmacovigilance activities: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Routine PV activities  
Continue blinded external liver expert review of prespecified liver cases 
Comprehensive  pivotal  study  clinical  safety  program  for  liver  related  events  (including 
supplemental case report forms) 
Targeted questions for spontaneous reports of liver events 
Ad hoc follow-up contact with the CHMP for specific severe liver events as needed 
Applicant commits to keep “hepatotoxicity” under close monitoring in the PSUR 
Also for the  newly introduced potential risk of liver injury with the AF indication, the MAH considered 
and  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  routine  risk  minimization  activities  are  sufficient.  Consistent  with  the 
recommendation for the indication of VTEp, LFTs will be assessed before apixaban administration. 
For  the  important  identified  risk  of  “bleeding,”  the  MAH  will  utilize  a  targeted  bleeding  questionnaire 
that  will  collect  information  on  serious  bleeding  events  and  interventions  attempted  to  control  the 
bleeding.  The  contents  of  the  questionnaire  will  be  submitted  for  the  CHMP  assessment  before 
implementing. 
The applicant amended the summary of the RMP as follows:

2.8.  User consultation 
A full user test was performed on the Package Leaflet (PL) for Eliquis 2.5mg in March and April 2010 
during  initial  marketing  authorisation  application.  A  bridging  study  for  PL  of  Eliquis  2.5mg  and  5  mg 
was  performed  in  October  and  November  2011  to  test  the  new  information  regarding  the  additional 
indication. The original and newly proposed PLs have a common design and layout. The bridging study 
successfully  tested  the  key  messages  relating  to  the  new  indication.  Key  similarities  in  PL  layout  and 
house style  have been described. It is therefore agreed that the results of the user consultation with 
target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet  submitted  by  the  MAH  show  that  the  package  leaflet 
meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package 
leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Apixaban  is  a  direct  reversible  inhibitor  of  the  coagulation  factor  Xa.  Apixaban  (2.5  mg  film-coated 
tablets) has been approved for the venous thromboembolic events prophylaxis in patients undergoing 
total  hip  or  knee  replacement  surgeries  in  May  2011.  Current  application  contains  grouped  variation 
and  a  line  extension  and  was  submitted  for  the  addition  of  apixaban  5  mg  film-coated  tablets  to 
support  a  new  proposed  indication  of  prevention  of  stroke  and  systemic  embolism  in  adult  patients 
with AF including those unsuitable for VKA with a recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily. The grouped 
variation contained a type II variation to add the newly proposed indication and a type IB variation to 
add a pack size of 168 tablets for Eliquis 2.5 mg film-coated tablets. The initial MAA for the 2.5 tablets 
already  included  sufficient  pharmacokinetic  data  to  support  the  marketing  authorisation  of  the  5  mg 
tablet, as the pharmacokinetics of both tablets were sufficiently investigated in the submitted phase I-
III studies for Eliquis 2.5 mg. All studies in this application were relevant for both strengths, and the 
2.5  and  5  mg  tablets  showed  linear  dose  proportionality  in  pharmacokinetics.  To  support  the  new 
indication the MAH submitted two new phase 3 studies.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Both  clinical  studies  (CV185030  and  CV185048)  investigate  the  primary  endpoints  of  stroke  and 
systemic  thromboembolism  which  are  relevant  endpoints  in  the  proposed  indication  and  have  been 
accepted in similar studies. 
In  study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE),  non-inferiority  of  apixaban  5  mg  BID  versus  warfarin  (INR  target 
range  2.0-3.0)  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  was  demonstrated  for  AF  patients  and  at  least  one 
additional risk factor for stroke. Superiority of apixaban was then assessed and demonstrated: annual 
event  rates  1.27%  versus  1.60%;  HR=0.79  [95%  CI=0.66;  0.95;  two-sided  p-value=  0.0114]. 
Sensitivity analysis confirmed the results. Analysis of stroke showed a lower incidence of hemorrhagic 
stroke in the apixaban group (0.42%) compared to VKA group (0.84%) and a lesser effect on ischemic 
stroke (1.74% vs 1.91% respectively), with comparable effect on SE (0.16% vs 0.18% respectively).  
Apixaban also showed a reduction in all-cause death, a secondary endpoint in the hierarchical testing 
strategy,  HR=0.89  [95%CI=  0.80;  1.00,  two-sided  p-value=0.0465].  Both  cardiovascular  deaths 
[HR=0.89;  95%CI  =0.76-  1.04]  and  non-cardiovascular  deaths  [HR=0.93;  95%CI=0.77-  1.13]  were 
numerically lower in the apixaban group. 
Efficacy  results  presented  in  different  subgroups  were  generally  consistent  with  the  primary  efficacy 
results for the study. In the subgroup of patients receiving the reduced dose of apixaban (2.5 mg BID), 
event rates favoured apixaban over VKA (1.43%/yr vs 7.23%/yr respectively, HR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.04, 
0.91).  
In  study  CV185048  (AVERROES)  apixaban  (1.62%/yr)  was  superior  to  ASA  (3.63  %/yr)  [HR=0.45; 
95%CI= 0.32- 0.62; two-sided p-value <0.00001] for the prevention of stroke or SE in subjects with 
AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke and who were considered not suitable for VKA by 
the  investigators.  The  majority  of  the  primary  outcome  events  were  ischemic  or  unspecified  strokes 
with  43  (1.53%)  events  in  the  apixaban  group,  versus  95  (3.4%)  events  in  the  ASA  group    [HR  = 
0.44;  95%  CI  =0.31,  0.63].  Apixaban  [n=2  (0.07%)]  was  also  associated  with  lower  numbers  in  SE 
relative to ASA [n=11 (0.39%)].  
Results within most subgroups were consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint. Results of patients 
with  demonstrated  VKA  intolerance  (apixaban:  1.73%  vs  ASA:  4.2%;  HR=0.33;  95%  CI:  0.19-0.56) 
Eliquis

were comparable to those expected to be intolerant (apixaban: 1.79% vs ASA: 3.25%; HR=0.55; 95% 
CI: 0.36-0.84). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
In  Study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE)  the  all  cause  death  was  investigated  as  a  secondary  endpoint  with 
borderline  significance  [HR=0.89;  95%CI=  0.80;  1.00,  two-sided  p-value=0.0465].  Superiority  of 
apixaban was less convincing in situations where INR control was well controlled. In the highest TTRc 
quartile (> 72.2%) benefit was shown for VKA over apixaban; HR =1.04 (95%CI: 0.82-1.33). Also no 
superiority was shown for apixaban over VKA in either components of all cause death (cardiovascular 
and non-cardiovascular deaths).  
The  general  benefit  of  apixaban  in  reduction  of  risk  of  stroke/SE  over  VKA  varied  according  to  the 
control of INR: benefit was observed in study sites with INR below the median quartile of INR control 
(HR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.62-0.98) but lost with INR ≥ median INR (HR=0.81; 95% CI: 0.61-1.08). Using 
TTRc, apixaban showed favourable results, with HR consistently below 1 (0.77-0.81) but no superiority 
compared to VKA; 95% CI varying from 0.57-1.07 to 0.52-1.26.  
Subgroups. In patients < 65 years, the primary efficacy endpoint was slightly higher in the apixaban 
group  than  VKA  group  (HR=1.16;  95%  CI:  0.77-  1.73).  The  MAH  explored  three  parameters  which 
could have led to worse results in patients <65 years, mainly: patients characteristics, VKA control and 
apixaban  exposure  in  the  ARISTOTLE  study.  Submitted  analyses  showed  that  none  of  these 
parameters  could  have  significantly  affected  the  results.  This  is  further  supported  by  data  from  the 
AVERROES study. It can be concluded that the trend for worse efficacy results in patients <65 years is 
probably  a  chance  finding.  Reduced  efficacy  was  showed  in  patients  randomized  in  the  EU:  HR  for 
stroke/SE= 0.92; (95% CI = 0.56; 1.52) and HR for all cause death= 0.89 (95% CI = 0.68; 1.18). In 
patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  generally  lower  events  rates  were  reported  in  the  apixaban 
group compared to the warfarin group, with more favourable results in patients administered 2.5 mg 
BID (n=89) (1.43%/yr vs 7.23%/yr, HR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.91), than patients administered 5 mg 
BID (n=48) (HR and upper bound of the associated 95% CI were ≥ 1; 95% CI was wide (0.43-34.72).  
The incidence of SE (0.2% and < 0.1%, respectively) and MI (0.3% and 0.2%, respectively) leading to 
study discontinuation in the apixaban group are slightly higher than the VKA group, and not in line with 
the efficacy data. This discrepancy occurs as one calculation is based on the investigator's assessment, 
the other is based on the  blinded adjudication by an independent committee. When the same events 
are  assessed  by  the  latter  committee,  the  results  of  both  apixaban  and  warfarin  were  comparable. 
During the period from the end of Intended Treatment Period up to 30 days after the last dose of study 
medication, a total of 27 stroke/SE events in the apixaban group versus only 10 events occurred in the 
warfarin  group.  Further  analyses  showed  that  the  highest  risk  of  stroke/SE  was  seen  in  patients  not 
used to VKA (either VKA naïve, or on apixaban) switching to VKA. Most of the events in these switchers 
occurred 2 weeks after the switch. These findings support the view that this higher incidence of events 
is probably due to the difficulties associated with establishing an adequate INR in VKA naïve patients. 
The  late  onset  of  events  precludes  a  rebound  hypercoagulability  problem.  These  conclusions  can  also 
explain  the  slight  imbalance  of  mortality  (apixaban=53;  VKA=48)  following  discontinuation  of  these 
anticoagulants.  
In study CV185048 (AVERROES) the definitions used to define VKA unsuitability were quite subjective, 
and depend on the perception of both the investigator and the patient, making it difficult to ascertain 
their true unsuitability for VKA treatment. Only 40% of the patients had prior VKA experience. In this 
subgroup, the actual representation of patients who discontinued VKA due to bleeding was very small 
(11.9%) and even the majority of these patients reported mainly minor bleedings. The most common 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 78/84 
 
 
 
 
reasons  provided  for  discontinuation  of  VKA  were  physician's  decision  (20.4%),  patient’s  decision 
(19.7%), and difficulty to control INR (19.1%). Further exploration of the recruited subgroups showed 
that the investigator gave “CHADS2 score = 1 and physician does not recommend VKA” as a reason for 
VKA  unsuitability  for  1195  subjects.  Of  this  group,  612  patients  included  “physician  does  not 
recommend”  as  the  only  reason  given  for  VKA  unsuitability.  In  AVERROES,  the  decision  that  VKA 
therapy was unsuitable was made for all 2142 patients with a CHADS2 score of ≤1, whether or not the 
investigator indicated that a low CHADS2 score was the reason for VKA unsuitability, either as one of 
multiple reasons or as the sole reason.  
The choice of ASA as a valid comparator for all VKA unsuitable patients was not fully supported by the 
CHMP.  According  to  the  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  of  the  European  Society  of  Cardiology  for  the 
management  of  patients  with  AF,  ASA  could  be  chosen  as  an  alternative  to  VKA  in  patients  with  a 
higher risk of bleeding. For the rest of the patients, a combination of ASA and clopidogrel could now be 
considered, however this combination was not approved at the time the study was initiated. 
Discontinuation  of  double-blind  study  drug  due  to  bleeding  was  infrequent  for  both  apixaban  (1.2%) 
and  for  ASA  (0.7%)  treatment  arms  and  similar  for  Expected  VKA  unsuitable  and  Demonstrated  VKA 
unsuitable  cohorts.  The  subgroup  of  patients  with  CHADS2  =1  and  investigator  did  not  recommend 
VKA was the only subgroup with conflicting results (HR= 2.18; 95% CI; 0.040- 11.91). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database of the two phase 3 studies consisted of 11,886 patients administered apixaban (5 
mg  BID  or  2.5  mg  BID)  with  a  mean  double-blind  exposure  of  1.7  years  (ARISTOTLE)  and  1.1  years 
(AVERROES). The overall AE profile of apixaban in the Phase 3 studies was similar to that of warfarin in 
CV185030 (ARISTOTLE), and to that of ASA in CV185048 (AVERROES). The event rates for bleeding-
related AEs  were lower for apixaban  vs. warfarin (25.2% and 32.7%, respectively). The frequency of 
bleeding-related  AEs  for  apixaban  vs.  ASA  was  similar  (10.0%  and  9.3%),  respectively.  The  overall 
frequency of drug-related AEs with onset during the Treatment Period was similar in the apixaban and 
comparator  groups.  In  CV185030,  drug-related  AEs  were  reported  for  27.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
apixaban  group  and  34.2%  in  the  warfarin  group.  Drug-related  AEs  reported  for  ≥2%  of  subjects  in 
either  group  included  epistaxis  (apixaban  5.0%;  warfarin  6.1%),  haematoma  (apixaban  1.4%; 
warfarin  3.5%),  contusion  (apixaban  1.7%;  warfarin  3.2%),  haematuria  (apixaban  2.6%;  warfarin 
3.2%), gingival bleeding (apixaban 1.0%; warfarin  2.1%), and ecchymosis (apixaban 0.9%; warfarin 
2.0%).  In  CV185048,  the  frequency  of  drug-related  AEs  was  similar  in  the  two  treatment  groups 
(apixaban 16.6%, ASA 16.7%). No drug-related AEs were reported in ≥2% of subjects in either group. 
During the Follow-up Period, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the apixaban and 
comparator groups for the frequency of AEs in either study (3.3% in the apixaban group and 3.4% in 
the warfarin group in CV185030; apixaban 7.2%, ASA 7.8% in CV185048).   
In study CV185030 (ARISTOTLE), SAEs with outcome of death were reported in 4.7% and 5.2% in the 
apixaban and VKA groups respectively. The lower incidence of death in the apixaban was also shown 
compared  to  either  VKA  naïve/experienced  patients  (apixaban  5.7%  vs  VKA  naïve  6%;  and  apixaban 
4% vs VKA experienced 4.5%). During the treatment period in this study the frequency of  SAEs was 
similar in the overall apixaban (35.0%) and warfarin (36.5%) groups, in  warfarin/VKA-naïve subjects 
(34.5%  and  36.0%  respectively)  and  warfarin/VKA-experienced  subjects  (35.4%  and  36.9% 
respectively).  In  study  CV185048  (AVERROES)  SAEs  with  outcome  of  death  were  reported  slightly 
more frequently in the ASA group (4.1%) compared to apixaban (3.3%). The overall frequency of SAEs 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 79/84 
 
 
 
 
with onset during the treatment period was 23.5% in the apixaban group vs. 28.9% in the ASA group. 
The most common SAEs were cardiac disorders in both studies.  
Adjudicated  major  bleeding  (adapted  from  ISTH  guidelines)  was  the  primary  safety  endpoint  in  both 
Phase  3  studies.  In  study  CV18030  (ARISTOTLE),  apixaban  was  superior  to  warfarin  for  ISTH  major 
bleeding  [HR=0.69;  (95%  CI=  0.60;  0.80);  two-sided  p<0.0001  (pre-specified  sequential  testing 
strategy). A similar effect was observed for the composite of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding, and for all 
bleeds  indentified  by  the  Investigator  [HR=0.68;  95%  CI=0.61;  0.75);  two-sided  p<0.0001,  for 
major/CRNM; HR=0.71; [(95% CI= 0.68; 0.75); two-sided p<0.0001 for all bleeds)].  The frequency 
of  the  individual  components  of  major  bleeding  was  generally  lower  or  similar  in  the  apixaban  group 
compared  with  the  warfarin  group  except  intraocular  bleeding.  In  study  CV185048  (AVERROES),  the 
observed event rate for adjudicated adapted ISTH major bleeding was 45 subjects (1.41%/year) in the 
apixaban  group  and  29  subjects  (0.92%/year)  in  the  ASA  group  [HR=1.54  (95%CI:  0.96-2.45); 
p=0.07]. Analyses of major bleeding showed that the results are driven by the incidence of introcular 
bleeding in addition to a slightly higher incidence of the components of decrease in haemoglobin ≥ 2 
gm/dl  (0.44%/yr  and  0.38%/yr  respectively)  and  transfusion  ≥  2  units  (0.5%/yr  and  0.41%/yr 
respectively).   
Event  rates  for  GI  bleeding  (including  upper  GI,  lower  GI,  and  rectal  bleeding)  reported  by  the 
investigator  and  adjudicated  as  major  bleeding  in  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE)  were  1.30%/year  in  the 
apixaban group and 1.44%/year in the warfarin group. In study CV185048 (AVERROES), GI bleedings 
were reported as AEs in 2.7% (apixaban) and 1.8% (ASA), mostly gingival and rectal. 
Subgroup  analysis  did  not  show  relevant  differences  for  the  investigated  subgroups  from  the  main 
cohort of either study in the bleeding risk.  
Current safety database does not indicate an increased risk for hepatotoxicity associated with apixaban 
use however LFTs should be assessed before apixaban administration as the safety profile of apixaban 
is based on specific exclusion criteria in clinical trials. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In  study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE),  bleeding  was  investigated  as  a  secondary  endpoint.  A  better 
bleeding profile is not consistently shown when INR control is taken into account: in study sites divided 
by quartiles, sites with INR control ≥ Median, Q3 and study sites ≥ Q3, apixaban showed numerically 
better results but not consistently superior to VKA [HR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.70-1.08) and HR=0.7 (95% 
CI: 0.48-1.03), respectively. 
Both strengths (2.5 mg BID or 5 mg BID) were administered to patients with severe renal impairment. 
There was no indication of a higher risk of bleeding in patients administered 5 mg compared to the 2.5 
mg, except when counting the ISH major bleedings/CRNM bleedings (7.45% vs. 4.22% respectively). 
Apixaban was associated with better results in patients randomised in Europe: HR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.62, 
1.02]  but  of  a  lesser  magnitude  in  the  EU  member  states  analysis  HR  0.90  (95%  CI:  0.66,  1.22),  in 
line with the efficacy data. Patients with diabetes had a HR=0.96 (95% CI: 0.74-1.25), slightly worse 
than  the  general  cohort.  No  obvious  differences  in  patients  characteristics  could  explain  this  results 
except may be the lower frequency of patients with BMI ≤28 kg/m2 in the diabetic group (33.9% vs. 
45.9%). For "all bleeding" the results were comparable. Also, in the results of AVERROES no relevant 
difference was found in the risk of bleeding between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. 
In study CV185048 (AVERROES), the "demonstrated VKA unsuitable" included three specific subgroups 
(bleeding  on  VKA,  discontinued  VKA  due  to  bleeding,  and  combination  of  bleeding  risks).  In  each  of 
these  3  subgroups,  apixaban  demonstrates  a  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  compared  to  ASA.  Also 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 80/84 
 
 
 
 
results of the subgroup of patients with CHADS2=1 and physician not recommending VKA showed the 
highest  HR  =3.4  (95%CI:  0.36-33.06).  However,  the  number  of  endpoints  was  too  few  to  allow  any 
conclusions. Further analysis shows that the risk in the subgroup of CHADS≤1 [Major bleeding HR 1.79 
(0.52, 6.11)] is in line with the general results of the study.  
Data  from  both  studies  show  that  apixaban  was  associated  with  a  higher  frequency  of  intraocular 
bleeding  compared  to  either  VKA  or  ASA.  In  study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE),  intraocular  bleeding 
adjudicated as major bleeding were reported in 32 cases with apixaban vs 22 cases reported with VKA; 
in  study  CV185048:  6  cases  (0.21%)  in  the  apixaban  group  vs  0  cases  in  the  ASA  group.  The 
frequency  of  different  categories  of  intraocular  bleeding  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups 
and does not show a special prevalence in the apixaban group. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Apixaban was associated with significant reduction in the risk of stroke and SE compared to VKA. The 
results  are  clinically  relevant  considering  that  VKA  is  the  standard  of  therapy  in  this  population. 
Apixaban  also  compares  favourably  with  available  published  data  of  other  new  anti-thrombotics,  like 
dabigatran  and  rivaroxaban,  but  direct  comparison  is  lacking.  A  reduction  in  the  incidence  of 
haemorrhagic  stroke  appears  to  be  the  main  driving  endpoint  for  the  benefit,  highlighting  that 
apixaban  is  probably  a  safer  alternative  to  VKA,  rather  than  a  more  effective  one.  Apixaban  was 
associated  with  a  significant  reduction  in  all  cause  death,  but  superiority  is  lost  in  subgroups  with 
better  INR  control.  A  significantly  lower  incidence  of  major  bleeding  is  observed  with  apixaban 
compared to VKA, which further supports the favourable profile of apixaban. Again results are of lower 
significance  when  INR  is  well  controlled.  This  questions  an  extra  benefit  of  apixaban  in  patients  who 
have  well  controlled  INR,  though  still  in  these  patients  apixaban  can  offer  other  advantages  like  the 
absence  of  monitoring.  It  is  reassuring  that  most  of  the  investigated  subgroups  showed  a  consistent 
benefit  over  VKA  regarding  the  bleeding  profile,  in  particular  elderly  patients  or  patients  with  renal 
impairment.  Importantly  also  there  was  no  increased  risk  of  GI  bleeding  compared  to  VKA,  as  was 
reported with dabigatran.  
Considering  the  results  of  study  CV185030  (ARISTOTLE)  the  superiority  of  apixaban  over  ASA  in 
reducing the risk of stroke/SE shown in AVERROES was not surprising.  Most of the recruited patients 
were not shown to have a high bleeding risk on VKA. In addition, 60% of the recruited patients did not 
even have prior VKA experience questioning the external validity of the study results. A non-significant 
higher  rate  of  bleeding  was  reported  in  the  apixaban  group  compared  to  ASA,  which  is  generally 
reassuring.  Further  analysis  of  the  results  showed  that  both  these  subgroups  (VKA  experienced  or 
naïve)  share  common  characteristics,  stroke  risk  and  more  importantly  the  benefit  risk  balance, 
supporting  that  the  results  of  VKA  experienced  can  be  extrapolated  to  VKA  naïve  patients.  However, 
the decision that these patients are not eligible for VKA in the first place is a subjective decision that is 
not clearly defined. The main reasons why these patients were considered to be intolerant to VKA was 
inability/unlikely  to  obtain  regular  INR  (42%)  or  patient  refusal  to  be  administered  VKA  (37%).  In  a 
strictly  medical  sense,  a  label  including  "patients  unsuitable  for  VKA"  as  proposed  by  the  MAH  would 
not  specifically  include  the  above  groups,  but  more  importantly  would  be  referring  to  patients  who 
have  discontinued  VKA  due  to  bleeding.  These  patients  constitute  only  266  patients  in  AVERROES. 
Patients who are unsuitable to VKA due to increased bleeding risk have not been specifically studied. 
Thus, the data in itself are not robust enough to support the inclusion of patients who are unsuitable to 
VKA in the indication. 
Eliquis 
CHMP assessment report

There is a slightly higher rate of stroke/SE and death recorded in the apixaban group compared to the 
VKA in the 30 days period following study drug discontinuation. Analysis showed that the highest risk 
of stroke/SEE is seen in patients not using VKA (either VKA naïve, or on apixaban) switching to VKA. 
Most  of  the  events  in  these  switchers  occurred  2  weeks  after  the  switch,  supporting  that  this  is 
probably due to the difficulties associated with establishing an adequate INR in VKA naïve patients. The 
late  onset  of  events  precludes  a  rebound  hypercoagulability  problem.  These  conclusions  can  also 
explain  the  slight  imbalance  of  mortality  (apixaban=53;  VKA=48)  following  discontinuation  of  these 
anticoagulants. The proposals in section 4.2 of the SmPC addressing the switch were considered by the 
CHMP acceptable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In general, the benefit risk of apixaban in patients with AF is favourable. Apixaban was associated with 
a significantly lesser risk of stroke/SE, all cause death and bleedings compared to VKA. The inclusion of 
patients defined as VKA unsuitable was however, not supported. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Apixaban has shown to be a beneficial anti-thrombotic for the prevention of stroke/SE in AF patients, 
with  no  extra  burden  in  the  bleeding  risk  compared  to  VKA.  Benefits were  smaller  in  subgroups  with 
better  INR  control,  but  this  is  still  an  acceptable  effect  considering  that  apixaban  offers  other 
advantages  over  VKA,  like  a  more  favourable  interaction  profile  and  no  need  for  routine  monitoring. 
The main disadvantage of apixaban compared to VKA is still the lack of a specific antidote or a method 
to monitor anticoagulant activity (which can be necessary in emergency situations), disadvantages also 
shared with dabigatran and rivaroxaban. This can clearly constitute a major concern in clinical practice, 
especially with chronic use as in AF patients. The MAH has presented some data to show that apixaban 
absorption  can  be  decreased  by  charcoal  and  elimination  could  be  improved  by  dialysis.  In  addition, 
the MAH submitted adequate plans for the development of a specific antidote and they were included 
in  the  RMP  for  apixaban.  In  addition,  the  MAH  agreed  to  use  of  a  questionnaire  to  document  the 
management  of  bleeding  in  clinical  practice.  The  protocol  for  the  questionnaire  will  be  submitted  for 
the  assessment  of  the  CHMP  and  was  included  as  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  in  the  RMP. 
Regarding  the  monitoring  of  the  anticoagulant  activity,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  develop  an  assay, 
and the details of the development plans were also included in the RMP for apixaban. Importantly, the 
Rotachrom  assay  with  a  LMWH  standard  is  available  in  the  EU  and  that  could  be  used  to  assess 
apixaban exposure (expressed in LMWH units). 
Results pertaining to comparisons of apixaban and VKA in all cause death and bleeding were presented 
in the SmPC.  
The use of apixaban as an alternative to patients unsuitable to VKA was not supported, as the criteria 
defining  this  unsuitability  was  considered  by  the  CHMP  as  too  subjective.  Actual  representation  of 
patients who discontinued VKA due to bleeding was very limited. The main study results were included 
in the labelling. 
The transition of patients on apixaban to other anti-coagulants was adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
Further analysis of benefits and bleeding risks in certain subgroups which were originally shown to be 
of  concern  is  currently  seen  to  be  in  line  with  the  general  results.  This  concerns  patients  below  65 
years  old  and  diabetic  patients.  Analysis  of  data  showed  that  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment 
should be administered the lower dose and this was included in the SmPC.

Assessment of liver safety data did not indicate the need of further action. The vigilant monitoring as a 
potential  risk  was  endorsed.  A  detailed  report  was  submitted  analyzing  all  available  safety  data  with 
reassuring  conclusions.  However,  this  wide  database  excluded  patients  with  any  form  of  hepatic 
impairment. This information was included in the SmPC along the recommendation to perform the liver 
function tests before administration to ensure safe use. 
During the assessment of this application some important GCP issues were raised in ARISTOTLE study 
regarding possible errors in medication dispensing, integrity of the interactive voice responses system 
and the discrepancies between the trial database and the data collected on the eCRF. All the concerns 
were  convincingly  explained  by  the  MAH  and  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  conclusions  of  the  GCP 
inspection to consider ARISTOTLE study to be GCP compliant.

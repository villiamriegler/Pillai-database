SmPC, Annex 
Results of a cross-study analysis suggest that the exposure 
include information on patients with renal 
impairment following the completion of study 
104864/722. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the MAH 
proposed this opportunity to bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version 9.0.

II, Labelling 
to topotecan lactone, the active moiety following topotecan 
and PL 
administration, increases at decreased renal function. The 
recommended monotherapy dose of oral topotecan in 
patients with small cell lung carcinoma with a creatinine 
clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min is 1.9 mg/m2/day for 
five consecutive days. If well tolerated, the dose may be 
increased to 2.3 mg/m2/day in subsequent cycles (see 
section 5.2). Insufficient data are available to make a 
recommendation for patients with a creatinine clearance < 
30 ml/min. Topotecan is not recommended to be used in 
these patients. 
Korean patients with renal impairment had generally higher 
exposure than non-Asian patients with the same degree of 
renal impairment.  The clinical significance of this finding is 
unclear, but the data in Korean patients suggest that a 
further lowering of dose may be required in these patients. 
There is no data from Asian patients with renal impairment 
other than Koreans.

Following the assessment of the 9th PSUR (PSU 014), the

CHMP requested the MAH to submit cumulative reviews on 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
Update to sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC 
regarding severe bleeding, pancytopenia, potential 
fatal outcome of sepsis and interstitial lung disease, 
dehydration as a consequence of severe diarrhoea as 
agreed by the CHMP following the assessment of 
FUM 019. Annex II has been updated in order to 
include the latest version number of the RMP 
(version 03).The MAH has taken the opportunity of 
this procedure to update the local representative 
contact details from Denmark and Cyprus, and to 
make further editorial amendments to the Product 
Information (SmPC, Annex II, Package Leaflet) as 
part of the PIM pre-migration exercise. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
fatal pulmonary events, fatal cases with febrile 
neutropenia, sepsis and septic shock, serious infections and 
fatal cases with thrombocytopenia and/or haemorrhages by 
indication, to discuss the need to update section 4.8 on the 
potential fatal outcome of interstitial lung disease and 
neutropenic complications such as sepsis and septic shock 
and if the dose reduction suggestions in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC in case of bone marrow toxicity should be revised.  
In their responses submitted as FUM 019, the MAH 
proposed to update the RMP and the SmPC concerning the 
risk of severe bleeding (associated with thrombocytopenia), 
potential fatal outcome of sepsis and interstitial lung 
disease, dehydration as a consequence of severe diarrhoea 
and additional information on proactive management of 
diarrhoea and management of severe diarrhoea, and 
pancytopenia. The MAH has hereby submitted a type II

This type II variation concerns an update of section 4.4 of 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Labelling and 
the SPC with a warning regarding the underlying risk 
PL 
factors of interstitial lung disease, further to a request from 
the CHMP.  
Topotecan has been associated with reports of interstitial 
lung disease, some of which have been fatal. Underlying 
risk factors include history of ILD, pulmonary fibrosis, lung 
cancer, thoracic exposure to radiation and use of 
pneumotoxic drugs and/or colony stimulating factors. 
Patients should be monitored for pulmonary symptoms 
indicative of interstitial lung disease (e.g. cough, fever, 
dyspnoea and/or hypoxia), and topotecan should be 
discontinued if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 
The frequency of this adverse event has also been updated

in section 4.8 of the SPC. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly.  
The MAH also proposed to update section 4.2 with a 
clarification regarding the use of prophylactic G-CSF for 
chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to align with the 
product information of the IV formulation . In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to make minor editorial changes 
to the SPC, labelling and Package Leaflet and to update the 
list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

new route of administration of Hycamtin, 0.25 mg and 1 
mg hard capsules. From a clinical efficacy and safety 
perspective the application relied on data already assessed 
in relation to variation EMEA/H/C/123/II/34.  
The approved indication for capsules Hycamtin is restricted 
to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and reads: 
HYCAMTIN capsules are indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) for whom re-treatment with the first-line 
regimen is not considered appropriate (see section 5.1).

of the SPC to include information on the risk of 'neutropenic

Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make some 
editorial changes to the SPC. 
Topotecan-induced neutropenia can cause neutropenic 
colitis. Fatalities due to neutropenic colitis have been 
reported in clinical trials with topotecan. In patients 
presenting with fever, neutropenia, and a compatible 
pattern of abdominal pain, the possibility of neutropenic 
colitis should be considered.

The MAH applied for a type II variation to update section 
Package Leaflet 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
4.8 of the SPC based on a review of cases of dehydration 
following treatment with topotecan. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the Package Leaflet in line 
with the outcome of consultation with target patient groups 
Page 20/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on readability aspects, to add the contact details for 
Bulgaria and Romania to the list of local representatives 
and to update the contact details of  the local 
representative in the UK.   
A review of Clinical trials in ovarian carcinoma and NSCLC 
including 1154 patients resulted in 38 reports of patients 
who experienced dehydration. Eight patients experienced 
grade 3 dehydration and 4 experienced grade 4 
dehydration. Dehydration occurred in 0.8% of patients. 
Post-marketing data revealed 255 reported cases (in some 
cases more than one occurrence in each patient) of 
dehydration during topotecan use, 241 of which originated 
from clinical trials. 41 and 78 episodes were classified as 
being cases of grade 3 and 4 dehydration. Most commonly 
the cases occurred in relation to 'nausea', 'vomiting', 
'diarrhoea' and/or 'anorexia' or other underlying conditions.  
In published literature cases of dehydration have been 
reported mostly without a demonstration of a direct causal 
relationship. 
The CHMP considers that the data available at present does 
not indicate a direct causal relationship between topotecan 
and dehydration, but rather an indirect effect. With 
reference to the product information, the Committee 
agreed with the MAH's proposal to update section 4.8 in 
order to further qualify the severity of the events that may 
lead to dehydration  ('anorexia', 'nausea', 'vomiting' and 
'diarrhoea').  
The CHMP also considers the report of the consultation with 
target patient groups and the related proposed changes to 
be acceptable.

SmPC 
The MAH applied for a type II variation, upon request by 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
the CHMP following the assessment of available paediatric 
data (OTH 010), to revise sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SPC to include information on use in paediatric patients 
based on the results from the Paediatric Oncology Group 
(POG) Studies 9275, 9275L and 9361. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to make a few minor editorial changes 
to section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Topotecan was evaluated in a paediatric population; 
however, only limited data on efficacy and safety are 
available and therefore, no recommendation for treatment 
of children with Topotecan can be given.   
In an open-label trial involving children (n = 108, age 
range: infant to 16 years) with recurrent or progressive 
solid tumours, topotecan was administered at a starting 
dose of 2.0 mg/m2 given as a 30-minute infusion for 5 
days repeated every 3 weeks for up to one year depending 
on response to therapy.  Tumour types included were 
Ewing's Sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, 
neuroblastoma, osteoblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.  
Antitumour activity was demonstrated primarily in patients 
with neuroblastoma. Toxicities of topotecan in paediatric 
patients with recurrent and refractory solid tumours were 
similar to those historically seen in adult patients. In this 
study, forty-six (43%) patients received G-CSF over 192 
(42.1%) courses; sixty-five (60%) received transfusions of 
Packed Red Blood Cells and fifty (46%) of platelets over 
139 and 159 courses (30.5% and 34.9%) respectively. 
Based on the dose-limiting toxicity of myelosuppression, 
the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 2.0

The pharmacokinetics of topotecan given as a 30-minute 
infusion for 5 days were evaluated in two studies. One 
study included a dose range of 1.4 mg/m2 to 2.4 mg/m2 in 
children (aged 2 up to 12 years, n = 18), adol

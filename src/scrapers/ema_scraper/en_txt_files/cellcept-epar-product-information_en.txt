1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
CellCept 250 mg hard capsules  
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each capsule contains 250 mg mycophenolate mofetil. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Capsules, hard (capsules) 
Oblong, blue/brown, branded with black "CellCept 250" on the capsule cap and "Roche" on the capsule 
body.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CellCept is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute 
transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists. 
Posology 
Use in renal transplant  
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in renal 
transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose).  
Paediatric population aged 2 to 18 years 
The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to a 
maximum of 2 g daily). Capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area of at least 
1.25 m2. Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed mycophenolate mofetil 
capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area greater than 
1.5 m2 may be prescribed mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As 
some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with 
adults, temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account 
relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction. 
Paediatric population < 2 years 
There are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient to 
make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended.

Use in cardiac transplant  
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in cardiac 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose).  
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. 
Use in hepatic transplant 
Adults 
Intravenous (IV) CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with 
oral CellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. 
Use in special populations 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a day 
for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly.  
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g administered 
twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose adjustments are 
needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see section 5.2). No data are 
available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. No 
data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant rejection 
does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of CellCept is not 
required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant rejection. No 
pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection.   
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, capsules should 
not be opened or crushed to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the 
powder contained in the capsules. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse eyes 
with plain water.

4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
CellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  
CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective 
contraception (see section 4.6).  
CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing a 
pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather 
than to the use of any specific agent.  
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be 
limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus associated nephropathy, JC virus associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis C have been 
reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often related to a high 
total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should 
consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or 
neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- and T-lymphocytes, therefore an 
increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in patients 
receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching 
CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to normal. Patients 
on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In 
cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be 
considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-
lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching CellCept to another 
immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports 
of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is 
recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are 
investigated. 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking CellCept 
should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third 
months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil 
count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination 
with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced PRCA is unknown. 
PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes to CellCept therapy 
should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimise the 
risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective and the 
use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be of value. 
Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
CellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including 
infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept should be 
administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  
CellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be avoided 
in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) 
such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in changes of 
MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. cholestyramine, antibiotics) 
should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma levels and efficacy of CellCept (see 
also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be appropriate when switching combination 
therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in 
patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or 
removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such 
concomitant administration has not been studied. 
The risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been established 
(see also section 4.5). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations  
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and congenital 
malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF exposure during 
pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no suitable alternative 
treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential should be made aware 
of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. contraceptive methods, 
pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians should ensure that women 
taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for effective contraception, and 
the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations when 
mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment should be 
taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable contraception 
(see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the 
therapy; unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two complementary forms of 
contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for contraceptive failure and 
unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity of 
mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need for 
pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male 
patients.  
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir 
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the phenolic 
glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not considered 
clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal 
impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, 
or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations 
of both substances may occur. 
Antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)  
Decreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium 
hydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. When 
comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking PPIs vs. 
CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. Theses data support extrapolation 
of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co-administered with 
magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was co-administered with 
PPIs. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A,  
antibiotics) 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of 
their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-
treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA (see 
section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the 
potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. 
In contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be 
expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30-
50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients receiving sirolimus 
or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, changes of MPA exposure 
should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the immunosuppressants which does not 
interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning the 
following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal transplant 
recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus 
clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to cease within a few 
days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not normally be necessary in 
the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring should be 
performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly 
administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole 
combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of 
MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced uridine 
diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and activity. When comparing 
rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles between CellCept patients with 
and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interaction were seen. 
Ganciclovir  
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate 
and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of CellCept (see 
section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents (which compete for 
mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. 
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and CellCept dose adjustment is not 
required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. 
valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and 
patients should be monitored carefully. 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted in a 
decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure 
levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is 
administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept was 
concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer 
intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on CellCept with phosphate 
binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the active 
metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, 
there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of CellCept (1.5 g 
BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant 
patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody response 
to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interaction 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG 
by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG, and 
thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, 
during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of 
contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
Pregnancy 
CellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy test result 
to rule out unintended use in pregnancy.  
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss and 
congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding pregnancy 
prevention and planning. 
Before starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum or 
urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended exposure of 
an embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 8 - 10 days after 
the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two tests 8 - 10 days 
apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a pregnancy test must 
be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test 8 - 10 days later. Pregnancy tests 
should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in contraception is reported). Results of all 
pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients should be instructed to consult their 
physician immediately should pregnancy occur.

Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the overall 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with 
immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
• 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept in combination with other 
immunosuppressants during pregnancy. The following malformations were most frequently 
reported:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia); 
Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  
Renal abnormalities. 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Microphthalmia; 
Congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
Septum pellucidum agenesis; 
Olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to 
mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing mothers (see section 
4.3). 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage 
following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on animal 
data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is so low that 
it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in animal studies at 
concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins, such that the risk of 
genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or their 
female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive potential 
should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential risks of 
fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
dose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study 
conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, agnathia, 
and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic 
exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CellCept has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
CellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients are 
advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%) and vomiting (up to 
39.1%) were among the most common and/or serious adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher 
frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency category 
for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 
to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Due 
to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions across the different 
transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and cardiac transplant 
patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any 
unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients 
were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections 
(some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic agents and latent 
viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section 4.4). The most 
serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and atypical 
mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 
3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic 
transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV viraemia/syndrome 
and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK 
virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including 
CellCept.  
Blood and lymphatic disorders  
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
haemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic 
anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see 
section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and haemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, oesophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often 
complicated by haemorrhage, as well as haematemesis, melena, and haemorrhagic forms of gastritis and 
colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common gastrointestinal 
disorders, however, were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with 
CellCept-related diarrhoea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been reported.  
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, mainly 
in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept 
in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with 
CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There have also 
been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal oedema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of the 
medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients aged 
2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were generally similar 
to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the following treatment-
related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, particularly in children under 6 
years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leucopenia, anaemia and infection.  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive 
regimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) 
and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger individuals.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-
marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose cases in 
which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal 
product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the 
immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If 
neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. Bile 
acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic recirculation 
of the drug (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, 
MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also influences 
cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It has been shown, using 
human CD4+ T-cells, that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a proliferative state 
to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic state of T-cells, whereby 
the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of acute 
rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is correlated with 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 
94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of 
mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients. However, 
MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable 
systemically in plasma following oral administration.  
Distribution 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually 
observed at approximately 6 - 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40% 
is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating that there is a significant 
amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. 
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower compared to 
the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). 
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via enterohepatic 
recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is pharmacologically active 
and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects (diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral administration 
of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose with 93% of 
the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the faeces. Most (about 87%) of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. However, 
at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By 
interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine 
reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP isoforms, 
MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the glucuronides’ 
biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, but its 
contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its metabolites 
potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; only 
apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease approximate 
clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were observed. In 
transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean half-life values 
shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant patients. In the 
individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment with other 
immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal function. These 
factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when CellCept is co-administered with cyclosporine (see 
section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over time compared to what is observed 
immediately after transplantation.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher relative 
to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment. The 
mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in 
subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the known renal 
elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal 
impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with 
severe chronic renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to that 
seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was 2 – 3-
fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a transient 
increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft 
function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected 
by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably depend on the 
particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, 
may show a different effect.  
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 years) 
given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC values similar 
to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in the early and late 
post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early and late post-
transplant period. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered in 
the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing 
ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or 
gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other 
immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of 
CellCept on the ovulation-suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and 
progesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not 
affected to a clinically relevant degree  by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) 
observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 times the 
systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose 
of 3 g/day. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. These effects can be 
related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells. 
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity. 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at these 
levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at 
the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic 
exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. Gastrointestinal 
and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose 
(systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile 
of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials, 
which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8).

Use in special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of CellCept for infusion in paediatric patients have not been established. No 
pharmacokinetic data with CellCept for infusion are available for paediatric renal transplant patients. No 
pharmacokinetic data are available for paediatric patients following hepatic transplants. 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal or hepatic transplant patients is 
appropriate for the elderly.  
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g administered 
twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose adjustments are 
needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see section 5.2). No data are 
available for hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease.  
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant rejection 
does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of CellCept is not 
required. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. 
Method of administration 
Following reconstitution to a concentration of 6 mg/ml, CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion must be administered by slow intravenous infusion over a period of 2 hours by either 
a peripheral or a central vein (see section 6.6). 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, avoid direct 
contact of the dry powder or prepared solutions of CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution 
for infusion with skin or mucous membranes. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and 
water; rinse eyes with plain water. 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 
6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
CellCept have been observed (see section 4.8). CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to polysorbate 80.

• 
• 
• 
• 
CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective 
contraception (see section 4.6).  
CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing a 
pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not to be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to 
prevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6).  
CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather 
than to the use of any specific agent.  
As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be 
limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis C have been 
reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often related to a high 
total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should 
consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or 
neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- and T-lymphocytes, therefore an 
increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in patients 
receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching 
CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to normal. Patients 
on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In 
cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be 
considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-
lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases, switching CellCept to another 
immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be 
linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports 
of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is 
recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are 
investigated. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking CellCept 
should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third 
months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil 
count < 1.3 x 103/µl) it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination 
with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced PRCA is unknown. 
PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes to CellCept therapy 
should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimise the 
risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, and 
the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be of 
value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
CellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including 
infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept should be 
administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  
CellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be avoided 
in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) 
such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in changes of 
MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. cholesterolamine, antibiotics) 
should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma levels and efficacy of CellCept (see 
also section 4.5). Some degree of enterohepatic recirculation is anticipated following intravenous 
administration of CellCept. Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be appropriate when switching 
combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or to ensure adequate 
immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, treatment with 
antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such 
concomitant administration has not been studied. 
The risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been established 
(see also section 4.5). 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and congenital 
malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF exposure during 
pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no suitable alternative 
treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential should be made aware 
of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. contraceptive methods, 
pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians should ensure that women 
taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for effective contraception, and 
the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations when 
mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment should be 
taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable contraception 
(see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the 
therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two complementary forms of 
contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for contraceptive failure and 
unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity of 
mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need for 
pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male 
patients. 
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir  
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the phenolic 
glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not considered 
clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal 
impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, 
or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion, and further increases in concentrations 
of both substances may occur. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, 
antibiotics) 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of 
their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose, oral administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects 
pre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA 
(see section 4.4, and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of 
the potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. 
In contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be 
expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30 - 
50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients receiving sirolimus 
or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, changes of MPA exposure 
should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the immunosuppressants which does not 
interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning the 
following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid  
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal transplant 
recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus 
clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to cease within a few 
days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in 
overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not normally be necessary in 
the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring should be 
performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly 
administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole 
combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. 
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of 
MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced uridine 
diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and activity. When comparing 
rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles between CellCept patients with 
and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interaction were seen. 
Ganciclovir 
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate 
and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of CellCept (see 
section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents (which compete for 
mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. 
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and CellCept dose adjustment is not 
required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. 
valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and 
patients should be monitored carefully. 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted in a 
decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure 
levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is 
administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept was 
concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is 
recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer 
intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on CellCept with phosphate 
binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the active 
metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, 
there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of CellCept (1.5 g 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant 
patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody response 
to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interaction 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG 
by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG, and 
thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, 
during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of 
contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
Pregnancy 
CellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy test result 
to rule out unintended use in pregnancy.   
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss and 
congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding pregnancy 
prevention, and planning. 
Before starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum or 
urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended exposure of 
an embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 8 - 10 days after 
the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two tests 8 - 10 days 
apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a pregnancy test must 
be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test 8 - 10 days later. Pregnancy tests 
should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in contraception is reported). Results of all 
pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients should be instructed to consult their 
physician immediately should pregnancy occur. 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the overall 
• 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with 
immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  
Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida; 
Renal abnormalities. 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Microphthalmia; 
Congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
Septum pellucidum agenesis; 
Olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to 
mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing mothers (see section 
4.3). 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage 
following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on animal 
data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is so low that 
it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in animal studies at 
concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins such that the risk of 
genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or their 
female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and 
for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive potential 
should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential risks of 
fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose of 2 g/day. In a female fertility and reproduction study conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day 
caused malformations (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation 
offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 
times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
CellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients are 
advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%) and vomiting (up to 
39.1%) were among the most common and/or serious adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is also evidence of a higher 
frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency category 
for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 
to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Due 
to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions across the different 
transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal and hepatic transplant patients.

Adverse reactions attributable to peripheral venous infusion were phlebitis and thrombosis, both observed 
at 4% in patients treated with CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes 
in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at 
least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections 
(some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic agents and latent 
viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section 4.4). The most 
serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis tuberculosis and atypical mycobacterial 
infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g daily) with 
other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal and hepatic transplant patients followed for 
at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV viraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The 
proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated 
nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), 
have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept. 
Blood and lymphatic disorders  
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
haemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic 
anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal.  
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see 
section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired 
neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and haemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, oesophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often 
complicated by haemorrhage, as well as haematemesis, melena, and haemorrhagic forms of gastritis and 
colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common gastrointestinal 
disorders, however, were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with 
CellCept-related diarrhoea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction, have been reported. 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, mainly 
in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept 
in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with 
CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There have also 
been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal oedema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of the 
medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive 
regimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) 
and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger individuals.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-
marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose cases in 
which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal 
product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the 
immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If 
neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. Bile 
acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic recirculation 
of the drug (see section 5.2).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code: L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, 
MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also influences 
cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It has been shown, using 
human CD4+ T-cells,  that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a proliferative state 
to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic state of T-cells, whereby 
the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to the active metabolite, MPA. The parent substance mycophenolate mofetil can be measured systemically 
during intravenous infusion. MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually 
observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40% 
is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating that there is a significant 
amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower compared to 
the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant).  
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via enterohepatic 
recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is pharmacologically active 
and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects (diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral administration 
of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose, with 93% 
of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in faeces. Most (about 87%) of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. However, 
at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By 
interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine, 
reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP isoforms, 
MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the glucuronides’ 
biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, but its 
contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its metabolites 
potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; only 
apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease approximate 
clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were observed. In 
transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean half-life values 
shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant patients. In the 
individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment with other 
immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal function. These 
factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when CellCept is co-administered with cyclosporine (see 
section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over time compared to what is observed 
immediately after transplantation. 
Equivalence with oral dosage forms 
MPA AUC values obtained following administration of 1 g BID intravenous CellCept to renal transplant 
patients in the early post-transplant phase are comparable to those observed following 1 g BID oral 
CellCept. In hepatic transplant patients, administration of 1 g BID intravenous CellCept followed by 1.5 g 
BID oral CellCept resulted in MPA AUC values similar to those found in renal transplant patients 
administered 1 g CellCept BID. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher relative 
to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment. The 
mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6 fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in 
subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the known renal 
elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal 
impairment has not been studied. No data are available for hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic 
renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0–12h was comparable to that 
seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was 2 – 3-
fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a transient 
increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft 
function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected 
by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably depend on the 
particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, 
may show a different effect.  
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered in 
the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing 
ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or 
gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other 
immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of 
CellCept on the ovulation-suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and 
progesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not 
affected to a clinically relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) 
observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day. 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. These effects can be 
related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells. 
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity. 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at  
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at these 
levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day (see section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose 
of 2 g/day. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic exposure levels equivalent to or 
less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with 
dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to 
or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be 
consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials, which now provide safety data of more 
relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8).

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Powder for oral suspension 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and 
corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, 
cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists. 
Posology 
Use in renal transplant 
Adults 
Treatment with 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension should be initiated within 72 hours following 
transplantation. The recommended dose in renal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g 
daily dose), i.e. 5 ml oral suspension twice daily. 
Paediatric population aged 2 to 18 years 
The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is 600 mg/m2 
administered twice daily (up to a maximum of 2 g/10 ml oral suspension daily). As some adverse 
reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary 
dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical 
factors including severity of reaction. 
Paediatric population < 2 years 
There are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient to 
make dosage recommendations, and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in cardiac transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in cardiac 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. 
Use in hepatic transplant 
Adults 
Intravenous (IV) CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with 
oral CellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. 
Use in special populations 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a day 
for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly.  
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g administered 
twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose adjustments are 
needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively. (see section 5.2). No data 
are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. No 
data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant rejection 
does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of CellCept is not 
required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant rejection. No 
pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection.  
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Note: If required, CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension can be administered via a nasogastric tube 
with a minimum size of 8 French (minimum 1.7 mm interior diameter). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, avoid inhalation 
or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes of the dry powder as well as direct contact of the 
reconstituted suspension with the skin. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; rinse 
eyes with plain water. 
For instruction on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
CellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  
CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective 
contraception (see section 4.6).  
CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing a 
pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather 
than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to 
sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high 
protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis C have been 
reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often related to a high 
total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should 
consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or 
neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- and T-lymphocytes, therefore an 
increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in patients 
receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching 
CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to normal. Patients 
on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be 
considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-
lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching CellCept to another 
immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be 
linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports 
of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is 
recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are 
investigated. 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking CellCept 
should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third 
months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil 
count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination 
with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced PRCA is unknown. 
PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes to CellCept therapy 
should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimise the 
risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised, that during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, and 
the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be of 
value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
CellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including 
infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept should be 
administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease. 
CellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be avoided 
in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) 
such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in changes of 
MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. cholestyramine, antibiotics) 
should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce plasma levels and efficacy of CellCept (see 
also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be appropriate when switching combination 
therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or 
removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such 
concomitant administration has not been studied. 
CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension contains aspartame. Therefore, care should be taken if 
CellCept 1 g/5 ml powder for oral suspension is administered to patients with phenylketonuria (see section 
6.1) 
The risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been established 
(see also section 4.5). 
This medicinal product contains sorbitol. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance 
should not take this medicine. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and congenital 
malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF exposure during 
pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no suitable alternative 
treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential should be made aware 
of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. contraceptive methods, 
pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians should ensure that women 
taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for effective contraception, and 
the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations when 
mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment should be 
taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable contraception 
(see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the 
therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two complementary forms of 
contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for contraceptive failure and 
unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity of 
mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need for 
pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male 
patients.  
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir  
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the phenolic 
glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not considered 
clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal 
impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, 
or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations 
of both substances may occur. 
Antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
Decreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium 
hydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. When 
comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking PPIs vs. 
CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. These data support extrapolation 
of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co- administered with 
magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was co-administered with 
PPIs. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A,  
antibiotics) 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of 
their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-
treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA. (see 
section 4.4, and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the 
potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. 
In contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be 
expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30 - 
50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients receiving sirolimus 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, changes of MPA exposure 
should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the immunosuppressants which does not 
interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning the 
following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal transplant 
recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus 
clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to cease within a few 
days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in 
overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not normally be necessary in 
the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring should be 
performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly 
administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole 
combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of 
MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced uridine 
diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and activity. When comparing 
rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles between CellCept patients with 
and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interaction were seen. 
Ganciclovir 
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate 
and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of CellCept (see 
section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents (which compete for 
mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. 
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and CellCept dose adjustment is not 
required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. 
valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and 
patients should be monitored carefully. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted in a 
decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure 
levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is 
administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept was 
concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is 
recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer 
intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on CellCept with phosphate 
binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the active 
metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, 
there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of CellCept (1.5 g 
BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant 
patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody response 
to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interaction 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG 
by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG, and 
thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, 
during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of 
contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
Pregnancy 
CellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy test result 
to rule out unintended use in pregnancy. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss and 
congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding pregnancy 
prevention and planning.  
Before starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum or 
urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended exposure of 
an embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 8 - 10 days after 
the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two tests 8 - 10 days 
apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a pregnancy test must 
be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test 8 - 10 days later. Pregnancy tests 
should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in contraception is reported). Results of all 
pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients should be instructed to consult their 
physician immediately should pregnancy occur.  
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3 % of live births in the overall 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with 
immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
• 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  
Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  
Renal abnormalities. 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Microphthalmia; 
Congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
Septum pellucidum agenesis; 
Olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to 
mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing mothers (see section 
4.3). 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage 
following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil.  
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on animal 
data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is so low that 
it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in animal studies at 
concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins such that the risk of 
genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or their 
female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and 
for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive potential 
should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential risks of 
fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
dose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study 
conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, agnathia, 
and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic 
exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CellCept has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
CellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients are 
advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%) and vomiting (up to 
39.1%) were among the most common and/or serious adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is evidence of a higher frequency 
of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency category 
for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 
to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Due 
to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions across the different 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and cardiac transplant 
patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any 
unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients 
were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections 
(some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic agents and latent 
viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section 4.4). The most 
serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and atypical 
mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 
3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic 
transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV viraemia/syndrome 
and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK 
virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including 
CellCept. 
Blood and lymphatic disorders  
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
haemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic 
anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal.  
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see 
section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired 
neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and haemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, oesophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often 
complicated by haemorrhage, as well as haematemesis, melena, and haemorrhagic forms of gastritis and 
colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common gastrointestinal 
disorders, however, were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with 
CellCept-related diarrhoea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported.  
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, mainly 
in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept 
in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with 
CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There have also 
been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal oedema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of the 
medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients aged 
2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were generally similar 
to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the following treatment-
related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, particularly in children under 6 
years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leukopenia, anaemia and infection.  
Elderly  
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive 
regimen may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) 
and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger individuals.  
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-
marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose cases in 
which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal 
product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the 
immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If 
neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. Bile 
acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic recirculation 
of the drug (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, 
MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also influences 
cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It  has been shown, using 
human CD4+ T-cells,  that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a proliferative state 
to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic state of T-cells, whereby 
the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of acute 
rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is correlated with 
MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 
94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of 
mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients. However, 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable 
systemically in plasma following oral administration.  
Distribution 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually 
observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40% 
is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating that there is a significant 
amount of enterohepatic recirculation. 
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. 
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower compared to 
the late post-transplant period (3 – 6 months post-transplant). 
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via enterohepatic 
recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is pharmacologically active 
and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’´s side effects (diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral administration 
of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose, with 93% 
of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the faeces. Most (about 87%) of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. However, 
at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By 
interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine, 
reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP isoforms, 
MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the glucuronides’ 
biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, but its 
contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its metabolites 
potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; only 
apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease approximate 
clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were observed. In 
transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean half-life values 
shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant patients. In the 
individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment with other 
immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal function. These 
factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when CellCept is co-administered with cyclosporine (see 
section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over time compared to what is observed 
immediately after transplantation.  
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher relative 
to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment. The 
mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in 
subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the known renal 
elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal 
impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with 
severe chronic renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to that 
seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12h was 2 – 3-
fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a transient 
increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft 
function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected 
by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably depend on the 
particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, 
may show a different effect. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 years) 
given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC values similar 
to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in the early and late 
post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early and late post-
transplant period. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered in 
the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared t#o younger patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing 
ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or 
gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other 
immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of 
CellCept on the ovulation-suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and 
progesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not 
affected to a clinically relevant degree  by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) 
observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 times the 
systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose 
of 3 g/day. 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. These effects can be 
related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells. 
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity. 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at these 
levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at 
the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic 
exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. Gastrointestinal 
and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose 
(systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile 
of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials, 
which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8).

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
CellCept is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of acute 
transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists. 
Posology 
Use in renal transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in renal 
transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population aged 2 to 18 years 
The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to a 
maximum of 2 g daily). Tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area greater 
than 1.5 m2, at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur with greater 
frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose reduction or 
interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including 
severity of reaction. 
Paediatric population < 2 years 
There are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient to 
make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended.

Use in cardiac transplant  
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in cardiac 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose).  
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. 
Use in hepatic transplant 
Adults 
Intravenous (IV) CellCept should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic transplant, with 
oral CellCept initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended oral dose in hepatic 
transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population  
No data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients 
Use in special populations 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a day 
for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. 
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate 
< 25 ml/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g administered 
twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose adjustments are 
needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see section 5.2). No data are 
available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. No 
data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant rejection 
does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of CellCept is not 
required. There is no basis for CellCept dose adjustment following cardiac transplant rejection. No 
pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, tablets should not 
be crushed.

4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
CellCept should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
CellCept have been observed (see section 4.8).  
CellCept should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly effective 
contraception (see section 4.6).  
CellCept treatment should not be initiated in women of childbearing potential without providing a 
pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to 
prevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). 
CellCept should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather 
than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk for skin cancer, exposure to 
sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high 
protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including CellCept, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis C have been 
reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often related to a high 
total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that physicians should 
consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with deteriorating renal function or 
neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- and T-lymphocytes, therefore an 
increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in patients 
receiving CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching 
CellCept to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum IgG levels returning to normal. Patients 
on CellCept who develop recurrent infections should have their serum immunoglobulins measured. In 
cases of sustained, clinically relevant hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be 
considered taking into account the potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-
lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received CellCept in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases switching CellCept to another 
immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be 
linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is 
recommended that patients who develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are 
investigated. 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving CellCept should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to CellCept itself, 
concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. Patients taking CellCept 
should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third 
months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil 
count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or discontinue CellCept. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept in combination 
with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil induced PRCA is unknown. 
PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of CellCept therapy. Changes to CellCept therapy 
should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in transplant recipients in order to minimise the 
risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving CellCept should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised that, during treatment with CellCept, vaccinations may be less effective, and 
the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may be of 
value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
CellCept has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse events, including 
infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation. CellCept should be 
administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system disease.  
CellCept is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it should be avoided 
in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) 
such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in changes of 
MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. cholestyramine, antibiotics) 
should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma level and efficacy of CellCept (see 
also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be appropriate when switching combination 
therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or to ensure adequate immunosuppression in 
patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, treatment with antibiotics, addition or 
removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that CellCept should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine because such 
concomitant administration has not been studied. 
The risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been established 
(see also section 4.5). 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and congenital 
malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF exposure during 
pregnancy. Therefore, CellCept is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no suitable alternative 
treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential should be made aware 
of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. contraceptive methods, 
pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with CellCept. Physicians should ensure that women 
taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, the need for effective contraception, and 
the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations when 
mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment should be 
taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable contraception 
(see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the 
therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two complementary forms of 
contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for contraceptive failure and 
unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation Holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity of 
mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need for 
pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to male 
patients.  
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir 
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the phenolic 
glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8%) were minimal and are not considered 
clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence of renal 
impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and aciclovir, 
or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in concentrations 
of both substances may occur. 
Antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
Decreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium 
hydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with CellCept. When 
comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between CellCept patients taking PPIs vs. 
CellCept patients not taking PPIs, no significant differences were seen. These data support extrapolation 
of this finding to all antacids because the reduction in exposure when CellCept was co- administered with 
magnesium and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when CellCept was co-administered with 
PPIs. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, 
antibiotics) 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because of 
their potential to reduce the efficacy of CellCept. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects pre-
treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40% reduction in the AUC of MPA (see 
section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the 
potential to reduce efficacy of CellCept. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. 
In contrast, if concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30% should be 
expected. CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30 - 
50% in renal transplant patients treated with CellCept and CsA compared with patients receiving sirolimus 
or belatacept and similar doses of CellCept (see also section 4.4). Conversely, changes of MPA exposure 
should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one of the immunosuppressants which does not 
interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning the 
following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal transplant 
recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus 
clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to cease within a few 
days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately represent changes in 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of CellCept should not normally be necessary in 
the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical monitoring should be 
performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when CellCept was concomitantly 
administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and metronidazole 
combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of CellCept. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed.  
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with CellCept.  
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and CellCept resulted in an approximately 30% decrease of 
MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing PPAR gamma (peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in an enhanced uridine 
diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and activity. When comparing 
rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles between CellCept patients with 
and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-
drug interaction were seen. 
Ganciclovir 
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral mycophenolate 
and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of CellCept (see 
section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of these agents (which compete for 
mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. 
No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is anticipated and CellCept dose adjustment is not 
required. In patients with renal impairment in whom CellCept and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. 
valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and 
patients should be monitored carefully. 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of CellCept and rifampicin resulted in a 
decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12h) of 18% to 70%. It is recommended to monitor MPA exposure 
levels and to adjust CellCept doses accordingly to maintain clinical efficacy when rifampicin is 
administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30% and 25%, respectively, were observed when CellCept was 
concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended, however, to administer CellCept at least one hour before or three hours after sevelamer 
intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. There are no data on CellCept with phosphate 
binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on CellCept and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax of MPA, the active 
metabolite of CellCept, were not significantly affected by co-administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, 
there was an increase of approximately 20% in tacrolimus AUC when multiple doses of CellCept (1.5 g 
BID) were administered to hepatic transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant 
patients, tacrolimus concentration did not appear to be altered by CellCept (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody response 
to other vaccines may be diminished (see also 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interaction 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of MPAG 
by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with MPAG, and 
thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular secretion. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting CellCept therapy, 
during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of 
contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
Pregnancy 
CellCept is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to prevent 
transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy test result 
to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss and 
congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding pregnancy 
prevention and planning. 
Before starting CellCept treatment, women of childbearing potential should have two negative serum or 
urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/ml in order to exclude unintended exposure of 
an  embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 8 - 10 days 
after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform two tests 8 - 10 
days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ availability), a pregnancy test 
must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further test 8 - 10 days later. Pregnancy 
tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in contraception is reported. Results of all 
pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients should be instructed to consult their 
physician immediately should pregnancy occur. 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3% of live births in the overall 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated with 
immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
• 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept during pregnancy in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  
Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  
Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  
Renal abnormalities. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Microphthalmia; 
Congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
Septum pellucidum agenesis; 
Olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions to 
mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, CellCept is contraindicated in nursing mothers (see section 
4.3). 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage 
following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil. 
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on animal 
data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is so low that 
it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in animal studies at 
concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins such that the risk of 
genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or their 
female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male patient and 
for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive potential 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential risks of 
fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
dose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study 
conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, agnathia, 
and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic 
exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
CellCept may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients are 
advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%) and vomiting (up to 
39.1%) were among the most common and/or serious adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of CellCept in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is evidence of a higher frequency 
of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency category 
for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 
to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000). Due 
to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions across the different 
transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and cardiac transplant 
patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, including 
CellCept, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin 
(see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac transplant patients did not reveal any 
unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients 
were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years.  
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal infections 
(some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic agents and latent 
viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see section 4.4). The most 
serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis and atypical 
mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 
3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in renal, cardiac and hepatic 
transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, CMV viraemia/syndrome 
and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK 
virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including 
CellCept. 
Blood and lymphatic disorders  
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
haemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking CellCept is advised (see section 4.4). There have been reports of aplastic 
anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with CellCept, some of which have been fatal. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with CellCept (see section 
4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with CellCept. These changes are not associated with impaired 
neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive CellCept. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and haemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, oesophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers often 
complicated by haemorrhage, as well as haematemesis, melena, and haemorrhagic forms of gastritis and 
colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common gastrointestinal 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorders, however, were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of patients with 
CellCept-related diarrhoea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported.  
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, mainly 
in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to CellCept 
in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated with 
CellCept in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been fatal. There have also 
been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving CellCept in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal oedema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of the 
medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients aged 
2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were generally similar 
to those observed in adult patients given 1 g CellCept twice daily. However, the following treatment-
related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric population, particularly in children under 6 
years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, leukopenia, anaemia and infection.  
Elderly  
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving CellCept as part of a combination immunosuppressive 
regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) 
and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared to younger individuals.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during post-
marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose cases in 
which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the medicinal 
product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of the 
immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see section 4.4). If 
neutropenia develops, dosing with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. Bile 
acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic recirculation 
of the drug (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents ATC code: L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage pathways, 
MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also influences 
cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It  has been shown, using 
human CD4+ T-cells,  that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a proliferative state 
to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic state of T-cells, whereby 
the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of acute 
rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of CellCept is correlated with 
MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate mofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 
94% relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of 
mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID to renal transplant patients. However, 
MPA Cmax was decreased by 40% in the presence of food. Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable 
systemically in plasma following oral administration.  
Distribution 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are usually 
observed at approximately 6 – 12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of approximately 40% 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating that there is a significant 
amount of enterohepatic recirculation.  
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97% bound to plasma albumin. 
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower compared to 
the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). 
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via enterohepatic 
recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is pharmacologically active 
and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF’s side effects (diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1% of the dose) in the urine. Oral administration 
of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the administered dose with 93% of 
the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in the faeces. Most (about 87%) of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. However, 
at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/ml), small amounts of MPAG are removed. By 
interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine, 
reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP isoforms, 
MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the glucuronides’ 
biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, but its 
contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its metabolites 
potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; only 
apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease approximate 
clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were observed. In 
transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean half-life values 
shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant patients. In the 
individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment with other 
immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal function. These 
factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when CellCept is co-administered with cyclosporine (see 
section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over time compared to what is observed 
immediately after transplantation. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 ml/min/1.73 m2) were 28 – 75% higher relative to 
the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal impairment. The 
mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3 – 6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment than in 
subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the known renal 
elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe chronic renal 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with 
severe chronic renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0-12h was comparable to that 
seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC 0-12h was 2 – 3-
fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a transient 
increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal graft 
function. Dose adjustment of CellCept does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively unaffected 
by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably depend on the 
particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary biliary cirrhosis, 
may show a different effect.  
Paediatric population  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 18 years) 
given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC values similar 
to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving CellCept at a dose of 1 g BID in the early and late 
post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were similar in the early and late post-
transplant period. 
Elderly   
The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered in 
the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of CellCept (1 g BID) and combined oral contraceptives containing 
ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or 
gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant women (not taking other 
immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no clinically relevant influence of 
CellCept on the ovulation-suppressing action of the oral contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and 
progesterone were not significantly affected. The pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not 
affected to a clinically relevant degree by co-administration of CellCept (see also section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2 – 3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) 
observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 1.3 – 2 times the 
systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose 
of 3 g/day. 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus 
test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. These effects can be 
related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide synthesis in sensitive cells. 
Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate genotoxic activity. 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at  
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at these 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure at 
the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose 
of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at systemic 
exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. Gastrointestinal 
and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the highest dose 
(systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical toxicity profile 
of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in human clinical trials, 
which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see section 4.8).

The educational materials shall contain the following key elements: 
Separate guides for healthcare professionals and patients should be provided. For patients, the text should 
be appropriately separated for men and women. The following areas should be covered in these guides:  
An introduction in each guide will inform the reader that the purpose of the guide is to tell them 
• 
that a foetal exposure must be avoided and how to minimise the risk of birth defects and miscarriage 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. It will explain that although this guide is very important it does 
not provide full information on mycophenolate mofetil and that the SmPC (healthcare professionals) and 
package leaflet (patients) supplied with the medicine must also be read carefully.  
Background information on mycophenolate mofetil teratogenicity and mutagenicity in humans. 
• 
This section will provide important background information concerning the teratogenicity and 
mutagenicity of mycophenolate mofetil. It will provide details about the nature and magnitude of the risk, 
in line with the information provided in the SmPC. The information provided in this section will facilitate 
a correct understanding of the risk and explain the rationale for the following pregnancy prevention 
measures. Guides should also mention that patients should not to give this drug to any other person.  
• 
Counselling of patients: This section will emphasise the importance of a thorough, informative 
and ongoing dialogue between patient and healthcare professional about the pregnancy risks associated 
with mycophenolate mofetil and the relevant minimisation strategies including alternative treatment 
choices, if applicable. The need to plan a pregnancy will be highlighted.  
The need to avoid foetal exposure: Contraceptive requirements for patients of reproductive 
• 
potential prior to, during and after treatment with mycophenolate mofetil. Contraceptive requirements for 
sexually active male patients (including vasectomised men) and female patients of childbearing potential 
will be explained. The need for contraception prior to, during and after treatment with mycophenolate 
mofetil, including details of the duration of time for which contraception must be continued after cessation 
of therapy, will be clearly stated.  
In addition, the text relating to women should explain the pregnancy test requirements prior to and during 
therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; including the advice for two negative pregnancy tests prior to 
starting therapy and the importance of the timing of these tests. The need for subsequent pregnancy tests 
during treatment will also be explained.  
Advice that patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following 
• 
discontinuation of mycophenolate. Furthermore, men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 
days following discontinuation of mycophenolate. 
85 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Advice on action if a pregnancy occurs or is suspected during or shortly after being treated with 
• 
mycophenolate mofetil. Patients will be informed that they should not stop taking mycophenolate mofetil 
but must contact their doctor immediately. It will be explained that the correct course of action, based on 
an assessment of the individual benefit-risk, will be determined on a case-by-case basis through a 
discussion between the treating physician and the patient. 
In addition, a pregnancy follow-up questionnaire including details of exposure during pregnancy, 
including timing and dose; duration of therapy, before and during pregnancy; concomitant drugs; known 
teratogenic risks and full details of congenital malformations should be agreed to with the national 
competent authorities.

1. 
What CellCept is and what it is used for 
This belongs to a group of medicines called “immunosuppressants”.  
CellCept contains mycophenolate mofetil.  
• 
CellCept is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ. 
• 
CellCept should be used together with other medicines: 
• 
Ciclosporin and corticosteroids. 
A kidney, heart or liver.  
2. 
What you need to know before you take CellCept 
WARNING 
Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you 
must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice 
given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before you 
take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and precautions” and 
“Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. 
Do not take CellCept: 
• 
If you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
• 
112 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking CellCept. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: 
• 
If you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events 
such as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when compared 
to younger patients 
If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat  
If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer 
If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking 
CellCept 
If you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller 
syndrome 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with CellCept. 
The effect of sunlight 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the 
amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. 
Other medicines and CellCept 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because CellCept can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way CellCept works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before you 
start CellCept: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant 
operation 
cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol 
rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) 
antacids or proton pump inhibitors – used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion 
phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate gets 
absorbed into their blood 
antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  
isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections 
telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. 
113 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. 
CellCept with food and drink 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. 
Before you start taking CellCept 
During your entire treatment with CellCept  
For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. 
Contraception in women taking CellCept 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception with 
CellCept. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not have been effective 
or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago (if 
your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance 
you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking CellCept 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or your female 
partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days after you stop 
taking CellCept.  
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks in 
case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 27%) 
in the unborn baby. Birth defects that have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of face (cleft 
114 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat with the 
stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not 
properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor may 
request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can pass 
into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines until 
you feel better. 
CellCept contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take CellCept 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
How much to take 
The amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown below. 
Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent rejection of your transplant organ. 
Kidney transplant 
Adults 
• 
• 
• 
Children (aged 2 to 18 years) 
• 
• 
The first dose is given within 3 days of the transplant operation. 
The daily dose is 8 capsules (2 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  
Take 4 capsules in the morning and then 4 capsules in the evening. 
The dose given will vary depending on the size of the child.  
Your doctor will decide the most appropriate dose based on your child’s height and weight (body 
surface area – measured as square metres or “m2”). The recommended dose is 600 mg/m² taken 
twice a day. 
Heart transplant 
Adults 
• 
• 
• 
Children

The first dose is given within 5 days of the transplant operation. 
The daily dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  
Take 6 capsules in the morning and then 6 capsules in the evening. 
There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a heart transplant. 
115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liver transplant 
Adults 
• 
• 
• 
Children 
• 
The first dose of oral CellCept will be given to you at least 4 days after the transplant operation and 
when you are able to swallow oral medicines. 
The daily dose is 12 capsules (3 g of the medicine) taken as 2 separate doses.  
Take 6 capsules in the morning and then 6 capsules in the evening.  
There is no information for the use of CellCept in children with a liver transplant. 
Taking the medicine 
Swallow your capsules whole with a glass of water 
• 
• 
Do not break or crush them 
Do not take any capsules that have broken open or split. 
Take care not to let any powder from inside a broken capsule get into your eyes or mouth. 
• 
If this happens, rinse with plenty of plain water. 
Take care not to let any powder from inside a broken capsule get onto your skin.  
If this happens, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water. 
• 
If you take more CellCept than you should 
If you take more CellCept than you should, talk to a doctor or go to a hospital straight away. Also do this 
if someone else accidentally takes your medicine. Take the medicine pack with you. 
If you forget to take CellCept 
If you forget to take your medicine at any time, take it as soon as you remember. Then continue to take it 
at the usual times. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. 
If you stop taking CellCept 
Do not stop taking CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may increase 
the chance of rejection of your transplant organ.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may need 
urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may 
be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). 
Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection and 
vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: 
• 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections 
Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. 
116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Fighting infections 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your 
body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections than 
usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary system.  
Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on CellCept have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  
General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic reactions 
(such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such as stomach, 
chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  
Other unwanted effects may include: 
Skin problems such as:  
• 
acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. 
Urinary problems such as:  
• 
blood in the urine. 
Digestive system and mouth problems such as:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, 
inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,  
gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, 
liver disorder,  
diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. 
Nervous system problems such as:  
• 
•

Making up the medicine 
1. 
What CellCept is and what it is used for 
This belongs to a group of medicines called “immunosuppressants”.  
CellCept contains mycophenolate mofetil.  
• 
CellCept is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ. 
• 
CellCept should be used together with other medicines: 
• 
Ciclosporin and corticosteroids. 
A kidney or liver.  
2. 
What you need to know before you take CellCept  
WARNING 
Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you 
must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice 
given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before you 
take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and precautions” and 
“Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. 
Do not take CellCept: 
• 
If you are allergic  to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, polysorbate 80 or any of the other 
ingredients in this medicine (listed in section 6) 
121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not have this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
nurse before having CellCept. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse straight away before starting treatment with CellCept: 
• 
If you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events such as 
certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when compared to younger 
patients 
If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer 
If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are taking 
CellCept. 
If you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse straight away before 
starting treatment with CellCept. 
The effect of sunlight 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the 
amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not administer this medicine to children because safety and efficacy of infusions to paediatric patients 
have not been established. 
Other medicines and CellCept  
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because CellCept can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way CellCept works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines before you start 
CellCept: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant 
operation 
cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol 
rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) 
phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate gets 
absorbed into their blood. 
antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  
isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections 
telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while having CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. 
122 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. 
Before you start taking CellCept 
During your entire treatment with CellCept  
For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. 
Contraception in women taking CellCept 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception with 
CellCept. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not have been effective 
or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago (if 
your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance 
you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            
salpingo-oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking CellCept 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution, you or your 
female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days after you 
stop taking CellCept.  
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks in 
case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or   suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23-27 %) 
in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of face 
(cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat with the 
123 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not 
properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor may 
request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can pass 
into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines until 
you feel better. 
CellCept contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take CellCept 
CellCept is usually given by a doctor or nurse in hospital. It is given as a slow drip (infusion) into a vein.  
How much to take 
The amount you take depends on the type of transplant you have had. The usual doses are shown below. 
Treatment will continue for as long as you need to prevent rejection of your transplant organ. 
Kidney transplant 
Adults 
• 
• 
• 
The first dose is given within 24 hours of the transplant operation. 
The daily dose is 2 g of the medicine taken as 2 separate doses.  
This will be given as 1 g in the morning and then 1 g in the evening. 
Liver transplant 
Adults 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The first dose is given to you as soon as possible after the transplant operation. 
You will have the medicine for at least 4 days. 
The daily dose is 2 g of the medicine taken as 2 separate doses.  
This will be given as 1 g in the morning and then 1 g in the evening. 
When you are able to swallow, you will be given this medicine by mouth. 
Making up the medicine 
The medicine comes as a powder. This needs mixing with glucose before using. Your doctor or nurse will 
make up the medicine and give it to you. They will follow the instructions under section 7 “Making up the 
medicine”. 
If you take more CellCept than you should 
If you think that you have had too much medicine, talk to your doctor or nurse straight away. 
124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take CellCept 
If a dose of CellCept is missed, this will be given to you as soon as possible. Your treatment will then 
continue at the normal times. 
If you stop taking CellCept 
Do not stop having CellCept unless your doctor tells you to. If you stop your treatment you may increase 
the chance of rejection of your transplant organ.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Talk to a doctor or nurse straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you 
may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may be 
having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). 
Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection and 
vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: 
• 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. 
Fighting infections 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your 
body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections than 
usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary system.  
Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients having this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on CellCept have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  
General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic reactions 
(such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such as stomach, 
chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  
Other unwanted effects may include: 
Skin problems such as:  
• 
acne, cold sores, skin growth, shingles, hair loss, rash, itching. 
Urinary problems such as:  
• 
blood in the urine. 
Digestive system and mouth problems such as:  
• 
• 
• 
•  
swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, 
inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach,  
gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, 
liver disorders,  
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. 
Nervous system problems such as:  
• 
• 
• 
feeling drowsy or numb,  
tremor, muscle spasms convulsions,  
feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. 
Heart and blood vessel problems such as: 
• 
• 
change in blood pressure, blood clots, accelerated heartbeat 
pain, redness and swelling of the blood vessels where you had the infusion. 
Lung problems such as:  
• 
• 
pneumonia, bronchitis,  
shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung 
airways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor if 
you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness  
fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, 
sinus problems. 
•  
• 
Other problems such as:  
• 
weight loss, gout, high blood sugar, bleeding, bruising.

Making up the medicine 
Method and route of administration 
CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion does not contain an antibacterial 
preservative; therefore, reconstitution and dilution of the product must be performed under aseptic 
conditions. 
The contents of CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion vials must be 
reconstituted with 14 ml of glucose intravenous infusion 5% each. A further dilution with glucose 
intravenous infusion 5% is required to a final concentration of 6 mg/ml. This means that to prepare a 1 g 
dose of mycophenolate mofetil the content of 2 reconstituted vials (approx. 2 x 15 mL) must be further 
diluted into 140 ml glucose intravenous infusion 5% solution. If the infusion solution is not prepared 
immediately prior to administration, the commencement of administration of the infusion solution should 
be within 3 hours from reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product. 
If this happens, rinse your eyes with plain water. 
Take care not to let the made-up medicine get into your eyes. 
∙ 
Take care not to let the made-up medicine get on your skin.  
∙ 
CellCept 500 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion must be given as an intravenous (IV) 
infusion. The infusion flow rate should be controlled to equate to a 2-hour period of administration.  
If this happens, wash the area thoroughly with soap and water.  
CellCept IV solution should never be administered by rapid or bolus intravenous injection.

given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of

If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before you 
take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and precautions” and 
“Pregnancy and breast-feeding”.

If you are breast-feeding. 
• 
•

pharmacist before taking CellCept. 
Warnings and precautions

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with CellCept. 
The effect of sunlight 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the 
amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. 
Other medicines and CellCept:  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because CellCept can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also, other medicines can affect the way CellCept works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before you 
start CellCept: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system - given after a transplant 
operation 
cholestyramine - used to treat high cholesterol 
rifampicin - an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) 
antacids or proton pump inhibitors - used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion 
phosphate binders - used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate gets 
absorbed into their blood. 
antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  
isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
first. Your doctor will have to advise you on which vaccines you can have. 
You must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. 
CellCept with food and drink 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. 
Before you start taking CellCept 
During your entire treatment with CellCept  
For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. 
Contraception in women taking CellCept 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception with 
CellCept. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not have been effective 
or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago (if 
your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance 
you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            
salpingo-oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking CellCept 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution, you or your 
female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days after you 
stop taking CellCept.  
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks in 
case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
131 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 27 %) 
in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of face 
(cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat with the 
stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not 
properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor may 
request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can pass 
into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines until 
you feel better.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may need 
urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing – you may be 
having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). 
134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection and 
vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: 
• 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. 
Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. 
Fighting infections 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your 
body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections than 
usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary system.  
Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on CellCept have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin.  
General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic reactions 
(such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such as stomach, 
chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.  
Other unwanted effects may include: 
Skin problems such as:  
• 
acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. 
Urinary problems such as: 
• 
blood in the urine. 
Digestive system and mouth problems such as: 
• 
• 
• 
•  
• 
swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers, 
inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach, 
gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding, 
liver disorders, 
diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. 
Nervous system problems such as: 
• 
• 
• 
feeling dizzy, drowsy or numb, 
tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions, 
feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. 
Heart and blood vessel problems such as: 
• 
change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, widening of blood vessels.  
Lung problems such as: 
• 
• 
pneumonia, bronchitis, 
shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung 
airways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor if 
you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness  
fluid on the lungs or inside the chest, 
sinus problems. 
• 
• 
135 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other problems such as:

If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking CellCept. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with CellCept:

to younger patients 
If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with CellCept. 
The effect of sunlight 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit the 
amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. 
Other medicines and CellCept 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes 
medicines obtained without a prescription, such as herbal medicines. This is because CellCept can affect 
the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect the way CellCept works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before you 
start CellCept: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system – given after a transplant 
operation 
cholestyramine – used to treat high cholesterol 
rifampicin – an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB) 
antacids or proton pump inhibitors – used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion 
phosphate binders – used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate gets 
absorbed into their blood. 
antibiotics – used to treat bacterial infections  
isavuconazole – used to treat fungal infections 
telmisartan – used to treat high blood pressure

•

• 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking CellCept, talk to your doctor or pharmacist 
first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. 
140 
 
 
 
 
 
You must not donate blood during treatment with CellCept and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with CellCept and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. 
CellCept with food and drink 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with CellCept. 
Before you start taking CellCept 
During your entire treatment with CellCept  
For 6 weeks after you stop taking CellCept. 
Contraception in women taking CellCept 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use an effective method of contraception with 
CellCept. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not have been effective 
or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year ago (if 
your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a chance 
you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral                            
salpingo-oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a specialist 
gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the XY 
genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking CellCept 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the father 
takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or your female 
partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days after you stop 
taking CellCept.  
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about the risks in 
case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking CellCept until you see him or her. 
141 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 27 %) 
in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of face 
(cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat with the 
stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not 
properly developed). Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor may 
request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take CellCept if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can pass 
into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
CellCept has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines until 
you feel better. 
CellCept contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, CellCept can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you may need 
urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may be 
having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). 
Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection and 
vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in: 
• 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. 
Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. 
Fighting infections 
CellCept reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, your 
body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more infections than 
usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and urinary system.  
143 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lymph and skin cancer

(such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such as stomach, 
chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.

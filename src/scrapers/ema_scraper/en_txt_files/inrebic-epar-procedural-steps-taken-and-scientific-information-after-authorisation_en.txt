to update drug-drug interaction information with dual 
The following information regarding Simultaneous inhibition 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, based on final 
results from study FEDR-CP-004; this is a phase 1, 
open-label study to evaluate the effect of a dual 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor, fluconazole, on the 
pharmacokinetics of fedratinib in healthy adult 
subjects. 
of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 was added: 
Co-administration of fluconazole (dual inhibitor of CYP3A4 
and CYP2C19, 200 mg once daily) with a single dose of 
fedratinib (100 mg) increased AUCinf of fedratinib by 1.7-
fold. 
Based on PBPK simulations, co-administration of

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

fluconazole (200 mg once daily) with fedratinib 400 mg 
once daily is predicted to increase fedratinib AUC at steady 
state by 1.5-fold. 
The existing warning on interactions was updated to include 
that: patients taking concomitant dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 
and CYP2C19 may require more intensive safety monitoring 
and if necessary, dose modifications of Inrebic based on 
adverse reactions.

Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC in order to add 
new warnings on major adverse cardiac events

(MACE), thrombosis and secondary malignancies. 
The updates pertain to three signals, which were 
identified with another JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) 
indicated in rheumatoid arthritis; the Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to 
the PI.

(another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 
years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular 
risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular 
events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, non fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke, was 
observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors.  
Events of MACE have been reported in patients receiving 
Inrebic. Prior to initiating or continuing therapy with 
Inrebic, the benefits and risks for the individual patient 
should be considered particularly in patients 65 years of 
age and older, patients who are current or past long time 
smokers, and patients with history of atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease or other cardiovascular risk factors. 
Thrombosis 
In a large randomised active-controlled study of tofacitinib 
(another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 
years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular 
risk factor, a dose dependent higher rate of venous 
thromboembolic events (VTE) including deep venous 
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) was 
observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
Events of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving 
Inrebic. Prior to initiating or continuing therapy with 
Inrebic, the benefits and risks for the individual patient 
should be considered particularly in patients with 
cardiovascular factors (see also section 4.4 “Major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE)”). 
Page 3/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with known VTE risk factors other than 
cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors, Inrebic should be 
used with caution. VTE risk factors other than 
cardiovascular or malignancy risk factors include previous 
VTE, patients undergoing major surgery, immobilisation, 
use of combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone 
replacement therapy, and inherited coagulation disorder.  
Patients should be re-evaluated periodically during Inrebic 
treatment to assess for changes in VTE risk.  
Promptly evaluate patients with signs and symptoms of VTE 
and discontinue Inrebic in patients with suspected VTE, 
regardless of dose. 
Secondary malignancies 
In a large randomised active controlled study of tofacitinib 
(another JAK inhibitor) in rheumatoid arthritis patients 50 
years and older with at least one additional cardiovascular 
risk factor, a higher rate of malignancies, particularly lung 
cancer, lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) 
was observed with tofacitinib compared to TNF inhibitors. 
Lymphoma and other malignancies have been reported in 
patients receiving JAK inhibitors, including Inrebic. Prior to 
initiating or continuing therapy with Inrebic, the benefits 
and risks for the individual patient should be considered 
particularly in patients 65 years of age and older and 
patients who are current or past long-time smokers.

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to update drug-drug interaction information 
regarding medicinal products renally excreted via 
organic cation transporter (OCT)2 and multidrug and 
toxin extrusion (MATE)1/2-K (e.g. metformin) based 
on data from study FEDR-CP-003 (drug transporter 
DDI Study) listed as recommendation during initial 
assessment. The Package Leaflet is updated

recently revised ATC code in section 5.1 of the

Co-administration of a single dose of fedratinib (600 mg) 
with a single dose of digoxin (P-gp substrate: 0.25 mg), 
rosuvastatin (OATP1B1/1B3 and BCRP substrate: 10 mg), 
and metformin (OCT2 and MATE1/2-K substrate: 1000 mg) 
had no clinically meaningful effect on the AUCinf of digoxin, 
rosuvastatin, and metformin. Renal clearance of metformin 
was decreased by 36% in the presence of fedratinib. The 
glucose-lowering pharmacodynamic effect of metformin in 
the presence of fedratinib appears reduced, with the 
glucose AUC0-3h being 17% higher. Caution should be 
exercised and dose modifications should be made as 
needed for agents that are renally excreted via OCT2 and 
MATE1/2-K.

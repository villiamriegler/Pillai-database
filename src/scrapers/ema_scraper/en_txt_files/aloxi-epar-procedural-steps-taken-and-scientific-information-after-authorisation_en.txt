Given the well-established and favourable safety profile of 
Aloxi, and to be consistent with current medical practice for 
patient self-medication to prevent CINV, and further 
recognizing that the SmPCs for other oral 5-HT3 licensed 
for prevention of CINV allow patient self-medication, the 
requirement that Aloxi capsules are to be administered by 
healthcare professionals can be omitted.

SmPC and PL 
The update of SPC sections 4.4 and 5.1 was mainly based 
additional information pertinent to the warning on 
QT/QTc prolongation mainly based on results of 
clinical study. In addition, the PL section 2 has been 
amended with information regarding personal of 
family history of QT prolongation. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
on a phase 1, randomised, single dose, double-blind, 
double dummy, parallel group, placebo-controlled and 
active comparator study demonstrating that there were no 
dose-related ECG effects of single doses of palonosetron 
from 0.25 to 2.25 mg covering a 9-fold range of exposure 
(where the lower limit is the current recommended dose of 
palonosetron for single day chemotherapy). Out of 221 
subjects, 42 were with placebo, 44 with palonosetron 0.25 
mg IV, 46 with palonosetron 0.75 mg IV, 46 with 
palonosetron 2.25 mg IV and 43 with moxifloxacin 400 mg 
oral.

interval for all time points for all 3 doses of palonosetron

showed values all <10 msec and hence confirmed no effect 
of palonosetron on cardiac repolarisation in this study. The 
mean changes observed in Heart Rate, PR and QRS 
duration, as well as QTc duration using all three correction 
formulae were not found to be of any clinical significance. 
No outliers were found for Heart Rate, PR and QRS 
duration. No late affects were noted to occur. No changes 
in ECG wave form morphology were identified. 
In addition, analyses to determine the PK/PD relationship 
between plasma concentrations of palonosetron after 
intravenous administration and ECG QT and corrected QT 
intervals found no statistical or experimental evidence to 
demonstrate any potential relationship for corrected QT 
interval or QT intervals and plasma palonosetron 
concentrations after single dose administration of 
intravenous palonosetron.  
The package leafet has been amended in order to 
completely reflect the existing SPC warning for 5HT3 
antagonists to exercise caution when used concomitantly 
with medicinal products that increase the QT interval or in 
patients with a personal or family history of QT 
prolongation.

Update of SPC section 4.2 to remove the information

introduced to several languages. 
0.25mg to healthy volunteers and the second study 
examining alternate daily doses in male patients receiving 
chemotherapy. Furthermore, a PK simulation (using a two-
compartment body model) was performed to produce a 
plasma concentration time profile for IV palonosetron 0.25 
mg given by a 10- second bolus infusion daily for three

days. 
The simulation indicated that AUC(0-INFINITY) for repeated 
daily dosing of IV palonosetron 0.25 mg over three days 
was similar to that observed for a single 0.75 mg IV dose, 
and that the Cmax for each of the three 0.25 mg repeated 
daily doses was lower than that of a single 0.75 mg dose. 
With simulation of continued daily dosing of IV 
palonosetron 0.25 mg to steady state (eight days), the 
predicted steady state Cmax was lower than the Cmax 
value after a single 0.75 mg dose based on observed data 
from study 2092. 
Therefore it can be concluded that with repeated dosing, 
accumulation of palonosetron in plasma was predictable 
based on its long plasma elimination half-life of 
approximately 40 hours and at steady state Cmax was 
lower than the Cmax value after a single 0.75 mg dose 
based on observed data from study 2092. 
The CHMP considered that the experienced gained form 
these studies are deemed sufficient to allow removal of the 
statement from section 4.2 of the SPC. However, to 
emphasize that Aloxi is not indicated for the prevention or 
treatment of delayed nausea and vomiting caused by 
moderate or highly emetogenic therapy further clarifying 
statements have been added to SPC section 4.2 and 4.4.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Adults 
Saxenda is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adult patients with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of:  
• 
• 
≥30 kg/m² (obesity), or 
≥27 kg/m² to <30 kg/m² (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbidity 
such as dysglycaemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus), hypertension, dyslipidaemia or 
obstructive sleep apnoea. 
Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose if patients 
have not lost at least 5% of their initial body weight. 
Adolescents (≥12 years) 
Saxenda can be used as an adjunct to a healthy nutrition and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adolescent patients from the age of 12 years and above with: 
• 
• 
obesity (BMI corresponding to ≥30 kg/m2 for adults by international cut-off points)* and 
body weight above 60 kg.  
Treatment with Saxenda should be discontinued and re-evaluated if patients have not lost at least 4% 
of their BMI or BMI z score after 12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose.

4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
Adults  
The starting dose is 0.6 mg once daily. The dose should be increased to 3.0 mg once daily in 
increments of 0.6 mg with at least one-week intervals to improve gastro-intestinal tolerability (see 
table 2). If escalation to the next dose step is not tolerated for two consecutive weeks, consider 
discontinuing treatment. Daily doses higher than 3.0 mg are not recommended.

For adolescents from the age of 12 to below 18 years old a similar dose escalation schedule as for 
adults should be applied (see table 2). The dose should be increased until 3.0 mg (maintenance dose) 
or maximum tolerated dose has been reached. Daily doses higher than 3.0 mg are not recommended.  
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed within 12 hours from when it is usually taken, the patient should take the dose as 
soon as possible. If there is less than 12 hours to the next dose, the patient should not take the missed 
dose and resume the once-daily regimen with the next scheduled dose. An extra dose or increase in 
dose should not be taken to make up for the missed dose.  
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus  
Saxenda should not be used in combination with another GLP-1 receptor agonist.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When initiating Saxenda, it should be considered to reduce the dose of concomitantly administered 
insulin or insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Blood 
glucose self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of insulin or insulin-secretagogues (see section 
4.4). 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥65 years old) 
No dose adjustment is required based on age. Therapeutic experience in patients ≥75 years of age is 
limited and use in these patients is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance ≥30 ml/min). Saxenda is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) including patients with end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.2).  
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Saxenda 
is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used cautiously 
in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
No dose adjustment is required for adolescents from the age of 12 years and above.  
The safety and efficacy of Saxenda in children below 12 years of age has not been established (see 
section 5.1). 
Method of administration 
Saxenda is for subcutaneous use only. It must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
Saxenda is administered once daily at any time, independent of meals. It should be injected in the 
abdomen, thigh or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment. 
However, it is preferable that Saxenda is injected around the same time of the day, when the most 
convenient time of the day has been chosen. 
For further instructions on administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to liraglutide or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Patients with heart failure 
There is no clinical experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class IV, and liraglutide is therefore not recommended for use in these patients. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
The safety and efficacy of liraglutide for weight management have not been established in patients: 
– 
– 
– 
aged 75 years or more, 
treated with other products for weight management, 
with obesity secondary to endocrinological or eating disorders or to treatment with medicinal 
products that may cause weight gain, 
with severe renal impairment, 
with severe hepatic impairment. 
– 
– 
Use in these patients is not recommended (see section 4.2). 
As liraglutide for weight management was not investigated in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment, it should be used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
There is limited experience in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and diabetic gastroparesis. 
Use of liraglutide is not recommended in these patients since it is associated with transient 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 
Pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients should be 
informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide 
should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide should not be restarted.  
Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis 
In clinical trials for weight management, a higher rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis was observed 
in patients treated with liraglutide than in patients on placebo. The fact that substantial weight loss can 
increase the risk of cholelithiasis and thereby cholecystitis only partially explained the higher rate with 
liraglutide. Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis may lead to hospitalisation and cholecystectomy. Patients 
should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. 
Thyroid disease 
In clinical trials in type 2 diabetes, thyroid adverse events, such as goitre, have been reported in 
particular in patients with pre-existing thyroid disease. Liraglutide should therefore be used with 
caution in patients with thyroid disease. 
Heart rate 
An increase in heart rate was observed with liraglutide in clinical trials (see section 5.1). Heart rate 
should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Patients should be 
informed of the symptoms of increased heart rate (palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while 
at rest). For patients who experience a clinically relevant sustained increase in resting heart rate, 
treatment with liraglutide should be discontinued. 
Dehydration 
Signs and symptoms of dehydration, including renal impairment and acute renal failure, have been 
reported in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Patients treated with liraglutide should be 
advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take 
precautions to avoid fluid depletion. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving liraglutide in combination with insulin and/or 
sulfonylurea may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia may be 
lowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin and/or sulfonylurea. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Episodes of clinically significant hypoglycaemia have been reported in adolescents (≥12 years) treated 
with liraglutide. Patients should be informed about the characteristic symptoms of hypoglycaemia and 
the appropriate actions.  
Hyperglycaemia in insulin treated patients with diabetes mellitus  
In patients with diabetes mellitus Saxenda must not be used as a substitute for insulin. Diabetic 
ketoacidosis has been reported in insulin-dependent patients after rapid discontinuation or dose 
reduction of insulin (see section 4.2). 
Excipients 
Saxenda contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, therefore the medicinal product is 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
In vitro, liraglutide has shown very low potential to be involved in pharmacokinetic interactions with 
other active substances related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding. 
The small delay of gastric emptying with liraglutide may influence absorption of concomitantly 
administered oral medicinal products. Interaction studies did not show any clinically relevant delay of 
absorption and therefore no dose adjustment is required. 
Interaction studies have been performed with 1.8 mg liraglutide. The effect on rate of gastric emptying 
was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3.0 mg, (paracetamol AUC0-300 min). Few patients 
treated with liraglutide reported at least one episode of severe diarrhoea. Diarrhoea may affect the 
absorption of concomitant oral medicinal products.  
Warfarin and other coumarin derivatives 
No interaction study has been performed. A clinically relevant interaction with active substances with 
poor solubility or narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin cannot be excluded. Upon initiation of 
liraglutide treatment in patients on warfarin or other coumarin derivatives, more frequent monitoring 
of International Normalised Ratio (INR) is recommended. 
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) 
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of paracetamol following a single dose of 1,000 mg. 
Paracetamol Cmax was decreased by 31% and median tmax was delayed up to 15 min. No dose 
adjustment for concomitant use of paracetamol is required. 
Atorvastatin 
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of atorvastatin following single dose administration of 
atorvastatin 40 mg. Therefore, no dose adjustment of atorvastatin is required when given with 
liraglutide. Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with 
liraglutide. 
Griseofulvin 
Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure of griseofulvin following administration of a single 
dose of griseofulvin 500 mg. Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median tmax did not change. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose adjustments of griseofulvin and other compounds with low solubility and high permeability are 
not required. 
Digoxin  
A single dose administration of digoxin 1 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC 
by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%. Digoxin median tmax was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. No dose 
adjustment of digoxin is required based on these results.  
Lisinopril  
A single dose administration of lisinopril 20 mg with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril 
AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%. Lisinopril median tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with 
liraglutide. No dose adjustment of lisinopril is required based on these results. 
Oral contraceptives 
Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively, following 
administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive product. tmax was delayed by 1.5 h with 
liraglutide for both compounds. There was no clinically relevant effect on the overall exposure of 
either ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect is therefore anticipated to be 
unaffected when co-administered with liraglutide. 
Paediatric population  
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of liraglutide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Liraglutide should not be used during pregnancy. If a patient wishes to become pregnant or pregnancy 
occurs, treatment with liraglutide should be discontinued. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether liraglutide is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that the 
transfer of liraglutide and metabolites of close structural relationship into milk is low. Non-clinical 
studies have shown a treatment-related reduction of neonatal growth in suckling rat pups (see section 
5.3). Because of lack of experience, Saxenda should not be used during breast-feeding.  
Fertility 
Apart from a slight decrease in the number of live implants, animal studies did not indicate harmful 
effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Saxenda has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness 
can be experienced mainly during the first 3 months of treatment with Saxenda. Driving or use of 
machines should be exercised with caution if dizziness occurs.

4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile:  
Saxenda was evaluated for safety in 5 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that enrolled 5,813 adult 
patients with overweight or obesity  with at least one weight-related comorbidity. Overall, 
gastrointestinal reactions were the most frequently reported adverse reactions during treatment 
(67.9%) (see section ‘Description of selected adverse reactions’). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

****From controlled phase 2, 3a and 3b clinical trials. 
Description of selected adverse reactions:  
Hypoglycaemia in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus 
In clinical trials in overweight or obese patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Saxenda 
in combination with diet and exercise, no severe hypoglycaemic events (requiring third party 
assistance) were reported. Symptoms of hypoglycaemic events were reported by 1.6 % of patients 
treated with Saxenda and 1.1% of patients treated with placebo; however, these events were not 
confirmed by blood glucose measurements. The majority of events were mild. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
In a clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with Saxenda in 
combination with diet and exercise, severe hypoglycaemia (requiring third party assistance) was 
reported by 0.7% of patients treated with Saxenda and only in patients concomitantly treated with 
sulfonylurea. Also, in these patients documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia was reported by 43.6% 
of patients treated with Saxenda and in 27.3% of patients treated with placebo. Among patients not 
concomitantly treated with sulfonylurea, 15.7% of patients treated with Saxenda and 7.6% of patients 
treated with placebo reported documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events (defined as plasma 
glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L accompanied by symptoms).  
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin 
In a clinical trial in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and 
liraglutide 3.0 mg/day in combination with diet and exercise and up to 2 OADs, severe hypoglycaemia 
(requiring third party assistance) was reported by 1.5% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day. 
In this trial, documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (defined as plasma glucose ≤3.9 mmol/L 
accompanied by symptoms) was reported by 47.2% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and 
by 51.8% of patients treated with placebo. Among patients concomitantly treated with sulfonylurea, 
60.9% of patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg/day and 60.0% of patients treated with placebo 
reported documented symptomatic hypoglycaemic events.  
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Most episodes of gastrointestinal events were mild to moderate, transient and the majority did not lead 
to discontinuation of therapy. The reactions usually occurred during the first weeks of treatment and 
diminished within a few days or weeks on continued treatment. 
Patients ≥65 years of age may experience more gastrointestinal effects when treated with Saxenda.  
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min) may experience 
more gastrointestinal effects when treated with Saxenda. 
Acute renal failure 
In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been reports of acute renal failure. A 
majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting or 
diarrhoea leading to volume depletion (see section 4.4). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions 
Few cases of anaphylactic reactions with symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, dyspnoea and 
oedema have been reported with marketed use of liraglutide. Anaphylactic reactions may potentially 
be life threatening. If an anaphylactic reaction is suspected, liraglutide should be discontinued and 
treatment should not be restarted (see section 4.3). 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions have been reported in patients treated with Saxenda. These reactions were 
usually mild and transitory and the majority disappeared during continued treatment. 
Tachycardia 
In clinical trials, tachycardia was reported in 0.6% of patients treated with Saxenda and in 0.1% of 
patients treated with placebo. The majority of events were mild or moderate. Events were isolated and 
the majority resolved during continued treatment with Saxenda. 
Paediatric population 
In a clinical trial conducted in adolescents of 12 years to less than 18 years with obesity, 125 patients 
were exposed to Saxenda for 56 weeks.  
Overall, the frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in the adolescents with obesity were 
comparable to that observed in the adult population. Vomiting occurred with a 2-fold higher frequency 
in adolescents compared to adults.  
The percentage of patients reporting at least one episode of clinically significant hypoglycaemia was 
higher with liraglutide (1.6%) compared to placebo (0.8%). No severe hypoglycaemic episodes 
occurred in the trial.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
From clinical trials and post-marketing use of liraglutide overdoses have been reported up to 72 mg 
(24 times the recommended dose for weight management). Events reported included severe nausea, 
severe vomiting and severe hypoglycaemia. 
In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the 
patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. The patient should be observed for clinical signs of dehydration 
and blood glucose should be monitored.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues.  
ATC code: A10BJ02  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Liraglutide is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue with 97% amino acid 
sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1. Liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 
receptor (GLP-1R). 
GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake, but the exact mechanism of action is 
not entirely clear. In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide led to uptake in specific 
brain regions involved in regulation of appetite, where liraglutide, via specific activation of the GLP-
1R, increased key satiety and decreased key hunger signals, thereby leading to lower body weight. 
GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in specific locations in the heart, vasculature, immune system and 
kidneys. In mouse models of atherosclerosis, liraglutide prevented aortic plaque progression and 
reduced inflammation in the plaque. In addition, liraglutide had a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. 
Liraglutide did not reduce the plaque size of already established plaques. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Liraglutide lowers body weight in humans mainly through loss of fat mass with relative reductions in 
visceral fat being greater than for subcutaneous fat loss. Liraglutide regulates appetite by increasing 
feelings of fullness and satiety, while lowering feelings of hunger and prospective food consumption, 
thereby leading to reduced food intake. Liraglutide does not increase energy expenditure compared to 
placebo. 
Liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and lowers glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner 
which results in a lowering of fasting and post-prandial glucose. The glucose-lowering effect is more 
pronounced in patients with prediabetes and diabetes compared to patients with normoglycaemia. 
Clinical trials suggest that liraglutide improves and sustains beta-cell function, according to HOMA-B 
and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of liraglutide for weight management in conjunction with reduced calorie 
intake and increased physical activity were studied in four phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials which included a total of 5,358 adult patients.  
• 
• 
• 
Trial 1 (SCALE Obesity & Pre-Diabetes - 1839): A total of 3,731 patients with obesity (BMI 
≥30 kg/m²) or with overweight (BMI ≥27 kg/m²) with dyslipidaemia and/or hypertension were 
stratified according to prediabetes status at screening and BMI at baseline (≥30 kg/m² or 
<30 kg/m²). All 3,731 patients were randomised to 56 weeks of treatment and the 2,254 patients 
with prediabetes at screening were randomised to 160 weeks of treatment. Both treatment 
periods were followed by a 12-week off drug/placebo observational follow-up period. Lifestyle 
intervention in the form of an energy-restricted diet and exercise counselling was background 
therapy for all patients. 
The 56-week part of trial 1 assessed body weight loss in all the 3,731 randomised patients 
(2,590 completers).  
The 160-week part of trial 1 assessed time to onset of type 2 diabetes in the 2,254 randomised 
patients with prediabetes (1,128 completers). 
Trial 2 (SCALE Diabetes - 1922): A 56-week trial assessing body weight loss in 846 
randomised (628 completers) obese and overweight patients with insufficiently controlled type 
2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c range 7–10%). The background treatment at trial start was either diet 
and exercise alone, metformin, a sulfonylurea, a glitazone as single agents or any combination 
hereof. 
Trial 3 (SCALE Sleep Apnoea - 3970): A 32-week trial assessing sleep apnoea severity and 
body weight loss in 359 randomised (276 completers) obese patients with moderate or severe 
obstructive sleep apnoea. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Trial 4 (SCALE Maintenance - 1923): A 56-week trial assessing body weight maintenance 
and weight loss in 422 randomised (305 completers) obese and overweight patients with 
hypertension or dyslipidaemia after a preceding weight loss of ≥5% induced by a low-calorie 
diet. 
Body weight 
Superior weight loss was achieved with liraglutide compared to placebo in obese/overweight patients 
in all groups studied. Across the trial populations, greater proportions of the patients achieved ≥5% 
and >10% weight loss with liraglutide than with placebo (tables 4–6). In the 160-weeks part of trial 1, 
the weight loss occurred mainly in the first year and was sustained throughout 160 weeks. In trial 4, 
more patients maintained the weight loss achieved prior to treatment initiation with liraglutide than 
with placebo (81.4% and 48.9%, respectively). Specific data on weight loss, responders, time course 
and cumulative distribution of weight change (%) for trials 1–4 are presented in tables 4–8 and figures 
1, 2 and 3.  
Weight loss response after 12 weeks with liraglutide (3.0 mg) treatment 
Early responders were defined as patients who achieved ≥5% weight loss after 12 weeks on treatment 
dose of liraglutide (4 weeks of dose escalation and 12 weeks on treatment dose). In the 56-week part 
of trial 1, 67.5% achieved ≥5% weight loss after 12 weeks. In trial 2, 50.4% achieved ≥5% weight loss 
after 12 weeks. With continued treatment with liraglutide, 86.2% of these early responders are 
predicted to achieve a weight loss of ≥5% and 51% are predicted to achieve a weight loss of ≥10% 
after 1 year of treatment. The predicted mean weight loss in early responders who complete 1 year of 
treatment is 11.2% of their baseline body weight (9.7% for males and 11.6% for females). For patients 
who have achieved a weight loss of <5% after 12 weeks on treatment dose of liraglutide, the 
proportion of patients not reaching a weight loss of ≥10% after 1 year is 93.4%. 
Glycaemic control 
Treatment with liraglutide significantly improved glycaemic parameters across sub-populations with 
normoglycaemia, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the 56-week part of trial 1, fewer 
patients treated with liraglutide had developed type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to patients treated 
with placebo (0.2% vs. 1.1%). More patients with prediabetes at baseline had reversed their 
prediabetes compared to patients treated with placebo (69.2% vs. 32.7%). In the 160-week part of trial 
1, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
evaluated as time to onset. At week 160, while on treatment, 3% treated with Saxenda and 11% treated 
with placebo were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The estimated time to onset of type 2 
diabetes mellitus for patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg was 2.7 times longer (with a 95% 
confidence interval of [1.9, 3.9]), and the hazard ratio for risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus 
was 0.2 for liraglutide versus placebo. 
Cardiometabolic risk factors 
Treatment with liraglutide significantly improved systolic blood pressure and waist circumference 
compared with placebo (tables 4, 5 and 6). 
Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) 
Treatment with liraglutide significantly reduced the severity of obstructive sleep apnoea as assessed by 
change from baseline in the AHI compared with placebo (table 7).

Figure 3 Change from randomisation (week 0) in body weight (%) by time in trial 4 
Before week 0 patients were only treated with low-calorie diet and exercise. At week 0 patients were 
randomised to receive either Saxenda or placebo. 
Immunogenicity 
Consistent with the potentially immunogenic properties of protein and peptide pharmaceuticals, 
patients may develop anti-liraglutide antibodies following treatment with liraglutide. In clinical trials, 
2.5% of patients treated with liraglutide developed anti-liraglutide antibodies. Antibody formation has 
not been associated with reduced efficacy of liraglutide. 
Cardiovascular evaluation 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were adjudicated by an external independent group of 
experts and defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death. In all 
the long-term clinical trials with Saxenda, there were 6 MACE for patients treated with liraglutide and 
10 MACE for placebo-treated patients. The hazard ratio and 95% CI is 0.33 [0.12; 0.90] for liraglutide 
versus placebo. A mean increase in heart rate from baseline of 2.5 beats per minute (ranging across 
trials from 1.6 to 3.6 beats per minute) has been observed with liraglutide in clinical phase 3 trials. The 
heart rate peaked after approximately 6 weeks. The long-term clinical impact of this mean increase in 
heart rate has not been established. The change in heart rate was reversible upon discontinuation of 
liraglutide (see section 4.4). 
The Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes Results 
(LEADER) trial included 9,340 patients with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes. The vast 
majority of these had established cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to either 
liraglutide on a daily dose of up to 1.8 mg (4,668) or placebo (4,672), both on a background of 
standard of care. 
The duration of exposure was between 3.5 and 5 years. The mean age was 64 years and the mean BMI 
was 32.5 kg/m². Mean baseline HbA1c was 8.7 and had improved after 3 years by 1.2 % in patients 
assigned to liraglutide and by 0.8 % in patients assigned to placebo. The primary endpoint was the 
time from randomisation to first occurrence of any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. 
Liraglutide significantly reduced the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (primary endpoint 
events, MACE) vs. placebo (3.41 vs. 3.90 per 100 patient years of observation in the liraglutide and 
placebo groups, respectively) with a risk reduction of 13%, HR 0.87, [0.78, 0.97] [95% CI]) (p=0.005)

Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Saxenda in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of obesity (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).  
In a double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of Saxenda versus placebo on weight loss in 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and above with obesity, Saxenda was superior to placebo in weight 
reduction (evaluated as BMI Standard Deviation Score) after 56 weeks of treatment (table 9). 
A greater proportion of the patients achieved ≥5% and ≥10% reductions in BMI with liraglutide than 
with placebo, as well as greater reductions in mean BMI and body weight (table 9). After 26 weeks of 
off-trial product follow-up period, weight regain was observed with liraglutide vs placebo (table 9).

1.8 mg, 4 patients (3.2%) escalated and remained on dose of 1.2 mg and 3 patients (2.4%) remained on 
dose of 0.6 mg. 
No effects on growth or pubertal development were found after 56 weeks of treatment. 
A 16-week double-blind, 36 week open-label study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of Saxenda in paediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome and obesity. The study included 32 
patients between 12 to <18 years of age (part A) and 24 patients between 6 to <12 years of age (part 
B). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive Saxenda or placebo. Patients with a body weight less than 
45 kg started dose escalation at a lower dose; 0.3 mg instead of 0.6 mg and were escalated to a 
maximum dose of 2.4 mg. 
The estimated treatment difference in mean BMI SDS at 16 weeks (part A: -0.20 vs -0.13, part B: -
0.50 vs -0.44) and 52 weeks (part A: -0.31 vs -0.17, part B: -0.73 vs -0.67) were similar with Saxenda 
and placebo.   
No additional safety concerns were seen in the trial. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
The absorption of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration was slow, reaching maximum 
concentration approximately 11 hours post dosing. The average liraglutide steady state concentration 
(AUCτ/24) reached approximately 31 nmol/L in obese (BMI 30–40 kg/m2) patients following 
administration of 3 mg liraglutide. Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally with dose. Absolute 
bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration is 20–25 L (for a person 
weighing approximately 100 kg). Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>98%).  
Biotransformation 
During 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the 
major component in plasma was intact liraglutide. Two minor plasma metabolites were detected (≤9% 
and ≤5% of total plasma radioactivity exposure). 
Elimination 
Liraglutide is endogenously metabolised in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ 
as major route of elimination. Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in 
urine or faeces. Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related 
metabolites in urine or faeces (6% and 5%, respectively). The urine and faeces radioactivity was 
mainly excreted during the first 6–8 days and corresponded to three minor metabolites, respectively.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The mean clearance following subcutaneous administration of liraglutide is approximately 0.9–1.4 L/h 
with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
Age had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results from a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of data from overweight and obese patients (18 to 82 years). No 
dosage adjustment is required based on age. 
Gender 
Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analysis, females have 24% lower weight adjusted 
clearance of liraglutide compared to males. Based on the exposure response data, no dose adjustment 
is necessary based on gender. 
Ethnic origin 
Ethnic origin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the 
results of population pharmacokinetic analysis which included overweight and obese patients of 
White, Black, Asian and Hispanic/non-Hispanic groups.  
Body weight 
The exposure of liraglutide decreases with an increase in baseline body weight. The 3.0 mg daily dose 
of liraglutide provided adequate systemic exposures over the body weight range of 60–234 kg 
evaluated for exposure response in the clinical trials. Liraglutide exposure was not studied in patients 
with body weight >234 kg. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of liraglutide was evaluated in patients with varying degree of hepatic 
impairment in a single-dose trial (0.75 mg). Liraglutide exposure was decreased by 13–23% in patients 
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects. Exposure was significantly 
lower (44%) in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score >9). 
Renal impairment 
Liraglutide exposure was reduced in patients with renal impairment compared to individuals with 
normal renal function in a single-dose trial (0.75 mg). Liraglutide exposure was lowered by 33%, 14%, 
27% and 26%, respectively, in patients with mild (creatinine clearance, CrCl 50–80 ml/min), moderate 
(CrCl 30–50 ml/min) and severe (CrCl <30 ml/min) renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease 
requiring dialysis. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic properties for liraglutide 3.0 mg were assessed in clinical studies for adolescent 
patients with obesity aged 12 to less than 18 years (134 patients, body weight 62-178 kg). The 
liraglutide exposure in adolescents (age 12 to less than 18 years) was similar to that in adults with 
obesity.  
Pharmacokinetic properties were also assessed in a clinical pharmacology study in the paediatric 
population with obesity aged 7-11 years (13 patients, body weight 54-87 kg) respectively.  
Exposure associated with 3.0 mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between the children aged 7 
to 11, adolescents and adults with obesity, after correction for body weight.

5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity. 
Non-lethal thyroid C-cell tumours were seen in two-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice. In 
rats, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not observed. These tumours were not seen in 
monkeys treated for 20 months. These findings in rodents are caused by a non-genotoxic, specific 
GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. The relevance for 
humans is likely to be low but cannot be completely excluded. No other treatment-related tumours 
have been found. 
Animal studies did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility but slightly increased 
early embryonic deaths at the highest dose. Dosing with liraglutide during mid-gestation caused a 
reduction in maternal weight and foetal growth with equivocal effects on ribs in rats and skeletal 
variation in the rabbit. Neonatal growth was reduced in rats while exposed to liraglutide and persisted 
in the post-weaning period in the high dose group. It is unknown whether the reduced pup growth is 
caused by reduced pup milk intake due to a direct GLP-1 effect or reduced maternal milk production 
due to decreased caloric intake. 
In juvenile rats, liraglutide caused delayed sexual maturation in both males and females at clinical 
relevant exposures. These delays had no impact upon fertility and reproductive capacity of either sex, 
or on the ability of the females to maintain pregnancy.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Saxenda is and what it is used for 
What Saxenda is 
Saxenda is a weight loss medicine that contains the active substance liraglutide. It is similar to a 
natural occurring hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that is released from the intestine 
after a meal. Saxenda works by acting on receptors in the brain that control your appetite, causing you 
to feel fuller and less hungry. This may help you eat less food and reduce your body weight. 
What Saxenda is used for 
Saxenda is used for weight loss in addition to diet and exercise in adults aged 18 and above who have  
• 
• 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or 
a BMI of 27 kg/m² and less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems 
(such as diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in the blood or breathing 
problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’). 
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
You should only continue using Saxenda if you have lost at least 5% of your initial body weight after 
12 weeks on the 3.0 mg/day dose (see section 3). Consult your doctor before you continue. 
Saxenda can be used as an adjunct to a healthy nutrition and increased physical activity for weight 
management in adolescents from the age of 12 years and above who have: 
• 
• 
obesity (diagnosed by your doctor) 
body weight above 60 kg 
You should only continue using Saxenda if you have lost at least 4% of your BMI after 12 weeks on 
the 3.0 mg/day dose or maximum tolerated dose (see section 3). Consult your doctor before you 
continue. 
Diet and exercise 
Your doctor will start you on a diet and exercise programme. Stay on this programme while you are 
using Saxenda. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use Saxenda  
Do not use Saxenda  
– 
if you are allergic to liraglutide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Saxenda. 
The use of Saxenda is not recommended if you have severe heart failure.  
There is little experience with this medicine in patients of 75 years and older. It is not recommended if 
you are 75 years or older. 
There is little experience with this medicine in patients with kidney problems. If you have kidney 
disease or are on dialysis, consult your doctor.  
There is little experience with this medicine in patients with liver problems. If you have liver 
problems, consult your doctor. 
This medicine is not recommended if you have a severe stomach or gut problem which results in 
delayed stomach emptying (called gastroparesis), or if you have an inflammatory bowel disease. 
People with diabetes  
If you have diabetes, do not use Saxenda as a replacement for insulin. 
Inflammation of the pancreas 
Talk to your doctor if you have or have had a disease of the pancreas.  
Inflamed gall bladder and gallstones 
If you lose substantial weight, you are at a risk of gallstones and thereby inflamed gall bladder. Stop 
taking Saxenda and contact a doctor immediately if you experience severe pain in your upper 
abdomen, usually worst on the right side under the ribs. The pain may be felt through to your back or 
right shoulder. See section 4. 
Thyroid disease 
If you have thyroid disease, including thyroid nodules and enlargement of the thyroid gland, consult 
your doctor. 
Heart rate 
Talk to your doctor if you have palpitations (you feel aware of your heartbeat) or if you have feelings 
of a racing heartbeat while at rest during Saxenda treatment.  
Loss of fluid and dehydration 
When starting treatment with Saxenda, you may lose body fluid or become dehydrated. This may be 
due to feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and diarrhoea. It is important to avoid dehydration 
by drinking plenty of fluids. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions or 
concerns. See section 4. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of Saxenda in children below 12 years of age has not been studied.  
Other medicines and Saxenda 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if:  
• 
you are taking medicines for diabetes called ‘sulfonylurea’ (such as glimepiride or 
glibenclamide) or if you are taking insulin – you may get low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) 
when you use these medicines with Saxenda. Your doctor may adjust the dose of your diabetes 
medicine to prevent you from getting low blood sugar. See section 4 for the warning signs of 
low blood sugar. If you adjust your insulin dose your doctor may recommend you to monitor 
your blood sugar more frequently. 
you are taking warfarin or other medicines by mouth that reduce your blood clotting 
(anticoagulants). More frequent blood testing to determine the ability of your blood to clot may 
be required. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Do not use Saxenda if you are pregnant, think that you might be pregnant or are planning to have a 
baby. This is because it is not known if Saxenda may affect the baby. 
Do not breast-feed if you are using Saxenda. This is because it is not known if Saxenda passes into 
breast milk.  
Driving and using machines  
Saxenda is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines.  
Some patients may feel dizziness when taking Saxenda mainly during the first 3 months of treatment 
(see section ‘Possible side effects’). If you feel dizziness be extra careful while driving or using 
machines. If you need any further information, talk to your doctor.  
Important information about some of the ingredients of Saxenda 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that it is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

1 Prepare your pen with a new needle 
  A 
• 
• 
Check the name and coloured label of your pen, to make sure that it 
contains Saxenda. This is especially important if you take more than one 
type of injectable medicine. Using the wrong medicine could be harmful 
to your health. 
Pull off the pen cap. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Check that the solution in your pen is clear and colourless. Look 
through the pen window. If the solution looks cloudy, do not use the pen. 
  B 
• 
Take a new needle and tear off the paper tab. 
Make sure to attach the needle correctly. 
Push the needle straight onto the pen. 
Turn until it is on tight. 
  C 
  D 
The needle is covered by two caps. You must remove both caps. If 
you forget to remove both caps, you will not inject any solution. 
  E 
Pull off the outer needle cap and keep it for later. You will need it after 
the injection, to safely remove the needle from the pen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pull off the inner needle cap and throw it away. If you try to put it 
back on, you may accidentally stick yourself with the needle. 
A drop of solution may appear at the needle tip. This is normal, but you 
must still check the flow if you use a new pen for the first time. 
Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your 
injection. 
Always use a new needle for each injection. 
This may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection and 
inaccurate dosing. 
Never use a bent or damaged needle. 
2 Check the flow with each new pen  
• 
• 
If your pen is already in use, go to step 3 ‘Select your dose’. Only check 
the flow before your first injection with each new pen. 
Turn the dose selector to the flow check symbol (
Make sure the flow check symbol lines up with the pointer. 
) right past 0.

• 
Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. 
Press and hold in the dose button until the dose counter returns to 0. 
The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. 
A drop of solution should appear at the needle tip. 
  B 
A small drop may remain at the needle tip, but it will not be injected. 
If no drop appears, repeat step 2 ‘Check the flow with each new pen’ up 
to 6 times. If there is still no drop, change the needle and repeat step 
2 ‘Check the flow with each new pen’ once more. 
If a drop still does not appear, dispose of the pen and use a new one. 
Always make sure that a drop appears at the needle tip before you use 
a new pen for the first time. This makes sure that the solution flows.  
If no drop appears, you will not inject any medicine, even though the 
dose counter may move. This may indicate a blocked or damaged 
needle.  
If you do not check the flow before your first injection with each new 
pen, you may not get the prescribed dose and the intended effect of 
Saxenda. 
3 Select your dose 
  A 
• 
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter shows your dose 
(0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3.0 mg).  
If you select the wrong dose, you can turn the dose selector forward or 
backwards to the correct dose.  
The pen can dial up to a maximum of 3.0 mg. 
The dose selector changes the dose. Only the dose counter and dose 
pointer will show how many mg you select per dose. 
You can select up to 3.0 mg per dose. When your pen contains less than 
3.0 mg the dose counter stops before 3.0 is shown. 
The dose selector clicks differently when turned forward, backwards or 
past the number of mg left. Do not count the pen clicks. 
Always use the dose counter and the dose pointer to see how many 
mg you have selected before injecting this medicine.  
Do not count the pen clicks. 
Do not use the pen scale. It only shows approximately how much solution 
is left in your pen. 
Only doses of 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg or 3.0 mg must be 
selected with the dose selector. The selected dose must line up precisely 
with the dose pointer to ensure that you get a correct dose. 
How much solution is left? 
• 
The pen scale shows you approximately how much solution is left in 
your pen.

• 
To see precisely how much solution is left, use the dose counter:  
Turn the dose selector until the dose counter stops. 
If it shows 3.0, at least 3.0 mg are left in your pen. If the dose counter 
stops before 3.0 mg, there is not enough solution left for a full dose of 
3.0 mg. 
  B 
If you need more medicine than what is left in your pen 
Only if trained or advised by your doctor or nurse, you may split your dose 
between your current pen and a new pen. Use a calculator to plan the doses as 
instructed by your doctor or nurse. 
Example 
Dose counter 
stopped: 
2.4 mg left 
Be very careful to calculate correctly. 
If you are not sure how to split your dose using two pens, then select and 
inject the dose you need with a new pen. 
4 Inject your dose 
  A 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Insert the needle into your skin as your doctor or nurse has shown you. 
Make sure you can see the dose counter. Do not cover it with your 
fingers. This could interrupt the injection. 
Press and hold down the dose button. Watch as the dose counter  
returns to 0. The 0 must line up with the dose pointer. You may then 
hear or feel a click. 
Continue pressing the dose button while keeping the needle in your       
skin. 
  B 
Count slowly to 6 while keeping the dose button pressed. 
If the needle is removed earlier, you may see a stream of solution coming 
from the needle tip. If so, the full dose will not be delivered. 
  C  Count slowly: 
1-2-3-4-5-6 
• 
Remove the needle from your skin. You can then release the dose 
button. 
  D 
If blood appears at the injection site, press lightly.  
You may see a drop of solution at the needle tip after injecting. This is 
normal and does not affect your dose. 
Always watch the dose counter to know how many mg you inject. 
Hold the dose button down until the dose counter shows 0. 
How to identify a blocked or damaged needle? 
• 
If 0 does not appear in the dose counter after continuously pressing 
the dose button, you may have used a blocked or damaged needle. 
In this case – you have not received any medicine – even though the 
dose counter has moved from the original dose that you have set.

How to handle a blocked needle? 
Change the needle as described in step 5 ‘After your injection’ and repeat 
all steps starting with step 1 ‘Prepare your pen with a new needle’. Make 
sure you select the full dose you need. 
Never touch the dose counter when you inject. This can interrupt the 
injection. 
5 After your injection 
Always dispose of the needle after each injection to ensure convenient 
injection and prevent blocked needles. If the needle is blocked, you will 
not inject any medicine. 
Lead the needle tip into the outer needle cap on a flat surface without 
touching the needle or the outer needle cap. 
Once the needle is covered, carefully push the outer needle cap 
completely on.  
Unscrew the needle and dispose of it carefully, as instructed by your 
doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. 
  A 
  B 
Put the pen cap on your pen after each use to protect the solution from 
light. 
  C 
When the pen is empty, throw it away without a needle on as instructed 
by your doctor, nurse, pharmacist or local authorities. 
Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may 
stick yourself with the needle. 
Always remove the needle from your pen after each injection. 
This may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection, leakage of 
solution and inaccurate dosing. 
Further important information 
Always keep your pen and needles out of sight and reach of others, 
especially children.  
Never share your pen or your needles with other people.  
Caregivers must be very careful when handling used needles - to 
prevent needle injury and cross-infection. 
Caring for your pen 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Do not leave the pen in a car or other place where it can get too hot or 
too cold.  
Do not inject Saxenda which has been frozen. If you do that, you may 
not get the intended effect of this medicine.  
Do not expose your pen to dust, dirt or liquid.  
Do not wash, soak or lubricate your pen. It may be cleaned with a 
mild detergent on a moistened cloth. 
Do not drop your pen or knock it against hard surfaces. If you drop it or 
suspect a problem, attach a new needle and check the flow before you 
inject. 
Do not try to refill your pen. Once empty, it must be disposed of.  
Do not try to repair your pen or pull it apart.

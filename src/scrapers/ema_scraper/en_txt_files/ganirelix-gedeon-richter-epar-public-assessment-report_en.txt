2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled syringe MAA has been 
submitted according to the Article 10.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (i.e. generic application) 
containing the same active substance in the same pharmaceutical form and strength as the reference 
product. The reference product is Orgalutran solution for injection 0.25mg/0.5mL, marketed by N.V. 
Organon, that was first approved in the European Union on 17/05/2000 via centralised procedure 
(EU/1/00/130/001-002). 
Ganirelix is an anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormone which blocks the receptors for the natural 
hormone gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and therefore prevents premature ovulation.
The indication applied for Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is the same as that for the reference product.
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is indicated for the prevention of premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges 
in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproduction techniques 
(ART).
In clinical studies ganirelix was used with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or 
corifollitropin alfa, the sustained follicle stimulant.
2.2.  Quality aspects
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing ganirelix acetate (hydrate) 
equivalent to 0.25 mg of ganirelix in 0.5 mL aqueous solution. 
Other ingredients are: glacial acetic acid, mannitol (E 421), water for injections, sodium hydroxide (for 
pH adjustment)
The product is available in a pre-filled glass syringe with staked stainless steel needle, closed with a 
plunger stopper and supplied with a plunger rod. The injection needle is provided with a rigid needle 
shield, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance
General information
The chemical name of ganirelix acetate is N-acetyl-3-(2-napthyl)-D-alanyl-4-chloro-D-phenylalanyl-3-
(3-pyridyl)-D-alanyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-N9 ,N10-diethyl-D-homoarginyl-L-leucyl-N9,N10-diethyl-L-
homoarginyl- L-prolyl-D-alanylamide acetate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C80H113ClN18O13·xC2H4O2 y H2O (2<x<3, y≤10), with the number of acetates being between 2 and 3. It 
is supplied in the hydrated form, with less than 10 molecules of water per molecule of active 
substance. The acetic acid-free anhydrous active substance has a relative molecular mass of 1570.42.
Assessment report 
EMA/588110/2022 
Page 9/20
Figure 1: active substance structure
The chemical structure and solid state properties of ganirelix was elucidated by a combination of tests:  
amino acids analysis UV, IR, RP-HPLC, MS, NMR, XRD, CD and elemental analysis. 
An appropriate comparison to the reference product, Orgalutran, for primary, secondary and tertiary 
structure has been provided. 
Ganirelix is a white or off-white powder and loose lumps substance. It is amorphous and highly soluble 
under aqueous physiological pH. Additionally, polymorphism is not relevant as the active substance is 
present in solution in the finished product.
Ganirelix exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 10 chiral centres, associated with chiral 
centres of individual amino acids. Chirality is ensured at the level of the starting materials (i.e. 
modified amino-acids) and controlled at the level of the active substance specifications by specific 
optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for ganirelix. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
One active substance manufacturer (ASM) is proposed. Detailed information on the manufacturing of 
the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered 
satisfactory. During the procedure starting materials, solvents and reagents have been included in the 
description of the manufacturing method in the applicant’s part of the ASMF.
Ganirelix is synthesized using commercially available well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered 
adequate. 
The reagents and solvents used in the manufacture are typical reagents and solvents (class 2 and 3) 
with suitable controls in place for each. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities 
are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual 
impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.
Assessment report 
EMA/588110/2022 
Page 10/20
Limits are set according to ICH Q3A. Three reagents have been identified as potential 
mutagens/genotoxic impurities due to their reactivity. All three impurities are easily purged. This is 
also confirmed by batch data. All peptide related substances are controlled as specified or unspecified 
impurities to well below the strictest TTC.
The manufacturing process development has been adequately described in the restricted part of the 
ASMF. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered 
to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.
The active substance is packaged in a triple layer bag (2 LDPE, 1 composite)which is placed in a 
container, to protect the active substance from light. The LDPE contact material complies with the EC 
10/2011 as amended.
Specification
The active substance specification includes tests for; appearance (in house-organoleptic), specific 
optical rotation (in-house), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (in-house), identification (HPLC, 
amino acid analysis), purity ( in house), bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.) 
and assay (in-house).
The specification is set based on ICH Q3A, Q3C, Q6A, and Ph.Eur. /USP pharmacopoeial tests were 
relevant methods or tests are available.
Detailed impurity profile has been provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches and 3 validation batches) of the active substance are 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.
Stability
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial packagefor up to 36 months under long term conditions (5°C) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (25°C and 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. 36 months data at- 20°C was also provided for the same batches. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (in-house), purity (in-
house) and assay (in-house).
The results obtained for the batches stored both at -20°C and 5°C are comparable: no major trends 
are observed.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch and provided during 
the procedure. The results demonstrate that ganirelix acetate is sensitive under light and that the 
proposed packaging is adequate to protect the active substance from light. 
Results on stress conditions (acid, alkali, oxidation, high temperature, high humidity and light) were 
also provide on samples of the active substance as part of the validation of related substances and 
assay tests. As expected, the active substance is most sensitive towards hydrolysis and oxidation; a 
minor degree of degradation is also observed at high heat and under light/UV. The mass is acceptable; 
the tests are stability indicating.
Assessment report 
EMA/588110/2022 
Page 11/20
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when stored at 
2-8°C when stored in the original container in order to protect from light. Keep the container tightly 
closed in order to protect from moisture.
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development
The finished product Ganirelix is a clear and colourless solution for injection, filled in a glass syringe 
with staked stainless steel needle, closed with a plunger stopper and supplied with a plunger rod. The 
injection needle is provided with a rigid needle shield.
The glass syringe with stacked needle is considered an integral device, which is intended exclusively 
for use in the given combination and not reusable, hence, no CE mark is required. The applicant 
claimed compliance with the MDR and in response to a Major Objection raised during the procedure a 
satisfactory Notified Body Opinion, confirming full compliance with the relevant GSPRs, was provided.
Each syringe contains 0.5 mL of solution. The applied product is qualitatively the same as the reference 
product has the same active substance strength and volume as the reference product. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to formulate a sterile solution for injection containing 
ganirelix as active substance that shows essential similarity to the reference product, Orgalutran 0.25 
mg/0.5 mL solution for injection (Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited) containing Ganirelix.
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements.
The quality target product profile (QTPP) is summarised in Table 1 below.

The formulation and manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. The 
development section focuses on addressing identified potential high or medium risk parameters or 
attributes, and understanding the impact the process could have on those. 
The manufacturing process is simple and has the following steps: compounding, sterile filtration and 
terminal sterilisation; no major manufacturing development took place as terminal sterilisation was 
possible. Compatibility with the manufacturing equipment has been supported by several studies 
Assessment report 
EMA/588110/2022 
Page 12/20
 
including an extractables study of the filling assembly used for processing. Adequate critical process 
parameters and IPCs have been identified.
Eventually, all identified potential risks were downgraded to low, by appropriately controlling 
compounding variables.
The essential similarity of Ganirelix 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled syringe by 
Gedeon Richter with the reference product Orgalutran 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection (Merck 
Sharp and Dohme B.V.) has been justified by performing the following comparisons: compositions, 
physical characterization (appearance, clarity of liquid, colour of liquid, pH, osmolality, particulate 
contamination), identity of active substance and chemical comparison of products (active substance, 
related substances and ganirelix agglomeration). The quantitative composition of the USA reference 
product is known and has been matched by the applicant. Mannitol is the main excipient in solution, in 
view of the equivalent osmolality value/range, which is a critical quality attribute, it can be further 
concluded that the test and reference products have the same quantitative composition of mannitol. 
The pH is also identical to one of the innovator product. Based on this no bioequivalence study was 
performed, as discussed under Section 3.3.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.
The primary packaging is a colourless borosilicate glass syringe (type I), with stainless steel hypodermic 
G29 needle and rigid needle shield; the plunger stopper is bromobutyl elastomer plunger stopper coated 
with silicone.
Both the syringes and plunger stoppers are purchased sterile, ready-to-use (RTU). The material complies 
with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. Satisfactory extractable and leachables studies have been provided. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.
Hold time has been included in the validation and considered acceptable. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.
Product specification 
The finished product release and end of shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: characters (visual, in-house), clarity of liquid (Ph.Eur.), colour of liquid (Ph.Eur), 
extractable volume (Ph.Eur), pH (Ph.Eur), osmolality (Ph.Eur), particulate contamination (visible and 
sub-visible particles (Ph.Eur), identification (UHPLC and UV-diode array), related substances (UHPLC), 
assay (UHPLC), sterility (Ph.Eur.) and bacterial endotoxin (Ph.Eur.).
The parameters tested, methods and acceptance criteria given in the finished product specifications 
have been established considering pharmacopoeial and ICH requirements and are supported by batch 
results and stability data.
Assessment report 
EMA/588110/2022 
Page 13/20
The acceptance criteria for related substances have been revised during the procedure in response to a 
MO raised by CHMP and are in line with ICH Q3B (R2) or based on the results found for the reference 
product.
At release the specification has been set in accordance with the Directive 75/318/EEC and EMA 3AQ11a 
guideline. For the shelf-life specification, the wider specification range has been set which allows for 
assay method variability and takes into consideration a limited batch history with the finished product 
manufacturing.
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed 
necessary.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored upright and inverted 
position for up to 24 months under long term conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to six months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for the finished product specification parameters. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating. 
A slight increase in total impurities is observed at accelerated conditions but results still remain within 
the proposed specification. No significant changes have been observed at long term and accelerated 
stability studies for the remaining test parameters. All parameters remained within the proposed 
specifications.
As part of the validation of related substance test, samples of the finished product were exposed to 
stress conditions: pH sensitivity (acid, alkaline), oxygen sensitivity, photostability (ICH Q1B) and heat 
sensitivity. The finished product is sensitive to all stress conditions and especially to acid, alkaline, and

heat. During the oxidative and photostability test some degradation products were generated in 
amount higher than QL.
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Based on the results of the photostability studies the finished 
product is not light sensitive. However, taking into consideration the stress testing results and that the 
storage condition of reference product, Orgalutran injection, requires that it is protected from light, the 
light protection is prescribed for the storage of Ganirelix 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-
filled syringe. This is accepted.
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and “Store in the original package 
in order to protect from light. Do not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are 
acceptable.
Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.2.4.  Post-approval change management protocols
Two PACMPs are submitted for this procedure. Both PACMPs are considered acceptable.
2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. A satisfactory NBOP for the integral device has been provided 
in response to a MO raised during the procedure. Another MO raised in relation to the specification 
limits for impurities has also been resolved by revising the concerned limits as requested. The results 
of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform 
performance in clinical use.
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.7.  Recommendations for future quality development  
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and is considered acceptable. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter manufactured by Chemical Works of Gedeon Richter Plc. 
(Gedeon Richter Plc.) is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales 
volumes for all ganirelix containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is 
adequate.
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The CHMP considers there are no objections to approval of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter from a non-clinical 
point of view.
2.4.  Clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
This is an application for solution for injection containing ganirelix. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the clinical pharmacology as well as efficacy and 
safety of ganirelix based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the reference 
product.
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product. 
For the clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance.
Exemption
According to Appendix II to the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1), there is no requirement for a bioequivalence study for solutions for

subcutaneous administration in case the generic formulation contains the same active substance in the 
same concentration as the reference product and the same excipients in similar amounts as the 
reference product. 
According to the applicant, the generic version developed by Chemical Works Of Gedeon Richter PLC 
has the same qualitative and quantitative composition as the European Reference Product (in terms of 
both active substance and excipients), thus the efficacy and safety of the product should be assumed 
to be the same as that of Orgalutran, which has been demonstrated by its continuous clinical use for 
more than 20 years. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Ganirelix Gedeon Richter (generic product) 
and Orgalutran (reference product) are sufficiently similar.
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
No bioequivalence study was submitted by the applicant as part of this application. 
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter, 0.25 mg/0.5 mL, is a solution for injection in pre-filled syringe for 
subcutaneous use. The reference product Orgalutran 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for injection in pre-filled 
syringe, marketed by N.V. Organon, was first approved in the European Union on 17/05/2000 via 
centralised procedure (EU/1/00/130/001-002).
The application concerns a generic application, based on article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
claiming essential similarity with the innovator product Orgalutran 0.25 mg/0.5 mL solution for 
injection. 
According to Appendix II to the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1), there is no requirement for a bioequivalence study for solutions for 
subcutaneous administration in case the generic formulation contains the same active substance in the 
same concentration as the reference product and the same excipients in similar amounts as the 
reference product.
Both products, the applied generic product Ganirelix Gedeon Richter and the reference product 
Orgalutran, contain 0.25 mg of the same active substance (ganirelix acetate). In addition, both 
products contain the same excipients (acetic acid and mannitol).
The essential similarity of the products has been justified by performing the following comparisons:
- Compositions of the solutions for injections
- Physical characterization of the reference product and Gedeon Richter’s product (appearance, clarity
of liquid, colour of liquid, pH, osmolality, particulate contamination)
- Chemical attributes of the solutions for injections (assay, related substances and ganirelix 
agglomeration)
Therefore, the Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is considered essentially similar to Orgalutran.
The lack of an in vivo bioequivalence study is considered acceptable.
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.

No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application; this is in accordance with the 
Appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1).
Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is considered essentially similar to Orgalutran (reference product).
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects
Based on the data provided, Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is considered bioequivalent with Orgalutran. 
The CHMP considers that there are no objections to approval of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter from a clinical 
point of view.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of ganirelix solution for injection. The reference product 
Orgalutran is indicated for the prevention of premature luteinising hormone (LH) surges in women 
undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproduction techniques (ART). In 
clinical studies ganirelix was used with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or 
corifollitropin alfa, the sustained follicle stimulant.
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance has been presented and is considered 
sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; 
the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature 
is considered sufficient.
No bioequivalence study between Ganirelix Gedeon Richter and the reference medicinal product 
Orgalutran was submitted to support the application; this is in accordance with the Appendix II to the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). 
The CHMP considers that the relevant criteria are met for Ganirelix Gedeon Richter to support the 
above exemption.
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Ganirelix Gedeon Richter is favourable in the following indication:

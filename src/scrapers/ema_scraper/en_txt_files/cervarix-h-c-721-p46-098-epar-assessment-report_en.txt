Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary 
• 
To assess the safety of Cervarix in terms of medically attended adverse event following 
immunisation (AEFIs) occurring within 30 days (Day 1-30) following each immunisation, in all 
enrolled subjects.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/620385/2021  
Page 3/22 
 
 
 
 
Secondary 
• 
To assess the safety of Cervarix in terms of serious AEFIs occurring during the period starting 
at the first immunisation and ending either 12 months following the third immunisation or 24 
months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (whichever occurred first), in all enrolled 
subjects. 
• 
To assess the safety of Cervarix in terms of pIMDs (potential immune-mediated disease) 
detected during the period starting at the first immunisation and ending either 12 months 
following the third immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix 
(whichever occurred first), in all enrolled subjects. 
• 
To assess the safety of Cervarix in terms of PO when administered inadvertently within 60 days 
before pregnancy onset or any time during pregnancy. 
• 
To assess the safety of Cervarix in terms of congenital anomalies when administered 
inadvertently within 60 days before pregnancy onset or any time during pregnancy. 
Study design 
• 
• 
Type of design: A prospective, descriptive, self-contained, multi-centre cohort study. 
This was a Targeted Safety Study (TSS) and a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS). 
•  Study population: The study planned to involve approximately 3000 female Chinese subjects 
aged between 9 and 45 years, vaccinated voluntarily as per standard practice. 
•  Data collection: electronic Case Report form (eCRF) was used to collect data. 
•  Study duration: The follow-up was to be performed from enrolment until either 12 months 
following the third immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix 
(whichever occurred first). This represented an individual subject’s total follow-up time 
between 18 and 24 months for subjects completing the immunisation course (3 doses) as per 
Cervarix PI schedule. Subjects who reported exposure to Cervarix during pregnancy or 
pregnancy onset up to 60 days following the last immunisation were to be followed-up till the 
end of pregnancy, to observe the PO and for any possible congenital anomalies diagnosed 
during the first 12 months of the child’s life. Thus, in such cases, an extended follow-up 
beyond 24 months may have occurred. 
•  Epoch 001: Prospective data collection starting at Visit 1 (Day 1) and ending at Call 3 (either 
12 months following the third immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation, 
whichever occurred first). 
Study population /Sample size 
The study involved female Chinese subjects aged between 9 and 45 years, vaccinated voluntarily as 
per standard practice. The planned sample size of the study was approximately 3000 subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary 
•  Occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination, of medically attended AEFIs 
reported during the 30-day period (Day 1-30) following each immunisation with Cervarix.

•  Occurrence, intensity and causal relationship to vaccination of serious AEFI reported during the 
period starting at the first immunisation and ending either 12 months following the third 
immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (whichever occurred 
first), in all enrolled subjects. 
•  Occurrence, intensity and causal relationship of pIMDs detected during the period starting at 
the first immunisation and ending either 12 months following the third immunisation or 24 
months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (whichever occurred first), in all enrolled 
subjects. 
•  Occurrence of PO when Cervarix was administered inadvertently within 60 days before 
pregnancy onset or any time during pregnancy. 
•  Occurrence of any congenital anomalies when Cervarix was administered inadvertently within 
60 days before pregnancy onset or any time during pregnancy. 
Statistical Methods 
Data sources: 
This prospective study collected data using active and enhanced passive surveillance methods: 
•  Subject interview and observation at immunisation visits (events that have occurred since the 
previous visits or that occurred during or just after the visit). 
•  Structured telephone follow-up. 
•  Direct reporting by the subjects/subjects parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) 
(LAR[s]). 
•  Reporting by physician not part of this study: A physician could report a suspected AEFI by 
contacting the study investigator or his/her delegate.

Safety results 
•  A total of 8839 doses of Cervarix were administered to 3013 subjects by the end of the study 
and were included in the analysis. Of these 3013 subjects, 147 subjects (4.9%) reported 
medically attended AEFIs within 30 days of vaccination, after 160 doses (1.8%). The medically 
attended AEFIs were mainly “Infections and infestations” (118 events in 96 subjects [3.2%] 
after 104 doses [1.2%]). The most frequently reported medically attended AEFIs were upper 
respiratory tract infection (32 events, reported by 30 subjects [1.0%]), bronchitis (27 events, 
reported by 25 subjects [0.8%]) and tonsillitis (12 events reported by 12 subjects [0.4%]). 
•  During the 30-day follow-up period after vaccination, a total of 55 medically attended AEFIs 
were reported by 49 subjects (1.6%) post dose 1. The most frequently reported medically

attended AEFI post dose 1 was upper respiratory tract infection (9 events, reported by 9 
subjects [0.3%]). A total of 71 medically attended AEFIs were reported by 55 subjects (1.8%) 
post dose 2. The most frequently reported medically attended AEFI post dose 2 was bronchitis 
(14 events, reported by 13 subjects [0.4%]). A total of 85 medically attended AEFIs were 
reported by 56 subjects (1.9%) post dose 3. The most frequently reported medically attended 
AEFI post dose 3 was upper respiratory tract infection (13 events, reported by 13 subjects 
[0.4%]) 
•  During the 30-day follow-up period after vaccination, a total of 3 medically attended AEFIs of 
grade 3 intensity was reported by 1 subject. The medically attended grade 3 AEFIs were 
pyrexia, bronchitis and rhinitis allergic. None of them were considered by the investigator to be 
causally related to vaccination. 
•  Among the medically attended AEFIs reported within 30 days following vaccination, 195 
medically attended AEFIs reported by 143 subjects (4.7%) were non-serious. Of these, 2 cases 
of pyrexia were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination (reported by 2 
subjects [0.1%], after 2nd dose). 
•  A total of 40 serious AEFIs were reported by 22 subjects (0.7%), after 22 doses (0.2%). The 
most frequently reported serious AEFIs were pneumonia (4 events, reported by 4 subjects 
[0.1%]) and ectopic pregnancy (4 events, reported by 4 subjects [0.1%]). None of these 
serious AEFIs were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination and most were 
of moderate (50%) or mild (37.5%) severity. Two events (5.0%) were severe. All serious 
AEFIs were recovered/resolved (95%) or recovering/resolving (5%) at the end of study.  
•  By the end of the follow-up period, 1 subject reported a pIMD (neuritis, (mild, grade 1) that 
was considered by the investigator not to be causally related to the vaccination, and the 
subject had recovered following treatment. 
• 
Furthermore, 65 subjects reported pregnancies during the entire follow-up period. Of these, 34 
subjects (52.3%) had a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly, 20 subjects (30.8%) 
had an elective termination with no apparent congenital anomaly, 4 subjects (6.2%) had an 
ectopic pregnancy, 1 subject (1.5%) had a live infant with congenital anomaly, and 1 subject 
(1.5%) had a spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly. Five subjects (7.7%) 
were lost to follow-up.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
• A total of 8839 doses of Cervarix were administered to 3013 subjects by the end of the study and 
were included in the analysis. Of these 3013 subjects, 147 subjects (4.9%) reported medically 
attended AEFIs within 30 days of vaccination, after 160 doses (1.8%). The medically attended AEFIs 
were mainly “Infections and infestations” (118 events in 96 subjects [3.2%] after 104 doses [1.2%]). 
• Among the medically attended AEFIs reported within 30 days following vaccination, 195 medically 
attended AEFIs reported by 143 subjects [4.7%] were non-serious. Of these, 2 cases of pyrexia were 
considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination (reported by 2 subjects [0.1%], after 2nd 
dose). 
• A total of 40 serious AEFIs were reported by 22 subjects (0.7%). None of these serious AEFIs were 
considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination and most were of moderate (50%) or mild 
(37.5%) severity. All serious AEFIs were recovered/resolved (95%) or recovering/resolving (5%) at 
the end of study. 
• By the end of the follow-up period, 1 subject reported a pIMD (neuritis) that was considered by the 
investigator not to be causally related to the vaccination, and the subject had recovered following 
treatment.

• Furthermore, 65 subjects out of 3031 subjects reported pregnancies during the entire follow-up 
period. Of these, 34 subjects (52.3%) had a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly, 20 
subjects (30.8%) had an elective termination with no apparent congenital anomaly, 4 subjects (6.2%) 
had an ectopic pregnancy, 1 subject (1.5%) had a live infant with congenital anomaly, and 1 subject 
(1.5%) had a spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly. Five subjects (7.7%) were 
lost to follow-up. 
No worrying signals were detected in this prospective, multi-centre post marketing surveillance (PMS) 
cohort study to monitor the safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ Human papillomavirus (HPV)-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine in female Chinese subjects aged between 9 and 45 years, when 
administered according to the Prescribing Information (PI) as per routine practice. 
The most reported adverse events are in the system organ class “Infections and infestations”. 
The MAH has reviewed the safety results of study EPI-HPV-070 VS CN PMS and has concluded that 
they are in line with the approved product information for Cervarix in the EU. In general, this is 
agreed. 
However, tree cases of « pelvic inflammatory disease » (medically attended AEFI ) were observed out 
of 3013 subjects vaccinated with HPV (within 30 days of vaccination). In general, it is agreed, as 
proposed by the MAH, that Pelvic Inflammatory disease is a consequence of infectious pathology and 
that it is not clear by which mechanism a vaccine could be the cause of PID. Although this possibility 
cannot totally be excluded, the observed number of cases is not worrisome. Since there was no control 
arm in the EPI-HPV-070 study, it is not possible to make a direct comparison, so the Company has 
provided some data from 2 previous large efficacy studies HPV-008 and HPV-039 conducted in similar 
age groups (15-25 and 18-25 years). Based on these, it can be concluded that the observed number of 
cases is within the expected rate (0.1%-0.3%). 
Overall, the number of reported pregnancies was too low to draw definitive conclusions, and, as stated 
in the SmPC, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Cervarix during 
pregnancy. 
Therefore, no additional changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix are 
considered necessary for the time being. 
The benefit/risk of Cervarix in the approved indications remains positive.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No worrying signals were detected in this prospective, multi-centre post marketing surveillance (PMS) 
cohort study to monitor the safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ Human papillomavirus (HPV)-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine in female Chinese subjects aged between 9 and 45 years, when 
administered according to the Prescribing Information (PI) as per routine practice. 
Therefore, no additional changes to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for Cervarix are 
considered necessary for the time being. 
The benefit/risk of Cervarix in the approved indications remains positive.

Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide an answer to the question below as part of this 
procedure. (see section “Additional clarification requested”) 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following question as part of this procedure: 
• 
Three cases of « pelvic inflammatory disease » (medically attended AEFI) were observed out of 
3013 subjects vaccinated with HPV (within 30 days of vaccination). This incidence should be 
discussed in the light of the observation made during previous clinical studies. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
The  EPI-HPV-070  study  was  a  prospective,  multi-centre  post  marketing  surveillance  (PMS)  cohort 
study to monitor the safety of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ Human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 
L1  VLP  AS04  vaccine  (Cervarix)  in  female  Chinese  subjects  aged  between  9  and  45  years,  when 
administered  according  to  the  Prescribing  Information  (PI)  as  per  routine  practice.  The  primary 
objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  safety  of  Cervarix  in  terms  of  medically  attended  adverse 
events  following  immunisation  (AEFIs)  occurring  within  30  days  (Day  1-30)  following  each 
immunisation, in all enrolled subjects. 
During this study three cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) were reported: 
 Case  no.  1  (serious): A 23-year-old female experienced progressive pain in the lower abdomen; 
had  fever  for  3  days;  and  developed  PID  sixteen  days  after  receiving  the  first  dose  of  Cervarix.  She 
was  hospitalised  for  6  days,  her  human  chorionic  gonadotropin  result  was  less  than  2.39  mIU/mL, 
white  blood  cell  count  was  12×109/L.  Ultrasound  scan  showed  fluid  at  the  back  of  uterus.  Physical 
examination  showed  that  abdomen  was  soft,  there  was  tenderness  in  lower  abdomen,  no  rebound 
pain, liver, and spleen less that the costal. The examination also showed vulva, vagina (unobstructed), 
cervix smooth with lifting pain, uterus was tender, there was untouched abnormality and tenderness in 
the  adnexa.  She  was  treated  with  traditional  Chinese  medicine  nos  (Jin  Ying  Jiao  Nang  and  Kang  Fu 
Yan Jiao Nang), cefixime, ornidazole, and ceftriaxone sodium. The subject got recovered from PID. In 
the opinion of the investigator, the event was considered not related to the administration of Cervarix. 
  Case  no.  2  (non-serious):  A  32-year-old  female  experienced  mild  PID  twenty-two  days  after 
receiving the first dose of Cervarix. The subject got recovered from PID and the event was considered 
by the investigator not related to Cervarix. 
 Case no. 3 (non-serious): A 35-year-old female experienced mild PID eleven days after receiving 
the second dose of Cervarix. The subject got recovered from PID and the event was considered by the 
investigator not related to Cervarix. 
 Background on pelvic inflammatory disease [CDC, 2021]: 
PID  is  a  clinical  syndrome  that  results  from  the  ascension  of  microorganisms  from  the  cervix  and 
vagina to the upper genital tract. 
A  number  of  different  microorganisms  can  cause  or  contribute  to  PID.  The  sexually  transmitted 
pathogens  C.  trachomatis  and  N.  gonorrhoeae  have  been  implicated  in  a  third  to  half  of  PID  cases. 
However, endogenous microorganisms, including gram positive and negative anaerobic organisms and 
aerobic/facultative  gram  positive  and  negative  rods  and  cocci,  found  at  high  levels  in  women  with 
bacterial  vaginosis,  also  have  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  PID.  Newer  data  suggest  that

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/620385/2021  
Page 19/22 
 
 
 
 
 
Mycoplasma  genitalium  may  also  play  a  role  in  PID  and  may  be  associated  with  milder  symptoms 
although  studies  have  failed  to  demonstrate  a  significant  increase  in  PID  following  detection  of  M. 
genitalium  in  the  lower  genital  tract.  Because  of  the  polymicrobial  nature  of  PID,  broad-spectrum 
regimens that provide adequate coverage of likely pathogens are recommended. 
PID  is  a  serious  complication  of  chlamydia  and  gonorrhea,  two  of  the  most  common  reportable 
infectious diseases and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the US. 
Clinical signs and symptoms range from unnoticeable or subtle and mild to severe, and even when the 
symptoms are mild it might be unrecognized by women and their health care providers. Despite lack of 
symptoms, histologic evidence of endometritis has been demonstrated in women with subclinical PID. 
Based on the above information, pelvic inflammatory disease is considered a consequence of infectious 
pathology and women who are sexually active or had a history of sexually transmitted diseases are at 
higher risk to develop PID in their lifetime. 
Incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in EPI-HPV-070 and other clinical studies: 
In  the  EPI-HPV-070  study  medically  attended  adverse  events  following  immunisation  (AEFI)  were 
collected  up  to  30  days  following  vaccination.  In  this  prospective  postmarketing  surveillance  study, 
only subjects who had received Cervarix were enrolled, not allowing comparison of the incidence of PID 
with subjects that did not receive Cervarix in the study. 
In  the  other  clinical  studies  performed  in  the  Cervarix  program,  medically  attended  AEFIs  were 
collected  throughout  the  entire  study  (including  the  30  days  post  vaccination  timepoint).  Since 
medically  attended  AEFIs  are  also  included  in  the  unsolicited  adverse  events  collected  up  to  30  days 
post  vaccination,  the  tables  presenting  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  unsolicited  symptoms 
classified  by  MedDRA  Primary  System  Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term  within  the  30-day  (Days  0  to 
29) post-vaccination from other studies were used to discuss the incidence of PID in the EPI-HPV-070 
study. The data from the large efficacy studies HPV-008 and HPV-039 conducted in similar age groups 
(15-25 and 18-25 years) worldwide or in China are discussed below. Furthermore, the sample size of 
the  analysis  sets  from  these  large  efficacy  studies  was  comparable  with  the  analysis  set  of  the  EPI-
HPV-070 study. 
•  HPV-008  study:  A  phase  III,  double-blind,  randomized,  controlled,  multi-center  study  to 
evaluate the efficacy of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 VLP/AS04 vaccine compared to 
hepatitis  A  vaccine  as  control  in  prevention  of  persistent  HPV-16  or  HPV-18  cervical  infection 
and cervical neoplasia, administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule in 
healthy females 15-25 years of age. 
•  HPV-039:  A  phase  II/III,  double-blind,  randomised,  controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy, 
immunogenicity  and  safety  of  GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals’  HPV-16/18  L1  VLP  AS04  vaccine 
administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 1, 6-month schedule in healthy Chinese female 
subjects aged 18-25 years. 
A summary of the data from the different studies is presented in Table 1 (Data based on Table 2 (EPI-
HPV-070), Table 3 (HPV-008) and Table 4 (HPV-039)).

Table 9 Summary table of percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence 
of pelvic inflammatory disease within the 30-days post-vaccination 
period 
The  observed  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  PID  in  the  EPI-HPV-070  study  is  in  line  with  the 
percentage observed in the HPV and control groups of the HPV-008 and HPV039 studies. 
Given the low number of reported PID cases in these studies and the above-mentioned differences in 
collection  of  data  between  the  studies,  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Based  on  the  above 
data no indication for increased incidence of PID was observed in the EPI-HPV-070 study. 
Of  note,  Goller  et  al.  (2016)  reported  that  2.8%  [95%  CI  2.5%  to  3.0%]  of  women  16–49  years 
attending an Australian sexual health clinic between 2006 and 2013, were diagnosed with PID [Goller, 
2016],  while  analysis  of  data  from  the  US  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey  2013-
2014  cycle  on  self-reported  lifetime  PID  in  sexually  experienced  women  of  reproductive  age  (18-44 
years) showed that the estimated prevalence of was 4.4% [Kreisel, 2017]. 
MAH’s Conclusion 
Pelvic  inflammatory  disease  is  considered  a  consequence  of  infectious  pathology.  Women  who  are 
sexually  active  or  had  a  history  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases  are  at  higher  risk  to  develop  PID  in 
their lifetime. The EPI-HPV-070 study was conducted in a population who are also sexually active and 
the  reports  of  PID  occurring  post  HPV  vaccination  were  coincidental  with  no  causal  association  to 
Cervarix.  Furthermore,  the  observed  incidence  of  PID  in  this  study  is  in  line  with  the  incidence 
observed in other clinical studies in similar population/ age group. 
Based on the above information and evaluation, no concern is raised regarding incidence of PID reports 
in this EPI-HPV-070 post-marketing surveillance study. 
Assessment of Applicant’s response 
In general, it is agreed, as proposed by the MAH, that Pelvic Inflammatory disease is a consequence of 
infectious pathology and that it is not clear by which mechanism a vaccine could be the cause of PID. 
Although  this  possibility  cannot  totally  be  excluded,  the  observed  number  of  cases  is  not  worrisome. 
Since  there  was  no  control  arm  in  the  EPI-HPV-070  study,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  a  direct 
comparison,  so  the  Company  has  provided  some  data  for  2  previous  large  efficacy  studies  HPV-008

and  HPV-039  conducted  in  similar  age  groups  (15-25  and  18-25  years).  Based  on  these,  it  can  be 
concluded that the observed number of cases is within the expected rate (0.1%-0.3%). 
No further regulatory action is required.

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2013 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing (4R,5R)-1-[[4-[[4-[3,3-
dibutyl-7-(dimethylamino)-2,3,4,5- tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-1,1-dioxido-1-benzothiepin-5-
yl]phenoxy]methyl]phenyl]methyl]-4-aza-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane chloride was considered 
justified based on preclinical data showing reduction of serum bile acids in a cholestasis model, 
accompanied by some reduction of liver enzymes levels. The reduction of biliary acid levels is 
known to be linked to reduction of pruritus in cholestatic diseases. Since pruritus is an important 
and chronically debilitating symptom of Alagille syndrome, the Committee considered that 
preliminary evidence of reduction of biliary acid levels supports the intention to treat the condition 
with the supposed product; 
• 
• 
• 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to hepatic and cardiac dysfunction. 
Portal hypertension develops in up to one third of patients. Life expectancy is in most cases around 
20 years and death is associated with liver failure, cardiac problems and blood vessel 
abnormalities; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting not more than 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made, based on the current available literature; 
the sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has 
been authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Alagille syndrome is a highly heterogenous, autosomal dominant multisystem condition and is caused 
by mutations in one of two genes: JAG1 and NOTCH2. It was initially described as a hepatic disease, 
but molecular testing has shown that individuals with ALGS and JAG1 or NOTCH2 mutations may 
present without overt liver disease.  
Table 1.  Summary of molecular genetic testing used in ALGS 
ALGS is a multisystem disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms ranging from life-
threatening liver or congenital cardiac defects to only subclinical manifestations, such as mildly 
abnormal liver enzymes, a heart murmur, butterfly vertebrae, posterior embryotoxon (a thickening of 
the Schwalbe's line of the cornea), or characteristic facial features. This variability is present even 
among individuals from the same family sharing the same mutation.  
Table 2.  A summary of the clinical features and the frequency reported among individuals with ALGS 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000078931 
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the majority of cases, individuals with ALGS present in infancy with cholestasis (conjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia with high GGT, increased serum bile acids, and elevated cholesterol and 
triglycerides), which manifest as jaundice, intense pruritus, xanthomas (fatty deposits on the extensor 
surfaces), and failure to thrive due to fat malabsorption.  Cardiac findings ranging from benign heart 
murmurs to significant structural defects occur in 90%–97% of individuals with ALGS.  Pulmonic 
stenosis (peripheral and branch) is the most common cardiac finding (60-67%). The most common 
complex cardiac defect is tetralogy of Fallot, which is seen in 7%–16% of individuals. Other cardiac 
malformations include ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, aortic stenosis, and coarctation of 
the aorta (in order of decreasing frequency). 
The typical facial features (see Table 2A above) are almost universally present in ALGS due to JAG1 
mutations. The typical facial features do not seem to be as prevalent in individuals with ALGS carrying 
a NOTCH2 mutation. 
The mortality is 
10%, with vascular accidents, cardiac disease, and liver disease being the most 
frequent cause of death (The Application of Clinical Genetics 2016:9 75–82). Alagille syndrome is 
∼
diagnosed when an individual has three out of seven major clinical features. See Figure 1 below for 
diagnostic framework. Individuals with an affected first-degree relative and who do not meet full 
clinical criteria but with the presence of one or more clinical features should be diagnosed with Alagille 
syndrome. Infants younger than 6 months of age may not present with a marked paucity of the bile 
ducts or even present with ductal proliferation that could lead to a misdiagnosis of biliary atresia. 
Traditionally, the clinical diagnostic criteria for ALGS included liver histology showing bile duct paucity 
(an increased portal tract-to-bile duct ratio) and three of five major clinical features: cholestasis; 
ophthalmologic abnormalities (commonly posterior embryotoxon); characteristic facial features (see 
Table 2 A); cardiac defect (see Table 2); and skeletal abnormalities (commonly butterfly vertebrae). 
The five criteria have been increased to seven which are: Cardiac defects, hepatic manifestation, renal 
abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, ophthalmologic manifestations, dysmorphic facies and 
vasculature abnormalities.  
Bile duct paucity on liver histology is no longer considered mandatory for the diagnosis of Alagille 
syndrome, the presence of cholestasis can be used instead. (Alagille Syndrome Article -

The approved therapeutic indication “Livmarli is indicated for the treatment of cholestatic 
pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) 2 months of age and older" falls within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Alagille syndrome”  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to chronic cholestasis due to paucity of 
intrahepatic bile ducts, progressing to portal hypertension and liver failure. Pruritus (itching) is 
reported as the most bothersome symptom of ALGS across all ages by patients and caregivers 
(Kamath et al. 2018b), which is difficult to treat, leads to cutaneous mutilation, mood disturbances, 
disruption of sleep and school performance, and has negative impact on physical and psychosocial 
health (Elisofon et al. 2010; Kamath et al. 2015, Kamath et al. 2018b), as well as overall Quality of 
Life (Abetz-Webb et al. 2014).  
Twenty-one percent to 31% of patients require liver transplantation during childhood, including 
approximately 50% of those diagnosed in infancy. Cardiac dysfunction also occurs due to cardiac 
defects which are reported in greater than 90% of patients and include peripheral pulmonic stenosis 
(60-67%), tetralogy of Fallot (7-16%), ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, aortic stenosis, 
and coarctation of the aorta. Associated with cardiac defects are vasculature abnormalities which when 
present, are often associated with neurovascular abnormalities such as aneurysms, Moyamoya 
syndrome, abnormalities in cerebral arteries, reno-vascular abnormalities, and middle aortic syndrome.

Intracranial bleeding can also occur. Additional involvement of other systems/organs contributes to the 
chronically debilitating nature of the disease, including butterfly vertebrae, posterior embryotoxon 
and/or anterior segment abnormalities of the eyes, pigmentary retinopathy and dysplastic kidney.  
The reported mortality is 
10%, with vascular accidents, cardiac disease, and liver disease being the 
most frequent cause of death. In a retrospective analysis of 1,154 children from 25 countries with a 
∼
clinically and/or genetically confirmed ALGS diagnosis the 18-year survival was 88.6% (Vandriel et al. 
2020). Mortality is high in the very young age because of the concurrent severe cardiac malformations.    
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor has provided a prevalence estimate based on a literature search. Several publications are 
mentioned which are derived from the Gala Study (key study in the development of maralixibat 
chloride (Kamath et al 2020, Vandriel et al 2020 and Kamath et al 2018). This data is supplement with 
a publication from Australia (Danks et al 1977) and a revision from 2014 (Leonard et al 2014). One 
publication identified the incidence of the condition, Langlois and Scheuerle 2015 which is derived from 
a Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) in the USA. Finally, a publication from Kamath et al from 2003 
was used to describe the incidence of live births of the condition which is proposed as 1.74 in 100,000.  
The sponsor acknowledges in their submission that detection of the condition in Europe is difficult 
which can compromise the prevalence estimate. The final proposed incidence of the condition is 3.16 in 
100,000. Life expectancy is proposed to be slightly less than normal where the sponsor proposed that: 
•  Normal life-years for 100 individuals would be 100 X 70 = 7,000 years 
•  11% of Alagille syndrome patients would live no more than 18 years (198 life-years) and 89% 
would have a normal lifespan (6,230 life-years) 
•  Alagille life-years vs normal life-years would be 6,428/7000 = 0.92

Table 3.  Adjustment of birth incidence to arrive at prevalence 
The sponsor proposed a final estimate of 0.3 in 10,000 to be the current prevalence in the European 
Union. This is similar to the prevalence estimate as established at the orphan designation back in 
2013. There are no reasons to consider that the prevalence of this hereditary disease has changed 
much since the orphan designation in 2013.  
The COMP accepted this final estimate.  
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There are no formal European Guidelines regarding the management and treatment of these patients.  
The sponsor indicates that there are no products authorised for the condition in Europe. It appears 
therefore that nothing has changed since the original orphan designation in 2013. It is noted by the 
COMP that off-label use of several products is reported like: ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, 
rifampicin and naltrexone. These products are tried for the management of pruritus and xanthoma but 
typically have limited success (Kronsten et al. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2013 Aug;57(2):149-54). 
Surgical interventions are used to treat cholestatic disease in ALGS and include surgical biliary 
diversion (SBD) procedures and liver transplantation. SBD procedures may not be fully effective and 
can lead to electrolyte disturbances and dehydration (Emerick et al. 1999; Kamath et al. 2018). Liver 
transplantation is associated with considerable safety risks, and donors are limited available.  
The COMP concluded that the currently available methods and treatments are not satisfactory.  
Significant benefit 
Not applicable.

4.  COMP position adopted on 18 October 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of Alagille syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.3 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to severe pruritus, cholestasis, liver 
failure, and congenital cardiac defects. Life expectancy is in most cases around 20 years and death 
is associated with blood vessel abnormalities, cardiac failure and end-stage liver disease; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of Alagillle syndrome that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Livmarli, (4R,5R)-1-[[4-[[4-[3,3-
dibutyl-7-(dimethylamino)-2,3,4,5- tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-1,1-dioxido-1-benzothiepin-5-
yl]phenoxy]methyl]phenyl]methyl]-4-aza-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane chloride, Maralixibat chloride 
for treatment of Alagille syndrome (EU/3/13/1214) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

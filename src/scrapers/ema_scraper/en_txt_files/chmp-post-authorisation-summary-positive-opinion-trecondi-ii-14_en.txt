Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Trecondi 
treosulfan 
On 26 January 2023, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Trecondi. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is medac Gesellschaft für klinische 
Spezialpräparate mbH. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication to include treatment of non-malignant diseases 
in paediatric patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For information, the 
full indication for Trecondi will therefore be as follows:2
Treosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to 
allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant 
and non-malignant diseases, and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant 
and non-malignant diseases. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

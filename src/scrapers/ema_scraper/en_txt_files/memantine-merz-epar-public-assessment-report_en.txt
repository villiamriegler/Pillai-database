1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier

Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Memantine Merz, through the centralised

procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 15 March 2012. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer’s 
disease. 
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 10(c) Informed consent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information together with a letter from Merz 
Pharmaceuticals GmbH allowing use to be made of relevant quality, non-clinical and/or clinical data of 
the original marketing authorisation for Axura (EU/1/02/218//001-030). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Not applicable 
Scientific Advice 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
Licensing status 
The product was not licensed in any country at the time of submission of the application. The original 
medicinal product Axura was approved in the EU on 17 May 2002. 
1.2.  Steps taken for the assessment of the product

2.  Scientific discussion 
1.3.  Introduction 
This  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Memantine  Merz  has  been  submitted  by  Merz 
Pharmaceuticals GmbH as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c of Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended. 
The  MAH  (Merz  Pharmaceuticals  GmbH)  for  Axura,  which  was  authorised  on  17  May  2002,  provided 
consent to make use of the pharmaceutical, non-clinical and clinical documentation of the initial dossier 
of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-marketing  procedures  submitted,  assessed  and 
approved. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Memantine-Merz medicinal product are identical 
to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Axura. The application for Memantine Merz 
concerns  the  identical  strengths  to  those  approved  for  Axura  and  consists  of  only  Module  1. 
Information on the scientific discussion can be found in the Axura CHMP assessment reports and in the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. 
The approved indication is: Treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. 
Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Axura application, the quality data in support of the 
Memantine  Merz  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Axura  dossier,  which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
1.4.  Non- clinical aspects  
1.4.1.  Introduction 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Axura application, the non-clinical data in support 
of  the  Memantine  Merz  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Axura 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved. 
1.4.2.  Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. However, as the introduction of Memantine Merz is 
considered  unlikely  to  result  in  any  significant  increase  in  the  combined  sales  volumes  for  all 
memantine  containing  products  and  the  exposure  of  the  environment  to  the  active  substance,  the 
enviromental risk is expected to be similar and not increased. 
1.5.  Clinical aspects  
Since this application is an informed consent of the Axura application, the clinical data in support of the 
Memantine  Merz  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  the  Axura  dossier,  which 
have been assessed and approved.

1.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.  
Risk management plan 
The applicant submitted a risk management plan in line with the reference product Axura. 
Table 1.  Summary of the risk management plan 
The below pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance are needed 
to investigate further prostate cancer safety concerns:  
Description 
Due date 
Epidemiologic population based case control study  
The study is planned to be evaluated and 
reported until Q3 2013. 
No additional risk minimisation activities were required. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should provide an updated RMP taking into account 
the currently on-going finalisation of the study protocol for the required post-authorisation safety study 
investigating “memantine use and prostate cancer”  as soon as available in the post-marketing 
authorisation setting.

PSUR submission 
The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product, which is 
currently on a 1 yearly cycle. The next data lock point for the reference medicinal product is 15 
September 2012. 
User consultation 
The Package Leaflet of Axura has been successfully user tested in the framework of its evaluation for 
which the CHMP opinion was adopted on 17 May 2012. Since the proposed Package Leaflet for the 
current application is identical to the Package Leaflet for Axura except for the product-specific 
information, no further testing is warranted. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This  Marketing  Authorisation  application  for  Memantine  Merz  (memantine  hydrochloride)  has  been 
submitted by Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH as an informed consent application of Axura in accordance 
with Article 10c of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Memantine Merz medicinal product are identical 
to the up-to-date quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of the reference product.  
The application for Memantine Merz concerns the identical strengths to those approved for Axura.  
In  line  with  the  assessment  of  data  undertaken  in  the  framework  of  the  Axura  initial  marketing 
authorisation  application  as  well  as  within  all  post-autorisation  procedures,  the  CHMP  considers  that 
the benefit/risk balance for Memantine Merz is positive.  
Information on the scientific discussion can be found on the Axura CHMP assessment reports and in the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Memantine Merz in the treatment of treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is 
favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the 
following conditions:  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Pharmacovigilance System

agreed in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation

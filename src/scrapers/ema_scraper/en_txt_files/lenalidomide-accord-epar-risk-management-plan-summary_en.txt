Summary of risk management plan for Lenalidomide 
Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 
mg, 20mg and 25 mg) (Lenalidomide) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules 
(2.5  mg,  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg,  20mg  and  25  mg).  The  RMP  details  important  risks  of 
Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg and 25 mg), how 
these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Lenalidomide 
Accord  hard  capsules  (2.5  mg,  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg,  20mg  and  25  mg)’s  risks  and 
uncertainties (missing information). 
Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg and 25 mg)'s 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 
7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg and 25 mg) should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 
15  mg,  20mg  and  25  mg)  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information  including  the 
assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Lenalidomide 
Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg and 25 mg)’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg) is 
authorised  for  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma,  Myelodysplastic  syndromes,  Mantle  cell 
lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains lenalidomide as 
the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
 
 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important risks of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg 
and 25 mg), together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning 
more about Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20mg and 
25 mg)'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg 
and 25 mg), these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment and signal management activity, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 
20mg and 25 mg) are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can 
be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 
15 mg, 20 mg and 25 mg). Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of 
this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
 
 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine);

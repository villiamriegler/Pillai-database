PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR PHESGO 
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Phesgo (pertuzumab and 
trastuzumab fixed dose combination for subcutaneous injection).  The RMP details 
important risks of Phesgo, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Phesgo’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Phesgo’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Phesgo should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Phesgo should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).   
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Phesgo’s RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
I. 
Phesgo is authorized for metastatic and early breast cancers (see SmPC for the full 
indication).  It contains pertuzumab and trastuzumab as the active substance, and it is 
given by subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Phesgo’s benefits can be found in Phesgo’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web site, under 
the medicine’s Web page. 
II. 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Phesgo, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Phesgo’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly. 
The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
 
 
 
Important information that may affect the safe use of Phesgo is not yet available, and it 
is listed under “missing Information” below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Phesgo are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Phesgo.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk factors such as age of 60 years or older, prior 
chemotherapy, registration left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) less than 65%, hypertension and use of 
antihypertensive medications such as angiotensin-converting-
enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blockers and β-
blockers were associated with an increased risk of cardiac 
events in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer      
(Advani et al. 2016; Russo et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2015).

Important Potential Risk:  Oligohydramnios 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Oligohydramnios has not been reported in patients treated 
with Phesgo but occurred in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered pertuzumab and in pregnant women treated with 
trastuzumab. No clinical studies have been performed in 
pregnant women. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Premenopausal women of childbearing potential are at risk of 
this complication if they become pregnant during treatment. 
Since the median age at diagnosis of HER2-positive breast 
cancer is the mid-50s, at least half the patients likely to receive  
Phesgo treatment are unlikely to become pregnant on the 
grounds of age alone. In addition, prior chemotherapy in the 
adjuvant setting and concurrent chemotherapy in the 
metastatic setting are likely to reduce the chances of 
conception, implantation and embryogenesis due to induction 
of a premature menopause and the anti-proliferative effects of 
chemotherapy. Finally, the advanced stage of disease and 
poor prognosis of patients with MBC make pregnancies less 
likely to occur. 
Opioid abuse or dependence during pregnancy markedly 
increased the odds of oligohydramnios (Maeda et al. 2014). 
Pregnant women with sickle cell disease are at increased risk 
of oligohydramnios (Kuo and Caughey 2016). Primiparity is 
associated with an increased rate of oligohydramnios  
(Wielgos et al. 2015).

Important Potential Risk:  Lack of efficacy due to immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
The risk of lack of efficacy due to immunogenicity is 
determined to be low and is confirmed by the low incidence 
and negligible impact of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs, 
previously known as anti-therapeutic antibodies or ATAs, 
which are the result of an unwanted response caused by the 
body’s immune response to a treatment and can render the 
treatment ineffective or cause adverse events) to date in 
pertuzumab (IV) clinical studies, as well as experience of 
immunogenicity of trastuzumab (SC) and rHuPH20 in previous 
clinical studies. Immunogenicity data available at the time of 
the primary analysis of Study WO40324 (FeDeriCa) also 
further confirms the low risk. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk factors for the development of ADAs have been 
described in various regulatory guidance documents and 
industry white papers (EMEA 2007; FDA 2014; Koren et al. 
2008), and includes genetic factors, patient immune status, 
and concomitant medications.  However, there is currently no 
way to predict which patients will generate ADAs and of these 
which (if any) will lose drug benefits as a result.

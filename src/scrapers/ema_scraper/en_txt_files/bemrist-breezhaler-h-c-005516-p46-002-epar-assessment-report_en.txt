1. Introduction 
On 04/10/2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for QMF149 75/40 µg indacaterol 
acetate/mometasone furoate fixed dose combination (Bemrist Breezhaler EMEA/H/C/005516) in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that CQMF149G2203 is a study provided in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The Twisthaler inhaler (TH) is a multi-dose dry powder inhaler, with all doses pre-loaded in the device. 
The Concept 1 Breezhaler (C1) device is a unit dose dry powder inhaler, which requires loading of the 
dose prior to each use. The following medication/devices will be prepared by Novartis and supplied to 
the Investigator as open labelled medication: 
• 
• 
Treatment A: Mometasone furoate (MF) delivered via Twisthaler inhaler, (MF 100 µg TH) 
Treatment B: Fixed dose combination of 75 µg indacaterol acetate and 40 µg mometasone 
furoate delivered as powder in hard capsules via Concept1 Breezhaler inhaler (QMF149 75/40 
µg C1)

•  CQMF149G2203: An open-label, two-period, single-sequence, crossover study to compare the 
systemic exposure of a single inhaled dose of mometasone furoate (MF) when administered 
alone via the MF Twisthaler (TH) to a single inhaled dose of QMF149 75/40 µg indacaterol 
acetate/MF fixed dose combination when administered via the Concept 1 (Breezhaler) device in 
≥ 6 to <12 year old asthma patients  
The date of completion (last subject last visit) of this study was 11 April 2022. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CQMF149G2203 
CQMF149G2203 was a Phase 2 open-label, two-period, single-sequence, crossover study to compare 
the systemic exposure of a single inhaled dose of mometasone furoate (MF) when administered alone 
via the MF Twisthaler (TH) to a single inhaled dose of QMF149 indacaterol acetate/MF fixed dose 
combination when administered via the Concept 1 (C1) (Breezhaler) device in ≥ 6 to < 12 year old 
asthma patients. 
A total of 24 subjects were enrolled, all of whom completed both treatment visits. None of the enrolled 
subjects discontinued. On the first treatment visit (Day 1) subjects received a single inhaled dose of 
100 μg MF administered via the TH device followed by a 4-day washout period. On the second 
treatment visit (Day 6) subjects received a single inhaled dose of 75/40 μg indacaterol acetate/MF 
(QMF149 75/40 µg) via the C1 device. Subjects were stratified into 2 age groups; ≥ 6 to < 9 years and 
≥ 9 to < 12 years (at least 6 subjects in each of the 2 age groups). 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the systemic exposure of MF resulting from single 
orally inhaled doses of QMF149 75/40 µg administered via the C1 unit dose dry powder inhaler versus 
the 100μg MF TH metered dose dry powder inhaler in paediatric asthma subjects (≥ 6 to < 12 years of 
age). The PK parameters used for this study were the AUC0-6h and Cmax of MF after single dose 
administration of QMF149 75/40 µg C1 and 100μg MF TH. The secondary objectives were to evaluate 
the systemic exposure of indacaterol resulting from a single orally inhaled dose of QMF149 75/40 µg 
and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QMF149 75/40 µg after single dose administration in 
paediatric subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The subjects in this study received a single dose from single unused (unprimed) C1 and TH devices. 
Unprimed devices are not coated with the formulation, and therefore may lead to lower fine particle 
mass (FPM) and delivered dose compared to later doses actuated from the device throughout its use 
time. Therefore, a correction factor was applied that took into account this first-dose effect. 
Table 2 presents the summary statistics for the relevant PK parameters, corrected for first dose effect. 
Table 3 presents the Statistical analysis of primary MF plasma parameters, corrected for first dose 
effect. The Cmax of MF was similar between both formulations, as reflected by the geometric mean 
ratio of 1.09 (90% CI: 0.93, 1.28) (Table 3). Median Tmax of MF from QMF149 75/40 µg C1 (0.56 h) 
was reached earlier compared to MF TH (1.07 h) (Table 2), suggesting faster absorption of MF from 
lungs into systemic circulation from QMF149 75/40 µg C1 versus 100 µg MF TH. 
The geometric mean ratio of AUC0-6h of MF from QMF149 75/40 µg C1 vs 100 µg MF TH was 0.88 
(90%CI: 0.74, 1.06), indicating a similar exposure of MF from the two formulations. For a few subjects 
where the last PK sample was collected slightly earlier than the planned 6h time point and the 
exposure profile did not allow for extrapolation of MF exposure to 6h, the AUC0-6h parameter could 
not be calculated.

QMF149 75/40 µg C1 utilized for the study was stored under special conditions of 5°C ± 3°C, aiming 
to avoid any equilibration changes of the FPM over the duration of the study. At the target storage 
conditions of < 25°C, the FPM of MF is expected to increase by approximately 20% compared to the 
5°C ± 3°C storage conditions and therefore an increased MF exposure from QMF149 75/40 µg C1 
could be expected. The Applicant hypothesises this could bridge the exposure gap of the GeoMean 
Ratio to be closer to 1. 
There were no apparent differences in exposure were observed between the two age groups of ≥ 6 to 
< 9 years old and ≥ 9 to < 12 years old.

PK parameter estimation was not carried out for indacaterol. The corrected summary statistics of 
indacaterol concentration over time are presented below in Table 4. Systemic exposure to indacaterol 
from QMF149 75/40 µg C1 pre-dose, and at 0.25 h (mean 102 pg/ml; median 87.6 pg/mL ) and 1 h 
(mean 62.3 pg/mL; median 63 pg/mL) post-dose was determined.

Safety Results 
Three subjects (12.5%) experienced treatment-emergent AEs during the 100 µg MF TH treatment 
period, which are presented in more detail in Table 5. One subject experienced an AE of influenza, 
which was moderate in severity and was resolved. Two subjects experienced AEs of device failure, 
which were mild in severity and related to the Twisthaler device that was used for treatment 
administration on Day 1. None of the observed AEs were suspected to be related to the study drug. No 
clinically meaningful changes in laboratory parameters, vital signs, or ECGs were observed.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The design and methodology for Study CQMF149G2203 are acceptable. No participants were excluded 
from analysis sets and missing data points that could not be extrapolated were adequately described. 
This study shows that the systemic exposure of MF from single orally inhaled doses of both the 
QMF149 75/40 µg C1 and 100 µg MF TH preparations are broadly comparable in paediatric asthma 
subjects. There were no apparent differences in exposure between the two age groups. 
QMF149 75/40 µg C1 was well tolerated following single dose administration in paediatric subjects – no 
AEs were reported.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Ravicti 
glycerol phenylbutyrate 
On 15 November 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Ravicti. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Horizon Pharma Ireland Limited. 
The CHMP adopted a change to the existing indication as follows:2 
“Ravicti is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy for chronic management of adult and paediatric 
patients ≥ 2 months of age with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) including deficiencies of carbamoyl 
phosphate synthetase I (CPS), ornithine carbamoyltransferase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase 
(ASS), argininosuccinate lyase (ASL), arginase I (ARG) and ornithine translocase deficiency 
hyperornithinaemia-hyperammonaemia homocitrullinuria syndrome (HHH) who cannot be managed 
by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.  
Ravicti must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., 
essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free calorie supplements).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

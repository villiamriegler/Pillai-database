Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for vortioxetine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
- The review of a signal for anaphylactic reaction reported a total of 40 post-marketing cases, including 
seven  where  causality  with  vortioxetine  treatment  was  considered  possible.  Most  cases  were  a 
combination of airway and skin symptoms. In 1 case, anaphylactic shock was reported.  
Based on the above, it was considered that anaphylactic reaction should be included as an adverse drug 
reaction in the product information of vortioxetine.  
-    Based  upon  the  role  of  serotonin  on  haemostasis,  the  mechanism  of  action  of  vortioxetine  and  63 
post-marketing cases retrieved from a signal for haemorrhage with possible causality with vortioxetine, it 
was  considered  that  haemorrhage  should  be  included  as  an  adverse  drug  reaction  in  the  product 
information of vortioxetine. Additionally, the class warning on haemorrhage should be updated, to add that 
haemorrhage has been reported with vortioxetine as well. 
-   Based upon the review of a signal for rash, a plausible temporal relationship was concluded in several 
post-marketing cases reported (74% of reported time to onset was within one week and 93% was within 
one  month),  including  cases  with  positive  de-  or  re-challenge  (respectively  135  and  8  cases). 
Consequently, it was concluded that rash should be included as an adverse drug reaction in the product 
information of vortioxetine. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

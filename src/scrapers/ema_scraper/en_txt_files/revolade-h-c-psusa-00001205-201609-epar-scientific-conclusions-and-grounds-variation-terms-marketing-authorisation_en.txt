Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for eltrombopag, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
There are currently educational materials for the first approved indication ITP in place. The review of the 
materials  demonstrated  that  the  product  information  contains  the  same  messages  related  to  the 
important identified and potential risks as the currently approved educational material. Therefore and 
taking also into account that the initial objectives to increase the awareness of the healthcare providers 
and patients of the relevant safety concerns have been met and the key elements to be included in the 
educational material reflected in Annex II are considered now part of the standard of care; that the 
safety profile of eltrombopag as is currently characterised is reflected in the product information; the 
PRAC recommends a variation to remove conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective 
use of the medicinal product as detailed in Annex II.D and 127a. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for eltrombopag the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing eltrombopag is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II and PL 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Zentiva in the 
approved indication remains favourable and therefore 
recommended the renewal of the marketing authorisation 
with unlimited validity.

RECOMMENDATION 
The MAH has fulfilled its obligations towards article 45 of the of the paediatric regulation 
EC/1901/2006, and as such this FUM can be considered fulfilled and grantable. 
II. 
INTRODUCTION 
Levetiracetam  (LEV),  a  pyrrolidone  derivative,  is  an  antiepileptic  drug  (AED)  structurally 
unrelated to any other known AED. The exact way in which levetiracetam works is still unclear 
but it seems to interfere with a protein called the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, which is found in 
the space between nerves (synapses) and stops the release of chemical messengers between 
nerve cells. This helps to stabilise electrical activity in the brain and prevent seizures. 
The product is used to treat partial onset seizures (fits) with or without secondary generalization, 
or as an adjunctive therapy in patients suffering from: 
  partial onset seizures with or without generalisation in patients from four years of age 
  myoclonic seizures (short, shock-like jerks of a muscle or group of muscles) in patients from 
12 years of age with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy 
  primary  generalised  tonic-clonic  seizures  (major  fits,  including  loss  of  consciousness)  in 
patients from 12 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy (the type of epilepsy that is 
thought to have a genetic cause) 
Keppra (levetiracetam) is available in the European Union as 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 
mg tablets, 100 mg/mL oral solution, and 5 mg/5mL concentrate for solution for infusion.µ 
III. 
TYPE OF APPLICATION 
In  the  frame  of  the  article  45  of  the  paediatric  regulation  EC/1901/2006,  UCB  provided  in 
January  2008  a  listing  with  all  submitted  and  not  yet  submitted  paediatric  clinical  data  on  the 
medicinal  products  registered  by  UCB  or  its  affiliates  in  the  Union.  In  December  2008,  UCB 
provided  the  EMEA  with  the  actual  data  listed  previously  as  having  never  been  submitted  by 
UCB  to  the  Competent  Authority  in  the  frame  of  a  paediatric  filing.  This  assessment  concerns 
the overview of these studies. 
IV. 
SUBMITTED STUDIES 
The MAH submitted 8 studies, see table 1, in compliance with the requisite of art. 45. Neither of 
these  studies  had  investigations  in  paediatric  patients  as  an  objective,  but  some  of  the 
participating subjects were under the age of 18 at time of inclusion. As such they were protocol 
deviators. In the frame of compliance with art. 45 EC/1901/2006, the MAH only focused on these 
subjects.  The  safety  data  pertaining  to  those  patients  have  been  extracted  from  the  total 
population, with the aim of investigating if any new safety signal would be observed, that would 
alter  the  known  benefit/risk  in  paediatric  patients.  Since  those  data  only  include  a few  patients 
per trial under the age of 18 years, The MAH argued that no relevant information on efficacy in 
children/adolescents can be derived from those reports. 
CHMP comment:

EFFICACY 
Due to the low number of patients below the age of 18 in each trial no relevant information could 
be  gleamed  from  the  reports.  The  MAH  therefore  makes  reference  to  the  registered  data 
evidencing efficacy in paediatric patients. 
CHMP comment: 
The  MAH’s  sentiment  regarding  the  fact  that  due  to  the  low  number  of  paediatric  subjects  in 
each study comprehensive paediatric efficacy conclusions could not be drawn is corroborated. 
VIII.  SAFETY

1.  A  Multicenter,  Double-Blind,  Follow-Up  Trial  Evaluating  The  Longterm  Safety  Of 
Levetiracetam (1000 To 3000 Mg/Day B.I.D.) And Carbamazepine (400 To 1200 Mg/Day Oral 
B.I.D.), Used As Monotherapy In Subjects (16 Years) Coming From The N01061 Trial 
This study was a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group monotherapy long-term follow-up trial. 
The  main  objectives  were  to  allow  the  subjects  having  benefited  from  levetiracetam  or 
carbamazepine monotherapy in study N01061 to remain on the same investigational product, to 
ensure  blindness  of  N01061  treatment  identity  until  N01061  database  lock  and  to  continue  to 
assess the safety of LEV as per adverse event reporting. 
Subjects  included  in  the  trial  were  to  be  16  years  or  older  and  newly  diagnosed  with  epilepsy 
(partial  onset  seizures  with  clear  focal  origin  or  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  without  clear 
focal origin) and had to be previous participants of the double-blind monotherapy study N01061. 
In total 335 (of which 171 took levetiracetam) subjects entered the follow-up study. 6 subjects of 
the LEV and 6 subjects of the CBZ groups were below 18 years of age (mean age equal to 16.9 
and 16.6 respectively). Male representation was 66.7% and 16.7% in both groups respectively. 
In each group three of the sub-18 subjects reported an adverse event. Two subjects in the LEV 
group  and  one  in  the  CBZ  group  reported  a  drug-related  AE  (see  table  2).  No  AEs  leading  to 
premature discontinuation or SAEs were reported at all.

  One  patient  each  reported:  diarrhoea,  ligament 
sprain, weight increased (ADR) 
  Two  patients  each  reported:  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection, headache, pharyngolaryngeal pain. 
  One  patient  each  reported:  eye  allergy,  influenza, 
hockey  injury,  lymphocyte  count  decreased  (ADR), 
headache, acne (ADR) 
2.  A  Phase  Iv  -  Pharmacovigilance  Study  Of  Keppra(R)  Greece  -  S.K.A.T.E.:  Safety  Of 
Keppra(R) As Adjunctive Therapy In Epilepsy 
This  trial  was  a  multi-center,  Phase  IV  pharmacovigilance  therapeutic  use  study.  The  trial  was 
stopped  one  year  after  the  recruitment  of  the  first  subject.  The  aim  of  this  trial  was  to  further 
assess the safety of Keppra, to assess the optimal dose in daily clinical practice and to evaluate 
the efficacy of Keppra in community-based practice. 
Subjects  received  levetiracetam  in  a  mean  daily  dose  of  1382.1  mg  (SD  =  257.7  mg)  and  the 
median duration of exposure over that period was 99 days. 
35  Caucasian  subjects  entered  the  study  of  which  one  was  a  female  patient  aged  17  at  the 
study’s  start.  She  received  2000  mg  of  Keppra  per  day.  She  reported  a  non-serious  mood 
alteration NOS, assessed as unlikely related to study drug, which resolved in 17 days after LEV 
dose reduction. 
3.  A  Korean  Open-Label,  Multi-Center,  Community-Based  Trial  Assessing  The  Efficacy  And 
Safety  Of  Levetiracetam  As  Adjunctive  Therapy  In  Adult  Subjects  With  Uncontrolled  Partial 
Epilepsy For Bridging Purpose With A Similar Study On Caucasian Epileptic Subjects 
This  trial  was  a  multi-center,  open-label,  add-on  study  without  control  group  which  had  as 
objectives the evaluation of levetiracetam efficacy in community-based epileptic population with 
partial onset seizures and to obtain further information about optimal dose in daily practice and 
the further evaluation of the safety and the tolerability of levetiracetam in a broad population of 
epileptic subjects and confirm the favorable safety of the drug found during clinical development. 
The drug was administered at doses ranging from 1000 mg/day to 3000 mg/day and the study 
lasted between 16 and 22 weeks for each participant.

One  patient  below  18  years  was  in  accordance  with  the  inclusion  criteria  of  having  epilepsy 
experiencing  partial  seizure,  whether  or  not  secondarily  generalized,  that  were  classifiable 
according to the International Classification of Epileptic Seizure and having at least three and no 
more than forty-two partial seizures over a 3-month historical baseline, while taking at least one 
but no more than two concomitant marketed antiepileptic drugs at stable dose. The subject was 
a 17 years old female patient receiving 1000 mg of Keppra per day. She experienced no AEs. 
4. A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Study: 16-Week Evaluation Of The Efficacy 
And Safety Of Levetiracetam (Lev) As Add-on Therapy In Adults And Adolescents Older Than 
16 Years Suffering From Partial Seizures 
The  objective  of  this  double  blind,  randomized  (1:1),  placebo-controlled,  multicenter,  parallel 
group study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Keppra when used as an add-on 
therapy in adult and adolescent Chinese subjects older than 16 years. The study period covered 
20 weeks and included a retrospective historical baseline, randomization, the 16-week treatment 
period  and  either  down  titration  for  up  to  four  weeks  or  a  switch  to  long-term  Levetiracetam 
therapy. 
Thirteen patients in the levetiracetam group and nine in the placebo group were younger than 18 
years (mean ages were 15.8 and 16.3 respectively), and fulfilled the inclusion criteria of having 
epilepsy with partial onset seizures (classifiable according to the ILAE classification of epileptic 
seizures) and having had at least eight partial seizures with or without secondary generalization 
(type  IA,  IB  or  IC)  during  the  8-  week  historical  baseline  period.  Neither  of  them  had  been 
exposed to more than two classical stable AEDs before the selection visit. None of the subjects 
reported any AEs during the course of the study. 
5. K.E.E.P.E.R. (Keppra Epilepsy Evaluation Of Patient Time To Response). A Phase Iv, Open-
Label,  Multi-Center,  Community-Based  Trial  Studying  The  Safety  And  Efficacy  Of 
Levetiracetam As Add-On Therapy In Adult Patients With Treatment-Resistant, Partial-Onset 
Epilepsy 
This open-label multicenter study aimed to gather additional data on the safety and tolerability of 
the  administration  of  LEV  used  as  an  add-on  therapy  in  patients  with  partial  onset  seizures  in 
community-based  practices,  and  to  measure  the  seizure  reduction  effect  at  the  protocol-
determined final doses (up to 3,000 mg/day). 
Subjects underwent a 16 weeks treatment period, including four weeks of dose adjustment and 
a  12  week  period  receiving  the  target  dose.  After  completion  of  the  study,  patients  could 
continue to receive levetiracetam by conversion to prescription. For purposes of evaluation, the 
patient's  dose  remained  stable  after  Visit  3  unless,  in  the  investigator's  opinion,  a  dosage 
modification was clinically necessary to achieve maximum benefit or was of medical concern. 
Twenty-one patients in the levetiracetam group were <18 years (mean age = 16.5). They were 
about  equally  distributed  in  gender  and  66.7%  were  of  Caucasian  descent.  Nine  of  these 
patients  (or  42.9%)  reported  at  least  one  adverse  event.  Drug  related  adverse  events  were 
observed  in  8  patients  (38.1%).  In  two  subjects  (9.5%)  3  adverse  events  leading  to  premature 
discontinuation  were  observed:  one  patient  reported  gastrointestinal  distress  with  nausea  and 
vomiting while the other reported increased seizure activity. None were serious adverse events. 
6. Anwendung Der In Deutschland Zugelassenen Keppra(R) – Tabletten Als Zusatzbehandlung 
Bei Erwachsenen Patienten Mit Fokalen Epilepsien 
In  this  observational  study,  meant  to  gather  data  relating  to  the  efficacy,  tolerability  and 
undesirable  effects  of  Keppra,  thirty-four  patients  were  younger  than  18  years  (mean  age  was 
14.6  years).  15  of  the  subjects  were  males.  The  product  dose  was  at  study  start  on  average 
1052.8 mg, at the intermediate visit it was 1844.4 mg and at study end 2270.3 mg. The minimum 
treatment duration was 3 months. 
Three of the under eighteen subjects reported at least one AE. 2 of them suffered from asthenia, 
one from convulsions and one from pneumonia (which was a SAE).

7.  A  Phase  IV,  Open-Label,  Multi-Center  Community-Based  Trial  Studying  The  Safety  And 
Efficacy  Of  Keppra.  As  Adjunctive  Therapy  In  Adult  Patients  With  Uncontrolled  Partial 
Epilepsy. S.K.A.T.E.: Safety Of Keppra. As Adjunctive Therapy In Epilepsy 
This multi-center open-label uncontrolled trial, focusing on the add-on therapeutic use of Keppra, 
aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Keppra in community-based practice and to further assess its 
safety. Furthermore, the optimal dose in daily clinical practice within the dose range 1000-3000 
mg  was  to  be  assessed.  Subjects,  who  were  to  be  16  years  or  older  and  experiencing  partial 
(secondarily  generalized)  ICES  classifiable  seizure,  would  be  treated  for  sixteen  to  twenty-two 
weeks. Participants also had to have at least one and no more than fourteen partial seizures per 
month as averaged over a 3-month historical baseline, and be taking at least one but no more 
than two concomitant marketed AEDs at stable dose. 
The  treatment  consisted  of  a  starting  dose  of  1000  mg/day  for  every  subject.  Over  the  first  4 
weeks,  this  dose  could  be  increased  by  1000  mg/day  every  2  weeks  depending  on  the 
investigators’ assessment of seizure control and tolerability, up to a maximum of 3000 mg/day. 
In  total  42  participating  subjects  were  younger  than  18  years  with  a  mean  age  of  16.2  years. 
40.5%  of  the  subjects  were  male,  while  those  of  Caucasian  descent  made  up  83.3%  of  the 
group. Seventeen patients (40.5%) reported at least one AE, and 38.1% reported a drug related 
AE.  Three  patients  (7.1%)  prematurely  discontinued  the  study  due  to  adverse  events 
(somnolence, aggression and mental disorder). The latter was also a serious adverse event. 
8. Bridging Study Of L059 (Levetiracetam) In Patients With Epilepsy By Double Blind Method 
This trial (multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with 3 parallel groups) 
was meant to evaluate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam in treatment of refractory epileptic 
patients  with  partial  onset  seizures  in  the  Japanese  population,  whom  were  being  treated  with 
one to three standard anti-epileptic drugs. 
Patients were to receive either 1000 mg/day, 3000 mg/day or placebo in addition to their normal 
AEDs. Study medication was up-titrated during a 4-week titration period to reach the target daily 
dosage  that  was  maintained  during  a  12-week  evaluation  period.  Afterwards  subjects  went 
through either a 4-week withdrawal (down-titration) or a 6-week transition period to next follow-
up study N01020. 
Patients deemed fit for inclusion had to experience simple and/or complex partial seizures with 
or without secondary generalization, and have a minimum of twelve partial seizures during the 
12-week baseline period with at least 2 seizures every four weeks. 
Amongst the study population were eleven subjects <18 Years. Three were part of the placebo 
group,  two of  the  LEV 1000  mg  group  and  six  of  the  3000  mg  group.  The  mean ages  in  each 
group were 16.3, 17.0 and 16.0 respectively. Nine patients were of male gender. 
All patients reported at least one adverse event, 2 patients of the levetiracetam 3000 mg group 
reported drug related adverse events: Blood alkaline phosphatase increased and Urinary occult 
blood positive in one patient each. None of the adverse events led to early discontinuation; one 
patient reported a serious adverse event in the placebo group: pneumonia NOS. 
IX. 
CONCLUSION 
The  MAH  presented  additional  data  on  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  levetiracetam  on  125 
patients below the age of 18 years which were on a regime of levetiracetam at doses between 
1000 and 3000 mg/day. The exposure durations ranged from sixteen weeks to one year. 
In  total  fifty-one  patients  (or  41%)  reported  at  least  one  AE.  28  patients  (22%)  reported  AEs 
which were considered to be drug-related. 
No  unknown  types  of  adverse  event  were  uncovered  during  the  study  review,  as  most  were 
nervous  system  or  psychiatric  disorders.  All  AEs  had  already  been  reported  in  previously 
submitted clinical trials and are listed in levetiracetam Summary of Product Characteristics.

In  conclusion,  since  also  those  patients  cannot  be  taken  into  account  for  the  evaluation  of 
efficacy,  the  MAH  considers  that  there  is  no  change  in  levetiracetam’s  registered  risk-benefit 
assessment  in  paediatric  patients  based  upon  this  additional  set  of  data  collected  in  children 
younger than 18 years. 
X. 
CHMP CONCLUSION 
The  MAH’s  conclusions  are  corroborated.  None  of  the  submitted  studies  seem  to  indicate 
apparent  problems  in  subjects  <18  years  of  age.  One  should  of  course  keep  in  mind  that  this 
conclusion is based on rather limited data. 
It is thus the CHMP opinion that the MAH can be considered to have fulfilled its obligations with 
regard to article 45 of the paediatric regulation EC/1901/2006. As a result, the present FUM can 
be can be considered as fulfilled.

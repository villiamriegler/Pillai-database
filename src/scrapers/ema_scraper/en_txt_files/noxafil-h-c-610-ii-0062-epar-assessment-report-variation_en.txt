2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This variation, supported by the results of a single Phase 3 study, MK-5592-069 (hereafter referred to 
as P069), proposed to extend the use of posaconazole (POS) to include first-line treatment of invasive 
aspergillosis (IA). The formulations of POS proposed to be used for this indication are the tablets and 
the solution for infusion.  
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Aspergillus species are filamentous fungi, commonly found in the environment that cause a wide 
spectrum of infections in humans; these infections can be acute and life-threatening, primarily in 
immunocompromised individuals. Among over 250 species of Aspergillus, fewer than 40 are known to 
cause human infection; of these, Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of infections in 
humans and the most common cause of serious, invasive disease. 
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious, life-threatening disease among patients with prolonged and/or 
severe impairment of the immune system. Without the initiation of antifungal therapy, the acute 
mortality rate has been shown to exceed 85%. Despite the use of mold-active antifungal prophylaxis, 
breakthrough infections caused by Aspergillus species remain a serious threat in the 
immunocompromised population. Breakthrough IA is difficult to diagnose due to low sensitivities of 
mycological tests for IA. Nonetheless, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antifungal treatment is 
the most important predictive factor for a successful outcome in immunocompromised individuals. 
A meta-analysis conducted by the MAH of all-cause mortality in patients with IA, after 6 weeks of 
antifungal treatment, estimated a mortality rate of 23% based on historical data of 3 prospective 
comparative trials of voriconazole (VOR) given for IA treatment. In 2015, a prospective clinical study 
of isavuconazole (ISA) vs VOR in patients with IA reported Day 42 (Week 6) all-cause mortality rates 
of 18.6% and 20.2% in the ISA and VOR treatment arms, respectively. In the same clinical study, a 
successful clinical response at the end of therapy was noted to be 35.0% (ISA) and 38.9% (VOR). 
Management 
Current guidelines for the primary treatment of IA recommend early initiation of antifungal therapy 
while definitive diagnostic evaluation is in progress. Only 2 medications, the triazoles VOR and ISA, 
have been approved for the primary treatment of IA in the past 20 years (initial approvals in 2002 and 
2015, respectively). Recent guidelines (ECIL-6, 2017, ESCMID 2017, IDSA 2016) recommend VOR 
and/or ISA for the primary treatment of IA, with liposomal amphotericin B being the first alternative 
and POS, as well as echinocandins, mainly recommended for salvage treatment. 
VOR is efficacious but has significant safety concerns that limit its clinical use. These include adverse 
effects that are more pronounced than observed with other triazoles (i.e., transient visual 
disturbances, skin rash, erythroderma, photosensitivity, perioral excoriations, visual or auditory 
hallucinations, and cardiovascular events including tachyarrhythmias). Higher VOR plasma 
concentrations are associated with higher rates of visual disturbances and hepatic toxicity. Additionally, 
VOR is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C19, which exhibits genetic 
polymorphism and can result in marked variability in the PK of VOR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 6/90 
 
 
 
 
ISA has also been approved and recommended for the treatment of IA since 2015. Safety information 
for the use of ISA post approval is limited. Adverse effects that may limit ISA use include shortening of 
the QT interval, hepatic toxicity, and anemia. Infusion reactions including hypotension, dyspnea, chills, 
dizziness, and paresthesias have been reported during infusion and may require discontinuation of the 
infusion. ISA product labeling cautions against coadministration of ISA with CYP3A4/5 inducers such as 
aprepitant, prednisone, and pioglitazone, as these may result in mild to moderate decreases of ISA 
plasma levels, thereby reducing its efficacy. 
Given the noted limitations of VOR and ISA and the high underlying mortality of IA, a need exists for 
additional therapies that can overcome the limitations of currently approved IA therapies while 
providing at least similar levels of efficacy in the primary treatment setting. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
POS is a broad-spectrum antifungal compound in the triazole class and blocks the synthesis of 
ergosterol, a key component of the fungal membrane, through inhibition of lanosterol 14α–
demethylase (CYP51). The antifungal activity of POS against clinically relevant molds includes most 
strains of Aspergillus, as well as other mold fungal pathogens such as the Zygomycetes (e.g., species 
of Absidia, Mucor, Rhizopus, and Rhizomucor). 
POS is currently available as oral suspension, tablets and solution for injection formulations, and 
indicated only in adults. Of note, a paediatric extension for children between 2 to 18 years old, with a 
new formulation (Noxafil gastro-resistant powder and solvent for oral suspension), is ongoing in 
parallel of this procedure. 
Currently, POS (oral suspension, tablets and solution for injection) is indicated in EU notably for the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or 
itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products. With this application, an 
indication for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, whatever the line of treatment, is being proposed 
for the tablets and solution for injection formulations. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program for the treatment of IA consisted of a single Phase 3, multicenter, 
randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study of the efficacy and safety of POS versus VOR for 
the treatment of IA in adults and adolescents (P069). The pivotal P069 study was designed to support 
the use of POS IV and POS tablet for the primary treatment of IA and to fulfil post-marketing 
commitments to the CHMP. An open-label Phase 3 study of POS versus VOR in the treatment of deep-
seated fungal infection was also conducted at multiple sites in Japan, and used as the basis for 
licensure in Japan; data from that study are not included in this application with the exception of the 
population PK analysis. 
During the clinical development program of POS for primary treatment of IA, discussions were held 
with the US and EU health authorities with regard to study design, dose selection, and data endpoints 
for study P069. The dosing regimens of POS IV and tablet that were approved for prophylaxis and 
salvage treatment of IFI (salvage treatment approved in the EU) were selected for evaluation. 
Consistent with regulatory guidance, POS was compared with the approved dosing regimens of VOR IV 
and oral formulations, which are the standard of care for the treatment of IA. A single study with a 
double-dummy design was considered acceptable. While study P069 was ongoing, additional regulatory 
guidance was sought in 2016 in order to switch the original primary study endpoint of global clinical 
response at Week 6 in the FAS population, based on a non-inferiority margin of 15%, with the key 
Assessment report

Page 7/90 
 
 
 
 
secondary endpoint of all-cause mortality through Day 42 in the ITT population. Following regulatory 
discussions with the EMA and the FDA, a non-inferiority study design using a 10% non-inferiority 
margin for the proposed primary endpoint (all-cause mortality through Day 42 in the ITT population) 
was considered acceptable by the FDA. In the EU, despite global clinical response being preferred as 
the primary endpoint, the new proposed primary endpoint was also considered acceptable provided 
that the original primary endpoint (global clinical response at Week 6 in the FAS population) was also 
achieved. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The MAH confirmed that study P069 was conducted in accordance with GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
The EPAR table should be updated as this extension application contains new environmental data.

e The majority of patients with oropharayngeal candidiasis will be treated with and respond to topical antifungals.  
Patients who are  
immunosuppressed are more likely to require treatment with a systemic antifungal such as an azole (including 
possible use of  
posaconazole) [25] [26]. 
f This is based on estimated 2 million and 1.3 million global incidence of oral candidiasis and oesophageal 
candidiasis and prorated to  
EU28 2020, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tabular overview of clinical studies:  
This extension of indication of posaconazole (POS) in the first-line treatment of invasive aspergillosis 
(IA) is based on a Phase 3 non-inferiority study. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.2.1.  Introduction 
Posaconazole (POS, MK-5992, NOXAFIL) is a broad spectrum systemic triazole antifungal that inhibits 
lanosterol 14 α-demethylase (also known as CYP51), an enzyme essential for the biosynthesis of 
ergosterol comprising the cell membrane microorganisms. 
The currently marketed formulations of POS are an OS (oral suspension), an IV and an oral delayed-
release tablet (also as referred to as a gastro-resistant tablet, hereafter referred as tablet). 
POS IV solution and tablet are currently approved for use as prophylaxis and salvage treatment (in 
some regions) of IFI including IA in adults with a dosing regimen of 300 mg QD (BID the first day). 
The POS tablet is supplied at a dosage strength of 100 mg and the IV formulation as a solution 
containing 300 mg POS per 16.7 mL solution (18 mg/mL). 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 10/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The key PK properties obtained from adults’ data are briefly summarized below: 
• 
POS tablets are absorbed with a median Tmax of 4 to 5 hours and exhibit dose proportional 
PK after single and multiple dosing up to 300 mg. F is 54%. 
• 
POS has a distribution volume of 261 L, indicating extravascular distribution and is highly 
protein bound (> 98%). 
• 
POS primarily circulates as the parent compound in plasma and does not have any major 
circulating metabolites. Of the circulating metabolites, the majority are glucuronide conjugates 
of POS with only minor amounts of oxidative (CYP40 mediated) metabolites. POS is primarily 
metabolized via UDP glucuronidation and is a substrate of P-gp efflux. 
• 
POS after administration of 300 mg POS IV is slowly eliminated with a mean half-life of 27 
hours and CL of 7.3 L/h. Following tablet administration, POS is eliminated with mean half-life 
of 26 to 31 hours and CL of 7.5 to 11 L/h. Steady-state is reached by Day 6 for both 
formulations. 
According to these past approvals, a wealth of PK information of POS in adults is available. Hence PK 
properties are considered as well known in adults. Consequently, this assessment report will focus on 
specific and relevant PK (and PD aspects) in association with the current submission: extension of the 
indications of POS IV and tablet for use in the primary treatment of IA. 
The POS clinical development program for primary treatment of IA consists of a pivotal Phase 3 study 
(Study P069) where both formulations were investigated in patients aged ≥ 13 years with IA. 
A summary of the PK profile of POS following both formulation in the intended population is presented 
thereafter. In addition, a population PK analysis (PPK) was performed to characterize POS PK in 
subjects being treated for IA. 
2.3.2.2.  Methods 
•  Analytical methods  
A HPLC/MS/MS assay procedure was used to quantify POS plasma concentration and was validated 
by PPD® (Middleton, WI and Richmond, VA). The plasma assay isolated POS and its internal 
standard from plasma using solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatographic separations. 
This assay was used to support the clinical study P069. The analytical range from 5 to 5000 ng/mL 
as presented in Table 1 below.

In addition, plasma VOR (voriconazole) were determined using an HPLC/MS/MS assay procedure, 
validated at Syneos Health Clinic Inc (Quebec). The analytical range for VOR was 5 to 200 ng/mL  
• 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis  
No NCA analysis were performed since only trough PK samples (Cmin or Ctrough) per subjects were 
available. 
POS PK data following both IV and tablet formulation from study P069 and all available clinical studies 
where these formulations were administered (Healthy volunteers or Prophylaxis) were pooled to 
develop a PPK model using NONMEM, version 7.2 (Globomax, 7250 Parkway Drive, Suite 430, 
Hanover, MD 21076 USA). The applied estimation method was FOCE with an additive model for RUV on 
log-transformed data. From this analysis predicted PK metrics (Cavg and Cmin) were derived. 
Exploratory ER analysis (efficacy and safety) have been also performed.

Absolute bioavailability 
Based on the prescribing information (PI) of the tablet formulation an absolute bioavailability of 54% is 
reported (PI US 056Q9W, Revised 3/2019). 
Based on the final parameter estimates from the PopPK analysis (please refer to section 5.3.2.8), the 
absolute bioavailability for the tablet formulation has been estimated at 82% (95% CI: 79-85).

Food effect 
Based on the prescribing information of the tablet formulation, the food effect as a fed/fasted GMR 
(90% CI) was 1.51 (1.33-1.72) for AUCinf based on a single-dose comparisons in Phase 1 studies. 
Study P069 (Descriptive statistics) 
Food effect was also investigated during study P069 on a subset of 179 patients with IA. Comparison 
of mean trough plasma concentrations across subjects who received POS with a meal of any type 
compared to fasting subjects showed an overall modestly higher exposure, from 15% at week 1 to 
approximately 33% to 39% from weeks 2 to through 12 (Table 2). There was no discernible trend in 
POS exposure with the type of meal consumed (light, medium, heavy) in subjects who took POS with a 
meal. The trend towards higher POS trough plasma concentrations when POS tablets were 
administered with a meal versus fasting, regardless of meal type, is evident from both Week 1 data 
(where subjects received tablet only) and data pooled across Weeks 2 through 12 (where subjects may 
have been switched from IV solution to tablet). These results demonstrate administration of POS tablet 
with a meal had a moderate effect (15% to 39%) on POS trough plasma concentrations.

receiving POS tablet 200 mg QD 
All Studies (PPK analysis and simulations) 
Based on the final parameter estimates from the PPK analysis (please refer to section 5.3.2.8), food 
was found to increase by 20% (95% CI: 16-23) POS F1, indicating that POS tablet administered with 
food (given the estimated F of 82%) is close to being completely bioavailable.  
Following simulations, POS exposure parameters (Cmin and Cavg) comparing IV and oral 
administration in fasted and fed conditions for each disease status are shown in the Figure below. 
Similar distribution of Cavg in fed state vs IV is observed for all disease status. Also, Cavg in IA 
patients are slightly increased compared to subject in prophylaxis (effect of the disease status on CL).

subject Cavg were particularly increased compared to global or Japanese subjects as shown in Figure 
2.

Figure 2: Boxplot of predicted Day 42 Cavg and Cmin according to ethnicity, disease status, formulation 
and fast/fed conditions 
The CHMP noted that administration of food increased Cmin by 15% at week 1 and by 33 to 39% from 
week 2 to 12. Overall mean Cmin in fast and fed states ranged from 1411 to 1691 ng/mL and 1625 to 
2169 ng/mL, respectively, in IA patients. 
Following the PPK analysis, food effect was found to increase by 19.5% POS F1, however given the 
high eta-shrinkage of F1, the magnitude of the food effect on F1 should be viewed with caution. This is 
particularly highlighted in the Figure  where both simulated Cmin and Cavg following administration of 
tablet in the fed state approximately equal Cmin and Cavg following IV infusion suggesting (as stated 
by the MAH), that POS tablet administered with food is close to being completely bioavailable (bearing 
in mind an estimated F1 of 82%). 
Indeed, based on formal clinical studies in HV absolute bioavailability has been estimated at 54% (here 
82%) and food effect was associated to a 50% increase of AUCinf. 
The CHMP considered that the recommendation that tablets may be taken with or without food as 
already stated in the SmPC is supported.

The current Type II variation of extension of the indications of POS in adult patients with IA  includes 
one PPK analysis. This analysis was performed following the results from Study P069. 
Study P069 
Design 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, double-dummy study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of POS vs voriconazole (VOR) in subject’s ≥ 13 years with proven, probable, or possible IA. Study 
treatments are outlined in Table 3. 
Table 3: Treatment arms and study treatments for P069 
Subjects were allowed to begin treatment with the IV formulation then step/down transition to oral 
therapy or to begin with oral therapy. The duration of treatment was 84 days with a maximal duration 
of 96 days. 
Rationale of the POS dosing regimen 
The dosing regimen selected for P069, POS 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1) IV solution or tablet, is the 
same as the dosing regimen approved for prophylaxis and salvage treatment (in some regions) of IFI. 
This past–approval was based on a PK bridging strategy which was designed in consultation with the 
FDA and EMA supporting extrapolation of the indications supported by OS to tablet and IV. In these 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 16/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bridging studies, the predefined exposure target (≥ 90% of subjects achieving 500 ng/mL) was met 
following administration of either tablet or IV solution with acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. 
PK sampling 
POS and VOR plasma concentration were to be determined in all subjects prior to the first dose of 
study treatment and pre-dose on week 1, 2, 4, 6, 12/EOT. 
For adult subjects in IV therapy, at week 1, an additional POS plasma concentration at the end of the 
infusion was performed (Cmax) 
For adolescents in IV therapy, Cmax were determined in Week 1, 2, 4, 6, 12/EOT.  
Results 
The overall POS PK population analysis in P069 consisted of 264 subjects (of 288 in the ITT population) 
who had ≥ 1 reported plasma concentration at any time point during the treatment period. PK data 
were further used for the PPK analysis. A limited number (N=3) of adolescents received POS in P069 
and there is insufficient data to support any conclusion regarding POS plasma concentration in this age 
group. 
Mean POS trough plasma concentrations, pooled across both IV and oral routes of administration, 
appear to have been approaching SS by the end of week 1. GM trough POS concentration was 
approximately 1500 ng/mL at all time points through to Week 12 as show in Figure 3 and Table 4.

Population Pharmacokinetic analysis 
Model development 
The analysis was conducted using all available PK data from clinical trial where POS was administered 
as IV or tablet formulations. The concentration-time data for POS were modelled using a 
compartmental approach. Log transform PK data was considered.  
Pre-dose POS concentration above the LOQ were excluded. All PK observations which were not 
associated with a dosing event, were regarded as unevaluable and therefore excluded. BLQ were 
excluded from the analysis, however in case of the proportion was larger than 5%, the impact of this 
exclusion approach was investigated by exploring alternative methods to account for these missing 
data. In addition, a search for outliers as abs CWRES >6 was also performed and effects of these PK 
outliers were evaluated. 
Food, age, body weight, CRCL, sex, disease state (categorized as healthy subjects/prophylaxis of 
IFI/treatment IA/Other Disease), race and regional ethnicity were assessed as potential covariates for 
POS pharmacokinetic model parameters. Of these covariates, the impact of race, regional ethnicity and 
disease state was assessed according different levels for each parameter of interest, in order to 
prevent identification of these covariates as proxy for any confounded but more mechanistic covariates 
such as age and CRCL. 
The PopPK model was built using nonlinear mixed effects model with the first order conditional 
estimation method (FOCE) in Nonmem (version 7.4.3, Globomax, 7250 Parkway Drive, Suite 430, 
Hanover, MD 21076 USA).  
Covariates selection was performed using a stepwise/backward procedure. Then the PopPK model was 
checked using standard goodness-of-fit (GOF) and evaluated using a pcVPC. Finally, a bootstrap 
analysis was performed. 
Then the final PPK model was used to predict the distribution of POS exposure in all subjects included 
in the analysis on order to derive the POS summary statistics of Cavg and Cmin. Three scenarios have 
been investigated and Cavg and Cmin were computed accordingly: 
• 
Tablet/fast following 300 mg BID (Day 1), then 300 mg QD up to Day 42, Cavg and Cmin at Day 
42 
• 
• 
Tablet/fed following 300 mg BID (Day 1), then 300 mg QD up to Day 42, Cavg and Cmin at Day 42 
IV formulation following 300 mg BID (Day 1), then 300 mg QD up to Day 42, Cavg and Cmin at 
Day 42 
The goals of this analysis was to assess a) the distribution of POS exposures of subjects according their 
disease status, regional ethnicity, food status, b) the impact of age and BW on the PK exposure

metrics and c) to evaluate the distribution of POS exposures in a Japanese regional treatment of IA 
patient population. 
Results 
The analysis dataset included 1092 subjects with a total observations of 11466 evaluable PK samples 
as presented in Table 5. 
A total of 1400 concentrations were not included in the analysis because they were BLQ. Among them 
818 reflected a pre-dose sample collected before the first administration and 582 reflected a sample 
after the first dose of administration (4.8% of the total of observations).

A  higher  proportion  of  male  subjects  is  included  in  the  analysis  (60%  versus  40%).  Comparable 
proportions  of  male  and  female  subjects  were  observed  in  the  Prophylaxis  of  IFI  and  Treatment-IA 
populations whereas male subjects represented more than 2/3 of the population of Healthy subjects and 
more than 90% of the population in Treatment-Other Disease patients. White and Asian subjects (62% 
versus 29%) represented nearly all of the subjects. Chinese and Japanese regional subjects represented 
17% and 10% of the population, respectively. Patients treated in prophylaxis of IFI reflected the majority 
of the analysis population (55%) whereas patient for IA represented 25%.

Key steps of the base PK structural model building are provided in  Table 7. Base structural PK model 
consisted of a 2 compartment PK model with sequential zero and first-order absorption model and linear 
elimination parameterized by Ka, CL, Vc, Q, Vd, D1 and F1. BW allometric scaling was considered with 
estimated exponents. IIV was estimated on all PK parameters except Q. 
All model parameters were well estimated, with RSE% values < 13% for the fixed effect parameters and 
<20%  for  the  random  effect  parameters.  Estimates  of  the  shrinkage  for  the  different  parameters 
suggested that the individual estimates for CL were reasonably robust (shrinkage 14%), whereas the 
individual  estimates  of  the  Vc,  Vp,  bioavailability  (F1)  and  absorption  parameters  (KA  and  D1)  were 
subject to shrinkage and were therefore less reliable (shrinkage values varying from 42% up to 63%). 
This  implies  that  evaluations  of  individual  post-hoc  estimates  for  these  parameters,  for  example  in 
relation to covariates, should be interpreted with caution. 
Table 7: Summary of key models for the structural model 
An  SCM  covariate  analysis  was  performed  with  the  covariates  as  defined  in  Table  8  below.  Following 
covariates selection, IOV was investigated on Ka, F1 and D1, however no IOV was retained.

Food effect was found to have an effect on F1 with an increase of 19.5% in fed conditions suggesting 
that tablet administration with food results in similar PK levels to IV. 
An exponential effect of age on CL was found resulting in an approximately 10% and 5% decrease in 
CL (corresponding to an 11% and 5% decrease in Cavg) for an 80- year old subject as compared to 
the median 51-year-old or a 65-year old subject, respectively. 
The exponential effect of weight on CL caused a 33% increase for a 120-kg subject (corresponding to a 
25% decrease in Cavg) and a 16% decrease for a 50-kg subject (corresponding to a 19% increase in 
Cavg) compared to the median 70 kg subject.  
The disease status effect on CL in the subpopulation treated for IA and Other Disease was predicted 
with an 11% and 44% reduction (corresponding to 12% and 79% increase in Cavg), respectively. 
Decreases of 20% and 54% were found in Vc and Vp, respectively, in healthy subjects as compared to 
the general study population. Healthy subjects also showed a 63% higher D1. 
Finally, it was identified that CL in the Chinese regional subjects in the study population was 25% 
lower (corresponding to a 33% increase in Cavg) compared to the general population. 
Standard GOF are provided in Figure 4 and pcVPC in Figure 5. In the IA subpopulation, N=4 
concentrations were quantifiable more than 300 h after the last administration driving the trend 
observed in the plot whereas those concentrations appeared to be more consistent with those obtained 
before 100 hours. Altogether these plots provide further confirmation that the final model adequately 
described the observed concentrations and can be used prospectively for predictive purposes.

PPK model 
The CHMP noted that the PPK model presented by the MAH was based on PK data from N=1092 
subjects from which n=11457 PK samples were available. PK data were retrieved from 13 clinical 
studies where POS was administered as IV or tablet formulation. Whereas PK data from patients with 
IA represent 290 patients with 1098 PK samples, the proposed analysis is only descriptive and 
supportive. Nevertheless, for the entire population, results from this analysis (and mainly the 
simulation exercise) were highlighted in the special populations section in the SmPC. 
The PPK model consisted of a 2 cpt PK model parameterized in terms of D1, F1, CL, Q, Vc, Vp and ka. 
BW allometric scaling with estimated exponents (0.531 for CL and Q, 1.41 for Vc and Vp) were 
considered. All PK parameters were estimated with a good precision (RSE<30% for both fixed and 
random effects). CL was estimated at 6.8 L/h and F1 at 0.812. IIV was particularly high for F1 and Vc 
(< 100%). Eta-shrinkage is acceptable for CL only (<15%), whereas for other PK parameters 
shrinkage range from 40.3 to 63.7%. Therefore, any output for the covariate screening procedure 
investigation on these parameters should be interpreted with cautions (Food effect on F1, healthy 
volunteer status on Vc, Vp and D1). IA or other disease status, age and race were found to have an 
effect on POS CL. 
GOF does not show a particular bias and pcVPC shows good predictive performance (except for the IA 
population at later time points). Overall, the PPK analysis was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Simulation 
Based on the final population PK model, a series of model predictions was performed for all subjects 
(N=1092) after IV or oral administration (fasted and fed conditions) of a dose regimen of 300 mg of 
POS BID at Day 1 and QD up to Day 42 (last day of dosing in P069). 
A full PK profile was predicted with the individual POP PK parameters for all subjects in the current 
analysis in order to calculate the individual exposure parameters Cavg, Cmin. Then, the predictions 
were compared to explore the impact of food effect by comparing all subjects in fasted and fed 
conditions, and then per subpopulation of interest, disease status and regional ethnicity levels.  
In addition, the effect of weight with three level of stratification (<71 kg and over 71 kg; < 29 kg, 29-
<69 kg and over 69 kg; and a band every 10 kg from < 50 and up to ≥ 120 kg). Similarly, the effect 
of age was also explored with four level of stratification (< 65 y, 65-<75 years and over 75 years; <29 
years, 29-<69 years and over 69 years; and a band every 10 years from < 20 years and up to ≥ 80 
kg). 
Finally, the effect of race (Japanese) was also explored. In order to support the use of POS in Japanese 
subjects with IA, simulations were performed to create a virtual Japanese IA population. For the 
purpose of simulations and in order to apply a distribution of age and weight that would optimally 
reflect a true patient population, the distribution of individual age/weight combinations was obtained 
from the Global+Chinese regional patients in the current analysis (N=264). 
A scaling of age and weight distributions was performed, based on published literature in Japanese IA 
subjects, to obtain a Japanese IA population. For the scaling, the mean age applied was 55.5 years, 
comparable to that in Global+Chinese regional IA (53.3 years) and mean weight of 56.5 kg, lower than 
the mean observed in the Global+Chinese regional IA (68.3 kg). 
Therefore, results from three sets of simulation (Table 10) are presented thereafter.

Results of the different scenarios with age, weight and race will be presented in the Section  Special

2.3.2.9.  Special Populations 
• 
Gender 
Results from the PPK analysis indicated that gender was not a significant covariate of any of the 
available PK parameters.

• 
Race 
The PK dataset consisted of 62% of White, 29% of Asian, 17% of Chinese and 10% of Japanese 
subjects. 
Results from the PPK analysis indicated that Chinese status has a significant effect on POS CL. POS 
clearance in subjects enrolled in clinical studies in China was decreased 25% (corresponding to a 33% 
increase in Cavg) compared to the global population (ex-China) when all other covariates are held 
constant. There was no significant effect of race or Japanese regional ethnicity when Chinese regional 
ethnicity was included in the model. 
Figure 2 (section food effect) presents the distribution of the model predicted steady-state POS Cavg in 
Chinese, Japanese and other races. 
Overall the effect of Chinese race is not considered to be clinically meaningful. 
Japanese IA population 
Based on a simulation exercise, a slight increase of both exposure parameters was observed for 
Japanese-IA patients in the three scenarios as shown in  
Table 11, presumably due to the influence of weight which appears to be slightly lower based upon the 
virtual population. 
Table 11: Summary statistics of model simulated Day 42 Cavg and Cmin between Virtual Japanese IA 
patients and others following IV or oral administration, in fed/fast state 
The CHMP noted that Chinese race was found to have a significant effect on POS CL (increase of Cavg 
by 33%). However, the effect does not appear to be clinically meaningful. 
• 
Weight 
Results from the PPK analysis indicated that weight have a significant effect on POS PK parameters, as 
BW allometric scaling was considered using estimated allometric exponents. 
Following a simulation exercise, after administration of tablet under fast conditions, POS exposure 
parameters taking account for weight level stratification is presented in Figure 6 and summary

statistics in Table 12. The model prediction results show that subjects with a lower body weight have 
higher exposures. Subjects with a body weight higher than 80kg generally have overlapping 
distributions of Cmin and Cavg whereas below 80kg, the distributions of Cmin and Cavg are shifted 
higher with decreasing bodyweight, particularly for subjects with bodyweight <50kg.

In fed state similar trends were observed and are presented in Table 13 below.

Table 14: Summary statistics of predicted Day 42 Cavg and Cmin for all subjects according to Weight 
bands following administration of the IV formulation 
The CHMP noted that subjects with low body weight < 50 kg or high bodyweight ≥ 120 kg have 
increased POS Cavg by 19% and decreased POS Cavg by 25% respectively, when all PK parameters 
from the PPK model are held constant. 
Median Cavg or Cmin following administration of tablet under fed/fast state or the IV formulation, 
remain in all the situations above 500 ng/mL. 
The Committee considered that for tablet/fed vs IV, Cavg appears similar. 
• 
Elderly 
Results from the PopPK analysis indicated that age was a significant covariate on CL.

The CHMP considered that age was found to have a significant effect on POS CL. Median Cavg 
approximately increased by 13.8% from 1880 ng/mL (20-<30 years) to 2140 ng/mL (70-< 80 years).  
Elderly subjects (≥ 80 years) have an increased POS Cavg by 11% compared to a typical subject of 50 
years, when all PK parameters from the PPK model are held constant. 
However, based on the simulation exercise when administered POS tablet under fast /fed conditions or 
following the IV formulation, it is predicted that more than 50% (tablet fast, median Cavg of 2640 
ng/mL) and 75% of the subjects (tablet fed and IV with Q1 of 2510 and 2570 ng/mL) have a Cavg 
above 2500 ng/mL, a threshold which have been used previously for PK bridging studies (from OS to 
IV and tablet). In the SmPC, it is recommended to closely monitor the older patients (> 80 years old) 
for adverse events, which was agreed by the Committee. 
• 
Children 
Only five adolescents aged 14-17 years were enrolled in study P069 and treated with either formulation 
(three of whom in the POS arm). 
The CHMP noted that just five adolescent patients were included in Study P069. The MAH statement “A 
limited number (N=3) of adolescents received POS in P069 and there is insufficient data to support any 
conclusion regarding POS plasma concentration in this age group” was agreed to by the Committee. 
With this procedure, the IA indication is claimed for adults only, which is supported by the Committee. 
• 
Disease status 
The effect of disease status was more formally assessed in the population PK analysis and was identified 
as having a significant effect on clearance. The effect was estimated to result in an 11% reduction in 
clearance  (corresponding  to  a  12%  increase  in  Cavg)  in  the  subpopulation  treated  for  IA  and  a  44% 
reduction in clearance (corresponding to a 79% increase in Cavg) in the subpopulation being treated for 
fungal diseases other than IA compared to healthy subjects. 
The effect of disease status is illustrated by the distribution of model-predicted steady-state Cavg and 
Cmin for administration of POS IV solution and tablet (fed and fasted) at the recommended dose of 300 
mg QD (BID on Day 1) across all subjects included in the population PK analysis. The results show that 
the  distributions  of  Cavg  in  the  prophylaxis  and  IA  treatment  groups  were  comparable  and  largely 
overlapping,  although  there  was  more  variability  in  the  IA  treatment  group.  Both  groups  had  higher 
exposure  compared  to  the  healthy  group  although  again  the  distributions  were  largely  overlapping 
consistent with the small difference in clearance between these groups identified by the model.

The CHMP noted that, in general, median Cavg is similar between the IA and the prophylactic 
treatment groups, and both have Cavg greater than HV.

Microbiological data 
In vitro microbiology activity against isolates from study P069 
A total of 127 fungal isolates from study P069 were sent to the reference lab. Among them, 119 were 
identified as Aspergillus spp. (A. fumigatus [n=76], A. flavus species complex [n=19], A. section Nigri 
[n=10], A. section Terrei [n=7]; and 7 isolates were Aspergillus spp not further identified). There were 
also 5 other mold organisms and 3 Candida spp. In vitro susceptibility testing was performed by both 
CLSI microbroth dilution and EUCAST microbroth dilution methodology.

Overall, POS (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L, range 0.12-8 mg/L) displayed similar activity to VOR (MIC50/90, 
0.5/1 mg/L, range 0.12-4 mg/L) against these 119 Aspergillus spp. isolates. POS and VOR inhibited 
99.2% and 95.8% of Aspergillus spp. isolates, respectively: 
- A. fumigatus: POS (MIC50/90, 0.5/0.5 mg/L, range 0.12-1 mg/L) and VOR (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 
mg/L, range 0.12-1 mg/L) inhibited all 76 isolates at MIC of 1 mg/L. By EUCAST methodology and 
susceptibility interpretation criteria, POS 93.4% of the isolates (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/L, range 
0.03-0.25 mg/L) and VOR inhibited 94.7% of isolates (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L, range 0.12-2 mg/L). 
- A. flavus: among 19 isolates recovered from this study, POS (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mg/L, range 0.25-1 
mg/L) and VOR (MIC50/90, 1/1 mg/L, range 0.5-1 mg/L) displayed equivalent activity. Three of 19 
isolates (15.8%) were characterized as non-wildtype to POS (MICs, 1 mg/L). 
- A. section Nigri: similar activity for POS (MIC50/90, 1/1 mg/L, range 0.5-1 mg/L) and VOR 
(MIC50/90, 1/1 mg/L, range 0.5-1 mg/L) was observed against 10 isolates. Seven isolates were 
recovered in this study. All displayed WT phenotypes against the antifungal agents tested.  
- A. section Terrei: POS (MIC50, 0.5 mg/L) and VOR (MIC50, 0.5 mg/L) inhibited all isolates at MIC of 
0.5 mg/L. 
- POS (MIC range, 0.5-1 mg/L) showed similar activity to VOR (MIC range, 0.5-2 mg/L) against other 
Aspergillus spp., including A. lentulus (n=4), A. nidulans species complex (1) and A. sydowii (1). POS 
and VOR displayed high MIC values (VOR MIC, 4 mg/L; POS MIC, >8 mg/L) against 1 A. ustus spp. 
complex isolate. 
Five rarely recovered molds were observed in P069 and included the following organisms: Fusarium 
incarnatum-equiseti species complex (n=1), Mucor circinelloides (1), Rhizomucor pusillus (1), Rhizopus 
oryzae (1), Lasiodiplodia spp. (1). POS showed activity against 1 Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species 
complex (MIC, 2 mg/L), and the 3 Mucorales isolates (MIC range, 0.5-2 mg/L). Limited activity was 
observed by POS against 1 Lasiodiplodia spp. isolate. 
Efficacy endpoints were not analyzed by the type of fungal species isolated or by the MIC as only 24% 
of subjects overall (140/575) had fungal culture results reported, and the most commonly reported 
species (A. fumigatus) was identified in only 12.3% (71/575) of subjects. Of those subjects infected 
with A. fumigatus, too few had susceptibility data to evaluate clinical response by MIC value. 
The CHMP noted that, overall, the in vitro susceptibility of these fungal agents (mainly A. fumigatus) to 
the study drug is similar between POS and VOR groups. However, the clinical consequences of these in 
vitro susceptibilities were not assessed. Considering the proposed indication in first-line IA, similarly 
than VOR, these microbiological data are reassuring, but the Committee considered that a higher 
efficacy of POS on VOR-resistant strains is not expected. 
In vitro microbiology activity against Aspergillus and rare mold isolates from 
surveillance studies 
Two surveillance study of POS in vitro activities against filamentous fungi were performed:  
-  One from 2010 to 2018 with 2,554 isolates of filamentous fungi (2,100 Aspergillus spp. and 
454 non-Aspergillus molds) with VOR, ITR, caspofungin, anidulafungin, micafungin, and 
amphotericin B as comparator agents (Pfaller MA, Castanheira M. Activity of Posaconazole and 
Comparator Antifungal Agents Tested Against Filamentous Fungi. JMI Laboratories, Feb 2020).  
-  One in 2018 with 397 isolates of filamentous fungi (325 Aspergillus spp. and 72 non-
Aspergillus molds) using the same comparators plus ISA (Carvalhaes C. Activity of 
Posaconazole and Comparator Antifungal Agents Tested Against Filamentous Fungi collected in 
2018. JMI Laboratories, Apr 2020). 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021

In the first study, germs were isolated from patients at 75 medical centers in North America (52.2%, 
Europe (29.6%), the Asia-Pacific (12.5%) region, and Latin America (5.7%).  
The most common Aspergillus species was A. fumigatus (1,483 isolates). For A. fumigatus, MIC90 of 
posaconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole were 0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. 
The MIC90 for POS was ≤ 1 mg/L for Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus section Flavi, Aspergillus 
section Nidulantes, Aspergillus section Nigri, Aspergillus section Terrei and Aspergillus section 
Versicolor. VOR and ITR had similar in vitro activity against these species.  
All three azoles were less active in vitro (MIC90: >8 mg/L) vs Aspergillus section Usti. 
In Europe, the frequency of non-wild type (NWT) strains of A. fumigatus increased steadily from 2010 
to 2018 for POS (0.2 to 4.5%). 
In the second study, the distribution of isolates according to the geographical regions was similar to 
the isolate distribution in the 2010-2018 surveillance report. The most common Aspergillus species 
was A. fumigatus (220 isolates). POS, VOR, ISA, and ITR had similar in vitro activities against the 266 
Aspergillus isolates (POS, ISA, ITR and VOR MIC90 0.5, 1, 2, and 1 mg/L, respectively). 
In conclusion, about these two studies:  
POS has comparable activity to VOR, ISA, and ITR against Aspergillus spp. 
POS was more active in vitro than: 
• VOR, ISA, or ITR against Mucorales group 
• VOR or ITR against Rhizopus oryzae 
• ITR or ISA against Scedosporium apiospermum/Scedosporium boydii 
The CHMP considered that these surveillance data are consistent with the known in vitro activity of 
azole antifungals and the activity of POS against isolates from study P069.   
NWT strains of A. fumigatus have increased in Europe during the period 2010-2018 study, steadily and 
similarly for ITR (0% to 7%), VOR (0% to 4.5%) and POS (1.5% to 4.5%). Of note, there was no 
consistent trend for an increased frequency of NWT strains in the other geographic areas (North 
America, Asia-Pacific and Latin America).  
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exploratory ER (efficacy and safety) analyses were performed for IA based on PK/PD data retrieve 
from Study P069. The relationship between key efficacy and safety endpoints and POS exposures in 
P069 was explored by allocating subjects into quartiles based on trough plasma concentration. 
ER-efficacy 
For all-case mortality through Day 42 vs quartile of Ctrough, no particular trend is observed as shown 
in Figure 8. Similarly, no trend was observed in clinical response for Week 6 FAS vs Ctrough as shown 
in Figure 9.

ER-safety 
Exposure-safety relationships of POS by quartile of exposure were evaluated for drug-related AEs and 
for all AEs. No difference in incidence for all AEs was observed among the quartiles of exposure and no 
difference in incidence was observed for the majority of the most commonly reported AEs (those 
reported by ≥10% of subjects) or for SOCs. Among subjects with available trough plasma POS

Page 38/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations, there was a trend toward a higher incidence of drug-related AEs in the highest quartile 
of POS exposure relative to lower exposure quartiles 1 or 2. Specifically, a higher incidence of drug 
related ALT increased, nausea, and vomiting were noted with higher POS exposures relative to lower 
trough plasma concentrations. While there is a trend of a higher incidence of drug related AEs in 
quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 or 2, it is modest and its non-monotonic increase with exposures is 
not suggestive of a strong PK relationship. Given the variability between specific AE incidence and 
exposure quartile noted in the P069 exposure-safety analysis and the absence of any exposure-safety 
relationship noted in prior studies of POS IV and tablet (with similar exposure), there is not considered 
to be a relationship between POS exposure and safety. 
Figure 10: Drug related adverse events vs Ctrough quartile following administration of POS IV and tablet 
The CHMP considered that, based on the exploratory ER efficacy analysis in IA patients, no trend 
between Ctrough and efficacy endpoint is obvious, whereas based on the ER safety as long as Ctrough 
is increased (above 2274 ng/mL, Q4 quartile), a trend of higher incidence of drug-related AE is proven. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In support of an extension of the indication of posaconazole (POS) as a first line treatment of adult 
and adolescent IA patients aged ≥ 13 years, a dedicated clinical study (P069) was performed where 
the currently approved IV and tablet formulations were tested following a dosing regimen of 300 mg 
BID (Day 1) and 300 mg QD thereafter already approved for prophylaxis and salvage treatment for 
IFI. A PPK model was developed to characterize the PK of POS IV and tablet across populations, this 
PPK model is considered only descriptive and supportive. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 39/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only 5 adolescent patients were included in Study P069, 3 of which in the POS arm. Therefore, any 
agreement on the extension of indication for subjects ≥ 13 years appears unreasonable. The MAH 
statement “A limited number (N=3) of adolescents received POS in P069 and there is insufficient data 
to support any conclusion regarding POS plasma concentration in this age group” is fully supported. In 
the SmPC, the IA indication is claimed for adults only, which was supported by the CHMP.  
One concern was raised with regards to the need for dose adjustment in the patient aged ≥ 80 years. 
The MAH explained that, based on the PopPK analysis, age was found to have an effect on POS CL with 
a predicted decreased by 10% (increased of Cavg by 11%) in elderly subjects compared to a typical 
subject (when all other covariates are kept constant). However, this result does not reflect what is 
observed presently, since other covariates may increase the observed Cavg in elderly (like BW, which 
is expected to be low). They also explained that such inflated Cavg cannot be solely linked to extreme 
body weight, which was agreed by the Committee. In addition, even if the PK dataset in elderly subject 
is limited, the MAH pointed out that the safety profile remains similar to that of younger subjects.  
Therefore, the MAH proposal to indicate in the SmPC that patients who are >80 years of age are more 
likely to experience higher plasma concentrations of POS and should be closely monitored for adverse 
events was accepted by the CHMP.  
As regards microbiological data, in vitro activity of POS on several strains of Aspergillus is overall 
similar to VOR. Higher efficacy of POS on VOR-resistant strains is not expected. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure to posaconazole in adult patients with IA, receiving the commercial formulations, IV solution 
for infusion or tablet under fed and fast states, at the recommended dosage regimen of 300 mg QD 
(BID on Day 1), has been shown to be similar to that of patient following a prophylactic treatment of 
IFI. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy was evaluated in a single non-inferiority study P069. This study compared Posaconazole 
with Voriconazole which is the reference for IA treatment. Isavuconazole is also indicated in first line 
treatment for IA, supported by a non-inferiority study (study CL-0104). The design of P069 is similar.  
- Study P069 
Methods 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of posaconazole (POS) versus voriconazole (VOR) in 
subjects ≥13 years of age with proven, probable, or possible invasive aspergillosis (IA). The study 
used IV form and tablet form of POS. The all-cause mortality rate through Day 42 was the main 
criteria to assess the non-inferiority with VOR.  
Study participants 
Subjects with proven or probable IA based 2008 EORTC/MSG definitions (see below). Subjects with 
possible IA may also be included.  
Inclusion criteria: 
Patients were male or female from any ethnicity aged 13 years or older, weighing >40 kg to ≤150 kg, 
with proven, probable or possible IA based on the 2008 revised European Organization for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions. Individuals enrolled

with possible IA were to be further evaluated with mycological diagnosis for proven or probable IA 
within 7 days post-randomization. The IA was to have been acute (duration of clinical syndrome <30 
days). Subjects were required to have a central line in place or planned for placement before beginning 
IV therapy. Pregnant women were not enrolled and women in age of giving birth had to use an 
adequate birth control.  
Exclusion criteria:  
The main exclusion criteria were:  
- Chronic (>1 month duration) IA, relapsed/recurrent IA, or refractory IA which has not responded to 
prior antifungal therapy. 
- Sarcoidosis, aspergilloma, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). 
-  Known  mixed  invasive  mold  fungal  infection  including  Zygomycetes,  and/or  a  known  invasive 
Aspergillus fungal infection in which either study drug may not be considered active. 
- Previous antifungal therapy ≥4 days for this infection episode. 
- Current mold-active antifungal prophylaxis. 
- Known hypersensitivity or other serious adverse reaction to any azole antifungal therapy. 
- Known history of Torsade de Pointes, unstable cardiac arrhythmia or proarrhythmic conditions, or a 
history of recent myocardial infarction within 90 days of study entry. 
- QTc interval ≥ 500 msec on electrocardiogram performed at screening or baseline. 
- Significant liver dysfunction, hepatic cirrhosis, severe hepatic impairment. 
- Severe renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance <20 mL/min) or on hemodialysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021

-  Known  hereditary  problem  of  galactose  intolerance,  Lapp  lactase  deficiency,  or  glucose-galactose 
malabsorption. 
- Acute symptomatic pancreatitis (within 6 months of study entry), chronic pancreatitis. 
- Artificial ventilation, subject not expected to survive for at least 1 week post-randomization 
The CHMP noted that study subjects were adults and adolescents with possible, probable or proven 
acute invasive aspergillosis (according to standardized diagnostic criteria). Of note, possible IA will be 
confirmed with an additional diagnostic. In the event that possible IA was not confirmed, the patients 
may continue to be treated if clinician deems appropriate.  
Importantly, subjects should not have history of chronic, recurrent or refractory IA, neither a current 
antifungal prophylaxis, consistent with the first line treatment of IA proposed within this application. 
Subjects may have started an antifungal therapy but no more than 3 days.  
Exclusion criteria are in accordance to the known safety profiles and SmPC of posaconazole and 
voriconazole. 
Treatments 
Intravenous forms and oral forms were evaluated in this study for POS and VOR. Most subjects began 
antifungal azole (VOR or POS) therapy via the IV route; however, some began therapy via the solid 
oral route. Azole therapy was switched from IV route to the solid oral route when the subject is 
considered clinically stable and able to take oral medication. 
Treatment duration was at least 84 days (12 weeks).  
The CHMP noted that the dosing regimen of posaconazole and voriconazole are in accordance with 
their SmPC. Of note, POS was administered as IV or tablet formulations. The oral suspension was not 
used. As the tablet and oral suspension are not equivalent due to differences between these two

formulations (in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration 
achieved), this extension of indications application did not concern the oral suspension formulation. 
Objectives 
Primary: 
To compare all-cause mortality for POS compared to VOR in the first-line treatment of IA through 
Day  42  in  all  randomized  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment  in  the  ITT 
population (all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug) 
Secondary: 
-  To  evaluate  the  all-cause  mortality  for  POS  vs.  VOR  through  Day  42  in  the  FAS  population  (all 
randomized  subjects  who  were  classified  as  having  proven  or  probable  IA  (based  upon  independent 
adjudication assessment), and received at least 1 dose of study drug). 
-  To  evaluate  the  all-cause  mortality  for  POS  vs.  VOR  through  Day  84  in  both  the  FAS  and  ITT 
populations. 
- To evaluate mortality due to IA through Day 42 and Day 84 for POS vs. VOR in the FAS population. 
- To evaluate the time to death (all causes) for POS vs. VOR in the FAS population. 
- To evaluate the global clinical response for POS vs. VOR at Week 6 in the FAS population. 
- To evaluate the global clinical response for POS vs. VOR at Week 12 in the FAS population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
All-cause mortality through Day 42 in the ITT population. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
- All-cause mortality through Day 42 in the FAS population, and through Day 84 in the FAS and ITT 
populations 
- Global clinical response for POS vs. VOR at Week 6 and 12 in the FAS population 
- Time to death (all causes) in the FAS population  
- Mortality due to IA through Day 42 and Day 84 in the FAS population 
The CHMP noted that during study P069, the MAH switched the order of the endpoints, whereby the 
“all-cause mortality” endpoint would become the primary study endpoint, while the “global response 
rate” endpoint would become the secondary study endpoint, in order to be consistent with the design 
of isavuconazole study CL-104, which formed the basis of registration for isavuconazole for the 
treatment of IA in the EU.  
The EMA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/264373/2016) considered that the initially proposed endpoint “global 
response rate” would be preferred and therefore should be maintained and considered as a key 
coprimary endpoint. Therefore, the CHMP considered that, in accordance to the EMA scientific advice, 
both efficacy endpoints (‘all-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population’ and ‘global clinical 
response at 6 week in the FAS population’) had to be considered for the non-inferiority assessment of 
POS vs VOR.

Sample size 
Approximately 400 evaluable subjects (approximately 600 randomized and treated) were planned to 
be enrolled in this study and randomly assigned to receive either POS monotherapy or VOR 
monotherapy. This sample size (200 evaluable FAS (All randomized subjects who were classified as 
having proven or probable IA and who received at least one dose of treatment) subjects in each azole 
monotherapy arm) was estimated to have >85% power (with 1-sided alpha=0.025) to show non-
inferiority of POS monotherapy compared to VOR monotherapy using a 15% margin assuming a 
response rate at 6 weeks of 65% for VOR treated subjects. The response rate for this study was 
assumed to be slightly higher than previously reported for VOR due to both broader inclusion criteria, 
an anticipated higher percentage of subjects 'probable' IA to be enrolled in this study, and earlier 
treatment. 
The CHMP noted that the sample size calculation was performed using the initial primary endpoint 
(global clinical response rate at 6 week). However, this primary endpoint was afterwards switched to 
the primary endpoint “all-cause mortality through day 42”, but the sample size was not re-calculated, 
assuming that the upper bound of the 95% CI on the difference (POS-VOR) in the all-cause mortality 
rates will be compared to 10%, and the pre-specified non-inferiority margin observed response rate for 
POS could only be at most approximately 3 percentage points worse (more) than VOR and still meet 
the upper bound of 10% with the current sample size.  
Both endpoints were to be treated as co-primary endpoints, but the sample size calculation was 
performed using the initial primary endpoint and was not recalculated when the primary endpoint was 
switched. In addition, the size of the study population (n=334) was lower than those initially required 
for a power >85% (n=400). Therefore, the MAH was asked to discuss the implications for the 
statistical analysis and the robustness of the results. 
The MAH explained the reasons for switching the primary endpoint during study P069 (with 
Amendment 4) as driven by the change in the regulatory standards with a primary endpoint of all-
cause mortality at D42 for the treatment of IA.  
The MAH also explained why the sample size initially calculated had not been recalculated when the 
endpoint was switched. The amended study (with the all-cause mortality primary endpoint) for the 
same sample size (300 ITT population in each arm) has a 80% power to show non-inferiority with a 
10% margin and a 6-week mortality rate for voriconazole of 23%. 
The study results show that non-inferiority as pre-defined in the protocol was met in both cases. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 44/90 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered the response to indicate that after the endpoint switch the study retained a 
sufficient power and sample size to determine and meet pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority. 
Randomisation 
This study has randomization with 1:1 ratio.  
Subjects were to be stratified prior to treatment assignment by risk status for mortality/poor outcome. 
High Risk: Any one of the following are present at Baseline or in the patient’s medical history: 
• Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
• Relapsed leukaemia, undergoing salvage chemotherapy. 
• Liver transplant recipients. 
Not High Risk: Any other eligible subject (none of the high risk criteria are present at Baseline or in the 
subject’s medical history) 
Blinding (masking) 
This is a double blinded study. To maintain the blind in the POS group (whether IV or oral), a placebo 
is used for the second daily dose.  
Statistical methods 
Two populations were considered: 
- ITT: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
- FAS: all randomized subjects who were classified as having proven or probable IA (based upon 
independent adjudication assessment), and received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
For the difference between treatment groups in the all-cause mortality rate (for the ITT and FAS 
populations), the associated stratified 95% confidence interval (CI) on the difference was calculated. If 
the upper limit of the CI was <10% (the pre-specified non-inferiority margin), then non-inferiority of 
POS was declared. Survival rates were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  
For the difference between treatment groups in the proportion of subjects in the FAS population who 
achieved a global clinical response, the associated stratified 95% CI on the difference was calculated. 
Responses that were missing or could not be determined were considered as failures. The 6-week and 
12-week global clinical response assessments will be performed by the clinical adjudication committee 
(CAC, composed of independent blinded clinicians) based on the following information: clinical data, 
radiographic findings of infection, serologic testing and fungal culture and histology. This CAC also 
defined the diagnosis of IA (proven, probable or possible). 
The CHMP noted that the 10% non-inferiority margin is the same used in the isavuconazole vs VOR 
non-inferiority study CL-0104, and was endorsed by the FDA and EMA.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 653 individuals were screened, with 585 subjects randomized across 91 study sites in 26 
countries in the Asia/Pacific region, Europe, and North and South America. A total of 575 subjects 
received 1 or more doses of POS (n=288) or VOR (n=287). 
All subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug were to be followed for 
the entire duration of the study (through Day 114) for survival regardless of the duration of study 
therapy.

The proportions of subjects who completed the study (62.8% overall) and who completed study 
treatment (48.9% overall) were comparable in the POS and VOR treatment groups.  
The most common reason for discontinuation from the study in each treatment group was death, and 
the most common reason for discontinuation of study treatment was AE. 
The CHMP noted that the participant flow is similar between POS and VOR groups. In both groups, only 
half of participants have completed study treatment, mainly due to deaths and adverse events, 
reflecting the difficulties to treat IA. 
Recruitment 
The first patient first visit was 25 October 2013. The last patient last visit was 10 September 2019. 
All included subjects were treated for 12 weeks (84 days), with a maximum allowable duration up to 
98 days. A follow-up visit was required 30 days after completion of treatment.

Conduct of the study 
There were 5 amendments of the protocol: 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 62 subjects in this study. See details on the table 
below. No subject’s data were excluded from analyses due to an important protocol deviation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021

The CHMP noted that the main relevant protocol amendments were the exclusion of subjects <18 
years of age in EU and the change of the primary endpoint. Major protocol deviations are balanced 
between POS and VOR group (11.5% vs 10.5%). All subjects were part of the analyzed database.  
Numbers analysed 
The population was classified in two categories for analysis of the different endpoints: ITT (all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug) and FAS (all randomized subjects 
who were classified as having proven or probable IA and received at least 1 dose of study drug 
population) populations. 
Comparable proportions of subjects (between 55% and 60%) in the POS and VOR treatment groups 
were included in the FAS population.

The CHMP noted that the FAS population was 334 subjects. This is below the pre-defined target of 400 
FAS subjects (sample size to have power >85%), due to the higher proportion of subjects (41%) for 
whom their infection was not considered as a proven or probable IA by the CAC.  
The MAH explained that the sample size had a 80% power to show non-inferiority with a 10% margin 
and a 6-week mortality rate for voriconazole of 23%. The study results show that non-inferiority as 
pre-defined in the protocol has been met in both cases. The response indicates that after the endpoint 
switch the study retained a sufficient power and sample size to determine and meet pre-defined 
criteria for non-inferiority.

The baseline disease characteristics were indicative of a critically ill study population, with 39.3% of 
subjects in the ITT population considered to be high risk for IA. In the ITT population, the POS and 
VOR treatment groups were comparably balanced for most baseline characteristics, including 
investigators’ classification of risk status and laboratory determined presence of neutropenia 
A majority of subjects were male (59.8%) and white (67.1%). Two subjects had a baseline weight <40 
kg, while 6 had a baseline weight ≥120 kg. The median age was 57 years, with 27.8% of subjects 
overall aged ≥65 years; 5 subjects were adolescents, of whom 3 were treated with POS and 2 with 
VOR.  
IA was classified by independent adjudicators blinded to study treatment assignment as proven or 
probable in 58.1% of subjects overall. More POS-treated subjects were classified as having proven IA 
(9.0%) compared with VOR-treated subjects (5.2%), while fewer POS treated subjects were classified 
as having probable IA compared with VOR-treated subjects (47.6% and 54.4%, respectively). Subjects 
with proven or probable IA constituted the FAS population (n=334). 
Approximately 14% of subjects in the ITT population did not have an IA classification assigned; the 
primary reasons for this were insufficient information available to the adjudicators and/or co-
morbidities that confounded the classification diagnosis. 
The proportions of subjects with specific medical history conditions and with conditions in each SOC 
were generally comparable in the POS and VOR treatment groups. 
Almost all subjects (99.0%) reported use of prior medications, including antimycotics for systemic use 
(82.3% overall). Prior antimycotics included the study treatments POS (5.6% overall) and VOR (44.0% 
overall), with reported use balanced across the treatment groups. 
Nearly all subjects in each treatment group (ITT population) were compliant (ie, received >80% of 
assigned study therapy) with their treatment regimen (mean compliance >98% of assigned days of 
study treatment). Compliance was similarly high in the FAS population. 
Mean duration of exposure to study treatment in the ITT population was comparable in the POS and 
VOR treatment groups (67 days for POS and 64 days for VOR). Approximately 40% of subjects in each 
treatment group received study treatment for the planned duration of 84 days. 
Baseline data of identified germs consists in a total of 140 subjects who had a positive mold fungal 
culture identified by either the local or central laboratory. A majority (n=116) of these had a culture 
positive for Aspergillus only (≥1 species) with the remainder having a positive culture for non-
Aspergillus mold species only (n=17) or for Aspergillus plus non-Aspergillus mold species (n=7). For 
those with Aspergillus only, the most commonly identified species were A. fumigatus (in 71 subjects), 
A. flavus (22 subjects), A. niger (14 subjects), and A. terreus (8 subjects). The proportions of subjects 
infected with organisms from each of these categories were comparable between the treatment 
groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 52/90 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that, overall, all baseline characteristics were well balanced between both 
groups. The subjects included in this study were White or Asian adults (only 1% of Black/African 
American subjects and <1% adolescents) with blood and lymphatic system disorders (82%), with a 
good representativeness of gender, risk status and neutropenic status. As the study protocol allowed a 
brief period of systemic antifungal therapy given for the current episode of IA (up to 96 hours) prior to 
initiation of study antifungal treatment, a large proportion of subjects (82%) had previously been 
treated with antimycotics treatments, mainly with fluconazole (45%) or voriconazole (44%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 53/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, efficacy results according to the previous use or not of antifungal treatment should be 
provided (LOQ). 
This study has initially intended to enroll adolescent subjects, but finally included 99% of adults. 
Therefore, this study could not support alone an adolescent extension of the indication in the 
treatment of IA. PK bridging between adolescents and adults in IA treatment is required. 
Compliance and duration of treatment was also similar between both groups. 
Only 58% of the baseline IA diagnosis was probable or proven, and a non-negligible proportion of IA 
diagnosis (14%) cannot be determined at baseline by the CAC, suggesting that an undetermined 
number of subjects did not actually have IA. Aspergillus is the fungal agent most represented, without 
imbalance between both groups. However, only 24% of subjects overall had fungal culture results 
reported. A subgroup efficacy analysis by fungal species was not considered relevant by the MAH, 
which is endorsed by the CHMP.   
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Based on all-cause mortality through Day 42 in the ITT population, POS was demonstrated to be non-
inferior to VOR: 15.3% of subjects in the POS group, 20.6% in the VOR group, after stratification for 
risk of mortality/poor outcome, with an estimated difference of -5.3% [95% CI: -11.6, 1.0%]. Non-
inferiority of POS was demonstrated by the upper bound of the 95% CI on the estimated treatment 
difference being <10%, with a p-value of <0.0001. No subject in the ITT population had a Day 42 
mortality assessment that was missing or ‘unable to determine’, thus all subjects were included in the 
primary endpoint analysis. The difference in mortality between the POS and VOR treatment groups did 
not meet the criterion for superiority, as the upper limit of the 95% CI was not <0. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
All-cause mortality through Day 42, FAS Population 
These results support the primary endpoint result. In the FAS population, the incidence of all-cause 
mortality through Day 42 was 19.0% for the POS group and 18.7% for the VOR group with an 
estimated difference of 0.3% [95% CI: -8.2%, 8.8%]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 54/90 
 
 
 
 
 
All-cause mortality through Day 84, ITT and FAS Populations 
In the ITT population, 3 subjects, all in the VOR treatment group, had unknown or missing mortality 
status at Day 84 and were therefore counted as dead at that time point as was specified in the 
protocol. 
The CHMP considered that the three subjects with unknown status counted as dead in the ITT 
population do not change the results. The rates of all-cause mortality at day 84 between VOR and POS 
are comparable and consistent with the non-inferiority of POS vs VOR observed with the primary 
endpoint.   
Time to death (all causes) in the FAS population 
The cumulative all-cause mortality rates throughout the study period (i.e., through Day 114) in the ITT 
and FAS populations were comparable in the POS and VOR treatment groups.

EMA/590500/2021  
Page 55/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mortality due to IA through Day 42 and Day 84 in the FAS population 
The treatment-group comparison for attribution of death by the independent Clinical Adjudication 
Committee (CAC) to IA, to invasive fungal disease other than IA, or to another cause was limited by 
the high proportions of deaths adjudicated to an ‘indeterminate’ cause in the FAS population. This was 
particularly noteworthy for VOR-treated subjects, among whom 50% to 56% of deaths had an 
indeterminate attribution, compared with 36% to 41% of POS-treated subjects, depending on the time 
point. 
Among deaths for which the CAC was able to assign an attribution, at Week 6 (Day 42), 16 of 20 (80.0 
%) deaths in the POS group were attributed to IA compared with 10 of 14 (71.4%) deaths in the VOR 
group. At Week 12 (Day 84), 22 of 33 (66.7%) deaths in the POS group were attributed to IA 
compared with 14 of 22 (63.6%) in the VOR group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 56/90 
 
 
 
 
  
The CHMP noted that, when considering the mortality due to IA (according to the CAC), the results are 
not at the advantage of POS. At each time points (Day 42, Day 84 and Day 114), the mortality 
attributed to IA is more frequent in POS group compared to VOR group. However, a higher number of 
indeterminate attribution of death is present in VOR group, which could bias the estimation of the 
mortality due to IA. Indeed, it is expected that a significant proportion of these undetermined deaths 
were actually due to IA (probably combined with other pathologies or infections).  
Without considering the indeterminate attributions of death, there is still a 10% difference of mortality 
between POS and VOR groups at day 42 (80% [16/20] vs 71% [10/14]), but the number of subject is 
too low to draw any conclusion. This difference was not retrieved at Day 84 (67% [22/33] vs 64% 
[14/22]) and Day 114 (61% [23/38] vs 61% [17/28]). 
In conclusion, these results of deaths attributed to IA may be biased due to the imbalance of the 
number of indeterminate attribution of death by the CAC. Furthermore, these results are not consistent 
with the other efficacy endpoints, and they cannot alone challenge the non-inferiority of POS vs VOR. 
To be reassured, the CHMP requested that the MAH reassessed the mortality data of all subjects for 
whom no cause of death was attributed, and specify among them whether IA was suspected and the 
number of subjects with probable or proven IA in each groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 57/90 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH explained that independent adjudication of each subject was performed by a central 
adjudication committee (CAC). A listing of the subjects in the FAS population who died through Day 
114 and had indeterminate attribution of death as classified by central adjudication is shown below. 
There were 26 posaconazole treated subjects and 28 voriconazole treated subjects who were classified 
as having an indeterminate cause of death during the study period (through Day 114). This listing 
displays the primary cause of death as provided by the study investigators who oversaw the study at a 
given site. Of the 26 posaconazole treated subjects with indeterminate cause of death by the CAC, no 
subject was identified as having death related to invasive aspergillosis or an invasive fungal infection. 
In comparison, of the 28 voriconazole treated subjects with indeterminate cause of death by the CAC, 
3 subjects were identified as having death related to aspergillus infection, systemic mycoses, or fungal 
pneumonia. 
The CHMP considered that the MAH satisfactorily clarified that none of the 26 POS treated subjects and 
three of the 28 VOR subjects with an indeterminate cause of death, were identified as having death 
caused by IA of other invasive fungal disease. With this reassessment, the proportion of deaths 
attributable to IA and IFD becomes more balanced: 24/64 for POS and 20/56 for VOR, though overall 
the number of deaths remains unfavourable to the POS group.  
Global Clinical Response at Weeks 6 and 12, FAS Population 
Global response was assessed by the CAC as success (partial or complete) or failure (stable response, 
disease progression, or death). Approximately 10% of subjects in each treatment group, at both Week 
6 and Week 12, were given an adjudicated response outcome of “unable to determine” and were 
counted as ‘failures’ for the purpose of treatment comparison. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 58/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP pointed out that, according to the CHMP scientific advice on the change of primary endpoint, 
this endpoint “global clinical response at week 6” should be maintained and considered as a co-primary 
endpoint.  
The results are comparable for all types of response (successes and failures) between POS and VOR at 
week 6 and week 12, and support the non-inferiority conclusion of the primary endpoint. Of note, this 
FAS population contains only 334 subjects, which is inferior to the targeted 400 subjects to ensure a 
power >85% for statistical analysis.  
The MAH however explained that the sample size had a 80% power to show non-inferiority with a 10% 
margin. The study results show that non-inferiority as pre-defined in the protocol was met in both 
cases. The explanation indicates that after the endpoint switch the study retained a sufficient power 
and sample size to determine and meet pre-defined criteria for non-inferiority. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
Overall, mortality was higher for older subjects and for subjects with extra-pulmonary site(s) of 
infection or with neutropenia at baseline or with proven IA. When evaluating mortality by treatment 
group, observed mortality rates were either comparable across treatment groups or lower (with a 95% 
CI that did not contain 0) in the POS group than in the VOR group. All-cause mortality rates were 
lower for POS compared with VOR for subjects in the following demographic and baseline disease 
subgroups: age (18 to 57 [median age]), sex (male), race (white), and baseline adjudication of 
possible IA. On the contrary, all-cause mortality rates were higher for POS compared with VOR for 
Asian subjects.

In the FAS population, all-cause mortality rates through Day 42 were generally comparable between 
treatment groups. 
The CHMP considered that, overall, subgroup efficacy analyses for the ITT population were supportive 
of the primary efficacy endpoint analysis, with non-inferiority of POS to VOR by subgroup variables. 
However, the mortality in the Asian population was higher in the POS group (16%, 10/62) than the 
VOR group (6.7%, 4/60). This higher mortality rate is also observed within the FAS population (POS: 
21% (9/43); VOR: 6.5% (3/46)). Based on PPK analysis, no subexposure is expected within the Asian 
population, with furthermore a lower POS clearance and thus an increase of POS Cavg by 33% in 
Chinese patients. This increase was not considered clinically meaningful. Considering the low number 
of subjects in this subgroup, and the lack of efficacy concerns particularly observed in the Asian 
population with the current use of POS, these subgroups results are not considered relevant. Subgroup 
analysis including prior medication with antimycotics during the 3 days before starting the study 
treatment was requested.  
The provided Subgroup analysis of study subjects that received prior antimycotic therapy showed that 
a large proportion (80%) of subjects in both groups (227/288 in the POS group and 229/287 in the 
VOR group) received prior antimycotics, which was allowed by the protocol. Overall, the use of 
antimycotics by class is balanced between the two treatment groups. The influence of prior treatment 
on the primary outcomes are rather inconclusive. However, as the proportion of pre-treated patients is 
very high, it drives the overall response results:

As the proportion of pre-treated subjects as well as the primary outcomes are comparable between the 
two groups (POS and VOR), the CHMP considered that it could be assumed that there is no impact on 
the non-inferiority results. 
The CHMP additionally noted that in the POS SmPC, the recommended treatment duration for IA is 6-
12 weeks. It was also noted that approximately 40% of subjects have been treated with POS or VOR 
for less than 6 weeks, including 30-35% for less than 4 weeks.  
The MAH was asked to provide efficacy outcomes according to treatment duration (<6 weeks, 6 weeks 
to <12 weeks, ≥12 weeks) and to justify the recommended treatment duration for IA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 61/90 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH provided justification for the treatment duration: the study was designed for a 12 week 
treatment duration, and it was noted that failure rate in the sub-group treated for less than 42 days 
was more than 40% compared to the overall rate of 15% for the all-cause mortality and respectively 
more than 90% compared to the overall failure rate of 55% for the global clinical response. More 
importantly, the results are comparable between the POS and VOR treatments, regardless of the 
treatment duration and are consistent with the overall non-inferiority results.  
Therefore, the data suggests a duration of treatment of more than 6 weeks. It seems that the overall 
success rate does not improve beyond 12 weeks of treatment. Therefore, the CHMP considered the 
proposed statement in the SmPC: ‘Recommended total duration of therapy is 6-12 weeks’ to be 
supported.  
Exposure-Efficacy Relationship (see also PK/PD section) 
For subjects with evaluable exposure data, there was no discernible trend across quartiles of POS 
trough plasma concentrations for the key efficacy endpoint of all-cause mortality through Day 42 in the 
ITT population. Same results are noted for the global clinical response at Week 6. These data suggest 
that POS exposures achieved in P069 with the IV and tablet formulations were on the plateau of the 
exposure-efficacy curve, where efficacy is relatively insensitive to changes in exposure. 
However, it can be noted that subjects without evaluable POS exposure data had higher mortality rates 
than subjects with such data. The lower efficacy in these subjects may be a consequence of the fact 
that subjects who died or remained seriously ill were less likely to have evaluable exposure data, 
potentially introducing bias into the exposure-efficacy analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 62/90 
 
 
 
 
 
For VOR, subjects in the highest quartile of VOR trough plasma concentration and those without 
evaluable VOR exposure data had higher all-cause mortality through Day 42 than subjects in the lower 
3 quartiles of VOR trough concentration in the ITT population. Same results for the global clinical 
response at Week 6.  
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 63/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP considered that these data suggest a larger therapeutic margin with POS than with VOR, 
with higher rates of mortality and lower clinical response with the higher exposures of VOR, conversely 
to POS where higher exposures seem to not impact these endpoints. 
The lower efficacy of POS or VOR treatment in the population without available exposition data may be 
subject to interpretations. As stated by the MAH, these data may reflect that subjects with higher 
advanced disease (and a poor prognosis) were less likely to have evaluable exposure data, potentially 
introducing bias into the exposure-efficacy analysis. These data may also suggest that a therapeutic 
drug monitoring of POS or VOR is associated to a better outcome.

All-cause mortality at day 42:  
Statistical methodology: The primary endpoint was assessed using a non-
inferiority margin of 10%; if the upper limit of the 95% CI, adjusted for 
stratification factors for the difference in success rates, was less than 10%, 
non-inferiority was to be declared. If non-inferiority was declared, superiority 
of POS over VOR was to be assessed and declared if the upper limit of the 
95% CI was <0%.

Notes 
While there was no formal statistical evaluation of global clinical response in 
the FAS population, it was noted that the proportions of observed global 
clinical responses were similar in the POS and VOR treatment groups at Week 
6. 
Approximately 10% in each group were unable to assess and not counted as 
success or failure. 
Additional clinical data 
The MAH has performed a systematic literature review to understand the efficacy/effectiveness of POS 
as monotherapy or combination therapy in the treatment of IFIs other than IA, consisting of the 
following: chromoblastomycoses (caused by Fonsecea, Phialophora, Cladosporium, Exophilia, or 
Chromoblastomycosis not specified), fungal mycetoma (caused by Eumycetoma, mycotic mycetoma, 
and fungal mycetoma not specified), hyalohyphomycosis/phaeohyphomycosis (caused by Fusarium,

Scedosporium, Pseudoallescheria, Talaromyces, and Penicillium spp.), and mucormycosis (caused by 
Rhizopus, Mucor, Cunnighamella, Apophysomyces, Lictheimia (Absidia), Saksenaea, Rhizomucor, 
Mucormycetes not specified, and Zygomycosis not specified). 
Over the past 14 years, 351 articles have been published describing the efficacy of POS in the 
treatment of these rare IFIs (chromoblastomycosis, fungal mycetoma, 
hyalohyphomycosis/phaeohyphomycosis and mucormycosis). The literature-based evidence consists of 
observational evidence (mostly case reports). The majority of evidence was found in mucormycosis 
followed by hyalohyphomycosis/ phaeohyphomycosis, and chromoblastomycosis. Positive clinical 
outcomes with POS therapy were observed in 66.7% (564/845) of mucormycosis cases, 53.3% 
(49/92) of hyalohyphomycosis/ phaeohyphomycosis cases, and 73.9% (17/23) of 
chromoblastomycosis cases. Very sparse evidence was found for fungal mycetoma (2 positive cases). 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Posaconazole (IV and tablet forms) is currently indicated in the treatment and prophylaxis of the 
following IFI in adults: Invasive aspergillosis (in patients with disease that is refractory to amphotericin 
B or itraconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these medicinal products); fusariosis (in patients 
with disease that is refractory to amphotericin B or in patients who are intolerant of amphotericin B); 
chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma (in patients with disease that is refractory to itraconazole or in 
patients who are intolerant of itraconazole); coccidioidomycosis (in patients with disease that is 
refractory to amphotericin B, itraconazole or fluconazole or in patients who are intolerant of these 
medicinal products). 
In current practice, voriconazole is used as first line therapy in IA. Isavuconazole showed non 
inferiority to voriconazole in CL-104 study and has also the indication in IA since 2015.  
Regarding difficulties to treat IA and the known adverse events and DDI of voriconazole and 
isavuconazole, there is a need a need for additional therapies with at least similar levels of efficacy.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This extension of indication is based on the non-inferiority study P069 performed in patients with 
possible, probable or proven IA. Subjects with baseline possible IA have additional diagnostic to 
confirm the IA. In the event that possible IA was not confirmed, the patients may continue to be 
treated if clinician deems appropriate. Subjects should not have history of chronic, recurrent or 
refractory IA, consistency with the claimed first line treatment of IA, but an antifungal therapy started 
since 3 days maximum is tolerated. All patients were randomized 1:1 to receive POS or VOR with IV or 
oral formulation, according to the clinical status of the patient. POS oral suspension was not used, this 
extension of indication did not concern this formulation due to the differences between tablets and oral 
suspension in frequency of dosing, administration with food and plasma drug concentration achieved. 
Two populations were studied: 
- 
- 
ITT population: all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
FAS population: all randomized subjects who were classified as having proven or probable IA 
(based upon independent adjudication assessment by the CAC), and received at least 1 dose of 
study drug. 
To assess the non-inferiority of POS vs VOR, the primary endpoint was changed during study and was 
defined as the all-cause mortality through day 42 in the ITT population, similarly than the non-
inferiority study CL-104 (ISA vs VOR). However, in accordance to the EMA scientific advice, the initial 
Assessment report

primary endpoint - global clinical response at week 6 in the FAS population - must be also considered 
as a co-primary endpoint for the non-inferiority assessment of POS vs VOR. The 10% non-inferiority 
margin is endorsed.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, 575 subjects were part of the ITT population and randomized in a 1:1 ratio (POS = 288, VOR 
= 287). 26 countries in the Asia/Pacific region, Europe and North and South America were 
represented. Baseline data are similar between POS and VOR groups. A majority of subjects were male 
(59.8%) and white (67.1%), with a median age at 57 years. Only 5 subjects were adolescents <18 
years old, although this study has initially intended to enrol both adolescent and adult subjects. 
Therefore, this study could not support alone an adolescent extension of the indication in the 
treatment of IA. Only 1% of subjects were black/African American, but the known PK data of POS 
suggest the lack of significant effect of race on POS exposure for the tablets and IV formulations. 
Only 58% of the baseline IA diagnosis was probable or proven, but a non-negligible proportion of IA 
diagnosis (14%) cannot be determined at baseline by the CAC. Aspergillus (and especially A. 
fumigatus) is the fungal agent most represented, without imbalance between both groups. However, 
only 24% of subjects had fungal culture results reported.  
The non-inferiority of POS vs VOR in the first-line treatment of IA was demonstrated. In the ITT 
population, the mortality rate at Day 42 was 15.3% in the POS group and 20.6% in the VOR group, 
after stratification for risk of mortality/poor outcome (difference: -5.3% [95% CI: -11.6, 1.0%]). In 
the FAS population, the global clinical response at 6 week (considered as a co-primary endpoint) also 
demonstrate a non-inferiority of POS vs VOR. Proportion of success were 44.8% for POS and 45.6% 
for VOR, with comparable proportion in complete and partial success (difference: -0.6% [95% CI: -
11.01, 10.1]).  
Other secondary endpoints support the non-inferiority of POS vs VOR, excepted the secondary 
endpoint “mortality due to IA (according to the CAC)”, with higher rates at each time points in the POS 
group than in the VOR group (Day 42: 51.6% vs 31.3% ; Day 84: 39.3% vs 28.0% ; Day 114: 35.9% 
vs 30.4%). However, approximately half of the deaths have an indeterminate relationship with IA or 
other IFI, with a higher proportion in the VOR group, which could bias the estimation of the mortality 
due to IA. Indeed, it is expected that a significant proportion of these undetermined deaths were 
actually due to IA (probably combined with other pathologies or infections). Upon request by the 
CHMP, the MAH reassessed the mortality data of all subjects for whom no cause of death was 
attributed, and specified among them whether IA was suspected and the number of subjects with 
probable or proven IA in each groups. The MAH satisfactorily clarified that none of the 26 POS treated 
subjects and three of the 28 VOR subjects with an indeterminate cause of death, were identified as 
having death caused by IA of other invasive fungal disease. With this reassessment, the proportion of 
deaths attributable to IA and IFD becomes more balanced: 24/64 for POS and 20/56 for VOR, though 
overall the number of deaths remains unfavourable to the POS group.  
Subgroup analysis are supportive to the non-inferiority results. Considering that prior medication with 
antimycotics was authorized for 3 days maximum before to start study treatment, which potentially 
may influence the outcome, a subgroup analysis by prior medication with antimycotics should be 
added.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
An indication of POS for the first-line treatment of IA in paediatric patients is not claimed at this stage. 
The efficacy in IA was not demonstrated for paediatric patients in P069 study, with only 5 adolescents 
enrolled.  
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, POS is non-inferior to VOR for the first-line treatment of adults with probable, possible 
or proven IA, based on the all-cause mortality rate and global clinical response at 6 weeks.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety analyses in P069 were based on the APaT population, consisting of all randomized subjects who 
received ≥1 dose of study treatment. The ITT population, consisting of all randomized subjects who 
received ≥1 dose of study drug, was used for the primary efficacy analysis (all-cause mortality through 
Day 42). The APaT and ITT populations were identical. 
The overall adverse event (AE) profile in P069 was reflective of the known AE profile of POS IV and 
tablet, as described in product labeling, and was consistent with a critically ill study population.  
Furthermore, the types and incidences of AEs, drug-related AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) in 
the POS treatment group in P069 were similar to those reported in previous clinical studies of POS IV 
and tablet despite P069 having a longer duration of treatment (average therapy duration of >60 days 
for the treatment of IA) compared with previous studies of POS IV and tablet (average therapy 
durations of <30 days in a prophylaxis setting).  
The proportion of subjects with a drug-related AE was lower in the POS treatment group (29.9%) than 
in the VOR treatment group (40.1%).  Treatment was discontinued due to a drug-related AE in 6.3% 
of POS-treated subjects compared with 9.8% of VOR-treated subjects.  No POS-treated subject died 
due to a drug-related SAE compared with 3 VOR-treated subjects. The incidences of AEs, SAEs, 
deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs were similar for subjects in the POS and VOR treatment 
groups. 
Patient exposure 
In study P069, 288 subjects were randomized and treated with POS IV or tablet at a dose of 300 mg 
QD (300 mg BID on Day 1) compared with 287 subjects randomized and treated with VOR 4 mg/kg IV 
BID (6 mg/kg IV BID on Day 1) or 200 mg oral BID (300 mg oral BID on Day 1).  The median duration 
of exposure in the ITT population was 67 days in the POS group and 64 days in the VOR group. 
Approximately 40% of subjects in each treatment group received study treatment for the planned 
duration of 84 days (maximum allowed duration of 98 days). 
Approximately 55% to 60% of subjects started treatment with the IV formulation of either POS or 
VOR. 
Adverse events 
Overall, the AE profile was reflective of a critically ill study population. Nearly all subjects in both 
treatment groups experienced 1 or more AEs during the treatment period or within 30 days following 
the last dose. The proportion of subjects with drug-related AEs was lower in the POS treatment group

than in the VOR treatment group; the incidences of AEs, SAEs, deaths, and discontinuations due to AEs 
were similar for subjects in the POS and VOR treatment groups.  
The overall proportions of subjects with AEs in a given SOC were comparable between the 2 treatment 
groups; AEs categorized within the SOCs of Infections and Infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders 
were the most frequently reported. 
In this critically ill population, the most frequently reported AEs were hypokalaemia, pyrexia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, ALT increased, and febrile neutropenia in the POS group; and pyrexia, diarrhoea, 
nausea, and hypokalaemia in the VOR group. The frequencies and types of AEs were generally 
comparable across both treatment groups, although the AE of hypokalaemia was reported more 
frequently for POS-treated subjects (28.5%) than for VOR-treated subjects (17.1%). 
The proportion of subjects with AEs that were considered by the investigator(s) to be related to study 
drug (i.e. drug-related) was lower in the POS group compared with the VOR group (-10.2%; 
95% CI: -17.9, -2.4). The only drug-related AEs reported for >5% of subjects (in either treatment 
group) were ALT increased, AST increased, and blood alkaline phosphatase increased.  
When analyzed by drug-related AEs occurring in ≥4 subjects in either treatment group (ie, Tier-2 
events, as prespecified in the protocol, a lower proportion of POS-treated subjects than VOR-treated 
subjects reported drug-related AEs applicable to the SOCs of Eye disorders (-8.0%; 95% 
CI: -12.2, -4.5) and Psychiatric disorders. These differences were driven by between-group differences 
in the AEs of dyschromatopsia, vision blurred, visual impairment, and hallucination, each of which was 
reported at a lower incidence for POS-treated subjects compared with VOR-treated. A higher 
proportion of subjects with drug-related AEs in the Metabolism and Nutrition disorders SOC was noted 
for the POS treatment group compared with the VOR group (estimate: 3.8%; 95% CI: 0.5, 7.5), with 
the AE of hypokalaemia being the basis for this treatment difference.

 † Based on Miettinen & Nurminen method. 
 Every subject is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A system organ class or specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in 
one or more of the columns meets the incidence criterion in the report title. 
 Estimated differences and confidence intervals are provided in accordance with the 
statistical analysis plan. 
 Adverse events are reported from the first dose of study treatment through 30 days after 
the last dose. 
The  CHMP  considered  that,  in  this  study,  the  safety  profile  for  POS  was  well  established.  Adverse 
events incidence was high in all groups, which was expected in this critically ill population. 
In this critically ill population, the most frequently reported AEs were hypokalaemia, pyrexia, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, ALT increased, and febrile neutropenia in the POS group

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Death 
A total of 173 (30.1%) subjects died during the full study period, through Day 114. In the POS group, 
no subject had a drug-related AE that resulted in death. In the VOR group, 3 subjects had drug-related 
AEs (pancreatitis, cerebral disorder, encephalopathy) that resulted in death. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
The proportions of subjects with SAEs were generally comparable across both groups, as were the 
proportions of subjects with drug-related SAEs, discontinuations due to SAEs, and discontinuations due 
to drug-related SAEs.  
The frequencies and types of SAEs were generally comparable in both treatment groups, with the 
exception of SAEs of hypokalaemia and haemoptysis, which were reported more frequently in the POS 
group (n=4 each SAE) than in the VOR group (n=0 each SAE). 
The overall proportion of subjects with drug-related SAEs was 7.0% in each group. The most 
commonly reported drug-related SAEs were ALT increased (n=3) in the POS treatment group and 
encephalopathy (n=3) in the VOR treatment group.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest – Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Hepatic Safety Events 
Tier-1 hepatic safety events comprised AST or ALT laboratory values ≥ 3xULN together with both an 
elevated total bilirubin value ≥ 2xULN and an alkaline phosphatase value < 2xULN.  
Comparable rates of Tier-1 hepatic safety events were noted for subjects in POS (3.8%) and VOR 
(3.5%) treatment groups.  
Central Nervous System and Visual Safety Events 
Approximately one-third of subjects in each treatment group experienced an AE in the CNS and visual 
safety cat. A lower proportion of subjects in the POS group (6.6%) reported AEs in the SOC of Eye 
disorders compared with the VOR group (12.5%).  
Treatment differences were not observed in the incidence of Tier-1 AEs associated with the SOCs of 
Nervous System disorders (POS: 20.8%; VOR: 18.5%) or Psychiatric disorders (POS: 12.2%; VOR: 
16.4%). Within the Psychiatric disorders SOC, the most commonly reported Tier-1 AEs were 
confusional state (3.5% in the POS group, 5.6% in the VOR group) and hallucination (2.1% and 5.2%, 
respectively); the between-group treatment difference (-3.1%; 95% CI: -6.6, -0.1) in the incidence of 
hallucination favored POS.  
Treatment-related Central Nervous System and Visual Safety Events 
The overall proportion of subjects with drug-related AEs reported in the CNS and visual safety category 
was lower in the POS group (5.6%) compared with the VOR group (16.4%). 
The incidence of drug-related Tier-1 AEs classified within the SOC of Eye disorders was lower in 
POS-treated subjects (1.7%) than in VOR-treated subjects (9.4%) (-7.7%; 95% CI: -11.8, -4.2). 
Specifically, drug-related AEs of dyschromatopsia, vision blurred, and vision impairment occurred less 
frequently in the POS group than in the VOR group.  
There were no notable between-group differences in drug-related Tier-1 AEs associated with the SOC 
of Nervous System disorders.  
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021

A difference in the incidence of drug-related Tier-1 AEs for the SOC of Psychiatric disorders was 
observed, with a lower proportion of POS-treated subjects (2.1%) experiencing AEs classified for the 
Psychiatric disorder SOC compared with VOR-treated subjects (6.6%) (-4.5%; 95% CI: -8.3, -1.3). In 
particular, it was noted that the incidence of drug-related hallucination was lower in POS-treated 
subjects (1.4%) than in VOR-treated subjects (4.2%).  
The most frequently reported (incidence ≥1%) drug-related CNS and visual safety AEs were as 
follows:  
• 
POS treatment group: hallucination (1.4%) and vision blurred (1.0%) 
•  VOR treatment group: hallucination (4.2%), vision blurred (3.5%), dyschromatopsia (2.1%), 
photopsia (2.1%), visual impairment (2.1%), visual hallucination (1.7%), dizziness (1.0%), 
and encephalopathy (1.0%). 
Serious Central Nervous System and Visual Safety Events 
The overall proportion of subjects with SAEs in the Nervous System or Eye Disorder SOC was low in 
the POS (3.8%) and VOR (5.6%) treatment groups. There were no meaningful treatment differences in 
the incidences of SAEs categorized within the SOCs of Eye disorders, Nervous System disorders, or 
Psychiatric disorders, and there were no meaningful differences in SAEs within these SOCs leading to 
treatment discontinuations.  
Dermatologic Events 
The incidences of subjects who had a Tier-1 AE in the dermatologic reactions category 
(i.e., prespecified PTs in the SOCs of Immune System disorders and Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue 
disorders were comparable in the POS (16.3%) and VOR (19.2%) treatment groups. The most 
frequently reported AE in the dermatologic reactions category was rash (approximately 7% in each 
treatment group). 
There were no drug-related AEs within the SOC of Immune System disorders. The incidence of drug-
related AEs categorized as Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue disorders was low in both treatment groups.  
Events Related to Adrenal Steroidogenesis or Hypotension  
Comparable incidences of AEs in the Adrenal Steroidogenesis category (i.e., prespecified PTs in the 
SOCs of Endocrine disorders and Vascular disorders) were reported for subjects in the POS (8.0%) and 
VOR (7.0%) treatment groups. Hypotension was reported by approximately 7% of subjects in each 
group. 
Two subjects, both in the POS group, had drug-related AEs in either the Endocrine disorder SOC or 
Vascular disorder SOC. One subject had drug-related adrenal insufficiency, and 1 subject had drug-
related hypotension.  
Most Frequently Reported Adverse Events by Posaconazole Plasma Concentration Quartile 
Exposure-safety relationships of POS by quartile of exposure were evaluated for all AEs as well as 
treatment-related AEs. Exposure Cmin quartiles were: 244 to 1046 ng/mL (Q1); 1046 to 1625 ng/mL 
(Q2); 1625 to 2274 ng/mL (Q3); and 2274 to 5550 ng/mL (Q4). The range of POS trough 
concentrations was consistent with the known exposure profile of POS IV and POS tablet.  
In the evaluation of exposure-safety relationships of POS by quartile of exposure, there were no 
meaningful differences in the AE incidence overall or for any given SOC across quartile exposure 
ranges. Additionally there were analyses (bimodal) for specific AEs of interest that did not suggest a 
trend of exposure with the occurrence of these AEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 73/90 
 
 
 
 
Of those AEs reported by ≥10% of subjects, the incidence of any given AE or of all AEs within a given 
SOC category was not notably different across the exposure quartiles, or did not follow any overall 
pattern with respect to increasing exposure, with few exceptions, including ALT increased. The AEs of 
pyrexia, AST increased, hypomagnesemia, fatigue, and asthenia were reported more frequently for 
subjects in Q4 relative to those in Q1. The reverse was true for subjects in Q1 who generally had a 
higher prevalence of diarrhea, dyspnea, bacteremia, and neutropenia than did subjects in Q4. Given 
this critically-ill population, and the variability of AE incidence across the quartile ranges of exposure, 
these findings are not considered clinically meaningful.  
Adverse Events Related to Study Treatment by Posaconazole Plasma Concentration Quartile 
Among subjects with available trough plasma POS concentrations, there was a trend toward a higher 
incidence of drug-related AEs in the highest quartile of POS exposure relative to lower-exposure 
quartiles 1. Specifically, a higher incidence of drug-related ALT increased, nausea, and vomiting were 
noted with higher POS exposures relative to lower trough plasma concentrations. While there is a trend 
of a higher incidence of drug-related AEs in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 or 2, it is a modest 
one, and its non-monotonic increase with exposures is not suggestive of a strong PK relationship.

Posaconazole Trough Concentration 
This observation is in contrast to that reported for earlier studies of POS IV (Study P05520; 
MK-5592-059) and POS tablet (Study P05615; MK-5592-065) in which the same dosing regimen was 
used (300 mg/day after BID dosing on Day 1 with QD dosing thereafter) given as antifungal 
prophylaxis to patients at high risk for an IFI. Exposure-safety quartile relationships for these 2 earlier 
studies were evaluated across a similar range of exposures.  
For the earlier POS tablet study described above, a quartile analysis (n= 205) found no discernible 
correlation between POS plasma exposures and safety in terms of AEs or drug-related AEs, including 
no correlation between higher POS exposure and an increase in hepatic or cardiac AEs. Specifically, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 74/90 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incidence of drug-related AEs was lower for the fourth highest quartile of exposure when compared 
with the first lowest quartile of exposure (38% versus 57%).  
Exposure-safety findings for the POS IV study P05520 were similar. Overall, the safety profiles in 
P05520 and P05616 for those subjects who achieved high POS exposures following administration of 
POS IV and POS tablet, respectively, are consistent with the safety profiles for those subjects who 
achieve normal/low POS exposures. In these 2 studies, no new safety signals were identified in 
subjects with high POS exposures, and specific AEs expected to be seen with POS were not more 
commonly seen in the high-exposure group. 
The CHMP noted that, in the POS group, no subject had a drug-related AE that resulted in death 
The frequencies and types of SAEs were generally comparable in both treatment groups, with the 
exception of SAEs of hypokalaemia and haemoptysis, which were reported more frequently in the 
POS group. Therefore, the Committee asked the MAH to explain this difference and also discuss if 
these events were the drug-related. 
The MAH reviewed the reports of serious adverse events of hypokalaemia and hemoptysis (4 each) 
in P069. In line with the investigators’ assessment, the MAH considered none of this SAEs drug-
related. This was endorsed by the CHMP.  
The CHMP considered that treatment differences were not observed in the incidence of Tier-1 AEs 
associated with the SOCs of Nervous System disorders or Psychiatric disorders (POS: 12.2%; VOR: 
16.4%). Within the Psychiatric disorders SOC, the most commonly reported Tier-1 AEs were 
confusional state and hallucination. 
The most frequently reported AE in the dermatologic reactions category was rash (approximately 
7% in each treatment group). 
There were no drug-related AEs within the SOC of Immune System disorders. The incidence of drug-
related AEs categorized as Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue disorders was low in both treatment 
groups.  
Comparable incidences of AEs in the Adrenal Steroidogenesis category (i.e. prespecified PTs in the 
SOCs of Endocrine disorders and Vascular disorders) were reported for subjects in the POS and VOR 
treatment groups. Hypotension was reported by approximately 7% of subjects in each group. 
Two subjects, both in the POS group, had drug-related AEs in either the Endocrine disorder SOC or 
Vascular disorder SOC. One subject had drug-related adrenal insufficiency, and 1 subject had drug-
related hypotension.  
The CHMP considered that, in this study, the safety profile of POS was well established.  
Among subjects with available trough plasma POS concentrations, there was a trend toward a higher 
incidence of drug-related AEs in the highest quartile of POS exposure relative to lower-exposure 
quartiles 1. Specifically, a higher incidence of drug-related ALT increased, nausea, and vomiting 
were noted with higher POS exposures relative to lower trough plasma concentrations. While there is 
a trend of a higher incidence of drug-related AEs in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 or 2. This 
observation is in contrast to that reported for earlier studies of POS IV (Study P05520; 
MK-5592-059) and POS tablet (Study P05615; MK-5592-065). According to the MAH, this difference 
may be attributed, at least in part, to differences in bioavailability between formulations (tablet 
bioavailability 54% under fasting conditions). It may also reflect that subjects who remained on IV 
Assessment report

were more seriously ill and unable to transition to an oral formulation since a similar trend (higher 
IV concentration) was observed for VOR, which has high oral bioavailability (96%). With regard to 
an evaluation of the effect of food on POS tablet absorption, the modest (15% to 39%, depending 
on time point) increase in POS exposure when POS tablets were administered with a meal versus 
fasting is not considered to be clinically meaningful. A detailed comparison of POS exposure across 
studies based on a population PK analysis was reported separately.  
Laboratory findings 
There were comparable rates of hepatic function elevations for the 2 treatment groups. In particular, 
with regards to the incidence of prespecified Tier-1 hepatic safety event (AT ≥3 ULN and BILI ≥2 
ULN and ALP <2 ULN), there was no evidence of an increase in Tier-1 hepatic events for POS 
compared with VOR (3.9% vs 3.5%, respectively). 
Electrocardiogram findings 
ECG data were collected in accordance with the protocol, which included stipulation that subjects on IV 
therapy have their Week 1 ECG performed at the completion of the 90-minute infusion to coincide with 
the time of anticipated Cmax and plasma sample collection. No clinically meaningful ECG findings were 
noted at the time of Cmax in subjects on IV therapy; therefore, an exposure-ECG-response analysis 
was not conducted. 
For ECG findings meeting predetermined criteria, POS-treated subjects, relative to VOR-treated 
subjects, had a lower incidence of QTc >500 msec, QTc increases from baseline >60 msec, and any 
change in prespecified QTc parameters. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 33.9% of subjects.  
Drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 8.0% of subjects. Fewer POS-
treated subjects (6.3%) discontinued treatment for a drug-related AE compared with VOR-treated 
subjects (9.8%). In both groups, drug-related AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were most 
commonly classified within the SOCs of Investigations, Nervous System disorders, and Psychiatric 
disorders. The most commonly reported drug-related AE leading to treatment discontinuation in both 
groups was hallucination (n=3 in each group).  
SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 27.5% of subjects. The most frequently 
reported SAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were septic shock (2.8%) and respiratory failure 
(2.4%) in the POS group, and septic shock (2.8%) and acute myeloid leukaemia (2.8%) in the VOR 
group. 
The CHMP noted that fewer POS-treated subjects (6.3%) discontinued treatment for a drug-related AE 
compared with VOR-treated subjects (9.8%). The most commonly reported drug-related AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation in both groups was hallucination (n=3 in each group). 
Post marketing experience 
POS has been registered and approved in more than 70 countries since its first approval on 
25-Oct-2005. Currently there are 3 marketed formulations of POS: oral suspension, delayed-release 
tablet, and concentrate for solution for IV infusion. There are no records of any registration being 
revoked or withdrawn for safety reasons. The benefit-risk information on POS received by the MAH’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 76/90 
 
 
 
 
AE reporting and review system has been summarized in the PSUR and is currently conducted on a 
3-year cycle in the EU. 
Cumulative post-marketing exposure for POS was calculated from information provided by IMS Health, 
the MAH’s internal distribution data from the Worldwide Financial Reporting System, and the Financial 
Sharing Area databases. Total cumulative patient exposure for POS through 25-Oct-2019 was 
approximately 107,572 patient-years of treatment (46,987 for the OS; 59,590 for tablets; and 995 for 
the IV formulation). 
As of 25-Oct-2019, there were 6240 AE reports containing 13,091 events (7725 nonserious, 5366 
serious) from spontaneous and noninterventional post-marketing study reports in the Company’s 
global safety database. There were no new safety signals identified in the most recent PSUR for POS. 
A cumulative analysis of post-marketing AEs, as of 25-Oct-2019, did not identify new safety issues for 
POS. The safety profile revealed by the current analysis is consistent with those presented in PSURs 
submitted to date and those in the product label. The overall benefit-risk balance for POS continues to 
be positive for use in the approved indications. The MAH will continue to monitor the safety of POS 
through established routine pharmacovigilance processes. 
A cumulative analysis of post-marketing AEs, as of 25-Oct-2019, did not identify new safety issues for 
POS. The overall benefit-risk balance for POS continues to be positive for use in the approved 
indications. The MAH will continue to monitor the safety of POS through established routine 
pharmacovigilance processes. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety findings of this study were consistent with those reported for prior clinical studies of POS in 
prophylaxis and secondary invasive fungal infection treatment. POS was well tolerated and, while 
almost all subjects had one or more reported AEs, most frequently these were AEs representing the 
underlying disease conditions of immunosuppression and hematologic malignancy requiring treatment. 
The high frequency of co-morbid conditions impedes the ability to identify drug-associated toxicity 
when considering the overall AE profile. Therefore, an evaluation of drug-related AEs is useful in 
identifying and comparing drug-associated toxicities between the study treatment. 
Overall, drug-related AEs were less frequently reported with POS treatment than with VOR treatment 
(29.9% vs 40.1% respectively). With regard to specific categories of drug-related AEs, visual and 
psychiatric disorders were more common with VOR treatment, while hypokalaemia was more common 
with POS treatment. Comparable rates of gastrointestinal disorders and hepatic disorders were 
reported across the treatment groups. In addition to the higher rates of drug-related visual and 
psychiatric AEs among VOR-treated subjects, there was also a higher rate of discontinuation of VOR-
treated than POS-treated subjects due to drug-related AEs overall. The lack of tolerance to VOR has 
been previously reported to limit the ability to complete a necessary course of antifungal therapy, 
which is of concern when treating a life-threatening infection such as IA. The safety findings for P069 
are similar to those reported in the prior comparative study of ISA vs. VOR where VOR-treated 
subjects had higher rates of drug-related visual and psychiatric AEs, with a rate similar to those 
reported in this study. 
Overall, POS exposure in this study, as measured by trough plasma concentration, was within the 
range observed in prior clinical trials of POS IV and tablet. In a prior study of POS IV 300 mg QD (BID 
on Day 1), POS IV administration resulted in a mean trough concentration of 1320 ng/mL at steady 
state. In a similar study, POS tablet 300 mg QD (BID on Day 1) resulted in a mean trough 
concentration of 1720 ng/mL at steady state. In the current study, POS plasma trough concentrations 
were higher throughout the course of study treatment in subjects who received POS exclusively via IV 
Assessment report

administration. This difference may be attributed, at least in part, to differences in bioavailability 
between formulations (tablet bioavailability 54% under fasting conditions. It may also reflect that 
subjects who remained on IV were more seriously ill and unable to transition to an oral formulation 
since a similar trend (higher IV concentration) was observed for VOR, which has high oral 
bioavailability (96%). With regard to an evaluation of the effect of food on POS tablet absorption, the 
modest (15% to 39%, depending on time point) increase in POS exposure when POS tablets were 
administered with a meal versus fasting is not considered to be clinically meaningful. A detailed 
comparison of POS exposure across studies based on a population PK analysis will be reported 
separately. 
Exposure-safety relationships of POS by quartile of exposure were evaluated for all AEs as well as for 
drug-related AEs. While there was no relationship between exposure and the incidence of reported AEs 
overall (regardless of investigator-reported relationship), an association was seen between higher 
exposure (top quartile of exposure) and the incidence of drug-related AEs. This association has not 
been noted in prior studies of POS IV or tablet in which similar or higher exposures have been 
achieved. Similarly, with POS oral suspension, no exposure-safety adverse relationship has been 
noted, although exposures with the oral suspension are generally lower than those achieved with the 
IV or tablet formulations. A potential contributing factor to the observed association in the current 
study is that a larger proportion of subjects who were more seriously ill were likely to have been 
receiving the IV formulation rather than the tablet formulation, and thus would likely have had higher 
exposures. Furthermore, the severity of their illness would have led to a higher incidence of AEs. No 
association between POS exposure and Tier 1 AEs, and no relevant effect on QTc at the time of Cmax, 
was seen. Overall, the safety profile of POS IV and tablet in P069 was similar to that reported in POS 
product labelling of POS IV, tablet, and oral suspension. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
POS is generally well tolerated, with fewer drug-related AEs in POS-treated than in VOR-treated 
subjects. The overall AE profile of POS-treated subjects in P069 is consistent with the safety profile 
established in current product labelling of POS IV and tablet and periodic safety reporting for POS IV 
and tablet. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

uremic syndrome’, ‘Torsade de Pointes/QTc prolongation’, ‘Drug interaction’, ‘Adrenal Insufficiency’ and 
‘Hypokalaemia’ as identified risks that are not considered important for inclusion in the RMP, in 
accordance with GVP Module V (Rev 2), and therefore to remove from the list of safety concerns. The

rationales (summarized) for the proposed changes to the list of safety concerns are briefly presented 
below. 
The MAH proposes to reclassify the important potential risks ‘Heart failure’, ‘Myocardial infarction’, 
‘Convulsion’, ‘Pulmonary haemorrhage’, ‘Hypertension’, ‘Venous thrombosis’, ‘Photopsia’, ‘Visual 
brightness’ and ‘Visual disturbances’ as potential risks that are not considered important for inclusion 
in the RMP, therefore to remove from the list of safety concerns. The rationales (summarized) for the 
proposed changes to the list of safety concerns are briefly presented below. 
The MAH proposes to remove the Missing Information ‘Use in patients with hepatic impairment’ 
based on the completion of Study PN069. The rationales (summarized) for the proposed changes to 
the list of safety concerns are briefly presented below. 
Important Identified Risks removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
Elevated liver enzymes; Hepatotoxicity, Hepatic failure, Hepatitis 
Elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure and hepatitis have been removed from the list 
of Important Identified Risks. No new safety concerns related to elevated liver enzymes, 
hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure and hepatitis have been identified in the recently completed IA 
treatment study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative postmarketing data through 01-Feb-2020. 
No additional PV activities are ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and the risk 
is mitigated by routine risk minimization measures provided in the Product Information including the 
recommendation for liver function monitoring in the Special warnings and precautions of the SmPC and 
as an adverse reaction seen in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under Undesirable effects in the 
SmPC.  
Since routine PV activities and routine risk minimization measures are considered to be sufficient to 
support a favourable benefit-risk profile, no new clinical studies will be performed to further 
characterise this identified risk. Therefore, elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure and 
hepatitis have been removed from the list of Important Identified Risks. The MAH will continue to 
monitor elevated liver enzymes, hepatotoxicity, hepatic failure and hepatitis through routine PV. 
Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uremic syndrome have been removed from the 
list of Important Identified Risks. No new safety concerns related to thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura and haemolytic uremic syndrome have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment 
study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative postmarketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No 
additional PV activities are ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV 
activities support a favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization 
activities that are provided in the Product Information, which lists thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura and haemolytic uremic syndrome as rare adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or 
post-marketing use in the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No additional risk minimization 
activities are planned as these routine measures are considered to be sufficient. No further clinical 
trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this identified risk. 
Therefore, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uremic syndrome have been removed 
from the list of Important Identified Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uremic syndrome through routine PV.  
Torsade de Pointes and QTc prolongation 
Torsade de Pointes and QTc prolongation have been removed from the list of Important Identified 
Risks.  No new safety concerns related to torsade de pointes and QTc prolongation have been identified

in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative postmarketing 
data through 01-Feb-2020.  No additional PV activities are ongoing or planned as the risk has been 
well-characterised and routine PV activities support a favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is 
mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided in the Product Information, including 
medications that should not be co-administered with posaconazole due to increased risk of QTc 
prolongation or torsades de pointes in the Contraindications section of the SmPC, the recommendation 
to use with caution in patients with pro-arrhythmic conditions in the Special warnings and precautions 
for use section of the SmPC, and torsade de pointes and QTc prolongation as uncommon adverse 
reactions seen in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under Undesirable effects in the SmPC.  
No additional risk minimization activities are planned as these routine measures are considered to be 
sufficient. No further clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further 
characterise this identified risk. Therefore, torsade de pointes and QTc prolongation have been 
removed from the list of Important Identified Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor torsade de 
pointes and QTc prolongation through routine PV. 
Drug Interaction 
Drug interaction has been removed from the list of Important Identified Risks. No new safety concerns 
related to drug interaction have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069) 
and the review of cumulative postmarketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities are 
ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a 
favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk of drug interactions pertaining to CYP3A inhibition in particular 
is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided in the Product Information 
including information regarding medications that are contraindicated for coadministration with 
posaconazole in the Contraindications section of the SmPC and information regarding use with other 
medications metabolized by CYP3A4 under Special warnings and precautions for use in the SmPC. 
No additional risk minimization activities are planned as these routine measures are considered to be 
sufficient. No further clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further 
characterise this identified risk. Therefore, drug interaction has been removed from the list of 
Important Identified Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor drug interaction through routine PV. 
Adrenal Insufficiency 
Adrenal insufficiency has been removed from the list of Important Identified Risks.  No new safety 
concerns related to adrenal insufficiency have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment 
study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No 
additional PV activities are planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities 
support a favorable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that 
are provided in the Product Information, which lists adrenal insufficiency as an adverse reaction 
reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. 
No additional risk minimization activities are planned as these routine measures are considered to be 
sufficient. No further clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further 
characterize this identified risk. Therefore, adrenal insufficiency has been removed from the list of 
Important Identified Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor adrenal insufficiency through routine PV. 
Hypokalaemia 
Hypokalaemia has been removed from the list of Important Identified Risks.  No new safety concerns 
related to hypokalaemia have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), 
and a review of cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities are 
planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a favourable risk-

benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided in the 
Product Information, which lists hypokalaemia as a common adverse reaction reported in clinical trials 
and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No additional risk 
minimization activities are planned as these routine measures are considered to be sufficient. No 
further clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this 
identified risk. Therefore, hypokalaemia has been removed from the list of Important Identified Risks. 
The MAH will continue to monitor hypokalaemia through routine PV. 
Important Potential Risks removed from the List of Safety Concerns 
Heart failure 
Heart failure has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. No new safety concerns 
related to heart failure have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), and 
a review of the cumulative postmarketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities are 
planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a favourable risk-
benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided in the 
Product Information, which lists heart failure as a rare adverse reaction reported in clinical trials and/or 
post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No additional risk minimization 
activities are planned as routine measures are considered to be sufficient. No further clinical trials or 
non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this potential risk. Therefore, heart 
failure has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor 
heart failure through routine PV. 
Myocardial Infarction 
Myocardial Infarction has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. No new safety 
concerns related to myocardial infarction have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment 
study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No 
additional PV activities are planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities 
support a favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities 
that are provided in the Product Information, which lists myocardial infarction as a rare adverse 
reaction reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of 
the SmPC. No additional risk minimization activities are planned as routine measures are considered to 
be sufficient. No clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterize 
this potential risk. Therefore, myocardial infarction has been removed from the list of Important 
Potential Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor myocardial infarction through routine PV. 
Convulsion 
Convulsion has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. No new safety concerns 
related to convulsion have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), and a 
review of the cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities are 
ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a 
favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are 
provided in the Product Information, which lists convulsion as an uncommon adverse reaction reported 
in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No 
additional risk minimization activities are planned as routine measures are considered to be sufficient. 
No clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this potential 
risk. Therefore, convulsion has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. The MAH will

Pulmonary Haemorrhage 
Pulmonary Haemorrhage has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. A review of 
safety data from the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069) and the cumulative post-
marketing data through 01-Feb-2020 did not support the initial supposition of potential association 
between pulmonary haemorrhage and use of posaconazole. The underlying medical conditions such as 
pulmonary fungal infection and coagulopathy appear to be the more probable causes of pulmonary 
haemorrhage in patients with haematological malignancy treated with posaconazole. The MAH will 
continue to monitor reports of pulmonary haemorrhage through routine PV. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. No new safety concerns 
related to hypertension have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), 
and a review of the cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities 
are ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a 
favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are 
provided in the Product Information, which lists hypertension as a common adverse reaction reported 
in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No 
additional risk minimization activities are planned as routine measures are considered to be sufficient. 
No clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this potential 
risk. Therefore, hypertension has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. The MAH 
will continue to monitor hypertension through routine PV. 
Venous Thrombosis 
Venous Thrombosis has been removed from the list of Important Potential Risks. No new safety 
concerns related to venous thrombosis have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment 
study (PN069), and a review of the cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No 
additional PV activities are ongoing or planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV 
activities support a favourable risk-benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization 
activities provided in the Product Information, which lists venous thrombosis as a rare adverse reaction 
reported in clinical trials and/or post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. 
No additional risk minimization activities are planned as routine measures are considered to be 
sufficient. No clinical trials or non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this 
potential risk. Therefore, venous thrombosis has been removed from the list of Important Potential 
Risks. The MAH will continue to monitor venous thrombosis through routine PV. 
Photopsia, Visual Brightness and Visual Disturbances 
Photopsia, Visual Brightness, and Visual Disturbances has been removed from the list of Important 
Potential Risks. No new safety concerns related to photopsia, visual brightness, and visual disturbances 
have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), and a review of the 
cumulative post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV activities are ongoing or 
planned as the risk has been well-characterised and routine PV activities support a favourable risk-
benefit profile. The risk is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided in the 
Product Information, which lists eye disorders under adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and/or 
post-marketing use under the Undesirable effects section of the SmPC. No additional risk minimization 
activities are planned as routine measures are considered to be sufficient. No further clinical trials or 
non-interventional studies will be performed to further characterise this potential risk. Therefore,

recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), as well as a review of post-marketing data through 
01-Feb-2020. The safety concern is mitigated by routine risk minimization activities that are provided 
in the Product Information including the recommendation to exercise caution when posaconazole is 
used in patients with hepatic impairment in the Posology and method of administration, Special 
warnings and precautions for use and Pharmacokinetic properties sections of the SmPC. 
No additional PV and risk minimization activities are ongoing or planned as routine measures are 
considered to be sufficient. No new clinical studies will be performed in patients with hepatic 
impairment to further address this missing information. Therefore, use in patients with hepatic 
impairment has been removed from the list of Missing Information. The MAH will continue to monitor 
use in patients with hepatic impairment through routine PV. 
The MAH’s proposal to remove ‘Use in patients with hepatic impairment’ classified as missing 
information was endorsed. No new safety concerns related to use in patients with hepatic impairment 
have been identified in the recently completed IA treatment study (PN069), as well as a review of 
post-marketing data through 01-Feb-2020. No additional PV and risk minimization activities are 
ongoing or planned as routine measures are considered to be sufficient. No new clinical studies will be 
performed in patients with hepatic impairment to further address this missing information. Moreover, 
according to the revised GVP Module V, risks that do not need further evaluation as part of 
pharmacovigilance plan or additional risk minimisation activities are recommended to be removed from 
the list of safety concerns.

PART III 
PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN 
There are no ongoing and planned category 1-2 and 3 studies for Noxafil. As part of the routine 
pharmacovigilance activities, the Company uses event-specific questionnaires to obtain structured 
information about the following events: hepatic disease, cardiac arrhythmia, QT prolongation, adrenal 
insufficiency, seizure/convulsion, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, 
neutropenia/agranulocytosis, cerebrovascular accident, and drug adverse experience.  
The PRAC considered that routine pharmacovigilance is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks 
of the product. 
The MAH removed the PN069 study from the Other Forms of Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities for 
Safety Concerns. This is endorsed.

PART IV 
PLANS FOR POST-AUTHORISATION EFFICACY STUDIES 
There are no ongoing or proposed post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) for posaconazole. This 
was accepted by the PRAC. 
PART V 
RISK MINIMISATION MEASURES (INCLUDING EVALUATION OF THE 
EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES) 
The MAH states that routine risk minimisation activities are sufficient to manage the safety concerns of 
Noxafil. No additional risk minimisation measures are proposed. 
The PRAC considered that the proposed routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise 
the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
3.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, 6.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC were updated. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Some editorial PI adjustments were carried out to the suspension SmPC: 
The  statement  “Treatment  should  be  initiated  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  management  of  fungal 
infections or in the supportive care in the high-risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis” 
was moved in the oral formulation SmPCs so to appear at the beginning of Section 4.2, as it does in the 
IV SmPC. The following grammatical amendment to the sentence was also carried out: 
Treatment should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of fungal infections or in the 
supportive care of in the high-risk patients for which posaconazole is indicated as prophylaxis. 
As a result of QRD comments, ‘dextrose’ (not a standard term in the EU pharmacopoeia) was changed 
into ‘glucose’ to comply with the compilation of QRD decisions on use of terms, impacting Sections 6.2 
and 6.6 of the SmPC and the relevant section of the PL for the IV formulation. 
Additionally, the opportunity was taken to update to the clinical breakpoint of Candida dubliniensis in the 
Noxafil PI according to the published EUCAST clinical breakpoints. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic Context 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
IA is a serious, life-threatening disease among patients with prolonged and/or severe impairment of 
the immune system. Without the initiation of antifungal therapy, the acute mortality rate has been 
shown to exceed 85%. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of IA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 86/90 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current guidelines for the primary treatment of IA recommend early initiation of antifungal therapy 
while definitive diagnostic evaluation is in progress. Guidelines recommend VOR and/or ISA for the 
primary treatment of IA, with liposomal amphotericin B being the first alternative and POS, as well as 
echinocandins, mainly recommended for salvage treatment. Given the side effects and DDI of VOR and 
ISA, and the high underlying mortality of IA, a need exists for additional therapies that can overcome 
the limitations of currently approved IA therapies. 
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
POS is currently indicated for refractory IA or for patients with intolerance to 1st line therapy of IA. The 
extension of indication of POS for the first-line treatment of IA is based on the non-inferiority study 
P069. This study was performed in subjects with possible, probable or proven IA, and compare POS vs 
the first-line treatment VOR.  
5.2.  Favourable effects 
POS is non-inferior to VOR for the first-line treatment of adults with IA, based on the rate of all-cause 
mortality in the ITT population and the global clinical response in the FAS population (i.e. subjects with 
probable or proven IA) after 6 weeks of treatment. Likewise, non-inferiority was also observed at Week 
12. Subgroups analysis support this non-inferiority. 
In vitro data from study P069 and surveillance studies show that POS has comparable activity to VOR, 
ISA, and ITR against Aspergillus spp. 
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is no relevant efficacy data in paediatric subjects, with only 5 adolescents included in this study.  
Only 58% of the baseline IA diagnosis was probable or proven, and a non-negligible proportion of IA 
diagnosis (14%) cannot be determined at baseline by the CAC. This suggest that an undetermined 
number of subjects in this study did not actually have IA. 
When considering the mortality due to IA (according to the CAC), the results are not at the advantage 
of POS. At each time points (Day 42, Day 84 and Day 114), the mortality attributed to IA is more 
frequent in POS group (51.6%, 39.3% and 35.9%, respectively) compared to VOR group (31.3%, 28% 
and 30.4%, respectively). However, a higher number of indeterminate attributions of death is present 
in VOR group (56.3% vs 35.5% at Day 42), which could bias the estimation of the mortality due to IA. 
The mortality in Asian population is higher in POS group (16%, 10/62) than VOR group (6.7%, 4/60). 
This higher mortality rate is also observed within the FAS population (POS: 21% (9/43); VOR: 6.5% 
(3/46)). 
Surveillance studies show that NWT strains of A. fumigatus have increased in Europe since 10 years, 
reaching 4.5% of strains resistant to VOR and POS in 2018. 
5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, drug-related AEs were less frequently reported with POS treatment than with VOR treatment 
(29.9% vs 40.1% respectively). With regard to specific categories of drug-related AEs, visual and 
psychiatric disorders were more common with VOR treatment, while hypokalaemia was more common 
with POS treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/590500/2021  
Page 87/90 
 
 
 
 
Comparable rates of gastrointestinal disorders and hepatic disorders were reported across the 
treatment groups. In addition to the higher rates of drug-related visual and psychiatric AEs among 
VOR-treated subjects, there was also a higher rate of discontinuation of VOR-treated than POS-treated 
subjects due to drug-related AEs overall. 
5.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Exposure-safety relationships of POS by quartile of exposure were evaluated for all AEs as well as for 
drug-related AEs. While there was no relationship between exposure and the incidence of reported AEs 
overall (regardless of investigator-reported relationship), an association was seen between higher 
exposure (top quartile of exposure) and the incidence of drug-related AEs. This association has not 
been noted in prior studies of POS IV or tablet in which similar or higher exposures have been 
achieved. Similarly, with POS oral suspension, no exposure-safety adverse relationship has been 
noted, although exposures with the oral suspension are generally lower than those achieved with the 
IV or tablet formulations. A potential contributing factor to the observed association in the current 
study is that a larger proportion of subjects who were more seriously ill were likely to have been 
receiving the IV formulation rather than the tablet formulation, and thus would likely have had higher 
exposures.

5.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
IA is a severe disease with high level of mortality (over 85% without antifungal therapy). Study P069 
has demonstrated that POS is non-inferior to the reference VOR for the first-line treatment of IA in 
adults, with similar mortality rate (15-20%) and treatment success (45%) at 6 weeks after the 
beginning of treatment.  
The overall adverse event (AE) profile in P069 was reflective of the known AE profile of POS IV and 
tablet, as described in product labeling, and was consistent with a critically ill study population. 
Furthermore, the types and incidences of AEs, drug-related AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) in 
the POS treatment group in P069 were similar to those reported in previous clinical studies of POS IV 
and tablet despite P069 having a longer duration of treatment (average therapy duration of >60 days 
for the treatment of IA) compared with previous studies of POS IV and tablet (average therapy 
durations of <30 days in a prophylaxis setting). 
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
POS and VOR are both azole antifungals effective on the majority of strains of Aspergillus. No relevant 
efficacy difference between these treatments has been demonstrated. Safety and DDI considerations 
should be taken into account for the choice of first-line treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis.  
Considering the limited available therapeutic options and the high mortality rate of such infection, the 
benefit-risk balance for this extension of indication of POS in the first-line treatment of Invasive 
Aspergillosis in adults is considered positive. 
5.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Noxafil is positive.

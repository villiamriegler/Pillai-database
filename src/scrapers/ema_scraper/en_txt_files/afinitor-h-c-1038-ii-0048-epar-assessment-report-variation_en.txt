2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) comprise a group of neoplasms derived from peptide- and amine-
producing cells of the neuroendocrine system. They are characterised histologically by the intracellular 
presence of markers of endocrine tissue, such as chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin, and neuron-
specific enolase. NETs may be classified according to their embryological origin, as arising from the 
foregut (e.g., bronchial or gastric NET), midgut (e.g., small intestine or appendiceal NET), or hindgut 
(e.g., colon or rectal NET). NETs are broadly subcategorised into functional when they present with 
clinical symptoms due to hypersecretion of hormones or bioactive amines or nonfunctional when these 
symptoms are absent. 
The WHO staging system classifies gastroenteropancreatic NET (GEP-NET) based on primary tumour 
localization, size, mitotic activity, invasiveness, and functional status (Klöppel et al 2004). In addition, 
the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) has established a TNM staging system (Klöppel 
et al 2009). Tumour grading is based on the determination of mitotic activity of the tumour measured 
by Ki-67 staining or by counting mitotic figures. Low grade (G1) tumours show Ki-67 in ≤2%, 
intermediate grade tumours (G2) >3-20% and high grade tumours (G3) in >20% of tumour cells. Low 
and intermediate grade NETs are also referred to as well-differentiated NETs, and high grade tumours 
are referred to as poorly differentiated NETs. For tumours of thoracic (lung/thymus) origin, the WHO 
tumour grading relies on the mitotic rate or the presence and extent of necrosis. Prognosis is 
dependent primarily on stage, histologic differentiation, grading and origin. 
The main primary sites of origin for NETs are the gastrointestinal tract (62% to 67%) and the lung 
(22% to 27%). Around 40-50% of NETs are functional tumours, which are typically diagnosed due to 
the presence of specific symptoms. Nonfunctional tumours typically present with symptoms of 
advanced tumour growth (Modlin et al 2011). Overall, 40% to 60% of patients with NET are 
asymptomatic at presentation. As NETs are difficult to diagnose, approximately 40% of patients have 
advanced disease at initial presentation (Yao et al 2008), with up to 75% with liver metastases at the 
time of diagnosis. Common signs and symptoms include, but are not limited to, abdominal pain, 
intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, GI bleeding, rectal bleeding, melena, constipation, diarrhoea, 
and flushing. The variety and intensity of NET symptoms increase with tumour progression.  
Management of NETs is generally guided by the primary site, extent of disease (stage), proliferative 
index (grade), and degree of differentiation. High-grade or poorly-differentiated NETs have an 
aggressive course, and their management parallels that of small-cell lung cancer. Well- to moderately-
differentiated NETs are considered to be more indolent but are resistant to most cytotoxic agents. At 
present, surgery is the only curative treatment for NETs. For advanced NETs, therapeutic options focus 
on controlling the hormonal syndrome and inhibiting tumour growth. The somatostatin analogues 
(octreotide and lanreotide), sunitinib and everolimus have been approved in the EU for the treatment 
of neuroendocrine tumours with different sites of primary origin, grades and stages. Other treatments 
include angiogenesis inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, interferon (IFN), surgical resection 
and embolisation of hepatic metastases. Peptide receptor radiotherapy (radiolabeled therapy) 
represents an additional option available in a limited number of medical centres.  
Everolimus, a derivative of rapamycin, acts as a signal transduction inhibitor, selectively inhibiting the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key serine-threonine kinase regulating protein synthesis 
and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival. mTOR is a component in the 
PI3K/AKT /mTOR pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers. A role for everolimus 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 6/80 
 
 
 
 
in the treatment of NETs has been suggested by the regulatory role of mTOR in cell growth, 
metabolism and protein translation, coupled with the observation that the PI3K/mTOR pathway is 
activated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in NETs. IGF-1 activates the PI3K/mTOR pathway in 
pancreatic and other neuroendocrine tumour cells, is a known autocrine regulator of cell growth in 
NET, and stimulates chromogranin A (CgA) secretion. 
The MAH applied for an Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Afinitor, as follows: 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with progressive disease.  
The approved indication is 
Afinitor is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or 
Grade 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults with 
progressive disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment on the active ingredient everolimus dated 
July 2015. The ERA included a Phase I and a Phase II assessment according to the Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.  
Assessment of persistence, bioaccumulation potential and toxicity for Everolimus 
The applicant provided a value of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient for Everolimus based on a 
study report according to the OECD guideline for testing of chemicals 117. No screening for 
persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was deemed necessary since the value of LogKow is 4.0 and 
therefore below 4.5. 
The CHMP agreed that there is no need for a PBT assessment. 
Phase I Assessment 
The applicant provided an initial calculation of PECsurface water according to the Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 using a daily dose of 20mg everolimus and representing the worst 
case scenario. The calculation resulted in a value of 0.1µg/L. Therefore a phase II environmental risk 
fate and effect analysis had to be performed. 
The worst case approach of the applicant is appreciated.  Since the resulting PECsw is above the trigger 
value of 0.01µg/L a Phase II environmental fate and effect assessment has to be provided.  
Phase II Assessment Tier A 
A refined PECsw has been calculated and resulting in a value of 0.17ng/L. 
According to the guideline, the PECgroundwater was also calculated resulting in a value of 0.0425ng/L 
for everolimus.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 7/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The refinement of the PECsurface water estimated by the applicant is acceptable. The value of 0.17ng/L for 
the refined PECsw can be used for risk assessment. The PECgroundwater calculated by the applicant can 
also be used for further risk assessment. 
Physico-chemical properties and fate 
The applicant provided information on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient, adorption/desorption 
properties as well as data on ready biodegradability and aerobic and anaerobic transformation in 
aquatic sediment systems. The information can be summarized as follows:

The submitted effect studies are considered acceptable for environmental risk assessment. 
Risk characterization Phase II Tier A 
Resulting from the study on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (OECD 117) a study on 
bioaccumulation potential has to be conducted in Phase II Tier B since the Log Kow exceeds 3.0.  
According to the results of the study on Adsorption/ Desorption (OECD 106) no assessment of the 
terrestrial compartment is deemed necessary because the Koc value is below the action limit of 10 000 
L/kg. 
The study on transformation of everolimus in water-sediment systems according to guideline 
OECD 308 revealed significant partitioning of everolimus into sediments and, consequently, a risk 
assessment for the sediment compartment has to be conducted in Phase II-Tier B. 
Everolimus is considered to constitute no significant risk to microorganism’s and therefore to sewage 
treatment plants. 
Everolimus shows high chronic toxicity on growth of Daphnia magna being the most sensitive endpoint 
investigated. However, no risk could be identified for surfacewater as well as for groundwater (see 
table 3).

The applicant calculated a PECsediment based on an average of the provided Koc values in sludge and 
soil resulting in a PECsediment of 3.98 µg/kg. 
The submitted Tier B effect studies are considered acceptable for environmental risk assessment. 
The assessor calculates the PECsediment based on the highest Kd soil resulting in a slightly higher 
PECsediment of 5.13 µg/kg. 
Risk characterization Phase II Tier B 
In order to conduct the risk characterization for sediment organisms the applicant calculated a 
PNECsediment based on the NOEC for the development of the sediment-dwelling larvae of 
Chironomus riparius, normalized to standard sediment with 10% organic carbon 
content and including an assessment factor of 100, resulting in a value of 112.1 μg/kg. 
The risk ratio for sediment was calculated by the applicant as: 
PEC/PNECsediment = 3.98 μg/kg / 112.1 μg/kg = 0.0355 
It was concluded that the result indicates that everolimus does not constitute any significant risk to 
sediment compartments. 
The BCF was considered to be significantly below 500 and everolimus has therefore only a low 
potential for bioconcentration. Everolimus can therefore not be considered a PBT substance and 
therefore no further risk assessment needs to be performed (no “secondary poisoning”). 
The approach of the applicant regarding calculation of the PNECsediment by normalization to standard 
sediment is not considered acceptable. Using the PNECsediment without normalization of organic 
carbon to a content of 10%, this results in a PEC/PNECsediment as follows: 
PEC/PNECsediment = 5.13 μg/kg / 25 μg/kg = 0.21 
Both risk ratios calculated by above as well as by the applicant are below 1. Therefore it can be 
concluded that everolimus does not constitute any significant risk to sediment compartments. 
Therefore, the conclusion of the applicant that everolimus has only a low potential for bioconcentration 
is acceptable. There is no further request for assessment.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated ERA data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure further to the use of everolimus. 
 Considering the above data, everolimus is not expected to pose a risk to the environment and it is not 
considered to be a PBT substance.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
ADME 
In Study T2302 steady state trough concentrations (Cmin) of everolimus were measured. 
Methods: 
A pre-dose PK blood sample was collected in all patients by direct venipuncture prior to dosing at Visit 
3, Cycle 2 (Day 29).  
Only valid pre-dose blood samples were included in the analysis (confirmed blood samples collected at 
steady-state, collected immediately prior to dosing on the same study day, and collected at 
approximately 24 ± 4 hours after the previous dose and with no vomiting within the first 4 hours 
following the last dose). 
Results: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 12/80 
 
 
 
 
127 pre-dose blood samples were collected from 132 patients in the everolimus arm. Of the 127 pre-
dose samples, 126 pre-dose samples had non-missing values. Of these 126 pre-dose samples with 
non-missing values, 33 were collected in the wrong matrix (plasma) and were discarded. Of the 
remaining 93 samples, 51 were analysed and produced confirmed Cmin data that were used for PK 
analysis. Of these 51 patients, 3 had reduced the dose to 5 mg. 
Assessment of pharmacokinetics was introduced into the study protocol with Amendment 1, CSP 
version v01, dated 06-06-2012, after only one patient had been randomised. A single pre-dose steady-
state PK sample was planned at D29 per patient. Although the CSP explicitly stated several times that 
whole blood was to be taken for PK measurements and advice on collection, handling and shipment for 
the samples was included, one fourth of the samples had to be discarded due to collection of the wrong 
matrix (plasma).  
Finally only 51 of 93 samples were analysed for Cmin results. Some full blood samples were not 
included in the analysis because the previous everolimus dose had not been taken 24±4 hours before 
blood sampling; but according to CSR other samples drawn during this time period were neither 
analysed; it was unclear why the other 42 samples were excluded and if this produced any bias in the 
data. It also remained unclear from the submitted documentation why overall only 132 patients 
provided samples although 202 patients were enrolled in the everolimus arm and there was no 
separate informed consent to be signed for patients being PK sampled or not. In their responses to 1st 
RSI the MAH clarified reasons for the low sample size with e.g., unscheduled sampling, enrolment prior 
to amendment 1, discontinuation prior to sampling visit, lost samples during shipment. 
Furthermore, the bioanalytical data report DMPK RCRAD001T2302 states that PK samples were taken 
on day “77 in addition to day 29” with a total number of 102 patients. This could not be verified from 
the CSP or other documentation. The MAH clarified that “day 77” referred to an unscheduled blood 
sampling. 
Summary statistics of everolimus after the 10 mg daily dose are provided in Table 6. Listed in this 
table are also the summary statistics of everolimus Cmin after a 5 mg daily dose which was required for 
a number of patients in the study experiencing AEs requiring dose modifications.

Cmin was further analysed by subgroups of gender, race and tumour origin. 
There was no apparent difference in Cmin between male and female patients considering the high inter-
subject variability of the Cmin values in both male and female patients. 
Also,  there  was  no  apparent  difference  in  Cmin  among  Caucasian,  Japanese,  and  Asian  patients 
considering the high inter-subject variability in all subgroups.

Pre-planned subgroup analyses demonstrated a consistent positive treatment effect across major 
demographic and prognostic subgroups, although numerical differences were evident for some 
subgroups, including ileum as the primary site of tumour origin (see efficacy assessment below). 
Considering the high inter-subject variability of the mean everolimus Cmin values in both subgroups no 
obvious difference after the 10 mg daily dose was measured. 
Steady state pre-dose concentrations obtained from sparse sampling from 48 GI and lung NET-patients 
receiving 10 mg everolimus and 3 patients receiving the reduced dose of 5 mg daily in the pivotal 
study were generally consistent with previous data in patients with solid tumours (phase I), renal cell 
carcinoma, pNET and breast cancer. Geometric mean Cmin after 10 mg was 12.8 ng/ml with a 
variation coefficient of 79.1%, and for the 5 mg dose 3.73 ng/ml with CV 101%. 
Inter-subject variability for Cmin was generally high with CV up to 90% for reasonable group sizes. 
Special populations 
No new information on PK in special populations was generated in support of this application. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interaction study was performed. 
From study T2302, no difference was evidenced between everolimus Cmin values under co-
administration of CYP3A4 and/or PgP substrates (mean ± SD = 23.2 ± 20.1 ng/mL [n=10]) and the 
everolimus Cmin observed in all patients with valid Cmin values (mean ± SD = 16.4 ± 13.3 ng/mL 
[n=48]) after the 10 mg daily dose. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Exposure-response relationship 
The relationship between everolimus exposure and PFS was investigated by fitting a Cox regression 
model for patients with confirmed everolimus C min data. The model included prior SSA treatment, 
tumour origin and baseline WHO performance status as strata and time-normalized everolimus Cmin as 
a covariate. Results of the Cox model suggested a trend of longer PFS with a two-fold increase in 
everolimus Cmin value (HR = 0.898 [95% CI: 0.586, 1.374]. As the result was not statistically 
significant no definitive conclusion can be drawn. The results are not interpretable due to small 
event/patient numbers in the higher Cmin category and the fact that stratification factors were not 
taken into consideration in the analysis. 
Among the 49 patients with confirmed everolimus Cmin data, there was no statistically significant 
relationship between percent change in sum of longest diameter of all target lesions and time-
normalized everolimus Cmin. However, a marginal generalized linear mixed model analysis showed that 
everolimus Cmin was related to the probability of tumour size reduction (parameter estimate for ln-
Cmin=0.663; p=0.0005) with an odds ratio of 1.58 [95% CI: 1.23, 2.04] for a two-fold increase in 
Cmin. 
The relationships between change from baseline in the biomarkers (CgA and NSE) and time-normalized 
Cmin were not statistically significant. 
No statistically relevant results for an exposure-response relationship were observed in this patient 
population.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 14/80 
 
 
 
 
Trends for a probability of longer PFS and target lesion size reduction with a 2-fold increase of Cmin 
were calculated; however, these calculations are based on a very small sample number (a quarter of 
the everolimus treated patients in the pivotal study) and hence have to be interpreted with caution.  
On the other hand, the Kaplan-Meier Plot for PFS by Cmin subgroups might also be interpreted as that 
patients with dose reductions have been benefitted more over time than those with exposures in the 
most common range. 
Exposure-safety relationship 
The relationship between everolimus exposure and selected clinically notable AEs (stomatitis, non-
infectious pneumonitis and infections) was investigated by running three separate Cox regression 
analysis models each having time-normalized everolimus Cmin as a single covariate and time-to-first AE 
as an outcome variable (Table 7). Results indicated that there was no evidence of a relationship 
between increasing time-normalized everolimus Cmin with increased risk of clinically notable AEs within 
the Cmin range evaluated.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
For the underlying application of a new indication for everolimus in the population with GI and lung 
neuroendocrine tumours no self-standing clinical pharmacology studies were performed. During the 
pivotal study sparse sampling for pharmacokinetics was performed to obtain steady state trough 
concentrations from one blood sampling at day 29.  
It is noted that, although 202 patients have been treated with everolimus – of which 13 had taken the 
study medication for less than 4 weeks and were therefore not evaluable at day 29-PK sampling –, 
blood samples from only 132 patients were obtained, 91 samples were received by the lab and finally 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 15/80 
 
 
 
 
   
only 51 patients were (considered) evaluable for Cmin calculation. This questions the quality of study 
training for the site personnel by the sponsor, the communication strategy between PK lab and sponsor 
and the selection of evaluable blood samples. 
From the (few) samples finally analysed for Cmin it is concluded that mean pre-dose trough 
concentrations of both 10 mg and 5 mg everolimus obtained at steady state on D29 were in the same 
range as previously measured in other cancer entities. In general, everolimus Cmin showed a broad 
inter-subject variability (approx. 81%), which also confirmed earlier observations. Subgroup analyses 
according to gender, ethnicity and CYP3A and/or PgP inhibitor intake did not reveal differences 
between groups, under consideration of the partially very small groups (1-3 patients) and the high 
variability (about 90% CV in reasonably large subgroups). However, trough concentrations of only 
about two third of the respective other group was measured when comparing samples of stratum A 
with stratum B and tumour origin ileum with other tumour origins. 
The MAH stated that no apparent differences in mean trough concentrations were observed between 
genders, ethnicities or tumour origins, considering the high variability. This was not fully agreed with. 
As evident from the MAH’s responses to 1st RSI, the geo-mean Cmin levels for the ileum subgroup are 
only slightly lower than those seen in the pancreatic NET study C2324. The comparison of everolimus 
trough levels between different tumour entities as obtained from phase III studies shows that the 
geometric mean Cmin in the studied populations varied between 11.1-16.5ng/ml with moderate to high 
variation coefficients of 53.6-109.5%. The Cmin of the total GI/lung NET population in study T2302 of 
12.8ng/ml is fully in this range. Also the variability of 79% in the new population is in the same 
moderate to high range than observed in earlier populations. It is concluded that the dose of 10mg 
seems adequate also for the GI/lung NET population. 
Whether full or partial resection of the small intestine might have had an influence on the absorption of 
everolimus cannot be revealed as the available small number of patient samples is too low. 
Exposure-response relationship was investigated. While most variables did not show a relationship with 
exposure, as measured by Cmin, a trend for a relation for PFS and reduction of sum of lesion 
diameters with 2-fold increase of Cmin was suggested. However, due to the small sample numbers, 
these results have to be interpreted with caution, also in view of the Kaplan-Meier curve shapes for 
PFS by Cmin subgroups.  
An exposure-safety relationship for the most clinically notable ADRs stomatitis, non-infectious 
pneumonitis and infection could not be determined. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the geometric mean trough plasma levels of everolimus showed a moderate to high 
variability.  Although within this study the ileum group had a Cmin of only 77% of the non-ileum group 
and stratum A only had 66% of stratum B, no reliable conclusion can be drawn from these trough 
level-differences in relation to PFS.  
Whether full or partial resection of the small intestine might have had an influence on the absorption of 
everolimus can neither be revealed as the available small number of patient samples is too low. 
In conclusion, from the new pharmacology results no clinically relevant new information was obtained.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PFS as per central radiology, evaluated per modified RECIST 1.0 as defined in the 
CSP (see below). PFS as per local Investigator review was supportive. The primary analysis for PFS 
was performed on the FAS and compares the distribution of PFS between the two treatment groups 
using a stratified log-rank test at one-sided 2.5% level of significance. 
Key secondary endpoint: OS. Tested between the 2 treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test in 
a hierarchal way when PFS was found significant. A group sequential methodology with alpha-spending 
function was implemented for OS testing to maintain the family-wise error rate. 
Other secondary endpoints:  
- Safety and tolerability: mainly based on AEs and laboratory values out of pre-determined ranges 
- ORR and DCR: as per modified RECIST 1.0 as defined in the CSP and according to central evaluation 
- HRQoL: based on time to definitive deterioration in FACT-G total score, where deterioration is defined 
as a decrease by at least 7 points compared to baseline 
- Changes in CgA and NSE levels  
- Time to deterioration of WHO performance status: defined as an increase of at least one category 
compared to baseline. 
Modified RECIST 1.0 was defined in the CSP as to guide the declaration of disease progression (1) 
based on new “unequivocal” liver lesions, i.e. single lesions with a size of ≥10mm or multiple new 
lesions of <10mm at one evaluation, and (2) based on non-target lesions with an overall level of 
substantial worsening of the non-target disease which requires treatment discontinuation, even in case 
of SD or PR of the target-disease. 
Independent central review of routine local tumour assessment was conducted by image submission 
from site to imaging CRO within 48 hours and timely reading. In cases of investigator assessed disease 
progression, an expedited IRC review was to be requested and central review by radiologist was to be 
performed within 5 working days to minimize bias. Until progression was confirmed by the IRC the 
patient was to continue treatment, if indicated. IRC-confirmed progression should result in treatment 
discontinuation. 
Sample size 
Sample size assumptions in this study were partly based on the data from the PROMID study. The 
median PFS in the placebo arm was expected to be around 5 months. This was lower than the TTP of 6 
months observed in the control arm of the PROMID study due to the differences in patient population, 
endpoint, and treatment line, as a retrospective case series in patients with more advanced NET had 
shown a median TTP after 2nd line therapy of 5 months. It was hypothesized that treatment with 
everolimus resulted in a 41% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to 70% increase in the 
median PFS to 8.5 months). 
PFS analysis was to be performed when a total of 176 PFS events were observed. Assuming about 
15% of the patients were drop-outs for the PFS evaluation, a total of 285 patients was planned to be 
randomized between the two study arms in a 2:1 ratio (190 in everolimus arm and 95 in placebo arm).

Please also see Statistical methods below. 
Randomisation 
Prior to dosing, all patients who fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized via IRT to 
one of the treatment arms. 302 patients were randomised in a 2:1 manner and were included in the 
FAS.  Randomization was stratified by: 
1. prior SSA treatment (yes vs. no; the SSA pretreated stratum is defined as patients who had 
continuously received SSA for ≥12 weeks any time prior to study inclusion),  
2. tumour origin (A. appendix, caecum, jejunum, ileum, duodenum, CUP  vs.   
       B. lung, stomach, rectum, colon except caecum),  
CUP was defined as well differentiated (G1 or G2) NET where any other primary tumour origin than 
gastrointestinal or lung has been excluded by appropriate diagnostic procedures. As with 
Amendment 1 “liver” as primary tumour site was deleted from stratum B, NET lesions found solely 
in the liver were coded as CUP. 
3. WHO performance status (0 vs. 1). 
The strata A and B according to tumour site of origin were based on median survival data of the 
primary tumour origins as referred to from Yao et al. 2008. 
A summary of the classification of NETs as provided in the study protocol is given in Table 8 below:

This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Progression-free survival was the primary efficacy endpoint and was defined as the time from the date 
of randomization to the date of first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause. 
Disease progression was based on the tumour assessment by the central radiological assessment using 
modified RECIST 1.0 criteria. If a patient did not progress or was not known to have died at the date of 
the analysis cut-off or start of another antineoplastic therapy, the PFS date was censored to the date 
of last adequate tumour assessment prior to cut-off date or start of antineoplastic therapy.  
PFS analysis was to be performed when a total of 176 PFS events were observed. Under the 
alternative hypothesis of a HR=0.59 and with this number of PFS events, the test of the null 
hypothesis H0: true HR=1 had 91.3% power using a one-sided log-rank test. The median PFS in the 
placebo arm was expected to be around 5 months and in everolimus arm around 8.5 months. PFS was 
censored at the last adequate tumour assessment if one of the following occurred: 
The event occurred after a new anticancer therapy was given  
•  No event (i.e., progression or death prior to progression) is observed up to the cut-off date  
• 
• 
•  Discontinuation of study treatment (for any reason) was not considered as a reason for 
The event occurred after ≥ 2 missing tumour assessments 
censoring.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report

The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the distribution of PFS between the two treatment 
groups in the FAS using a stratified log-rank test at one-sided 2.5% cumulative level of significance 
(strata information according to randomization). Distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method. The number of ties in the analysis of PFS, (events recorded with exactly the same 
times), was expected to be rather large due to the discrete tumour/HRQoL/WHO assessment scheme. 
In the SAS PHREG procedure, the Breslow approximation was avoided since it performs poorly and the 
STRATA statement in LIFETEST procedure was used instead. The stratified Cox regression with 
treatment as a single covariate was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of PFS, along with 95% 
confidence interval. Overall survival was identified as the key secondary endpoint. Cox proportional 
hazards model will be implemented using PHREG procedure with option TIES=EXACT. It assumes that 
there is a true but unknown ordering for the tied event times 
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a 
death was not observed by the date of analysis cutoff, then OS was censored at the date of last 
contact. The OS analysis was performed in the FAS. The distribution of OS was compared between the 
two treatment groups using a group sequential design with a stratified log-rank test, 3 looks (Lan-
DeMets group sequential design with O’Brien- Fleming type boundaries) at one-sided cumulative 2.5% 
level of significance. The distribution function of OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The median OS along with 95% confidence intervals was presented by two treatment groups. The 
stratified Cox regression was used to estimate HR of OS, along with 95% confidence interval. 
Interim analyses for PFS and OS were planned and the interim analysis plan was revised twice. First, in 
order to have more mature data and to decrease the risk of bias in the estimation of the PFS hazard 
ratio, the timing of the interim analysis was changed from 60% (102 events) to 80% (140 events) of 
the total number of targeted PFS events. This change also impacted the total number of required PFS 
events and the total sample size. Second, due to the rapid enrolment, the DMC meeting for the interim 
efficacy analysis (at 80% of the events) was predicted to occur when the number of events (N=176) 
for the final PFS analysis was already observed. Therefore, the interim analysis for PFS was cancelled. 
The DMC and the Steering Committees agreed with the recommendation to cancel the interim analysis 
for PFS. Two interim analyses were planned for OS, one at the time of PFS interim analysis and one at 
the time of PFS final analysis. Due to the cancelation of the PFS interim analysis, the first of the 
planned interim analyses for OS was cancelled and replaced by a later interim analysis at 50% of the 
final OS events (at approximately 95 OS events). The final OS analysis is expected 90 months after 
FPFV. 
The type I error was controlled for the primary endpoint PFS and the key secondary endpoint OS 
using a hierarchical approach where OS was to be tested if the PFS results were significant. For the 
OS analyses a Lan-DeMets group sequential design with O’Brien- Fleming type boundaries was used 
with three analysis time points defined. 
Several analyses were performed that confirm the results of the primary efficacy analysis for PFS and 
there are no concerns about the robustness of the results. Results based on investigator radiology 
review are very similar. Censoring patterns between the arms are comparable and censoring due to 
initiation of a new cancer therapy occurred with the same frequency in the arms. The impact of 
missing scans was explored with two sensitivity analyses using backdated events and actual event 
time. Both types of analysis yield very similar results. 
The additional analyses performed for subgroups are welcomed to further explore results with 
differing treatment effects in subgroups. Some subgroup results could suggest differences in 
treatment effects, but from a statistical perspective there are arguments that support the view that 
the subgroups results could be due to chance. Stratified randomization can balance allocation to the 
treatment arms in subgroups with factors used for stratification, but does not guarantee balance for

other factors with small numbers in the treatment arms. Differences between analyses with and 
without stratification in certain subgroups suggest that there is an imbalance for the factors used for 
stratified randomization, influencing the subgroups analysis. Smaller hazard ratios in analyses using 
additional covariates for the analyses of primary tumour origin subgroups (which include the ileum 
subgroup) also suggest confounding by other factors. 
The results in the subgroups analysis by tumour origin are of special interest due to the differing 
results in the ileum subgroup. Due to fewer events in this subgroup the confidence intervals are wider 
than for other tumour origin subgroups. While the Gail-Simon test (ileum subgroup vs. other origins) 
indicates no qualitative interaction and therefore no concern arises, it has to be considered that this 
test has only limited power.  
Results 
Participant flow 
As of data cut-off of 28 Nov 2014, a total of 302 patients were enrolled in study T2302. Two patients 
randomized to everolimus were not treated due to withdrawal of consent and protocol deviation and 
one patient randomized to everolimus received placebo treatment by mistake.

Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended two times during  the conduct of the study. Relevant changes are 
described below. 
Amendment 1 (issued 06-Jun-2012)  
As of 10-May-2012, one patient had been randomized. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 24/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Liver” as primary tumour site was deleted from stratum B. This rationale was based on clinical 
observation that most, if not all, liver NET are metastases of other primary NET locations (although in 
some patients no primary NET outside the liver can be detected). Therefore, NET lesions found solely 
in the liver were to be coded as “Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP)”, which was included in 
stratum A. 
Interval from time of last radiological progression to randomization was increased from 3 to 6 months 
to better align with current standard of care, which was generally to scan patients every six months (to 
facilitate recruitment). 
A single pre-dose PK blood sample was integrated at pre-dose Visit 3, Cycle 2, Day 29. 
The timing of the interim analysis was changed from 60% (102 events) to 80% (140 events) of the 
total number of targeted PFS events. This change also impacted the total number of required PFS 
events and the total sample size. 
Exclusion 15 was modified to also allow patients with curatively resected other prior tumours if they 
were in complete remission for >5 years (to increase recruitment). 
For a new lesion to be unequivocal, the progression date was established when the new lesion reached 
a size ≥10 mm.  
Amendment 2 (issued 28-Jan-2014) 
At the time of this protocol amendment, all patients (N=302) were randomized as planned. As of 21-
Jan-2014, 123 patients were still receiving treatment. 
Due to the rapid enrolment, the DMC meeting for the interim efficacy analysis (at 80% of the events) 
was predicted to occur when the number of events (N=176) for the final PFS analysis was already 
observed. Therefore, the interim analysis for PFS was cancelled. 
Two interim analyses were planned for OS: one at the time of PFS interim analysis and one at the time 
of PFS final analysis. Due to the cancelation of the PFS interim analysis, the first of the planned interim 
analyses for OS was cancelled and replaced by a later interim analysis at 50% of the final OS events 
(at approximately 95 OS events). Final OS analysis is expected 90 months after FPFV. 
Also, OS was a pre-specified key secondary endpoint in this study. The process of unblinding and 
communication of interim OS results between the sponsor, Health Authorities, and other parties was 
revised. Protocol Amendment 2 clarified that Novartis will be performing the OS Interim Analysis at the 
time of PFS analysis in order to facilitate Health Authority interactions on the basis of past discussions 
and feedback from Health Authorities on other trials conducted by Novartis. Therefore, at the time of 
final PFS analysis, the clinical and statistical teams within Novartis had access to the unblinded OS 
data and the interim OS results and will share these data with Health Authorities and other parties as 
needed. Patients and Investigators remained blinded to study treatment until final OS analysis (or 
earlier if OS reached statistical significance at any of the interim analyses) unless the Sponsor deems 
unblinding of patients and Investigators appropriate. 
Concerning the interim analyses please also refer to the statistical methods above. 
•  Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations led to the exclusion from the Per Protocol set of 4 patients from the 
everolimus arm and 1 patient from the placebo arm.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 25/80 
 
 
 
 
Table 12 
Major protocol deviations (FAS) 
Minor protocol deviations were primarily ’Incorrect stratification factor used for randomization’ (~14% 
both arms), ‘No radiological documentation of disease progression within 3/6 months prior to 
randomization’ (5% only everolimus arm), ‘Study drug interrupted for more than 4 weeks but study 
drug not discontinued’ and ‘Missing pregnancy test’ (both ~3% both arms). 
Reported data on randomization based on wrong stratification factors were as follows: numbers were 
low for WHO performance status and tumour origin (0-7 of all 302 patients with 0-4 per stratum). Prior 
use of SSA was incorrectly given at randomization for 17 and 9/302 patients, of which in the 
everolimus arm 14 patients were randomized as “SSA= yes” but had none before and 7 randomized to 
“SSA=no” but were pretreated.  
•  GCP Audits and inspections 
5 investigator sites (2x Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, US) were audited by the sponsor during conduct 
of the study (Mar 2013 – Aug 2014). There were no known Health Authority inspections conducted at 
sites participating in this study. 
The MAH was asked to provide information on the results of the internal GCP site audits and clarified 
that they did not reveal relevant GCP issues that could have impacted the conduct of the study 
Baseline data 
•  Baseline Demographics 
The median age of all patients was 63 years (range: 22 to 86 years) (Table 13). Overall, the two 
treatment arms were well balanced with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics. Except, 
patients in the everolimus arm were slightly older (65 years, range: 22 to 86 years) than the patients 
in the placebo arm (60 years, range: 24 to 83 years). Further, a higher percentage of females were 
seen in the everolimus arm (56.6% vs. 45.4%) and also a higher percentage of Caucasians (79.0% vs. 
70.1%).

Despite slight imbalances were evident for age, gender and race, other baseline demographics were 
well balanced between the treatment arms. A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint addressing 
these imbalances was performed.  
No imbalances are likely to favour the experimental arm.

Primary site of tumour origin was lung with about 30% of patients, followed by ileum with about one 
quarter and rectum and CUP of 12-13% of patients in both treatment arms. In view of the respective 
inclusion criteria, the proportion of patients with lung NET was higher than in both previous everolimus 
studies (pNET C2324: 14% as involved organ; carcinoid C2325: 5 and 15% as primary site). 
The majority of tumours were of grade 1. According to tumour staging, nearly 95% had stage IV 
(metastatic) disease and only 3% with stage III. 40% of patients had their primary diagnosis more 
than 3 years ago. The latter is in accordance with grade 1 and 2 well-differentiated NETs often 
progressing slowly.  
One patient was included in the placebo arm with a proliferation index of grade 3, and likewise were 3 
patients in the everolimus arm. The MAH stated that these patients were retained in the study and 
were not considered to be protocol deviations based on the investigators’ confirmation of eligibility. 
There were a high number of patients (FAS: everolimus arm 49.3%; placebo arm 40.2%) for whom no 
histological grading was done at screening, although the inclusion criterion 1 required pathologically 
confirmed disease and the CSP requested that “the tumor pathology report should be verified and 
should confirm histology and grade of neuroendocrine tumor”. It was clarified that all of the patients 
without a ‘histologic grade’ were assessed per WHO tumour grading, or vice versa. 
However, additional discrepancies appeared between tumour grading and Ki-67/mitotic index, e.g., 79 
patients documented with tumour grade 1 had a Ki67-index or mitotic count of grade 2. 34 patients 
had no Ki-67/MI parameters obtained at baseline. Therefore the MAH was requested to perform new 
PFS analyses accounting for the correct(ed) tumour grade and discuss the predictive value of Ki-
67/mitotic index for everolimus treatment.  
An almost equal proportion of patients had one, two, or more than two organs involved in their disease 
(Table 15).

In nearly 80% of patients liver was the involved organ, other very frequently involved organs were 
lymph nodes (about 40%), lung and bones (about 20%). These metastatic disease states underline 
the fact that (asymptomatic) NETs, i.e. without carcinoid syndrome or specific symptoms, are often 
diagnosed only in an advanced stage. 
According to tumour staging in table 14 above, nearly 95% had stage IV disease, which is defined as 
distant metastatic including non-local lymph nodes (M1), independent of any tumour localisation, size 
and infiltration (T) and involvement of lymph nodes (N) (acc. to ENETS and AJCC). But, according to 
the RECIST table, 34% of patients had only 1 organ involved. The MAH clarified that table 15 refers to 
lesions selected for RECIST per central reviewer, i.e., lesions selected as suitable for accurate repeated

measurements. In addition, most patients had their primary lesion resected, thus, it is expected that 
many patients would be enrolled with a single metastatic site. 
Prior antineoplastic therapy (FAS) is listed in Table 16. Moderate imbalance on prior surgery (59.0% 
vs. 72.2%) was probably secondary to the broad definition used for this category, including endoscopic 
procedures, which were reported at a higher incidence in the placebo group. No evidence was found 
suggesting a differential frequency of surgical procedures between the two arms that might be of 
prognostic value.

¹ Patients could have been exposed to more than one type of somatostatin analogues. 
² Prior exposure to SSA, in months, is derived as (the last known date SSA was given - the first known date SSA was given +1) 
divided by 30.4375. 
Source: [Study T2302-Table 14.1-3.9] 
Pretreatment was balanced between both arms. About 80% of the study patients had any prior 
antineoplastic therapy, including surgery and radiotherapy. About a quarter of the patients had 
received prior chemotherapy. 54% had prior somatostatin analogues, mainly up to 2 years. 
In view of this study having investigated everolimus or placebo in addition to BSC, the MAH was 
requested to provide details of concomitant BSC in both arms. In the studied population BSC was 
needed mainly for control of everolimus-related side effects: 91 vs. 78% of patients received BSC in 
the everolimus and placebo groups, respectively. Most differences were seen for BSC of electrolyte 
solutions (+18.2% relative to placebo), solutions affecting electrolyte imbalance (+17.7%), anilides 
(+14.7%), homeopathic preparations (+13.0%), anti-inflammatory preparations (non-steroids for 
topical use) (+12.3%), non-drug therapies and procedures (+11.9%), opium alkaloids and derivatives 
(+10.2%), and salt solutions (+10.1%), higher in the everolimus group compared to placebo. None of 
these imbalances was expected to have influenced the primary efficacy endpoint. Moreless none of the 
ATC classes of BSC was used at higher frequencies in the placebo group, except e.g. “osmotically 
active laxative drugs” (15.5 vs. 11.2%) or “other drugs for functional GI disorders” like dimeticone 
(5.2 vs. 2.4%). For such ATC codes, the percental differences were marginal. 
Overall, the study population is considered representing the target population. 
•  Treatment compliance 
Compliance to treatment was recorded in the Drug Accountability Forms. No formal measurement of 
plasma concentrations for evaluation of treatment compliance was performed.   
The MAH clarified in their response to 1st RSI that unintended dose interruptions occurred in 20% of 
the cases, however, mainly of short duration of median 1 day. Consequently, the impact on the 
relative dose intensity was low.

Stratified HR refers to adjustment for the stratification factors used in the trial (WHO PS, primary 
tumour location, prior use of SSA).  
These adjustments resulted in surprisingly large changes: Caucasians (HR 0.83 to 0.56) and males (HR 
0.78 to 0.52).  
Even after adjustment for covariates and stratification factors, PFS remained above 1 (1.34 to 1.01) 
for the ileum subgroup.

Ileum vs. non-ileum subgroups 
A review of potential differences between the ileum and the non-ileum subgroups or within the ileum 
subgroup (everolimus vs. placebo) was conducted by the MAH. 
No major differences were found by the MAH between the ileum and the non-ileum subgroups or 
within the ileum subgroup (everolimus vs. placebo) in terms of exposure (similar dose intensity with 
Cmin within the expected range), baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and other factors. 
A number of the parameters analysed, including time from diagnosis to study entry and tumour 
grading, were indicative of a better prognosis for the ileum subgroup. Furthermore, the observed 
median PFS for the placebo arm of 16.7 months in the ileum subgroup (Figure 5) vs. 3.9 months with 
placebo for the overall study population indicate a markedly better prognosis for patients in the ileum 
subgroup. These findings are consistent with the known favourable prognosis for patients with small 
intestine (including jejunum and ileum) as the primary tumour origin (Yao et al 2008). 
Figure 4 
Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS based on central radiology review - Patients with 
ileum as primary tumour origin 
Furthermore, the ileum subgroup sample included a relatively small number of progression events. 
Only 22 events in 47 patients were reported in the everolimus arm vs. 11 events in 24 patients in the 
placebo arm; this resulted in broad confidence intervals. 
As detailed in Table 21, the median PFS of the ileum placebo group is clearly different from the other 
placebo subgroups, whereas the median PFS which can be achieved by an effective everolimus 
treatment is in the same range or higher only for the subgroups of “tumour origin=A” (16.6 months, 
i.e., including ileum), “baseline NSE ≤ULN” (16.6 months; n=122), “Jejunum” (17.3 months; n=16) 
and “Japanese” (19.4 months, n=7). However, except for NSE, which is a known prognostic factor, 
these subgroups are too small to clinically relevant conclusions.  
Discussion of baseline disease factors of the ileum subgroup compared to the other subgroups and the 
full population was requested in view of their prognostic/predictive value and possible influence on the 
study results. In their responses the MAH argued that baseline imbalances such as bone involvement 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 38/80 
 
 
 
 
 
could have contributed to the PFS differences. Exploratory analyses supported that patients with bone 
involvement at baseline, i.e., the patients with more aggressive disease, benefit more from everolimus 
treatment than those without. However, in contrast to non-ileum patients (HR 0.37; 95%CI 0.26-
0.53), for ileal NET patients this was not statistically significant HR 1.34 (95%CI 0.63-2.87). 
PFS subgroup analyses for baseline NSE levels or tumour grading according to Ki-67/mitotic index 
were also inconclusive for the ileum subgroup. However, applying a threshold of >/≤ ULN for baseline 
CgA a point estimate for the HR of 2.90 (95%CI 0.5-16.9) for the stratified analysis was obtained for 
normal CgA levels at baseline. From a clinical point of view, this HR in NET patients with primary 
tumours of ileal origin with a normal baseline CgA together with clinical factors is regarded a sufficient 
base to recommend careful consideration before treating such patients with everolimus. 
The tumour subgroup of “Other” included different entities which also had higher PFS results than the 
FAS. 
A second subgroup of patients, with Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (17 and 8 patients; both ~8%), also 
showed a longer PFS under placebo (14.9 months) than under everolimus (11.0 months) treatment.  
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: Overall Survival 
As the primary endpoint of the study was statistically significant, the key secondary endpoint of OS 
was formally tested with an interim OS analysis performed with a total of 70 deaths (37% information 
fraction of the total targeted 191 deaths for final OS analysis). At this interim analysis the difference in 
OS was not statistically significant (stratified log-rank test p=0.037, one-sided) (Table 22) as the p-
value threshold to claim significance for OS at this interim analysis was 0.000213. From the HR, for OS 
a 36% risk reduction was estimated.  
Results were consistent in the unstratified analysis of OS; the HR was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.41, 1.06)

Figure 5 
Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival (FAS) 
At the time of 1° endpoint analysis OS was not yet mature with 27.3 months for everolimus at this 
interim analysis as only 37% of estimated deaths occurred up to the data cut-off, for “significance” a 
p-value of 0.00021 was required. A trend for prolonged OS under everolimus is observed from the 
current small number of events. 
Results of the second interim OS analysis based on 101 deaths (30-Nov-2015 data cut-off, 
corresponding to a 52.9% information fraction) continue to favour the everolimus arm with a 27% risk 
reduction relative to placebo (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.11; p=0.071).  
Based on this updated analysis of OS there was no sign to suggest that OS results in patients with ileal 
primary would differ from those observed in the overall population in patients with tumours originating 
from other locations. However, the overall number of events in the ileum group is too small for final 
conclusions. 
After discontinuation of study drug, antineoplastic therapy was used by 41.5% of the patients in the 
everolimus arm and by 55.7% of patients in the placebo arm. The most common therapy used was 
SSA, alkylating agents (temozolomide, dacarbazine), radiotherapies, pyrimidine analogues 
(capecitabine, gemcitabine, 5-FU), surgical procedures, protein-kinase inhibitors (including everolimus 
or sunitinib), all used with similar frequency in the two treatment arms, except for radiotherapies and 
protein-kinase inhibitors which were used slightly more often in the placebo arm. 
The subsequent therapies were comparable between the treatment arms, except for radiotherapy and 
kinase inhibitors, which were used more often in the placebo group. 
Other secondary endpoints 
•  ORR per central radiology assessment 
Based on the central radiology review per RECIST, none of the patients in either arm had a complete 
response as their best response during the study, while 4 patients (2.0%) in the everolimus arm and 
one patient (1.0%) in the placebo arm had a partial response (Table 23):

Results from the corresponding waterfall plot as per central radiology review showed that 63.6% of 
patients in the everolimus arm experienced any degree of tumour shrinkage versus 25.9% in the 
placebo arm (Figure 7), although the extent of this shrinkage in most cases was less than the 
magnitude required for an objective response of PR or CR per RECIST.

•  Health-related quality of life 
The mean changes from baseline of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G) total 
score/subscales were similar in both arms and never exceeded the threshold of 7 points, defined as 
the minimal clinically important difference between treatment arms. From the HR of 0.81, no 
significant differences were observed in the time to definitive deterioration of the FACT-G total score. 
This was further confirmed by longitudinal modelling with similar trends for the physical, social/family, 
emotional, and functional domain scores.

As apparent from the Kaplan-Meier curve for HRQoL as measured by FACT-G, during treatment 
everolimus patients reported a slightly better quality of life. However, after 12 months the everolimus 
curve overlaps with the placebo curve and thereafter, due to the low event numbers, no valid 
conclusions can be drawn. 
•  WHO performance status 
WHO PS was a stratification factor for randomization. No difference was observed in the time to 
definitive deterioration of WHO PS (HR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.64).

The Kaplan-Meier plot for WHO performance status is widely overlapping during the treatment period. 
Due to the low event number, no valid conclusions can currently be drawn from the second half of the 
curves. 
•  Biomarker evaluation for chromogranin A (CgA) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) 
Median levels of CgA and NSE increased during the course of treatment. These increases were more 
pronounced in the placebo arm (Figure 11). No clear association was evident between baseline CgA 
and NSE levels and prolongation of PFS with everolimus; patients derived PFS benefit irrespective of 
their biomarker level (as previously seen in Study C2324). 
Figure 10 
Least square means of CgA and NSE change over time (FAS) 
Upon request to select further prognostic baseline factors in view of their possible predictive value for 
everolimus therapy, the applicant provided data that baseline NSE >/≤ULN was the statistically most 
significant variable in the studied population (HR 1.88; 95%CI 1.28-2.78; p=0.001). On the contrary, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016

a predictive value for baseline CgA >/≤2xULN was not statistically significant (p=0.393). However, 
applying a different cut-off with CgA >/≤ULN, it seemed that the full population benefitted from 
treatment, whereas the ileum subgroup did not. It is noted, however, that the study population with 
several tumour origins of GI and lung neuroendocrine tumours was too distinct to thoroughly 
investigate this. 
Ancillary analyses 
PFS based on investigator review 
The PFS analysis based on local investigator review was supportive of the primary efficacy analysis 
with a median PFS times (95% CI) were 14.0 months (11.2, 17.7) in the everolimus arm and 5.5 
months (3.7, 7.4) in the placebo arm and an HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.54 (Table 24).

Liver tumour burden was assessed at baseline. The forest plot in Figure 13 indicates that patients with 
liver involvement of <10% had the highest HR of 0.67, while the patients with a liver tumour burden 
of >50% had the lowest HR of 0.13.

A comparable percentage of patients in both treatment arms (5 and 7%) experienced a change of

which necessitated medical intervention including SSA.

Notes 
As the primary endpoint of the study was statistically significant, the key secondary 
endpoint of OS was formally tested with an interim OS analysis performed with a total 
of 70 deaths (37% information fraction of the total targeted 191 deaths for final OS 
analysis). At this interim analysis the difference in OS was not statistically significant 
(stratified log-rank test p=0.037, one-sided) as the p-value threshold to claim 
significance for OS at this interim analysis was 0.000213. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Between April 2012 and August 2013 a total of 97 study sites worldwide randomised 302 patients in a 
2:1 manner, stratified by prior treatment with somatostatin analogues, WHO performance status and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016

tumour origin.  
The study population with gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumours was included based on in- 
and exclusion criteria which defined the target population in satisfactory detail. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria defined a population of pathologically (i.e. histologically confirmed) well-differentiated 
(G1 or G2), advanced (unresectable or metastatic), neuroendocrine tumours of GI or lung origin 
without a history and no active symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. The in- and exclusion criteria also 
distinguished the study population satisfactorily from the previously studied populations with 
everolimus in study C2325 who had a carcinoid syndrome, and in C2324 who selected patients with 
pancreatic NET only. Importantly, current progress at baseline had to be confirmed radiologically. For 
this population with grade 1 and 2 well-differentiated NETs a WHO performance status of ≤1 is 
reasonable. Prior treatment including hepatic intra-arterial embolization had to be stopped sufficient 
time prior to randomisation. No more than 1 line of chemotherapy was allowed in advance. In 
summary, the inclusion and exclusion criteria seem adequate. 
No cross-over was allowed prior to the analysis of the primary endpoint. Of note, only 7 patients 
switched to everolimus after the primary analysis (data not shown). 
The primary endpoint was progression free survival of everolimus plus best supportive care vs. placebo 
plus best supportive care, as assessed by central radiological review. This real time central review for 
the primary endpoint is highly endorsed as it provides a higher degree of standardisation and 
comparability of the results. Overall survival was the key secondary endpoint and investigator 
assessed PFS was a supportive analysis. PFS as the primary endpoint was accepted by CHMP for other 
applications in similar study populations previously and is hence accepted provided no detrimental 
effect on overall survival is evident. The study specific modifications of the RECIST criteria to assess 
tumour progression are considered reasonable. OS as the key secondary endpoint is endorsed. 
Regarding the randomisation of patients, the stratification led to fully balanced treatment arms with 
regard to prior SSA treatment, tumour origins and WHO PS. Stratification for SSA pre-treatment and 
performance status is considered adequate. For tumour origin, the strata were planned based on their 
estimated aggressiveness, i.e. stratum A comprised tumours of origins appendix, caecum, jejunum, 
ileum, duodenum and cancer of unknown primary (CUP), stratum B those of lung, stomach, rectum, 
and colon except caecum. Stratum B was hence considered the treatment arm with worse prognoses.  
The study was placebo-controlled and double-blind and no blind was broken during the treatment 
period.  
Overall the statistical methods are considered appropriate.  
Overall, the study design and conduct is considered adequate, with a limited amount of missing data 
and few major deviations from the study protocol. There is a concern, however, about the rather high 
percentage (about 16%) of patients lost to follow-up in the OS analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The result of the primary analysis was statistically significant with median PFS of 11.01 months with 
everolimus vs. 3.91 months with placebo and a HR of 0.48 (95% CI 0.35;0,67). This PFS result was 
confirmed in several sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and by the investigator review. 
It was noted by the CHMP that the consistency with PFS by IRC review is reassuring. Absolute median 
PFS by investigator was longer than after IRC review in both arms (for everolimus almost 3 months). 
This can be explained by the higher number of censored observations compared to the IRC review. 
Multiple additional pre-planned sensitivity analyses of PFS demonstrated that the observed benefit was 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 48/80 
 
 
 
 
robust and consistent with the primary analysis. The CHMP noted that the pre-planned sensitivity 
analysis confirmed the primary endpoint. Although, there appears to be some heterogeneity in PFS 
data so, that the outcome seems less favourable in Caucasians, males and in case of ileal primary 
tumour. This seems to be indicative of an imbalance in stratification factors. According to the MAH, the 
covariates used in the stratified and covariate adjusted analysis were predefined. However, it should 
be noted that all of the HRs presented for these subgroup analyses were unstratified and unadjusted 
for any covariates. After adjustment for the stratification factors used at baseline and predefined 
covariates there was a surprisingly large change: Caucasians (HR 0.83 to 0.56) and males (HR 0.78 to 
0.52) and ileal origin (1.34 to 1.01) whilst the overall HR remained reasonably stable (0.56 to 0.42). It 
is acknowledged and reassuring that after adjustment the benefit for Caucasians and male patients 
also became significant, even if not as pronounced as for other races and females.  
From the results of subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint PFS a major objection was raised: 
patients with ileum as primary tumour origin and who comprised almost a quarter of the total study 
population, did not show any beneficial effect and gain in PFS with everolimus; rather, the median PFS 
with everolimus was slightly lower with 16.6 months vs. 16.7 months under placebo. As obvious from 
the almost 13 month longer PFS in the placebo group compared to the total placebo group, in the 
ileum subgroup, patients with less unfavourable disease characteristics and hence an overall better 
prognosis were included. The Kaplan-Meier curves crossed at about 1 year and the everolimus patients 
performed worse thereafter. This was considered a random finding by the applicant. 
Notably, also the patients with ileum originated NETs studied here were patients with often resected 
primary and mainly metastatic disease, for whom currently no treatment is approved after failure of 
SSAs. Hence, while the treating oncologist will always make an individual benefit-risk assessment, this 
could be demanding especially in a patient who has a relatively favourable prognostic baseline status. 
Then the oncologist should be aided by sufficiently detailed information in the SmPC.  
Tthere were three patients in the ileum group out of 4 patients in total who showed a partial response 
and this confirmed an effect of everolimus in ileal NETs, however it remained unclear which ileal NET 
patients could benefit from treatment.  
The activity of everolimus is clearly lower as estimated by hazard ratios in patients with tumour of 
good prognosis. This has some biological plausibility and was repeatedly shown. Therefore it was 
proposed that “prognosis” should be the main issue for discussion, not the anatomical site of the 
tumour. Obviously site of tumour could be a prognostic factor per se, but within anatomical sites there 
is a high likelihood of heterogeneity. The CHMP concurred, that as to the currently available study data 
a lower efficacy of everolimus is especially manifested in the ileum subgroup, which is known to have a 
better prognosis than tumours of other NET origins. To elucidate this further, the MAH was requested 
to analyse prognostic factors. 
A review of potential differences between the ileum and the non-ileum subgroups or within the ileum 
subgroup (everolimus vs. placebo) was conducted 
Looking at the results from a clinical point of view, in contrast to the full population, in the ileum 
subgroup patients without bone involvement did not benefit as much from everolimus treatment as 
those with. But even more careful consideration should oncologists apply before starting treatment in 
ileum patients with normal CgA levels at baseline.  
Therefore, the additional information for section 5.1 pf the SmPC was endorsed, supplemented by 
further details about good prognostic factors in section 4.4.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The major objection concerning efficacy of everolimus in patients with NET of ileal origin was 
sufficiently resolved. With the MAH’s proposed inclusion of information about subgroup PFS results in 
SmPC section 5.1 and further revision of the SmPC as commented by the CHMP, the conclusion on 
efficacy is now positive. 
The CHMP recommended that the submission of mature OS data of RADIANT-4 study, in particular the 
primary ileum location should be submitted post approval. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Everolimus is currently approved in 3 oncology indications under the trade name Afinitor. Very 
common metabolic side effects reported with mTOR inhibitors result from inhibitory effects on mTOR-
regulated lipid and glucose pathways, while infections result from the immunosuppressive properties of 
these agents. Non-infectious pneumonitis is a recognized side effect of rapamycin and its derivatives, 
and represents one of the most important clinical issues seen with everolimus therapy; in result, 
consensus treatment recommendations have been published for the management of mTOR inhibitor-
associated non-infectious pneumonitis. 
Additional known risks with everolimus therapy that require close monitoring and evaluation include: 
severe infections, hypersensitivity (anaphylactic reactions), stomatitis, wound healing complications, 
increased creatinine/proteinuria/renal failure, hyperglycaemia/new onset diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipidaemia, hypophosphatemia, cardiac failure, cytopenia, haemorrhage, thrombotic and embolic 
events, female fertility (including secondary amenorrhea), pre-existing infections (reactivation, 
aggravation or exacerbation), and safety in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Hyperlipidaemia, stomatitis/oral mucositis, skin toxicity (rash and related events), hyperglycaemia, 
pneumonitis/non-infectious pneumonitis, and infection are all considered to be class effects of mTOR 
inhibitors.  
This safety evaluation of everolimus 10 mg daily is based on data from patients who have been 
exposed to everolimus or matching placebo at the recommended 10-mg daily dose. Included are 300 
of the 302 randomized patients with advanced progressive non-functional NET of GI or lung origin from 
the pivotal, phase-III study CRAD001T2302. Beyond the pivotal study population, the focus broadens 
to the 850 patients who received the 10-mg daily dose across the earlier RADIANT program. This 
program comprises patients in similar (but distinct) disease-related settings in NET (studies C2239, 
C2324 and C2325). Safety data of 9 other ongoing clinical studies and additional sources of 
information (such as literature review or post-marketing experience) was also reviewed.  
At least 17914 patients are estimated to have received everolimus in both the oncology and TSC 
(brand name: Votubia) settings in ongoing and completed investigational clinical studies sponsored by 
Novartis as of 31 Mar 2015, and the cumulative estimated post-marketing exposure is 84021 PTY. 
Patient exposure 
Study T2302 was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled, 2-arm Phase-III study comparing the efficacy and safety of everolimus 10 mg daily plus 
best supportive care (BSC) to placebo plus BSC, in patients with advanced NET of GI or lung origin 
without a history of, or current symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. A total of 285 patients were planned 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 50/80 
 
 
 
 
and a total of 302 patients were randomized to the two treatment arms in this study.  
In addition to the abovementioned target disease specific conditions, patients were required to have 
adequate bone morrow, renal and hepatic function, and no active, severe and/or uncontrolled medical 
condition: this included ALT and AST concentrations of ≤2.5-times the upper ULN (≤5 x ULN in 
patients with liver metastasis), and serum creatinine concentrations of ≤1.5-times ULN. 
Overall, exposure to everolimus was considered to be appropriate to allow for an adequate assessment 
of safety in patients who were representative of individuals with advanced non-functional NET of GI or 
lung origin. In total, 36.1% of patients were exposed to everolimus therapy and 22.4% of patients 
were exposed to placebo for a period of greater than 60 weeks. Treatment duration (calculated from 
the date of the first to the last dose of study drug [including treatment interruptions]) was longer for 
patients receiving everolimus than for those receiving placebo in Study T2302 (Table 26).

36% of patients took everolimus more than 1 year and over 30% for almost 1.5 years. 
Median duration of treatment in the everolimus group was 40 versus treatment in the placebo arm that 
was only 20 weeks. 
In relation with dose reduction and dose interruptions the mean dose intensity was 7.936 mg/day and 
9.615 mg/day in the everolimus and placebo groups, respectively (Table 27).

With a median follow-up of 21.3 months for Study T2302, a higher percentage of patients had 
discontinued treatment in the placebo arm than in the everolimus arm at the time of the data cut-off 
(28-Nov-2014). Reasons for discontinuation were primarily a result of disease progression in both 
arms, with higher rates in the placebo arm. A difference was also observed in discontinuation due to 
AE with a higher incidence of treatment discontinuation in the everolimus arm (Table 28).

were not treated due to withdrawal of consent and protocol deviation and one patient randomized to 
everolimus inadvertently received placebo treatment. 
Almost 30% of patients discontinued everolimus treatment due to AEs. A slightly higher percentage 
(38%) discontinued due to progression of disease under everolimus treatment; this was nearly half as 
in the placebo group. 
52-62% of patients are continued to be followed for further evaluations after end of study drug 
treatment, which is about 2/3 of applicable patients in both arms. 
Dose adjustments were primarily attributable to AEs (Table 29).

45 vs. 7% of patients needed dose reductions, of which about one third was attributed to AEs. 
Re-escalation was the main reason for dose reductions. This was clarified in the responses as 
temporary interruptions, e.g. for AEs or interacting drug treatment, and re-start with the next lower 
dose. 
Adverse events 
High numbers of patients with AEs were reported in both treatment groups. In the everolimus group, 
there were higher proportions of grade 3/4 AEs (69.3% vs. 28.6% for placebo), SAEs (42.1% vs. 
19.4%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (29.2% vs. 7.1%) (Table 30). It should be noted 
that the median duration of exposure was longer for patients in the everolimus group than in the 
placebo group (40.4 vs. 19.6 weeks, respectively).

For almost all organ classes with more than single events, the event rate is higher in everolimus arm.  
In study T2302, grade 3 and 4 events were observed more frequently among patients receiving 
everolimus therapy (Table 32). The most frequently reported grade 3/4 events in the everolimus group 
were diarrhoea (8.9%), stomatitis (7.4%), and anaemia (5.4%) and in the placebo group this was

The incidence of peripheral oedema was approximately 10% higher than in the pooled oncology safety 
set, and nearly 13% higher for suspected peripheral oedema (e.g., as listed in 4.8: 11.8%, grade 3 
0.3%), though the difference is less pronounced between the three NET populations studied. 
•  Clinically notable AEs 
Clinically notable AEs (CNAEs) are selected categories of risks consisting of pooled AEs that are similar 
in nature and for which there is a specific clinical interest as a result of signals identified during the 
conduct of earlier trials with everolimus.

Clinically notable AEs irrespective of causality, by grouping and maximum 
Non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) was diagnosed in 32 patients (15.8%) 
under everolimus therapy and in 2 patients (2.0%) from the placebo arm. Following a careful review of 
all events, a further case that may be considered to be representative of pneumonitis was identified in 
the everolimus group (‘ground-glass opacity of the lung’ as the verbatim term was coded to the 
preferred term ‘chest X-ray abnormal’). 
Corticosteroid therapy was initiated in 13 of 24 patients with a grade 2 non-infectious pneumonitis 
event and for 2 of 3 with a grade 3 event. No grade 4 events were reported. Dose adjustments were 
implemented for 21 patients with grade 2 events and 2 patients with a grade 3 event. Resolution was 
evident for 17 of the 24 patients with grade 2 non-infectious pneumonitis event but for none of the 3 
patients with a grade 3 event at the time of the data cut-off. Treatment with everolimus was 
discontinued for a single patient with grade 2 non-infectious pneumonitis and for none of the patients 
with a grade 3 event.

Figure 13 
Time to first occurrence of non-infectious pneumonitis (Safety Set) 
Infections were diagnosed in 118 patients (58.4%) under everolimus and 28 patients (28.6%) taking 
placebo. Taking into account the higher exposure to everolimus relative to placebo, this difference was 
reduced when the exposure-adjusted incidence rates (i.e. the numbers of patients with the event per 
100 patient-year exposure) were compared (65.3 and 42.6 for the everolimus and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively [corresponding to a ratio of 1.5:1]). 
Six patients (3.0%) with everolimus reported 8× grade 4 infections (bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, 
pneumonia, respiratory tract infection, peritonitis, sepsis, septic shock [×2], and viral myocarditis). 
Grade 3 infections occurred in 16 patients (7.9%) on everolimus. In comparison, 1 placebo-treated 
patient (1.0%) was diagnosed with a grade 4 infection and 1 patient (1.0%) with a grade 3 event. 
Stomatitis, as a common treatment-limiting side effect of cancer therapy, led to 6 patients (3.0%) 
discontinuing from therapy (1 as the result of a grade 1 event, 3 from grade 2 events, and 2 due to 
grade 3 events). Most cases were suspected by the investigator to be treatment-related. While 
reported more frequently in the everolimus group, grade 3 stomatitis-related events were relatively 
uncommon and no grade 4 stomatitis-related events were reported.

Stomatitis is an important ADR from a patient perspective. For grade 1 and 2 events of stomatitis, the 
event may resolve without dose adjustment or any other action. In case of grade 3, 12/15 underwent 
dose adjustment. 
In the CSR an analysis of the clinical/therapeutic impact of the everolimus-related clinically notable 
AEs is provided, discussing the frequencies of discontinuation and dose adjustment/interruption due to 
AE. According to this analysis, the highest impact for treatment discontinuation was found for 
infections and stomatitis events (both 3.0%), and for dose adjustments/interruptions for infection 
(17.8%), followed by stomatitis (15.8%) and non-infectious pneumonitis (11.9%).

of which were Grade 3 and 4 (71 of 85 SAEs in the everolimus arm, 14 of 19 SAEs under pleacebo). 
All-grade SAEs within the following SOCs were more frequent among patients receiving everolimus 
therapy relative to placebo: GI disorders (+9.7%), infections and infestations (+8.9%), respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (+6.9%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(+5.3%), and cardiac disorders (+5.0%).  
The all-grade SAEs reported most frequently with everolimus were abdominal pain (5.4%), which 
occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo group (4.1%), pyrexia (4.5% in everolimus vs. 1.0% 
in placebo), and anaemia (3.0% in everolimus vs. 0 in placebo).

42 everolimus-treated patients (20.8%) reported at least 1 SAE that was suspected to be related to 
study drug, compared with only 6 (6.1%) patients from the placebo group. The most commonly 
reported treatment-related SAEs (>2%) were pyrexia (8 patients [4.0%] for everolimus vs. 0 patients 
for placebo), diarrhoea (6 patients [3.0%] vs. 0 patients), pneumonia (5 patients [2.5%] vs. 0 
patients), and anaemia (5 patients [2.5%] vs.0 patients).

Out of the total number of grade 3/4 AEs, only one half (35%) was reported as SAE. 21% of 42% of 
the SAEs were considered related to study drug, vs. 6 in the control group.  
•  Deaths 
Overall, until data cut-off, 41 deaths (20.3%) occurred in the everolimus arm and 28 (28.6%) in the 
placebo arm. 
The incidence of on-treatment deaths was low: 7 of 202 (3.5%) patients in the everolimus group and 3 
of 98 (3.1%) patients in the placebo group died on treatment or within 30 days after the end of 
treatment prior to the 28-Nov-2014 data cut-off date, of which 4 and 1 were attributed to the disease 
under study and 3 and 2 to other conditions/AEs. Respiratory failure and septic shock in the 
everolimus arm, and dyspnoea event in the placebo arm were suspected by the investigator to be 
related to study drug (Table 36).

decreases in haemoglobin, lymphocytes, white cells, neutrophils, and platelets being noted in ≥30% of 
patients.  
Newly occurring or worsening abnormal values for hematologic parameters were observed mainly of 
grade 1 or grade 2 severity, but in a few occasions grade 3 or grade 4 alterations were also seen. This 
was the case for absolute lymphocytes (hypo) with worsening to grade 3 in 13.4% and to grade 4 in 
1.5% of the patients in the everolimus group, respectively, while this was 2.0% and 0%, in the 
placebo group, respectively.

Safety in special populations 
•  Age 
Adverse events reported with 1.5-fold higher incidence in patients ≥65 (n=105) receiving everolimus 
relative to those aged <65 years (n=97) and by ≥10% of patients in one of the everolimus subgroups 
included cough, decreased appetite and dysgeusia. In contrast, vomiting, headache, acneiform 
dermatitis, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, and proteinuria were reported less frequently 
among those aged ≥ 65 years. In patients ≥65 years, the likelihood is higher to stop therapy due to 
AEs (36% vs. 10% placebo) and withdrawn consent (9% vs. 0%). 
The safety of everolimus in paediatric patients was not evaluated in this study.

•  Gender 
For some events the incidence was 1.5-fold greater for one gender relative to the other. With an 
incidence of ≥ 10% in the everolimus arm there was: 
- more prominent in males: pain in extremity (12.6 vs. 6.1%) 
- more prominent in females: cough (33.0 vs. 19.5%), vomiting (17.4 vs. 11.5%), pruritus (22.6 vs. 
10.3%), and arthralgia (15.7 vs. 6.9%). 
•  Race 
Comparison was possible between the Caucasian and Asian subpopulations (Table 38). Events where 
the incidence was 1.5-fold greater for one race relative to the other and with an incidence of ≥ 10% in 
the everolimus group: 
- More prominent in Caucasians: diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea, dysgeusia, 
vomiting, hypertension, urinary tract infection, dry mouth, upper abdominal pain, pain in extremity, 
and dry skin 
- More prominent in Asians: epistaxis, hyperglycaemia, and headache.

Despite for frequency also differences in severity for grade 3/4 events were seen (over 2-fold):  
- patients <65 years of age had 3-fold more grade 3/4 hypertension (6.2 vs. 1.9%) and proteinuria 
(3.1 vs. 1.0%) than those ≥ 65 years. 
- women had >4-fold more grade 3/4 hypokalaemia than men (5.2 vs. 1.1%), nearly 4-times more 
grade 3/4 peripheral oedema and nausea (4.3 vs. 1.1%), mouth ulceration 3.5 vs. 0%, and grade 3/4 
fatigue was more prominent in women with 6.1 vs. 2.3%.  
- Caucasians only, compared to Asians (0% each), suffered from grade 3/4 diarrhoea (10.6%), grade 
3/4 hypertension (5.0%), vomiting (4.4%), grade 3/4 dyspnoea (3.1%), and pyrexia (2.5%). In 
Asians more grade 3/4 asthenia (6.5 vs. 1.9%) and hypokalaemia (9.7 vs. 2.5%) were reported.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new safety information related to drug-drug interactions has been generated in Study T2302. No 
specific analyses were conducted to evaluate the use of other drugs, tobacco, alcohol, or food habits 
on the tolerability and safety of everolimus. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation was higher with everolimus (29.2% vs. 7.1% for 
placebo). The most commonly reported AEs leading to discontinuation of everolimus therapy were 
stomatitis (3.0%), diarrhoea (1.5%), and γGT increased (1.5%). Discontinuation as the result of AEs 
from the following SOCs were also more common with everolimus (relative to placebo): GI disorders 
(+7.9%), general disorders and administration site conditions (+3.0%), infections and infestations 
(+3.0%), investigations (+3.0%), and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (+2.5%). 
The most commonly reported AEs leading to everolimus dose adjustment/interruption were stomatitis 
(14.4%), pneumonitis (9.9%), fatigue (7.4%), diarrhoea (6.9%), peripheral oedema (6.4%), pyrexia 
(6.4%), and anaemia (5.4%). Dose adjustments/interruptions as the result of AEs from the following 
SOCs were more common with everolimus (with incidences ≥5% greater than placebo): GI disorders 
(+23.1%), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (+14.7%), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (+14.1%), infections and infestations (+13.7%), investigations 
(+7.4%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (+7.4%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(+7.4%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (+6.9%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (+5.0%). 
45 vs. 7% (for everolimus and placebo respectively) needed dose reductions due to AEs and 
discontinuations due to AE were frequent with nearly 30% in the everolimus group vs. 7% in the 
placebo group.  
Post marketing experience 
The total worldwide cumulative market exposure to Afinitor/Votubia in the Oncology and TSC settings 
combined through 31-Mar-2015 is estimated to be 84021 patient treatment years. The worldwide total 
cumulative patient exposure based on the worldwide sales of tablets sold per defined daily dose 
(DDD), has been estimated at 79,056 PTY for the Oncology setting and 4,965 PTY for the TSC setting. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety of 10mg everolimus was analysed from the new pivotal study T2302 in a population with well-
differentiated advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumours of GI and lung origin without history or 
symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome (non-functional tumours), compared to placebo and plus best 
supportive case. The analysed dataset is considered adequate as regards size (n=202 and n=98 
placebo) and duration of exposure (40 weeks vs. 20 weeks under placebo) to assess the safety profile 
of everolimus in this new population. Median duration of treatment with 40 weeks is comparable to 
that in the previous NET/NET-related studies (pNET: 38 weeks; carcinoid: 37 weeks; pooled studies: 
35 weeks). The mean dose intensity of everolimus in this study was lower (7.9 mg/day vs. 9.6 mg/day 
for placebo)  than for the earlier studies in pNET (8.6 mg/d) and carcinoid (8.3 mg/d). Overall, 
exposure to everolimus was considered to be appropriate to allow for an adequate assessment of 
safety in patients who were representative of individuals with advanced non-functional NET of GI or 
lung origin. 
The reported adverse events in this GI and lung NET population included the system organ classes 
known to be compromised by everolimus. Frequencies were, overall, comparable to data obtained from 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016  
Page 67/80 
 
 
 
 
the pooled NET/NET-related studies (C2324, C2325, C2239) and no important new safety concerns 
were identified. Compared to the everolimus safety profile as listed in the Afinitor SmPC based on 2470 
patients in all approved oncologic indications, some AEs were reported at obvious higher frequencies 
and gradings in study T2302. Although the medical history and current medical conditions of the study 
patients do not show relevantly frequent respective preconditions, such events may, at least partially, 
also be symptoms attributable to the underlying tumour entities of GI and lung NET, especially the 
about 10% higher frequency seen for peripheral oedema. The reported AEs were considered 
comparable in the three different NET population. Most AEs were manageable and reversible with dose 
interruptions/reductions. The nature of events is consistent with the known safety profile of everolimus 
and they were primarily of grade 1 (mild) or grade 2 (moderate) severity. For almost all organ classes 
with more than single events, the event rate is higher in everolimus arm. Time at risk, however, must 
be taken into account. In general, all grade AEs ≥5% were reported in comparable frequencies in 
study T2302 as in the pooled dataset of the previous NET/NET-related studies. 
Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC, covers non-infectious pneumonitis in a mainly adequate way, but 
the wording in 4.4 “Non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) has been described 
in patients taking Afinitor” implies a low frequency. “Non-infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial 
lung disease) has been frequently reported in patients taking Afinitor (see 4.8)” is more appropriate. 
Considering that investigators would have already been aware of the known safety profile of Afinitor as 
listed in the SmPC, in study T2302 the AEs reported with a suspected relationship were consistent with 
this and no new safety findings became evident. 
Most SAEs were similar in nature and in frequency compared to the earlier NET studies. However, 
some of the SAEs reported are events not listed in 4.8 (small intestine obstruction). Small intestine 
obstruction is clearly more likely to be related to the underlying disease and regarding cholecystitis no 
causality could be established.   
No unusual or new clinically significant findings were observed and data relating to deaths were 
consistent with the established safety profile of everolimus and the clinical condition of patients 
enrolled in Study T2302. Overall, the primary causes of death were comparable to those observed in 
the earlier studies in a NET population. Cases attributed to AEs were typically complex and confounded 
by the natural history of the disease and concurrent comorbidities and no consistent pattern was 
evident in the nature or timing of these events. 
Frequencies and grades of laboratory abnormalities were comparable to those observed in previous 
NET studies and were also consistent with those labelled. Lymphocytes decreased, however, were 
reported with 61%, which is nearly 20% more frequent than in the earlier NET studies. 
No consistent trends were evident that were considered indicative of an increased risk for an event on 
the basis of age. The pattern of events reported in the gender subgroup analysis was consistent with 
that reported for the overall population. From subgroup analyses some differences of everolimus AEs 
between ages, genders or races were evident and despite for frequency also differences in severity for 
grade 3/4 events were seen. Patients <65 years of age had 3-fold more grade 3/4 hypertension and 
proteinuria than those ≥65 years. Women had >4-fold more grade 3/4 hypokalaemia than men, and 
suffered nearly 3-4-times more often from grade 3/4 peripheral oedema and nausea, mouth ulceration 
and fatigue. For Caucasians only, compared to Asians, grade 3/4 diarrhoea, hypertension, vomiting, 
dyspnoea and pyrexia were reported. In Asians more grade 3/4 asthenia and hypokalaemia were 
reported. When comparing these data to the currently approved oncology safety profile, for the grade 
3/4 events of the concerned subgroups with the higher occurrences (hypokalaemia, peripheral

Safety analyses between the subgroups with ileal/non-ileal NETs showed no relevant differences for 
the everolimus treated patients concerning the high frequency of all-grade or grade 3/4 AEs or SAEs. 
However, the ileal-NET placebo patients experienced only one half of grade 3/4 events (AEs 16% vs. 
32.9%, SAEs 8% vs. 16.4%), which confirms the better “overall condition” of the patients with NETs of 
ileal primary origin. 
The mean dose intensity of everolimus in this study was lower (7.9 mg) as reported in the earlier 
studies in similar populations (pNET 8.6 mg, carcinoid 8.3 mg). 45 vs. 7% (for placebo) of patients 
needed dose reductions due to AEs, discontinuations due to AE were frequent with nearly 30% (vs. 
7%). When compared to the previous pNET study, in that study only 19.1% AEs led to discontinuation 
(28% in carcinoid study). Progression under treatment leading to discontinuation was reported for 
nearly 38%, whereas 71% discontinued due to progression on placebo.  
As derived from MAH’s safety review of the pivotal study T2302 as well as from final data cut-offs of 2 
newly-completed studies already in the safety pool (pivotal studies C2324 [pNET] and Y2301 [mBC]), 
the MAH proposed some updates of the safety profile in section 4.8. The amendments were considered 
reasonable. Of note, new safety-related information received with the responses to 1st RSI didn’t 
warrant changes of the SmPC. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Despite some uncertainties, the safety data reported in the GI and lung NET population in study T2302 
is in agreement with what is already known for Afinitor in other oncologic indications, i.e., rather 
poorly tolerated but severe irreversible toxicity is less of a concern. No clinically relevant new safety 
findings became evident. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
PSURs shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements set out in the list of Union reference 
dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the 
European medicines web-portal. Marketing authorisation holders shall continuously check the European 
medicines web-portal for the DLP and frequency of submission of the next PSUR. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  12.0  (dated  15  March  2016)  is  acceptable.  The  PRAC 
endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with the following changes:  
• 
To further confirm the benefit of Afinitor, in particular in the primary ileum location, mature OS 
data of the RADIANT-4 study should be submitted by the MAH as post authorisation measure 
(PAM).  
The MAH committed to comply with the above noted recommendation.  
The CHMP endorsed the Afinitor RMP version 12.1 (dated 25 April 2016) with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
The full PI, as a relevant example with all changes highlighted is provided as an attachment. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The following key information remains the same as for the currently approved PL for Afinitor: 
•  Section 2 ‘What you need to know before you take Afinitor’, 
•  Section 3 ‘How to take Afinitor’, 
•  Section 5 ‘How to store Afinitor’ 
•  Section 6 ‘Contents of the pack and other information’ 
Changes to the PL are limited to the following: 
•  Section 1 ‘What Afinitor is and what it is used for’ includes a revision of the current approved 
indication (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours) in order to describe the proposed indication in 
patient friendly language. 
•  Section 4 ‘Possible side effects’ includes changes in frequency categories of two side effects (no 
new side effect described).

everolimus vs. placebo, plus best supportive care, as assessed by independent central radiological 
review (HR 0.48). In this population of patients with GI and lung NET PFS is an accepted relevant 
endpoint. In addition, neuroendocrine tumours are often slowly growing with low aggressiveness, so 
that measurement of overall survival as the primary endpoint would gain relevant study results only 
with a substantial time delay. PFS was also accepted by CHMP in other studies in other NET 
populations, e.g. the everolimus studies for pNET and carcinoid NETs and other drug substances like 
sunitinib for pNET. The realtime independent central radiological review for PFS guaranteed 
comparable and reliable results for PFS. 
The benefit of everolimus on median PFS was supported by similar results from several sensitivity 
analyses, by investigator local assessment and several predefined and post-hoc analysed subgroups, 
including exploratory analyses of baseline prognostic factors. 
Both pre-planned interim OS analyses showed a trend for OS in favour of everolimus vs. placebo with 
hazard ratios of 0.64 and 0.73. 
The breakdown of the response rates was comparable with previous observations in the pNET 
population and the knowledge of the antiproliferative but not cytotoxic mechanism of action of 
everolimus. The rate of stable disease and the disease control rate obtained with everolimus were 
substantially higher than under placebo, with 80.5% vs. 63.9% SD as best overall response, while 
objective response were rarely seen (PR in 4 patients=2.0% vs. 1 patient=1.0%; no CR). PD as best 
overall response was reduced to 9.3% with everolimus vs. 26.8% under placebo. 
In the subgroup with ileum-originated NET, partial response was reported for 3 patients.  
While the rate of deaths on treatment was similar (3.5% and 3.1%), the rate of all deaths was lower 
under everolimus (20.3% vs. 28.6%) 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The overall impression from conducted subgroup analyses was that efficacy in terms of PFS HRs was 
more favourable in case of poorer prognosis. Thus prior chemotherapy, high baseline CgA, high Ki-
67/mitotic index, high liver tumour burden were all apparently associated with a more favourable HR. 
In the subgroup with ileum as the primary site of tumour origin no beneficial effect of everolimus vs. 
placebo was observed (PFS HR close to one after adjustment). In this subgroup median PFS in the 
placebo group was also clearly longer than in the full study population. No individual prognostic factor 
accounted for this absence of demonstrated PFS benefit, but normal CgA and absence of bone 
involvement might be of importance. On the other hand three partial responses were observed in 47 
patients in the everolimus group, i.e. more than expected underlying the heterogeneity in this 
subgroup. These data are adequately reflected in the SmPC sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
Baseline NSE >/≤ULN was the statistically most significant prognostic factor in the studied population, 
in contrast to baseline CgA >/≤2xULN. However, applying a different cut-off with CgA >/≤ULN, it 
seemed that the full population benefitted from treatment, whereas the ileum subgroup did not. 
Notably, the study population with several tumour origins of GI and lung neuroendocrine tumours was 
too distinct to thoroughly investigate this. These data are adequately reflected in the SmPC section 
5.1. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
With regard to the nature of known and listed adverse reactions, the overall toxicity profile was 
comparable to those observed in earlier NET populations and in the full oncology safety pool and is 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/390543/2016

considered to be reasonably well characterized by now. Well known adverse reactions include: 
hyperlipidemia, stomatitis/mucositis, skin toxicity (rash and related events), hyperglycemia, 
pneumonitis/non-infectious pneumonitis and infection, all considered class effects. The metabolic side 
effects result from inhibitory effects on mTOR-regulated lipid and glucose pathways, while infections 
stem from the immunosuppressive properties of these agents. 
The rates of adverse events, SAEs, SAEs leading to discontinuation and similarly the rates for these 
adverse events suspected to be related to study drug was clinically relevantly higher in the everolimus 
arm, with about 20-50%, compared to the placebo arm. Differences of >30% were reported for 
stomatitis, diarrhoea, peripheral oedema, fatigue and rash. Most frequencies were comparable to those 
reported from the pool of earlier NET studies but often higher than listed in the SmPC. 
Also grade 3 and 4 adverse events were reported also about 10-40% more often in the everolimus 
arm. 
Safety analyses between the subgroups of primary neuroendocrine tumour origins ileum vs. non-ileum 
showed no relevant differences for the everolimus treated patients concerning the high frequency of 
all-grade or grade 3/4 AEs or SAEs. However, the placebo-treated patients with ileal NETs experienced 
only one half of grade 3/4 adverse events. 
Peripheral oedema were observed at a frequency of 38.6% with 3.0% grade 3/4 AEs, which was about 
10% higher than listed for the oncology pool but comparable with the frequencies reported in the 
phase III pNET and carcinoid studies. 
As an overall measure of tolerability it is observed that in about 30% of patients in study T2302, 
treatment was discontinued due to AE (vs. less than 10% in the control) and 20 % were considered 
drug related. Also more dose reductions and interruptions occurred which led to a lower final dose 
intensity compared to the previous pNET and carcinoid studies.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of everolimus is known from previous assessments for the initial MAA of renal cell 
carcinoma and several extensions of indications for pancreatic NET and breast cancer. Therefore, there 
are currently no additional uncertainties about the unfavourable effects and no new signs became 
evident.

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin without carcinoid syndrome are a group of 
rare diseases which are often diagnosed only due to unspecific symptoms or found by chance during 
routine investigations. Most often, they are well-differentiated, have a low aggressiveness and hence 
an often good long-term prognosis. Therefore (as represented in the studied population by well- or 
moderately differentiated NETs of grades G1 and G2) and due to a low symptom burden, NET patients 
are often not in urgent need of medical treatment. Hence when treating such patients, the occurrence, 
frequency and severity of ADRs have to be weight against the slow course of the disease overall.  
Currently, for patients with non-functional NET of gastrointestinal and lung origin treatment options 
are limited. For NETs with or without carcinoid symptoms somatostatin analogues are approved in the 
EU, with octreotide for treatment-naïve patients of midgut NET or CUP and lanreotide for GEP-NET of 
G1 and partly G2. In addition, for progressive pancreatic NET sunitinib and everolimus are approved in 
the EU. Slow-growing NETs are badly amenable with cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
In the studied population of the pivotal study T2303 patients with progressive, unresectable or 
metastatic, low and intermediate grade (well-differentiated) neuroendocrine tumours of 
gastrointestinal or lung origin without carcinoid syndrome were included. Both treatment-naïve and 
pretreated patients were included, the latter had received SSAs in about 54% and chemotherapy in 
about 26%. Results of the primary endpoint progression free survival showed a statistically significant 
improvement of median PFS from 3.9 months for placebo plus best supportive care to 11.0 months 
with everolimus treatment plus best supportive care, HR 0.48 (95%CI 0.35;0,67), as assessed by 
nearly “real time” central radiological review. A PFS benefit of everolimus was shown for both, 
pretreated (significant) and treatment naïve patients. From the early interim analysis for OS from only 
37% of planned events also a favourable trend for everolimus was seen, which was confirmed by the 
second OS interim analysis after about 53% events. The overall median PFS gain of 7.1 months (HR

0.48) has to be seen in the context of the trend to improvement in overall survival and provides a 
clinically meaningful benefit for the everolimus treated patient population in study T2302.  
Literature and clinical guidelines (e.g. ENETS) describe jejuno-ileal NETs as a certain NET entity with 
distinct clinical and mainly good prognostic characteristics and thus different treatment approaches 
compared to other gastrointestinal NETs. In the ileum group everolimus provided no additional clinical 
advantage in terms of median PFS; on the other hand, NETs of jejunum had a considerable worse 
prognosis compared to ileum NETs.  
The pivotal study showed that the overall treatment benefit of everolimus is minimal compared to 
placebo treatment in the ileum patient group, but everolimus has relevant side effects, which were as 
pronounced in the ileum group as in the overall population.  
The requested elaboration of relevant prognostic factors from the ileum and non-ileum patient groups 
provided statistically significant results for baseline NSE and grading according to Ki-67/mitotic index 
for the full population, whereas for the ileum group also normal baseline CgA levels and no bone 
involvement are considered clinically relevant for a treatment decision. 
Respective new information was included in the SmPC. 
The toxicity profile of everolimus has been known for several years based on clinical studies and post-
marketing data in various approved oncologic (and for other non-oncologic) indications. Certain (very) 
common toxicities obviously impair the daily life of the patients with diarrhoea, stomatitis, rash, 
infections, etc. While it is acknowledged that adverse reactions are often graded mild to moderate and 
possible to control in clinical practice by administration of supportive care, the safety results of study 
T2301 showed details of an increased toxicity in terms of frequencies and severities in the GI and lung 
NET population, as compared to other NET and tumour entities, and resulted in more dose 
adjustments, and finally overall lower dose intensity. With a median duration of therapy of 40+ weeks, 
this makes everolimus rather poorly tolerated. 
However, although the substantial toxicity of everolimus is obvious according to the HRQOL data there 
is no clinically important disadvantage in HRQOL for the entire population. 
Benefit-risk balance 
For patients with progressive unresectable or metastatic GI or lung NET the gain in median PFS of 7.1 
months in study T2302 is considered to be a clinically relevant benefit, in spite of the known toxicities 
of everolimus treatment. The PFS benefit in progressive patients was independent of pretreatment with 
SSAs or chemotherapy, thus a clinical advantage compared to standard of care, which is here best 
supportive care only (i.e. placebo) was shown.  
A benefit in terms of median PFS gain is not significant in the subgroup of patients with ileum as 
tumour origin and it has been shown that the efficacy of everolimus is clearly lower in patients with 
tumours of good prognosis. However, TEAEs and TESAEs were seen at similar frequencies in patients 
with ileal and non-ileal NETs. As a result, new information concerning prognostic factors that could 
guide the clinician in the individual benefit-risk assessment was included in the SmPC. 
The nature of toxicities seen in this population was comparable to the known safety profile, however 
with certain higher frequencies or severity grade compared to the oncology safety pooled data. This 
resulted in more dose interruptions and dose reductions than observed in previous NET studies. 
Nevertheless, even with overall lower dose intensities the gain in PFS and trend for prolonged OS were 
seen. Thus, the benefit-risk balance in the proposed indication is considered positive.

Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Wording has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC as regards prognostic factors to take into 
account in the decision to treat or not with everolimus which includes a statement that a clear effect 
has not been shown in neuroendocrine tumours of ileal origin. In addition, the CHMP included further 
information in section 4.4 concerning prognostic baseline factors to guide treatment decisions. 
In conclusion, the benefit-risk balance of everolimus in the indication “treatment of unresectable or 
metastatic, well-differentiated (G1 or G2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal 
or lung origin in adults with progressive disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of Indication to include a new indication for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, 
well-differentiated non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of gastrointestinal or lung origin in adults 
with progressive disease; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 9.1. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

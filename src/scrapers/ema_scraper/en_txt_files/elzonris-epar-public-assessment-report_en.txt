2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare haematologic malignancy characterized 
by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In 2008, BPDCN was classified by 
the World Health Organization (WHO) as a distinct entity in the group of “acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML) and related precursor neoplasms”.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
The prevalence estimate for BPDCN in line with the information presented for the EU orphan 
designation application is 1.2 per 10,000. The true incidence and prevalence of BPDCN, like many 
other rare diseases without definitive and/or effective therapy, is not precisely known. However, based 
on a published report (Wang, 2012), BPDCN may constitute approximately 0.44% of haematologic 
cancers annually, or approximately 700 and 1000 incident cases annually in the US and Europe, 
respectively. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features/Aetiology and pathogenesis 
BPDCN is a rare and aggressive haematodermic neoplasm, which typically occurs in elderly patients, 
with a mean age between 60 and 70 years; however, the disease may present at any age. BPDCN is 
more prevalent in males, with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Typically, the malignant cell in BPDCN has 
abundant cytoplasm with a medium or low nucleus-to-cytoplasmic ratio and displays faint basophilia 
without granulation. However, microvacuoles are commonly seen, most likely made of glycogen, 
arranged in a way to adopt a “pearl necklace” aspect beneath the nuclear membrane and characteristic 
pseudopod-like cytoplasmic expansions. Malignant cells of BPDCN generally coexpress CD4+ and 
CD56+ without coexpressing common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers. However, in some cases 
of BPDCN cells express myeloid markers (CD33), suggesting that CD33 expression on CD4+ and 
CD56+ cells should not exclude such diagnoses. 
Several cases of BPDCN showed coexpression of CD2, CD7, CD33, and/or CD117. Identified key 
markers include CD123, the interleukin-3 receptor a-chain, T cell leukaemia/lymphoma 1 (TCL1), blood 
dendritic cell antigen-2 (CD303/BDCA-2), and CD2- associated protein (CD2AP). CD2AP appears to be 
restricted to plasmacytoid dendritic cells, potentially making it a useful tool to confirm the diagnosis of 
BPDCN. 
Recurrent reciprocal chromosomal translocations or inversions, as are common in acute leukaemias or 
mature lymphoid neoplasms, have not been identified in BPDCN. Instead, karyotypic analysis often 
shows complex aberrations similar to those seen in MDS or AML arising from MDS. No single defining 
genetic abnormality is described, but, by far, the most frequently observed is deletion 5q (up to 72% 
of cases), followed in decreasing frequency by alterations of 13q, 12p, and 6q and losses of 
chromosomes 15 and 9. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 11/207 
 
 
  
  
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The disease has a proclivity to involve the skin, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Up to 90% of patients 
have asymptomatic solitary or multifocal skin lesions that can be nodules or patch-plaque or bruise-like 
areas that measure from a few millimetres to up to 10 cm. Associated erythema, hyperpigmentation, 
purpura, and ulceration can be seen. In nearly 50% of cases, the skin lesions are the only detectable 
extramedullary tumour manifestation. LN involvement at presentation is common (40%-50%), but 
splenomegaly (~20%) or involvement of other mucosal sites (~10%) is relatively infrequent. Systemic 
B symptoms are rare at diagnosis. Low-level BM and peripheral blood (PB) involvement are seen in 
most cases (60%-90%); however, initial fulminant leukaemia is rare (5%-25%). Fulminant leukaemia 
is a common feature of HDT progression or relapse and is nearly always present in the terminal stage. 
The diagnosis of BPDCN is based on a constellation of clinical features, morphologic findings, and 
cytogenetic and molecular data. BPDCN exhibits a specific immunophenotype and coexpresses CD4, 
CD43, CD45RA, and CD56 as well as pDC-related antigens, including CD123 (interleukin 3α chain 
receptor), T-cell leukaemia 1 (TCL1), cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen, blood dendritic cell 
antigen (BDCA) 2 (CD303), BDCA4/CD304, CD2AP, Spi-B transcription factor, and platelet endothelial 
cell adhesion molecule (CD31). The median overall survival observed in BPDCN is 12 to 16 months, 
irrespective of the initial pattern of disease. Advanced age is an adverse prognostic factor.  
2.1.5.  Management 
There are no medicines specifically authorised for the treatment of BPDCN and no standard of care 
treatment has been established for patients with newly-diagnosed (first-line) or previously-treated 
(relapsed/refractory) disease.  
Because of the rarity of BPDCN, no prospective data are available to define the most optimal frontline 
therapy. Clinical practice varies based on institutional preference. Limited cutaneous disease at 
presentation, without obvious nodal, bone marrow, and/or peripheral blood involvement, is not 
uncommon. However, even in such cases, local therapies (e.g., surgical excision or involved field 
radiation therapy) are ineffective, with systemic relapse anticipated in almost all cases, typically within 
6 months.  
According to limited retrospective reviews, empirical therapies historically employed to treat patients 
with treatment-naïve BPDCN generally were those, or modified versions of those, used for aggressive 
haematologic malignancies, including lymphoma (e.g. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone [CHOP] or CHOP-like), AML (e.g. cytarabine plus an anthracycline), or acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) (e.g. cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, [hyper-CVAD] 
alternating with methotrexate, and cytarabine). 
Feuillard et al treated 23 patients with CHOP-like regimens and reported a complete response (CR) 
rate of 86%; however, responses were short lived, with a median time to relapse of 9 months. More 
intensive, ALL-like treatment regimens (e.g., hyper-CVAD) yielded higher response rates. Pemmaraju 
et al reported a CR of 90% in 10 patients treated with hyper-CVAD, reporting a median duration of 
response of 20 months and a median overall survival rate of 29 months (Kharfan-Dabaja, 2013). AML-
like treatment regimens have also been used as initial therapy. Dietrich et al reported a CR rate of 
83% in 6 patients treated with an AML-like regimen. 
BPDCN patients should be referred for an allo-HCT evaluation as soon as possible to determine their 
candidacy for the procedure and to initiate donor identification in eligible cases. If a suitable human 
leukocyte antigen compatible donor is identified, allo-HCT should be considered in patients in first CR, 
which appears to be a prerequisite for long term durable remissions. Auto-HCT could be offered in the 
Assessment report

setting of chemosensitive disease, preferably early in the disease course if a suitable donor is not 
available. This represents an important treatment algorithm to consider due to relatively short-lived 
remissions after frontline therapies and because effective second-line therapies remain elusive. 
About the product 
Tagraxofusp is a CD123 directed cytotoxin composed of recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL 3) and 
truncated diphtheria toxin (DT) fusion protein that targets CD123 expressing cells. Tagraxofusp 
irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis of target cells by inactivating elongation factor 2 (EF2), resulting 
in apoptosis (cell death). 
The sponsor applied for the following indication: Elzonris is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). 
During the evaluation the applicant revised the proposed indication as follows: Elzonris is indicated as 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm 
(BPDCN) (see section 5.1). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the CHMP considered 
that the product could be of major public health interest. This was based on the results of overall 
survival associated with manageable safety as presented by the applicant. Indeed, no therapy for 
BPDCN is considered the standard of care, given the low incidence of this disease and poor durability of 
responses for most strategies used to date. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as the nature/complexity of the quality MOs remaining at D90 did not fit into 
the accelerated procedure anymore and a normal timetable for assessment was therefore required. In 
addition, request for SAG consultation could not fit into the accelerated assessment timetable. 
The application was submitted by TMC Pharma (EU) Limited; during the procedure the applicant was 
changed to Stemline Therapeutics B.V.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (international nonproprietary name: tagraxofusp) is a 524-amino acid, 
recombinant non-glycosylated fusion protein expressed in an Escherichia coli cell line. from a hybrid 
gene comprised of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of human interleukin-3 (IL-3) contiguous 
with a truncated version of diphtheria toxin (DT) intentionally engineered without its receptor binding 
domain, since the IL-3 replaces the DT receptor binding domain. 
Figure 1: Protein sequence of tagraxofusp 
Tagraxofusp is therefore composed of human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and truncated diphtheria toxin that 
inhibits protein synthesis and induces apoptosis in cells expressing the interleukin-3 receptor (IL-3R). 
The tagraxofusp protein consists of an N-terminal methionine, followed by the first 388 amino acids of 
DT comprising the catalytic and translocation domains. The DT fragment (Q388R variant) is genetically 
fused at the C-terminus through a His-Met dipeptide linker to the N-terminus of the full 133-amino acid 
sequence of human IL-3. Two disulphide bonds are present and no free cysteines are observed. 
The molecular weight of tagraxofusp based on the amino acid sequence is 57,695.1 Dalton. The 
molecular formula of tagraxofusp is C2553H4026N692O798S16. 
Control of materials 
Acceptable information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. No 
human or animal derived materials are used in the active substance manufacturing process and 
acceptable documents have been provided for raw materials of biological origin used in the 
establishment of cell substrate. 
Detailed descriptions of consumables such as resins and filters are presented. Leachables and 
extractables for single-use material are discussed further below. For material containing, or coming 
into contact with, animal-derived components, an evaluation and a TSE/BSE statement is included in 
the dossier and found satisfactory. 
The tagraxofusp expression system is based on E. coli BLR(DE3). Construction of the plasmids used to 
generate the initial cell clones, transfection of cells and selection of the producing clone were 
sufficiently described, as well as the strategy leading to the selection of the final RCB.

A two-tiered cell bank system was established for commercial production. The banking procedure was 
adequately described and qualified in accordance with ICH Q5D guideline. The cell banks are stored at 
multiple locations.  
The information regarding the host cell and the vector is sufficient and the approach for manufacture 
and testing of the master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) is supported. Tests performed 
on MCB and WCB include: detection of bacteriophage, cell viability, retention of expression construct, 
sequencing of recombinant plasmid expression vector, plasmid analysis by restriction mapping, purity 
by complex media and gram stain and identity by analytical profile index and gram stain. No animal-
sourced materials were included in the manufacture of the MCB or the WCB although animal-derived 
tryptone was used in the culture medium for the pre-Research Cell Bank (RCB). 
The proposed stability testing of the MCB and the WCB (analyses and intervals) is acceptable.  
The proposed approach taken to define the limit of in vitro cell age, LIVCA, is supported. End of 
production cells are appropriately prepared, characterised and tested. Genetic stability has been 
appropriately demonstrated. 
There is no protocol for the establishment of future WCBs in the dossier. The applicant confirms that 
manufacture and testing of future WCBs will be applied for via post-approval variation application. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the tagraxofusp active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information 
has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance 
manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-
process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Process parameters that impact critical quality attributes (CQAs) and need to be controlled in a 
relatively narrow range are defined as critical process parameters (CPPs), this is endorsed since in line 
with ICH Q8(R2). 
Process validation 
The tagraxofusp active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately at the 
commercial site. Consistency in production has been shown on four full scale commercial batches 
manufactured using the commercial process. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational 
parameters and likewise acceptance criteria for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the 
purification process consistently produces tagraxofusp active substance of reproducible quality that 
complies with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
During manufacturing process development, four active substance manufacturing processes were 
used: A, B1, B2 and C. During manufacturing process development, several manufacturing processes 
were used. The CHMP raised a major objection on information relating to comparability of 
manufacturing processes. Additional information was then provided and the major objection was 
resolved.  
Due to the limited clinical exposure using commercial process/batches and non-compliance to ICH Q5E, 
the abbreviated comparability study presented was not accepted and major objections were raised by 
CHMP during the assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 15/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Additional information was then provided to support the comparability between processes B1/B2 and 
process C batches. As an overall conclusion, the data provide support the claim that process C material 
is comparable to process B1/B2 material and the major objection was resolved.  
The applicant proposes a control strategy approach based on quality risk management principles. 
The proposed approach to establish the process control strategy does not fully correspond to the ICH 
Q8 requirements since the QTPP profile and the list of CQA were established after process 
characterisation and process validation studies. A major objection was raised asking for a justification 
of the control strategy. In order to resolve the major objection, the applicant confirmed that proven 
acceptable ranges’ (PARs) parameters will be varied (that is, adjusted within approved ranges) one at 
a time only and additional tests are added as process parameters or in-process controls. This is 
considered acceptable. 
The applicant confirms that the proposed approach for this application is a traditional approach and not 
a QbD filing. However, QbD elements such as risk assessment and multivariate experimental design 
were used during process characterisation. Results from multivariate and univariate experiments were 
used to evaluate process parameter criticality. According to the narrative, the process parameter 
acceptable ranges were confirmed rather than defined, by the process characterisation.  
Process characterisation studies were performed to ensure acceptable process performance and 
product quality from the design and operating space around NORs. The strategy to use multivariate 
understanding to increase process knowledge and establish ranges for process parameters is 
supported. It is also acknowledged that a multivariate process characterisation does not necessarily 
lead to a multivariate manufacturing description and control. The multivariate models used to gain 
knowledge about significant effects of process parameters on attributes are now sufficiently described 
but the model validities and goodness-of-fits have not been submitted. It is agreed that the fit of the 
models is not as important when the main use is that of assessment of parameter criticality rather 
than prediction. The fact that the model validities are not submitted, and that it was not possible to 
evaluate process parameter interactions for several steps leads to the conclusion that process 
parameters should only be allowed to vary (that is, adjusted within approved ranges) one at a time 
within the proposed ranges. 
It is noted that the characterised ranges in general are quite narrow, which probably is one reason as 
to why only few effects with practical significance are found. 
The process characterisation results are presented in extensive tables with parameter and attribute 
classification, acceptable operating ranges (AORs) and NORs, and rationales. The presentation and 
defined parameter and attribute limits are approvable, considering that additional CQAs, CPPs, Key 
Process Parameters (KPPs) and Key Process Attributes (KPAs), have been added to the control 
strategy. 
Characterisation 
State-of-the art methods were applied to characterize the primary, secondary and tertiary structure 
and various physicochemical properties of tagraxofusp.  
Process-related impurities 
Process-related impurities were shown to be removed to low levels by the purification process as 
discussed for process validation (PV) batches and spiking studies performed during development 
studies.

Specification 
The active substance release specifications are presented. They include tests for identity, strength, 
potency, purity, safety and general properties. 
The proposed release and shelf-life specifications cover the relevant characteristics of the protein and 
appropriate stability-indicating analytical procedures are established to monitor and assess the 
degradation patterns of the protein.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The potency is determined using a bioassay. 
During the procedure a major objection was raised on the adequacy of the potency method validation. 
A detailed review of the current cell-based cytotoxicity assay was conducted leading to a re-
development effort to optimize method performance and to address a number of factors that 
contribute to variability. The method has been revised and a full re-validation performed and 
considered acceptable, resolving the major objection. 
An updated method description and a summary of the re-validation of the method is provided. An 
investigation was performed in order to explain the observed bias between the two versions (former 
and current) of the cell-based cytotoxicity assay.  The bias initially observed was not confirmed by the 
new testing which was performed for each sample using individual reference standards for each assay. 
The proposed explanation is endorsed. 
A receptor binding test method was introduced upon CHMP’s request.  
As requested, acceptance criteria are now included in the active substance specification and are 
considered acceptable. The method summary and the validation of this new assay raise several 
outstanding points. An ongoing investigation is performed to explain the observed overall lower 
receptor binding activity of the active substance and the finished product relative to reference material. 
The update of the results of the ongoing investigation is not available until January 2021. Potential 
impact of the conclusions of this investigation should be considered for active substance and finished 
product release and shelf life specifications for receptor binding. The applicant proposes to discuss a 
potential revision of the active substance and finished product release and shelf life specifications via a 
post-approval variation. This is supported and the current method is deemed suitable for authorisation 
with the commitment to improve the method (listed as a recommendation for a future quality 
development).  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on 7 pilot scale and 5 commercial scale batches of the active substance were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing 
process. 
Batch data for the active substance were presented for Process B1, Process B2 and Process C batches.  
Reference materials 
The history of the three reference standards used during development was described and is 
comprehensive.  
Data was evaluated with equivalence testing for changes in reference standards. And the results are 
acceptable.

A protocol for qualification of new reference material is submitted. It was used for qualification of a 
new WRS and it has been confirmed that this protocol will be used for future WRS as well. 
Stability 
The applicant proposes a commercial shelf life for tagraxofusp active substance of 36 months at the 
recommended long-term storage condition of -70°C ± 10°C.  
The container closure material is identical to the active substance container closure, except for the 
smaller volume and considered representative of commercial closure. 
Shelf life specifications have been revised during process development. The currently proposed shelf 
life specifications are the same as the proposed commercial active substance release. The chosen 
analytical methods are adequately stability indicating. 
As requested by CHMP, real-time receptor binding stability results have been reported for active 
substance batches and demonstrate that the acceptance criteria are fulfilled.  
All future stability protocols will include potency assessment via the current cytotoxic potency assay 
and receptor binding. Additionally, the method will be added to future timepoints for ongoing stability 
studies. The applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies until completion and to report 
out-of-specification stability results to the authorities. This is endorsed. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justifies the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a concentrate for solution for infusion presented as a single use, sterile aqueous 
solution  at  a  concentration  of  1mg/mL.  The  excipients  are  typically  used  for  formulating  this  kind  of 
product. The product is presented as a 1 mL solution in a 2 mL vial.  
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards.  There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  No  excipients  of 
human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of the finished product. No formula overages are 
included. 
The container closure system consists of a 2 mL glass vial, a 13 mm butyl rubber stopper and a flip-off 
seal. The development of the primary container closure system is sufficiently described and appropriate 
extractable/leachables studies were performed and do not raise any safety concern. 
The formulation steps are performed during the finished product manufacturing process. An acceptable 
overview is provided on the development of the formulation, including satisfactory data supporting the 
proposed composition of the commercial finished product.  
Throughout  development,  visual  inspection  of  the  finished  product  revealed  the  presence  of 
proteinaceous product-related particles. A major objection was raised requesting more information on 
the source and nature of visible particles. The proteinaceous nature of these visible particles seemed to 
be  demonstrated  however,  additional  silicone  was  observed  during  the  particle  studies.  The  silicon 
observed during the particle studies was investigated and determined to have been introduced to the 
finished product samples used for this study primarily from the use of siliconized stoppers used during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 18/207 
 
 
  
  
 
manufacturing  at  the  initial  contract  manufacturer  during  development.  While  other  single-use 
components  used  during  manufacturing  also  contain  silicon,  the  transient  nature/short  duration  of 
contact was deemed to be less likely to result in silicon contamination in the product. 
Since transfer of the process to the current contract manufacturer in 2014, non-siliconized stoppers, the 
same as the proposed commercial container closure system, have been used. 
Silicon levels for aged finished product were assessed as part of the extractable/leachable study. From 
this study, silicone oil was not found in the aged finished product. A long-term leachable study is ongoing, 
with  no  levels  of  concern  reported  through  12  months  of  testing  to  date.  After  transfer  to  another 
manufacturing  site,  it  is  clear  that  silicone  is  no  longer  an  issue.  The  applicant  indicates  that  visible 
particles are removed prior to dose administration by an in-line 0.2 μm filter used during administration 
(not supplied). The studies performed in order to demonstrate the nature of observed particles and all 
the  data  regarding  the  formulation  studies  performed  to  reduce  or  remove  visible  particulate  matter 
have been provided and found acceptable. Moreover, the specification limit has been changed. This is 
deemed  acceptable  and  sufficient  to  resolve  the  major  objection.  The  capacity  of  the  in-line  filter 
(polyethersulfone) to remove these proteinaceous particles and its compatibility with the finished product 
is appropriately demonstrated. No loss in potency nor of protein was observed.  
During  manufacturing  process  development,  two  major  modifications  were  introduced.  The  first 
modification  was  introduced  early  in  the  development,  it  consisted  of  the  change  from  process  A  to 
process B, including the change of the manufacturing site and introduction of improvements during the 
manufacturing process. Comparability between process B batches and process B batches is provided and 
batches are demonstrated to be comparable. 
Regarding process characterisation, the same approach as the one used for the active substance was 
proposed  for  the  finished  product.  A  risk  analysis  was  performed,  and  results  of  the  process 
characterisation studies were used to set the NORs and PARs for the process parameters. The ranges 
proposed in the description of the manufacturing process are acceptable and will ensure consistency of 
the  manufacturing  process.  Discrepancies  observed  between  the  manufacturing  process  development 
and  the  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  sections  are  discussed  and  additional  controls  have 
been added to the manufacturing process. 
A compatibility study was performed with the finished product after dilution in 0.9% NaCl solution to a 
concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The aim of the in-use study was to demonstrate compatibility of the product 
with  the  diluent,  an  intravenous  tubing  set,  syringes,  and  a  terminal  in-line  filter  used  in  the  clinical 
administration  of  this  product  during  4  hours  at  ambient  temperature.  Protein  recovery  and  potency 
were determined to demonstrate the compatibility of the dilution and material with the finished product. 
The additional compatibility study addressed the reduction of the visible particles and the compatibility 
of the finished product with the in-line filter. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of several steps corresponding to: bulk active 
substance (BAS) thaw, Tris buffer preparation, sodium chloride/sorbitol diluent preparation, 
compounding of bulk solution, sterile filtration, filling, stoppering, sealing and inspection. The finished 
product is released for the EU market at MIAS Pharma Ltd., Ireland. During the procedure a major 
objection was raised on missing information regarding the Baxter Oncology GmbH, Germany and 
Charles River Laboratories Germany GmbH, Germany quality control testing laboratories. The missing 
information including GMP certificates for both sites were provided and the major objection resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 19/207 
 
 
  
  
 
All finished product manufacturing sites are GMP-authorised for the relevant activities. The finished 
product vials are stored at -20°C ± 5°C 
Acceptable ranges for process parameters are considered the normal operating ranges (NORs). In 
addition, acceptance criteria are established for the process controls (IPC/IPT). These acceptance 
criteria are acceptable as they manage to obtain a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process 
as regards the process validation data provided.  
The definition of the CPPs is not in line with ICHQ8(R2), where a PP having an impact (even low 
impact) in a CQA, is considered as a CPP. Only one process parameter, mixing time at the mixing of 
bulk compounded solution step, has been identified as critical (CPP). However, the applicant’s 
approach is accepted since both process parameters (CPP and non-CPP) are controlled on a routine 
basis. Two IPC are identified at the filtration step: the pre-filtration bioburden prior to the sterile 
filtration step and the filter integrity post sterile filtration step.  
The manufacturing process controls have been updated to include an integrity test of the sterilising 
filters prior to use.  
The process validation studies described in the dossier comprise finished product process validation, 
sterilisation process validation, filter validation and transport validation.  
The validation studies included mainly the process parameter and process control results. The results 
met the NOR/PAR established based on the process characterisation studies and the proposed 
acceptance criteria. The overall validation of the finished product manufacturing process demonstrates 
that the process is consistent throughout the different steps.  
Vials and stoppers are washed and sterilised at the finished product manufacturing site. Validation data 
are provided for the depyrogenating oven and the autoclave. This is found acceptable.  
Results from filter validation of the PVDF sterilising filter are presented including results for microbial 
retention capacity. An in-use simulation exposure study was performed on the sterilising filter to 
investigate potential leachables. There were no extractable and leachable compounds from the filter 
that would pose any safety concern. For the 24-hour compatibility study, no visible changes to the 
filter were observed and the filter integrity testing met the requirements. No sorption of the solution 
during the finished product sterile filtration step was observed 
Results from transport validation studies have been presented both for “bulk vial” and “end-customer”. 
Controls will be in place to ensure the transport times and temperatures are monitored. The studies 
have been performed using water as simulated finished product, this is found acceptable since the 
study focused on the ability to maintain the frozen state.  
Product specification  
The finished product specifications include tests for identification, strength, potency, purity, safety and 
general properties.  
The new receptor binding method was introduced in the finished product specification. During the 
procedure, appropriate acceptance criteria for the Receptor binding assay have been proposed and 
accepted.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in 
the finished product specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 20/207 
 
 
  
  
 
It is recommended (quality recommendation) that an updated risk evaluation on the potential presence 
of nitrosamine impurities in Elzonris (tagraxofusp) is conducted within six months of the marketing 
authorisation. In the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk 
evaluation, confirmatory testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive 
methods within a year after the marketing authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If 
nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be 
implemented. 
No new impurities are introduced as a consequence of finished product manufacture or storage. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The non-compendial methods used to 
determine strength, potency and purity are identical to the active substance analytical methods.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on 11 finished product batches including 4 PPQ batches were provided. Results 
were within the acceptance criteria and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. These data 
also demonstrate consistency and reproducibility of the manufacture across the 2 different processes. 
Reference materials 
The working reference standard used for testing and release of tagraxofusp finished product is the 
same as the one used for the active substance. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf-life of 2 years when stored at the recommended temperature of -20°C ± 5°C is proposed for 
the finished product. 
Stability finished product lots were packaged in a container closure system representative of the 
commercial one. The analytical procedures used in stability-monitoring program are the analytical 
procedures used for batch analysis. 
Since comparability between active substance processes B and C has been sufficiently demonstrated, 
the finished product stability data provided for Process B to date is found acceptable and supportive. 
All future stability protocols will include potency assessment via the current cytotoxic potency assay. 
Additionally, the method will be added to future timepoints for ongoing stability studies presented in 
the dossier. 
Based on the available stability data, a shelf-life of 2 years when stored in the outer carton, at the 
recommended temperature of -20°C ± 5°C is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The active substance, tagraxofusp protein is a fusion protein manufactured via microbial fermentation 
utilizing recombinant E. coli host cells. The data provided are satisfactory concerning the viral 
adventitious aspect.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics. 
During the procedure five major objections were raised on the quality aspects and GMP aspects 
(comparability of active substance manufactured with the proposed commercial process and active 
substance used for clinical trials, control strategy, presence of trace amounts of visible particles 
observed in the finished during development and the potency method). Data have been submitted by 
the applicant during the procedure in relation to these MOs and the CHMP has considered that these 
data is acceptable to resolve them. 
One commitment remains regarding the assessment of the outstanding issues: 
The update of the results of the ongoing investigation to explain the observed overall lower receptor 
binding activity relative to reference material is still outstanding and is not available until January 
2021. The data should be provided as indicated. Potential impact of the conclusions of this 
investigation should be considered for active substance and finished product release and shelf life 
specifications for receptor binding. The applicant proposes to discuss a potential revision of the active 
substance and finished product release and shelf life specifications via a post-approval variation. This is 
supported. A complete commitment should be provided and this issue is put forward as a quality 
recommendation. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable. Physicochemical and biological aspects have 
been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
The update of the results of the ongoing investigation to explain the observed overall lower receptor 
binding activity of commercial active substance and finished product relative to reference material 
should be provided. Potential impact of the conclusions of this investigation should be considered for 
active substance and finished product release and shelf life specifications for receptor binding via a 
post-approval variation.  
It is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in Elzonris 
(tagraxofusp) is conducted within six months of the marketing authorisation. In the event that a risk of 
presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing should be 
carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within a year after the marketing 
authorisation or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be 
present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented.

Main findings 
Tagraxofusp bound selectively to human IL-3Rα (Kd=470 nM) and not 
to mouse IL-3Rα, likely due to the low amino acid sequence homology 
between human and mouse IL-3. 
Tagraxofusp has high affinity for the human IL-3R (Kd=1.5 ± 0.7 nM). 
The ADP-ribosylation activity of tagraxofusp AT-1 and AT-2 batches is 
similar to that of DT388GM-CSF. 
Tagraxofusp is cytotoxic against TF/H-ras cells (IC50 values of 6.1 pM 
and 8.7 pM for AT-1 and AT-2, respectively). 
Tagraxofusp induces apoptosis in leukemic blasts from AML patients. 
Percentage of apoptosis was proportional to the relative expression of 
the IL-3R components on the patient samples. 
DPH1, an enzyme involved in the conversion of His715 to diphthamide 
on EF-2 is a biomarker of acquired resistance to tagraxofusp and that 
downregulation of DPH1 expression is sufficient to mediate in vitro 
tagraxofusp resistance in BPDCN and AML cell lines. Furthermore, 
tagraxofusp resistance is reversible by azacytidine, suggesting that 
downregulation of DPH1 expression occurs through reversible promoter 
cytidine-phosphate guanosine DNA methylation.

Tagraxofusp induces apoptosis in leukemic blasts from patients with AML 
in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In vitro treatment with 
tagraxofusp did not markedly reduce CD123 expression on primary AML

Tagraxofusp reduced GEN2.2 and CAL-1(BPDCN patient-derived cell line) 
cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values in the low 
femtomolar range. 
Primary BPDCN cells obtained at relapse after chemotherapy retained 
their sensitivity to tagraxofusp as compared with cells obtained at time 
of diagnosis likely due to continued expression of CD123 at both 
diagnosis and relapse. 
BPDCN cells were more sensitive to tagraxofusp exposure than were 
cells from patients with AML or ALL. 
Tagraxofusp binds to the human IL-3R with high affinity (Urieto, 2004), and this binding is specific to 
human  CD123  but  not  to  mouse  CD123  (Stemline  Therapeutics,  2018).  The  cytotoxic  activity  of 
tagraxofusp stems from its ability to inactivate EF-2 through ADP-ribosylation (Urieto, 2004) and induce 
apoptosis in CD123-expressing cells (Testa, 2005; Mani, 2018). Tagraxofusp exhibits antitumor activity 
against both BPDCN and AML cell lines and primary patient cells in vitro, with half maximal inhibitory

Tagraxofusp significantly increases median overall survival, from 17 
days in control mice to 58 ± 2 days in treated mice (p<0.001). 
Tagraxofusp reduces the number of human BPDCN cells in the 
peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow of mice implanted with 
human BPDCN cells. 
One cycle of tagraxofusp increases PFS (48 days in tagraxofusp-
treated mice vs 12 days in vehicle-treated mice, p<0.0001). 
Tagraxofusp re-treatment upon relapse induces second and third 
peripheral blood remissions. 
Tagraxofusp significantly increases overall survival of treated mice 
compared with those treated with the vehicle control (p=0.0069). 
Tagraxofusp reduces tumour burden in the bone marrow of treated 
mice. 
Tagraxofusp  treatment  eliminated  leukemic  cells  and  extends  survival  in  immunodeficient  mice 
implanted with human BPDCN and AML cells (Angelot-Delettre, 2015; Christie, 2015; Mani, 2018). 
Interspecies differences for IL-3 and CD123 
A homology analysis of the amino acid sequence for IL-3 and CD123 from different species was conducted 
using  the  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLAST)  from  the  National  Center  for  Biotechnology 
Information (Bethesda, MD).  
Table  3  lists  the  amino  acid  sequence  homology  and  identity  between  hIL-3,  which  is  the  targeting 
domain of tagraxofusp, and IL-3 from the indicated species.

Table  4  lists  the  amino  acid  sequence  homology  and  identity  between  CD123  from  humans  and  the 
indicated species. Human IL-3 has been shown to bind to cynomolgus monkey IL-3R, and this species 
was  previously  chosen  as  the  definitive  toxicology  model  due  to  in  vitro  binding  characteristics  and 
because human IL-3 induces myeloid cells expressing cynomolgus IL-3R (Cohen, 2004; van Gils, 1994). 
IL-3  and  CD123  from  cynomolgus  monkey  and  human  have  a  much  greater  amino  acid  sequence 
homology and identity than any other species assessed, including rodent.

To confirm the species divergence of IL-3 and CD123 proteins, applicant conducted a non-GLP in vitro 
surface plasmon resonance-based binding assay to examine tagraxofusp binding to human and mouse 
CD123 (see in Table 4). For comparison and control, native IL-3 proteins from the respective species 
were  also  assessed.  The  findings  indicated  that  tagraxofusp  displays  concentration-dependent, 
reproducible  binding  to  the  human  CD123  and  does  not  bind  mouse  CD123  under  any  of  the  testing 
conditions. The binding of tagraxofusp to rat, dog, and rabbit CD123 was not performed due to lack of 
commercially  available  reagents  and  because  of  the  large  divergence  in  sequence  homology  between 
human CD123 and these respective species. Previous studies have shown that human IL-3 can bind to 
cynomolgus monkey IL-3R and induce myeloid cells expressing cynomolgus IL-3R (Cohen, 2004; van 
Gils, 1994).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary PD studies were conducted by the applicant, the literature data has been submitted 
instead (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
The table 5 below presents literature references on CD123 expression on normal cells.

Additionally, it is stated in Urieto 2004 that binding of tagraxofusp to normal human tissues was 
evaluated in vitro by immunohistochemistry of frozen tissue sections fixed onto slides and no reactivity 
with tagraxofusp was observed in tissue from human BM, cerebellum, spinal cord, lung, heart, skeletal 
muscle, spleen, liver, pancreas, stomach, breast, adrenal gland, colon, kidney, urinary bladder, and 
skin, whereas detectable reactivity was observed with TF/H-ras cells that express high-affinity IL-3Rs. 
Other malignancies than BPDCN that are known to express CD123 include myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS), certain myeloproliferative neoplasms, chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), both B- and T-
cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin disease, and 
certain aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas. CD123 is also expressed on the CSCs of AML, MDS, and 
CML. CD123 is also found on pDCs in the bone marrow microenvironment of certain malignancies 
including multiple myeloma (MM) and certain myeloproliferative neoplasms. A similar finding has been 
observed in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, where nodules of CD123+ pDCs were noted in the 
bone marrow as well as at extramedullary sites.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Stand-alone studies to evaluate the potential effects of tagraxofusp on organ system function have not 
been conducted. As part of the MPI-2231-002 Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose toxicity study 
and  the  MPI-2231-007  GLP  repeat-dose,  multiple  cycle  toxicity  study  of  tagraxofusp  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys, electrocardiogram examinations were conducted. In the 1-month study, ECGs were performed 
on all animals pre-test and at 1 to 2 hours post-dose on Days 1 and 4 and prior to recovery necropsy.  
There were no tagraxofusp-related effects on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters at any time-
point. The estimated tagraxofusp plasma concentrations at 2 hours post dose on Days 1 and 5 were 24 
and  37  ng/mL  at  30  µg/kg,  and  44  and  141  ng/mL  at  60  µg/kg.  In  the  3-month  study,  ECGs  were 
performed on all animals pre-test and pre-dose on Days 29 and 56. There were no tagraxofusp-related 
effects on qualitative or quantitative ECG parameters at any time-point. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No formal drug-drug interactions have been conducted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics  
No PK dedicated studies were performed. Evaluation of toxicokinetic parameters and anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs) was performed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys and are 
presented below. In these studies, the blood samples were obtained in potassium EDTA anticoagulant 
tubes from a contralateral vein (sampling site was away from the site of administration). Samples were 
obtained as early as 1 minute after the completion of a slow 5-minute IV bolus dose.  
Toxicokinetics were assessed after the first, second, and/or fifth doses and, in 1 study (pivotal 
toxicity/TK study), during three 28-day dosing cycles. In each study, a serial blood sampling plan was 
executed to collect samples for up to 4 hours after dosing to document exposure and characterise the 
distribution and elimination phases of tagraxofusp TK. Additional blood samples were collected to 
assess the presence of anti tagraxofusp reactive antibodies, also known as (ADA). The ADA assay 
results were used to screen the animals before selection for the nonclinical studies and for the 
detection of an immunological response to tagraxofusp during the study. 
In addition, one PK “bioequivalence” study in cynomolgus monkeys has been performed as presented 
below. 
Absorption  
No absorption studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp. Tagraxofusp is administered by IV 
injection and absorption (systemic bioavailability) is 100% via this route. 
As mentioned above the PK parameters were obtained mainly in the Studies MPI-2231-002; MPI-2231-
007 (table 6). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 29/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Distribution 
No distribution studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp. The TK characteristics show that 
tagraxofusp has a relatively small volume of distribution (VZ). In repeat-dose GLP studies, the VZ 
following iv administration was between 50.1 ± 7.00 mL/kg (study 2231-002, data from first cycle) 
and up to 82.3±45.5 mL/kg (study 2231-007, data from first cycle). This volume is quite similar to the 
total blood volume (65 mL/kg) for the cynomolgus monkey, suggesting that tagraxofusp is not 
extensively distributed outside the systemic blood circulation compartment. In the 3-month study, the 
volume of distribution increased with treatment cycles. 
Metabolism 
No metabolism studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp. 
Excretion 
No excretion studies have been conducted with tagraxofusp. In repeat-dose GLP studies, tagraxofusp 
was rapidly cleared with a mean clearance ranging from 1.21 to 2.02 mL/min/kg. The terminal half-life 
was about 0.5 hours following iv administration. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No in vitro or in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.  
Interspecies comparison 
Monkey  exposure  to  tagraxofusp  has  been  demonstrated  in  TK  studies  to  be  dose-dependent  and  to 
decrease  between  cycles  due  to  the  development  of  ADAs.  Notably  in  both  monkeys  and  humans, 
concentrations of “free” tagraxofusp decrease over time with the continuing administration of the same 
tagraxofusp dose due to the development of reactive tagraxofusp antibodies (ADAs).  
Table  7  presents  the  relative  exposure  multiple  for  systemic  concentrations  of  tagraxofusp  in  animal 
studies compared with that achieved in the human clinical studies. The comparisons are based on Cmax 
and AUC exposure for the first cycle and first dose of 35 or 45 μg/kg in Study MPI-2231-007 (Cycle 1 
Day 1) and for the overall exposure after the highest nonclinical dose (80 μg/kg) in non-GLP Study MPI-
2231-001 to the Cmax and AUC exposure for the first cycle and first dose after doses of 7, 12, or 16 
μg/kg in clinical Study STML-401-0114.

These  comparative  data  showed  that  tagraxofusp  Cmax  exposure  was  at  least  7  to  8.7  times  higher 
during  the  nonclinical  studies  in  monkeys  when  the  monkeys  were  given  a  dose  of  35  or  45  μg/kg 
compared with the tagraxofusp Cmax exposure after a 16 μg/kg dose in humans. 
Tagraxofusp AUC exposure was at least 2.3 to 3 times higher in monkeys given a dose of 35 or 45 μg/kg 
compared with the tagraxofusp AUC exposure after a 16 μg/kg dose in humans. The dose of 80 μg/kg 
in cynomolgus monkeys produced a larger margin of exposure between the monkeys and humans. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
One non-GLP PK study of tagraxofusp in 8 female cynomolgus monkeys was conducted 
(MPI-2231-006). The objective was to assess the systemic exposure after iv administration of 
2 formulations of tagraxofusp, frozen solution versus lyophilised formulation. On 2 separate study days 
48 hours apart, a single tagraxofusp IV infusion (30 µg/kg) was administered using tagraxofusp 
prepared from either a frozen solution formulation or a lyophilised formulation. The administration 
sequence of lyophilised or frozen solution formulations was randomised according to a crossover 
design, and the Cmax and AUC systemic exposure and disposition of tagraxofusp were compared using 
a non-compartmental analysis of tagraxofusp plasma concentrations measured by Eurofins Test 
Method GCL-279. The results are presented below.

(N=16). The mean (±SD) CL was 1.95±0.632 mL/min/kg and the mean (± SD) VZ was

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Four repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed by the applicant in cynomolgus monkeys, two pivotal 
studies (one 1-cycle and one 3-cycle studies, GLP-claimed status) and two non-GLP were also

The  GLP  repeat-dose  studies  have  identified  kidney,  liver,  thymus,  brain  choroid  plexus  and  blood 
manifestations as the main tagraxofusp-related toxicities. All toxicities with exception of decreased body 
weight and the findings in thymus and choroid plexus showed recovery following ceased dosing. Overall, 
the toxicities seemed less pronounced in the 3-month study. 
Genotoxicity 
Studies to address genotoxic potential have not been conducted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Carcinogenicity 
Studies  to  address  carcinogenic  potential  have  not  been  conducted  (see  discussion  on  non-clinical 
aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The  fertility,  early  embryonic  development,  and  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicology  studies  have  not  been 
performed. A literature-based assessment on the potential adverse effects of tagraxofusp on embryo-
foetal development was provided. It focused on the potential adverse effects of targeting the IL3 pathway 
in reproduction and development. The provided data suggest potential effects on foetal haematopoiesis 
through exposure to exogenous IL3 or blockade of IL3 signalling (data not shown). 
Toxicokinetic data  
Monkey (5 days IV administration at 40, 60, and 80 µg/kg/day, MPI-2231-001, non-GLP) 
There were no appreciable differences in the TK profile between male and female animals or between 
the first and fifth doses of tagraxofusp. The mean elimination t1/2 was 28.8 ± 4.0 minutes across all 
doses and all animals; mean plasma clearance (CL) was 1.52 ± 0.28 mL/min/kg and the mean volume 
of distribution (VZ) was 62.2±8.8 mL/kg. The maximum plasma concentration values estimated as 
Ct=0, the back extrapolated concentrations calculated to occur at the end of the 5-minute infusion, 
were 629±64, 1100±213, and 1336±126 ng/mL (N=4 per dose level for 2 animals after both the first 
and fifth doses) for the 40, 60, and 80 µg/kg doses, respectively. Similarly, the AUC0-∞ values were 
23.0±2.9, 47.2±7.2, and 54.0±8.9 µg·min/mL at 40, 60, and 80 µg/kg/day, respectively.

Monkey (1 cycle of 5 days IV administration at 30 and 60 µg/kg/day followed by ~ 21 days recovery, 
MPI-2231-002, GLP) 
There were no substantial differences in the TK profile between male and female animals, but there 
were slight differences (a lower CL and longer t1/2) between the fifth versus first doses. The mean CL 
across both doses and animals was 1.21±0.304 mL/min/kg, the mean VZ was 50.1±7.0 mL/kg, and 
the mean elimination t1/2 was 29.9±6.72 minutes. The elimination t1/2 of tagraxofusp is short relative 
to the interval between consecutive QD doses. Therefore, there was no accumulation of the drug. The 
tagraxofusp plasma concentrations at the end of dose administration, Ct=0, were similar for the first 
and fifth doses. There was a small increase in the t1/2 of tagraxofusp corresponding to a small decrease 
in CL of tagraxofusp and reflected in an increase in the AUC between the fifth versus the first dose. 
This change is noted in the means and was observed in almost all individual animals.

Animals were sampled for ADA analysis (Eurofins Test Method GCL-320) prior to dosing and on Days 
14 and 28 (i.e. during the recovery phase). No pre-existing ADAs were detected at randomisation and 
all control animals remained negative for ADAs throughout the study. Samples from animals given 
tagraxofusp at 60 µg/kg were all (n=3) reported as ADA-positive at Days 14 and 28. As shown in Table 
14 Tier 2b inhibition by excess DT ranged from 7.7% to 94.2%, and Tier 2b inhibition by excess hIL-3 
ranged from 1.3% to 75.9%. Tier 3 titres ranged from 1/32 to 1/1024. Based on these ADA Tier 2b 
results for domain specificity, monkey #219 predominantly had an antibody response against the DT 
domain, monkey #221 predominantly had an antibody response against the hIL-3 domain, and 
monkey #226 displayed antibodies against both DT and hIL-3 domains of tagraxofusp.

Monkey (3 cycles of 5 days IV administration at 35 and 45 µg/kg/day followed by ~ 21 days recovery, 
MPI-2231-007, GLP) 
Tagraxofusp plasma concentrations declined mono-exponentially after administration as a 5-minute IV 
infusion to each animal. Even though the doses were administered based upon the individual animal’s 
body weight, the exposure in the male cynomolgus monkeys was higher than the exposure for the 
female animals. Average exposure in female animals based upon the female:male AUC ratio was about 
62% to 92% of the exposure observed in male animals. Higher concentrations in male animals were 
consistently observed throughout the study although inter-animal variability in the exposure was large 
(coefficient of variation ranging from 7.7% to 78.5%). The large variability among all animals 
suggested that tagraxofusp plasma concentration exposure was likely not statistically or meaningfully 
different.  
Average tagraxofusp plasma concentration exposure was higher for the 45 µg/kg dose compared with 
that for the 35 µg/kg dose. Higher plasma concentration exposure in the 45 µg/kg dose group 
persisted throughout the study. However, regardless of dose, plasma concentration exposure 
decreased between cycles, with the second and third cycles demonstrating progressively lower 
exposure. The t1/2 of tagraxofusp did not change remarkably between the cycles, being consistently 
about 0.5 hours in most cases, whereas both CL and the VZ appeared to increase. The notable 
decrease in tagraxofusp plasma concentration exposure as the cycles progressed is attributed to a 
time-dependent increase in the development of ADAs. From the tagraxofusp Cmax and AUC exposure 
data, it appears that there was an immunogenic response to the administration of tagraxofusp that 
increased over time, resulting in lower systemic Cmax and AUC exposure in the animals in the second 
and third cycles. Each dosing cycle had progressively lower systemic exposure to the point that by 
cycle 3, on Day 58, the number of data points with measurable tagraxofusp concentrations did not 
permit the assessment of PK parameters.  
The ELISA assay (Test Method GCL-279) of tagraxofusp in monkey plasma was designed for 
quantification of “free” (ie, not antibody-bound) tagraxofusp in plasma. The observed decrease in 
tagraxofusp exposure in the second and third cycles, therefore, only relates to unbound, i.e., “free,” 
tagraxofusp. While not measured, it is possible that ADA-bound tagraxofusp may persist longer and 
possibly may reflect the rate of turnover of the antibodies. The increase in ADAs did not appear to

impact the t1/2 of tagraxofusp in monkeys, suggesting that the ADAs did not impact the elimination 
process of unbound tagraxofusp.  
There was a substantial increase in both the CL and the VZ of tagraxofusp. The consistent elimination 
t1/2 of the free tagraxofusp plasma concentrations suggests that the ratio of CL/VZ remained relatively 
constant across the 3 cycles of dosing. The changes in PK parameters and exposure of tagraxofusp 
over time suggest that the formation of ADAs likely interfered with the measurement of free 
tagraxofusp in plasma due to ADA binding.

Note: Pharmacokinetic parameters on Study Day 58 are not summarised because the tagraxofusp plasma concentration time data 
were insufficient to permit calculations.  
Samples for ADA analysis were obtained before dosing and on Days 14, 26, 53, and 68 and assessed 
by Eurofins Test Method GCL-320.  
It should be noted that Test Method GCL-320 possesses an unusually high confirmatory cut point (80% 
inhibition); confirmatory cut points are typically in the 15% to 30% inhibition range. Before performing 
the cut point analysis, a scientific review of the assay signals and percent inhibition values for 
51 normal monkey serum samples was performed by scientists representing the sponsor and the 
statisticians performing the statistical analyses. After the review, 36 of the 51 samples were 
considered to be antibody-positive and the remaining 15 samples were classified as antibody-negative. 
The observed high rate of pre-existing antibodies in the monkey population is not unexpected due to 
exposure to DT and subsequent conversion to antibody-positive. The 15 antibody-negative samples 
were used in this cut point analysis. For Study MPI-2231-007, the vehicle-treated monkeys all had 
baseline responses around 100 relative light units, which suggests a very low level of pre-existing 
ADAs. Thus, this finding suggests the originally computed confirmatory cut point (80% inhibition) may 
not be appropriate for this group of animals.  
The monkeys in the 2 groups treated with either 35 or 45 µg/kg/day exhibited an increase in ADAs 
that was notable by Study Day 14. High ADA response in the Tier 1 assay continued throughout the 
study in the treated animals. Monkeys in the control group exhibited no detectable ADAs throughout 
the study.  
Assessment report

Page 45/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
ADAs were detected in 5 of 12 animals that received tagraxofusp at any point in the study (Table 15). 
Titres ranged from 1:2048 to 1:256. Four of the 7 positive ADA samples were observed at the 
35 µg/kg dose level, while the remaining 3 positive samples were observed at the 45 µg/kg dose level. 
Titres were typically similar between the 35 and 45 µg/kg dose levels. Six of the 7 samples that were 
positive for ADAs occurred in males. Only 2 animals (Animals 2003 and 3003) on the study had 
detectable ADAs at more than 1 timepoint (Day 14 and Day 26) and both animals were male. When 
detected, ADAs were typically observed on Day 14 or 26. Antidrug antibodies in 1 animal were 
detected on Day 53 (Animal 3002; 45 µg/kg dose level male). The presence of ADAs was not 
detectable in any samples on Day 68.

The proposed clinical dose for marketing approval is 12 µg/kg for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.  
In humans, a dose of 12 µg/kg tagraxofusp produced a Cmax of 66.7±66.7 ng/mL and an AUC0-∞ of 
142±92.0 ng·h/mL on cycle 1 Day 1 (N=80 patients). 
Human exposure (Cmax and AUC) to tagraxofusp has been demonstrated in clinical studies to be 
dose-dependent and to decrease by cycle 3 due to the development of ADAs. Similarly, monkey 
exposure to tagraxofusp has been demonstrated in TK studies to be dose-dependent and to decrease 
between cycles due to the development of ADAs. Therefore, the aspects of dose-dependent exposure 
and time-dependent ADA effects make the comparative exposure in monkeys and humans more 
complicated. Table 17 shows the relative exposure multiple for systemic concentrations of tagraxofusp 
in animal studies compared with that achieved in the human clinical studies. The comparisons are 
based on Cmax and AUC exposure for the Day 1 exposure in the 1- and 3-month studies to the Cmax and 
AUC exposure for the first cycle and first dose after doses of 7, 12, or 16 µg/kg in clinical study

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted a justification for omitting an environmental risk assessment studies 
stating that tagraxofusp being a fusion protein is expected to be removed by the following common 
pathways: degradation by proteolysis, nonspecific endocytosis, or target-mediated clearance, and 
further metabolized into component peptides and amino acids. As a consequence, metabolism studies 
have not been performed. 
In view of the fact that tagraxofusp is a protein, the expected metabolism, the rarity of the indicated 
condition and taking into account the drug product excipients (tromethamine, sodium chloride, sorbitol 
(E420), water for injections), environmental risk assessment studies are considered not to be required, 
and the environmental risk is considered to be negligible. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical safety profile of tagraxofusp has been characterized in vitro and in vivo pharmacological, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies in mice and in monkeys. This nonclinical development program 
was designed in accordance with ICH S9 and ICHS6 guidelines, regarding the treatment of patients with 
advanced cancer and is sufficient to support marketing authorization of tagraxofusp in BPDCN patients. 
The pharmacological profile of tagraxofusp was demonstrated in in vitro assays and in in vivo BPDCN 
model xenografted in rodents. The proof of concept was demonstrated, including apoptosis of BPDCN by 
tagraxofusp  and  increase  in  overall  survival  in  xenografted  mice.  No  studies  have  been  submitted  to 
validate the species selection and to characterize the binding affinity in monkey compared to human and 
consequently to determine the relevance of the species to clinical pharmacological activity and toxicology 
Given however the complete lack of binding observed between tagraxofusp and mouse CD123 together 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 47/207 
 
 
  
  
 
with the low amino acid sequence homology between CD123 from humans versus CD123 from mouse, 
rat, dog, and rabbit it is unlikely that tagraxofusp binds to CD123 from these species. Taken together, 
these data showed that the cynomolgus monkey is the only pharmacodynamically relevant species for 
nonclinical toxicology testing. 
No secondary PD studies were conducted by the applicant. Instead a literature review has been 
presented. In normal tissue, CD123 expression is limited and includes high expression on pDCs and 
basophils; moderate to low expression on monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells, eosinophils, and mast 
cells; and low to absent expression on haematopoietic stem cells 
PK  profile  of  tagraxofusp  has  been  evaluated  in  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  after  intravenous 
administration  for  5  consecutive  days  per  cycle  in  from  one-  to  three-cycles  treatment  regimen  in 
monkeys.  Globally  tagraxofusp  shows  approximate  dose  proportional  exposure  and  no  appreciable 
differences in the TK profile between male and female. CL and Vz appeared to increase after repeated 
cycles. Exposure decreased dramatically after the second cycle and almost no exposure was observed in 
the third cycle due to presence of ADA. 
No  formal  drug-drug  interactions  have  been  conducted.  Given  the  highly  selective  binding  affinity 
between human IL-3 and human IL-3R, pharmacodynamic drug interactions would not be expected for 
any concomitant medication. 
At human equivalent doses greater than or equal to 1.6 times the recommended dose based on body 
surface area, severe kidney tubular degeneration/necrosis was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. At 
human equivalent doses equal to the recommended dose, degeneration/necrosis of the choroid plexus 
in the brain was observed in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings were generally noted after 5 days of 
daily dosing. The reversibility of this finding was not assessed at lower doses, but the finding was 
irreversible and became progressively more severe at a human equivalent dose 1.6 times the 
recommended dose, 3 weeks after dosing stopped.  It is unknown if these findings are CD123 
receptor-mediated or non-receptor mediated effects since binding of tagraxofusp to cynomolgus 
monkey CD123 has not been demonstrated. These findings in kidney and choroid plexus are 
considered likely relevant for the clinical situation. 
The CHMP and PRAC requested additional pharmacovigilance activity in the RMP: 
Immunohistochemistry staining of brain tissue samples from non-clinical Study MPI 2231 007 to 
address the Important potential risk of 'Choroid plexus lesions’ (however, the issues identified in the 
application prevent recommending granting a marketing authorisation). 
Moreover,  it  seems  likely  that  study  animals  had  no  existing  anti-tagraxofusp  antibodies  at  start  of 
administration. As the histopathological findings observed in the choroid plexus, liver, and kidney were 
seen  after  only  five  consecutive  dose  administrations,  involvement  of  ADAs/immuncomplexes  seem 
unlikely. The toxicities observed in these organs could be driven by target binding-mediated effects, DT-
mediated effects, or some combination of the above. However, immunocomplexes may potentially be 
involved in exacerbation of the findings.  
No  genotoxicity  or  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  ICH  S6  guideline,  it  is 
endorsed. Tagraxofusp is a recombinant protein and is therefore not expected to interact directly with 
DNA.  
Further non-clinical reprotoxicity studies are not warranted. A literature-based risk assessment suggests 
that exposure to exogenous IL-3 or blockade of IL-3 signaling may have embryotoxic effects on foetal 
haematopoiesis and embryo-foetal development. The effects of diphtheria toxin exposure on placental 
and embryo-foetal development are unknown.  Elzonris should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical  condition  of  the  woman  requires  treatment  with  tagraxofusp.  It  is  unknown  whether 
tagraxofusp/metabolites  are  excreted  in  human  milk.  A  risk  to  newborns/infants  cannot  be  excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 48/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Elzonris and for at least one week after the 
last dose. 
The CHMP agreed with the applicant that tagraxofusp being a fusion protein is expected to be removed 
by the common pathways: degradation by proteolysis, nonspecific endocytosis, or target-mediated 
clearance, and further metabolized into component peptides and amino acids. Furthermore, in light of 
the rarity of the indicated condition and taking into account the drug product excipients tagraxofusp is 
not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacodynamic data showed tagraxofusp affinity for IL3-R and antitumor activity in vitro and in 
vivo on BPDCN cells. The PK profile is well documented and supports its pharmacological and toxicological 
evaluations  in  the  selected  preclinical  species.  The  toxicological  program  designed  in  accordance  with 
ICH S9 guideline and ICH S6 guideline, allowed to identify main target organs toxicities in monkey. Most 
of the adverse effects showed in animals can be monitored in human.  
Overall,  it  is  considered  that  the  toxicological  package  available  with  tagraxofusp  is  adequate  for  the 
proposed indication and is in line with ICH S9 and ICH S6 guidelines.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology investigations have been performed in 4 clinical studies of patients with 
haematological malignancies (AML, BPDCN, MM, HRMPN), BPDCN, where study STML-401-0114 is the 
pivotal study performed in both AML and BPDCN patients (Table 19). 
Table 19. Clinical Pharmacology Studies

Full PK sampling has been performed at several occasions. PK data from the four studies were pooled 
using a population PK analysis (independent of the indication). Exposure-response (ER) analysis was 
restricted to PK/PD data from BPDCN patients and all patients respectively for ER-efficacy and ER-
safety. 
Methods 
•  Bioanalysis 
The applied analytical method to quantify free tagraxofusp in human plasma samples with K2EDTA as 
anticoagulant,  has  been  developed  in  two  US  sites  and  validated  according  to  the  FDA  Guideline 
(“Bioanalytical method validation Guidance for Industry”). Pooled plasma for use as blank or control in 
assay  methodology  typically  has  anti-DT  due  to  the  near  ubiquitous  use  of  diphtheria  immunization. 
Therefore,  beagle  plasma  was  employed  as  a  surrogate  matrix  for  preparation  of  standard  curves.  A 
cross-validation study has been performed between the two methods. Results of this analysis showed 
that between Eurofins and the two BDS sites more than 85% of the samples met the acceptance criteria 
whereas 100% of the samples show good agreement within BDS sites.  
No study was performed to assess the extent of interferences coming from binding to target present in 
patients’ plasma or parallelism of the analytical method.  
•  Anti-drug antibody analysis 
Four  distinct  assays  were  developed  and  validated  to  support  investigation  of  the  immunogenicity  of 
tagraxofusp in patients during clinical trials. These methods are summarised as follows: 
1  Anti-tagraxofusp  antibodies 
(ADA)  were  assessed  and 
titre  evaluated 
in  an 
electrochemiluminescent  (ECL)  bridging  immunoassay  using  the  mesoscale  discovery  (MSD) 
system. This method captures antibodies formed towards both functional domains (DT and hIL3) 
of  tagraxofusp  and  the  method  testing  strategy  included  domain  specificity  binding 
characterisation involving competitive inhibition with hIL3 and DT separately. 
2  Tagraxofusp  neutralising  antibodies  (NAb)  were  assessed  in  a  cell-based  assay  using  IL-3 
receptor expressing erythroleukemic cells (FT-1-Hras) that detect the presence of NAb in ADA 
positive  samples  by  their  ability  to  attenuate  cytotoxicity  induced  by  exogenous  tagraxofusp. 
The  resulting  effect  is  assessed  by  measuring  viability  using  a  detection  substrate.  The  assay 
design was based upon a cytotoxicity assay used to assess potency. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 51/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
3  A direct-binding ELISA was used for specific detection and titre evaluation of antibodies to the 
hIL-3  domain  (AIA)  of  tagraxofusp  in  patient  sera  as  a  robust  antibody  response  to  the  DT 
domain  of  tagraxofusp  had  the  potential  to  complicate  detection  of  low  levels  of  treatment-
induced or treatment-boosted antibodies to human IL-3 (hIL) in the ADA assay. 
4  The neutralising ability of the anti-hIL-3 antibody positive samples (hIL-3 NAb) were assessed 
in a cell-based assay in which growth factor dependent TF-1 cells are stimulated to proliferate 
by  addition  of  hIL-3.  If  serum  anti-hIL-3  antibodies  are  neutralising,  the  cells  will  exhibit 
decreased viability signal using a detection substrate. 
The methods have been validated following recommendations in current guidelines and white papers 
and included cross testing to assess assay performance after assay transfer. All requirements and 
criteria stated in the protocol were met. The methods were found suitable for assessment of 
tagraxofusp immunogenicity. The drug tolerance established for all four methods were well above 
estimated serum levels of circulating tagraxofusp at the time of immunogenicity sampling. 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
Tagraxofusp is administered as an intravenous infusion.  
Bioequivalence 
The intended commercial formulation (frozen solution) has been used for the clinical studies included in 
this MAA. In study 0114, doses of 7, 9, 12, or 16 μg/kg tagraxofusp were administered via 15-minute 
intravenous infusion, using a frozen solution formulation. A small number of subjects received 15-
minute infusions using a lyophilised powder formulation. Because of the small number of subjects who 
received the lyophilized powder formulation (N=7) and because of the large measurement variability in 
the data, no conclusions are made concerning the comparative PK of the lyophilized powder 
formulation and the frozen liquid formulation. 
Distribution 
The mean tagraxofusp volume of distribution is 5.1 L (SD of 1.9) in patients with BPDCN and have been 
estimated from 4 patients which were ADA negative at C1D1 as shown in Table 20 (PK values estimated 
in 4 patients : AUCinf, CL, Vz and T1/2; PK values estimated in 5 patients: Cmax Tmax, AUClast).

subjects with BPDCN on C1D1 
Immunogenicity 
Of the 95 PK evaluable subjects only 5 had no detectable ADA at baseline. 
Free SL-401 exposure showed a titer-dependant reduction with increasing ADA measured at baseline as 
shown  in  Table  21  below.  A  significant  effect  of  ADA  titer  on  C1D1  AUClast  was  observed  (p  <0.01). 
Distribution of the titers was considerably shifted from C1D1 to C3D1.

Consequence of ADA titer on PK parameters is highlighted in Table 22 where, as ADA titer increases from 
ADA negative status to ADA positive (titer 800), Vz increased from 5.11 to 21.9 L.

Elimination 
ADA negative 
After end of infusion, SL-401 decreased rapidly following a monoexponential decline with a mean terminal 
half-life of 0.7 (SD 0.3) hours. Mean Clearance was estimated at 7.16 L/h (Table 12).  
ADA positive 
After accounting for ADA status, as ADA titer increase from ADA negative status to ADA positive (titre 
800), terminal half-life, CL increased from 0.714 h to 1.32h and 7.16 to 12.2 L/h respectively. 
Excretion 
SL-401 is a recombinant fusion protein with a molecular weight of 58 kDa, which is considered to be 
degraded into amino acids.  
Metabolism 
No metabolite studies have been performed. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Formal dose proportionality could not be assessed due to significant titre-dependent influence of ADA 
and  the  variable  distribution  of  ADA  titre  at  baseline  across  the  dose  groups.  Table  23  presents  key 
exposure metrics for patients with BPDCN and AML (Study 0114).

Table 23. Free Tagraxofusp exposure following IV dose of 7,9,12 and 16 µg/kg on Day 1 and 
5 of Cycles 1 and 3 
From 7 to 16 µg/kg at C1D1, Cmax increased with dose from 29.1 to 78.5 µg/L except for the dosing 
group (9 µg/kg) which is highlight on Figure 1, AUClast increased too with dose from 44.8 to 118 µg.h/L.  
Time dependency 
According to Table 23, for all dosing groups (7/9/12/16 µg/kg) both exposure parameters AUClast and 
Cmax increased between C1D1 to C1D5. For the 12 µg/kg dosing groups Cmax increased from 66.4 to 
77.1 µg/L and AUClast from 82.8 to 115 µg.h/L. 
However, between C1D1 and C3D1, both exposure parameters AUClast and Cmax were decreased from 
66.4 to 2.42 µg/L and 82.8 to 1.42 µg.h/L, likely due treatment boosted or treatment emergent ADA. 
For  patients  with  BPDCN,  Table  24  summarises  key  exposure  metrics  for  free  SL-401  concentration 
following IV dose of 12 µg/kg/day, whereas Table 25 lists a summary of key disposition parameters.

Table  25.  Free  SL-401  Pharmacokinetics  parameters  following  IV  dose  of  12  µg/kg/day  in 
Patients with BPDCN 
The data showed a large variability between the first and following doses, which is a result of 
measuring the free tagraxofusp and the presence of pre-existing and treatment emerging or boosted 
ADAs. 
Intra- and Inter-individual variability 
For patients with BPDCN, irrespective of the ADA status, at C1D1 the %CV was 92% for Cmax and 92.7% 
for AUClast. The %CV was 141 % for CL and 127% for Vz. For patients with BPDCN, ADA negative, at 
C1D1 the %CV was 35.8% for Cmax and 71% for AUClast. The %CV was 100% for CL and 36.4% for 
Vz. 
No stratification by target level was performed due to the unavailability of a suitable analytical method. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Study STML 401 0114 
Study STML 401 0114 was a Phase I/II non-randomized, open-label, multistage, dose-escalation and 
expansion study in patients with BPDCN or AML. At enrolment cut-off (17 Mar 2017), 96 patients had 
been recruited.  
Tagraxofusp was administered as a 15-minute IV infusion for the first 5 consecutive days of a 21-day 
cycle. Tagraxofusp was supplied as frozen solution (1 mg/mL) for Stages 1, 2, and 3. A lyophilised 
formulation (lyophilised powder, for solution; 1 mg/mL) was supplied for dosing in selected patients 
with AML in Stage 2 and is planned for treatment of BPDCN patients enrolled in Stage 4. 
The stages were carried out as follows: 
-  Stage 1: 23 patients (9 BPDCN and 14 AML) were treated with Tagraxofusp Injection at doses 
of 7, 9, 12, or 16 μg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days every 21 days. The 16 μg/kg/day dose was 
evaluated only in patients with AML. 
-  Stage 2: 58 (35 AML patients and 23 BPDCN) patients were treated at 12 μg/kg/day, the MTD, 
at which multiple DLTs were not observed during Stage 1.  
-  Stage 3: 13 first-line BPDCN patients were treated at 12 μg/kg/day and contribute as the 
pivotal cohort. 
-  Stage 4: 2 BPDCN patients were enrolled as of 17 Mar 2017.  
The results referred to here are for the BPDCN population only, unless noted otherwise.  
Plasma concentrations generally showed rapid monoexponential decline post end of infusion. Individual 
profiles showed considerable heterogeneity in Cmax and the slope of the terminal phase of the 
concentration-time profile. Across all dose levels, many patients had free tagraxofusp concentrations

below the limit of quantitation by 4 hours post dose on C1D1. NCA analysis at C1D1 and C1D5 showed 
increased and highly variable CL and Vz after 5 days.  
Population PK analysis 
An integrated PPK analysis was performed using concentration-time data from all 4 clinical studies of 
tagraxofusp. The objectives of the PPK analysis were to: 1) characterise the PPK of free tagraxofusp in 
patients with AML, BPDCN, relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM), or advanced, high-risk 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN); 2) estimate the between subject and residual variability in free 
tagraxofusp PK; 3) quantify the magnitude of influence of pre-specified covariates on the disposition of 
free tagraxofusp; and 4) to assess the association of ADA (per ECL-IA methodology) and the PK of free 
tagraxofusp. For the purposes of the population PK analysis, the term ADA refers to total ADA (DT-
related immune responses (pre-existing, anamnestic, and treatment-induced) and induced IL-3-related 
immune response).  
The total dataset was divided into three windows: C1D1 data; C1D3-5 data, with day 3 data coming 
solely from study 0314; cycle 3 or 4 (C3-4) data (days 1, 3, or 5). C1D3-5 data was used as the 
reference dataset, given the assumption that ADA was less impactful during this treatment period. 
The SL-401 PK data set was comprised of 127 patients (study 0114 n = 96; study 0214 n = 11; study 
0314 n= 15, study 0414 n = 5), contributing a total of 2920 SL-401 observations. There was a large 
number of below limit of quantitation (BLQ) observations across the four studies (1360 records total, 
1049 records in study 0114, 144 records in study 0214, 149 records in study 0314, and 18 records in 
study 0414), which is almost half of the total number of PK observations. The majority of BLQs 
occurred in treatment cycles 3 or 4 (for study 0314). 
The ﬁnal and most parsimonious model for describing the PK of free SL-401 was a one-compartment 
model with linear clearance. Table 26 shows the PK parameters resulting from this analysis for the 
different studies. Free SL-401 pharmacokinetics appeared to be dose-linear across the range of doses 
and regimens studied. V/F and CL/F increased with baseline weight. 
Table 26. Summary of Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters by Study 
Source: Metrum Research Group Report STM0106F, Table 22 
The PK model also included estimation of the fraction of dose escaping immediate ADA binding in 
plasma (F1). In this context, immediate binding refers to any binding occurring prior to the ﬁrst PK 
sample, leaving less free drug available for venous sampling. The analysis was done in step-wise 
fashion, separately analyzing the three data windows mentioned above (C1D1, C1D3-5, C3-4), with 
the same one-compartment model. Model diagnostic plots indicated general GOF across the data 
windows. 
According to the C1D3/5 model, the fraction of dose escaping immediate binding in plasma, F1, was 
0.50, 0.14, and 0.13 for ADA baseline titres of 800, 8000, and 80000, respectively. Based on model 
Assessment report

Page 57/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
implementation, these values are estimated relative to a titre of 80 (which was fixed at a value of F1 = 
1). Table 27 shows the estimates of F1 for C1D3/5 as well as for C1D1 and Cycle 34. Regardless, the 
estimates reinforce the marked impact of pre-existing, treatment-boosted, and/or treatment-emergent 
ADA on exposure.  
F1 decreased with increasing titer within a given time period, since greater presence of ADA increased 
the immediate ADA binding of SL-401. For a given titer level, F1 also decreased for individuals at C1D1 
or C3-4, relative to C1D35, since there was greater impact of ADA on free SL-401 exposure during 
these time periods.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No formal study were submitted to evaluate the impact of renal impairment on SL-401 PK. Based on the 
results of the PopPK analysis (Reference Model C1D3-5), the population clearance CL/F at the chosen 
reference  ADA  titre  of  80  was  3.7  L/h  (RSE  of  80%).  CL/F  decreased  with  eGFR  (normalised  to  83 
mL/min) according to a power model with exponent estimate of 0.25 (140% RSE). For patients with mild 
(eGFR = 60-89 mL/min) or moderate (eGFR = 30-59 mL/min), no clinically meaning full changes in free 
tagraxofusp AUC were expected. Estimated eGFR ranged from 42 to 158 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the dataset, 
representing a relatively broad range of renal function. 
No data are available for patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. 
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal study were submitted to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment on SL-401 PK.   
The influence of mild hepatic impairment based on the National Cancer Institute-Organ Dysfunction 
Working Group [NCI-ODWG] criteria was evaluated in a post-hoc analysis. The mild impairment group 
Assessment report

included 2 subjects with moderate impairment on C1D1. For C1D1, the estimate of the hepatic 
impairment effect was 60% increase in clearance with a 95% CI (0-140%).  
For C1D3-5, the estimated hepatic impairment effect in tagraxofusp clearance was 98% with a 95%CI 
of  83-120%  which  include  the  100%  value.  No  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  SL-401  clearance  is 
expected. 
Gender 
A  post-hoc  exploratory  analyses  of  the  EBE  of  patient  specific  clearance  random  effects  from  the 
reference PK model (C1D3-5) was performed. In this exploratory assessment, there was no appreciable 
difference between males and females. 
Race 
Results from the PopPK analysis indicated that race seems to have no impact on the available PK 
parameters. 
Weight 
In the primary reference model describing C1D3/5 PK (Metrum Report STM0106F, Table 18, Model 
334), the population CL at the chosen reference ADA titre of 80 was 3.7 (80% relative standard error 
[RSE]) L/h. Clearance increased with body weight (normalised to 70 kg) according to an allometric 
relationship with exponent estimate of 0.99 (78% RSE). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of free tagraxofusp plasma concentrations following 
the first dose of Elzonris, no clinically meaningful changes in free tagraxofusp exposure are expected 
with respect to bodyweight. 
Elderly 
Results from the PopPK analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate of any of the 
available PK parameters

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Tagraxofusp (SL-401, DT388IL3) is intended for treatment of patients with blastic plasmacytoid 
dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) and other haematological malignancies where CD123 is expressed. It 
is a 524-amino acid recombinant fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli, composed of interleukin-
3 (IL-3) and truncated diphtheria toxin (DT, the binding domain of DT is absent). DT inhibits protein 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 59/207 
 
 
  
  
 
synthesis and induces apoptosis in cells expressing the interleukin 3 receptor (IL-3R) which is the 
molecular target for tagraxofusp. Binding of tagraxofusp to IL-3R leads to internalisation of the 
complex and localisation to endosomes where endosomal furin releases the catalytic domain of DT. The 
free catalytic domain of DT enters the cytosol via the translocation domain and inactivates cellular 
protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating the diphthamide residue in domain IV of elongation factor 2 (a 
key protein involved in protein translation). This halts protein synthesis and triggers a series of cellular 
events that culminates in apoptosis of the intoxicated cell. 
The protein is engineered such that the IL-3 domain replaces the native receptor binding domain of 
DT. The applicant claims that tagraxofusp are thereby able to target cells that express CD123 (the 
alpha subunit of IL-3R). CD123 is expressed on both the tumour bulk and cancer stem cells of multiple 
haematological malignancies, including BPDCN and AML, but has limited expression on normal tissue.  
Primary pharmacology 
Exploratory graphical analysis on the PD end-points neutrophils and bone marrow blasts, and efficacy 
end-point mSWAT, was conducted to assess relationships between tagraxofusp exposure and efficacy 
endpoints in subjects with BPDCN, and to also assess the impact of the presence of neutralising ADAs 
against tagraxofusp on the exposure-efficacy relationships. 
The objective of the analyses was to develop an understanding of the underlying tagraxofusp E-R 
relationships for biomarker, efficacy, and safety endpoints in BPDCN and other hematologic 
malignancies. The following biomarker, efficacy and safety measures were analysed in this work: 
• Biomarkers: peripheral blood neutrophil count, blast percentage in bone marrow. 
• Clinical efficacy endpoints: best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or CR clinical 
(CRc), defined as CR with minimal residual skin abnormality, duration of CR/CRc response (DOR), 
and modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT: Extent of skin involvement as measured 
by mSWAT).  
• Adverse events (AEs): hypoalbuminemia, transaminase elevations, and Capillary Leak Syndrome 
(CLS), as captured in adverse event reporting. 
• Laboratory abnormalities: laboratory values for albumin and transaminase elevations based on 
samples collected in Cycle 1 and graded in a manner consistent with Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. 
The PK-efficacy and PK-safety analyses are described below in the section Relationship between 
plasma concentration and effect. 
Methods 
The following efficacy responses and best response values were determined for bone marrow blasts, 
mSWAT and peripheral blood neutrophils: 
• Responses at reference time points are referred to as "landmark" response values. Landmark 
absolute change from baseline values were computed at reference time points corresponding to the 
end of Cycles 1, 2, and 4. 
• For each subject and for each endpoint, the best response value (expressed as change from 
baseline) was computed based on data from all cycles. The PK/PD data set contained baseline 
values for each endpoint; these baseline values were obtained from the source data using records 
labelled as a baseline visit. 
• Neutrophils were sampled more frequently within the treatment cycles compared to the other 
two endpoints. For analysis purposes, the end of cycle assessment for neutrophils was based on 
the last observation within the treatment cycle, with the condition that it must be at least 10 days

after the last dose in the cycle in order to minimize the impact of steroid-induced neutrophil 
increase following the protocol specified co-administration of steroids prior to infusion of 
tagraxofusp. 
Neutralising antibody was evaluated using a covariate named PERNAB in the PK/PD data set. This 
variable represented observed/imputed percent neutralising antibody for tagraxofusp. Imputation was 
carried out using a last observation carried forward method. In some instances the observed percent 
neutralising antibody exceeded 100%, which can be explained by differences in the proliferation 
response of the cell populations used in the bioassay. 
The following graphical displays were generated for each endpoint: 
•  Observed data (all cycles) vs. time 
•  Observed change from baseline (all cycles) vs. time 
•  Best response as change from baseline vs. AUC0-24hr and Cmax (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 5) 
•  End of Cycle 1 change from baseline vs. AUC0-24hr and Cmax (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 5) 
•  End of Cycle 1 change from baseline vs. percent neutralising antibody 
•  End of Cycle 2 change from baseline vs. AUC0-24hr and Cmax (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 5) 
•  End of Cycle 2 change from baseline vs. percent neutralising antibody 
•  End of Cycle 4 change from baseline vs. AUC0-24hr and Cmax (Cycle 1, Days 1 and 5) 
•  End of Cycle 4 change from baseline vs. presence or absence of detectable tagraxofusp levels 
in Cycle 3 
•  End of Cycle 4 change from baseline vs. percent neutralising antibody 
Bone marrow blasts 
Individual time-profiles of bone marrow blasts response are shown in Fig 3. The figure demonstrated 
large inter-individual variability in response over time, but three distinct profiles were extracted from 
the data. Blasts percentages typically decreased from baseline to end of Cycle 1 and then remained 
relatively constant in subsequent cycles. A subset of subjects showed an initial decrease in blasts 
during Cycle 1 followed by an increase and return towards baseline at later cycles. Another subset of 
subjects, generally those with low baseline blasts, exhibited a minimal change from baseline over time. 
Best response vs. Cycle 1, Day 1 AUC0-24hr were conditioned by observed quartiles of baseline blasts. 
No apparent E-R relationship was observed, even if subjects in the highest quartile showed the largest 
reduction in blasts percentage from baseline.

No apparent relationships between response and neutralising antibody were observed. Regarding 
presence or absence of detectable tagraxofusp levels in Cycle 3; subjects with no detectable levels still 
showed a reduction in blasts of similar magnitude to subjects with quantifiable tagraxofusp 
concentrations. 
Peripheral blood neutrophils 
Individual time-profiles of peripheral blood neutrophil responses (change from baseline) are shown in 
fig. 5. The figures showed large inter-individual variability in response over time, but three distinct 
profiles were extracted from the data: 1) steady increase in neutrophils over the treatment cycles; 2) 
initial decrease in neutrophils followed by a return towards baseline at later cycles; and 3) minimal 
change from baseline over time. 
Best response vs. Cycle 1, Day 1 AUC0-24hr were conditioned by observed quartiles of baseline 
neutrophils. The effect size, unlike that observed with bone marrow blasts and mSWAT, did not appear 
to be related to baseline values of the endpoint.

No apparent relationships between response and neutralising ADAs were observed in this or any of the 
cycles. Subjects with no detectable tagraxofusp showed an increase in neutrophils of similar magnitude 
to subjects with quantifiable tagraxofusp concentrations. 
Modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) 
The mSWAT score is a composite scoring system that characterises the skin involvement of three 
different lesion types. Patch, plaque and tumour body surface area are determined and multiplied by a 
factor of 1, 2 and 4, respectively, to establish the mSWAT subtotals (the mSWAT score equals the 
summation of these subtotals). 
Individual time-profiles of mSWAT response (change from baseline) are shown in fig 7. There was 
large inter-individual variability in response over time, but three distinct profiles substantiated. mSWAT 
typically decreased from baseline to end of Cycle 1 and then remained relatively constant in 
subsequent cycles. A subset of subjects showed an initial decrease in mSWAT during Cycle 1 followed 
by an increase and return towards baseline at later cycles. Another subset of subjects, generally those 
with low baseline mSWAT (near 0%), exhibited a minimal change from baseline over time.  
Best response vs. Cycle 1, Day 1 AUC0-24hr were conditioned by observed quartiles of baseline 
mSWAT. No apparent E-R relationship was observed. The effect size did appear to be related to 
baseline mSWAT, as subjects in the highest quartile showed the largest reduction in mSWAT from 
baseline. 
The potential impact of the dominant lesion type on the ER relationship was investigated by 
conditioning the E-R plots for mSWAT by the dominant lesion type at baseline. No apparent E-R 
relationship was observed within each lesion type, but subjects with dominant lesions of the plaque or 
tumour type tended to have larger reductions in mSWAT score vs. subjects with a patch manifestation. 
Dominant lesion type was a variable obtained directly from the source data (i.e. it was not derived in 
any post-hoc fashion).

No apparent relationships between response and neutralising antibody were observed. The change 
from baseline in Cycle 4 vs. the presence or absence of detectable tagraxofusp-levels in Cycle 3 were 
plotted. Subjects with no detectable tagraxofusp still showed a reduction in mSWAT and of similar 
magnitude to subjects with quantifiable tagraxofusp concentrations. 
Secondary pharmacology 
QTc/exposure analysis 
A QTc/exposure analysis was performed using data from Study 0114 to evaluate the relationship 
between tagraxofusp concentrations and duration of the Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF), the 
duration of the RR interval, and whether ADAs alter the relationships between tagraxofusp 
concentration and ECG metrics.  
The E-R analysis dataset comprised data from 96 patients. Patient ages ranged from 21 to 87 years 
and 29% of patients were female. Eight-three percent (83%) were administered doses of 12 μg/kg/day 
and 48% were BPDCN patients. Seventy-seven percent (77%) had a least one neutralising ADA 
positive measurement. Although 96 patients are included in the data set, only 95 had QT interval 
measurements reported.

The fixed effect estimates and bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI) indicate that tagraxofusp is 
not associated with a concentration-dependent prolongation of the QTcF interval (at the highest 
maximum tagraxofusp Study 0114, 353 μg/L, the expected ΔQTcF would be -16.6 ms (353 μg/L × -
0.0469 ms/μg/L). The RR interval duration appears to shorten (heart rate increases) in a 
concentration-dependent manner (Table 29).

Evaluation of the influence of ADA neutralising antibodies on QTcF and RR intervals was performed via 
examination of graphical diagnostics, including weighted residuals and empirical Bayesian estimates of 
patient-specific slope estimates. No trend in either of these diagnostics with respect to either the 
dichotomous present/absent or the continuous percent neutralisation variable. Neutralising anti-
tagraxofusp antibodies (NAbs against hIL3 was not modelled, due to limited number of samples) did 
not show any apparent impact on the relationship between tagraxofusp concentration and any of the 
ECG endpoints. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The association of free tagraxofusp exposure and 1) efficacy in BPDCN, 2) safety in multiple haematologic 
malignancies, and 3) biomarkers in BPDCN was evaluated in a comprehensive model-based population 
analysis (see above). For the exposure-efficacy analyses, only responses from patients with BPDCN were 
used, as that is the subject indication of this application. Thus, the analyses only employ data collected 
in  Study  0114.  The  safety  analyses  pool  data  across  the  three  monotherapy  studies  of  tagraxofusp 
(Studies 0114, 0214, and 0314). Summaries of the efficacy and safety analyses are described separately 
below.  Exploratory  efficacy  and  biomarker  analyses  were  also  conducted  for  blast  percentage  in  BM, 
mSWAT, and peripheral blood neutrophil counts (see above). 
Tagraxofusp ER for Efficacy endpoints 
The objectives of these analyses were to characterize the E-R relationship for the probability that best 
overall response (BOR) was complete response (CR) and the duration of response (DOR) for CR. BOR 
was defined for each subject as the best response over the course of the study, with ordering as follows: 
CR+CRc  >  Cri  >  partial  response  >  stable  disease  >  progressive  disease/relapse.  The  tagraxofusp 
exposure metrics to be evaluated in the analysis included the PopPK model predicted Cmax in the dosing 
interval on C1D1 and AUC0-24 following C1D1 dose. AUC0-24 was evaluated as a continuous measure, 
however for graphical and model diagnostic purposes only, AUC0-24 was divided in three bins (0-25 / 
25-100 / > 100 µg.h/L).  
Associations between clinical response and metrics of exposure (both C1D1 AUC0-24 and Cmax) were 
assessed graphically and summarised qualitatively. Associations between BOR of CR+CRc and AUC0-24 
were  quantified  via  a  multiple-predictor  logistic  regression  model.  In  addition  to  exposure,  candidate 
covariates  evaluated  for  inclusion  in  the  model  were  the  stage  of  therapy  (first  line  vs. 
relapsing/recurring), the baseline extent of skin involvement, the dominant skin lesion type, the presence 
or  absence  of  quantifiable  tagraxofusp  in  Cycle  3,  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  ADA  neutralizing 
antibodies in Cycles 1 and 3. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methodology for 
selection of important covariates was employed. Based on exploratory analysis, increasing incidence of 
BOR of CR+CRc was associated with increasing both AUC0-24 and Cmax. Since Cmax and AUC0-24 is 
highly correlated, AUC0-24 was selected as the exposure metric for modelling. 
On the basis of the multiple-predictor logistic regression model with LASSO covariate selection, C1D1 
AUC0-24 was estimated to increase the odds of a BOR of CR+CRc by approximately 2.9x per 100 µg.h/L. 
However,  this  association  was  not  significant  at  the  level  of  0.05  when  applying  asymptotic  standard 
errors (95% CI include the value 1). 
A Markov multistate (longitudinal) model for clinical response was developed and used as the basis for 
predictive inferences regarding DOR. 4 states were defined: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 69/207 
 
 
  
  
 
•  State 1: All on study assessment that were not CR or CRc. All subjects were classified as belonging 
to State 1 at baseline 
•  State 2: All assessment of CR or CRc 
•  State 3: Assessment with transition to progressive disease 
•  State 4: All censoring events not associated with progressive disease 
The  exposure-response  analysis  for  DOR,  showed  that  higher  C1D1  AUC0-24  was  associated  with  a 
0.549x reduction in the hazard of transitioning from State 2 to State 3, however this effect was estimated 
with  a  highly  variable  precision.  The  model-predicted  mean  DOR  varied  from  278  days  to  590  days 
depending on C1D1 exposure category and whether there was quantifiable tagraxofusp in Cycle 3. 
Tagraxofusp ER for Safety endpoints 
The objectives of the analysis were to characterise the relationship between tagraxofusp exposure and 
treatment-emergent  AEs  of  hypoalbuminemia,  elevations  of  transaminases,  and  CLS  in  patients  with 
hematologic malignancies. The analysis of AEs included 2 approaches with different definitions of AEs. 
One approach used AES captured and coded according to preferred terms. The other approach extracted 
laboratory abnormalities and applied CTCAE criteria for determination of AE and severity. 
For each patient and for each AE, the following summary variables were then derived: 
•  A binary variable indicating at least one occurrence of the given AE over the course of the study for 
the given patients 
•  A categorical variable indicating the worst AE grade over the course of the study 
Laboratory abnormalities associated with samples from C1D1 were graded in a manner consistent with 
CTCAE criteria, as follows: Albumin (Grade 1 : 3-3.5 g/dL; Grade 2: 2-<3 g/dL; Grade 3: < 2 g/dL); ALT 
and AST (Grade 1: 51-150 U/L, Grade 2: 151-250 U/L, Grade 3: 251-1000 U/L, Grade 4: >1000 U/L). 
For each analyte and for each patient, the following summary variables were derived: A binary variable 
indicating  the  presence  of  at  least  one  laboratory  abnormality  during  Cycle  1;  A  categorical  variable 
indicating the worst grade for the over the laboratory abnormality during Cycle 1.  
The tagraxofusp exposure metrics to be evaluated in the analysis included the PopPK model predicted 
Cmax in the dosing interval on C1D1 and AUC0-24 following C1D1 dose. AUC0-24 was evaluated as a 
continuous measure, however for graphical and model diagnostic purposes only, AUC0-24 was divided 
in  three  bins  (0-25  /  25-100  /  >  100  µg.h/L).  Associations  between  incidence  and  AUC0-24  were 
quantified via multiple-predictor logistic regression models. Candidate covariates evaluated for AE and 
laboratory abnormality models were disease status, baseline albumin, ALT and AST, presence or absence 
of quantifiable SL-401 during Cycle 3 or 4, presence or absence of Nab. 
All  the  6  analysed  AEs  exhibited  both  increasing  incidence  and  increasing  severity  in  association  with 
both C1DA AUC0-24 and Cmax.  
On the basis of the multiple-predictor logistic regression model as shown in Table 30, C1D1 AUC0-24 
was estimated to increase significantly the odds of: 
-  Hypoalbuminemia laboratory abnormality by approximately 5.5x per 100 µg.h/L 
-  CLS AE by approximately 1.97x per 100 µg.h/L

Table 30. Estimated effects of C1D1 AUc0-24 for AE and laboratory abnormalities 
Quantifiable tagraxofusp in Cycle 3 was generally associated with increased risk of AEs and laboratory 
abnormalities.  Quantifiable  free  tagraxofusp  in  Cycle  3  was  evaluated  as  a  potential  covariate  as  an 
“indirect”  way  of  possibly  characterizing  something  different  about  patients  with  quantifiable 
concentrations in Cycle 3 versus patients who do not have quantifiable concentrations in Cycle 3. The 
Cycle 3 quantifiable exposure assessment was not intended to suggest that exposures occurring after 
the adverse event are ‘causing’ the adverse event but to indicate there may be other contributing factors 
that are correlated with quantifiable free tagraxofusp in Cycle 3. Presence of neutralizing ADA in Cycle 1 
was  associated  with  decreased  risk  for  analysed  laboratory  abnormalities  except  albumin  and  for 
analysed AEs except CLS, for which the covariate was not found to be predictive.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data are supported by 4 clinical studies in adult patients with haematological 
malignancies, including BPDCN where Study 0114 is the pivotal study.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data of tagraxofusp are predominantly reported descriptively for two reasons: only 
free tagraxofusp was measured resulting in a high variability caused by anti-drug antibodies; due to an 
apparent disconnection of exposure to efficacy data. 
Full PK sampling has been performed at several occasions. No dedicated clinical pharmacology studies 
in healthy subjects or in patients were conducted. No evaluations of tagraxofusp pharmacology in 
human biomaterials were performed.  
Generally, based on the validation reports, the used bioanalytical methods developed for the detection 
and quantification of SL-401 and hIL3 ADA or Nab in human biological matrix comply with acceptance 
criteria. However for the quantification of the free tagraxofusp, the developed bioanalytical method 
suffers from the lack of selectivity. Since the calibration curve (in Beagle plasma), the QCs, and the 
method validation for selectivity (both in selected human low ADA plasma) were run with plasma that 
is not representative of the target population with regards to its ADA titers, this questions the reliability 
of the assay and the derived PK parameters, especially for low tagraxofusp concentrations. The sole 
Assessment report

Page 71/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
exception is the case where the ADA status is negative, where the method can be considered 
adequate. Therefore, the characterization of the tagraxofusp PK is considered adequately performed 
only in 4 or 5 patients depending on the PK parameter measured. Consequently, all the PK and PK/PD 
results could not be considered reliable. 
The applicant was advised to provide a fully validated method of quantification of free tagraxofusp 
(fulfilment of the selectivity requirement) representative of the samples measured, however, the issues 
identified in the application prevent a recommendation to grant a marketing authorisation. Tagraxofusp 
is given as an intravenous infusion therefore no specific study of absorption is requested. Two 
formulations were used during the clinical development (a frozen liquid formulation or a lyophilized 
powder formulation), the patients with BPDCN in stage 4 of the study were treated with the lyophilized 
powder.  
Due to the near ubiquitous immunization against diphtheria, it was expected that most of the patients 
have pre-existing ADA which have a clear impact on tagraxofusp PK. Indeed, only in 5 patients which 
were ADA negative at baseline, estimated distribution volume was 5.1 L suggesting that tagraxofusp is 
not distributed beyond the plasma and extracellular fluids, estimated clearance was 7.16 L/h with a 
short half-life of 0.714h. In patients who were ADA positive at baseline, distribution volume and 
clearance increased by a 4-fold and 1.7-fold respectively.  
Since tagraxofusp is a recombinant protein, it could be considered to be degraded into amino-acids.  
Dose proportionality could not be formally demonstrated and time dependency is expected and 
mediated by the time-dependent production of ADA. Inherent to the analytics of only free tagraxofusp, 
the PK is strongly dependent on ADA titers and thus very variable not only between subjects, but also 
between administration days and cycles. The population PK analysis based on this data reflects this 
variability and followingly has a poor performance and cannot be relied on. The same is true for the 
PK/PD analysis.  
Due to the nature of the compound, a fusion protein, several studies are not required, such as renal 
and hepatic impairment studies, as well as age, gender or race dependence, given that the protein is 
expected to be degraded by proteolysis, which does not depend on organ function nor age.  
Results of the NCA based analysis, even though they should be viewed with caution since the 
developed bioanalysis method for free tagraxofusp suffers from a lack of selectivity, do not contradict 
the assumption that renal and hepatic clearance, age, gender, race and weight have no effect on PK 
parameters.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Numerous toxins have been utilised as targeted toxins mainly linked to antibody or antibody 
fragments. Two very important toxins are Diphtheria toxin (DT) and Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). 
Because these act catalytically they are highly potent, so one molecule gaining entry into the cytosol is 
sufficient to kill the cell. In the case of PE, it has been calculated that fewer than 1000 molecules of 
immunotoxin/cell is sufficient to cause complete tumour regressions (Kreitman and Pastan, 1998). 
The proposed mechanism of action (MoA) of tagraxofusp is specific binding through CD123, 
translocation of the catalytic subunit to arrest protein synthesis, following internalisation of the 
diphtheria toxin. To support the postulated MoA, the applicant has suggested peripheral blood 
neutrophil count and bone marrow blast cells as PD endpoints, in addition to modelling approaches on 
both. However, the proposed MoA of tagraxofusp is not clear cut, especially in light of the heavy load 
of neutralising specific antibodies present. Observed trends in PD end-points (e.g., decrease in bone 
marrow blasts), might indicate a mechanistic explanation of targeted binding on blasts cells prior to 
apoptosis, but due to the total ADA load in 100% of patients, where 96% of patients had neutralising 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 72/207 
 
 
  
  
 
antibodies, an adjuvant mechanism with a general stimulation of the immune system also appears as a 
probable scenario. The applicant has given a comprehensive and thorough discussion on potential 
mechanisms of action through which tagraxofusp may exert its effect on dendritic cancer cells in either 
free or bound form, highlighting the dynamic and multifaceted effect of ADAs and NAbs on the MoA of 
tagraxofusp. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
As outlined above, exposure measurements are deemed unreliable and should therefore not be used 
for any E-R relationship considerations.  
Detectable concentrations of free tagraxcofusp may not entirely represent its therapeutic effect, as 
target-bound tagraxofusp may still be available and biologically active in concentrations sufficient to 
maintain subject responses. Total concentrations of tagraxofusp (free and target bound), which 
according to the applicant, were unavailable, could be more closely related to the PD response. 
According to literature (Feuillard et al., Blood 2002), most patients with BPDCN have skin lesions at 
diagnosis and subsequent or simultaneous involvement of the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and 
lymph nodes. The proposed PD end-point of bone marrow blasts, therefore, may not be optimal to 
reflect responses in all patients with BPDCN. In the 0114 study, the bone marrow is only affected by 
blastic dendritic cells in 50% of patients at baseline. Blast cells may apparently circulate in peripheral 
blood, confusing the picture even further. Bone marrow blast cell levels is not a part of the diagnostic 
tool for identification of BPDCN according to the WHO 2016 reclassification (Blood, 2016). Since bone 
marrow blast frequencies range from 0-94% in patients with BPDCN, and no correlation between bone 
marrow blast levels and clinical response to tagraxofusp were seen, the utility of monitoring BMBC as a 
PD marker of response is considered very low.  
An appropriate ECG monitoring is expected for all compounds, including therapeutic proteins. Due to 
their size, it is unlikely that large fusion proteins like tagraxofusp, with a potential high specificity for 
their target antigens, would directly inhibit ion channels, i.e. hERG, responsible for cardiac 
repolarisation. However, if the drug has primary or secondary effects on cardiac function, it is plausible 
that the agent may alter dynamics of heart repolarisation, leading to QT prolongation. In the current 
analysis of QT, time-matched measurements of tagraxofusp concentration and collection of ECG data 
seem to be adequately performed, even if PK or ECG observations were missing from some patients. 
ECG measurements and modelling analyses indicated that tagraxofusp is not associated with a 
concentration-dependent prolongation of the QTcF interval. However, the observation that a 
considerable number of patients in the safety population is experiencing QT prolongation (see Clinical 
safety), may indicate a correlation between administration of tagraxofusp and cardiac repolarisation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall Tagraxofusp PK is highly impacted by ADA effect (pre-existing or treatment induced), which 
considerably affects tagraxofusp PK characterisation. At this stage, given the lack of selectivity of the 
developed bioanalytical method for the quantification of free tagraxofusp, the PK characterisation of 
tagraxofusp is considered adequately performed only in 4 or 5 ADA negative patients. Consequently, 
the applicant was advised to provide a fully validated method of quantification of free tagraxofusp 
(fulfilment of the selectivity requirement) representative of the samples measured (in particular with 
respect to the expected ADA levels in the target population). The proposed dosing rationale could be 
considered reasonable since efficacy has been observed beyond cycle 1. However, the issues identified 
in the application prevent a recommendation to grant a marketing authorisation. 
The proposed mechanism of action (MoA) of tagraxofusp via a specific binding through CD123 and 
subsequent arrest in protein synthesis is still not fully elucidated, nonetheless the discussion provided 
by the applicant is considered acceptable.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary efficacy data of tagraxofusp in patients with BPDCN are derived from Study STML-401-
0114 which was initiated based on preliminary evidence from Study 50047. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The dose response studies that were performed to support the dose selection for Tagraxofusp are 
Study 50047 and Study STML-401-0114.  
Study 50047 
The first in human clinical study of tagraxofusp was an investigator-sponsored study (Study 50047) in 
which 2 dosing regimens were evaluated. Regimen A consisted of doses every other day for up to 6 
doses and required patients to be hospitalised during the 2-week dosing period. Five dose levels (4, 5, 
7.07, 9.3, and 12.5 μg/kg/day) administered intravenously as a 15-minute infusion were evaluated. 
Dose-limiting toxicity was not reached during the dose escalation due to transient Grade 3 
transaminase elevations which precluded the final 1 or 2 infusions, and patient unwillingness to 
undergo treatment for 2 weeks in the hospital. The schedule was changed to daily administration for 5 
days (Regimen B) to improve drug delivery and patient compliance, as patients were hospitalised for 1 
week rather than 2 weeks. Doses evaluated in the 5-day regimen ranged from 7.07 to 22.1 μg/kg/day. 
The MTD of tagraxofusp when administered as a single cycle consisting of daily × 5 doses was 
determined to be 16.6 μg/kg/day. Dose-limiting toxicities at the highest dose of 22.1 μg/kg/day 
included transient transaminase elevations and manifestations of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) 
(Frankel, 2014). Based on the totality of the data, the 12.5 μg/kg/day was identified as the RP2D 
based on a favourable risk/benefit profile, with a low incidence of adverse reactions and multiple major 
tumour responses after a single cycle of therapy. 
Study STML-401-0114 
Stage 1: Dose Escalation cohort 
The purpose of Study STML-401-0114 was to confirm the previous Phase 1/2 experience with SL-401 
in Study 50047, in which a single cycle of SL-401 was administered to patients with hematologic 
malignancies, including AML, R/R AML, or BPDCN. Study 0114 was intended to generate clinical 
experience with multiple cycles of SL-401 to identify the optimal dose for BPDCN and AML patients, 
and to evaluate the potential clinical benefit of a multi-cycle regimen, with up to 6 cycles initially 
planned. The primary objective of Stage 1 of the study was to determine the MTD, or the MTeD, where 
multiple DLTs were not observed. 
The design of Stage 1 followed a standard 3+3 design to assess ascending doses of SL-401 
administered on a daily × 5 schedule every 21 days. Approximately 9 to 18 patients were planned to 
be treated at doses of 7, 9, 12, or 16 μg/kg/day. (The 16 μg/kg/day dose was evaluated only in 
patients with AML.) The MTD was defined as the highest dose level where less than 2/3 or 2/6 patients 
experienced a DLT. No intrapatient dose escalation was allowed. Tumor response was assessed 
according to sites of disease involvement (including BM, blood, skin, lymph nodes, and visceral 
organs). 
Upon completion of Stage 1 and analysis of the dose escalation results, the MTD was determined to be 
16 μg/kg/day in patients with AML; this dose was not tested in patients with BPDCN, based in the 
observed responses in terms of CR duration as the 12 μg/kg/day dose in this patient population.  
Stage 2: Expansion cohort 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 74/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Stage 2 of Study STML-401-0114 included 2 expansion cohorts at the dose identified in Stage 1: 1 
cohort for 40 to 50 patients with first-line and R/R BPDCN and 1 for 36 patients with AML. An active 
control arm was not included. The purpose of the expansion stage (Stage 2) was to evaluate efficacy 
assessed by ORR, and further characterize the safety profile of multi-cycle therapy with SL-401 at the 
RP2D, 12 μg/kg administered intravenously over 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day 
cycle. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
STML-401-0114 
Methods 
Study 0114 was a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of SL-401 in BPDCN and 
AML  patients  divided  into  4  stages.    Each  study  stage  represents  a  distinct  development  phase,  with 
Stage 1 results supporting the findings from the previous study 50047 and Stage 2 results providing the 
preliminary evidence of efficacy. Combined, Stages 1-2 provided the basis for the design of Stage 3 (the 
pivotal cohort) in patients with first-line BPDCN. At the time of submission Stage 4 was still ongoing, the 
study was concluded in early 2020. 
Study Participants  
The inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients with BPDCN, tagraxofusp dose and treatment schedule are 
the same across Stages 2-4, with the exception that only first-line BPDCN patients are eligible for 
Stage 3 (as of Amendment 9). Patients meeting the following criteria were eligible for enrolment (only 
inclusion criteria relevant to the BPDCN diagnosis are included in the list): 
Inclusion criteria

8.  The patient had known active or suspected central nervous system (CNS) leukaemia. If 
suspected, CNS leukaemia was required to be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or 
examination of cerebrospinal fluid. 
9.  The patient was receiving immunosuppressive therapy, with the exception of low-dose 
prednisone (≤10 mg/day), for treatment or prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). If 
the patient had been on immunosuppressive treatment or prophylaxis for GVHD, the 
treatment(s) must have been discontinued at least 14 days before study treatment and there 
must have been no evidence of ≥Grade 2 GVHD. 
10. The patient had uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled 
infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that 
would have limited compliance with study requirements. 
11. The patient was pregnant or breast feeding. 
12. The patient had known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus or active or chronic 
Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C. 
Treatments 
The populations included in each stage were as follows: 
•  Stage 1: Patients with first-line or R/R BPDCN and AML. 
•  Stage 2: Patients with first-line or R/R BPDCN and AML. 
•  Stage 3 (Pivotal Cohort): Patients with first-line BPDCN only. 
•  Stage 4: Patients with first-line or R/R BPDCN. 
Two pharmaceutical forms of SL-401 have been tested in the Study 0114; SL-401 solution and SL-401 
Lyophilized  Powder.  SL-401  is  a  non-preserved,  sterile,  liquid  dosage  form  intended  for  IV  infusion 
containing  an  aqueous  solution  of  1.0  mg  of  SL-401.  SL-401  Lyophilized  Powder  is  a  non-preserved, 
sterile lyophilized white powder and is supplied in a single-use vial containing 1.0 mg of SL-401. It is 
intended for IV infusion only after reconstitution followed by further dilution with 0.9% Sodium Chloride, 
USP. 
In all study stages, SL-401 was administered as a daily intravenous (IV) infusion over 15 minutes for up 
to 5 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle, initially for up to 6 cycles, with the potential to receive additional 
cycles, with the approval of the Medical Monitor. By Amendment 8 (08 Feb 2016), it was stipulated that 
patients who benefitted from treatment, in the judgment of the Investigator, may have received repeated 
cycles of SL-401; no maximum duration of therapy was set. 
In Stage 1, patients were assigned to a dose cohort according to the dose-escalation scheme. In Stages 
2 to 4, all patients received SL-401 at a dose RP2D identified in Stage 1 (i.e., 12 µg/kg/day). 
Patients received the following premedication approximately 60 minutes before each SL-401 infusion: 
•   Acetaminophen 650 mg (or equivalent dose of paracetamol) orally (PO) 
•   Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent dose of another H1-histamine antagonist) 
•   Methylprednisolone 50 mg IV (or an equivalent dose of another corticosteroid) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 77/207 
 
 
  
  
 
•   Ranitidine 50 mg IV (or an equivalent dosage of another H2-histamine antagonist) 
The  first  cycle  of  SL-401  was  administered  in  the  inpatient  setting,  with  hospitalization  beginning  the 
day  of  the  first  infusion  of  SL-401  (or  a  prior  day)  and  ending  approximately  24  hours  after  the  last 
infusion  of  SL-401.  Subsequent  cycles  of  SL-401  were  administered  in  the  inpatient  setting  or  in  a 
suitable outpatient ambulatory care setting that was equipped for intensive monitoring of patients with 
hematopoietic malignancies undergoing treatment, at the discretion of the Investigator and according to 
institutional  guidelines  and  capabilities.  Patients  were  monitored  for  at  least  4  hours  following  the 
administration of each infusion of SL-401.

Note: All parameters detailed above (including BM, blood, skin [including mSWAT quantification], lymph nodes and

comparison to baseline values (or post-treatment nadir values as stipulated in the above table). 
1In settings in which there was a change in the blast population on BM evaluation by means of flow cytometry or 
other molecular methodology without a similar degree of change in the morphologic blast percentage, the 
morphologic percentage was utilized to determine response/progression. 
2The percentage of clearance or increase in skin disease was calculated using the mSWAT 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  was  originally  planned  to  be  approximately  40  to  50  BPDCN  patients,  including 
approximately 40 previously treatment-naïve patients treated with the SL-401 the tagraxofusp RP2D (12 
μg/kg/day),  with  the  analysis  of  ORR  to  be  used  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  SL-401  in patients  with 
first-line and R/R BPDCN.  
Stage 3 was a separate prospective cohort designed to confirm the efficacy of tagraxofusp in patients 
with first-line BPDCN observed in Stages 1 and 2. The sample size allocated for Stage 3 was intended to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 82/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
satisfy  specific  statistical  criteria.  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  for  Stage  3  would  compare  the  lower 
bound of a 2-sided 95% Clopper-Exact confidence interval (CI) containing the true CR rate to a rate of 
10%. Statistical significance would be determined if the lower bound of this CI fell above 10%. Assuming 
a CR rate of at least 60%, a minimal sample size of 10 first-line BPDCN patients provided at least 90% 
power for the primary efficacy assessment. To be evaluable for efficacy, the BPDCN modified intent-to-
treat (mITT) population required central pathology  review to confirm the diagnosis. As central review 
could  not  be  performed  in  real  time  and  a  delay  in  confirmation  of  diagnosis  may  have  occurred,  a 
maximum of 15 patients were permitted to enroll during the enrolment period from 26 October 2016 to 
17 March 2017 to ensure an adequate number of patients was available for analysis. To avoid possible 
selection bias, all first-line BPDCN patients enrolled in this time period were to be included in the Stage 
3 analysis. 
Randomisation 
Study STML-401-0114 is a nonrandomized study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study STML-401-0114 was an open-label study; no blinding methods were employed. 
Statistical methods 
The cutoff date for analysis of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity data was 31 Jan 2018. 
Analysis populations 
The following patient populations were evaluated and used for presentation and analysis of the data: 
•  Modified  Intent-to-Treat  (mITT)  Population:  All  patients  who  were  eligible  based  on  the 
Screening criteria and who received at least 1 dose of SL-401. For BPDCN patients to be eligible 
for mITT they must also have had a diagnosis of disease based on central pathology review of 
“Confirmed” or “Inconclusive: Likely BPDCN”. Patients were grouped according to the planned 
dose level at time of enrollment. However, as no major protocol violations warranting exclusion 
from analysis were identified by the applicant, a per-protocol population was not defined and no 
analyses for this population were performed. 
• 
Immunogenicity Population: All patients enrolled in the study  who received at least 1  dose of 
SL-401  and  had  a  baseline  sample  taken  with  reportable  result  for  ADA  or  AIA.  The 
immunogenicity population was used for summary of immunogenicity status pre-treatment. The 
Immunogenicity Evaluable Population included all patients enrolled in the study who received at 
least  1  dose  of  SL-401  and  had  a  baseline  sample  and  at  least  1  sample  taken  after  drug 
administration with reportable result for ADA or AIA.  
•  Safety Population, defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least 1 dose of 
SL-401. Patients were grouped according to the actual dose level received (see safety sections 
of the CHMP AR).

The  consistency  of  the  methodology  (disease  diagnosis,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  response 
criteria,  and  schedule  of  assessments)  across  the  conduct  of  the  study  enabled  pooling  by  baseline 
disease state across stages. The pooling of data for efficacy analysis at 12 μg/kg/day is shown in Table 
34.

The  definitions  of  select  key  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  are  summarised  above.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint of Study 0114 was tabulated as the number and percentage of patients who 
achieved CR+CRc. The 95% Clopper-Pearson Exact CIs around the rate of CR+CRc were presented. A 
formal statistical hypothesis test was performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, to test that the rate 
of CR+CRc in first-line patients in Stage 3 exceeds the lower benchmark of 10%.

Recruitment 
Study 0114 was initiated June 2014, and efficacy and safety data collected through January 2018 are 
from patients enrolled in or before 17 March 2017. Nine study centres in the United States (US) were 
included in this study, with patients enrolled at 7 of these 9 centres at the time of the original data cut-
off of 31 January 2018. Patients enrolled in stage 3 started treatment between 16 Nov 2016 and 23 Feb 
2017,  and  the  cut-off  for  analysis  was  31  Jan  2018.  The  study  was  ongoing  as  of  31  Jan  2018  (with 
Stage 4 open for enrolment at the time of the dossier submission). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Protocol Amendment 5 (28 Jul 2014) was the first protocol version under which patients were enrolled. 
There have been 4 amendments to the protocol since Protocol Amendment 5. 
Protocol Amendment 6 (01 Dec 2014) was implemented during the Stage 1 dose-escalation phase 
with the following main changes: 
• 
Provide risk mitigation strategies for the tagraxofusp related serious adverse reaction capillary 
leak syndrome (CLS): 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 89/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
-  modification of the entrance criteria to require that patients have a normal LVEF before 
study entry  
-  more rigorous monitoring of patients during the infusion period in each cycle, including 
daily assessment of body weight.  
- 
clarified that in the setting of early signs/symptoms consistent with CLS, including weight 
gain, hypotension, and/or decreased serum albumin, tagraxofusp treatment was to be 
delayed for a minimum of 1 day until there was evidence of stability of these 
signs/symptoms. 
Protocol Amendment 7 (11 Aug 2015) was implemented with the enrolment of Stage 2 BPDCN 
patients and contained the following main changes: 
• 
Incorporation of additional risk mitigation strategies for CLS including requirement of higher 
minimum serum albumin level for eligibility and cessation of therapy in a setting of significant 
albumin reductions or Grade 3 (or higher) transaminase elevations. Furthermore, in the setting 
of CLS signs or Grade 3 transaminase elevation, fewer than 5 doses of investigational therapy 
could have been administered in a given cycle. 
•  BPDCN diagnosis was to be made or confirmed by the pathology laboratories at the 
investigative sites; subsequent to enrolment, pathology material was to be submitted for 
central pathology review to confirm the BPDCN diagnosis. 
• 
• 
It was clarified that an IRC would assess response for BPDCN patients. 
The timing of and procedures for tumour response assessments in BPDCN patients were 
augmented, as follows: 
-  A more detailed schedule for BM aspirate (± biopsy) subsequently to C2 was specified for 
patients enrolled in Stage 2. 
- 
The quantification of skin disease burden via the mSWAT instrument was required at the 
time of each skin assessment. 
Protocol Amendment 8 (08 Feb 2016). The principal changes made by this amendment affected 
BPDCN patients in Stage 2, as follows: 
•  The entrance criteria were revised such that in addition to patients with R/R BPDCN, patients 
with previously untreated BPDCN would be eligible for enrollment. 
•  Study objectives for BPDCN patients enrolled in Stage 2 were revised to include the following: 
- 
Primary objective: Efficacy as assessed by ORR. 
-  Secondary objective: CR rate (including CRi and CRc). 
-  Secondary objective: Estimation of DOR, PFS, and OS. 
•  Clarifications were made regarding disease measurements and response assessment such that 
it was specifically stated that positive sites of disease identified during Screening were required 
to be followed during the study at every response evaluation.  
-  Sites with no evidence of disease during Screening were to be documented as 
such and an assessment that baseline disease was not present needed to be 
adequately documented in source and recorded in the clinical database; 
thereafter, these sites of disease did not need to be followed, unless there was 
evidence of PD. 
• 
It was clarified that patients would be followed for response and survival until assessment of 
the primary and secondary objectives was complete for all patients. Accordingly, patients in CR

or PR at the time of discontinuation of SL-401 were to continue to have disease assessments 
performed on an every 6-week basis (±1 week) through 6 months post-baseline, and then on 
an every 90-day basis or until, in the judgment of the Investigator, there was evidence of 
relapsed or progressive disease. 
•  The maximum duration of SL-401 therapy of 6 cycles was eliminated, and it was stipulated 
that patients could continue to receive SL-401 as long as they were benefitting from treatment, 
in the Investigator’s opinion. 
Protocol Amendment 9 (08 Feb 2017) implemented the outcome from a meeting with FDA to 
discuss an interim analysis of efficacy data from 32 BPDCN patients enrolled in Stages 1 and 2 
between 06 Oct 2014, and 29 Aug 2016: 
•  Stage 2 of the study was closed.  
•  Stage 3 of the study was added. Any patient with first-line BPDCN enrolled on or after 26 Oct 
2016, was included in Stage 3 until a sufficient number of patients were enrolled to ensure 10 
patients were included in the mITT analysis population. The primary endpoint for this cohort 
was the CR rate. 
•  Stage 4 of the study was added, into which any patients with R/R BPDCN enrolled on or after 
26 Oct 2016, were to be allocated. Furthermore, after the maximum number of planned first-
line BPDCN patients were enrolled in Stage 3, any additional first-line BPDCN patients were to 
be enrolled in Stage 4. It was planned that BPDCN patients enrolled in Stage 4 subsequent to 
completion of enrollment in Stage 3 may have received a lyophilized formulation of tagraxofusp 
for injection. 
•  Based on these changes, the total study sample size was increased to up to 120 patients 
(including ~70 BPDCN patients)

Numbers analysed 
mITT 
The mITT population was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy parameters. This population 
was defined as all patients who were eligible, based on the entrance criteria, and received at least 1 dose 
of SL-401 liquid solution. For BPDCN patients to be eligible for mITT, they must also have had confirmed 
diagnosis  of  disease,  based  on  central  pathology  review.  Patients  with  “inconclusive:  likely  BPDCN” 
disease, based on central pathology review, also were included. All 47 BPDCN patients, including 32 with 
first-line BPDCN, of whom 29 received SL-401 at 12 μg/kg/day, and 15 with R/R BPDCN, of whom all 
received SL-401 at 12 μg/kg/day, were included.  
ADA Analysis 
90% (28/31) and 93% (13/14) of the 1L and R/R BPDCN patients, respectively, were ADA-positive at 
baseline. Among them, results showed that; i) 21% (6/28) and 23% (3/13) of the 1L and R/R BPDCN 
patients, respectively, presented neutralising antibodies (NAb-positive) at baseline, ii) 96% and 85% of 
the  1L  and  R/R  BPDCN  patients,  respectively,  presented  boosted  ADA  after  being  administered 
tagraxofusp, and iii) the maximum fold increased titer for treatment boosted-ADA for 1L BPDCN patients 
was of 100,000 and was reached at C2D15, C2D21 and C4D21; for R/R BPDCN patients was of 1.000.000 
and was reached at C2D21. 
Among the evaluable ADA-negative BPDCN patients at baseline (9% - 3/31 and 7% - 1/13, 1L and R/R, 
respectively), results showed; i) 100% of the 1L and R/R BPDCN patients presented boosted ADA after 
Assessment report

tagraxofusp, and ii) the peak positive titer was reached at C2D15 for the all the BPDCN population (for 
more details see discussion on clinical safety). 
AIA Analysis 
Almost  all  of  the  patients  were  AIA-negative  at  baseline;  only  1  patient  (7%)  from  the  R/R  BPDCN 
population was AIA-positive. Results showed similar results for both 1L and R/R BPDCN population with 
incidence of treatment-induced AIA between 90 – 92% and a maximum fold increased titer of 51200 
that was reached at C3D15. At the same incidence of total AIA-positive after treatment (94% vs 93%), 
Results of total AIA Nab-positive incidence was higher for 1L patients (96%) compared to R/R patients 
(77%) (for more details see discussion on clinical safety).

Patients Treated with SL-401 at 12 μg/kg/day (mITT Population) 
Time to BMCR was assessed as an exploratory endpoint, with results showing a median time to BMCR of 
25 days (first and third quartile range 22.0, 39.0). 
Objective Response Rate 
A  summary  of  the  ORR  in  first-line  BPDCN  patients,  including  the  KM  analysis  of  duration  of  OR,  is 
presented in Table 46.

Of the 26 first-line BPDCN patients with an OR, the duration of OR was >6 months (range 201 to 981+ 
days  [32.2+  months])  for  15  patients  and  >12  months  (i.e.,  360  days)  (range  372+  to  981+  days 
[32.2+ months]) for 8 patients as of 31 Jan 2018; the median duration of OR was not reached (range 
0.7 to 32.2+ months). 
Bridge to Stem Cell Transplantation 
A total of 13 (45%; CI 26.4, 64.3%) of 29 first-line BPDCN patients in stage 1 to 3 treated with SL-401 
at  12  μg/kg/day  were  successfully  bridged  to  SCT.  Of  the  13  patients  bridged  to  SCT,  3  underwent 
autologous SCT and 10 underwent allogeneic SCT (1 of whom received haploidentical stem cells donated 
by his child). The median time from the first SL-401 dose to SCT was 135 days (range 76 to 203 days). 
The interval between the last SL-401 dose and SCT ranged from 22 to 65 days (median 37 days). 
A total of 77% (10/13) of patients who were bridged to SCT were alive with ongoing response as of 31 
Jan 2018. Among the 10 patients who underwent SCT and who were alive with ongoing DOR, response 
durations ranged from 241+ to 981+ days, with the DOR >6 months for all 10 patients; >12 months for 
6 patients; and >2 years for 3 patients. Of these 10 patients, 6 were aged <65 years and 4 were aged 
≥65 years. Three of 13 patients who underwent SCT, all aged >65 years, had died as of 31 Jan 2018. 
Among the 13 patients who achieved an OR but who did not undergo SCT, 6 (46.2%) were alive at the 
time of the 31 Jan 2018 data cut-off, with survival ranging from 11 to 30 months, including 2 patients 
with  long-standing  and  ongoing  response  durations  (17  and  30  months,  respectively),  and  4  patients 
who had progressed with DOR ranging from <1 month to 7 months). Seven of these 13 patients had 
died between 5 and 18 months after the start of SL-401.

As of 31 Jan 2018, median RFS was 11.2 months (range 1.3 to 32.2+ months) among the 21 first-line 
BPDCN patients treated with SL-401 at 12 μg/kg/day who achieved a best response of CR (N=14) or 
CRc (N=7). By 31 Jan 2018, 10 (48%) patients who had achieved a best response of CR or CRc had died 
or experienced PD.

Time to CR was assessed as an exploratory endpoint, with results showing a median time to CR of 64 
days (first and third quartile range 46.0, 82.0). 
An  exploratory  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  on  the  rate  of  CR+CRc  plus  CRi.  In  this  sensitivity 
analysis, the CR rate was 33% (5/15) among all R/R BPDCN patients. 
Bone Marrow Complete Response 
A  summary  of  the  BMCR  rate  in  R/R  BPDCN  patients  treated  with  SL-401  at  12  μg/kg/day  with  BM

Progression-free Survival 
Among all 15 R/R BPDCN patients, median PFS was 2.6 months (range 0.5 to 15.7 months) as of 31 Jan 
2018; by this time, 14 (93%) of 15 patients had died or experienced PD. 
Relapse-free Survival 
median RFS was 8.9 months (range 3.7 to 14.2 months) among the 2 R/R BPDCN patients treated with 
SL-401  at  12  μg/kg/day  who  achieved  a  best  response  of  CR.  By  that  time,  both  patients  who  had 
achieved CR had died (1 patient) or experienced PD (1 patient).  
Ancillary analyses 
Due to the small number of patients, subgroup analyses were neither planned nor performed for 
efficacy endpoints.

Additional data from stage 4 
Efficacy data from Stage 4 (N=44) of Study 0114 have been provided during the procedure. In this Stage 
4,  37  first-line  BPDCN  patients  and  5  R/R  BPDCN  patients  received  the  lyophilised  formulation  of 
tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day, which represents the largest cohort of the study 0114. Among the 37 first-
line BPDCN patients, CR rate was 44.4% (16/36) (95% CI: 27.9, 61.9) and ORR was 63.9% (23/36) 
(95% CI: 46.2, 79.2). Median durations of CR and ORR were both 3.9 months (95% CI: 0.72, 23.33). 
Median PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8) and median OS was 9.8 months (95% CI: 6.6, 18.2). 
The number of patients bridged to HSCT was 22%. 
Efficacy results are summarised as follows.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In Study 0114, a total of 29 patients with first-line BPDCN were treated with the proposed to be marketed 
dose of 12 μg/kg/day of tagraxofusp across 3 stages (Stages 1-2: N=16 and Stage 3: N=13) (Table 56).  
For this analysis, data from 28 of the 29 patients who had at least one post-baseline response assessment 
were included; one patient in Stage 3 who did not have any post-baseline assessments was excluded. 
Patients enrolled in Stage 3 generally presented with higher disease burden in the skin and bone marrow, 
the 2 predominant sites of disease in patients with BPDCN.  
Table  58  presents  baseline  disease  burden  in  skin  and  BM  by  stage.  Given  the  apparent  numerical 
difference  between  Stages  1-2  compared  to  Stage  3  in  the  rates  of  CR/CRc  potentially  related  to  the 
stability  of  the  results,  a  Bayesian  approach  was  used  to  estimate  the  probability  distribution  of  the 
CR/CRc rate. The assumption of a beta prior distribution results in a 95% credible interval on the CR/CRc 
rate  parameter  of  (66.1%,  98.2%).  Subsequently,  a  95%  percent  credible  interval  on  the  posterior 
distribution of the CR/CRc rate parameter using the prior distribution from Stages 1-2 updated by the 
likelihood of the Stage 3 data was calculated as (53.7%, 86.2%), which is a more reliable estimate of 
the true CR/CRc rate since it appropriately adjusts for all data.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No  clinical  studies  in  special  population  were  conducted.  Three  paediatric  patients  have  been  treated 
under investigator-sponsored single-patient INDs, including a 10-year-old female with R/R BPDCN, a 12-
year-old female with R/R BPDCN, and a 15-year-old female with previously-treated BPDCN.  All 3 patients 
received tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg administered intravenously over 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 
every 2 to 3 weeks. Skin disease and BM disease were present in 2 patients each. Two of the 3 paediatric 
patients experienced response to treatment; however, the responses were of short duration.

BPDCN.  The  results  have  been  published  (Frankel,  2013;  Frankel,  2014).  Patients  were  either 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) or first-line but deemed not to be candidates for standard chemotherapy. A 
single cycle of tagraxofusp was administered intravenously at 12 μg/kg over 15 minutes once daily on 
days  1  to  5  of  a  21-day  cycle.    BPDCN  response  criteria  were  based  on  published  recommendations 
(Cheson, 2003; Cheson, 2007; Pagano, 2016) and are outlined in Table 60.

Source: (Frankel, 2014). 
Six patients had disease limited to the skin, and 5 had BM disease with or without skin, nodal, or splenic 
involvement.  The  treatment  regimen  for  all  patients  included  a  single  cycle  of  therapy;  7  patients 
received  all  5  doses,  2  patients  received  a  single  dose,  and  1  patient  each  had  2  or  3  doses.  Three 
patients  received  a  second  course  after  disease  relapse.  Nine  BPDCN  patients  were  evaluable  for 
response, i.e., had at least one response assessment, including 4 first-line patients and 5 R/R patients. 
The  objective  response  rate  (ORR)  was  78%  (7/9),  with  5  complete  responses  (CRs)  and  2  partial 
responses (PRs): 
•  Among the 4 first-line patients, the ORR was 100% (4/4), including 2 CRs. 
•  Among the 5 R/R patients, the ORR was 60% (3/5), comprised of 3 CRs. 
The median response duration across the 11 patients was 5 months, with a range of 1 to 20+ months, 
including 4 patients with ongoing remissions at the time of the analysis: 
•  One  first-line  patient  who  achieved  a  CR  was  alive  and  in  remission  at  33  months  (remission 
ongoing at the time of the update). 
• 
Three R/R patients who achieved a CR survived >12 months in remission, including 1 patient 
who survived 30 months in remission. 
Notably, normalization of blood counts was observed, often within 4 weeks, without an interim period of 
myelosuppression.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Assessment of clinical efficacy of tagraxofusp in patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell 
neoplasm (BPDCN) is mainly based on the results from the Phase I/II study STML-401-0114 (Study 
0114). 
In all study stages, the recommended dose of tagraxofusp is 12 µg/kg administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 15 minutes, once daily, on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day cycle. Two different pharmaceutical 
forms (solution vs powder) were administered to the full study population.  
Tagraxofusp was administered initially for up to 6 cycles with the potential to receive additional cycles. 
By amendment 8 (08 Feb 2016), the patients may continue to receive tagraxofusp if they benefitted 
from treatment according to the investigators with no maximum duration of therapy.  
The first cycle of tagraxofusp was administered in the in-patient setting and patients were monitored 
until at least 24 hours after the last infusion. For subsequent treatment cycles, tagraxofusp could be 
administered in the in-patient setting or in a suitable out-patient ambulatory care setting that was 
equipped for intensive monitoring of patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing treatment, 
at the discretion of the Investigator and according to institutional guidelines and capabilities; patients 
were monitored for at least 4 hours following the administration of each infusion of tagraxofusp. 
Patients were pre-medicated with a H1-histamine antagonist (e.g. diphenhydramine hydrochloride), a 
H2-histamine antagonist (e.g. ranitidine), a corticosteroid (e.g. 50 mg intravenous methylprednisolone 
or equivalent) and paracetamol approximately 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion. 
In addition, preliminary efficacy data had been obtained from an Investigator-sponsored first in human 
study (Study 50047) which the aim was to select the intended dose and schedule of administration for 
a larger Phase 2 clinical trial. Nevertheless, it was conducted without entering data into a formal 
database and limited resolution of data queries was possible. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
At the time of scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/2015/SME/III), a placebo with the option of cross-
over at progression or investigator’s choice of therapy in the control arm were proposed as 
comparators, but the sponsor did not include it in the study design. A nonrandomised, open-label and 
single-arm design was chosen for the Study 0114. According to the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/2015/SME/III), a single uncontrolled pivotal study might be considered 
acceptable to support a MAA, if it provides; i) an acceptable design, ii) robust and convincing results 
that are externally valid, and iii) sufficient safety information to allow estimation of the benefit/risk. 
However, many uncertainties would remain about the robustness of evidence that can be produced in 
single
arm trials, and further, in a small sample size.  
‐
Scientific advice from the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/FU/1/2017/SME/II) was sought on the design 
and analysis plan of the Stage 3 pivotal efficacy cohort. The CHMP position was that in the context of 
such a rare disease, analysis of the totality of data (pooled Stages 1-4) would be preferable for the 
benefit-risk assessment. Thus, in addition to presenting the efficacy analysis of Stage 3, an analysis 
where first-line patients were pooled from stages 1-3 is also included.   
The inclusion/exclusion criteria were generally agreed by the CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/2015/SME/III) and were the same across Stages 2-4, with the exception that 
only first-line BPDCN patients were eligible for Stage 3. This facilitates pooling for efficacy analysis. 
Importantly, the diagnosis criteria for BPDCN was according to the WHO classification and in addition 
to local pathologic assessment, pathology material was also submitted for central pathology review to 
Assessment report

confirm the diagnosis. CNS leukaemia was listed as an exclusion criterion in this study. This can be 
understood from a classic oncology study design where this patient group is normally excluded from 
the study population. However, a recent study reports CNS involvement in ~60% of the BPDCN cases 
despite lack of neurological symptoms. Information in the SmPC alert about the fact that patients with 
CNS leukaemia were not included in the study, that the passage of tagraxofusp through the blood 
brain barrier is unknown and that other treatment alternatives should be considered if CNS disease is 
present.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the pivotal cohort (Stage 3) was to determine the CR rate (ie, CR + 
complete response with minimal residual skin abnormality [CRc]) in patients with first-line BPDCN. 
Considering that there are no established global response criteria for BPDCN, the applicant had 
proposed an initial definition of CR including CR + CRc + complete response with incomplete blood 
count recovery (CRi). To validate and analyse the clinical benefit of these response criteria, patients 
from Stage 1 and Stage 2 were used to measured DOR of CR, CRc and CRi and assess the likelihood 
that these durations are derived from the same probability distribution. From this analysis, CR and CRi 
did not demonstrate comparability in terms of duration of the response whereas comparability between 
CR and CRc was observed. Then, the definition of CR was amended into the actual definition (CR= CR 
+ CRc). 
Due to the complexity of the BPDCN disease that involves different organs, different response criteria 
used to assess the specific organ involvement in similar disease were combined. Measurements of skin 
disease burden were calculated using the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) which 
is a method for skin scoring that has been used in clinical trials for other malignancies. This approach 
was considered as acceptable by the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/2015/SME/III). 
In the context of a single
arm trial in which the magnitude of response rate is unknown to be predictive 
of long
term clinical benefit, an effect of clinical relevance may be considered when the outcome of CR 
rate is supported by duration of response (DoR) and SCT rate. Other secondary endpoints were also 
‐

included: achievement of BMCR, PFS and OS. These endpoints were endorsed by SAWP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3101/1/FU/1/2017/SME/II). 
Except for the primary endpoint in Stage 3, the applicant has not specifically defined endpoints in the 
different subgroups including the R/R population. Moreover, no secondary endpoints have been 
explicitly described for these subgroups, except for the Stage 3 cohort. Generally, use of endpoints in 
the study could have been better defined. 
Of note, the study 0114 was not sized to detect a particular magnitude of an effect for R/R BPDCN 
population. No multiplicity adjustments were pre-specified and none of the two primary endpoints was 
pre-defined for formal statistical testing. The overall statistical analysis was accepted by the CHMP as 
part of a scientific advice. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose response studies 
The first in human clinical study of tagraxofusp was an investigator-sponsored study (Study 50047) in 
which 2 dosing regimens were evaluated; regimen A (doses every other day for up to 6 doses, 2 weeks 
of inpatient setting) vs regimen B (a daily × 5 schedule every 21 days, 1 week of inpatient setting). 
The selected schedule was the regimen B to improve drug delivery and patient compliance, as patients 
were hospitalised for 1 week rather than 2 weeks. Dose-limiting toxicities at the highest dose of 
22.1 μg/kg/day were observed. Based on the totality of the data, the 12.5 μg/kg/day was identified as 
Assessment report

the RP2D based on a favourable risk/benefit profile, with a low incidence of adverse reactions and 
multiple major tumour responses after a single cycle of therapy. 
The purpose of Study 0114 was to confirm the previous Phase 1/2 experience with tagraxofusp in 
Study 50047). Upon completion of Stage 1 and analysis of the dose escalation results, the MTD was 
determined to be 16 μg/kg/day in patients with AML; this dose was not tested in patients with BPDCN, 
as responses were observed at the 12 μg/kg/day dose in this patient population. For BPDCN patients, 
the RP2D, 12 μg/kg administered intravenously over 15 minutes once daily on days 1 to 5 of a 21-day 
cycle. 
In the study 0114, 3 first-line BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 7 µg/kg/day, 29 first-line 
BPDCN patients (including 13 patients from stage 3) received tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day, and 15 R/R 
BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day. At DCO, only 2 (4.3%) BPDCN patients were 
still ongoing at study 0114. 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the first-line and R/R BPDCN populations, and 
are in line with published descriptions concerning age, sex and disease characteristics excluding the 
race distribution for this disease population. Worldwide population is not fully represented as only USA 
sites were selected. However, taking into account that almost all the enrolled population were white 
(93.1%) and that baseline characteristics were closely matched to the published literature concerning 
BPDCN, it can be expected that the study population will very likely reflect the disease population in 
EU. Based on this, extrapolation of the existing data to the EU population covered by the claimed 
therapeutic indication is considered acceptable. 
In relation to the baseline characteristics of the BPDCN population, the main disease location was skin 
(96.9% first-line and 86.7% R/R), bone marrow (46.9% first-line and 60.0% R/R) and lymph nodes 
(40.6% first-line and 53.3% R/R). Patients presented peripheral blood and visceral disease, as well; 
first-line patients presented a higher incidence of peripheral blood disease (21.9% first-line and 6.7% 
R/R) whereas R/R presented a higher incidence of visceral disease (12.5% first-line and 26.7% R/R).  
Among the 31 first-line BPDCN patients who had skin disease at baseline: the skin was the only 
disease manifestation at time of diagnosis for 16 patients (50.0%) whereas skin and other 
organs/systems were involved for 15 patients (46.9%). Ten patients (31.3%) had no extramedullary 
involvement. 
Twelve (80%) of the 15 R/R BPCN patients were refractory to their most recent line of systemic 
chemotherapy/immunotherapy. The number of prior lines of therapy was 1 for 8 (53%) patients, 2 or 
3 for 4 (27%) patients each, and ≥4 for 2 (13%) patients. In general, the included population is 
considered highly heterogeneous. 
Efficacy 
First-line BPDCN  
•  Stage 3 (N=13) 
The CR rate (CR +CRc) in the confirmatory Stage 3 cohort was 53.8% (7/13) bounded within a 95% CI 
of 25.1 to 80.8, which exceeded the pre-specified rate. Therefore, the study is considered positive as 
the primary endpoint was met. Median duration of the CR was not reached through a median duration 
follow-up of 20.0 months. 
Positive results were also seen in further secondary endpoints; among the 7 first-line BPDCN patients 
with BM disease at baseline, BMCR rate was 85.7% (6/7) (95% CI: 42.1% - 99.6%) and the median 
duration of the BMCR was not reached. 
Assessment report

However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of patients analysed. 
•  All patients with first-line BPDCN (N=29) 
Among all 29 first-line BPDCN patients treated with tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg/day, CR rate was 72.4% 
(21/29) (95% CI: 52.8, 87.3), ORR was 89.7% (26/29), with CR, CRc, CRi, and PR rates of 48.3% 
(14/29), 24.1% (7/29), 0%, and 17.2% (5/29), respectively. Median durations of CR and objective 
response (OR) were not reached through 3 October 2018, with a median duration of follow-up of 24.9 
months (95% CI: 20.0, 30.6) in the updated time-to event analyses. Overall, 44.8% (13/29) patients 
were bridged to SCT with 10 patients of 13 (77%) alive and still in response as compared to those who 
did not undergo SCT where 2 of 16 patients (12.5%%; two in ongoing response after 24 and 43 cycles 
of treatment) were alive at the time of last data cut off. However, in the context of a single arm trial, it 
cannot be excluded that investigator’s choice to proceed to HSCT was partly influenced by the 
knowledge of the type of treatment. Median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI: 4.3- NE) and median OS 
was 18.0 months (95% CI: 9.7- NE). Among the 14 first-line BPDCN patients with BM disease at 
baseline, BMCR rate was 92.9% (13/14) (95% CI: 66.1% - 99.8%) and the median duration of the 
BMCR was not reached (see also below further discussion on the data). 
It should be emphasised that retrospective studies suggested that induction therapy with regimens 
commonly used in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, AML and ALL yield high response rates (CR of 40-90%). 
However, these responses are short-lived with reported median OS ranging from 8 to 12 months 
except for patients who could benefit from allo-HSCT. 
It cannot be excluded that some of the older patients that received tagraxofusp in study 0114 (median 
age was 67.5 years) might not have been healthy enough for chemotherapy as older patients with 
comorbidities generally do not tolerate this regimen very well. Thus, whether tagraxofusp treatment is 
superior to existing chemotherapy alternatives cannot be concluded from these response outcomes but 
it might be a more acceptable alternative for these patients.  
The literature is rather limited concerning bridging to SCT, with few BPDCN patients in each report, and 
the majority of the cases reported in the literature concern younger patients with median age <60 
years. In study 0114 elderly patients (54% were ≥65 years old [range: 22 to 72 years]) have 
successfully been bridged to SCT, and whether this pertains to willingness in this study to bridge 
elderly patients, a higher number of elderly patients achieving CR, or a more healthy study population 
than what is met in clinical practise is not known. 
The majority of patients developed high level of NAbs that had an impact on the free tagraxofusp 
exposure but no effect is likely to be expected on efficacy. The hypothesis that pharmacological effect 
persists despite binding is acceptable and the efficacy beyond the first cycle may seem to be supported 
by clinical data provided. 
However, in the context of a single arm clinical trial with rather small population where 
contextualisation with available historical data is not feasible, the clinical relevance of the effect 
observed in first-line BPDCN patients remains uncertain. Positive results on OS were obtained, but the 
effect on OS presented in CSR seemed to be driven by the SCT itself more than the effect of 
tagraxofusp; median OS results presented for patients that did not undergo a transplantation were 
similar to outcomes obtained with regular chemotherapy.  
R/R BPDCN (N=15) 
Among all 13 R/R BPDCN patients treated with tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg/day, CR rate was 13.3% 
(2/15) (95% CI: 1.7% - 40.5%) and ORR was 66.7% (10/15 – 95% CI: 38.4% - 88.2%). Median 
duration of CR was not reached through 17.3 months of median duration follow-up. Duration of median 
objective response (OR) was 1.6 months (95% IC: 0.7 - 13.9 months). Only one patient was bridged 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 118/207 
 
 
  
  
 
to SCT. Median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 0.6- 3.6) and median OS was 7.1 months (95% CI: 4.1- 
11.9). Among the 9 R/R BPDCN patients with BM disease at baseline, BMCR rate was 66.7% (6/9) 
(95% CI: 29.9% - 92.5%) and the median duration of the BMCR was 2.4 months.  
Study 0114 was not designed to provide any conclusion on this population; no hypothesis, objectives 
or endpoints were planned for R/R BPDCN patients. Based on the exploratory results obtained for R/R 
BPDCN patients, the clinical benefit of the treatment with tagraxofusp in these patients is uncertain. 
Drawing any positive conclusion on the use of tagraxofusp in this population is thus hampered.  
Efficacy supportive studies 
In Study 50047, 11 patients with BPDCN have received tagraxofusp. Only 9 patients were evaluable; 4 
first-line and 5 R/R BPDCN patients. In first-line BPDCN patients, CR rate was 50% (2/4) and ORR was 
100% (4/4). Among R/R BPDCN patients CR rate and ORR were 60% (3/5). 
Additional data from stage 4 
New efficacy data from Stage 4 (N=44) of Study 0114 have been provided during the procedure. In 
this Stage 4, 37 first-line BPDCN patients and 5 R/R BPDCN patients received the lyophilised 
formulation of tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day, which represents the largest cohort of the study 0114. 
Among the 37 first-line BPDCN patients, CR rate was 44.4% (16/36) (95% CI: 27.9, 61.9) and ORR 
was 63.9% (23/36) (95% CI: 46.2, 79.2). Median durations of CR and ORR were both 3.9 months 
(95% CI: 0.72, 23.33). Median PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8) and median OS was 9.8 
months (95% CI: 6.6, 18.2). Only 4 R/R patients have been treated with lyophilized tagraxofusp in 
stage 4, which adds very limited new information about tagraxofusp response in this population. These 
data could only be consider supportive as both pharmaceutical forms are not comparable from a PK 
point of view. Further, supportive efficacy data from stage 4 did not bring reassurance as a lower 
efficacy profile in the target population was shown. 
In summary, results showed heterogeneous response rate and overall survival in the different cohorts. 
Additional expert consultation  
The SAG oncology was consulted in relation to the following questions on the efficacy and safety of 
tagraxofusp: 
1.  Is the response rate and other outcomes seen in study STML 401 0114 indicative that 
treatment with tagraxofusp would provide clinically relevant efficacy in first-line or 
R/R BPDCN?  
This question was debated at length, especially whether activity and benefits have been established, 
whether the level of efficacy can be considered relevant or not given the therapeutic context, and in 
which population the effect has been established. 
Currently, patients with BPDC are treated when possible with intensive induction chemotherapy and 
allogeneic SCT, which is associated with long-term disease control and prolonged survival. Using this 
strategy, median survival has been improved from 8 months to 49 months. From pooled retrospective 
data on >140 patients, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is applicable in 42-44% of patients.  
The same regimens are used for BPDCN as often used for adult patients with an ALL (or AML), and it is 
generally assumed that responses may be similar, or with a slight advantage for ALL-like regimens,  
but long-term outcomes are worse if patients do not undergo allogeneic transplant.  
All SAG members agreed that antitumour activity of tagraxofusp has been shown in several patients, 
on the basis of 56.9% (95% C.I.: 44.0%, 69.2%) of patients meeting the criteria for CR/CRc. A 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 119/207 
 
 
  
  
 
complete response was defined as the disappearance of disease in each site of initial disease. CRc was 
defined as complete response in all disease compartments with residual skin abnormality not indicative 
of active disease. 
All members also agreed that some patients experienced durable responses and underwent allogeneic 
SCT, which is known to be associated with long-term benefits when associated with induction 
chemotherapy. If the ability to undergo allogeneic SCT was confirmed in patients with progressive 
disease for whom allogeneic SCT was not an option at the time of inclusion in the tagraxofusp trial, 
clinical relevant efficacy could be considered established.  
However, the experts questioned whether the studied population clearly met the criteria of patients 
with progressive disease for whom allogeneic SCT was not an option. In general, the population was 
heterogenous with a proportion of relatively young and good performance status (0 or 1) patients so 
that it was not clear why intensive chemotherapy with allogeneic SCT would not have been an option. 
In fact, approximately 30% (10/29) of previously untreated patients went on to allo-SCT after 
tagraxofusp. It was also noted that a few patients proceeded to allogeneic SCT within only 4 to 12 
weeks, which would be unexpected if this had not been an option when starting tagraxofusp.  
The experts were also uncertain about how the level of efficacy would compare to established and 
available induction chemotherapies to be possibly followed by allogeneic SCT, in a population of 
patients eligible for allogeneic SCT. In  particular, the SAG members could not exclude a potential 
detrimental effect in long-term outcomes compared to well-established and widely available induction 
chemotherapy regimens, due to the heterogeneous response rate and overall survival in the different 
cohorts, the short median follow-up, the small sample size, the variable prior treatments, the unknown 
phenotypes (i.e., if CD123 expression was present in 100% of cases) at study entry, the lack of 
reliable long-term data, the limited activity in relapsed patients, the sometimes very short duration of 
response and PFS, and generally an insufficient description of the disease and treatment characteristics 
of patients at entry (e.g., with respect to eligibility for allogeneic SCT), and at the time of SCT. Given 
that induction chemotherapy plus allogeneic SCT is a treatment option that is associated with long-
term survival in approximately 50% of the patients, the risk of a detriment was considered a critical 
issue.  
In conclusion, the SAG agreed that if Elzonris could be demonstrated to enable treatment with 
allogeneic SCT in patients for whom this treatment was not an option, due for instance to insufficient 
response to a chemotherapy-based induction regimen, then clinically relevant efficacy would be 
demonstrated. However, the experts were uncertain whether the current data and analyses presented 
have demonstrated this to be the case. The SAG also agreed that there were too many uncertainties to 
assess the efficacy of Elzonris in a transplant-eligible population, given the lack of long-term data in 
the submission. 
Thus, the experts could not confirm that clinically relevant efficacy has been established. The SAG 
suggested that perhaps further analyses and updates of the data might alleviate some of the existing 
uncertainties. For example, a thorough clinical review of all patients treated, with detailed clinico-
pathologic and therapeutic information for each individual patient, could help establishing which 
patients were clearly not eligible for allogeneic SCT, based on stringent criteria (e.g., lack of response 
to previous treatments), and then assess the role of Elzonris in enabling patients to become eligible. 
This would also be helpful in assessing the role of allogeneic SCT and other subsequent treatments on 
the overall clinical outcome. Also, with all the known caveats, exploratory landmark analyses of 
survival should be conducted to compare patients with or without CR, and patients who did or did not 
undergo allogeneic SCT. The survival of different cohorts, the survival by prior treatment, and the 
survival of patients with or without allogeneic SCT should also be explored based on updated survival 
data.  Lastly, available post-marketing efficacy and safety data from where the product has been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 120/207 
 
 
  
  
 
approved (e.g., U.S.A.) should be presented, also to understand in which patients the product is used 
in clinical practice. 
One expert stressed the fact that although it is unclear to what extent the data support this, assuming 
that the effect after transplant is similar as for intensive chemotherapy, this could likely be a useful 
alternative option in first-line treatment in patients not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and for 
whom the different toxicity profile could be of interest. However, due to the many uncertainties this 
treatment should not be indicated in younger patients, and in any case, confirmatory long-term data 
should be requested in a bigger cohort of patients. 
2.  Is the safety profile of tagraxofusp in the target population acceptable? 
The toxicity profile of tagraxofusp is in principle acceptable given that haematologists are used to 
managing high incidences of haematological and non-haematological toxicity. However, the toxicity 
profile is significant, in particular, the capillary leak syndrome which was sometimes fatal.  
Potential adverse events due to neutralizing antibodies remain a theoretical possibility although the 
SAG agreed that these were not a big concern. 
3.  In what ways might tagraxofusp provide an advantage compared to currently used 
therapies?  
Theoretical advantages in patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT have been 
claimed, but the data and analyses presented were unable to firmly substantiate such advantages. An 
additional therapeutic option would in principle be very welcome but should not put patients at risk of 
detriment in long term outcomes given widely available and well-established chemotherapy regimens. 
Therefore, the additional analyses mentioned under answers to questions 1 and 4 are strongly 
recommended. 
4.  What further investigations are possible to characterise the efficacy and safety of 
tagraxofusp? 
Further investigations should be guided by the target indication. 
For a transplant-eligible population, the objective should be to minimise potential loss of efficacy and if 
possible to improve safety. A randomised design against intensive chemotherapy or “investigator 
choice”, even if not powered to detect small differences in survival, and with stringent criteria for 
eligibility for SCT could help addressing some of the uncertainties. 
For a transplant ineligible population, see above as to additional data and analyses that could help 
addressing some of the uncertainties. Additional data should be collected in this population in a real-
world registry, including baseline patient and disease characteristics, and the whole history of the 
disease, including different interventions and outcomes. Data should also be collected to explore 
mechanisms of resistance (e.g., loss of target expression and auto-antibodies). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy results obtained for first line BPDCN population, including patients from all stages, showed an 
acceptable rate of complete responses (72.4%, median duration not reached) with patients that achieved 
bone-marrow  complete  response.  In  addition,  there  was  important  percentage  of  patients  bridged  to 
SCT, which represents the best chance to obtain long-term remission and long-term survival. However, 
contextualisation of the results was not possible.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 121/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Positive results on OS were obtained, as well, but the effect on OS presented in CSR seemed to be driven 
by the SCT itself more than the effect of tagraxofusp; median OS results presented for patients that did 
not undergo a transplantation were similar to outcomes obtained with regular chemotherapy.  
Moreover, the single-arm trial design and the small sample size do not allow to conclude on the efficacy 
profile of tagraxofusp and supportive efficacy data from stage 4 did not bring reassurance as a lower 
efficacy profile in the target population was shown.  
Regarding  R/R  BPDCN  patients,  the  study  0114  was  not  designed  to  provide  any  conclusion  on  this 
population; no hypothesis, objectives or endpoints were planned for R/R BPDCN patients.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This safety assessment is based on an integrated safety analysis from one ongoing non-randomised, 
open-label, multicentre study (STML-401-0114, hereafter Study 0114) of tagraxofusp monotherapy in 
96 patients with AML (N=49) and BPDCN (N=47), and available data from 3 ongoing clinical studies 
with tagraxofusp in patients with haematological malignancies (STML-401-0214; N=16, STML-401-
0314; N=29; STML-401-0414; N=7).

Among the 32 first-line BPDCN patients, median duration of tagraxofusp exposure was 96 days (range 
2, 927+ days); the median number of cycles started was 5.0, with 81% of patients starting at least 4 
cycles of treatment. 
Among the 15 R/R BPDCN patients, median duration of exposure was 48 days (range 6, 138 days); the 
median number of cycles started was 3.0, with 47% of patients starting at least 4 cycles of treatment. 
All Applicant-Sponsored Studies 
An overall summary of patient disposition in all applicant-sponsored studies is presented in Table 62, 
overall and by study.  
Of  the  148  patients,  141  received  tagraxofusp  as  monotherapy  only  and  7  received  tagraxofusp  as 
monotherapy only for 1 cycle before receiving combination therapy with POM/DEX. Of the 141 patients 
treated with tagraxofusp monotherapy only: 
• 12 received tagraxofusp at 7 μg/kg/day. 
• 9 received tagraxofusp at 9 μg/kg/day. 
• 113 received tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg/day, the dose intended to be marketed. 
• 7 received tagraxofusp at 16 μg/kg/day.

Common Adverse Events of Interest 
Liver Transaminase Elevations 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
ALT increased and AST increased were the most common TEAEs among BPDCN patients (N=47). A 
summary of TEAEs representing liver transaminase elevations in BPDCN patients is presented in Table 
75, overall and by line of therapy. 
Table 75. Summary of Elevated Liver Transaminase TEAEs: First-Line and R/R BPDCN 
Patients in Study 0114, Overall and by Line of Therapy (Safety Population) 
A summary of the incidence of ALT increased and AST increased among BPDCN patients, including 
relationship, severity, seriousness and treatment discontinuation incidence, is presented in Table 76.  
Table 76. Incidence of ALT Increased and AST Increased: First-Line and R/R BPDCN 
Patients, Overall and by Relationship to Tagraxofusp, Severity, Seriousness, and

The most BPDCN patients who experienced ALT and AST increase did so in C1, with a notably lower 
incidence thereafter.  
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Findings for TEAEs related to liver transaminase elevations among all 141 patients in the SCS pool 
were generally similar to those among BPDCN patients, with ALT increased (55% [77/141]) and AST 
increased (51% [72/141]) being the most common TEAEs overall and treatment-related TEAEs overall

(46% [65/141] and 45% [64/141], respectively). The Grade 3 incidence of these events was 25% 
(35/141) and 24% (34/141), respectively.  
Capillary Leak Syndrome 
CLS is an identified risk with tagraxofusp. A summary of CLS TEAEs based on MedDRA preferred term 
reported among all patients in the SCS pool is presented in Table 77, overall and by indication/study. 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool

CLS was Grade 3 and Grade 4 in intensity for 4 and 2 patients, respectively. For 3 patients, 2 with 
BPDCN and 1 with AML, CLS was Grade 5. One patient discontinued tagraxofusp because of CLS. Of 
the 22 patients who continued treatment beyond C1, only 1 patient experienced a recurrence of CLS 
when retreated with tagraxofusp. This patient was enrolled in Study 0214, experienced Grade 2 CLS in 
C1 and then experienced a recurrence of CLS in C2, with the latter event assessed as Grade 3 and 
serious. Tagraxofusp was interrupted, and the event resolved in both cases. 
After the occurrence of a case of Grade 5 CLS during the dose-escalation phase of Study 0114 in a 
patient in the 7 μg/kg/day cohort, the protocol was amended (Amendment 6) to provide risk mitigation 
strategies for CLS. The incidence of ≥Grade 3 CLS before implementation of these changes was 17% 
(1/6 patients) and after implementation was 6% (8/135 patients). Furthermore, the rate of Grade 5 
CLS in particular decreased from 17% (1/6) before implementation of these changes to 1.5% (2/135) 
after implementation. 
Additional analyses were conducted on the data across all 96 patients in Study 0114. Findings revealed 
no notable differences in these categories of patients by sex, age, medical history, baseline disease 
burden or number of doses in C1.  
In Study 0114, all 19 patients who experienced CLS received IV albumin, with the median time to the 
first albumin infusion after initiating tagraxofusp being 1 day and a maximum time of 2 days. 
Review of laboratory data among patients with CLS in Study 0114 revealed an apparent downward 
trend in albumin levels over the 5-day period before the onset of CLS.  
Assessment report

CLS represents a constellation of symptoms that may occur concurrently or sequentially. Common 
signs and symptoms (incidence ≥ 20%) associated with these potential CLS cases that were reported 
during treatment with tagraxofusp include hypoalbuminaemia, oedema, weight gain, and hypotension. 
Hypoalbuminaemia 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
The overall incidence of potential CLS cases among the 81 patients who received 12 μg/kg/day 
tagraxofusp in Study 0114 was 54% (44 of 81 patients). Most cases (38 of 44, 86%) were Grade 1 or 
2 in severity. Grade 3 potential CLS events were reported in 4 patients (5%), Grade 4 in 1 patient 
(1%), and Grade 5 in 2 patients (2%). 
The incidence of hypoalbuminaemia among BPDCN patients is summarised in Table 78. 
Of note, 1 BPDCN patient discontinued tagraxofusp because of hypoalbuminaemia in the setting of 
CLS, with the latter event being fatal. 
Table 78. Incidence of Hypoalbuminaemia: First-Line and R/R BPDCN Patients in Study 
0114, Overall and by Relationship to Tagraxofusp, Severity, Seriousness, and 
Discontinuation of Treatment (Safety Population) 
Overall, hypoalbuminaemia occurred early during treatment, with a median time to first onset of 4 
days. The incidence of hypoalbuminaemia was notably higher in C1 than in C2 through C4, with none 
of the BPDCN patients experiencing hypoalbuminaemia after C4.  
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Findings for hypoalbuminaemia among all 141 patients in the SCS pool were similar to those among 
BPDCN patients. Overall, the incidence of hypoalbuminaemia was 55% (77/141) and of treatment-
related hypoalbuminaemia was 48% (68/141); thus, hypoalbuminaemia was considered treatment-
related for 68 of 77 patients who experienced it. Most patients who experienced hypoalbuminaemia did 
so in C1 or C2, with a notable decline in the incidence of this event thereafter.  
Oedema 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
The incidence of oedema events is summarised in Table 79 for all BPDCN patients, regardless of 
tagraxofusp dose. 
Oedema events were considered related to tagraxofusp for 8 of 24 patients. All but 1 oedema event 
were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. For most (30 of 32) patients who experienced an oedema event, no 
concurrent weight increase was reported. None led to treatment discontinuation. Incidence was higher 
at cycle 1 and lower thereafter.

An analysis of oedema events was not done specifically for all 141 patients in the SCS pool. 
Weight Increased 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
Overall, 38% (18/47) of BPDCN patients experienced the TEAE weight increased, with a slightly higher 
incidence in first-line BPDCN patients (41% [13/32]) than in R/R BPDCN patients (33% [5/15]). All 
cases of weight increased were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and non-serious and none led to tagraxofusp 
discontinuation. The incidence of weight increased was highest in C1 (26% [12/47]), with lower 
incidences thereafter. 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Overall, the incidence of weight increased was 28% (39/141). All cases of weight increased were 
Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and nonserious.  
Hypotension 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
Overall, 32% (13/47) of BPDCN patients experienced the TEAE of hypotension, with a higher incidence 
in R/R BPDCN patients (40% [6/15]) than in first-line BPDCN patients (22% [7/32]). Most cases of 
hypotension were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity; in 4 patients (9%) hypotension was Grade 3, including 1 
patient in which the event was serious in nature.  
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Overall, the incidence of hypotension was 26% (37/141). Most cases were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity; 10 
patients (7%) had Grade 3 (9 patients) or Grade 4 (1 patient) hypotension reported as a TEAE. Two 
patients had hypotension reported as an SAE and 1 patient withdrew from treatment due to 
hypotension. Most patients who experienced hypotension did so in C1 or C2, with a lower incidence of 
this event thereafter. 
Haematologic TEAEs 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
A summary of common (i.e., incidence ≥10%) haematologic TEAEs is presented in Table 80, overall

Review of time to onset of these common haematologic TEAEs showed that most patients who 
experienced thrombocytopenia and anaemia did so in C1; ≤4 patients experienced thrombocytopenia in 
any given cycle after C1 and ≤2 patients experienced anaemia in any given cycle after C1. A different 
pattern was seen for neutropenia, with a higher incidence seen in C2 to C4 than in C1. The incidence of 
leukocytosis was relatively low and similar across cycles.

All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Findings for haematologic TEAEs among all 141 patients in the SCS pool were similar to those among 
BPDCN patients; the incidences of thrombocytopenia, anaemia, and neutropenia were 38% (53/141), 
28% (39/141), and 14% (19/141), respectively. The Grade 3/4 incidence of thrombocytopenia was 31% 
(44/141),  with  32  of  these  patients  experiencing  Grade  4  thrombocytopenia.  Twenty-eight  (20%) 
patients  experienced  Grade  3  anaemia;  1  patient  reported  a  Grade  4  event.  Thirteen  (9%)  patients 
experienced  Grade  3/4  neutropenia,  with  11  patients  experiencing  Grade  4  neutropenia.  All  but  2  of 
these  common  haematologic  TEAEs  were  non  serious;  1  BPDCN  patient  experienced  serious

thrombocytopenia.  One  patient  in  Study  0314  discontinued  treatment  with  tagraxofusp  due  to  a 
haematologic TEAE, leukocytosis. Most patients who experienced thrombocytopenia did so in C1, with a 
notable decline in the incidence of such events thereafter, even with continued therapy. The incidence 
of  anaemia  and  neutropenia  changed  only  slightly  from  C1  (23%  [32/141]  and  9%  [13/141], 
respectively) to C2 to C4 (8% [11/141] and 8% [11/141], respectively). Four patients (3%) experienced 
anaemia and 1 patient experienced neutropenia after C4, indicating cumulative haematologic toxicity is 
not seen with tagraxofusp. 
Other significant events 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
In Study 0114, a medical review of AE terms was performed to identify TEAEs considered 
representative of potential IRRs; such events are presented in Table 82 for BPDCN patients, overall 
and by line of therapy, by MedDRA PT. 
Table 82. TEAEs Considered Representative of Infusion-related Reactions: First-line and R/R 
BPDCN Patients, Overall and by Line of Therapy, by MedDRA Preferred Term (Safety 
Population) 
Overall, 15% (7/47) of BPDCN patients experienced TEAEs considered representative of an IRR. 
One patient (first-line BPDCN) experienced angioedema on C1D5, an SAE. The event was characterised 
by tongue swelling and difficulty speaking, and tagraxofusp was interrupted. The patient was 
hospitalised and received treatment with diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, prednisone, cetirizine, 
and chlorhexidine, and the event resolved 9 days after onset. The Investigator considered this event to 
be Grade 3 in intensity and tagraxofusp related, although potentially related to the combined effects of 
tagraxofusp and a concomitant angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). The patient 
continued tagraxofusp despite this event, with no recurrence with continued treatment.

Review of the incidence of the specific MedDRA PT “infusion-related reaction” showed that in addition 
to the 2 BPDCN patients who experienced the TEAE IRR, 2 AML patients in Study 0114 experienced the 
TEAE IRR; thus, the incidence of this event in the SCS pool was 3% (4/141). This event was Grade 3 in 
intensity and serious for 2 patients, with the event leading to tagraxofusp discontinuation for 1 of these 
2 patients. This event was assessed by the Investigator as tagraxofusp-related for all 4 patients. 
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Analysis of the SMQ “Hypersensitivity” showed among all 141 patients in the SCS pool that 68 (48%) 
experienced at least 1 TEAE related to hypersensitivity; a summary of such events reported for >1 
patient is presented in Table 83.

Most hypersensitivity events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity and nonserious. Thirteen (9%) patients 
experienced a ≥Grade 3 hypersensitivity event, including 2 patients with Grade 5 events (both 
respiratory failure; one in Study 0114, and one in Study 0314). The first event was described by the 
Investigator as “pulmonary disease due to disease progression,” considered unrelated to tagraxofusp. 
The event of respiratory failure in the second patient was also considered unrelated to tagraxofusp. 
With the exception of 2 patients whose treatment was interrupted because of TEAEs considered related 
to tagraxofusp (Study 0114, [Grade 4 respiratory failure] and [Grade 3 angioedema; both BPDCN]), all 
other patients continued tagraxofusp despite the occurrence of a hypersensitivity event. 
Overall, a hypersensitivity event was serious for 9 (6%) patients, including pneumonitis and 
respiratory failure (3 patients [2%] and 4 patients [3%], respectively) and single <1% cases of allergic 
transfusion reaction, angioedema, and rash. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Overall, 11 (8%) patients experienced tumour lysis syndrome, including 5 (11%) of 47 BPDCN patients 
and 2 (4%) of 49 AML patients in Study 0114 and 4 (14%) of 29 patients in Study 0314, all of whom 
received tagraxofusp at 12 or 16 μg/kg/day. This event was considered by the Investigator to be 
tagraxofusp-related for 5 of these 11 patients. All but 1 case of tumour lysis syndrome were ≥Grade 3 
in intensity and 3 cases were serious. Tumour lysis syndrome was Grade 5 in intensity for 1 AML 
patient (Study 0114, Patient 07-004; AML; 16 μg/kg/day), with this event considered by the 
Investigator to be secondary to disease progression and unrelated to tagraxofusp. 
Among the 7 patients who experienced tumour lysis syndrome in Study 0114, 3 patients, including 1 
each with AML, first-line BPDCN, and R/R BPDCN, had the event occur in the setting of progressive 
disease after starting at least 2 cycles of tagraxofusp. Tumour lysis syndrome was considered 
unrelated to tagraxofusp for all 3 of these patients. The remaining 4 patients experienced tumour lysis 
syndrome in C1, with the onset occurring after 1 or 2 doses of tagraxofusp in most patients, 
suggesting that tagraxofusp may cause rapid tumour lysis as a result of its anti-tumour activity. 
Eye Disorders 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 145/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Overall, 18% (26/141) of patients experienced a TEAE within the MedDRA SOC “eye disorders.” The only 
eye disorders that occurred for >2 patients overall were vision blurred (verbatim terms blurred vision, 
blurry vision, or fuzzy vision) (6% [8/141]) and conjunctival haemorrhage (4% [6/141]). 
One BPDCN patient experienced a serious eye disorder, eye pain, which was considered secondary to 
facial skin lesions and unrelated to tagraxofusp. 
Veno-Occlusive Disease 
In Study 0114, patients may have undergone SCT after experiencing a tagraxofusp-induced remission 
or after receiving alternate therapy subsequent to discontinuing tagraxofusp. A total of 3 of 26 patients 
who  underwent  SCT  at  any  time  after  tagraxofusp  treatment  in  Study  0114  were  reported  to  have 
experienced VOD post-SCT, with 2 of these patients receiving alternate therapy before SCT. The risk of 
VOD has been attributed to conditioning regimens and specific chemotherapeutics used in preparing a 
patient  for  SCT.  Further,  given  that  2  of  the  3  patients  underwent  intervening  therapy  before  the 
diagnosis of VOD, it is unclear if tagraxofusp played a role in the event.  
Choroid Plexitis 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with tagraxofusp in primates performed prior to enrollment in 
Investigator-sponsored Study 50047 revealed choroid plexitis as a potential drug-associated toxicity.  
To monitor for this potential toxicity in the clinic, assessments for headaches and neurological signs 
and symptoms were required in Investigator-sponsored Study 50047 among the patients treated with 
Regimen A (dosing every other day for up to 6 doses). There were no clinical findings consistent with 
this toxicity. Consequently, this monitoring was removed from the protocol for Regimen B (daily dosing 
× 5) and was not employed in Stemline-sponsored studies. No findings consistent with this toxicity 
were seen among the 46 patients treated with Regimen B in Study 50047 or the 141 patients in the 
SCS pool. 
Serious adverse event/deaths 
A summary of SAEs reported for >1 patient in the SCS pool, by MedDRA SOC and PT is presented in

Grade 1 or 2 Haematology Values at Baseline Who Shifted to Grade 3 or 4 Abnormalities as 
Worst Value on Study (Safety Population) 
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
According to the applicant, evaluation of haematology results among all patients in the SCS pool (as of 
the  data  cutoff  of  25  Sep  2017)  yielded  findings  similar  to  those  seen  in  BPDCN  patients,  with  no 
meaningful changes over time during treatment with tagraxofusp. 
Liver Function Tests 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
Baseline median ALT and AST were both 22.0 U/L among all BPDCN patients in Study 0114. With regard 
to ALT, progressively greater median increases from baseline in ALT were seen over the dosing period 
in C1 among all BPDCN patients. Thereafter, a return toward baseline in median ALT was seen by C2Inf1. 
A similar, but notably less pronounced pattern was seen in C2. 
Kaplan-Meier analysis of time to first onset of elevated ALT was performed for BPDCN patients treated 
with tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg/day. The median time to first onset of ALT >3×ULN was short, irrespective 
of line of therapy, occurring 0.8 and 0.3 months after treatment initiation in first-line and R/R BPDCN 
patients, respectively. 
Progressively greater median increases from baseline also were seen in AST over the dosing period in 
C1 among BPDCN patients, with a maximum median increase of 90.0 U/L seen on C1D8. Thereafter, a 
return to baseline in median AST was seen by C2Inf1. With regard to AST, 40% (19/47) and 2% (1/47) 
of BPDCN patients with normal AST or Grade 1 or 2 AST at baseline experienced a shift to Grade 3 or to 
Grade 4 elevated AST, respectively. 
Two first-line BPDCN patients in this study met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law, 1 based on the ALT 
and bilirubin criteria, and 1 based on AST and bilirubin criteria. The first patient’s ALT level decreased to 
57 U/L by C2D21, and then returned to normal range by C2Inf1 (actual value 24 U/L). AST at that time 
was 21 U/L. Similarly, the bilirubin level decreased to normal range (8.6 μmol/L) at the same time. No 
subsequent  ALT  elevations  were  reported  for  this  patient.  The  patient’s  ALP  values  remained  within 
normal  range  at  all-time  points  assessed.  No  associated  clinical  events  were  reported.  This  patient 
discontinued tagraxofusp due to progressive disease 1 day after C7Inf1. The second patient died as a 
result of CLS 2 weeks after C1Inf5; the event of CLS was considered tagraxofusp-related.

Albumin 
The impact of tagraxofusp on changes in albumin levels during treatment are difficult to evaluate, given 
guidance within the protocols to actively manage and supplement albumin since hypoalbuminaemia may 
be a harbinger of impending or a symptom of active CLS. 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
Among  BPDCN  patients  in  C1,  during  which  albumin  supplementation  was  common  (64%  [30/47]), 
relatively small median decreases in albumin levels were seen over the infusion period. Over subsequent 
cycles, small median changes in albumin also were seen, with no median decreases seen at any time 
point through the end of C6.  
All Patients in the Summary of Clinical Safety Pool 
Among all 125 patients included in the analysis through the 25 Sep 2017 cut-off, in C1, during which 
albumin supplementation was common (42% [52/125]), relatively small median decreases in albumin 
were seen over the infusion period; thereafter, no median decrease from baseline in albumin was seen 
at any time point through the end of C6. Furthermore, no patient experienced a treatment-emergent 
shift to Grade 3 or 4 hypoalbuminaemia during the study. 
Electrocardiogram Findings 
Patients with BPDCN in Study 0114 
Neither acute nor chronic treatment with tagraxofusp was associated with consistent changes in any of 
the ECG variables of HR, PR, QRS, or QTcF. On ECGs recorded pre-dose on tagraxofusp infusion days, 
most changes from baseline were small and negative. The 90% upper confidence limit for ΔQTcF was 
below the threshold of regulatory concern on all 34 post-baseline occasions in BPDCN patients. No patient 
experienced Torsades de pointes (Study 0114). 
Five  (11%)  BPDCN  patients  had  electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged  reported  as  a  TEAE.  None  of  these 
patients experienced syncope or pre-syncope; only 1 had associated cardiac TEAEs (1 patient had 2 AEs 
of sinus tachycardia). No cases were considered serious or led to treatment discontinuation. Overall, 2 
(4%) BPDCN patients had a clinically significant abnormal ECG finding at any time on study, including 1

first-line patient with ECG evidence of sinus tachycardia pre-infusion at C1Inf5 and 1 R/R BPDCN patient 
with ECG evidence of sinus tachycardia at C1Inf2. 
Overall, 34% (16/47) of BPDCN patients had a cardiac disorder reported as a TEAE, with most individual 
cardiac disorders reported in 1 or 2 patients only. The only cardiac disorders reported for >2 patients 
were tachycardia (7 patients; 15%) and sinus tachycardia (3 patients; 6%).

experienced a tagraxofusp-related cardiac disorder, most commonly tachycardia (8 patients; 6%) and 
sinus tachycardia (4 patients; 3%). A serious cardiac disorder was considered tagraxofusp-related for 2 
patients,  including  1  case  each  of  ventricular  fibrillation  (Study  0114)  and  pericardial  effusion  (Study

Immunological events 
In study 0114 
Immune response to SL-401 was assessed using two immunoassays. The first assay detected reactivity 
directed against SL-401 (ADA) and the second assay detected reactivity against the IL-3 portion of SL-
401 (AIA). 
Results - ADA 
The baseline summary and characterisation of ADAs for all patients is shown in Table 91 by disease and

The  characteristics  of  immune  response  to  tagraxofusp  were  expected  given  the  high  childhood  and 
booster diphtheria vaccination rate in the population: 
•  The  majority  of  patients  with  baseline  samples  available  (96%;  140/146),  regardless  of  disease 
diagnosis, were positive for ADAs at baseline; 23% of patients were ADA NAb-positive at baseline. 
• Of the 131 evaluable patients (i.e. patients with baseline and post-baseline samples available), 126 
(96%) had ADA reactive antibodies at baseline and 29 (23%) were also NAb positive. 
• By the end of treatment, all 131 evaluable patients (100%) were ADA-positive and 116 (89%) of the 
130 tested were NAb-positive. 
• The ADA titre increased by C1D15 and remained stable over the study course with minor differences 
between dose groups. The peak increase in titre (1000-fold) was reached by C2D15. The maximum titre 
of 80,000,000 was observed in more than one patient and in multiple cycles. 
In contrast, 99% (144/146) of patients with samples available were negative for AIA at baseline. 
The hIL-3 immune response was characterised as follows: 
• Of the 132 evaluable patients, 130 (98%) were AIA-negative at baseline and 2 (2%) were AIA-positive; 
both AIA-positive patients were NAb negative at baseline. 
• After treatment, 97 (73%) of the 132 evaluable patients were AIA-positive and 74 (76%) of the 97 
were NAb-positive. 
• The AIA titre median titre started to increase Cycle 2 with peak median titres at C4D15.

than  in  the  22  patients  who  were  ADA  NAb-negative  at  baseline.  At  C3D1,  the  difference  in  AUClast 
between  patients  who  were  ADA  Nab-positive  and  patients  who  were  ADA  Nab-negative  at  baseline, 
although  statistically  significant,  was  small  with  a  non-estimable  95%  CI  for  the  between-group 
difference. Other ADA measurements did not impact levels of measurable drug.

thrombocytopenia,  and  pyrexia,  with  each  of  these  events  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be 
tagraxofusp-related, and transient ischaemic attack, which was considered unrelated.  
Additional information 
Additional data from stage 4 of trial 0114 
Updated safety data from stage 4 of trial 0114 has been provided. Overall, 44 patients with BPDCN 
were treated with tagraxofusp; 42 of these received a lyophilized formulation and 2 patients received a 
frozen formulation. Safety data was presented by formulation and line of therapy (FL and R/R). Only 
data from BPDCN patients were included in the presented pools.  
Summary tables included most common TEAES (≥10% of patients), treatment-related TEAEs, most 
common (≥ 5%) grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, all treatment-related grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, AESIs, and SAEs. 
Fewer patients receiving lyophilized DP experienced TEAEs which may be considered signs and 
symptoms of CLS compared to the liquid formulation, such as hypoalbuminemia (45% vs 55%), 
peripheral oedema (31% vs 51%), weight increased (31 % vs 38%), hypotension (19% vs 28%). 
However, similar proportions in both pools had a diagnosis of CLS (21% vs 19%, respectively), all of 
which were considered related to treatment with tagraxofusp. Similar proportions experienced grade ≥ 
3 CLS in both pools (10% vs 6%, respectively). More patients in the lyophilized pool experienced a SAE 
of CLS compared to the liquid formulation (17% vs 9%). This may be a reflection of higher vigilance by 
the investigators in Stage 4 of the trial, resulting in prolonged hospitalizations due to CLS, considering 
the emerging safety profile of tagraxofusp.  
Five patients in Stage 4 treated with the lyophilized formulation of tagraxofusp, died from a TEAE.  
These were: 2 events of myocardial infarction, 1 event of CLS, 1 event of intracranial haemorrhage, 1 
event of lung infection. Two of these deaths were considered treatment-related by the investigator: 
one case of CLS and one case of myocardial infarction concurrently with CLS.  
Post marketing experience 
Tagraxofusp was authorised in the US for the treatment of BPDCN (first-line and R/R) for adult and 
paediatric patients 2 years of age and older in December 2018. Since then and through March 2020, 97 
patients were treated with tagraxofusp by 80 individual prescribers. In addition, tagraxofusp is 
available outside the US via an Early Access Program (EAP), under which 18 patients have been treated 
with tagraxofusp by 16 individual prescribers (all in the EU). 
Safety data are collected as part of routine pharmacovigilance. Key safety data through April 2020 are 
summarised: 
•  79 individual case study reports (ICSRs) have been submitted. 
•  The most commonly reported toxicity was CLS (22 individual cases, representing 28% of 
reported cases). Pyrexia, decreased albumin and increase in hepatic enzymes (8 cases each, 
10% of reports cases) were also commonly reported. 
•  39 ICSRs were assessed as serious. 
Assessment report

•  Ten cases had fatal outcomes, of which 6 were reported in patients experiencing CLS (the 
remaining 4 were in patients experiencing tumour lysis syndrome [n=2] and disease 
progression [N=2]). If considering all fatal cases in which CLS was reported as death due to 
CLS, the rate of fatal CLS is approximately 5%, consistent with the rate of fatal occurrences 
during clinical trials. 
•  Risk mitigation procedures recommended in the US label and proposed for the SmPC are 
effectively employed in the post-authorisation setting, minimising the risk of fatal events.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety results of tagraxofusp in BPDCN population are mainly coming from the study STML-401-0114 
(study 0114). Supportive safety data from studies 0214 (for adverse risk AML), 0314 (for advanced 
high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasms) and 0414 (for R/R multiple myeloma) have been provided. All 
these studies are Phase I/II open-label and one-arm treatment. Therefore, there is no available data of 
tagraxofusp compared to other available therapies.  
Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) pool included data from studies 0114, 0214 and 0314. Among all 
Applicant-Sponsored Studies, a total of 141 patients received tagraxofusp as monotherapy (SCS pool); 
from these, only 113 patients received tagraxofusp at the intended dose (12 μg/kg/day). Overall, 96 
patients were enrolled in the study 0114; 47 BPDCN (32 first-line and 15 R/R) and 49 AML patients. 
From these BPDCN patients, 3 first-line BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 7 µg/kg/day, 29 first-

line BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day, and 15 R/R BPDCN patients received 
tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day.  
According to data provided from study 0114, median duration of exposure to tagraxofusp was 96 days 
(approximately 3.2 months) and 48 days (approximately 1.6 months) for first-line and R/R BPDCN, 
respectively. The median number of started cycles were 5.0 cycles and 3.0 cycles for first-line and R/R 
BPDCN, respectively. The median relative dose intensity was 98.71% for first-line BPDCN patients and 
92.00% for R/R BPDCN patients. 
Two different pharmaceutical forms (solution vs lyophilized powder) were administered to the full study 
population.  
At DCO, 2 (4.3%) first-line BPDCN patients were still ongoing on treatment at study 0114. The primary 
cause for treatment discontinuation was disease recurrence/progression (48.9% for BPDCN and 51.0% 
for AML patients); this is in line with the results of study 0214 (56.3%) and study 0314 (34.5%). 
Discontinuation due to AEs was only a 4.3% (2/47) for BPDCN patients at study 0114.  
The majority of the enrolled BPDCN population were males (83.0%). Asian (4.3%), black (0%) or 
other (2.1%) race were poorly represented within the study population. Median age was 69.0 years old 
(range 22 – 84 years old). All the BPDCN patients presented an ECOG PS score between 0 (46.8%) 
and 1 (53.2%). The demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients included are considered 
as well representative of the BPDCN patients excluding the race distribution. 
All the BPDCN patients in the study 0114 reported a TEAE during the study and 87.2% of the total 
(87.5% first-line and 86.7% R/R BPDCN) reported TEAEs were considered drug-related. Moreover, 
higher percentage of R/R vs first-line BPDCN patients reported Grade ≥3 TEAEs (86.7% vs 78.1%) and 
SAEs (66.7% vs 40.6%). Tagraxofusp TEAE leading to discontinuation was only reported in 3.1% of 
the first-line BPDCN patients and in none of the R/R BPDCN patients (0%). TEAE leading to death were 
equally reported in both populations (6.3% first-line and 6.7% R/R). These results were generally in 
line with data provided from other studies. 
Most common (≥20%) TEAEs in all the BPDCN population were ALT increased (63.8%), AST 
increased (59.6%), hypoalbuminaemia (55.3%), oedema peripheral (51.1%) and thrombocytopenia 
(48.9%), fatigue (44.7%), pyrexia (44.7%), nausea (46.8%), weight increased (38.3%), 
hyperglycaemia (36.2%), chills (34.0%), hypotension (27.7%), headache (25.5%), decrease appetite 
(25.5%), back pain (25.5%), anaemia (23.4%), constipation (23.4%), hypocalcaemia (23.4%), 
hypokalaemia (21.3%) and hypertension (21.3%). Results were mostly in line with the ones obtained 
for the SCS pool.  
Results of TEAEs reported by ≥10% of patients in the SCS pool by cycle showed that in most of the 
cases AEs were reported with higher frequency and intensity in cycle 1 and 2 than in cycle 3 and 
beyond.  
Overall, 87.2% (41/47) of the BPDCN patients reported at least one treatment-related TEAE. The 
most common reported tagraxofusp-related TEAEs (>20%), as assessed by the Investigator, occurring 
in all the BPDCN population were hypoalbuminaemia (51.1%), ALT increased (51.1%), AST increased 
(51.1%), thrombocytopenia (36.2%), pyrexia (29.8%), weight increased (27.7%), chills (27.7%) and 
nausea (23.5%). Results were mostly in line with the ones obtained for the SCS pool. 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported at least once for 80.9% (38/47) of the total of the BPDCN patients. 
The most common ≥Grade 3 TEAEs reported were thrombocytopenia (31.2%), ALT increased (24.8%), 
AST increased (24.1%) and anaemia (19.9%). Results were similar for the patients of the SCS pool. 
SAEs were reported at least once in 48.9% (23/47) of the BPDCN patients. The most common 
reported TESAEs were Capillary leak syndrome (8.5%), pyrexia (6.4%), AST increased (4.3%) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 163/207 
 
 
  
  
 
hypertension (4.3%). Overall, 57.4% (81/141) patients in the SCS pool reported at least one TESAEs 
and 26% (36/141) were considered as related to tagraxosfusp. Tagraxofusp-related SAEs reported for 
>1 patient included CLS (16 patients; 11%); febrile neutropenia (3%); AST increased (2%); and IRR, 
pyrexia, and pulmonary oedema (each 2%). 
Among all the BPDCN patients, 3 cases of Grade 5 TEAEs/deaths were reported; 2 cases of CLS in 
first-line patients as tagraxofusp-related and 1 case of respiratory failure in R/R reported as not 
related. In the SCS pool, 11% (16/141) of the patients experienced at least one Grade 5 TEAEs. 
Among all the cases, 3 cases of CLS and one case of cerebrovascular accident were assessed by the 
Investigator as tagraxofusp-related. All other Grade 5 TEAEs were considered unrelated.  
TEAE leading to dose discontinuation was reported in 2% (1/47) in the full BPDCN population and 
11% (15/141) of patients in the SCS pool discontinued tagraxofusp because of a TEAE. Overall, 68.1% 
of all the BPDCN patients reported any TEAE leading to dose interruption (80/141 patients; 57% in 
the SCS pool) and 2.1% reported any TEAE leading to dose reduction (3/141 patients; 2% in the 
SCS pool). 
AESIs 
Liver transaminase Elevations - ALT and AST elevations were reported as adverse reactions in 46% 
(62/134) and 44% (60/134) of patients treated with Elzonris monotherapy, respectively. ≥ Grade 3 ALT 
and AST increased were reported in 23% (31/134) and 22% (30/134), respectively. Elevated liver 
enzymes occurred in the majority of patients in cycle 1 and were reversible following dose 
interruptions. Similar onset time and incidence were observed in patients with BPDCN, with 51% 
(24/47) of patients experiencing adverse events of ALT and AST elevations, with 34% (16/47) being ≥ 
Grade 3. Two patients with BPDCN met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law; in both cases the 
laboratory abnormalities were noted during Cycle 1.  
In addition, two first-line BPDCN patients in this study met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law but 
none of the cases were considered treatment-related by Investigator. Overall, 21.3% (10/47) 
presented Grade 1 ALP increased and, approximately, 8/47 patients (17%) presented TBL increased. 
Capillary Leak Syndrome was reported in 17% (23/134), with 12% (16/134) Grade 2, 3% (4/134) 
Grade 3, 1% (1/134) Grade 4, and fatal in 1% (2/134). Of the 22 patients that resumed treatment 
after experiencing an event of CLS, only 1 patient experienced a recurrence of CLS. The median time 
to onset of CLS was short (6 days), with all but 2 patients experiencing the first onset of CLS in cycle 
1. No patient experienced the first onset of CLS after cycle 2. The overall incidence of CLS was similar 
in patients with BPDCN (19%, 9/47), including 13% (6/47) Grade 2, 2% Grade 4 (1/47) and 2 fatal 
cases (4%).  
Similar CLS mitigation strategies as those included in the clinical trial protocols for tagraxofusp have 
been incorporated in the proposed SmPC. These include requirement for in-patient administration of 
the first cycle of tagraxofusp and CLS management guidelines including requirement for adequate 
cardiac function and serum albumin before initiating therapy; monitoring of signs/symptoms of CLS 
during dosing and recommendations for treatment interruptions; albumin supplementation in case of 
reduced serum albumin levels (see also the discussion on updated safety data below).  
Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Capillary Leak Syndrome 
Hypoalbuminaemia was reported at least once in 55.3% (24/47) of all BPDCN patients. Events were < 
grade 3 and non-serious and maximal shift observed in albumin levels from intensity Grade 0 or 1 was 
Grade 2; only one case lead to discontinuation. Incidence was higher at cycle 1 and lower thereafter. 
Albumin supplementation was common (64% [30/47]). In the clinical trials, 42% of patients overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 164/207 
 
 
  
  
 
received albumin supplementation in cycle 1 of treatment. Findings for hypoalbuminaemia in the SCS 
pool were similar to those among BPDCN patients. 
The study protocol for the main study 0114 has evolved from the earlier versions, where albumin 
supplementation was recommended if serum albumin < 3.0 g/dL, and threshold for withholding dosing 
was < 2.7 g/dL, and to recent versions, where supplementation is recommended at albumin levels < 
3.5 g/dL, and threshold for withholding dosing is set to < 3.2 g/dL or 0.5 decrease from baseline in 
current cycle. Thus, it is anticipated that even higher proportions of patients will be needing albumin 
infusions according to the SmPC management guidelines, and more patients will have treatment 
interruptions. Theoretically, the use of albumin for prevention of CLS in tagraxofusp-treated patients 
with low or decreasing albumin levels can be understood based on the reverse oncotic effect and the 
potentially longer residence time in serum compared to saline. The mitigation strategy included in the 
proposed SmPC is supported. 
Haematologic TEAEs - Any blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported in at least 68.1% 
(32/47) of all BPDCN patients. Events as thrombocytopenia, anaemia and neutropenia were 
experienced at a higher incidence by first-line compared to R/R patients, whereas, event as febrile 
neutropenia, leucocytosis, leukopenia and lymphopenia presented a higher incidence in R/R population. 
The most common events were thrombocytopenia (48.9%), anaemia (23.4%) and neutropenia 
(17.0%). The majority of the thrombocytopenia events were grade 3 with a maximum shift to grade 4 
(19.1%). The majority of the anemia events were grade less than 3. None of all the reported event led 
to discontinuation. Findings for haematologic TEAEs among all 141 patients in the SCS pool were 
similar to those among BPDCN patients; 
Other events of interest were: 1) infusion related-reactions [14.9% (7/47)]; 2) hypersensitivity 
reactions [48.9% (23/47)], it was serious for 9 (6%) patients, including pneumonitis and respiratory 
failure (3 patients [2%] and 4 patients [3%], respectively) and single (<1%) cases of allergic 
transfusion reaction, angioedema, and rash; 3) tumour lysis syndrome [11% (5/47)], the majority 
of these event were Grade ≥ 3 in intensity and serious; 4) eye disorders [18% (26/141) – including 
blurred vision in 6% (8/141) and conjunctival haemorrhage in 4% (6/141); 5) veno-occlusive 
disease (VDO) [11.5% (3/26 patients that underwent SCT)], 2 of these patients receiving alternate 
therapy before SCT; 6) choroid plexitis, it was not monitored in study 0114 as no clinical findings 
consistent with this toxicity in study Study 50047 part A(only 45 patients were followed during 1 cycle 
of treatment). 
Choroid plexitis is rare event difficult to identify in clinical practice with a potential fatal outcome that is 
not considered sufficiently followed during tragraxofusp clinical development (only 45 patients from 
D1-12 in 1 cycle of treatment). Due to non-clinical findings together with issues of clinical events on 
the CNS reported suggest that this risk of developing any disorders in the choroid plexus is not 
sufficiently characterised. It has been included as an important potential risk in the RMP and a non-
clinical study is recommended to be performed. Further, close monitoring would be needed in the post- 
authorisation setting.  
ECG findings 
In total, six (4%) patients in the SCS pool had a TEAE of QT prolonged. The event was assessed as 
grade 3 intensity for 2 of the patients. No cases were serious or led to treatment discontinuation. 36% 
of patients had a cardiac related TEAE. 10% of patients experienced a tagraxofusp-related cardiac 
event, most commonly tachycardia (6%), and sinus tachycardia (3%). Serious tagraxofusp-related 
cardiac disorders were one case of ventricular fibrillation and one case of pericardial effusion (refer to 
section on SAEs).

From the 96 patients enrolled in study 0114, 85 patients were evaluable for immunogenicity 
analysis; 31 first-line BPDCN patients, 14 R/R BPDCN patients and 40 AML patients. Immune 
response to tagraxofusp was assessed using two immunoassays to detect; 1) reactivity directed 
against tagraxofusp (ADA – anti DT antibodies) and 2) reactivity against the IL-3 portion of 
tagraxofusp (AIA).  
ADA Analysis  
As expected, due to the high diphtheria vaccination rate of the population, 90% (28/31) and 93% 
(13/14) of the first-line and R/R BPDCN patients, respectively, were ADA-positive at baseline. Among 
them, results showed that; i) 21% (6/28) and 23% (3/13) of the first-line and R/R BPDCN patients, 
respectively, presented neutralising antibodies (NAb-positive) at baseline, ii) 96% (27/28) and 85% 
(11/13) of the first-line and R/R BPDCN patients, respectively, presented boosted ADA (≥ 100-fold titer 
increase) after being administered tagraxofusp, and iii) the maximum fold increased titer for treatment 
boosted-ADA for first-line BPDCN patients was of 100,000 and was reached at C2D15, C2D21 and 
C4D21; for R/R BPDCN patients was of 1.000.000 and was reached at C2D21. 
Among the evaluable ADA-negative BPDCN patients at baseline (9% - 3/31 and 7% - 1/14, first-line 
and R/R, respectively), results showed; i) 100% of the first-line and R/R BPDCN patients presented 
boosted ADA after tragaxofusp, and ii) the maximal peak positive titer was reached at C2D15 for the 
all the BPDCN population. 
Overall, all the BPDCN population presented ADA increased levels after the beginning of treatment; 
reported incidence of treatment-boosted + treatment-induced ADA [97% and 86% for first-line and 
R/R, respectively]. NAb-positive incidence after treatment were between 96% (27/28) and 92% 
(12/13), for first-line and R/R, respectively. 
According to the presented data, the high ADA titer remained mostly stable over the following 5 cycles 
study course. 
AIA Analysis  
Almost all of the patients were AIA-negative at baseline; only 1 patient (7%) from the R/R BPDCN 
population was AIA-positive. Results showed similar results for both first-line and R/R BPDCN 
population with incidence of treatment-induced AIA [90 (28/31) first-line & 92% (12/13) R/R] and a 
maximum fold increased titer of 51200 that was reached at C3D15. Almost all the patients were AIA 
positive after treatment and results of total AIA Nab-positive incidence was little higher for first-line 
patients (27/28-96%) compared to R/R patients (10/13-77%). 
The AIA titers increased through C3D15 and then generally remained stable over the study course for 
patients with BPDCN with some fluctuations in R/R BPDCN patients. 
To conclude, due to the high diphtheria vaccination rate of the population, almost all the BPDCN 
patients were ADA-positive at baseline whereas almost all of the patients were AIA-negative at 
baseline. All the BPDCN population presented ADA & AIA increased levels after the beginning of the 
treatment. Most of ADA & AIA were neutralizing antibodies. 
A post-hoc analysis was performed with several comparisons to assess the clinical impact of the 
immunogenicity profile of tagraxofusp. According to the results obtained, the applicant concluded that 
no efficacy or safety parameters analysed demonstrated a statistically significant result.  
Tagraxofusp is apparently triggering heavy hypersensitivity-related reactions in the patients, like 
cytokine release syndrome; respiratory failure; rash (generalised / maculo-papular); wheezing; 
pruritus; angioedema; swelling face; and flushing. Capillary leak syndrome and tumour lysis syndrome 
may also be related to hypersensitivity and is relatively frequent in the Tagraxofusp safety population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 166/207 
 
 
  
  
 
To be able to elucidate potential influence on safety, the applicant was asked to submit data from each 
patient on ADAs (anti-tagraxofusp and anti-hIL3; titres, neutralising activity, NAb positive or negative 
at baseline) correlated with adverse effects that potentially can be associated with hypersensitivity 
reactions (infusion–related reactions, acute reactions, delayed hypersensitivity reactions). No firm 
conclusion can be drawn as information provided for assessment regarding impact of the presence of 
anti-drug antibodies was inconclusive. The applicant concluded that this toxicity was not likely due to 
immune complex formation which is considered acceptable.  
Updated safety data from stage 4 of trial 0114 has been provided. The safety profile of tagraxofusp 
appears similar in stage 4 compared to previously assessed data, even if both pharmaceuticals forms 
of tagraxofusp (liquid vs lyophilized) are not yet confirmed to be comparable. Some differences were 
noted that are not considered meaningful to discuss in detail. However, the updated safety data 
support an unfavourable toxicity profile of tagraxofusp. Deaths from CLS events continue to occur. A 
related death event of myocardial infarction concurrently with CLS was reported. The effectiveness of 
the measures to minimize the CLS risk is, thus, questionable as it seems not to prevent serious events 
of CLS to occur. Further, serious events in CNS with fatal outcome continue to occur. In this sense, a 
toxic effect of tagraxofusp on the plexus choroid cannot be dismissed. 
Safety data from patients treated with the lyophilised formulation has not been yet assessed for ADRs 
frequency calculations. 
Related to post-marketing data from US provided during the procedure, 97 patients were treated from 
tagraxofusp since December 2018 from 80 different prescribers. Additionally, 18 patients have been 
treated with tagraxofusp by 16 prescribers in EU by an early access program. 
Overall, 79 ICSRs were submitted (68.7%); the most comment reported toxicities were CLS (22/79- 
28%), pyrexia, decreased albumin and increased hepatic enzymes (8/79- 10%, each). Almost the half 
of these cases were serious (39/79- 49.3%). This seems to be a large number of reports considering 
the number of patients treated and indicates the severe safety profile of tagraxofusp.  Overall, 10 
cases led to a fatal outcome (12.7% - 10/79). From these fatal cases, 6 cases were due to CLS (6/79- 
7.6%), 2 cases due to tumour lysis syndrome and 2 cases due to disease progression. 
The proportion of deaths due to CLS post-marketing (6/115) was somewhat higher than what was 
seen in clinical trials (3/47). CLS does not seem to be manageable, as deaths do occur despite 
extensive risk mitigation procedures. The CLS management guidelines should be reviewed and 
suggestions should be provided as seemed not to prevent severe cases to occur according to post-MA 
data provided and the PASS results would not be available at short term (however, the issues 
identified in the application prevent recommending granting a marketing authorisation). 
Besides, events which may be associated with CLS, such as pyrexia and decreased serum albumin, 
increases in hepatic enzymes and liver function tests were commonly reported post-marketing. 
The proportion of deaths due to TLS seem to be also higher in the post-authorisation setting than in 
clinical trials (1/47); two fatal cases of TLS were reported post-marketing. The warning about TLS in 
SmPC section 4.4 should be updated to indicate that TLS may be fatal with tagraxofusp (however, the 
issues identified in the application prevent recommending granting a marketing authorisation). 
In addition, four events of atrial fibrillation were reported. Atrial fibrillation is not currently included in 
the SmPC section 4.8 table over ADRs. The applicant was asked to clarify the causality assessment for 
these reports, and to include the event as an ADR, if relevant (however, the issues identified in the 
application prevent recommending granting a marketing authorisation). 
In this sense, the safety profile of tagraxofusp seen in clinical trials could have been underestimated 
probably due to the limitations of the study design and the small sample size as evidenced by post-

marketing data.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Tagraxofusp showed an unfavourable safety profile with high incidence and high level of seriousness of 
the events reported, mainly related to hepatotoxicity, capillary leak syndrome and haematological 
abnormalities. Hypersensitivity reactions, fatigue, pyrexia and pain were also frequent adverse 
reactions to tagraxofusp.  
Significant safety issues have been identified with tagraxofusp. Specifically, the potentially fatal 
adverse drug reaction capillary leak syndrome occurred frequently in the applicant-sponsored clinical 
trials. Overall incidence in the SCS pool to date is 18% of patients (26/141). Of the 26 CLS events, 9 
patients (35%) experienced a grade ≥3 event. 3 of the 26 patients (11%) died from a CLS event. 
Although mitigation strategies were implemented in the protocols after the first death due to CLS, it 
has not proven to be entirely preventable, with more deaths occurring after implementation. Further, 
the impact of other potential risks, e.g. hepatotoxicity, excessive amount of antibodies (ADAs) which 
might lead to severe immunogenicity reactions, are still unknown. 
Entire safety database is based on data from single-arm trials in different diseases. In this context, the 
causality of the adverse events is difficult to demonstrate as they can be due to the drug effect, 
disease, aging or other factors. Moreover, the total number in SCS pool was 141 patients and among 
them, there were only 47 BPDCN patients treated with tagraxofusp in solution form with limited follow-
up period.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that tagraxofusp has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers tagraxofusp to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The purpose of the current submission is to seek marketing approval for Elzonris (Tagraxofusp) in the 
following indication:  
Elzonris is indicated as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid 
dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), previously known as blastic Natural killer (NK) cell 
lymphoma is an exceedingly rare haematological disorder derived from the precursor of plasmacytoid 
dendritic cells (pDCs) currently categorized under acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor 
neoplasms in the 2008 World health organization classification. BPDCN is a rare hematologic malignancy, 
highly aggressive, rapidly progressive, with a complicated diagnosis, where no consensus of standard 
treatment and no approved therapies. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently,  there  is  no  consensus  regarding  the  optimal  treatment  modality  for  BPDCN.  Several 
treatments,  including  multi-agent  chemotherapy  regimens,  symptomatic  approaches  (e.g.  local 
radiation), and intensive chemotherapy with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, are generally 
used to treat patients.  
Although chemotherapy regimens used for acute leukemia or lymphoma are often effective at inducing 
an initial response, the duration of response is typically brief and recurrent disease is generally resistant 
to  chemotherapy.  While  longer  overall  survival  has  been  reported  with  allogeneic  hematopoietic  cell 
transplantation, especially in younger patients many relapses have been observed after such transplants. 
Achievement of high rates of durable response in patients with BPDCN with a targeted agent with the 
potential  for  patients  to  be  bridged  to  SCT,  while  avoiding  the  morbidity  and  mortality  observed  with 
chemotherapy regimens would be potentially very impactful in this disease.

The main evidence of efficacy of tagraxofusp in patients with BPDCN is derived from study 0114. This 
was a multistage, phase 1/2, nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study of tagraxofusp in nine 
study centers in the US, in patients with BPDCN and AML initiated in June 2014 and is ongoing at the 
time of the submission.  
Favourable effects 
The study has reached its primary endpoint, among first-line BPDCN patients in stage 3, CR rate (CR 
+ CRc) was 53.8% (7/13) (95% CI: 25.1% - 80.8%). From the 7 first-line BPDCN patients with BM 
disease at baseline, BMCR rate was 85.7% (6/7) (95% CI: 42.1% - 99.6%) and the median duration 
of the BMCR was not reached. 
Moreover, among all 29 first-line BPDCN patients treated with tagraxofusp at 12 μg/kg/day, CR 
rate (CR + CRc) was 72.4% (21/29) (95% CI: 52.8, 87.3). These results were also supported by 
secondary endpoint: 
i)  the median duration of the CR that was not reached through a median duration of follow-up of 
24.9 months (95% CI: 20.9, 30.6) for the updated time-to event analyses of 03 October 
2018,  
ii) among the 14 first-line BPDCN patients with BM disease at baseline, BMCR rate was 92.9% 
(13/14) (95% CI: 66.1% - 99.8%) and the median duration of the BMCR was not reached,  
iii) almost half of the patients were bridged to SCT [44.8% (13/29)], of these, 10 (77%) were 
alive and still in response as of the updated time-to event analysis, 
iv) median OS was 18.0 months (95% CI: 9.7- NE) with a 58.6% probability of survival at 18 
months and median PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI: 4.3 - NE). 
v)  ORR rate was 89.7% (95% CI: 72.6, 97.8) with a median duration of OR of 24.9 months 
(95% CI: 2.5 - NE), 
In addition, among the 13 patients who achieved an objective response but were not bridged to SCT (6 
with CR, 3 with CRc, and 4 with PR), six (46%) were alive at the time of the first data cut-off, with 
survival ranging from 11 to 30 months, including two patients with long-standing and ongoing 
responses (24 and 37 months). 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The Study 0114 is a single-arm clinical trial with a low number of patients for the analysis population 
(29 first-line and 15 R/R). It is therefore difficult to draw any firm conclusions without a control arm. In 
the literature, recent studies have shown comparable efficacy results when first line BPDCN patients 
have been treated with chemotherapy regimens (Poret 2015 and Pemmaraju 2017). Still, comparison 
with external sources is questionable due to the lack of prospective studies, standard response criteria 
and analogous population. In addition, the robustness of the effect size is uncertain leading to a 
possible variability in results. A difference between CR rate in Stage 3 vs Stage 1/2 (53.8% vs 87.5%) 
was indeed observed without obvious explanation with regards to baseline data.  
Tagraxofusp showed a high rate of patients bridged to SCT. No detrimental effect of tagraxofusp over 
the SCT. However, in the context of a single arm trial, it cannot be excluded that investigator’s choice 
to proceed to HSCT was partly influenced by the knowledge of the type of treatment. The calculation of 
duration of responses was performed irrespectively whether a patient has undergone SCT or not; thus, 
the real duration of the responses due to tagraxofusp is still misled. Further, the effect on OS 
presented in CSR seemed to be driven by the SCT itself more than to the effect to tagraxofusp; median 
Assessment report

Page 170/207 
 
 
  
  
 
OS results presented for patients that did not undergo a transplantation were similar to outcomes 
obtained with regular chemotherapy.  
Regarding R/R BPDCN patients, the study 0114 was not designed to provide any conclusion on this 
population; no hypothesis, objectives or endpoints were planned for R/R BPDCN patients. Moreover, 
efficacy results did not reveal clear evidence of clinical benefit of the treatment with tagraxofusp in 
these patient but a positive trend; CR rate was 13.3% (2/15) (95% CI: 1.7% - 40.5%), ORR rate was 
67% (10/15) (95% CI: 38.4% - 88.2%)with a median OR duration of 1.6 months (95% CI: 0.7 - 3.6) , 
only one patient was bridged to SCT, median PFS was 2.6 months (95% CI: 0.6- 3.6) and median OS 
was 7.1 months (95% CI: 4.1- 11.9).  
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The total safety database for tagraxofusp consists of 239 patients, about half of these stemming from 
a less rigidly conducted investigator-sponsored trial (91 patients, including 10 patients with BPDCN). 
The safety profile of tagraxofusp was largely similar in patients with haematological malignancies 
across the studied indications (mainly BPDCN and AML, with few patients included with diagnoses of 
other haematological neoplasms). 
Most common (≥20%) TEAEs in all the BPDCN population were ALT increased (63.8%), AST 
increased (59.6%), hypoalbuminaemia (55.3%), peripheral oedema (51.1%) and thrombocytopenia 
(48.9%), fatigue (44.7%), pyrexia (44.7%), nausea (46.8%), weigh increased (38.3%), 
hyperglycaemia (36.2%), chills (34.0%), hypotension (27.7%), headache (25.5%), decrease appetite 
(25.5%) , back pain (25.5%), anaemia (23.4%), constipation (23.4%), hypocalcaemia (23.4%), 
hypokalaemia (21.3%) and hypertension (21.3%). Results were mostly in line with the ones obtained 
for the SCS pool. 
≥Grade 3 TEAEs were reported at least once for 80.9% (38/47) of the total of the BPDCN patients. 
The most common ≥Grade 3 TEAEs reported were thrombocytopenia (31.2%), ALT increased (24.8%), 
AST increased (24.1%) and anaemia (19.9%). Results were similar for the patients of the SCS pool. 
Treatment-Emergent SAEs were reported at least once in 48.9% (23/47) of the BPDCN patients. 
The most common reported SAEs were Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) (8.5%), pyrexia (6.4%), AST 
increased (4.3%) and hypertension (4.3%). Overall, 57.4% (81/141) patients in the SCS pool reported 
at least one SAEs and 26% (36/141) were considered as related to tagraxosfusp. Tagraxofusp-related 
SAEs reported for >1 patient included CLS (16 patients; 11%); febrile neutropenia (3%); AST 
increased (2%); and IRR, pyrexia, and pulmonary oedema (each 2%). 
Among all the BPDCN patients, 3 cases of Grade 5 TEAEs were reported; 2 cases of CLS in first-line 
patients as tagraxofusp-related and 1 case of respiratory failure in R/R reported as not related. In the 
SCS pool, 11% (16/141) of the patients experienced at least one Grade 5 TEAEs. Among all the cases, 
3 cases of CLS and one case of cerebrovascular accident were assessed by the Investigator as 
tagraxofusp-related. All other Grade 5 TEAEs were considered unrelated.  
TEAE leading to dose discontinuation was reported in 2% (1/47) in the full BPDCN population and 
11% (15/141) of patients in the SCS pool discontinued tagraxofusp because of a TEAE. Overall, 68.1% 
of all the BPDCN patients reported any TEAE leading to dose interruption (80/141 patients; 57% in 
the SCS pool) and 2.1% reported any TEAE leading to dose reduction (3/141 patients; 2% in the 
SCS pool). 
Assessment report

Page 171/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Events as liver transaminase elevations, capillary leak syndrome and haematologic TEAEs were 
considered as AESIs. Other events of interest were: infusion related-reactions, hypersensitivity 
reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, eye disorders, veno-occlusive disease and choroid plexitis. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Entire safety database is based on data from single-arm trials in different diseases. In this context, the 
causality of the adverse events is difficult to demonstrate as they can be due to the drug effect, 
disease, aging or other factors. Thus, weighing the safety profile of tagraxofusp against other 
chemotherapy treatments currently used for treatment of BPDCN is difficult. 
Moreover, the total number in SCS pool was 141 patients and from them, there were only 47 BPDCN 
patients with limited follow-up period. The small size of the safety database adds uncertainty to the 
frequency estimates for the observed adverse effects, and ADRs with lower frequencies may not have 
been observed, or may not have been correctly attributed to the true cause. The relatively short 
follow-up time is a limitation to discern potential long-term effects of tagraxofusp. Therefore, the 
safety profile of tagraxofusp could remain uncertain due to the lack of information. Safety due to long-
term exposure is still uncertain as the median duration of exposure were 5 cycles (96 days) in first-line 
and 3 cycles (48 days) in R/R BPDCN patients and there is evidence of 2 patients treated for more than 
20 cycles that reported a high number of TEAEs after cycle 4. 
Within the safety reporting period of 30 days after the last dose of tagraxofusp in the applicant-
sponsored studies, sixteen (11%) deaths occurred in the SCS pool; 12 of them occurred within the 10 
days after dosing. Due to the scarcity of information about the events, and lack of applicant discussion 
of the causality assessment, the extent to which treatment with tagraxofusp may be fatal is still 
uncertain. For the purpose of estimating tagraxofusp-related mortality, considering the very small 
number of BPDCN patients in the clinical trials, the entire tagraxofusp-treated patient population 
should Have been taken into account even if these events were classified as unrelated. 
The most important uncertainties about the unfavourable effect are related to risk of: i) capillary leak 
syndrome, associated with an apparent insufficient management algorithms for minimisation, ii) 
hepatotoxicity, with a high frequency of increased ALT and AST events, 2 identified cases of Hy’s law 
and an uncertain risk of DILI. In addition, choroid plexitis, which is a rare event difficult to identify in 
clinical practice with a potential fatal outcome that is not considered sufficiently followed during 
tragraxofusp clinical development (only 45 patients from D1-12 in 1 cycle of treatment). Non-clinical 
findings together with issues of clinical events on the CNS reported suggest that this risk of developing 
any disorders in the choroid plexus is not sufficiently characterised and close monitoring would be 
needed in the post authorisation setting. The risks of ‘hypersensitivity’, ‘haematological abnormalities’ 
and ‘tumour lysis syndrome’ are considered sufficiently characterized. However, these undesirable 
clinical outcomes will have to be closely followed in the PSUR. 
 In relation to the immunogenic profile of tagraxofusp, the clinical impact on safety of the presence of 
antidrug antibodies, ADA (anti-DT antibodies) & AIA (anti-IL3 antibodies), is still uncertain. Despite 
toxicity seemed not to be likely related to the immune complex formation as it is mostly reported in 
cycles 1 and 2, the high titer of ADA and AIA that was observed during the full treatment course of 
tagraxofusp and the limited safety data on long-term exposure did not allow to draw any firm 
conclusion. According to data provided from the post-authorisation setting, the safety profile of 
tagraxofusp seen in clinical trials could have been underestimated probably due to the limitations of 
the study design and the small sample size. Further, the high rate of deaths due to CLS reported in the 
post-marketing setting called into question the RMM for this risk.

contemporary controls was not feasible. In non-transplanted patients, two observations (out of 16) 
showed unusual prolonged responses, possibly indicating a benefit even without transplantation. 
However, median OS results presented for patients that did not undergo a transplantation were similar 
to outcomes obtained with regular chemotherapy. 
These effects are however observed in a small single-arm trial limiting the robustness of the results. 
Responses unequivocally show the activity of tagraxofusp, even in such a non-comparative setting. 
Many factors of confusion (such as specifics of the included population, external factors contributing to 
outcomes) render the effects on more relevant endpoints (DoR, proportion of patients amenable to 
transplantation, OS) less certain and of disputable interpretation. Further, supportive efficacy data 
from stage 4 did not bring reassurance as a lower efficacy profile in the target population was shown. 
In relapse or refractory patients, the very limited set of exploratory data probably prevents any firm 
conclusion on a clinical benefit. Further, R/R patients may represent a different population in terms of 
phenotype expression and the loss of target expression (CD123) was not investigated. 
Tagraxofusp showed an unfavourable safety profile with high incidence and high level of seriousness of 
the events reported, mainly related to hepatotoxicity and capillary leak syndrome. Many treatment 
interruptions could indicate that this treatment presents a poorly manageable safety profile. The safety 
profile of tagraxofusp is different compared to intensive chemotherapy; while hypersensitivity reactions 
and potentially fatal AEs like CLS were related to tagraxofusp, the rate of haematological toxicity 
seems to be a limited problem. Further, the effectiveness of the algorithms for risk minimization and 
the impact of other potential risks are unknown. 
Moreover, it is of concern that overall 11% of patients in the pooled safety population died within one 
month after dosing with tagraxofusp; most worrisome is the potentially fatal adverse drug reaction 
CLS, which occurred frequently in the applicant-sponsored clinical trials. Indeed, post authorisation 
safety data provided showed unfavourable safety profile of tagraxofusp and called into question the 
risk minimisation measures for CLS as a high rate of death due to this type of events were reported. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Due to limitation in the study design, methodological issues, uncomprehensive efficacy results and 
uncertainties on the management of the safety profile the overall Benefit/risk of tagraxofusp is 
negative.

4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Elzonris as a monotherapy in the 
treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), the CHMP 
considers by majority decision that the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 174/207 
 
 
  
  
 
is not sufficiently demonstrated and, therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the 
marketing authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
In the context of a one-pivotal-trial scenario, the evidence in support of the claimed indication of 
tagraxofusp as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell 
neoplasm (BPDCN) is considered insufficient: 
• 
The pivotal 4 cohort phase I/II study has important limitations rendering the benefit of 
tagraxofusp not robustly demonstrated in the context of a single pivotal trial with a non-
randomised design and a small sample size. A total of 84 BPDCN patients (n=65 first line and 
n=19 second line) have been enrolled.  
•  Statistical analysis was only planned for cohort 3 of the study in which a total of 13 first line 
patients were enrolled. Study 0114 was thus not designed to detect a particular magnitude of 
effect in the BPDCN population as studied.  
• 
Pivotal efficacy results showed an anti-disease activity in cohort 3 with a complete response 
rate (CR/CRc) of 53.8%. However: 
i) The magnitude of the efficacy response was highly heterogeneous across the 4 stages; 
ii) It is not clear why CR rate and HSCT decreased over time in the successive cohorts; 
iii) The activity seen in second line are unlikely to represent benefit for the second line 
population; 
iv) The safety profile is not well characterized. 
• 
Therefore, taking into account these concerns in the context of a limited and heterogenous 
dataset, the CHMP cannot conclude that efficacy has been robustly shown. Together with the 
uncertainties on the safety profile, B/R cannot be established. 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling, 
package leaflet, pharmacovigilance system, risk management plan and follow-up measures to address 
other concerns as outlined in the list of outstanding issues cannot be agreed at this stage. 
Furthermore, following review of the available data in the context of the applicant’s claim of new active 
substance status, the CHMP position at the time of this report is reflected in section 2.9 (new active 
substance). However, in light of the negative recommendation, the CHMP is of the opinion that it is not 
appropriate to conclude on the new active substance status at this time.  
Divergent position(s) to the majority recommendation are appended to this report.

5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 23 July 2020 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Elzonris was not approvable based on the efficacy and safety 
grounds outlined above, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of the 
grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The applicant presented in writing and at an oral explanation the following detailed grounds for re-
examination. 
A summary of the applicant’s grounds for re-examination is presented below. 
Ground for refusal number 1  
The pivotal 4 cohort phase I/II study has important limitations rendering the benefit of tagraxofusp not 
robustly demonstrated in the context of a single pivotal trial with a non-randomised design and a small 
sample size. A total of 84 BPDCN patients (n=65 first line and n=19 second line) have been enrolled. 
Ground for re-examination number 1 
Applicant  study  0114  was  the  first  prospective  clinical  trial  in  BPDCN.  This  was  a  well-designed, 
multi-cohort single-arm trial (SAT) conducted over 6 years, representing exploratory, confirmatory and 
open-access  phases  of  drug  development.  Although  SATs  are  not  always  adequate,  the  applicant  has 
considered  that  SATs  have  successfully  established  efficacy  in  other  haematological  or  rare  disease 
indications. The reasons why a SAT was considered appropriate for this submission is discussed below, 
together with the adequacy of the sample size and robustness of the data produced.  
Single-arm Design  
Control arms in clinical trials, with allocation of patients to treatments by randomisation, are particularly 
important when baseline factors are prognostic for outcomes and, related to this, where the response to 
control is not fully predictable. Randomisation promotes balance in prognostic factors (and unmeasured 
confounders) between treatment groups and is important when needing to  set an index  date (e.g. to 
measure time to event variables).  Thus, randomisation to allocate patients to different treatment arms 
is important for the majority of trials.  However, these considerations do not apply to the assessment of 
complete  response  in  haematology  trials,  in  which  response  in  the  absence  of  treatment  is  fully 
predictable.  
A  SAT  was  therefore  considered  appropriate  to  provide  the  evidence  of  treatment  efficacy  in  BPDCN, 
given that the direct therapeutic effect of an intervention can be measured by achievement of complete 
disease remission. CR/CRc is the maximal therapeutic response that can be achieved and does not occur 
spontaneously, i.e. without an effective intervention. Furthermore, the importance of complete response 
to  an  individual  patient  with  BPDCN  is  well  characterized.  Complete  response  shows  not  only  direct 
evidence of treatment efficacy in an individual patient, but is an appropriate variable on which to quantify 
the  magnitude  of  the  beneficial  effect  across  a  population,  wherein  all  complete  responses  can  be 
attributed to a drug effect; hence a control arm is not required. Other important efficacy variables, such 
as duration of response, can only be assessed in a cohort of patients in which a remission is induced; a 
naïve  comparison  between  durations  of  remission  in  patients  achieving  remission  on  treatment  and 
patients achieving remission on a control arm would anyway not describe a treatment effect. This point 
provides further rationale for the decision to use a SAT.

The applicant maintains that the beneficial effects of treatment can be established and quantified based 
on a SAT. 
Robustness of Trial 
Specific measures and procedures were implemented to ensure the robustness of the clinical dataset: 
● 
Inclusion  /  exclusion  criteria  were  prospectively  defined  and  consistent  across  study  stages 
except for Stage 3, that by definition, only enrolled first-line patients.  
●  All  patients  with  BPDCN  enrolled  in  the  trial  were  required  to  have  histologically  and/or 
cytologically-confirmed  BPDCN  by  pathologic  assessment  according  to  the  2008  WHO 
classification by a pathologist with expertise in haematologic malignancies. 
●  Pathology  material  was  submitted  for  review  by  a  central  pathologist  for  confirmation  of  the 
diagnosis  of  BPDCN,  and  this  confirmation  was  required  for  a  patient  to  be  included  in  the 
efficacy analysis. 
●  Baseline  disease  was  thoroughly  assessed  by  bone  marrow  biopsy/aspirate,  computed 
tomography (CT) scans for lymphadenopathy and visceral disease, blood sampling for peripheral 
blasts and cytopenias, and the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) and skin 
biopsy for evaluation of skin disease. 
●  Stringent  response  criteria  considering  all  disease  manifestations  were  developed  in 
collaboration with medical experts in BPDCN. Based on these criteria, CR required normalisation 
of  blast  percentage  in  the  bone  marrow,  normalisation  of  absolute  neutrophil  and  platelet 
counts, absence of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood, 100% clearance of all skin lesions 
present  at  baseline,  regression  of  nodal  masses  to  normal  size  on  CT  scan,  and  nonpalpable 
spleen/liver  with  no  nodules.  As  part  of  the  response  criteria,  a  new  response  designation, 
clinical CR (CRc) was introduced to describe a specific response to treatment that included all 
the features of a CR in non-skin sites of disease, with the skin having clinically inconsequential 
residual  skin  abnormality,  that  would  not  clinically  be  considered  active  disease  (CRc  was 
validated prior to its inclusion in the primary efficacy analysis).  
Furthermore, the included patients had similar demographics and baseline characteristics to what is seen 
in the real-world setting, rendering the results relevant to the intended population. 
As a result, the clinical dataset generated in this study is robust and enables an assessment of the benefit 
of tagraxofusp in the intended population. 
Sample Size 
The sample size is considered adequate to estimate the effects of treatment with sufficient precision to 
enable a  benefit-risk assessment, with a lower bound of the 95% CI of 32.5% in the pooled data for 
Stages 3 and 4 and 44.0% for the pooled data cross all 4 stages of the trial. 
Conclusions 
In summary, complete response will not occur without effective treatment, regardless of the patient’s 
pre-treatment  demographic  or  clinical  characteristics.  As  such,  all  complete  responses  seen  can  be 
attributed to tagraxofusp’s effect, allowing the magnitude of effect to be assessed. This is a key point of 
why a SAT was considered appropriate. Additionally, the sample size is adequate to produce sufficient 
precision to enable a benefit-risk assessment. In theory, the sample size in the study would represent 
approximately  10-15%  of  the  EU  BPDCN  ultra-rare  population  (Bueno,  2004;  Wang,  2012)  and  the 
included patients had similar demographics and baseline characteristics to what is seen in the real-world 
setting, rendering the results relevant to the wider population.

Ground for refusal number 2 
Statistical analysis was only planned for cohort 3 of the study in which a total of 13 first line patients 
were enrolled. Study 0114 was thus not designed to detect a particular magnitude of effect in the 
BPDCN population as studied. 
Ground for re-examination number 2 
As per the 0114 study design and pre-specified statistical approach, the treatment effect of tagraxofusp 
in first-line patients was estimated in 3 separate cohorts (Stages 1-2, Stage 3, and Stage 4), with efficacy 
confirmed in a prospectively designed pivotal stage (Stage 3). 
The sample size for Stage 3 was calculated to provide at least 90% power at a two-sided Type I error 
rate of 0.05 to reject a null hypothesis that the rate of complete response (CR+CRc) was ≤ 10%, if the 
true  rate  was  60%.  These  assumptions  were  considered  appropriate  to  enable  an  assessment  of  the 
efficacy of tagraxofusp given the knowledge that therapeutic intervention is an absolute requirement for 
achievement of any response in this disease (i.e. spontaneous disease remission cannot occur), and the 
substantial treatment effect required to reject the null hypothesis on the basis of that sample size. 
Indeed, rejection of the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint in Stage 3 was achieved at the pre-
specified  significance  level.  Importantly,  while  a  10%  rate  of  complete  remission  was  used  to  define 
clinically meaningless efficacy for the purpose of sample size calculation (based on advice from medical 
experts in BPDCN and the lack of any authorised therapies or standard of care), the lower bound of the 
95% confidence interval in each stage of the study was far higher than this, at > 25%, which cannot be 
considered a clinically meaningless rate. Although a statistical hypothesis was not pre-specified for the 
entire sample of 65 patients, the hypothesis test in Stage 3 was pre-specified to establish that a beneficial 
effect  exists  and  the  observed  results,  by  stage  or  pooled,  can  be  interpreted  for  assessment  of  the 
magnitude  of  that  effect,  with  the  pooled  results  allowing  sufficient  precision  for  an  assessment  of 
benefit-risk.  
As previously discussed, patients with R/R BPDCN represent a population that is more difficult to treat 
and with worse prognosis than first-line patients. While no hypothesis testing was specified to estimate 
the magnitude of treatment efficacy in this population, the biological similarity of the disease to first-line 
patients render the therapeutic target, CD123, scientifically relevant and the observed results showed a 
treatment effect that is clinically meaningful given the very poor prognosis of this population and the 
unmet medical need. 
Ground for refusal number 3 
Pivotal efficacy results showed an anti-disease activity in cohort 3 with a complete response rate 
(CR/CRc) of 53.8%. However: 
i) The magnitude of the efficacy response was highly heterogeneous across the 4 stages; 
Ground for re-examination number 3 
It is understood that the concerns expressed in Parts i) and ii) relate not to the meaningfulness of the 
observed  CR/CRc  rate  per  se,  but  to  the  perception  that  the  percentage  of  responders  (in  first-line 
patients)  varies  across  the  different  stages  of  the  study  and  that  a  lower  effect  in  Stage 4  presents 
uncertainties for the use of tagraxofusp in the real-world setting. Furthermore, it is also understood that 
the concern relates to both the primary endpoint of complete response rate as well as to the percentage

of patients who bridged to SCT. As i) and ii) are inextricably linked, the response below addresses them 
jointly.   
Results in first-line patients for complete response and SCT rates are summarized in Table 100:

Complete Response Rate in First-Line Patients 
The treatment effect is strong and clinically meaningful in all stages. The applicant acknowledges that 
the complete response rates in Stage 3 and Stage 4 are lower than in Stages 1 and 2. However, it is 
well-known in drug development that  exploratory stages typically show higher treatment  effects than 
later confirmatory stages. Thus, this was not unexpected and the treatment effect in Stages 3 and 4 was 
nonetheless strong with clinically meaningful complete response rates.  
Furthermore,  the  complete  response  rates  in  Stage  3  and  Stage  4  are  similar  (53.8%  and  44.4%, 
respectively), as indicated by overlapping 95% CIs. The magnitude of response is clinically meaningful 
with acceptable precision as the lower bound of the 95% CI in each study stage is > 25%.

The demographics/baseline characteristics of the patients in the 0114 clinical trial are consistent with 
the intended population to be treated in a real-world setting. As such, there is no basis to consider that 
complete response rates in the real-world setting will be lower than what has been seen in the 0114 
clinical trial. 
GfR number 3 ii) It is not clear why CR rate and HSCT decreased over time in the successive cohorts; 
Percentage of First-Line Patients Who were Bridged to SCT 
The percentage of patients who bridged to SCT was similar between Stage 1 and 2 and Stage 3 (43.8% 
in Stage 1and 2, 46.2% in Stage 3). However, despite similar complete response rates in Stage 3 and 
Stage 4,  a  difference  in  the  percentage  of  patients  bridging  to  SCT  was  observed  (46.2%  in  Stage 3, 
22.2%  in  Stage 4).  The  applicant  considers  that  these  differences  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with 
complete response versus the proportion bridging to SCT across the different stages are unrelated to the 
drug  effect,  especially  as  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  meeting  CR/CRc  were  identical  across  the 
different stages of the trial. A proposed explanation is that multiple confounding factors that influence 
whether a patient undergoes SCT, such as age, fitness, comorbid conditions, availability of a suitable 
transplant donor etc., may have led to the heterogeneity seen. The applicant recognizes that the decision 
to proceed to SCT is multifactorial and that SCT rates, while clinically important, are not a direct measure 
of  the  drug’s  magnitude  of  effect.  However,  CR  provides  direct  evidence  of  a  drug  effect  because  all 
BPDCN patients have a disease in need of induction therapy as a first measure, prior to consideration for 
future transplant which requires induction-induced remission as a pre-requisite. 
In summary, the complete response rate is a direct measure of tagraxofusp’s effect and is the appropriate 
basis on which to estimate the magnitude of that effect. The aim of the study was to confirm and quantify 
a beneficial effect of the drug, and this was achieved as evidenced by the high complete response rates 
across all stages of the clinical trial. Differences in complete response or SCT rates across trial stages is 
not unexpected in cohorts that are not large in absolute terms.  What is critical is that each stage and 
the pooling between stages established a relevant magnitude of effect for complete response rates to 
enable a benefit-risk assessment. The effects of tagraxofusp were demonstrated by the high complete 
response rates presented in this Response. Furthermore, duration of response was long enough to enable 
a substantial proportion of patients (32.3% [21/65] overall) to bridge to SCT, thereby providing further 
evidence of efficacy as all BPDCN patients need to achieve disease remission before proceeding to SCT.  
GfR number 3 iii) The activity seen in second line are unlikely to represent benefit for the second line 
population 
As broadly accepted in the acute leukaemia setting, patients with R/R BPDCN represent a population that 
is more difficult to treat and with worse prognosis than first-line patients. While research is ongoing to 
elucidate  potential  resistance  mechanisms  and  other  factors  that  result  in  worse  outcomes  for  these 
patients,  both  newly-diagnosed  and  recurring  BPDCN  arise  from  proliferation  of  malignant  pDCs  that 
ubiquitously express CD123 at high levels, suggesting that CD123 is an important therapeutic target in 
both  first-line  and  R/R  patients  (Togami, 2019;  Angelot-Delettre,  2015;  Haubner 2019);  indicate  that 
CD123 expression is present on BPDCN cells from both first-line and R/R patients, rendering treatment 
with tagraxofusp scientifically valuable . Furthermore, clinical benefit was observed in some patients as 
3  (15.8%)  patients  achieved  a  complete  response,  one  of  whom  bridged  to  SCT.  Responses  in  the 
remaining 8 patients who achieved an objective response were Cri in 3 (15.8%) patients and PR in 5 
(26.3%) patients. Median overall survival in the 19 R/R BPDCN patients was 8.2 months with a range of 
0.6 to 27.1 months. It should be noted that some of the R/R patients were heavily pre-treated (i.e. this

group  did  not  only  include  second-line  patients)  as  40%  of  patients  had  received  two  or  more  prior 
therapies; these patients, in particular, may be considered the most difficult to treat.  
GfR number 3 iv) The safety profile is not well characterized 
The applicant considers the safety profile of tagraxofusp has been characterized. This response provides 
a summary of the safety experience to date from the clinical trials and post-marketing US/EAP in Europe 
setting. 
At the time of the MAA submission in January 2019, the safety database, in addition to the pivotal Study 
0114 in BPDCN patients, included safety data from 3 other applicant-sponsored studies of tagraxofusp, 
in haematologic malignancies other than BPDCN:  
•  Study  STML-401-0214  (study  0214),  a  Phase  1/2  non-randomized,  open-label,  2-stage  dose-
escalation  study  of  tagraxofusp  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  adverse  risk  AML  in  first  or 
second CR, with or without evidence of minimal residual disease in first CR. 
•  Study  STML-401-0314  (study  0314),  a  Phase  1/2  non-randomized,  open-label,  2-stage  dose-
escalation  study  of  tagraxofusp  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced,  high-risk 
myeloproliferative neoplasms. 
•  Study  STML-401-0414  (study  0414),  a  Phase  1/2  non-randomized,  open-label,  2-stage  dose-
escalation  study  of  tagraxofusp  in  combination  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  in 
patients with R/R multiple myeloma.  
Overall,  safety  data  from  148  patients  treated  in  four  clinical  studies  of  tagraxofusp  in  haematologic 
malignancies (including study 0114) were included in the initial MAA (data cut-off 25 September 2017), 
primarily from 141 patients who received multi-cycle treatment with tagraxofusp as monotherapy. This 
included three first-line BPDCN patients who received tagraxofusp at 7 mcg/kg/day, 29 first-line BPDCN 
patients who received tagraxofusp at 12 mcg/kg/day as well as 15 R/R BPDCN patients who received 
tagraxofusp at 12 mcg/kg/day. 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  safety  database  looking  at  age,  sex,  weight  and  ECOG  performance  status 
revealed no major demographic differences across the subgroups and the demographic characteristics 
of the BPDCN patient population was consistent with that reported in the published literature. 
As part of the responses to the Day 180 List of Questions, the applicant provided updated safety data 
from a total of 176 patients included in the monotherapy studies treated with tagraxofusp ≤ 12 mcg/kg 
including all 89 patients with BPDCN treated in Stages 1 through 4 of study 0114 (86 were treated at 
the to-be marketed dose of 12 mcg/kg/day), 42 patients with AML treated in study 0114, and 45 patients 
with haematologic malignancies treated in studies 0214 and 0314 (data cut-off June 2019).  
These  data  were  further  supplemented  by  safety  data  from  ‘real-world’  usage  collected  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance  from  commercial  supply  in  the  US,  where  tagraxofusp  has  been  licensed  for  the 
treatment  of  first-line  and  R/R  adult  and  BPDCN  paediatric  patients  2  years  of  age  and  older  since 
December 2018. Data from 110 US patients treated between December 2018 and June 2020 have been 
submitted,  as  well  as  safety  data  from  26  EU  patients  treated  with  tagraxofusp  via  an  early  access 
programme. 
The applicant also plans to complement these data with a clinical Post-Approval Safety Study (PASS), 
the  design  of  which  was  agreed  with  the  Agency  during  review  based  on  the  main  safety  concerns 
associated with tagraxofusp use and is detailed in the Risk Management Plan. This non-interventional 
category  3  PASS  has  a  primary  objective  to  assess  the  incidence  of  capillary  leak  syndrome  (CLS)  in 
approximately 125 adult patients actively treated for BPDCN in routine practice in the EU compared to 
clinical studies. Secondary objectives currently include: (i) evaluation of the distribution of CLS severity; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 181/207 
 
 
  
  
 
(ii)  evaluation  of  data  on  dose  interruptions  and/  or  the  administration  of  intravenous  albumin 
supplementation  in  patients  presenting  with  a  diagnosis  or  symptoms  of  CLS  (i.e.  hypoalbuminemia, 
oedema, weight gain and/or hypotension); (iii) evaluation of the incidence and severity of hepatotoxicity 
in patients actively treated for BPDCN in routine practice and; (iv) describing the available safety data 
of  tagraxofusp  monotherapy  in  patients  with  significant  cardiovascular  history,  hepatic  impairment 
and/or severe renal impairment. 
While the collection of further informative safety data are awaited, a number of measures are proposed 
which are designed to: (i) Restrict the usage of tagraxofusp to patients consistent with those studied in 
clinical trials who have sufficient cardiac, renal and hepatic function prior to treatment. Testing related 
to  these  parameters  will  be  required  before  start  of  treatment  and  prior  to  each  dose;  (ii)  Manage 
potential adverse reactions which primarily occur at the start of treatment by requiring tagraxofusp to 
be administered in an in-patient setting in cycle 1. Consistent with other biologic agents used in oncology, 
patients are to be pre-treated before each infusion to reduce risk of hypersensitivity and/or anaphylaxis 
and;  (iii)  Provide  detailed  safety  information  via  routine  pharmacovigilance  with  specific  follow  up 
questionnaires  for  renal,  hepatic  and  cardiac  events.  In  addition,  the  applicant  will  offer  training  to 
healthcare professionals to advise them before any tagraxofusp is given to the site’s first patient. 
Overall Safety Profile 
Acceptable safety has been demonstrated in a sizeable dataset (up to June 2019) of 176 patients treated 
with  monotherapy  in  clinical  trials  and  an  additional  128  patients  treated  in  the  post-marketing/EAP 
setting. Importantly, the post-marketing/EAP experience is thus far consistent with the adverse events 
seen  in  the  clinical  trials,  especially  with  regard  to  CLS,  which  is  the  most  important  identified  risk 
(discussed  further  below).  The  clinical  trial  data  showed  that  most  adverse  events  were  transient, 
manageable and did not accumulate over cycles of therapy, and importantly, there was no prolonged 
myelosuppression. Notably, the safety profile in study 0114 was similar across older patients compared 
with middle-aged and younger patients.  
Deaths 
21 deaths occurred within 30 days of last tagraxofusp dose in the clinical studies (all dose, monotherapy). 
This is out of a total population of 190 treated patients (148 from original SCS population and 48 patients 
with BPDCN in Stage 4 of study 0114), up to June 2019. The death rate is thus 11%, which is lower than 
death  rates  of  17%  and  26%  reported  in  the  literature  with  combination  chemotherapy  for  BPDCN 
(Pagano 2013, Martin-Martin 2015). Four of the deaths were due to CLS, which equates to a CLS death 
rate of 2.1%. The bolded events in the ‘Cause of Death’ column were considered by the investigator to 
be treatment related. 
In the US post-marketing/European EAP setting, there have been 10 ICSRs with a fatal outcome out of 
128 patients treated to June 2020. This equates to a death rate of 7.8%. Four ICSRs indicated CLS as 
the cause of death. This equates to a CLS death rate of 3.1%, which is consistent with that seen in the 
clinical trial setting.

Capillary Leak Syndrome 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS), a progressive condition characterised by a constellation  of symptoms, 
including hypoalbuminemia, oedema, weight gain, and hypotension, that may present simultaneously or 
sequentially,  is  an  adverse  reaction  associated  with  tagraxofusp  and  has  been  seen  in  other  fusion 
proteins with a similar structure (McCann 2012) and with other commonly used antineoplastic agents 
(Jeong  2019),  including  gemcitabine,  fludarabine  and  cytarabine.  Therefore,  treating  oncologists  are 
familiar with recognising and treating CLS. 
In Stages 1-3 of study 0114, 47 BPDCN patients were treated with tagraxofusp (32 first-line [3 treated 
with 7 mcg/kg and 29 with 12 mcg/kg] and 15 R/R [all treated with 12 mcg/kg]): 
•  Overall,  9  (19%)  of  47  patients  with  BPDCN  had  CLS  reported  as  a  treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE). 
•  CLS was non-severe for 6 of these 9 patients, Grade 4 for 1 patient, and Grade 5 for 2 
patients (1 treated with 7 mcg/kg and 1 treated with 12 mcg/kg). 
•  The median time to onset of CLS was short (5 days), with most patients experiencing the first 
onset of CLS in Cycle 1 (no patient experienced the first onset of CLS after Cycle 2). 
•  After presentation, the median time to resolution of CLS was 4 days, with a maximum of 19 
days. 
•  Overall,  6  (67%)  of  the  9  patients  with  BPDCN  for  which  CLS  was  reported  as  a  TEAE  were 
treated beyond Cycle 1, none of whom experienced recurrence of CLS on continued treatment 
with tagraxofusp. 
In addition, 42 patients were treated in Stage 4 of the study (37 first-line and 5 R/R; all treated with 12 
mcg/kg), and data on CLS in this population were similar to the data obtained from the patients treated 
in Stages 1-3: 
•  Overall, 9 (21%) of 42 patients with BPDCN had CLS reported as a TEAE. 
•  CLS was non-severe for 5 of these 9 patients, Grade 4 for 1 patient, and Grade 5 for 1 
patient. 
•  The median time to onset of CLS was short (6 days), with most patients experiencing the first 
onset of CLS in Cycle 1 (no patient experienced the first onset of CLS after Cycle 2). 
Findings for CLS among all 176 patients with haematologic malignancies treated with ≤ 12 mcg/kg of 
tagraxofusp as monotherapy were similar to those in patients with BPDCN: 
•  Overall, 32 (18%) of 176 patients had CLS reported as a TEAE. 
•  Most CLS events were Grade 2 in intensity (22 of 32 patients). CLS was Grade 3 and Grade 
4 in intensity for 5 and 2 patients, respectively. Three cases of CLS were fatal (2%). 
To date, the incidence of CLS in patients with BPDCN treated with tagraxofusp in the commercial setting 
(19%)  was  similar  to  the  incidence  in  the  population  treated  with  Elzonris  as  monotherapy  (18%), 
suggesting  that  the  estimated  rate  of  CLS  in  patients  with  BPDCN  as  reported  in  Study  0114  is  an 
accurate estimation. Importantly most CLS cases were non-severe and resolved (69%), although 3 fatal 
cases occurred, all in Cycle 1 (after 2 to 5 doses of tagraxofusp). This included patient 06-007 a 64-year 
old male with AML who received a higher dose of tagraxofusp (16 μg/kg/day) than the to-be marketed 
dose. Although not definitive from the information available to the Sponsor, this patient may not have 
had adequate cardiac function prior to treatment start (LVEF 55%) and may have had increased weight 
gain that should have precluded the 3rd dose of tagraxofusp.

Management of CLS 
Following the first death reported as a result of CLS, the 0114 protocol was amended (Amendment 6, 01 
December  2014)  to  provide  risk  mitigation  strategies  for  CLS  including  modification  of  the  entrance 
criteria to require that patients have a normal LVEF before study entry and more rigorous monitoring of 
patients  during  the  infusion  period  (planned  for  5  consecutive  days)  in  each  cycle,  including  daily 
assessment  of  body  weight.  Guidance  around  albumin  levels  was  provided  including  levels  at  which 
albumin infusions are recommended and when dosing should be held; these mitigation strategies were 
further refined by Amendment 7 (11 August 2015) and also were incorporated into the protocols for all 
other tagraxofusp studies. The incidence of ≥Grade 3 CLS prior to implementation of these changes in 
the 0114 study was 17% (1/6 patients) and after implementation was 6% (7/119 patients). Furthermore, 
the rate of Grade 5 CLS in particular decreased from 17% (1/6) before implementation of these changes 
to 2% (2/119) after implementation, demonstrating the efficacy of these interventions. 
Collectively, the primary manifestations of CLS appear to occur early during treatment, and generally 
without recurrence in subsequent cycles. Early recognition and active mitigation of these symptoms as 
well as temporary tagraxofusp treatment interruptions resulted in resolution of CLS in the majority of 
patients.  Rapid  reduction  in  serum  albumin  is  the  hallmark  of  CLS  and  is  often  one  of  the  first 
abnormalities that present in the early stages of the syndrome. Oedema, weight gain and hypotension 
resulting from fluid overload are commonly observed in patients experiencing CLS. Therefore, the signs 
of CLS are simple to monitor in the clinic and when patients are at home. 
In clinical use, implementation of these precautions will be facilitated by patients being hospitalised and 
closely monitored for treatment in Cycle 1. 
The proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) includes advice on reducing the risk of severe 
CLS  and  optimising  the  management  of  patients  with  early  signs  of  this  toxicity.  These  measures 
comprise: 
•  Ensuring that the patient has adequate cardiac function and a serum albumin ≥ 3.2 g/dL before 
initiating therapy. 
•  Monitoring of serum albumin levels prior to each dose of tagraxofusp and maintaining albumin 
levels at ≥ 3.5 g/dL with intravenous albumin supplementation as required. 
•  Regular  assessment  for  other  signs  /  symptoms  of  CLS  including  weight  gain,  new  onset  or 
worsening oedema, hypotension and haemodynamic instability. 
•  Requirement for treatment interruptions if early signs of CLS develop and until these symptoms 
are resolved. 
Importantly, treatment interruption is a key component of the CLS risk minimisation guidelines and is 
recommended  as  part  of  early  intervention.  As  previously  mentioned,  the  proposed  guidelines  aim  to 
reduce the risk of serious CLS sequelae, and not prevent or reduce the overall incidence. 
The  proposed  patient  information  leaflet  includes  advice  for  patients  on  monitoring  symptoms  of  CLS 
once  they  are  discharged  from  the  hospital.  Per  the  proposed  risk  management  plan  patients  will  be 
counselled on the risk of CLS by their treating healthcare provider and will be given a patient alert card 
detailing the signs of CLS, what to do should they appear and who to contact. 
The  recommended  course  of  treatment  for  CLS  detailed  in  the  proposed  SmPC  (administration  of  IV 
albumin and/ or methylprednisolone [or equivalent], depending on severity of symptoms) follows current 
clinical guidance. 
The  overall  rate  of  CLS  (all  grades)  has  remained  consistent  between  clinical  trials  (20%  in  BPDCN 
patients  in  clinical  trials)  and  the  post-marketing/EAP  setting  (19%),  providing  evidence  that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 186/207 
 
 
  
  
 
established  risk  mitigation  measures  have  been  effective  (i.e.  the  incidence  of  CLS  in  the  real-world 
setting has not increased). The applicant has implemented risk minimization activities for the European 
EAP, and to date, there have been no deaths due to CLS reported in the 26 patients who have received 
or are currently receiving treatment through the EAP. 
• 
For  the  European  EAP,  as  sites  are  requesting  tagraxofusp  for  the  treatment  of  BPDCN,  the 
applicant  is  able  to  deliver  to  all  sites  (before  tagraxofusp  is  delivered)  an  extensive  training 
programme concerning early signs and symptoms of CLS, as well as dose modifications in case 
of abnormalities. 
Hepatotoxicity 
The exact mechanism of hepatoxicity with tagraxofusp is unknown, although it is likely to be related to 
a direct effect on the hepatocyte related to higher exposure to tagraxofusp in Cycle 1 of treatment and 
not to immune-complex formation based on the early onset of these events, noted recovery, and lack of 
recurrence.  
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased were the most common 
TEAEs overall. 
Among the 47 patients with BPDCN treated with tagraxofusp in Stages 1-3, 31 (66%) experienced ALT 
increased and/or AST increased. Grade ≥3 reports of TEAEs of ALT and AST increased occurred in 17 
(36%) and 16 (34%) patients, respectively. Findings were similar in the 42 patients treated in Stage 4: 
28 (67%) of 42 experienced ALT increased and/or AST increased. Grade ≥3 reports of TEAEs of ALT and 
AST increased occurred in 11 (26%) patients each.  
Overall, most patients who experienced ALT increased and AST increased did so in the first cycle. An 
assessment of time to first onset of increases in ALT or AST based on laboratory data (to > 3×ULN), was 
consistent  with  these  results,  with  most  increases  occurring  within  the  first  treatment  cycle.  The 
incidences of liver enzymes increases in patients with BPDCN (~66%) were similar to the incidence in 
the  population  treated  with  Elzonris  as  monotherapy  (~55%),  suggesting  that  the  estimated  rate  of 
hepatotoxicity in patients with BPDCN as reported in study 0114 is an accurate estimation. 
Acute  hepatic  failure  and  liver  encephalopathy  was  reported  in  one  patient  treated  with  Elzonris  at  a 
higher dose (16 mcg/kg). Two first-line BPDCN patients in the 0114 study met the laboratory criteria for 
Hy’s Law, 1 based on the ALT and bilirubin criteria (Patient 02-026), and 1 based on AST and bilirubin 
criteria (Patient 06-001). In both patients, the LFT elevations occurred early in the patient’s treatment 
course  (Cycle  1).  One  of  the  patients  (06-001)  had  concurrent  severe  CLS,  which  led  to  multiorgan 
failure  (acute  kidney  injury,  respiratory  failure,  as  well  as  the  significant  elevations  in  LFTs)  and  the 
patient’s death. The other patient continued to receive tagraxofusp following recovery of the LFT levels 
without  further  elevations  reported.  Both  patients  were  receiving  other  confounding  medications  that 
could have led to elevations in LFTs, including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
levofloxacin, and statins. Based on the Sponsor’s review of these cases, neither case was considered by 
the Sponsor to represent drug-induced liver injury. However, information on these cases was added to 
the proposed SmPC. 
To date, the totality of the safety data to date pertaining to hepatotoxicity support the position that drug-
induced liver injury is not expected with tagraxofusp. 
In terms of risk mitigation, management and monitoring, patients with severe hepatic impairment who 
may present an increased risk for hepatoxicity should not be treated with tagraxofusp according to the 
proposed SmPC which requires that serum albumin be > 3.2 g/dL.

The SmPC also advises that AST and ALT be measured before each dose and that if transaminases rise 
to  greater  than  5  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal  treatment  should  be  withheld  until  transaminase 
elevations are ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. 
Post-authorisation, the applicant proposes to collect data on hepatic events via a follow-up form as part 
of routine pharmacovigilance, as well as on hepatotoxicity via the proposed clinical PASS. 
Choroid plexus lesions 
Although nonclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicology studies did not assess whether tagraxofusp entered 
the  CNS,  clinical  neurological  findings  in  those  studies  were  normal  and  the  only  notable  CNS 
histopathological finding was that observed in the choroid. 
Changes  in  the  choroid  plexus  are  of  unknown  relevance  to  humans.  However,  to  monitor  for  this 
potential toxicity in the clinic, assessments for headaches and neurological  signs and symptoms were 
required  in  Investigator-sponsored  Study  50047  among  the  patients  treated  with  Regimen  A  (dosing 
every  other  day  for  up  to  6  doses).  There  were  no  clinical  findings  consistent  with  this  toxicity. 
Consequently, this monitoring was removed from the protocol for Regimen B (daily dosing × 5) and was 
not employed in Stemline-sponsored studies. No findings consistent with this toxicity were seen among 
the  46  patients  treated  with  Regimen  B  in  study  50047.  In  the  SCS  pool,  there  was  no  documented 
evidence suggestive of choroid plexitis on neuroimaging in any of the nervous system disorder serious 
treatment related cases. Additionally, there were no serious nor severe adverse reactions suggestive of 
idiopathic raised intracranial pressures in the 141 patients included in the SCS. 3 patients in the SCS 
pool  had  Grade  5  Nervous  System  Disorders,  including  1  patient  each  with  AML,  advanced  systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), and MPN. None of the patients with BPDCN had a Grade 5 Nervous System Disorder. 
Two  of  the  patients  received  the  12  μg/kg/day  dose  of  tagraxofusp  and  1  received  the  16  μg/kg/day 
dose. Two of the events leading to death were assessed as unrelated to study treatment (haemorrhage 
intracranial and cerebral infarction) and 1 (cerebrovascular accident) was assessed as treatment related 
by the Investigator. Based on Sponsor review of these cases there was no evidence suggesting choroid 
plexitis. No neurological events occurred on study 0114 in BPDCN patients that are considered related 
to choroid plexus deposits.  
Information  on  the  non-clinical  findings  are  included  in  the  proposed  SmPC  with  full  neurological 
examination advised if clinical signs or symptoms of CNS damage should be observed. 
To further assess the mechanism of the choroid plexus findings in the non-clinical studies, the applicant 
will be conducting a category 3 PASS which will employ immunohistochemistry staining of brain tissue 
samples from non-clinical study MPI 2231 007 with the aim of determining potential toxicity biomarkers. 
Conclusion 
Acceptable safety has been demonstrated in a sizeable dataset (up to June 2019) of 176 patients treated 
with  monotherapy  in  clinical  trials  and  an  additional  128  patients  treated  in  the  post-marketing/EAP 
setting. Importantly, the post-marketing/EAP experience is thus far consistent with the adverse events 
seen in the clinical trials, especially with regard to CLS, the incidence of which has not increased in the 
real-world setting, supporting the effectiveness of the risk minimisation strategies described above. The 
applicant has implemented risk minimization activities for the European EAP, and to date, there have 
been  no  deaths  due  to  CLS  reported  in  the  26  patients  who  have  received  or  are  currently  receiving 
treatment through the EAP. 
It is also important to note that as CLS is a known adverse reaction associated with other anti-neoplastic 
therapies, treating oncologists are familiar with recognising and treating CLS. 
The toxicity profile is well characterized and acceptable when considered against the benefits of the drug.  
Uncertainties will be monitored further in the post-marketing setting, in particular through the proposed

PASS  described  earlier,  and  adequate  risk  minimization  procedures  are  in  place  to  reduce  risks  to 
patients. 
Ground for refusal number 4 
Therefore, taking into account these concerns in the context of a limited and heterogenous dataset, 
the CHMP cannot conclude that efficacy has been robustly shown. Together with the uncertainties on 
the safety profile, B/R cannot be established. 
Ground for re-examination number 4 
BPDCN  is  an  aggressive  malignancy  with  a  short  survival  time.  The  principal  goal  of  any  therapeutic 
intervention in BPDCN is the achievement of a complete response, from which the relapse-free period 
can be extended through continued consolidation therapy with or without subsequent transplantation. 
There  are  no  approved  and  no  satisfactory  treatment  options  for  induction  of  remission.  Combination 
chemotherapy  regimens  used  in  current  practice  are  not  well-documented,  leading  the  Leukemia  and 
Lymphoma Society 2018 to conclude “Due to the aggressive clinical course of BPDCN and its historically 
poor  outcome  with  conventional  chemotherapy,  referral  to  a  clinical  trial  either  at  diagnosis  or  after 
relapse should be considered for all patients, if available.” What is well recognised is the substantial and 
prolonged  toxicities  and  the  risk  of  treatment-related  death  (17%-26%)  associated  with  available 
chemotherapy  regimens.    Hence,  there  is  a  clear  medical  need  for  new  therapies.    Tagraxofusp  is 
targeted  treatment,  developed  based  on  the  disease  biology  that  the  BPDCN  malignancy  arises  from 
proliferation of malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that ubiquitously express high levels of the 
cell surface antigen CD123. 
Study 0114 was a prospective study of tagraxofusp in patients with the same demographic and clinical 
characteristics as patients who present in clinical practice.  The study used complete response (CR/CRc) 
criteria, developed in collaboration with medical experts in BPDCN (see Response to Ground 1) which 
are more stringent than those applied in the retrospective reviews.  A complete response in an individual 
patient can be attributed entirely to a treatment effect of tagraxofusp because spontaneous remission of 
BPDCN does not occur (see Response to Ground 3).  Hence, the response criteria enabled the robust 
demonstration of the treatment effect of tagraxofusp, with 47% (95% CI, 32.5%, 61.7%) of first-line 
patients in Stages 3-4 and 57% (95% CI, 44.0%, 69.2%) over Stages 1-4 achieving complete response.  
BPDCN is an ultra-rare disease.  Nevertheless, the size of study 0114 is adequate to estimate the effects 
of treatment with sufficient precision to enable a benefit-risk assessment, with a lower bound of the 95% 
CI  of  32.5%  in  Stages 3  and  4  and  44.0%  for  the  pooled  4  stages  of  the  trial.    Some  differences  in 
complete response rates across trial stages were observed but, critically, a relevant magnitude of effect 
is  established  in  each  stage  of  the  trial  and  in  pooled  analyses,  whether  including  patients  recruited 
across all trial stages or restricted to patients recruited during and after the confirmatory stage 3.   
Complete response rates in elderly patients were found to be similar to those in middle-aged or younger 
patients. This is of note because elderly patients often do not tolerate the alternative currently available 
intensive chemotherapy regimens used to induce remission.  
SCT  is  a  therapeutic  option  for  some  BPDCN  patients  following  treatment-induced  disease  remission.  
Whilst  SCT  use  complicates  an  estimation  of  the  duration  of  tagraxofusp-induced  response,  complete 
responses  in  tagraxofusp  treated  patients  were  of  sufficient  duration  to  enable  one  third  of  patients 
(32.3%) to bridge to SCT, extending the duration of the benefit derived from treatment. Patients who 
achieved  CR/CRc  but  did  not  bridge  to  SCT  also  derived  benefit  from  tagraxofusp,  as  evidenced  by 
prolonged responses of >6 months and of longer duration, up to 35+ months, in 4 patients.

R/R BPDCN is known to arise by the same biological mechanism as newly diagnosed disease, involving 
the proliferation of malignant pDCs that ubiquitously express high levels of CD123.  Consistent with the 
disease biology, and the targeted nature of tagraxofusp, CRs and PRs were observed in patients with 
R/R disease.  Patients with R/R BPDCN have extremely poor prognosis and, as with all recurrent oncologic 
disease, become increasingly resistant over successive courses of chemotherapy.  As such, tagraxofusp 
remains a medically relevant therapeutic option in R/R patients.  
Considering  the  life-threatening  and  aggressive  nature  of  BPDCN,  tagraxofusp  has  demonstrated  an 
acceptable safety profile, data is provided from 176 patients treated with monotherapy in clinical trials 
and  an  additional  128  patients  treated  in  the  post-marketing  setting  in  the  US  and  an  early  access 
programme in Europe.  Overall, the size of the safety database is considered appropriate to characterise 
the safety profile of tagraxofusp in the target population, given this is an ultra-rare disease.  Of the 176 
patients  included  in  the  monotherapy  studies  treated  with  tagraxofusp  ≤ 12 mcg/kg,  89  were  BPDCN 
patients treated in Stages 1-4 of study 0114. In addition to the pivotal study 0114 in BPDCN patients, 
safety data from 3 other applicant-sponsored studies of tagraxofusp, in haematologic malignancies other 
than  BPDCN  were  included.  The  safety  profile  of  tagraxofusp  was  largely  similar  in  patients  with 
haematological malignancies across the studied indications (mainly BPDCN and AML, with few patients 
included with diagnoses of other haematological neoplasms). These safety results show both consistency 
and an acceptable safety profile. 
Most adverse events were transient and manageable, with few leading to treatment discontinuation, and 
adverse events did not accumulate over cycles of therapy.   A particular benefit of tagraxofusp is that 
the  treatment  does  not  require  prolonged  hospitalization  as  the  treatment  is  given  as  an  intravenous 
infusion over 15 minutes, once daily, on days 1-5 of a 21-day cycle, with only the first cycle required to 
be  administered  in  the  in-patient  setting.  Furthermore,  prolonged  myelosuppression  has  not  been 
observed with tagraxofusp. 
The incidence of common TEAEs was notably lower after Cycle 2. This decrease in incidence was noted 
for most TEAEs. The incidences of individual TEAEs leading to discontinuation of tagraxofusp were low, 
indicating  they  were  manageable.  The  safety  profile  was  similar  across  older  patients  compared  with 
middle-aged and younger patients. 
Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) is the most important identified risk. It is important to note that as CLS 
is  a  known  adverse  reaction  associated  with  other  anti-neoplastic  therapies,  treating  oncologists  are 
familiar with recognising and treating it. 
Findings  for  CLS  among  all  176  patients  with haematologic malignancies  treated  with  ≤  12  mcg/kg 
of tagraxofusp as monotherapy were similar to those in patients with BPDCN:  Overall, 32 (18%) of 176 
patients had CLS reported as a TEAE. Most CLS events were Grade 2 in intensity (22 of 32 patients). CLS 
was Grade 3 and Grade 4 in intensity for 5 and 2 patients, respectively. Three cases of CLS were fatal 
(2%). To date, the incidence of CLS in patients with BPDCN treated with tagraxofusp in the commercial 
setting (19%) was similar to the incidence in the population treated with Elzonris as monotherapy (18%) 
suggesting  that  the  rate  of  CLS  in  patients  with  BPDCN  as  reported  in  study  0114  is  an  accurate 
estimation. Importantly, most CLS cases were non-severe and resolved (69%), although 3 fatal cases 
occurred, all in Cycle 1 (after 2 to 5 doses of tagraxofusp).  
Since  CLS  is  characterized  by  readily  recognizable  symptoms  and  laboratory  abnormalities,  risk 
minimization guidelines were implemented in the clinical trial and are proposed in the RMP. The proposed 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  together  with  the  proposed  RMP  duly  includes  advice  on 
reducing  the  risk  of  severe  CLS  and  optimising  the  management  of  patients  with  early  signs  of  this 
toxicity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 190/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Importantly,  the  post-marketing  US/EAP  in  Europe  experience  is  thus  far  consistent  with  the  adverse 
events seen in the clinical trials, with no new safety signals identified, especially with regard to CLS. The 
applicant has implemented risk minimization activities for the EAP in Europe, and to date, there have 
been  no  deaths  due  to  CLS  reported  in  the  26  patients  who  have  received  or  are  currently  receiving 
treatment through this programme.  
In  conclusion,  the  toxicity  profile  is well  characterized  and  acceptable  when  considered  against  the 
benefits of the drug, and in the therapeutic context. The applicant recognises that uncertainties exist in 
all regulatory decisions, and in particular for medicines that are developed in rare diseases.  The design 
of  a  PASS  has  been  agreed  to  increase  the  extent  of  safety  data  available  and  to  demonstrate  the 
effectiveness of risk minimisation measures in EU clinical practice.  The applicant also plans to continue 
to generate clinical data and increase the knowledge around the efficacy and safety of tagraxofusp in 
other haematologic malignancies, as monotherapy and in combination with other treatments.  Should 
the  CHMP  find  the  benefit-risk  of  tagraxofusp  to  be  positive,  but  would  like  to  link  approval  to  the 
generation and submission of post-authorization data, the applicant would welcome a discussion on how 
to refine or develop the post-authorization evidence generation.  
Concluding: 
• 
Tagraxofusp  targets  CD123;  a  rationale  therapeutic  target  for  BPDCN.    Tagraxofusp  induced 
clinically meaningful complete responses in a representative population of patients with BPDCN. 
•  Adverse  events  of  tagraxofusp  were  typically  transient  and  did  not  accumulate  over  cycles  of 
therapy.    Tagraxofusp  is  not  associated  with  prolonged  myelosuppression.    Risk  minimisation 
strategies for CLS are proving effective based on, on-market experience in US as well patients 
treated within the EU EAP. 
• 
The  benefit  of  inducing  CR/CRc  in  over  50%  of  treated  patients  and  enabling  SCT  in  32%  of 
patients  outweigh  the  adverse  event  profile,  in  particular  considering  the  current  absence  of 
satisfactory treatment options.   
Thus, the benefit-risk of tagraxofusp in BPDCN is positive.  
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened a 
Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) inviting the experts to provide their views on the CHMP grounds for 
refusal, taking into account the applicant’s response.  
Report from the SAG 
The SAG is expected to comment on the CHMP grounds for refusal: 
In the context of a one-pivotal-trial scenario, the evidence in support of the claimed indication of 
tagraxofusp as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell 
neoplasm (BPDCN) is considered insufficient: 
•  The pivotal 4 cohort phase I/II study has important limitations rendering the benefit of 
tagraxofusp not robustly demonstrated in the context of a single pivotal trial with a non-
randomised design and a small sample size. A total of 84 BPDCN patients (n=65 first line and 
n=19 second line) have been enrolled.  
•  Statistical analysis was only planned for cohort 3 of the study in which a total of 13 first line 
patients were enrolled. Study 0114 was thus not designed to detect a particular magnitude of 
effect in the BPDCN population as studied.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 191/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Pivotal efficacy results showed an anti-disease activity in cohort 3 with a complete response 
rate (CR/CRc) of 53.8%. However: 
i) The magnitude of the efficacy response was highly heterogeneous across the 4 stages; 
ii) It is not clear why CR rate and HSCT decreased over time in the successive cohorts; 
iii) The activity seen in second line are unlikely to represent benefit for the second line population; 
iv) The safety profile is not well characterized. 
•  Therefore, taking into account these concerns in the context of a limited and heterogenous 
dataset, the CHMP cannot conclude that efficacy has been robustly shown. Together with the 
uncertainties on the safety profile, B/R cannot be established. 
The SAG discussed the therapeutic context of treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid 
dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). The SAG agreed that this is a very challenging clinical and research 
setting due to the rarity of the disease (even larger centres would see only 1-2 patients a year), the 
highly aggressive natural history of this multi-organ systemic disease (8 to 14 months in first-line 
setting with standard chemotherapy regimens also in patients with “skin-only” disease), and the high 
incidence in elderly patients that often cannot tolerate induction chemotherapy followed by stem cell 
transplantation. Currently, there is no agreement as to what type of chemotherapy should be used in 
these patients. Among the SAG experts, some prefer AML-type regimens, while others ALL or NHL-type 
type regimens without sufficient long-lasting remissions except in selected patients achieving 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). There is no prospective comparison or even assessment of 
these regimens. Also that none of these chemotherapy regimens has ever been assessed 
prospectively. In this high unmet need situation, prospective evaluation of current practices and of 
further active treatments are urgently needed.  
Tagraxofusp is a targeted agent against CD123 that is highly expressed in BPDCN. Thus, there is a 
sound biological rational for tagraxofusp in this disease and this is supported by available in vitro and 
in vivo studies. 
The SAG discussed in detail the available evidence and considerations presented by the rapporteurs 
and the applicant. In general, the SAG agreed that efficacy has been demonstrated on the basis of 
complete response (CR), successful achievement of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), and 
durable remissions. The ability of patients to achieve CR, a prerequisite for ASCT, is remarkable 
considering that ASCT was not considered suitable for patients entering the trial. Allowing patients to 
proceed to ASCT, which is the only option with curative potential and long-lasting remissions, is a clear 
clinical benefit in this high unmet need situation. Some SAG members also highlighted that relapse is 
relatively common even after ASCT, which was not the case, apparently, in this trial. 
The SAG agreed that precise efficacy data are not available, and that patient selection may have led to 
overestimate the true effect on CR. The heterogeneity observed in the various cohorts of the trial 
determines a rather wide uncertainty around the true estimate. However, the existence of an 
important effect associated with tagraxofusp in terms of patients achieving CRs, undergoing successful 
ASCT, and achieving long-term remissions, is clearly shown taking into account the predictable natural 
history of the disease and the range of effects that have been described in small retrospective series 
with intensive chemotherapy treatment options that are considered standard in this setting. The SAG 
was in agreement that clinically relevant efficacy has been demonstrated. There are not enough data 
to demonstrate its curative potential as monotherapy or duration of response and survival in patients 
who did not undergo ASCT after having achieved a CR. However, tagraxofusp may be potentially 
curative for some patients which are consolidated with ASCT.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 192/207 
 
 
  
  
 
Although there was general agreement that a clinical benefit has been established some members 
regretted that lack of a randomized controlled trial did not allow a robust comparison to available 
intensive chemotherapy regimens. However, the majority of SAG members considered that RCTs, 
although theoretically possible, would have been extremely challenging due to the rarity of the disease 
and acknowledged that study 0114 is the only prospective trial with pre-specified response criteria 
performed in this rare disease. Some SAG members noted that in the post marketing setting, more 
than 120 patients have been treated with tagraxofusp within a rather short time suggesting that a 
small randomized trial vs. physician’s choice would have been possible despite the rarity of this 
disease. Others, however, noted that many centres would have to be opened to achieve even a small 
sample size and that this is not realistic given that most centres will not open a clinical trial when they 
expect to include only 1-2 patients/year. Nevertheless, the SAG agreed that it would be important to 
generate more efficacy and safety data to refine the understanding of benefits and harms in a broader 
population to optimise patient selection and treatment decisions.  
It was also noted that the definition of CR in the trial was unusual, since it required the conventional 
normalization of peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymphadenopathy but allowed for “residual 
hyperpigmentation or abnormality with BPDCN identified on biopsy (or no biopsy performed)”. 
Although a skin biopsy showing residual tumour cells may not be critical in the decision of undergoing 
ASCT, assessment of the success of this procedure depending on microscopic residual skin disease 
could be further explored. 
The SAG also agreed that toxicity was clinically significant but manageable and that there is a high 
unmet need for less toxic options compared to intensive chemotherapy. Based on the available data, 
the overall toxicity profile tagraxofusp compares favourably to available options. The better safety 
profile associated with tagraxofusp may be important also in ensuring that patients can successfully 
undergo ASCT.  
Although some SAG members expressed some concerns about the high incidence of capillary leak 
syndrome (CLS) and 11% deaths that occurred within 30 days of last tagraxofusp dose in the clinical 
studies (n=21/190 all dose, monotherapy; see rapporteur report)  even in experienced haematological 
centres, in general, the safety profile compared to intensive chemotherapy was considered a major 
advantage compared to the most active available treatments. 
In conclusion, notwithstanding all the methodological weaknesses, potential selection bias, and need 
for a more precise understanding of benefits and harms in a wider population, the SAG agreed that 
benefit has been established and that the toxicity profile is acceptable.  
From a clinical perspective this additional therapeutic option is welcome in this very rare disease and 
high unmet need situation. The SAG agreed that it is important to manage the toxicity using adequate 
risk minimisation measures and to acknowledge uncertainties on the precise benefits associated with 
tagraxofusp until more precise data become available. Many other clinical questions remain open and 
hence the need for optimising treatment post-approval. For instance, according to some experts, 
tagraxofusp could become an important treatment for younger and fitter patients to minimise the risks 
of hampering ASCT with the toxicity associated with intensive chemotherapy (neutropenia, sepsis, 
etc.) Others thought that intensive chemotherapy should be the preferred option in fit patients and this 
treatment may be more interesting for elderly and frail patients, to avoid the toxicity of intensive 
chemotherapy that should be the preferred options in fit patients, although the data in the pivotal 
study were more representative of a fit population (ECOG PS mainly 0-1). Lastly, risk factors for 
capillary leak syndrome and other severe toxicity should be studied further. Clearly, more data will be 
needed to better define the treatments of choice in this disease. 
Concerning the grounds for refusal,

• 
The SAG did not support the conclusion that the evidence is considered insufficient to support 
the claimed indication, except perhaps in the second-line setting especially taken the toxicity 
into consideration. Only very few patients in the study received tagraxofusp as second-line 
treatment and only very short response durations were observed. These aspects should be 
carefully considered if extrapolation from first-line is attempted, although the SAG 
acknowledged that it is extremely challenging to conduct separate studies in this even rarer 
and higher unmet need population. 
• 
The known methodological limitations associated with single-arm trials, pooling of cohorts 
within exploratory trials, and heterogeneity observed in the different cohorts and over time, do 
not per se invalidate the clinical benefit observed in many patients. It is important to 
remember that available therapeutic options also have huge uncertainties and heterogeneity 
observed across series (with no general agreement regarding which is the best treatment for 
this condition). The basis of evidence is considered limited but not unusual or insufficient in 
these settings when the effect of the drug is clear and there are no alternatives proven to be 
associated with a clearly better efficacy or safety profile, or fewer uncertainties. 
• 
• 
The SAG considered that the beneficial effect observed in some patients is clinically relevant 
and can be attributed to tagraxofusp (despite remaining uncertainties about the precise 
magnitude of effect in a broader population). 
The SAG considered that the safety profile is sufficiently well characterised to allow informed 
clinical decisions and an assessment of the balance of benefits and harms in the clinical setting. 
Furthermore, the SAG agreed that the toxicity profile was undoubtedly more favourable 
compared to that associated with standard intensive chemotherapy. This also could be relevant 
for elderly and frail patients due to poor tolerability, or when, due to toxicity, there may be a 
risk of hampering subsequent ASCT. 
Post-authorisation data should be collected to optimise the understanding of efficacy and 
safety in a broader population. 
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant and considered the views of the Scientific Advisory Group.  
The CHMP considered that blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), is a rare 
haematological disorder with approximately 700 and 1000 incident cases annually in the US and 
Europe, respectively. The prognosis is poor, with median duration of overall survival after diagnosis 
reported at 9-13 months unless patients can undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), 
associated with median duration of overall survival of 30 months or longer.  
Eligibility for SCT requires induction treatment to achieve a complete response (CR), a prerequisite for 
a successful procedure. There are no medicines specifically authorised for the treatment of BPDCN. 
However, a variety of approaches are currently used successfully to treat patients with treatment-naïve 
BPDCN using acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), or non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL)-like intensive chemotherapy regimens, with the aim of inducing CR to allow 
subsequent ASCT.  The efficacy of these therapies is ill-documented (including the lack of a standard 
definition of CR). CR rates in the range of 10% to 60% have been observed using variable regimens in 
small retrospective series. Such regimens are associated with high toxicity including treatment-related 
mortality in the range of 17% to 26%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 194/207 
 
 
  
  
 
The pivotal study 0114 was the first prospective clinical trial in BPDCN. This was a multi cohort single-
arm trial (SAT) conducted over 6 years. The primary outcome was considered relevant to capture 
clinical benefit insofar as it allowed bridging to SCT. Although a randomized comparison of efficacy and 
safety to currently used regimen would have been useful to contextualise the effects, the effects on CR 
observed in the single-arm trial can be convincingly attributed to tagraxofusp as spontaneous 
remissions can be excluded based on the known natural history of the disease. Furthermore, the 
observed results in terms of successful SCT and long survival in some patients confirm the favourable 
effect of the CRs associated with tagraxofusp. Some heterogeneity of CR and the proportion of patients 
undergoing successful SCT across the respective “stages” of the pivotal trial can be expected given the 
small size of the trial. 
Considering also the SAG advice on the clinical relevance of the observed results and the challenges of 
conducting randomized controlled trials in this rare population, the CHMP concluded that efficacy has 
been demonstrated in first-line treatment of BPDCN. However, the dataset in the treatment of relapsed 
or refractory (2nd-line) BPDCN is too small to draw any conclusions.  
Safety results of tagraxofusp in BPDCN population are mainly coming from the study STML-401-0114 
(study 0114); additional safety data also included data from studies 0214 (for adverse risk AML), 0314 
(for advanced high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasms) and 0414 (for relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma), using a variety of doses. The safety profile of tagrasofusp is non-trivial, including 
hepatotoxicity and potentially lethal capillary leak syndrome. However, the overall treatment-
associated mortality is not higher than what has been reported with intensive chemotherapy. The 
proposed SmPC provides risk mitigation advice for the key toxicities. The educational programme for 
the healthcare professionals to enhance the awareness of the early signs and symptoms of capillary 
leak syndrome (CLS) together with the patient card were considered adequate to minimise this risk. 
Also considering the SAG advice, the CHMP concluded that the safety profile was considered 
manageable and acceptable in this therapeutic context. 
Therefore, based on the totality of the data, the grounds for re-examination and the advice from the 
SAG, the CHMP concluded that: 
• 
• 
The efficacy demonstrated in a small SAT in this rare, aggressive disorder with no approved 
treatment alternatives, is considered relevant. The side effect profile is non-trivial but 
acceptable in the context.  
The benefits in previously untreated patients outweigh the risks. Benefit in the relapsed or 
refractory setting has not been established and the indication should therefore be restricted to 
1st-line treatment only.  
Due to the lack of a randomised control group, drug effects on overall survival cannot be isolated. 
Furthermore, patient selection may result in over-estimation of the treatment effect. Lastly, refining 
the understanding of benefits and harms based on patient, treatment and disease characteristics is not 
possible in such small populations. Given the challenges of conducting randomized controlled trials in 
this disease and the many available treatment options, direct comparisons are difficult to obtain, 
comprehensive data are not anticipated to be generated and some considerable level of uncertainty is 
likely to persist on these aspects.  
The applicant agreed to the proposed indication. 
The CHMP agreed that the applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and 
safety under normal conditions of use because the indication is too rare. Therefore, the CHMP 
recommended that a marketing authorisation under “exceptional circumstances” be granted due to the 
rarity of the disease. In this context, the applicant is required to submit the results from an

observational study (e.g., using a registry) of sufficient size and duration to study these aspects, 
including planned comparative matched analyses using relevant external controls.

7.  Benefit-risk balance following re-examination 
7.1.  Therapeutic Context 
7.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Prevalence 
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), is a rare haematological disorder derived from 
the precursor of plasmacytoid dendritic cells currently categorized under acute myeloid leukaemia and 
related precursor neoplasms in the 2008 WHO classification.  
The prevalence estimate for BPDCN, in line with the information presented for the EU orphan 
designation application, is 1.2 per 10,000. BPDCN may constitute approximately 0.44% of 
haematologic cancers annually, or approximately 700 and 1000 incident cases annually in the US and 
Europe, respectively. 
Prognosis and management 
The disease has a proclivity to involve the skin, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Prognosis is miserable 
unless patients can be bridged to stem cell transplantation (SCT), with median OS after diagnosis 
reported at 9-13 months. Bridging to SCT involves treating patients with combination chemotherapy to 
induce a complete response (CR) prior to the procedure. 
7.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are no medicines specifically authorised for the treatment of BPDCN and no standard of care 
treatment has been established for patients with newly diagnosed (first-line) or previously treated 
(relapsed/refractory) disease.  
Therapies historically employed to treat patients with treatment-naïve BPDCN include versions of 
those, used for aggressive haematologic malignancies, including CHOP or CHOP-like; cytarabine plus 
an anthracycline; or hyper-CVAD alternating with methotrexate, and cytarabine. 
The efficacy of these therapies is ill-documented (including the lack of a standard definition of CR). 
Furthermore, they exhibit substantial toxicity, with treatment associated mortality of 17-26% reported 
in retrospective case series (Pagano et al 2013; Martin-Martin et al 2015). 
Thus, there is an unmet medical need in BPDCN. 
7.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
7.2.  Favourable effects 
The pivotal study 0114 was the first prospective clinical trial in BPDCN. This was a multi cohort single-
arm trial (SAT) conducted over 6 years. Cohorts or “stage” 1,2 and 4 included both previously 
untreated as well as relapsed/refractory patients with BPDCN and other haematological malignancies, 
namely acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Cohort 3 was identified as pivotal by the applicant. It recruited 
only patients with first-line BPDCN. Its objective was to evaluate efficacy and safety supporting the 
indication for the treatment of adult patients with first-line BPDCN.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 199/207 
 
 
  
  
 
The sample size for stage 3 was calculated to provide at least 90% power at a two-sided Type I error 
rate of 0.05 to reject a null hypothesis that the rate of complete response (CR+CRc) was ≤ 10%, if the 
true rate was 60%. This success criterion was not agreed with EU regulators. The study 0114 was not 
sized to detect a particular magnitude of an effect for R/R BPDCN population. 
CR is defined as complete resolution of the disease. CRc is defined similarly but allows for residual 
hyperpigmentation or histological abnormality in the skin. Neither CR nor CRc is anticipated to occur 
spontaneously in the absence of therapy. Therefore, the SAT design is sufficient to isolate drug effects.  
The primary outcome is considered to capture clinical benefit insofar as it allows bridging to SCT. 
A total of 84 patients with BPDCN (65 first-line and 19 R/R) were treated with 12 mg/kg and evaluated 
for efficacy in the 4 stages of Study 0114. At study entry, none of the patients with BPDCN were 
considered eligible for immediate SCT because they had active disease and were therefore in need of a 
treatment that could potentially induce complete remission prior to being considered for SCT-
conditioning. 
Complete Response for the pivotal Stage 3 (N=13) was CR/CRc = 7 (53.8%), [95% CI (25.1, 80.8)].  
The overall CR rate (n=65) was 57%; 95% CI (44-69). The overall rate of bridging to SCT was 32%; 
95% CI (21-45). 
Duration of response was fundamentally a function of whether patients were bridged to SCT or not. 
44.8% (13/29) patients were bridged to SCT with 10 patients of 13 (77%) alive and still in response as 
of the updated time-to event analysis. In patients not bridged to SCT (n=9+9) median DoR was 3.7 
months in stages 1-3 and 2.7 months in stage 4. Similarly, OS was mainly a function of bridging to 
SCT. 
In patients with R/R BPDCN, the CR rate was 3/19. One patient was bridged to SCT. 
7.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the nature of the pivotal study ( SAT), and the absence of a randomised control group, drug 
effects on OS cannot be isolated. 
Since the success criteria of the prospective hypothesis test designed for the Stage 3 cohort cannot be 
agreed with regard to clinical relevance, the pivotal study is essentially viewed as an extended case 
series. The variable outcomes between the different subcohorts makes the precise effect estimate 
uncertain. 
Except for the primary endpoint in Stage 3, the applicant has not defined endpoints in the different 
subgroups including the R/R population. The dataset in the R/R BPDCN is so small that the drug effect 
cannot be reliably quantified. 
7.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The total size of the safety dataset assessed by the CHMP in the original MAA evaluation, is given as 
239 patients. Safety results of tagraxofusp in BPDCN population are mainly coming from the study 
STML-401-0114 (study 0114). However, the Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) pool also included data 
from studies 0214 (for adverse risk AML), 0314 (for advanced high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasms) 
and 0414 (for R/R multiple myeloma).  
113 patients received tagraxofusp at the intended dose (12 mcg/kg). Overall, 96 patients were 
enrolled in the study 0114; 47 BPDCN (32 first line and 15 R/R) and 49 AML patients. From these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 200/207 
 
 
  
  
 
 
BPDCN patients, 3 first line BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 7 µg/kg/day, 29 first line BPDCN 
patients received tagraxofusp at 12 µg/kg/day, and 15 R/R BPDCN patients received tagraxofusp at 12 
µg/kg/day. 
According to data provided from study 0114, median duration of exposure to tagraxofusp was 96 days 
(approximately 3.2 months) and 48 days (approximately 1.6 months) for first-line and R/R BPDCN, 
respectively. The median number of started cycles were 5.0 cycles and 3.0 cycles for first-line and R/R 
BPDCN, respectively. 
TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation was reported in 2% (1/47). Overall, 68.1% of all the BPDCN 
patients reported any TEAE leading to dose interruption and 2.1% reported any TEAE leading to dose 
reduction. 
The most common TEAE regardless of grade were ALT increased (63.8%), AST increased (59.6%), 
hypoalbuminaemia (55.3%), oedema peripheral (51.1%) and thrombocytopenia (48.9%), fatigue 
(44.7%), pyrexia (44.7%), nausea (46.8%), weight increased (38.3%), hyperglycaemia (36.2%), 
chills (34.0%), hypotension (27.7%), headache (25.5%), decrease appetite (25.5%), back pain 
(25.5%), anaemia (23.4%), constipation (23.4%), hypocalcaemia (23.4%), hypokalaemia (21.3%) 
and hypertension (21.3%). 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported at least once for 80.9% (38/47) of the total of the BPDCN patients. The 
most common ≥Grade 3 TEAEs reported were thrombocytopenia (31.2%), ALT increased (24.8%), AST 
increased (24.1%) and anaemia (19.9%). Results were similar for the patients of the SCS pool. 
SAEs were reported at least once in 48.9% (23/47) of the BPDCN patients. The most common reported 
TESAEs were Capillary leak syndrome (8.5%), pyrexia (6.4%), AST increased (4.3%) and hypertension 
(4.3%). 
TEAEs leading to death were reported in 6.4% of patients. 
Within the safety reporting period of 30 days after the last dose of tagraxofusp in the applicant-
sponsored studies, 11% of patients died. 
The most significant AESI is capillary leak syndrome (CLS). Findings for CLS among all 176 patients 
with haematologic malignancies treated with ≤ 12 mcg/kg of tagraxofusp as monotherapy were similar 
to those in patients with BPDCN:  
Overall, 32 (18%) of 176 patients had CLS reported as a TEAE. Most CLS events were Grade 2 in 
intensity (22 of 32 patients). CLS was Grade 3 and Grade 4 in intensity for 5 and 2 patients, 
respectively. Three cases of CLS were fatal (2%).  
The proposed Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) includes advice on reducing the risk of 
severe CLS and optimising the management of patients with early signs of this toxicity. The 
educational programme for the healthcare professionals to enhance the awareness of the early signs 
and symptoms of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) together with the patient card are considered 
adequate to minimise this risk.  
7.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
All safety data come from SAT’s. Therefore, drug effects cannot be reliably isolated, unless the adverse 
effect in question may be anticipated not to occur in the absence of therapy. 
The safety database is small; therefore, frequency estimates are uncertain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 201/207 
 
 
  
  
 
The hypothesis test embedded in the trial is not considered relevant with respect to establishing the 
clinical relevance of findings. A further concern is the heterogeneity of CR/CRd and the proportion 
bridged to SCT in the respective “stages” or subcohorts of the pivotal trial. Given the sample size, 
however, heterogeneity in point estimates is anticipated. Also if true activity is in line with the 
estimates from the worst-performing stage 4 (44% CR, 22% bridged to SCT), it would be considered 
established that tagraxofusp provides clinical benefit by allowing bridging to SCT in a non-negligible 
portion of patients. 
The DoR was sufficient to allow for bridging to transplant in about one third of the patients. However, 
its median duration in the absence of SCT was less than six months. Therefore, the most evident 
established benefit of tagraxofusp is its ability to provide bridging to SCT. 
The safety profile of tagraxofusp is non-trivial, including hepatotoxicity and potentially lethal capillary 
leak syndrome. However, the overall treatment-associated mortality is not higher than what has been 
reported with empirical chemotherapy, and importantly its haematological toxicity is limited. The 
proposed SmPC provides risk mitigation advice for the principal toxicities.  
The efficacy of tagraxofusp has been demonstrated in previously untreated patients. Data in the R/R 
setting does not independently allow for such an inference. 
7.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy demonstrated in a small SAT in this rare, aggressive disorder with no approved treatment 
alternatives, is considered relevant. The side effect profile is non-trivial but acceptable in the context. 
The benefits in previously untreated patients outweigh the risks. Benefits in the R/R setting have not 
been established as the pivotal study 0114 was not designed to formally test statistical hypothesis and 
its clinical relevance in this population. 
7.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As is evident from the above, there is an unmet medical need in this rare disorder with no approved 
treatment options. The B/R of tagraxofusp is positive in previously untreated (first-line) patients. 
However, due to the size of the database for safety as well as efficacy, and consequent uncertainties, 
data cannot be deemed comprehensive. Furthermore, due to the rarity of the disease, comprehensive 
data are not anticipated to be generated. Therefore, an approval based on exceptional circumstances is 
relevant. 
In this context, the applicant is required to submit the results from an observational study (e.g., using 
a registry) of sufficient size and duration to study these aspects, including planned comparative 
matched analyses using relevant external controls. 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was proposed by the CHMP during the re-examination, after having consulted the 
applicant. 
The CHMP considered that blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), is a rare 
haematological disorder with approximately 700 and 1000 incident cases annually in the US and 
Europe, respectively. The prognosis is poor, with median duration of overall survival after diagnosis 
reported at 9-13 months unless patients can undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/24699/2021 
Page 203/207 
 
 
  
  
 
associated with median duration of overall survival of 30 months or longer. The CHMP considers that 
the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide comprehensive data on the 
efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the indication applied for is encountered 
so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence. In this 
context, the applicant is required to submit the results from an observational study (e.g., using a 
registry) of sufficient size and duration to study these aspects, including planned comparative matched 
analyses using relevant external controls. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate. 
7.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Elzonris is positive provided the conditions outlined in the recommendations are 
fulfilled. 
8.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by consensus that the benefit-
risk balance of Elzonris in the following indication: 
Elzonris is indicated as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with  blastic 
plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) (see section 5.1).

9.  Appendix 
1. 
Divergent position to the majority recommendation for the initial opinion: 
DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 23 July 2020 
Elzonris EMEA/H/C/005031/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s negative opinion recommending 
the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation of Elzonris indicated as monotherapy for the 
treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
BPDCN is an ultra-rare malignancy with a short survival time, where bridging to stem cell 
transplantation is the only way to induce longer term remission. There are no approved therapies, 
whereas those that are used in clinical practice, are poorly documented. It has been shown that 
tagraxofusp has clinically relevant activity and can be used to bridge patients to SCT. The toxicity 
profile is non-trivial, but in accordance with the SAG opinion, this is deemed manageable given risk 
mitigation strategies, and acceptable in the therapeutic context. In summary, B/R has been shown to 
be positive, though the precise wording of the indication would remain to be specified.

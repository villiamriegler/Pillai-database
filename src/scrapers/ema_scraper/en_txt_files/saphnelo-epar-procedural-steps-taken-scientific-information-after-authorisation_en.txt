1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC and PL 
Patients who completed D3461C00004 [study 04] and 
based on final results from study D3461C00009 
listed as an additional pharmacovigilance activity in 
the RMP; this is a multicentre, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled Phase III extension study to 
characterise the long-term safety and tolerability of 
anifrolumab in adult subjects with active systemic 
lupus erythematosus. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to implement minor changes to sections 
4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC and to the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
study D3461C00005 [study 05] (feeder trials) through 
Week 52 were eligible to continue on treatment in a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-year Long 
Term Extension (study D3461C00009).  
Following long-term observations, the clearance of 
anifrolumab was found to be stable in years 2 through 4 on 
treatment. 
Long-term efficacy was evaluated in patients who received 
anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo in a feeder trial and 
continued to receive the same treatment in the LTE

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
(anifrolumab N=257; placebo N=112). Of these, 69% of 
patients who received anifrolumab (177/257) and 46% of 
patients who received placebo (52/112) completed a total 
of 4 years on treatment. At Week 208, the mean SLEDAI-
2K score (SE) was 3.4 (0.25) and 4.0 (0.46) in patients 
who received anifrolumab (n=140) and placebo (n=44) 
respectively. 
The overall long-term safety profile of anifrolumab was 
consistent with the 52 week trials.

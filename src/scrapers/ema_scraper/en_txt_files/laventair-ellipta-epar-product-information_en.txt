CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is indicated as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Posology 
The recommended and maximum dose is one inhalation once daily. 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA should be administered at the same time of the day each day to maintain 
bronchodilation. If a dose is missed the next dose should be inhaled at the usual time the next day. 
Special populations  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The use of 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and should be used 
with caution (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA in the paediatric population (under 18 years of age) for 
the indication of COPD. 
Method of administration  
For inhalation use only. 
The following instructions for the 30 dose inhaler (30 day supply) also apply to the 7 dose inhaler (7 day 
supply). 
The ELLIPTA inhaler contains pre-dispensed doses and is ready to use. 
The inhaler is packaged in a tray containing a desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. The desiccant sachet 
should be thrown away and it should not be opened, eaten or inhaled. The patient should be advised to not 
open the tray until they are ready to inhale a dose. 
The inhaler will be in the ‘closed’ position when it is first taken out of its sealed tray. The “Discard by” date 
should be written on the inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks from the date 
of opening the tray. After this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first 
opening. 
If the inhaler cover is opened and closed without inhaling the medicinal product, the dose will be lost. The 
lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available to be inhaled. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicinal product or a double dose in one inhalation. 
Instructions for use: 
a) 
Prepare a dose 
Open the cover when ready to inhale a dose. The inhaler should not be shaken. 
Slide the cover down until a “click” is heard. The medicinal product is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. If the dose counter does not count down as the “click” is 
heard, the inhaler will not deliver a dose and should be taken back to a pharmacist for advice. 
b) 
How to inhale the medicinal product 
The inhaler should be held away from the mouth breathing out as far as is comfortable. But not breathing out 
into the inhaler. 
The mouthpiece should be placed between the lips and the lips should then be closed firmly around it. The air 
vents should not be blocked with fingers during use. 
• 
• 
• 
Inhale with one long, steady, deep breath in. This breath should be held in for as long as possible (at 
least 3-4 seconds). 
Remove the inhaler from the mouth. 
Breathe out slowly and gently.

Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Asthma 
This medicinal product should not be used in patients with asthma since it has not been studied in this patient 
population. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol may produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-
threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, treatment should be discontinued immediately and 
alternative therapy instituted if necessary. 
Not for acute use  
Umeclidinium/vilanterol is not indicated for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.  
Deterioration of disease 
Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control. In the 
event of deterioration of COPD during treatment with umeclidinium/vilanterol, a re-evaluation of the patient 
and of the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken.  
Cardiovascular effects 
Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, may be seen after 
the administration of muscarinic receptor antagonists and sympathomimetics, including 
umeclidinium/vilanterol (see section 4.8). Patients with clinically significant uncontrolled cardiovascular 
disease were excluded from clinical studies. Therefore, umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution 
in patients with severe cardiovascular disease. 
Antimuscarinic activity  
Due to its antimuscarinic activity, umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients with 
urinary retention or with narrow-angle glaucoma. 
Hypokalaemia  
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, which has the potential to 
produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring 
supplementation.  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically relevant effects of hypokalaemia were observed in clinical studies with umeclidinium/vilanterol 
at the recommended therapeutic dose. Caution should be exercised when umeclidinium/vilanterol is used 
with other medicinal products that also have the potential to cause hypokalaemia (see section 4.5). 
Hyperglycaemia 
Beta2-adrenergic agonists may produce transient hyperglycemia in some patients.  
No clinically relevant effects on plasma glucose were observed in clinical studies with 
umeclidinium/vilanterol at the recommended therapeutic dose. Upon initiation of treatment with 
umeclidinium/vilanterol plasma glucose should be monitored more closely in diabetic patients. 
Coexisting conditions  
Umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis, 
and in patients who are unusually responsive to beta2-adrenergic agonists. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not use this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
Clinically significant interactions mediated by umeclidinium/vilanterol at clinical doses are considered 
unlikely due to the low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Beta-adrenergic blockers 
Beta2-adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, such as 
vilanterol. Concurrent use of either non-selective or selective beta-adrenergic blockers should be avoided 
unless there are compelling reasons for their use. 
Metabolic and transporter based interactions  
Vilanterol is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin) may inhibit the 
metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, vilanterol. Co-administration with ketoconazole 
(400 mg) in healthy volunteers increased mean vilanterol AUC(0-t) and Cmax, 65% and 22% respectively. The 
increase in vilanterol exposure was not associated with an increase in beta-adrenergic agonist related 
systemic effects on heart rate, blood potassium or QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia method). Care 
is advised when co-administering umeclidinium/vilanterol with ketoconazole and other known strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors as there is potential for an increased systemic exposure to vilanterol, which could lead to 
an increase in the potential for adverse reactions. Verapamil, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not 
significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of vilanterol. 
Umeclidinium is a substrate of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
umeclidinium was assessed in healthy volunteers lacking CYP2D6 (poor metabolisers). No effect on 
umeclidinium AUC or Cmax was observed at a 8-fold higher dose. An approximately 1.3-fold increase in 
umeclidinium AUC was observed at 16-fold higher dose with no effect on umeclidinium Cmax. Based on the 
magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant interaction is expected when umeclidinium/vilanterol is 
co-administered with CYP2D6 inhibitors or when administered to patients genetically deficient in CYP2D6 
activity (poor metabolisers). 
Both umeclidinium and vilanterol are substrates of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). The effect of the 
moderate P-gp inhibitor verapamil (240 mg once daily) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
umeclidinium and vilanterol was assessed in healthy volunteers. No effect of verapamil was observed on 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
umeclidinium or vilanterol Cmax. An approximately 1.4-fold increase in umeclidinium AUC was observed 
with no effect on vilanterol AUC. Based on the magnitude of these changes, no clinically relevant drug 
interaction is expected when umeclidinium/vilanterol is co-administered with P-gp inhibitors. 
Other antimuscarinics and sympathomimetics 
Co-administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol with other long-acting muscarinic antagonists, long-acting 
beta2-adrenergic agonists or medicinal products containing either of these agents has not been studied and is 
not recommended as it may potentiate known inhaled muscarinic antagonist or beta2-adrenergic agonist 
adverse reactions (see sections 4.4 and 4.9). 
Hypokalaemia 
Concomitant hypokalaemic treatment with methylxanthine derivatives, steroids, or non-potassium-sparing 
diuretics may potentiate the possible hypokalaemic effect of beta2-adrenergic agonists, therefore use with 
caution (see section 4.4). 
Other medicinal products for COPD 
Although no formal in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed, inhaled umeclidinium/vilanterol 
has been used concomitantly with other COPD medicinal products including short acting sympathomimetic 
bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids without clinical evidence of drug interactions. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of umeclidinium/vilanterol in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive  toxicity  at  exposures  which  are  not  clinically  relevant  after  administration  of  vilanterol  (see 
section 5.3). 
Umeclidinium/vilanterol should be used during pregnancy only if the expected benefit to the mother justifies 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether umeclidinium or vilanterol are excreted in human milk. However, other 
beta2-adrenergic agonists are detected in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A 
decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue umeclidinium/vilanterol 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of umeclidinium/vilanterol on human fertility. Animal studies indicate no 
effects of umeclidinium or vilanterol on fertility.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Umeclidinium/vilanterol has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction is nasopharyngitis (9%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety profile of LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is based on safety experience with umeclidinium/vilanterol 
and the individual components from the clinical development program comprising of 6 855 patients with 
COPD and from spontaneous reporting. The clinical development programme included 2 354 patients who 
received umeclidinium/vilanterol once daily in the Phase III clinical studies of 24 weeks or more, of whom 
1 296 patients received the recommended dose of 55/22 micrograms in 24-week studies, 832 patients 
received a higher dose of 113/22 micrograms in 24-week studies and 226 patients received 113/22 
micrograms in a 12-month study. 
The frequencies assigned to the adverse reactions identified in the table below include crude incidence rates 
observed in the integration of five 24-week studies and in the 12-month safety study.  
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare 
(<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
An overdose of umeclidinium/vilanterol will likely produce signs and symptoms due to the individual 
components’ actions, consistent with the known inhaled muscarinic antagonist adverse reactions (e.g. dry 
mouth, visual accommodation disturbances and tachycardia) or those with overdose of other beta2-adrenergic 
agonists (e.g. arrhythmias, tremor, headache, palpitations, nausea, hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia). 
If overdose occurs, the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, adrenergics in combination with 
anticholinergics incl. triple combinations with corticosteroids, ATC code: R03AL03  
Mechanism of action 
Umeclidinium/vilanterol is a combination inhaled long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist/long-acting 
beta2-adrenergic agonist (LAMA/LABA). Following oral inhalation both compounds act locally on airways 
to produce bronchodilation by separate mechanisms. 
Umeclidinium 
Umeclidinium is a long acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (also referred to as an anticholinergic). It is a 
quinuclidine derivative with activity across multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes. Umeclidinium exerts its 
bronchodilatory activity by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors 
on airway smooth muscle. It demonstrates slow reversibility at the human M3 muscarinic receptor subtype in 
vitro and a long duration of action in vivo when administered directly to the lungs in pre-clinical models. 
Vilanterol 
Vilanterol is a selective long-acting, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA).  
The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenergic agonists, including vilanterol, are at least in part attributable to 
stimulation of intracellular adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’,5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels 
cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate 
hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In Phase III, 6-month studies umeclidinium/vilanterol provided clinically meaningful improvements over 
placebo in lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) over 24 hours 
following once daily administration, which were evident at 15 minutes following administration of the first 
dose (improvement over placebo by 112 ml (p <0.001*). Mean peak improvements in FEV1 within the first 6 
hours following dosing relative to placebo was 224 ml (p<0.001∗) at week 24. There was no evidence for 
tachyphylaxis in the effect of LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA over time. 
Cardiac electrophysiology  
The effect of umeclidinium/vilanterol on the QT interval was evaluated in a placebo and active 
(moxifloxacin) controlled QT study involving once daily administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol 
113/22 micrograms or 500/100 micrograms (pre-dispensed dose with umeclidinium at eight times the 
recommended dose and vilanterol at four times the recommended dose) for 10 days in 103 healthy 
volunteers. The maximum mean difference in prolongations of QT interval (corrected using the Fridericia 
method, QTcF) from placebo after baseline-correction was 4.3 (90% CI=2.2 to 6.4) milliseconds seen 10 
minutes after administration with umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms and 8.2 (90% CI=6.2 to 10.2) 
milliseconds seen 30 minutes after administration with umeclidinium/vilanterol 500/100 micrograms. 
Therefore, no clinically relevant pro-arrhythmic potential related to QT-interval prolongations was observed 
with umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms. 
A dose-dependent increase in heart rate was also observed. The maximum mean difference in heart rate from 
placebo after baseline-correction was 8.4 (90% CI=7.0 to 9.8) beats/minute and 20.3 (90% CI=18.9 to 21.7) 
beats/minute seen 10 minutes after administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms and 
500/100 micrograms respectively.  
∗ A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison that did 
not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be inferred. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, no clinically significant effects on cardiac rhythm were observed on 24-hour Holter monitoring 
in 53 patients with COPD who were treated with umeclidinium/vilanterol 55/22 micrograms once daily in 
one 6-month study, or in a further 55 patients who received umeclidinium/vilanterol 113/22 micrograms once 
daily in another 6-month study and 226 patients who received 113/22 micrograms once daily in the 12-month 
study. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The clinical efficacy of umeclidinium/vilanterol administered once daily was evaluated in eight Phase III 
clinical studies in 6 835 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD; 5 618 patients from five 6-month 
studies (two placebo-controlled and three active [tiotropium]-comparator controlled), 655 patients from two 
3-month exercise endurance/lung function studies and 562 patients from a 12-month supportive study.  
Effects on lung function 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA demonstrated improvements in lung function (as defined by change from baseline 
in trough FEV1) in several studies. In one 6-month Phase III study, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA demonstrated 
statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 (primary endpoint) at week 24 compared with placebo 
and each monotherapy component treatment arm. In addition, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA demonstrated 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in trough FEV1 compared with tiotropium in 
two of the three 6-month active-comparator studies and numerically greater improvements from tiotropium in 
the third active-comparator study (see Table 1). There was no attenuation of the bronchodilator effect over 
time. 
Symptomatic outcomes 
Breathlessness: 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in 
breathlessness as evaluated by an increase in TDI focal score at week 24 (key secondary end-point) 
compared with placebo (see Table 1). Improvements in TDI focal score compared with each monotherapy 
component and tiotropium were not statistically significant (see Table 1). 
The proportion of patients who responded with at least the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) 
of 1 unit TDI focal score at week 24 was greater for LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA (58%) compared with placebo 
(41%) and each monotherapy component (53% for umeclidinium and 51% for vilanterol).  
Health-related quality of life: 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA has also shown an improvement in health-related quality of life measured using the 
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as indicated by a reduction in SGRQ total score at week 24 
compared with placebo and each monotherapy component (see Table 1). LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA showed a 
statistically significant reduction in SGRQ total score compared with tiotropium in one of the three active-
comparator studies (see Table 1). 
The proportion of patients who responded with at least the MCID in SGRQ score (defined as a decrease of 
4 units from baseline) at week 24 was greater for LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA (49%) compared with placebo 
(34%) and each monotherapy component (44% for umeclidinium and 48% for vilanterol). In one 
active-comparator study, a higher percentage of patients receiving LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA responded with a 
clinically meaningful improvement in SGRQ score at week 24 (53%) compared to tiotropium (46%). In the 
other two active-comparator studies, a similar proportion of patients achieved at least the MCID with 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA and tiotropium; 49% and 54% for LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms and 
52% and 55% for tiotropium. 
Use of rescue medication 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA reduced the use of rescue medication with salbutamol over weeks 1-24 compared 
with placebo and umeclidinium (see Table 1) and demonstrated an increase from baseline in the proportion 
of days when no rescue medication was needed (on average 11.1%) compared with a decrease from baseline 
on placebo (on average 0.9%).  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the three 6-month active-comparator-controlled studies, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA reduced the use of 
rescue medication with salbutamol compared with tiotropium, with statistically significant reductions 
observed in two of the studies (see Table 1). LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA also demonstrated a greater increase 
from baseline in the proportion of days when no rescue medication was needed in all three studies (average 
within the range 17.6% to 21.5%) compared with tiotropium (average within the range 11.7% to 13.4%).

A higher dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol (113/22 micrograms) was also studied in a 24-week placebo 
controlled clinical study and in two of the three 24-week active-controlled studies. The results were similar to 
those for the LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA dose and provided additional supportive evidence for the efficacy of 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA.  
COPD exacerbations 
In a 24-week placebo-controlled study in patients with symptomatic COPD, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 
reduced the risk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation by 50% compared with placebo (based on analysis 
of time to first exacerbation: Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.8; p=0.004*); by 20% compared with 
umeclidinium (HR 0.8; 95% CI: 0.5, 1.3; p=0.391); and by 30% compared with vilanterol (HR 0.7; 95% CI: 
0.4, 1.1; p=0.121). From the three active-comparator studies in patients with symptomatic COPD, the risk of 
a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation compared with tiotropium was reduced by 50% in one study (HR 0.5; 
95% CI: 0.3, 1.0; p=0.044). In the other two studies, the risk of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation was 
increased by 20% and 90% (HR 1.2; 95% CI: 0.5, 2.6; p=0.709 and HR 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0, 3.6; p=0.062 
respectively). These studies were not specifically designed to evaluate the effect of treatments on COPD 
exacerbations and patients were withdrawn from the study if an exacerbation occurred. 
Supporting efficacy studies   
In a randomised, double-blind, 52-week study (CTT116855, IMPACT), 10 355 adult patients with 
symptomatic COPD and a history of 1 or more moderate/severe exacerbations in the prior 12 months were 
randomised (1:2:2) to receive umeclidinium/vilanterol (UMEC/VI 55/22 micrograms), fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI 92/55/22 micrograms), or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 
(FF/VI 92/22 micrograms) administered once daily as a single inhaler. The primary endpoint was annual rate 
of on-treatment moderate and severe exacerbations in subjects treated with FF/UMEC/VI compared with 
FF/VI and UMEC/VI. The mean annual rate of exacerbations was 0.91, 1.07 and 1.21 for FF/UMEC/VI, 
FF/VI, and UMEC/VI respectively. 
The comparison of FF/UMEC/VI to FF/VI and UMEC/VI resulted in a statistically significant 14.8% 
reduction in risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation (based on analysis of time to first exacerbation) (Hazard 
Ratio 0.85; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.91; p<0.001) and 16.0% reduction in risk of a moderate/severe exacerbation 
respectively (based on analysis of time to first exacerbation) (Hazard Ratio 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.91; 
p<0.001). 
Exercise endurance and lung volumes 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms improved exercise endurance time compared with placebo, as 
evaluated with the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT), in one study but not the second and improved lung 
volume measures compared with placebo in both studies in adult COPD patients with hyperinflation 
(functional residual capacity [FRC] >120%). In the first study, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms 
demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement (based on a minimal clinically 
important difference (MCID) between 45 to 85 seconds) over placebo in exercise endurance time (EET) 
obtained 3 hours after dosing at week 12 (69.4 seconds [p=0.003]). Improvement in EET compared with 
placebo was seen at Day 2 and was sustained at week 6 and week 12. In the second study, the treatment 
difference in EET between LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms and placebo was 21.9 seconds 
(p=0.234) at week 12. 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms also showed statistically significant improvements compared 
with placebo in change from baseline in lung volume measures at trough and at 3 hours post dose at week 12 
in the first study (inspiratory capacity: 237 ml and 316 ml respectively, residual volume: -466 ml and -643 ml 
respectively and functional residual capacity: -351 ml and -522 ml respectively; all p<0.001). In the second 
study, LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA 55/22 micrograms showed improvements compared with placebo in change 
from baseline in lung volume measures at trough and at 3 hours post dose at week 12 (inspiratory capacity: 
198 ml and 238 ml respectively, residual volume: -295 ml and -351 ml respectively and functional residual 
capacity: -238 ml and -302 ml respectively); all p<0.001∗). 
∗ A step-down statistical testing procedure was used in this study and this comparison was below a comparison that did 
not achieve statistical significance. Therefore, statistical significance on this comparison cannot be inferred.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA in all subsets of the paediatric population in COPD (see section 4.2 for information 
on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
When umeclidinium and vilanterol were administered in combination by the inhaled route, the 
pharmacokinetics of each component was similar to those observed when each active substance was 
administered separately. For pharmacokinetic purposes each component can therefore be considered 
separately. 
Absorption 
Umeclidinium 
Following inhaled administration of umeclidinium in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 15 minutes. 
The absolute bioavailability of inhaled umeclidinium was on average 13% of the dose, with negligible 
contribution from oral absorption. Following repeat dosing of inhaled umeclidinium, steady state was 
achieved within 7 to 10 days with 1.5 to 1.8-fold accumulation.  
Vilanterol 
Following inhaled administration of vilanterol in healthy volunteers, Cmax occurred at 5 to 15 minutes. The 
absolute bioavailability of inhaled vilanterol was 27%, with negligible contribution from oral absorption. 
Following repeat dosing of inhaled vilanterol, steady state was achieved within 6 days with up to 2.4-fold 
accumulation.  
Distribution 
Umeclidinium  
Following intravenous administration to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution was 86 litres. 
In vitro plasma protein binding in human plasma was on average 89%. 
Vilanterol 
Following intravenous administration to healthy volunteers, the mean volume of distribution at steady state 
was 165 litres. Vilanterol has a low association with red blood cells. In vitro plasma protein binding in human 
plasma was on average 94%. 
Biotransformation 
Umeclidinium 
In vitro studies showed that umeclidinium is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) and 
is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter. The primary metabolic routes for umeclidinium are 
oxidative (hydroxylation, O-dealkylation) followed by conjugation (glucuronidation, etc), resulting in a range 
of metabolites with either reduced pharmacological activity or for which the pharmacological activity has not 
been established. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. 
Vilanterol 
In vitro studies showed that vilanterol is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a 
substrate for the P-gp transporter. The primary metabolic routes for vilanterol are O-dealkylation to a range 
of metabolites with significantly reduced beta1- and beta2-adrenergic agonist activity. Plasma metabolic 
profiles following oral administration of vilanterol in a human radiolabel study were consistent with high 
first-pass metabolism. Systemic exposure to the metabolites is low. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
Umeclidinium  
Plasma clearance following intravenous administration was 151 litres/hour. Following intravenous 
administration, approximately 58% of the administered radiolabelled dose (or 73% of the recovered 
radioactivity) was excreted in faeces by 192 hours post-dose. Urinary elimination accounted for 22% of the 
administered radiolabelled dose by 168 hours (27% of recovered radioactivity). The excretion of the 
drug-related material in the faeces following intravenous dosing indicated secretion into the bile. Following 
oral administration to healthy male volunteers, total radioactivity was excreted primarily in faeces (92% of 
the administered radiolabelled dose or 99% of the recovered radioactivity) by 168 hours post-dose. Less than 
1% of the orally administered dose (1% of recovered radioactivity) was excreted in urine, suggesting 
negligible absorption following oral administration. Umeclidinium plasma elimination half-life following 
inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 19 hours in healthy volunteers, with 3% to 4% excreted unchanged in 
urine at steady-state. 
Vilanterol 
Plasma clearance of vilanterol following intravenous administration was 108 litres/hour. Following oral 
administration of radiolabelled vilanterol, mass balance showed 70% of the radiolabel in urine and 30% in 
faeces. Primary elimination of vilanterol was by metabolism followed by excretion of metabolites in urine 
and faeces. Vilanterol plasma elimination half-life following inhaled dosing for 10 days averaged 11 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium and vilanterol were 
similar between COPD patients 65 years and older and those younger than 65 years of age. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment showed no evidence of an increase in systemic exposure to either 
umeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) following administration of umeclidinium/vilanterol with 
umeclidinium at twice the recommended dose and vilanterol at the recommended dose and no evidence of 
altered protein binding between patients with severe renal impairment and healthy volunteers. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) showed no evidence of an increase in 
systemic exposure to either umeclidinium or vilanterol (Cmax and AUC) following administration of 
umeclidinium/vilanterol with umeclidinium at twice the recommended dose and vilanterol at the 
recommended dose and no evidence of altered protein binding between patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment and healthy volunteers. Umeclidinium/vilanterol has not been evaluated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Other special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that no dose adjustment is required for umeclidinium or 
vilanterol based on the effect of age, race, gender, inhaled corticosteroid use, or weight. A study in CYP2D6 
poor metabolisers showed no evidence of a clinically significant effect of CYP2D6 genetic polymorphism on 
systemic exposure to umeclidinium.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
In non-clinical studies with umeclidinium and vilanterol, alone and in combination, findings were those 
typically associated with the primary pharmacology of either muscarinic receptor antagonists or 
beta2-adrenergic agonists respectively and/or local irritancy. The following statements reflect studies 
conducted on the individual components. 
14 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Umeclidinium was not genotoxic in a standard battery of studies and was not carcinogenic in lifetime 
inhalation studies in mice or rats at exposures ≥ 26 or ≥ 22-fold, times the human clinical exposure of 
umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC, respectively. 
In genetic toxicity studies, vilanterol (as alpha-phenylcinnamate) and triphenylacetic acid were not genotoxic 
indicating that vilanterol (as trifenatate) does not represent a genotoxic hazard to humans. Consistent with 
findings for other beta2-adrenergic agonists, in lifetime inhalation studies, vilanterol trifenatate caused 
proliferative effects in the female rat and mouse reproductive tract and in the rat pituitary gland. There was 
no increase in tumour incidence in rats or mice at exposures 0.5- or 13-fold, times the human clinical 
exposure of vilanterol 22 micrograms based on AUC, respectively. 
Toxicity to reproduction 
Umeclidinium was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits. In a pre- and post-natal study, subcutaneous 
administration of umeclidinium to rats resulted in lower maternal body weight gain and food consumption 
and slightly decreased pre-weaning pup body weights in dams given 180 micrograms/kg/day dose 
(approximately 80-times the human clinical exposure of umeclidinium 55 micrograms, based on AUC). 
Vilanterol was not teratogenic in rats. In inhalation studies in rabbits, vilanterol caused effects similar to 
those seen with other beta2-adrenergic agonists (cleft palate, open eyelids, sternebral fusion and limb 
flexure/malrotation) at 6-times the human clinical exposure based on AUC. When given subcutaneously 
there were no effects at 36-times the human clinical exposure of vilanterol 22 micrograms, based on AUC.

Step-by-step instructions  
1.  What LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is and what it is used for 
What LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is  
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA contains two active substances umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol. These belong 
to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. 
What LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is used for  
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. COPD is 
a long-term condition characterised by breathing difficulties that slowly get worse.  
In COPD the muscles around the airways tighten. This medicine blocks the tightening of these muscles in the 
lungs, making it easier for air to get in and out of the lungs. When used regularly, it can help to control your 
breathing difficulties and reduce the effects of COPD on your everyday life.  
LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA should not be used to relieve a sudden attack of breathlessness or 
wheezing.  
If you get this sort of attack you must use a quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol). If you 
do not have a quick-acting inhaler contact your doctor.

your quick-acting inhaler more often: 
contact your doctor as soon as possible.

disturbances, have a dry mouth, or have a headache.

32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you become wheezy or breathless, use your quick-acting reliever inhaler (such as salbutamol), then seek 
medical advice. 
If you stop using LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA  
Use this medicine for as long as your doctor recommends. It will only be effective as long as you are using it.

Step-by-step instructions 
What is the ELLIPTA inhaler? 
The first time you use LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA you do not need to check that the inhaler is working 
properly; it contains previously measured doses and is ready to use straight away. 
Your LAVENTAIR ELLIPTA inhaler carton contains

Carton 
This leaflet 
The inhaler is packaged in a tray. Do not open the tray until you are ready to start using your new 
inhaler. When you are ready to use your inhaler, peel back the lid to open the tray. The tray contains a 
desiccant sachet, to reduce moisture. Throw this desiccant sachet away – do not open, eat or inhale it. 
Desiccant 
When you take the inhaler out of its tray, it will be in the ‘closed’ position. Do not open the inhaler until 
you are ready to inhale a dose of medicine. When the tray is opened, write the “Discard by” date on the 
inhaler label in the space provided. The “Discard by” date is 6 weeks from the date you open the tray. After 
this date the inhaler should no longer be used. The tray can be discarded after first opening. 
If stored in a refrigerator, allow the inhaler to return to room temperature for at least one hour before use.

The step-by-step instructions for use of the inhaler provided below can be used for either the 30-dose inhaler 
(30-day supply) or the 7-dose inhaler (7-day supply). 
Read this before you start 
1) 
If you open and close the cover without inhaling the medicine, you will lose the dose.  
The lost dose will be securely held inside the inhaler, but it will no longer be available. 
It is not possible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in one inhalation. 
2) 
Prepare a dose 
Wait to open the cover until you are ready to inhale your dose.  
Do not shake the inhaler. 
• 
Slide the cover down until you hear a “click”. 
Your medicine is now ready to be inhaled. 
The dose counter counts down by 1 to confirm. 
• 
If the dose counter does not count down as you hear the “click”, the inhaler will not deliver 
medicine.  
Take it back to your pharmacist for advice. 
3) 
Inhale your medicine  
•  While holding the inhaler away from your mouth, breathe out as far as is comfortable.  
Do not breathe out into the inhaler. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Put the mouthpiece between your lips, and close your lips firmly around it. 
Do not block the air vent with your fingers. 
Your lips fit over the 
contoured shape of the 
mouthpiece for inhaling. 
Do not block the air vent 
with your fingers. 
• 
• 
• 
Take one long, steady, deep breath in. Hold this breath in for as long as possible (at least 3-4 seconds). 
Remove the inhaler from your mouth. 
Breathe out slowly and gently. 
You may not be able to taste or feel the medicine, even when you are using the inhaler correctly. 
If you want to clean the mouthpiece, use a dry tissue, before you close the cover. 
4) 
Close the inhaler 
Slide the cover upwards as far as it will go, to cover the mouthpiece.

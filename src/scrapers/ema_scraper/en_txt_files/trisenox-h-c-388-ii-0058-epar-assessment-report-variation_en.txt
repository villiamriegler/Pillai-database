2.1.  Introduction 
29 September 2016

13 October 2016 
Acute  promyelocytic  leukemia  (APL)  is  a  potentially  life  threatening  rare  subtype  of  acute  myeloid 
leukemia  (AML)  characterized  by  the  presence  of  the  Promyelocytic  Leukemia  Retinoic  Acid  Receptor 
Alpha (PML-RARα) fusion transcript. One subtype of AML accounting for approximately 10 % of AML cases 
is  acute  promyelocytic  leukemia  (APL).  The  annual  incidence  of  APL  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  is 
reported to be 0.14/100,000 (Sant et al 2010).  
APL is identified as AML-M3 by the FAB classification, and is characterised by several distinct pathological 
features:  (i)  the  morphology  of  the  promyelocytic  cells  with  granulocytic  features  in  their  cytoplasm  as 
observed  by  bone  aspirates  smears  stained  with  H&E,  (ii)  The  cytological  examination  shows  a  specific 
t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1)  translocation  and  gene  rearrangement  which  generates  a  fusion  transcript  of  the 
PML  (promyelocyte)  and  RAR-α  (retinoic  acid  receptor-α)  genes,  and  finally  (iii)  an  decrease  in  white 
blood cell count where 75% of APL patients <10G/L. 
The first-line treatment of APL is currently based on the combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with 
chemotherapy  (mainly  anthracyclines)  during  both  treatment  induction  and  consolidation  (see  i.e.  Lo-
Coco et al 2010). Treatment characteristics may change according to disease risk (Fey and Buske 2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 6/74 
 
  
  
 
With  ATRA  plus  idarubicin  (AIDA  protocol),  the 6-year  overall  survival  (OS)  and  cumulative  incidence of 
relapse  (CIR)  rates  are  87.4%  and  10.7%,  respectively.  However,  with  the  available  treatments,  the 
early death rate, mainly due to late diagnosis and haemorrhagic complications, is still high (18 to 21%), 
the 2-year relapse rate is 8 to 10% and the development of potentially fatal differentiation syndrome is 
always  possible.  Moreover,  the  exposure  to  anthracyclines  has  been  associated  with  death  in  remission 
due to late cardiotoxicity and the onset of secondary leukemia (2 to 5% patients). 
Trisenox (arsenic trioxide or ATO) is currently authorised for the induction and consolidation treatment of 
relapsed/refractory APL patients. However, recent studies with ATO have shown high efficacy and reduced 
haematological toxicity in patients with newly diagnosed APL (see i.e. Estey et al 2006, Ghavamzadeh et 
al 2011, Mathews et al 2006, Ravandi et al 2009). 
The treatment for APL as changed over the years and has progressively increased the CR: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In 1973, the therapy consisted of Daunorubicin+ massive platelet transfusions which resulted in 
up to 80% CR, 40 to 50% prolonged CR (Bernard et al, 1973). 
In  1988,  the  use  of  all-transretinoic  acid  (ATRA)  which  promotes  the  differentiation  of  APL  cells 
resulted in 90% CR (Huang et al, 1988).  
In  1991,  the  use  of  ATRA+  chemotherapy  increased  the  CR  to 90%  but  still had  a  25%  relapse 
rate (ASH plenary 1991). 
In  1997,  the  maintenance  treatment  with  ATRA  and  low  dose  chemotherapy  reduced  relapses  5 
to 10% relapses (ASH plenary 1993). 
In  2000,  AraC  treatment  was  found  to  be  unnecessary  in  standard  at  risk  patients    (Sanz  et  al, 
2004) 
•  Standard treatment currently provides a CR of 90% and approximately 80% cures, but 9-10% of 
patients have an early death, 5% death in patients in CR, 5-10% patients relapse  and 1-2% of 
patients developing MDS and AML  
• 
Patients  having  an  early  death  or  death  in  CR  are  mainly  older  patients  because  of  their  lower 
tolerability to chemotherapy. 
The current indication for Trisenox is as follows: 
TRISENOX 
is 
indicated 
for 
induction  of  remission  and  consolidation 
in  adult  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia  (APL),  characterised  by  the  presence  of  the  t(15;17) 
translocation  and/or  the  presence  of  the  Pro-Myelocytic  Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha 
(PML/RAR-alpha) gene. Previous treatment should have included a retinoid and chemotherapy. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to TRISENOX has not been examined. 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication: TRISENOX is indicated for 
induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk 
acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia  (APL)  (white  blood  cell  count,  ≤  10  x  103/μl)  characterised  by  the 
presence  of  the  t(15;17)  translocation  and/or  the  presence  of  the  Pro-Myelocytic  Leukaemia/Retinoic-
Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The  recommended  indication  for  approval  is:  TRISENOX  is  indicated  for  induction  of  remission,  and 
consolidation  in  adult  patients  with:  Newly  diagnosed  low-to-intermediate  risk  acute  promyelocytic 
leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, ≤ 10 x 103/µl) in combination with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) 
characterised  by  the  presence  of  the  t(15;17)  translocation  and/or  the  presence  of  the  Pro-Myelocytic 
Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene (SmPC section 4.1). 
The recommended dose is as follows: 
Induction treatment schedule 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 7/74 
 
  
  
 
TRISENOX  must  be  administered  intravenously  at  a  dose  of  0.15  mg/kg/day,  given  daily  until  complete 
remission is achieved. If complete remission has not occurred by day 60, dosing must be discontinued. 
Consolidation schedule 
TRISENOX must be administered intravenously at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 5 days per week. Treatment 
should be continued for 4 weeks on and 4 weeks off, for a total of 4 cycles (SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non clinical data with the exception of ERA have been submitted in this application, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has performed a Phase I assessment, as specified in the ERA guideline. Based on the 
common definition of an organic substance in chemistry in the REACH guidance, PBT and vPvB criteria are 
not applicable to inorganic substances and log Kow determination for trisenox is not required. 
The calculation of the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECSW) based on the 
default Fpen value for an orphan indication and taking into account the maximal total dose of trisenox per 
patient for induction and consolidation (9 mg) converted to a daily dose per patient was below the 
threshold of 0.01 µg/l.  Thus, there is no need for a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis.

2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The environmental risk assessment for trisenox was conducted according to the current guideline. The 
predicted logK ow for trisenox is inferior to 4.5, threshold for screening so no further investigation are

required provided that the Log Dow values can be supported by experimental data. The PECsw is lower 
than the action limit of 0.01 µg/l the contribution of the current therapeutic use of trisenox seems to be 
minor compared to the existing environmental level.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of arsenic trioxide.  
Considering the above data, arsenic trioxide is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

The MAH has submitted an application based on the analysis of efficacy of data obtained from: 
• 
Pivotal data 
-Study APL0406, original cohort (Lo-Coco and al 2013a, Lo-Coco and al 2013b, Lo-Coco and al 2015) 
-Study APL0406, extended cohort (Platzbecker and al 2014, Platzbecker and al 2016) 
•  Supportive data 
-Study AML17 (Burnett et al 2015) 
-Literature review of studies with ATO alone or ATRA+ATO in first-line APL. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No formal analyses were performed for the evaluation of dose-response or blood level response 
relationships in the APL0406 and AML17 studies.  
The dose and schedule selected for study APL0406 are based on the currently approved dose and 
schedule for the relapsed/refractory APL patient population, adapted for use in first-line treatment on the 
basis of favourable clinical research results reported from a Phase 2 study of ATRA+ATO (Ravandi et al 
2009). This study showed that the ATRA+ATO combination was safe and effective in first-line treatment 
of patients with low- to intermediate-risk APL at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 10/74 
 
  
  
 
 
During induction, patients in the APL0406 study in the ATRA+ATO group received ATRA 45 mg/m2+ATO 
0.15mg/kg daily until CR for up to 60 days (10 days longer than the currently approved dose for the 
relapsed setting in Europe, but the same duration as the recommendation in the current United States 
Product Insert, [USPI]). During consolidation, patients in Study APL0406 received ATO 0.15 mg/kg/day 5 
days/week (4 weeks on/4 weeks off for 4 courses); in currently approved labelling for the relapsed 
population, ATO is administered 0.15 mg/kg/day 5 days/week for 5 weeks.  
The dosing schedule in the AML17 study was based on the dose used in a Phase 2 study with ATO in 
myelodysplastic syndrome (Vey et al 2006) in order to improve compliance.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
APL-0406  
The study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 non-inferiority trial, designed 
to  compare  arsenic  trioxide  (ATO)  combined  to  ATRA  versus  standard  ATRA  and  anthracycline-based 
chemotherapy  (AIDA  regimen)  for  newly  diagnosed,  non-high-risk  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia 
patients. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study population comprised newly diagnosed patients with low- to intermediate-risk APL (WBC count 
at diagnosis ≤10 x 109/L) aged 18 to 71 years.  
Main inclusion criteria (published APL0406 study protocol) 
- Newly diagnosed APL by cytomorphology, confirmed also by molecular analysis 
- Age ≥ 18 < 71 years 
- WHO performance status 0-2 included 
- WBC at diagnosis ≤ 10 x 109/L 
- Serum total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (≤ 51μmol/L) 
- Serum creatinine ≤ 3.0 mg/dL (≤ 260 μmol/L [≤ 265 μmol/L according to Lo-Coco et al. 2013). 
Genetic  confirmation  of  diagnosis  was  carried  out  by  reference  laboratories  and  was  mandatory  for 
patient eligibility. However, in order to avoid delay in treatment initiation, patients could be randomized 
on  the  basis  of  morphologic  diagnosis  only  and  before  the  results  of  genetic  tests  were  available.  A 
genetic diagnosis of APL was established by detection of the PML/RARA fusion gene by means of RT-PCR 
assay,  demonstration  of  the  t(15;17)  translocation  by  conventional  karyotyping  or  fluorescence  in  situ 
hybridization  (FISH),  or  evidence  of  a  microspeckled  PML  pattern  with  the  use  of  an  indirect 
immunofluorescence assay. 
Main exclusion criteria (published APL0406 study protocol) 
- Other active malignancy at time of study entry 
- Lack of diagnostic confirmation at genetic level 
- Significant arrhythmias 
- Neuropathy 
- Other cardiac contraindications for intensive chemotherapy (L-VEF <50%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 11/74 
 
  
  
- Uncontrolled, life-threatening infections 
- Severe non-controlled pulmonary or cardiac disease 
- Women who are either pregnant or breast feeding, or of child-bearing potential,  
- EKG abnormalities: congenital long QT syndrome; history or presence of significant ventricular or atrial 
tachyarrhythmia, clinically significant resting bradycardia (<50 beats per minute), QTc > 450 msec on 
screening EKG (using the QTcF formula), right bundle branch block plus left anterior hemiblock, 
bifascicular block. 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to the ATRA+ATO arm received ATRA 45 mg/m2 + ATO 0.15mg/kg daily until CR or 
up to a maximum of 60 days, followed by ATO 5 days/week (4 weeks on/4 weeks off for 4 courses) and 
ATRA (2 weeks on/2 weeks off for 7 courses).  
Patients randomized to the ATRA+chemotherapy arm received the standard ATRA+idarubicin regimen (45 
and  12  mg/m2,  respectively)  for  induction  therapy,  followed  by  3  cycles  of  anthracycline-based 
consolidation.  Patients  who  tested  negative  for  PML/RARA  by  RT-PCR  at  recovery  from  the  third 
consolidation cycle went on to receive maintenance therapy for up to 2 years consisting of methotrexate 
15  mg/m2  weekly,  6-mercaptopurine  50  mg/m2/day,  and  ATRA  45  mg/m2/day  for  15  days  every  3 
months (see Figure 1).

Supportive measures and management of complications  
In  study  APL0406,  prednisone  (0.5  mg/kg/day)  was  also  administered  from  day  1  until  the  end  of 
induction,  to  prevent  differentiation  syndrome  (DS).  In  case  DS  was  suspected,  a  switch  to 
dexamethasone was indicated. Hydroxyurea was permitted in patients who developed leucocytosis (WBC

EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 12/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
count  is  >  10  x109/L)  after  initiation  of  therapy.  Hydroxyurea  was  discontinued  when  WBC  count 
returned to <10 x109/L. 
At the earliest manifestations of suspected differentiation syndrome, ATRA, arsenic trioxide, or both were 
temporarily discontinued and intravenous dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 10 mg every 12 
hours until the disappearance of signs and symptoms for a minimum of 3 days. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  compare,  in  newly  diagnosed  APL  patients  treated  with  ATO  combined  to 
ATRA or receiving ATRA plus chemotherapy (AIDA regimen), the event-free survival (EFS) rate. 
Secondary objectives included the following: 
-  To  compare  complete  remission  (CR),  overall  survival  (OS)  and  Cumulative  incidence  of  relapse  (CIR) 
rates in the two arms 
- To compare the toxicity profile in the two arms 
- To compare the kinetics of MRD in the two arms 
- To compare the duration of patient hospitalisation in the two arms 
- To compare Quality of Life (QoL) between treatment arms 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  study  end  point  was  event-free  survival  at  2  years  after  diagnosis,  with  treatment  failure 
defined  as  any  of  the  following:  no  achievement  of  hematological  complete  remission  (HCR)  after 
induction therapy, no achievement of molecular complete remission (CRm) after 3 consolidation courses, 
molecular relapse, hematological relapse, or death. 
Hematologic  complete  remission  and  hematologic  (morphologic)  relapse  were  defined  according  to  the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) workshop definitions (Cheson et al. 2003).  
The  secondary  endpoints  were  to  compare:  the  rates  of  hematologic  complete  remission  (HCR)  after 
induction,  the  rates  of  OS  and  CIR  at  2  years,  both  OS  and  CIR  were  defined  according  to  the  IWG 
definitions,  the  incidence  of  haematological  and  non-haematological  toxicity  episodes  during  treatment 
(CTCAE  version  3)  ,  the  rate  of  molecular  remission  after  the  third  consolidation  cycle,  the  kinetics  of 
minimal  residual  disease  (PML/RARA  transcript  level  reduction  after  induction  and  during  consolidation),  
the  duration  of  patient  hospitalization  and  the  HR-QOL  at  end  of  the  induction  phase  and  at  end  of  the

Responses  were  defined  according  to  the  International  Working  Group  (IWG)  definitions  (Cheson  et  al. 
2003): 
- Hematologic CR (CR and CR with incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]) defined as:  
•  Complete remission (CR): <5% blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a 
count of at least 200 nucleated cells. There should be no blasts with Auer rods or persistence 
of  extramedullary  disease,  and  an  absolute  neutrophil  count  >1,000/µL  and  platelets  of 
Assessment report

100,000/µL. 
•  Morphological CRi: all the above criteria for CR except for residual neutropenia (˂1,000/µL) or 
thrombocytopenia (˂100,000/µL) 
-  Molecular  CR:  absence  of  PML/RARA  hybrid  transcript  by  reverse-transcriptase  polymerase  chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) in the bone marrow sample collected at the end of the third consolidation course (both 
groups), using RT-PCR assay with sensitivity comprised between 10-3 and 10-4 positive cells (Lo-Coco et 
al 1999). 
- Resistant disease: all patients who fail to achieve HCR and who do not die during the induction phase. 
-  Molecular  resistant  disease:  defined  as  the  persistence  of  the  PML/RARA  hybrid  transcript  in  bone 
marrow at the end of the third consolidation course. Molecular resistance should always be confirmed in 2 
consecutive  marrow  samples  taken  2  weeks  apart,  with  second  positivity  confirmed  by  a  national 
reference laboratory. 
- Induction deaths: all patients who die during the induction phase, before a CR has been demonstrated. 
Disease-free survival rate (DFS) was also recorded and defined as the time from achievement of HCR to 
relapse  (either  molecular  or  haematological),  persistence  of  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  positivity 
after consolidation therapy or death, which ever occurred first. Data on patients who were still alive and 
in first CRm were censored at the time of the most recent follow-up visit.  
Relapse was evaluated according to the following: 
- Haematological relapse: reappearance of ˃5% abnormal promyelocytes in the bone marrow at any time 
during follow-up, associated with RT-PCR positivity for the PML/RARA hybrid gene 
-  Molecular  relapse:  conversion  from  RT-PCR  negative  to  positive  for  the  PML/RARA  hybrid  gene  in  the 
bone marrow samples collected at any time after the third consolidation cycles, confirmed in 2 successive 
bone  marrow  samples  collected  2  weeks  apart  with  second  positivity  confirmed  by  a  national  reference 
laboratory, with a persistent morphologic HCR. 
- Extramedullary relapse: should be based on tissue diagnosis and/or liquor cytology in case a meningeal 
relapse. Extramedullary APL relapse should be genetically obtained by RT-PCR or anti-PML staining. 
Sample size 
A target sample of 162 patients was to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ATRA–arsenic trioxide or 
ATRA-chemotherapy. This sample size was calculated, according to the Farrington and Manning formulas 
(Farrington  et  Manning,1990)  to  achieve  92%  power  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  between  the  two 
groups for the primary efficacy endpoint (2-year event-free survival rate) with a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.05, assuming an expected event-free survival rate in the reference and experimental group of 85% 
and 95%, respectively. Additional assumptions included a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 5% and 
an expected rate of loss of 10%. 
After the enrolment completion of the original cohort, the study was expanded and restarted  “to reach an 
optimal compliance”  regarding QoL  evaluation which was a study secondary objective (Amendment 1 to 
Protocol). The sample size was increased to a new target of 276 patients with an additional cohort of 114 
patients  with the  aim  at  detecting  at  least  a  difference  of  10  points between treatment    arms     in     the   
“fatigue”   scale   of   the  EORTC  QLQ -C30.  Considering  a  two-sided  Mann-Whitney  test  with  alpha  
set  to  5%  and 80%  power  assuming  a  standard  deviation  of  23  points  on  the  “fatigue”  scale  
(based  on  similar  patients  reported  in  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30 reference value manual), 90 patients per 
arm were to be analysed. Assuming  a  missing  data  rate  of  35%,  then  the  target  overall  number  
of patients needed was set to 276 (138 per arm, i.e. further 57 per arm).

Randomisation 
Randomization  was  centralized  and  stratified  by  institution,  with  patients  randomized  in  a  1:1  ratio  to 
receive ATRA–arsenic trioxide or ATRA-chemotherapy.  
Blinding (masking) 
Study APL0406 was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
All  efficacy  analyses  were based  on the  intention-to-treat principle.  For  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  for 
noninferiority, a per-protocol analysis was also carried out. Noninferiority was assessed by estimating the 
two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  for  the  between-group  difference  in  crude  rates  of  2-year  EFS  and 
checking that the lower bound was not lower than −5%. The robustness of the results was confirmed by 
means  of  a  sensitivity  analysis  that  addressed  all  relevant  scenarios  for  the  patients  who  could  not  be 
evaluated, with the assumption of a poor outcome for all patients, a favorable outcome for all patients, or 
a poor outcome for patients in the ATRA–arsenic trioxide group and a favorable outcome for those in the 
ATRA–chemotherapy group.

Study APL0406: extended cohort  
Figure 2. Patient Disposition: Extended Cohort Study APL0406 
Recruitment 
Enrolment  of  the  pre-specified  162  patients  in  the  original  cohort  was  started in  October  2007  and  was 
completed  in  September  2010.  The  study  was  expanded  and  restarted  in  March  2011  to  increase  the 
accrual to a new target of 276 (original cohort + 114) patients, i.e. the extended cohort. Recruitment was 
completed  on  January  2013.  A  total  of  40  centres  from  the  Gruppo  Italiano  Malattie  Ematologiche 
dell’Adulto (GIMEMA) and 27 centres from the German–Austrian Acute MyeloidLeukemia Study Group and 
Study Alliance Leukemia participated in the study by enrollingat least one patient. 
Conduct of the study 
One  amendment  to  the  study  protocol  was  issued  on  December  2010,  in  order  to  increase  the  target 
accrual  from  162  to  276  subjects  (further  57  patients  per  arm)  to  reach  an  optimal  compliance  with 
Assessment report

respect to the QoL questionnaires. The observed compliance of 65% and of 55% at the end of induction 
and  at  the  end  of  the  third  consolidation  cycle,  respectively,  was  in  fact  lower  than  expected  and 
considered  insufficient  to  perform  the  planned  analysis  (QoL  was  a  secondary  endpoint  in  study 
APL0406). 
Baseline data 
Table 2: Demographic, Clinical, and Biological Characteristics of the Patients at Diagnosis 
(Study APL-0406)   
† A low risk level was defined as a white-cell count of no more than 10×109 per litre and a platelet count of more than 
40×109 per litre at presentation, and an intermediate risk level as a white-cell count of no more than 10×109 per litre 
and a platelet count of no more than 40×109 per litre at presentation. 
Numbers analysed 
Original cohort 
The original cohort comprised 162 patients with 159 randomized to treatment. The following analysis sets 
were identified: 
• 
Intent-to-treat  population:  The  ITT  analysis  set  included  all  treated  randomized  patients  (77 
patients randomized to ATRA+ATO and 79 to ATRA+chemotherapy).  
•  Modified ITT (mITT): 6 patients could not be evaluated at 24 months for the primary analysis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 18/74 
 
  
  
 
 
were  not  included  in  the  mITT  analysis  set  (74  patients  randomized  to  ATRA+ATO  and  76  to 
ATRA+chemotherapy).  
• 
Per-protocol  population:  the  per-protocol  analysis  set  included  patients  who  received  protocol 
treatment as scheduled (66 randomized to ATRA+ATO and 72 to ATRA+chemotherapy). The per-
protocol analysis was conducted for the primary efficacy analysis proving non-inferiority in terms 
of 2-year EFS. 
•  HR-QoL population: for the HR-QoL evaluation, of the 156 patients randomized, 150 were eligible 
at the end of induction therapy and 142 at the end of the third consolidation course. 
•  Safety  population:  The  safety  analysis  set  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
study treatment.  
Extended cohort 
The  extended  cohort  comprises  overall  276  patients:  266/276  patients  were  included  in  the  extended 
cohort ITT analysis set (129 randomized to ATRA+ATO and 137 to ATRA+chemotherapy). All analyses for 
the extended cohort used the ITT analysis set.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Induction Therapy 
A  total  of  77  patients  in  the  ATRA–arsenic  trioxide  group  and  79  patients  in  the  ATRA–chemotherapy 
group  could  be  evaluated  for  a  response  to  induction  therapy.  Hematologic  complete  remission  was 
achieved in all 77 patients in the ATRA–arsenic trioxide group (100%) and in 75 of the 79 patients in the 
ATRA–chemotherapy group (95%) (P = 0.12). The  median time to hematologic complete remission was 
32  days  (range,  22  to  68)  in  the  ATRA–arsenic  trioxide  group  and  35  days    (range,  26  to  63)  in  the 
ATRA–chemotherapy group (P = 0.61).  
Consolidation Therapy 
A total of 146 of 152 patients in hematologic complete remission proceeded to consolidation therapy.  
After  the  third  consolidation  cycle,  molecular  complete  remission  was  achieved  in  all  145  patients  who 
could be evaluated for a molecular response (75 in the ATRA–arsenic trioxide group and 70 in the ATRA–
chemotherapy  group).  Four  patients  in  the  ATRA–arsenic  trioxide  group  did  not  proceed  to  the  fourth 
consolidation cycle (2 declined to continue treatment and 2 had major protocol violations). Three patients 
in the ATRA–arsenic trioxide group did not complete the fourth consolidation course owing to withdrawal 
of consent, loss to follow-up, and the treating physician’s decision. 
Maintenance Therapy 
A  total  of  67  of  the  70  patients  who  completed  consolidation  therapy  in  the  ATRA–chemotherapy  group 
proceeded to maintenance therapy. Three patients went off protocol after consolidation therapy owing to 
withdrawal  of  consent,  a  major  protocol  violation,  and  a  toxic  effect.    Two  patients  did  not  complete 
maintenance therapy because of prolonged myelosuppression (>50 days).

Original cohort (median follow-up: 34.4 months): 
Of the 156 patients in the ITT analysis set, 150 (96%) could be evaluated for the primary endpoint and 
comprised  the  mITT  analysis  set.  Six  patients  could  not  be  evaluated  for  EFS  at  24  months  because  a 
molecular evaluation was not performed after the third consolidation cycle or follow-up was insufficient.  
The  2-year  EFS  rate  was  97%  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  and  86%  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group;  a 
difference of 11 percentage points between the treatment groups (95% CI: 2 to 22), p-value ˂0.001 for 
non-inferiority (see Figure below).

Original cohort (median follow-up: 53 months): 
After a median follow-up of 53 months, the EFS estimate at 50 months for the 156 patients of the original 
cohort in the ITT analysis was still statistically significant, being 96% for the ATRA+ATO group and 81% 
for the ATRA+chemotherapy group (p value 0.0034). 
Post-remission events in the ATRA+chemotherapy group included 6 relapses and 5 deaths in remission (1 
of which due to secondary leukaemia), while in the ATRA+ATO group there were 2 relapses and 1 death 
in remission, with no further events being recorded in this treatment group after the original publication. 
Extended cohort 
The median duration of follow-up for the last analysis was 40.6 months (range: 0.1-83.6 months). Of the 
266  patients  in  the  ITT  analysis  set,  209  (79%)  could  be  evaluated  for  the  primary  endpoint  (106  and 
103  in  the  ATRA+ATO  and  ATRA+CHT  arms,  respectively).  The  missing  patients  (n=57)  were  not 
evaluable due to lack of molecular evaluation after the third consolidation cycle or insufficient follow-up. 
For the 98 evaluable patients at 50 months (55 ATRA+ATO and 43 ATRA+chemotherapy), the 2 year EFS 
rate  was  98%  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  and  87%  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group;  a  difference  of  11 
percentage points between the treatment groups (p-value <0.0001). K-M curves are presented in Figure

Seventeen  patients  relapsed  during  follow-up.  Of  these,  2  relapses  occurred  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  at 
22 and 27 months from diagnosis, respectively, and 15 occurred in the ATRA+chemotherapy group at a 
median  time  of  14.0  months  (range:  2.5-39.8).  In  4  cases  relapse  as  detected  at  the  molecular  level 
before hematologic relapse leading to administration of pre-emptive salvage therapy. 
The kinetics of PML/RARA  transcript reduction after induction and consolidation therapy was assessed in 
63 unselected patients. No significant differences were seen between the treatment groups.  
Secondary endpoint: HR-QoL 
The  HR-QOL  analysis  was  reported  for  the  original  cohort  (see  Efficace  et  al.  2014).  Of  156  patients 
analyzed in the primary analysis, 150 were eligible for HR-QOL evaluation at end of induction therapy and 
142  at  end  of  third  consolidation  course.  Overall  compliance  with  HR-QOL  forms  was  80%.  After

induction,  115  HRQOL  forms  were  received  of  150  expected  (compliance,  77%),  whereas  after 
consolidation  phase,  119  forms  were  received  of  142  expected  (compliance,  84%).  No  statistically 
significant differences were found in compliance rates between treatment arms (data not shown). Patient 
characteristics  by  HRQOL  compliance  at  first  assessment  (i.e.,  end  of  induction  therapy)  are  listed  in 
Table below.

CIs between all-trans-retinoid acid and (ATRA) plus arsenic trioxide and ATRA plus 
chemotherapy arms at end of induction therapy and end of third consolidation 
course.  
Mean  fatigue  scores  of  patients  treated  with  ATRA+ATO  versus  those  treated  with  ATRA+chemotherapy 
were  29.1  (SD=25.7)  and  38.4  (SD=28.1),  respectively,  a  difference  of  9.3  (95%  CI:    17.8  to    0.7), 
reflecting a clinically relevant difference. After the third consolidation course, however, severity of fatigue 
was not significantly different between treatment groups (p-value 0.660).  
After  induction  therapy,  there  were  also  small  but  clinically  relevant  differences  in  severity  of 
nausea/vomiting,  difference  5.1  (95%  CI:    9.7  to  0.5);  appetite  loss  7.1  (95%  CI:    14.6  to  0.5);  and 
constipation 6.1 (95% CI:  16.3 to 4.0), favouring patients treated with ATRA+ATO versus those treated 
with ATRA+chemotherapy. With regard to functional aspects, clinically relevant (albeit small) differences 
favouring  patients  treated  with  ATRA+ATO  over  ATRA+chemotherapy  were  observed  for  physical  5.3 
(95% CI:  1.9 to 12.4) and cognitive functioning 5.9 (95% CI:  1.2 to 12.9). 
After third consolidation course, only severity of diarrhoea showed a small clinically relevant difference of 
5.5 (95% CI:  0.4 to 10.6), favouring patients treated with ATRA+chemotherapy over those treated with 
ATRA+ATO.  For  all  other  symptoms  and  functional  scales,  the  magnitude  of  estimated  mean  score 
differences between treatment groups was trivial. 
Mean  observed  HRQOL  scores  after  induction  were  compared  between  patients  who  returned  the 
questionnaire  after  consolidation  therapy  and  those  who  did  not,  and  no  statistically  significant 
differences 
were  found  between  groups  (data  not  shown).  Univariablelogistic  regression  analysis  showed  that  the 
missing  data  mechanismwas  independent  of  age,  risk  level,  haemoglobin,  time  from  diagnosis,and

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Meta-analysis of ATRA+ATO versus ATRA Monotherapy 
A  meta-analysis  was  conducted  to  compare  the  effects  of  the  combination  therapy  of  ATRA+ATO  with 
ATRA monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed APL (Ma and Yang 2015).  
Methods 
The  studies  were  retrieved  from  PubMed,  EMBASE,  Cochrane  Library,  ChinaInfo  and  China  National 
Knowledge  Infrastructure  databases  from  the  inception  to  20  June  2014.  Eligible  studies  were  selected 
based on the predefined criteria, and the literature quality was independently assessed by 2 investigators 
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
The following criteria were required for inclusion in the meta-analysis: 
•  Study was a randomized controlled trial or a prospective controlled clinical trial 
•  Participants of the study were patients with newly diagnosed APL 
•  ATO  +  ATRA  combination  therapy  was  designated  as  the  experimental  group,  while  the  ATRA 
monotherapy was used for the control group 
•  Study  reported  symptoms  of  CR,  early  mortality,  relapse,  dryness  of  mouth,  liver  dysfunction, 
skin reaction or gastrointestinal reaction. 
In contrast, studies were excluded if:  
•  They were retrospective studies 
•  The study did not provide complete data to be statistically analyzed 
• 
• 
the participants of the study were patients with recurrence of APL 
the study was a literature review, comment or other nonpublication report 
The pooled effect size was relative risk (RR) and its 95% CI. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed 
by Cochran’s Q and the I2 statistic test, and p < 0.05 or I2> 50% was considered to be heterogeneous; 
when heterogeneity was detected, the random effects model was selected to calculate the summary RRs 
and  their  95%  CIs  using  the  method  of  DerSimonian  and  Laird.  Otherwise,  the  fixed  effects  model  with 
the  inverse  variance  method  was  applied  to  calculate  the  pooled  effect  size.  Publication  bias  was 
examined by a funnel plot. 
Results 
A  total  of  1934  articles  were  identified  in  the  initial  search  after  removing  duplicate  articles.  No 
publication bias was noted. Overall, a total of 8 articles containing 480 cases were included, among which 
264  were  assigned  to  the  ATRA+ATO  group  and  the  other  216  to  the  ATRA  group  (see  Figure  10  and 
Table 9).

The  meta-analysis  showed  that  ATRA+ATO  combination  therapy  significantly  improved  the  CR  rate  with 
RR of 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.16), p-value 0.004; decreased the early mortality rate, RR of 0.42, (95% 
CI: 0.20 to 0.91) p-value); and relapse rate (RR) of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.42) p-value <0.0001) (see

Systematic literature review 
Methods 
A systematic literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying all published clinical studies 
in  first-line  APL,  where  ATO  was  included  in  any  phase  of  the  treatment  regimen.  The  search  was 
conducted in October 2015 using the Ovid interface to search Medline, Embase and Cochrane. The search 
was  restricted  to  English  language  and  studies  published  after  1st  January  2005.  Conference  abstracts 
that  were  published  in  a  form  that  was  accessible  using  the  search  engines  below  were  included; 
individual conference websites were not searched separately. 
The employed inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarised in Table below:

Table 10: Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Results 
After removing 26 duplicates, a total of 456 references were identified from the literature search.  
Following  the  initial  screening  350  publications  did  not  meet  the  pre-specified  inclusion  criteria.  Of  the 
106  potentially  relevant  full  text  articles  (and  abstracts)  that  underwent  further  screening,  74  were 
selected for data extraction. The figure below displays the number of studies excluded at each step and 
the reasons for exclusion.

Figure 12: Flow diagram of publication selection process 
The 74 extracted studies were assessed for their patient inclusion criteria. They consisted of both single-
arm studies and controlled studies. The controlled studies included randomized controlled cohorts as well 
as retrospective or prospective cohorts. The majority studies included a mix of high and low risk patient, 
and sometimes both adults and children were treated in the same study. One subgroup was identified and 
analysed separately in the results: studies only including children (n=8).Five efficacy endpoints of interest 
were captured in the systematic literature review: OS, CR, EFS, DFS and CIR. 
Studies without Chemotherapy in Any Treatment Phase 
Twenty-eight  of  the  33  studies  without  chemotherapy  provided  at  least  one  efficacy  endpoint.  On  the

whole,  studies  using  a  combination  regimen  of  ATO  +  ATRA  had  better  outcomes  than  those  with  ATO 
alone.  Studies  with  only  ATO  in  the  treatment  regimen  reported  five-year  OS ranging  64.4% to  83.9%, 
while  studies  with  ATO  and  ATRA  combination  reported  five-year  OS  ranging  from  88.0%  to  100%.  CR 
after induction ranged from 50.0% to 92.0% for studies using ATO alone, compared to 89.0% to 100% 
for the combination arms. Lastly, five-year EFS ranged from 68-0% to 75.0% for ATO alone studies, and 
increased to 86.0% to 94.1% in combination therapy studies. 
Studies with Chemotherapy in Any Treatment Phase 
Thirty-seven of the 41 studies without chemotherapy provided at least one efficacy endpoint. On the 
whole,  patients  using  ATO  at  any  point  in  the  treatment  regimen  had  better  outcomes  than  those 
treatment arms without ATO. Studies with an  ATO-containing regimen reported 5-year OS ranging from 
64.7%  to  100%,  while  studies  without  an  ATO-containing  regimen  reported  five-year  OS  ranging  from 
45.0% to 100%. CR after induction ranged from 80.0% to 100% for regimens containing ATO, compared 
to  57.0%  to  100%  for  those  without  ATO.  Lastly,  five-year  DFS  ranged  from  86.6%  to  100%  for  ATO-
containing regimens, and decreased to 64.8% to 100% in non ATO containing regimens. 
Studies with Paediatric Patients 
All  eight  studies  with  only  paediatric  patients  provided  at  least  one  efficacy  endpoint.  On  the  whole, 
paediatric  patients  using  ATO  at  any  point  in  the  treatment  regimen  had  better  outcomes  than  those 
treatment  arms  without  ATO.  Paediatric  studies  with  an  ATO-containing  regimen  reported  five-year  OS 
ranging  from  83.9%  to  100%,  while  studies  without  an  ATO-containing  regimen  reported  five-year  OS 
ranging  from  73.3%  to  91.8%.  CR  after  induction  ranged  from  80.0%  to  100%  for  paediatric  regimens 
containing ATO, compared to 93.3% to 95.3% for those without ATO. Five-year EFS ranged from 72.7% 
to  94.1%  for  ATO-containing  paediatric  regimens,  and  decreased  to  60.0%  to  76.2%  in  non  ATO-
containing  paediatric  regimens.  Lastly,  five-year  DFS  ranged  from  94.4%  to  100%  for  ATO-containing 
paediatric regimens, and decreased to 64.8% to 80.2% in non ATO-containing paediatric regimens. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No clinical study specifically conducted in special populations was submitted.  
Elderly Subjects 
Age is a significant prognostic factor in APL (De la  Serna et al 2008). Both studies APL0406 and AML17 
included  newly  diagnosed  low-  to  intermediate-risk  patients  with  APL  who  were  >  60  years  of  age  at 
study enrolment. While no formal comparisons were performed for elderly subjects between studies, each 
study reported similar results in patients who were ≤ 60 years of age with those who were >60 years of 
age.  
Enrolment  in  Study  APL0406  was  limited  to  patients  <71  years  of  age.  A  total  of  35  patients  were 
between 60.1 and 70.2 years of age. Of these, 16 patients were assigned to receive ATRA+ATO, and 19 
were  assigned  to  receive  ATRA+chemotherapy.  There  were  no  significant  between-group  differences  in 
the main presenting features (age, WBC and platelet counts, fibrinogen level, and coagulopathy). The 2 
year  EFS  rates  were  100%  in  the  group  receiving  ATRA+ATO  and  84%  in  the  group  receiving 
ATRA+chemotherapy (p-value 0.40).  
Study AML17 included 49 patients aged between 60 and 77 years (37 low-risk and 12 high-risk patients). 
Of these patients, 25 received ATRA+ATO and 24 received ATRA+chemotherapy. The 4 year survival did 
not differ significantly between the treatment groups: 80% (95% CI: 58 to 91) in the ATRA+ATO group, 
compared with 74% (95% CI: 50 to 87) in the ATRA+chemotherapy group (see Figure 8).

Supportive studies 
UK NCRI AML17  
The  trial  was  a  phase  III,  randomized,  open-label  study  to  compare  ATRA-ATO  versus  AIDA  (all-trans 
retinoic acid + idarubicin) treatment. This study was a multicenter study with 81 centers and 235 patients 
randomised, of which 57 were at high risk (WBC count at diagnosis of > 10*109/L) (Burnett et al. 2015).  
The main inclusion criteria were: patients (≥16 years) with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, confirmed by 
the  presence  of  the  PML-RAR  transcript  and  without  significant  cardiac  or  pulmonary  comorbidities  or 
active malignancy, and who were not pregnant or breastfeeding. 
This trial included patients with high risk and had less frequent arsenic dosing (63 doses within 6 months) 
compared to the previous trial APL0406.  
In this study, the bone marrow was monitored for the fusion gene, there was no maintenance treatment 
for patients.  
Patients allocated to the ATRA and idarubicin group received four courses of treatment. ATRA 45 mg/m2 
daily was given in an oral divided dose (in two equal doses per day) for up to 60 days as part of their first 
course,  and  then  at  the  same  dose  (45  mg/m2  as  an  oral  divided  dose)  on  days  1–15  of  subsequent 
courses. Chemotherapy was idarubicin 12 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 of course 1 and 5 
mg/m2  on  days  1–4  of  course  2;  mitoxantrone  10  mg/m2  on  days  1–4  of  course  3;  and  idarubicin  12 
mg/m2  on  day  1  of  course  4.  In  the  ATRA  and  arsenic  trioxide  group,  patients  received  five  courses  of 
treatment:  ATRA  was  given  at  the  same  dose  as  in  the  other  group  (45  mg/m2  daily  in  an  oral  divided 
dose) on days 1–60 of course 1 or until remission, and at the same dose on days 1–14 and 29–42 in 
courses 2–4, and days 1 14 of course 5. Arsenic trioxide was given intravenously at a dose of 0,3 mg/kg

on days 1–5 of each course, and then in weeks 2–8 of course 1 and weeks 2–4 of courses 2–5 at 0,25 
mg/kg twice weekly.  
High-risk  patients  (≥10*109  cells  per  L  at  diagnosis)  could  receive  an  initial  dose  of  gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin (GO). 
The  primary  endpoint  was  quality  of  life  (EORTC  QLQ-C30).  Secondary  outcomes  were  overall  survival, 
relapse-free  survival  and  event-free  survival,  and  the  incidence  of  relapse  (both  morphological  and 
molecular),  death  without  relapse,  and  treatment-related  myelodysplastic  syndrome  or  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia. 
Results  are  based  on  a  median  follow  up  of  30.5  months.  Considering  the  total  population  (low  to  high 
risk disease which is not exactly the proposed indication for marketing authorization), data showed that: 
•  Difference no significative between the treatment groups  in terms of quality of life ; 
•  CR 94% with ATRA+ATO compared with 89% with AIDA (OR=0,54 [0,21 ; 1,34], p=0,18); 
•  60 day mortality was half than standard of care with 9% for AIDA compared to 5% for ATRA+ATO 
(HR=0,55 [0,21 ; 1,43], p=0,22); 
•  4  year  OS  showed  a  noteworthy  difference  of  93%  of  ATRA-ATO  compared  with  89%  for  AIDA, 
but was not statistically significant (p=0,25); 
•  4  year  cumulative  incidence  of  molecular  relapse,  was  27%  with  AIDA  compared  to  0%  with 
ATRA+ATO (HR=0,12 [0,05 ; 0,30], p<0,0001); 
•  4  year  EFS  show  a  significant  difference  of  91%  for  ATRA-ATO  compared  with  70%  for  AIDA, 
(HR=0,35 [0,18 ; 0,68], p=0,002); 
In  the  low-  to  intermediate-risk  patients,  4-year  event-free  survival  was  92%  (95%  CI  [84;97]  in  the 
ATRA  and  arsenic  trioxide  group  vs  71%  [55– 83]  in  the  ATRA  and  idarubicin  group  (HR=0,34  ;  95%CI 
[0,15  ;  0,75],  p=0,008)  and  4-year  OS  was  95%  (95%  CI  [86  – 98])  in  the  ATRA  and  arsenic  trioxide 
group  versus  90%  (95%  CI  [81– 95])  in  the  ATRA  and  idarubicin  group  (HR=0,47  ;  95%  CI  [0,16  ; 
1.39]).
Supportive care requirements were significantly lower during the first two courses of treatment for ATRA 
and arsenic trioxide than for ATRA and idarubicin on all measures except for antibiotic use in course 2. 
Systematic  literature  review  of  clinical  data  for  Trisenox  in  acute  promyelocytic  leukemia 
(APL) 
A systematic literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying all published clinical studies 
in  first-line  APL,  where  ATO  was  included  in  any  phase  of  the  treatment  regimen.  The  search  was 
conducted in October 2015 using the Ovid interface to search Medline, Embase and Cochrane. The search 
was restricted to English language and studies published after January 1, 2005. Conference abstracts that 
were  published  in  a  form  that  was  accessible  using  the  search  engines  below  were  included;  individual 
conference websites were not searched separately. 
Out  of  the  456  identified  references,  74  ultimately  met  the  pre-specified  inclusion  criteria  and  were 
selected  for  data  extraction.  These  studies  consisted  of  both  single-arm  studies  and  controlled  studies. 
The controlled studies included randomized controlled trials as well as retrospective or prospective multi-
arm  cohorts.  The  majority  included  a  mix  of  high  and  low  risk  patients,  as  well  as  a  mix  of  adults  and 
children. 
The  studies  with  at  least  1  treatment  arm  that  did  not  include  chemotherapy  as  part  of  the  treatment 
regimen  were  discussed  separately  from  those  that  did  include  chemotherapy.  Some  of  the  studies

without  chemotherapy  in  at  least  1  arm  did  allow  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  or  another  chemotherapy  if 
patient’s WBC rose above a certain threshold. 
The table below presents a summary of the efficacy results for the studies identified that utilized ATO in a 
chemotherapy free regimen (the publications of the APL0406 and AML17 studies have not been included). 
Only  those  publications  reporting  efficacy  results  are  included  in  the  table.  Those  studies  available  from 
abstracts rather than full papers are shown italicized. Where it has been possible to identify, follow-ups of 
the  same  study  are  presented  sequentially,  otherwise  the  data  are  presented  alphabetically  by  year  of 
publication.

Mathews and al (2006) and Ghavamzadeh and al (2006) relied almost exclusively on ATO monotherapy 
for both induction and consolidation/maintenance, although patients with high WBC count were also given 
hydroxyurea.  A  CR  rate  of  86%  was  achieved  by  both  groups,  and  3-year  OS  of  86%  to  87%  was 
reported in both studies. Further follow-up reported a 5-year OS of 74% (Mathews and al 2010a). In the 
study  by  Ghavamzadeh,  newly  diagnosed  patients  were  treated  with  only  2  cycles  of  single-agent  ATO, 
leading  to  a  DFS  at  2  years  of  only  63.7%.  This  led  to  the  conclusion  that  2  cycles  were  not  enough 
therapy. Further follow-up reported at 5 years OS at 64% (Ghavamzadeh and al 2011). While the results 
of single-agent ATO were deemed to be acceptable in patients with low to intermediate risk APL, high risk 
patients  did  considerably  worse  in  both  studies.  A  study  in  Iran  reported  a  CR  rate  of  100%  and  72% 
chance  of  survival  a  median  follow-up  of  28  months  (Alimoghaddam  and  al  2006).  The  lowest  CR  rate 
observed  (50%)  was  reported  for  a  sample  of  only  4  patients  in  a  case  review  of  33  patients.  The 
publication did not provide sufficient detail for further review of these patients (Bajpai and al 2011). 
Building  on  preclinical  data  showing  synergy  of  ATRA  and  ATO  in  vitro,  studies  combining  the  2  agents 
with  or  without  chemotherapy  were  undertaken.  The  majority  of  these  studies  was  Phase  2  studies  and 
included  chemotherapy  in  the  treatment  schedules.  The  estimated  10-year  OS  for  ATRA+ATO  was  69% 
following database review (Eghtedar and al 2015). Further studies that stratified patients by risk groups

showed that ATRA+ATO-based induction and consolidation therapy were effective in patients with low- to 
intermediate-risk  APL  with  a  CR  rate  of  96%  and  long-term  outcomes,  despite  the  omission  of 
chemotherapy from both induction and consolidation phases (Estey and al 2006, Ravandi and al 2010b). 
High risk patients (WBC ˃10x109/L at initial presentation) had inferior outcomes on this study, despite the 
addition of idarubicin or gemtuzumab ozogamicin during induction. 
Single agent ATO has also been studied in newly diagnosed APL patients aged ≥ 60 (Zhang and al 2013), 
and children aged ≤ 15 years (Zhou and al 2010), with similar high CR rates and durable remissions. 
Overall, these studies showed significant improvement in survival, although the early death rate remained 
high (6% to 11%) as well as 2-year relapse rate (8% to 12%). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has mainly provided results taken from the study APL0406 and the study AML17. 
No  formal  dose-response  study  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  optimal  dose  and  schedule  for  ATO 
when  used  in  combination  with  ATRA.  Different  doses  and  schedules  of  ATRA  and  ATO  have  been 
investigated  so  far  in  several  independent  clinical  trials.  However,  with  all  the  limitations  of  indirect 
comparisons,  it  is  acknowledged  that  no  significant  differences  in  terms  of  efficacy  outcomes  were 
observed. The ATO dose and schedule employed in study APL0406 are similar to those already approved 
for  the  treatment  of  relapsed/refractory  patients.  The  minor  changes  introduced  in  the  ATO  regimen  in 
this study (mainly in terms of max. treatment duration during induction and consolidation) were made to 
adapt the use of ATO to a first-line regimen that included ATRA.  
Supportive study AML17 was an open label, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study designed to compare 
the  efficacy  and  safety  of  ATRA-ATO  with  ATRA+chemotherapy  (the  AIDA  regimen).  The  APL  study  was 
part of a larger study in patients with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). With respect 
to study design, significant differences were observed between study AML17 and pivotal study APL0406. 
In terms of patient population, patients aged ≥ 16 years could be enrolled in study AML17, and no upper 
age limit was pre specified. More importantly, high risk APL patients were also accepted. 
The ATRA-ATO regimen administered in study AML17 significantly differed from the one employed in the 
pivotal  trial  (i.e.  ATO  was  administered  at  a  higher  dose  [0.3  mg/kg  daily]  for  the  first  5  days  of  each 
course,  followed  by  a  twice  weekly  regimen  at  a  lower  dose  [0.25  mg/kg]).  Significant  differences 
compared  to  study  APL0406  were  also  observed  in  the  control  arm  (i.e.  no  maintenance  phase  was 
planned). Furthermore, high-risk patients could also receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  original  cohort  of  the  study  APL0406,  complete  remission  was  achieved  in  all  77  patients  in  the 
ATRA– arsenic  trioxide  group  who  could  be  evaluated  (100%)  and  in  75  of  79  patients  in  the  ATRA–
chemotherapy  group  (95%)  (P  =  0.12).  The  median  follow-up  was  34.4  months.  Two-year  EFS  rates 
were 97% in the ATRA– arsenic trioxide group and 86% in the ATRA– chemotherapy group (95% CI for 
the  difference,  2  to  22  percentage  points;  p<0.001  for  no  inferiority  and  p  =  0.02  for  superiority  of 
ATRA– arsenic  trioxide).  Two-year  OS  probability  was  99%  (95%  CI:  96-100)  in  the  ATRA–arsenic 
trioxide group and 91% (95% CI: 85-97) in the ATRA–chemotherapy group (p = 0.02). 
Health-related  quality-of-life  (secondary  endpoint)  was  assessed  after  induction  therapy  and  third 
consolidation  course.  A  difference  favouring  patients  treated  with  ATRA  +  ATO  was  found  for  fatigue

severity  (mean  score  difference,  -9.3;  95%  CI,  -17.8  to  -0.7;  p  =  .034)  at  end  of  induction  therapy. 
HRQOL  differences  between  treatment  arms  at  end  of  consolidation  showed  that  for  several  scales, 
differences between treatment arms were marginal. 
In the extended cohort of APL0406 study, all 4 efficacy endpoints showed significant difference between 
the  treatment  groups  favouring  ATRA+ATO  over  ATRA+chemotherapy  at  both  24  months  and  at  50 
months  for  those  evaluable.  The  2-year  EFS  rate  was  98%  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  and  87%  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group;  a  difference  of  11  percentage  points  between  the  treatment  groups  (p= 
<0.0001). The 2-year OS rates were 99% in the ATRA+ATO group and 95% in the ATRA+chemotherapy 
group,  2-year  DFS  rates  were  98%  and  89%  (p=0.0003)  and  2-year  CIR  rates  were  0.9%  and  8.2% 
(p=0.0013).  The  5-year  OS  rates  were  99% 
in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  and  93% 
in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (p=0.0073),  5-year  DFS  rates  were  97%  and  83%  (p=  0.0003)  and 5-year 
CIR rates were 1.9% and 14% (p= 0.0013). 
In  the  study  AML17,  in  the  low-  to  intermediate-risk  subgroup  corresponding  to  the  proposed indication 
for marketing authorization, even though the primary objective of this supportive study was not reached, 
the  EFS  as  a  secondary  objective  showed  a  significant  improvement  with  the  ATRA-ATO  combination. 
Indeed, 4-year EFS was 92% (95% CI: 84-97 in the ATRA and arsenic trioxide group vs 71% [95% CI: 
55-83] in the ATRA and idarubicin group (HR=0,34 ; 95%CI: 0,15 -0,75), p=0,008). The 4-year OS was 
95%  (95%  CI:  86  -  98)  in  the  ATRA  and  arsenic  trioxide  group  versus  90%  (95%  CI:  81– 95)  in  the 
ATRA and idarubicin group (HR=0,47 ; 95% CI: 0,16-1.39). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the efficacy data demonstrated a clinical and statistical non-inferiority of ATRA/ATO combination 
therapy  versus  the  active  comparator  (ATRA-chemotherapy  combination),  showing  a  clear  benefit  of 
ATRA/ATO combination therapy in the treatment of patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL. The use of 
ATRA/ATO is associated with a similar rate of complete remission allowing the patients to go through the 
consolidation phase. These results are considered of important clinical relevance. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH has submitted an application based on the analysis of safety of data obtained from: 
•  Study APL0406 
•  Study AML17  
•  A literature review 
• 
Post-marketing safety data 
In  Study  APL0406  all  AEs,  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs),  SAEs  and  serious  unexpected  adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) were recorded during the treatment period. No long-term safety data were collected. 
The protocol stated that AEs were defined in accordance with the GCP definitions (2001/20/EC). A full list 
of  reported  SAEs  has  been  disclosed  in  the  publication  of  the  extended  cohort  study  (Platzbecker  et  al 
2016).  According  to  the  protocol  for  Study  APL0406,  during  the  induction  and  consolidation  phases 
regular  tests  for  serum  chemistry  were  made including  liver  enzymes,  electrolytes,  glycaemia  and  renal 
function tests, as well as ECG. After the last consolidation cycle, neither further biochemistry testing nor 
ECC were done. Only regular blood counts and bone marrow aspirates were performed. Results of Grade 
3  or  4  neutropenia,  Grade  3  or  4 
thrombocytopenia,

hypertriglyceridemia at induction and after each consolidation cycle have been disclosed in the publication 
of the extended cohort (Platzbecker et al 2016). For the original cohort the only results disclosed were a 
comparison  of  the  incidence  of  hematological  and  non-hematological  toxicity  episodes  during  treatment 
(National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE grading Version 
3.0) which was a secondary endpoint of the study.  
The primary objective of Study AML17 was to compare QOL and toxicity and resource usage of patients 
receiving the ATRA+chemotherapy compared with ATRA+ATO. No spontaneous reporting of any AEs was 
done  and  no  routine  biochemistry  testing  was  prespecified.  Grading  of  following  limited  list  of  AEs  was 
done after course 1 and 2: nausea; vomiting; alopecia; oral symptoms; diarrhea; cardiac function; liver 
function  AST,  ALT  and  bilirubin;  renal  function  creatinine;  proteinuria;  hematuria;  and  sensory 
neuropathy.  Likewise,  AEs  of  special  interest  were  checked  for  presence:  QTc  prolongation,  other 
arrhythmias,  sensory  neuropathy,  differentiation  syndrome,  tumor  lysis  syndrome,  peak  WBC,  and 
secondary leukemias.  
Patient exposure 
Study APL0406 
The original cohort of study APL0406 comprised a total of 162 patients recruited to September 2010 (6 of 
these patients were recruited but not treated) initially published with a median 34-month follow-up (Lo-
Coco et al 2013a) and then with a median 53-month follow-up (Lo-Coco et al 2015).  
An  additional  cohort  of  114  patients  was  enrolled  under  the  same  protocol  (recruited  to  January  2013). 
Results for the extended cohort, which comprises 276 patients (162+114) were initially published with a 
median  follow-up  of  36  months  (Platzbecker  et  al  2014)  and  then  with  median  40.6  months  follow-up 
(Platzbecker et al 2016). 
Overall, across the original and extended cohorts, 129 patients were treated with the ATRA-ATO regimen 
in study APL0496 
Study AML17 
A total of 235 patients with APL were randomized in study AML17 and 116 patients were allocated to the 
ATRA-ATO arm. However, only 115/116 (99%) patients received the allocated treatment in course 1. One 
patient assigned to ATRA-ATO received ATRA+chemotherapy because of prolonged QT interval. 
Results  have  been  published  with  a  median  30.5-month  follow-up  (Burnett  et  al  2015).  Twenty-eight of 
the  30  high-risk  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  also  received  gemtuzumab  ozogamicin  (the  other  2 
high-risk patients were given an anthracycline as there was no gemtuzumab ozogamicin available at their 
site pharmacy) and 7 low- or intermediate- risk patients were given gemtuzumab ozogamicin for a rising 
WBC count. 
Expected ATO exposure 
In  the  currently  approved  Trisenox  SmPC  for  treatment  of  relapsed/refractory  APL,  the  recommended 
dose for ATO in induction is 0.15 mg/kg daily until remission or day 50, followed by consolidation (using 
the same dose) for 5 days per week for a maximum of 5 weeks (total of 25 days).  
This equates to a maximum cumulative dose of 11.3 mg/kg. 
The  ATRA-ATO  regimen  for  newly  diagnosed  patients  as  used  in  the  APL0406  study  involved  induction 
treatment with 0.15 mg/kg/day ATO and 45 mg/m2 ATRA until CR or up to a maximum of 60 days. This is 
followed by consolidation treatment (using the same doses) for 5 days a week, 4 weeks on and 4 weeks 
off,  for  a  maximum  of  4  cycles  (i.e.,  80  days).  Therefore,  the  maximum  exposure  to  ATO  treatment  in 
this study was 140 days at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg (i.e., maximum cumulative exposure of 21 mg/kg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 42/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The AML17 study used a different dosing schedule. For patients in the ATRA-ATO group, the first course 
comprised ATRA 45 mg/m2 until remission or day 60, and ATO at 0.3 mg/kg on day 1-5, and then at 0.25 
mg/kg twice weekly in weeks 2-8. For courses 2 to 5, the same regimen of ATRA was used (45 mg/m2 on 
days 1-15) and the same dose of ATO was given but treatment stopped at week 4 (rather than week 8). 
The  maximum  cumulative  exposure  for  ATO  in  this  study  is  25  days  at  0.3  mg/kg  and  38  days  at  0.25 
mg/kg (i.e., maximum cumulative dose of 17 mg/kg). This equates to a maximum exposure for 113 days 
at the dose of 0.15 mg/kg. 
The  proposed  regimen  for  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  APL  is  the  same  dose  regimen  as  used  in  the 
APL0406 study. 
Adverse events 
In  study  APL0406  a  comparison  of  the  incidence  of  haematological  and  non-haematological  toxicity 
episodes  during  treatment  (NCI-CTCAE  grading,  version  3.0)  was  a  secondary  endpoint  of  the  study. 
Adverse  events  (AEs)  were  defined  in  accordance  with  the  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP)  definitions 
(2001/20/EC). Adverse events and/or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were recorded according to the NCI 
CTCAE, version 3.0. 
In Study AML17, after course 1 and 2, only a grading of the following AEs was done: nausea; vomiting; 
alopecia;  oral  symptoms;  diarrhoea;  cardiac  function;  liver  function  (aspartate  transaminase  [AST], 
alanine  transaminase  [ALT]  and  bilirubin);  renal  function  creatinine;  proteinuria;  haematuria;  and 
sensory  neuropathy.  After  course  1  and  2,  the  following  AEs  of  special  interest  were  also  checked  for 
presence:  QTc  prolongation,  other  arrhythmias,  sensory  neuropathy,  differentiation  syndrome,  tumour 
lysis  syndrome,  peak  white  blood  cells  (WBC),  secondary  leukaemia’s.  No  spontaneous  reporting  of  any 
AEs was done. Toxicity was recorded using the NCI-CTCAE version 3.0. 
Non-haematological toxicities in study APL0406 are summarised in Table 12.

Deaths 
Study APL0406 
In  the  original  cohort  of  study  APL0406  with  34-month  follow-up  (n=156  patients),  there  were  fewer 
deaths  reported  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  overall  than  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (1  vs.  7).  One 
patient in the ATRA-ATO group died from bronchopneumonia associated with H1N1 virus infection during 
consolidation  therapy  (Lo-Coco  2013).  With  the  extended  follow-up  period  (median  53  month)  no 
additional deaths were reported in the ATRA-ATO group (Lo-Coco 2015).  
In  the  ATRO+chemotherapy  group,  4  patients  died  during  induction  therapy  (2  from  the  differentiation 
syndrome,  1  from  ischemic  stroke,  and  1  from  bronchopneumonia)  and  3  patients  died  during 
consolidation  therapy  (1  each  from  haemorrhagic  shock,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  bronchopneumonia) 
(Lo-Coco  2013).  With  the  extended  follow-up  period,  post-remission  events  reported  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group included 5 deaths in remission (1 of which was due to secondary leukaemia) 
(Lo-Coco 2015). 
In the extended cohort study, no additional deaths were reported in the induction phase in either of the 
of the treatment arms (Platzbecker et al 2016). Likewise, no additional deaths in remission were reported 
compared with the original cohort. This was maintained after a median follow-up of 40.6 months (n=266 
patients).  The  number  of  deaths  in  remission  therefore  was  1  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  (due  to  H1N1 
bronchopneumonia)  and  5  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (1  due  to  haemorrhagic  shock,  1  to 
pulmonary embolism, 2 to bronchopneumonia, 1 to secondary leukaemia). 
Overall,  9  SAEs  with  a  fatal  outcome  were  reported  for  the extended  cohort  (1  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group 
and  8  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group).  The  patient  who  died  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  had  a  SAE  of 
pneumonia, which was considered unrelated to either study treatment.  
In the ATRA+chemotherapy group, 7 of the 9 patients who died had fatal SAEs reported (1 death due to 
bronchopneumonia and the death due to secondary MDS were not reported as SAEs):  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
1 case of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to ATRA and idarubicin 
1 case of respiratory failure and retinoic acid syndrome related to ATRA and idarubicin 
1 case of ischemic stroke related to ATRA and idarubicin 
1 case of bronchopneumonia considered related to ATRA 
1 case of bronchopneumonia considered related to methotrexate 
1 case of haemorrhagic shock considered unrelated to study treatment 
1 case of pulmonary embolism considered unrelated to study treatment. 
Other significant events 
Differentiation syndrome 
APL  differentiation  syndrome  is  also  a  well-known  side  effect  of  ATO,  as  indicated  in  the  current  SmPC 
(which  reports  that  27%  of  patients  treated  with  ATO  have  experienced  symptoms  similar  to  the  APL 
differentiation  syndrome).  The  SmPC  of  ATRA  (Vesanoid)  also  reports  that  differentiation  syndrome  has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 51/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been reported in APL patients in up to 25% in some centres.  
Study APL0406 
In  the  original  cohort  of  the  APL0406  study,  differentiation  syndrome,  including  moderate  and  severe 
forms,  developed  in  15  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  (19%)  and  in  13  patients  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group (16%, p-value 0.62). Severe differentiation syndrome occurred in 10 patients 
(5% to 6% in each group, p-value 0.99) and was fatal in 2 patients assigned to ATRA+chemotherapy (Lo-
Coco et al 2013a).  
In  the  extended  cohort  moderate  and  severe  differentiation  syndrome  was  reported  in  16  (13%)  and  5 
(4%)  patients,  respectively,  in  ATRA-ATO  group,  and  in  9  (7%)  and  8  (6%)  patients  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group (p-value 0.38). There were 2 fatal cases in the ATRA+chemotherapy group; 
these  patients  were  in  the  original  cohort  also.  In  addition  there  were  4  cases  of  indeterminate 
differentiation syndrome in each group (Platzbecker et al 2016). 
In the APL0406 study, during the induction phase all patients received prophylactic treatment to prevent 
differentiation  syndrome  with  prednisone,  0.5  mg/kg/day  from  day  1  until  the  end  of  induction.  At  the 
earliest manifestations of suspected differentiation syndrome (e.g., unexplained respiratory distress), and 
prior  to  development  of  a  fulminant  syndrome,  the  following  measures  were  to  be  immediately 
undertaken: 
• temporary discontinuation of ATRA-ATO treatment. 
•prompt  initiation  of  dexamethasone  10  mg  intravenously  (IV)  12-hourly  until  disappearance  of 
symptoms and signs, and for a minimum of 3 days. 
•furosemide when clinically required. 
As soon as the signs and symptoms had resolved, treatment with ATRA and/or ATO was to be resumed at 
50%  of  the  previous  dose  during  the  first  7  days  in  APL0406  (4  days  in  AML17).  Thereafter,  in  the 
absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, ATRA and/or ATO was to be resumed at full dosage. 
Study AML17 
In  Study  AML17,  differentiation  syndrome  was  reported  in  21%  (38/178)  of  low-  and  intermediate-risk 
patients (23 patients in the ATRA+ATO group and 15 patients in the ATRA+chemotherapy group) and in 
30% (17/57) of patients of the high-risk group (7 patients in the ATRA-ATO group and 10 patients in the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group).  The  difference  between  treatment  groups  was  not  significant  (p-value 
0.38). 
No prophylaxis was administered for differentiation syndrome in Study AML17. 
QTc Prolongation and cardiac toxicity 
QTc  prolongation  is  a  well-documented  side  effect  of  ATO  that  can  lead  to  potentially  fatal  torsade  de 
pointes-type  ventricular  arrhythmia.  In  clinical  trials,  40%  of  patients  treated  with  ATO  experienced  at 
least  1  QTc  interval  prolongation  greater  than  500  milliseconds.  Prolongation  of  QTc  was  observed 
between 1 and 5 weeks after ATO infusion, and then returned to baseline by the end of the 8 weeks after 
ATO infusion. 
The current SmPC notes that ATO can cause QT interval prolongation and complete atrioventricular block. 
The risk of torsade de pointes is related to the extent of QT prolongation, concomitant administration of 
QT prolonging medicinal products, a history of torsade de pointes, pre-existing QT interval prolongation, 
congestive  heart  failure,  administration  of  potassium-wasting  diuretics  or  amphotericin  B,  or  other 
conditions  that  result  in  hypokalaemia  or  hypomagnesaemia.  According  to  the  current  SmPC,  a  12-lead 
ECG  is  recommended  prior  to  initiating  ATO,  and  serum  electrolytes  and  creatinine  must  be  assessed. 
Patients with risk factors of QTc prolongation or risk factors of torsade de pointes should be monitored by 
continuous  cardiac  ECG  monitoring.  During therapy with  ATO,  serum  potassium  should  be  kept  above  4

mEq/L and magnesium above 1.8 mg/dL. 
Study APL0406 
In the original cohort of the APL0406 study, prolonged QTc interval occurred in 12 patients in the ATRA-
ATO  group  (16%)  and  in  none  of  the  patients  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (p-value  ˂0.001)  (Lo-
Coco et al 2013). 
In  the  extended  cohort  of  the  APL0406  study,  there  were  4  additional  cases  of  prolonged  QTc  interval 
meaning  overall  prolonged  QTc  interval  occurred  in  15  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  (11%)  and  1  in 
the ATRA+chemotherapy group (0.8%) (p-value ˂0.0001) (Platzbecker et al 2016).  
As shown in Table 18, QTc prolongation is primarily observed during the induction phase:

There  was  no  single  case  reported  with  life-threatening  cardiac  arrhythmias.  In  1  of  15  patients  with 
prolonged  QTc  interval,  ATO  was  permanently  discontinued  and  the  patient  went  off  protocol.  QTc 
prolongation is essentially seen during the induction phase. No information on the outcome of individual 
patients with QTc interval prolongation in the APL0406 study is available. 
Study AML17 
In  Study  AML-17,  QTc  prolongation  was  not  reported  separately  from  cardiac  toxicity  (Burnett  et  al 
2015).  Grade  3  or  4  cardiac  toxicity  was  more  common  in  patients  treated  with  ATRA+chemotherapy 
during course 1 (induction), but overall cardiac toxicity was higher in the ATRA-ATO treatment group. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Study APL0406 
In  the  original  cohort  of  the  Study  APL0406,  ATRA-ATO  was  associated  with  a  higher  proportion  of 
patients  with  raised  liver  transaminases  (Lo-Coco et  al 2013a).  Grade 3 or  4  increases  in  liver  enzymes 
were significantly more frequent in the ATRA-ATO group than for the ATRA chemotherapy group, reported 
for  63%  of  patients  treated  with  ATRA-ATO  (43/68)  and  6%  treated  with  ATRA+chemotherapy  (4/69). 
There were no cases of acute hepatic failure or mortality attributable to hepatic toxicity. The increases in 
liver  enzymes  was  in  only  a  minority  of  cases  associated  with  either  bilirubin  or  alkaline  phosphatase 
increase  and  resolved  in  all  cases  with  temporary  discontinuation  of  ATO,  ATRA,  or  both,  or  with 
temporary discontinuation of chemotherapy during the maintenance phase.  
Significant Grade 3-4 elevations of liver function tests were significantly more frequent in the ATRA-ATO 
group (44%) compared with the ATRA+chemotherapy group (3%) (p-value ≤0001) across all treatment 
cycles.

In  the  extended  cohort,  resolution  of  the  hepatic  toxicity  was  confirmed  in  all  cases  upon  temporary 
discontinuation of ATO and/or ATRA or of low-dose chemotherapy during maintenance (Platzbecker et al 
2016). Grade 3-4 increase in liver transaminases occurred in 44% of the ATRA-ATO group and in 3% of 
the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (p-value  ˂0.0001) across  all  treatment  cycles.  Grade  3-4  hepatotoxicity 
was  essentially  seen  during  the  induction  phase  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  (40%),  while  no  cases  were 
reported anymore during the last consolidation cycle (see Table 19).

AML17 
Also in the AML17 study, the ATRA-ATO group showed an increase in Grade 3 and 4 transaminases while 
no  similar  increase  was  noted  with  regard  to  bilirubin  (Burnett  et  al  2015).  After  course  1  in  Study 
AML17,  Grade  3  or  4  raised  ALT  was  reported  for  25%  of  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  (27/109) 
compared with 10% in the ATRA+chemotherapy group (11/108). Grade 3 or 4 raised AST was reported 
for  4%  of  patients  in  each  group  (2/46  for  ATRA-ATO  2/51  for  ATRA+chemotherapy)  and  Grade  3  or  4 
raised  bilirubin  was  more  frequent  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  than  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group, 
reported 
for  1%  of  patients 
in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  (1/110)  compared  with  7% 
in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group (8/114). After course 2, no Grade 3 or 4 raised ALT or bilirubin was reported. 
Grade 3 or 4 raised AST was reported for 2% of patients in each group (2/93 for ATRA+ATO and 2/98 for 
ATRA+chemotherapy).  
In  conclusion,  ATRA+ATO  leads  to  increase  in  Grade  3  and  4  transaminases  without  an  increase  in 
bilirubin.  In  all  cases  this  liver  toxicity  was  reversible  with  temporarily  discontinuation  of  ATRA,  ATO  or 
both, and no cases of hepatic failure or death due to hepatic toxicity were reported. 
The  MAH  sought  Expert  Review  Regarding  Hepatotoxicity  with  ATO  from  Professor  Minotti  Professor  of 
Clinical Pharmacology, University Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. A summary of the report’s conclusions are 
provided below. 
• Mechanism of hepatotoxicity is multifactorial and only in part understood, but oxidative stress plays an 
important role. 
•Hepatotoxicity  from  a  single  agent  shows  noticeable  interindividual  variability  that  is  most  probably 
related to genetic polymorphism. 
•The  higher  prevalence  of  Grade  3-4  liver  enzyme  increases  in  the  ATRA+ATO  treatment  group  in  the 
APL0406  study  suggests  that  ATO  and  ATRA  engage  in  some  kind  of  toxic  synergism  causing  more 
oxidative stress. 
•However, discontinuing drug and re-introducing it does not result in recurring increase in liver enzymes 
which may be the result of continued consumption of retinoid stores by ATO. 
•The  reversibility  and  rechallengeability  of  APL  patients  with  ATRA+ATO  suggests  that  arsenic 
accumulation and fixation of hepatic damage is unlikely.

Secondary Leukaemias and MDS 
No cases of secondary leukemia have been reported in either study with ATRA-ATO.  
In  the  extended  cohort  of  the  APL0406  study,  after  a  median  follow-up  of  40.6  months,  there  were  no 
cases  of  secondary 
leukaemias 
in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  while  there  were  2  cases  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group (Platzbecker et al 2016).  
In  Study  AML17,  there  were  no  reports  of  treatment-related  MDS  or  AML  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group 
compared  with  3%  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  (HR  0.15  [95%  CI:  0.003  to  7.48]  p-value  0.34) 
(Burnett et al 2015). 
Hyperleukocytosis  
Hyperleukocytosis  (WBC  count  ≥10×109/L)  is  also  a  well-known  side  effect  of  ATO  as  mentioned  in  the 
current SmPC for treatment of relapsed/refractory APL.  
In  the  original  cohort  of  Study  APL0406,  WBC  count  >10×109/L  developed  during  induction  therapy  in 
47%  (35/74)  of  patients in  the  ATRA-ATO  group.  As  expected  the  incidence  of  hyperleukocytosis  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy group was lower (24% (19/79) (p-value 0.007) (Lo-Coco et al 2013).  
For the extended cohort with 40.6 months median follow-up, hyperleukocytosis was reported for 43% of 
patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group.  All  cases  were  managed  with  hydroxyurea.In  study  APL0406,  in  fact, 
hydroxyurea  was  permitted  in  patients  who  developed  a  WBC  count  >  10  x109/L  after  initiation  of 
therapy. Hydroxyurea was discontinued when WBC count returned to <10 x109/L. 
No  data  are  available  regarding  hyperleukocytosis  in  AML17  although  it  is  reported  that  7  low-  or 
intermediate- risk patients were given gemtuzumabozogamicin for a rising WBC count.  
Myelosuppression 
In  Study  APL0406  the  dose  of  ATO  and/or  ATRA  was  to  be  reduced  in  the  event  of  significant 
myelosuppression defined as: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1x109/L and/or platelets <50 x109/L for 
>5 weeks after the start  of a course. During the maintenance phase, the doses of methotrexate and 6-
mercaptopurine had to be modified as a function of the peripheral blood counts as follows: 
• WBC between 2.5 and 3.5x109/L: dose reduction by 50%. 
•WBC <2.5 x 109/L: temporary discontinuation of maintenance. 
Myelosuppression  was  significantly 
reduced 
in 
the  ATRA-ATO  group  compared  with 
the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group  in  Study  APL0406.  In  the  original  cohort  of  Study  APL0406  (Lo-Coco  et  al 
2013) and the extended cohort (Platzbecker et al 2016), Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia lasting >15 days and 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia lasting >15 days were significantly more frequent both during induction 
therapy  and  after  each  consolidation  course  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  group  than  in  the  ATRA-ATO 
group (see Figure 14).

No data are available regarding neutropenia/thrombocytopenia in AML17, however, patients in the ATRA-
ATO  group  had  significantly  less  requirement  for  most  aspects  of  supportive  care  than  did  those  in  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group.  Over  the  first  2  courses  of  treatment,  ATRA-ATO  was  associated  with  an 
average of 7.4 fewer days in the hospital, 4.5 fewer units of blood, 4.3 fewer units of platelets, and 10.7 
fewer days of IV antibiotics. A summary of the supportive care required is presented in Table 20.

Age 
In the original cohort of Study APL0406, 35 patients aged between 60 and <71 years received treatment; 
16 were assigned to ATRA+ATO and 19 to ATRA+chemotherapy. No patients died in the group receiving 
ATRA+ATO.  In  the  group  receiving  ATRA+chemotherapy,  3  patients  died  (1  during  induction  from  the 
differentiation  syndrome  and  2  during  consolidation  from  pulmonary  embolism  and  bronchopneumonia) 
(Lo-Coco et al 2013b).  
No description of older patients was included in the AML17 publication (Burnett et al 2015). 
Special Populations from the Literature 
Only  1  study  was  identified  in  patients  aged  ≤15  years  with  newly  diagnosed  APL.  This  study  reported 
leukocytosis  (68%)  as  the  most  common  ATO-related  toxicity,  with  other  ATO-related  toxicities  being 
minimal  and  transient.  Two  early  deaths  occurred  from  intracranial  haemorrhage.  Post-remission  ATO 
therapy  continued  for  3  years;  the  most  common  side  effect  was  ATO-induced  neutropenia.  No  chronic 
arsenic toxicity or second malignancies were found during the follow-up period, and arsenic retention was 
not significant in patients off treatment more than 24 months (Zhou et al 2010).  
Based on a study in newly diagnosed APL patients aged≥60 years, Zhang et al 2013 reported that single-
agent  ATO  was  particularly  suitable  for  elderly  APL  patients  who  are  not  tolerant  to  conventional 
chemotherapy.  The  side  effects  of  ATO  were  mild  and  manageable,  even  for  elderly  patients  with 
antecedent cardiac, hepatic, and/or renal diseases. Also, as a result of the absence of myelosuppressive 
effects  during  post-remission  therapy,  ATO  treatment  could  not  only  shorten  the  duration  of 
hospitalization  but  also  avoid  deaths  from  infection  in  HCR,  prolonging  the  survival  time  of  the  elderly 
patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not available 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  Study  APL0406,  1  patient  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  was  taken  off  protocol  during  induction  due  to 
medical  decision  and  1  after  induction  therapy  owing  to  a  toxic  effect  (repetitive  tachycardia).  In  the 
ATRA+chemotherapy  group,  1  patient  did  not  receive  consolidation  therapy  because  of  a  cardiac  toxic 
effect  and  loss  to  follow-up.  Another  patient  went  off  protocol  after  consolidation  therapy  owing  to 
withdrawal  of  consent,  major  protocol  violation,  and  a  toxic  effect  and  2  patients  did  not  complete 
maintenance therapy because of prolonged myelosuppression (
˃50 days) .
In  the  extended  cohort  of  APL0406,  for  1  patient  who  started  induction  in  the  ATRA+ATO  group  the 
assigned treatment was terminated early due medical decision (detection of severe QTc prolongation and 
electrolytes abnormalities at day+3). Likewise 1 patient in the ATRA+chemotherapy group had induction 
treatment discontinued due to medical decision (unknown reason).  
Four  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  went  off  protocol  before  the  bone  marrow  assessment  after  third 
consolidation due to toxicity and medical decision. In the ATRA+chemotherapy group, 6 patients did not 
undergo bone marrow evaluation after third consolidation because toxicity. 
No information is available from Study AML17 on the numbers of patients discontinuing ATRA+ATO due to 
safety reasons although it was noted that 1 patient withdrew from the trial during course 1 of treatment 
because  of  fungal  chest  complications  and  during  course  2,  2  patients  in  the  ATRA+ATO  arm  were  not 
given  ATO  because  of  QTc  prolongation.  No  information  is  available  with  regard  to  the  risk  category  of

these patients (high-, intermediate- or low-risk APL). 
Both  study  protocols  required  modification  to  study  drugs  in  the  event  of  differentiation  syndrome, 
pseudotumour  cerebri,  QT  prolongation,  and  hepatotoxicity.  Additionally,  in  Study  APL0406,  dose 
modifications  were  recommended  in  the  event  of  other  non-haematological  toxicities  of  Grade  2  and 
above,  and  myelosuppression.  Any  Grade  3-4  toxicity  unresponsive  to  dose  reduction  was  grounds  for 
treatment-withdrawal in Study APL0406, and in Study AML17 severe neurological toxicity required study 
drug discontinuation.  
No  details  were  available  regarding  the  numbers  of  patients  requiring  dose  modification  or  delays  for 
Study APL0406.  
During  Course  1  in  study  AML17,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  had  treatment 
modifications compared with the ATRA+chemotherapy group. During course 2 in Study AML17, 9 patients 
on  ATRA+chemotherapy  had  treatment  modifications  or  delays,  including  1  who  switched  to  ATRA-ATO 
(clinician’s  decision),  whereas  18  patients  in  the  ATRA-ATO  group  had  dose  modifications  or  delays, 
including 6 who switched to idarubicin (clinician’s decision). Two patients in the ATRA-ATO group were not 
given ATO because of QTc prolongation. 
Post marketing experience 
Arsenic trioxide (TRISENOX) has been approved in the US since 25 September 2000 and in Europe (EU; 
centralized procedure) on 5 March 2002 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory APL. At the time of this 
MAA products containing active substance ATO have been registered by the MAH in 46 countries globally. 
The MAH has received reports containing 2048 adverse reactions from post-marketing reporting sources, 
including non-serious solicited reports. 
Throughout  the  marketing  experience  of  ATO,  the  most  common  adverse  reactions  of  greater  than  5% 
frequency in patients with relapsed or refractory APL are from the following MedDRA SOCs: Investigations 
(18.3%),  General  Disorders  and  Administration  Site  Conditions  (8.6%),  Blood  and  Lymphatic  system 
Disorders  (8.8%),  Respiratory,  Thoracic,  and  Mediastinal  Disorders  (7.7%),  Nervous  System  Disorders 
(6.6%), Cardiac Disorders (6.2%), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (5.6%).  
Significant  ADRs  that  require  special  mention  to  prescribers  include  QT  prolongation,  APL  differentiation 
syndrome,  leukocytosis,  anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  gastrointestinal  reactions  (nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  abdominal  pain),  fatigue,  oedema,  dyspnoea,  cough,  rash,  itching,  AST 
increased, peripheral neuropathy, and headaches. 
Systematic Literature Review of Safety 
A systematic literature review was conducted with the objective of identifying all published clinical studies 
in  first-line  APL,  where  ATO  was  included  in  any  phase  of  the  treatment  regimen  (see  the  Analysis 
performed across trials Section above for additional details).  
Two  studies  involved  high-  and  low-risk  APL  patients  treated  with  ATRA-ATO  (Estey  et  al  2006  and 
Ravandi  et  al  2009).  In  the  Estey  study,  elevations  in  ALT  or  AST  were  seen  in  17  patients,  all 
asymptomatic and unaccompanied by rises in serum bilirubin. In none of these 17 patients was ATRA or 
ATO discontinued. Five patients had toxicity that led to discontinuation of ATO, 3 with arrhythmias, 1 with 
QTc prolongation, and 1 with peripheral neuropathy. In the Ravandi study, 2 out of 82 patients had Grade 
3 increase in liver enzymes and 3 patients had Grade 3 cardiac arrhythmias. One patient had a Grade 4 
myocardial infarction. Both ATRA+ATO studies included low- as well as high-risk patients. The number of 
patients  included  in  the  studies  is  low.  Safety  results  are  in  line  those  of  the  APL0406  and  the  AML17

studies. 
All  other  studies  involved  single  agent  ATO.  Amongst  the  studies  using  ATO  alone  there  were  2  studies 
including  children  (Zhou  et  al  2010  conducted  a  study  in  19  paediatrics  and  Aznab  et  al  2015  studied 
paediatrics and adults, they reported that 60% of their patients were aged 12 to 24 years. Both of these 
studies report long-term follow-up information with no long-term toxicity nor secondary malignancies.  
One study was conducted in patients aged 60 years and above (Zhang et al 2013). Side effects were not 
different with 21% of patients showing liver toxicity and 36% QTc prolongation. All non-hematologic AEs 
such  as  ECG  abnormalities,  GI  reactions,  liver  dysfunction,  and  oedema  were  all  manageable  and 
reversible.  Other  non-hematologic  AEs  were  all  transient  and  mild,  and  no  further  management  was 
required 
Multiple studies (Alimoghaddam et al 2006, Ghavamzadeh et al 2011, Mathews et al 2006a, Mathews et 
al 2006b) showed liver toxicity to a variable extent. In all cases it concerned essentially increase in liver 
transaminases  without  increase  in  bilirubin.  In  most  cases  the liver toxicity  was  reversible.  There  was 1 
patient  in  the  Mathews  study  who  developed  Grade  2  hepatotoxicity  during  maintenance  who  had 
persistent asymptomatic Grade 1 transaminitis 6 months after completion of therapy.  
These  studies  confirmed  the  fact  that  hepatotoxicity  concerns  elevation  of  transaminases  alone  that  is 
reversible in all cases. It also confirmed the low cardiotoxicity rate. 
Finally,  the  Eghtedar  et  al  2015  publication  compared  retrospectively  the  incidence  of  secondary 
leukemias  in  patients  who  received  either  ATRA+chemotherapy  or  ATRA+ATO  (17%  versus  2%, 
respectively).  They  concluded  that treatment  of  patients  with  APL  using  the  non-chemotherapy  regimen 
of ATRA+ATO was not associated with a higher incidence of secondary cancers adjusted for unit time of 
exposure vs ATRA+chemotherapy regimen. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Trisenox  has  been  approved  in  the  EU  for  the  single-agent  treatment  of  relapsed/refractory  acute 
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) since 2002. Its safety profile, based on the results from the clinical studies 
conducted in the relapsed/refractory APL clinical program and on the post-marketing data obtained by the 
MAH  since  2000,  is  well  characterised.  Overall,  the  main  toxicity  associated  with  ATO  treatment  is: 
leukocytosis  and  DS,  QT  prolongation  and  arrhythmias  (often  exasperated  by  concomitant  electrolytic 
alterations),  peripheral  neuropathy,  hepatotoxicity 
(mainly 
in 
the 
form  of 
transaminitis), 
myelosuppression and gastrointestinal disorders (i.e. diarrhoea and nausea). 
On  the  contrary,  safety  information  regarding  the  proposed  ATRA-ATO  combination  for  the  first  line 
treatment of APL is currently limited, and due to the potential synergistic toxicity of ATRA and ATO (i.e. 
on  hepatotoxicity),  no  direct  extrapolation  of  safety  data  observed  with  single-agent  ATO  is  considered 
adequate.  
Safety data and information regarding the overall exposition to the proposed ATRA-ATO combination, the 
actual adverse events (AEs) incidence profile, the toxicity profile and, most of all, the long-term toxicity 
of ATRA-ATO is very limited. In this regard, if only those patients actually exposed to the same ATRA-ATO 
regimen  as  the  one  proposed  for  MA  are  considered,  the  safety  database  would  comprise  only  129 
subjects  (i.e.  the  patients  who  received  ATRA-ATO  across  all  study  APL0406  cohorts).  A  post-
authorisation  long  term  safety  cohort  study  in  APL  patients  treated  with  Trisenox  will  conducted  by  the 
MAH  in  order  to  explore  further  the  long-term  safety  of  ATRA+ATO  in  newly  diagnosed  low  to 
intermediate risk APL patients in a real-world clinical practice setting (see Risk Management Plan). 
In study APL040695 SAEs were reported, 43 for the ATRA-ATO arm and 52 for the ATRA+chemotherapy 
Assessment report

arm.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  the  ATRA-ATO  combination,  as  reflected  by  the  provided  SAEs,  is 
consistent with the specific toxicities of ATRA and ATO.  
Compared with ATRA+chemotherapy, an advantage with ATRA-ATO is mainly observed in the lower rates 
of  infections/infective  complications.  In  fact,  despite  a  similar  rate  of  pneumonia+bronchopneumonia, 
febrile neutropenia, fever and pyrexia were observed in 11 vs. 3 subjects with ATRA+chemotherapy and 
ATRA-ATO respectively. Moreover, bacteraemia and sepsis were only reported for patient treated with the 
AIDA regimen.  
ATRA-ATO  was  also  superior  to  the  AIDA  regimen  with  respect  to  other  common  chemotherapy-related 
symptoms (as supported by the lower rates of SAEs in the GI and general disorders SOCs observed with 
ATRA-ATO and the lower myelotoxic potential). 
Moreover,  considering  the  biologic  characteristics  of  APL,  the  reduced  rates  of  haemorrhagic  (1 
haemorrhagic  SAE  reported  with  ATRA-ATO  vs.  3  SAEs  with  the  AIDA  regimen)  and  thromboembolic 
events (1 vs. 4 thromboembolic SAEs reported for ATRA-ATO and AIDA, respectively) further support the 
better disease control achieved with ATRA-ATO.  
Safety  data  regarding  on-study  deaths  and  deaths  in  remission  from  study  APL0406  also  favoured  the 
ATRA-ATO  regimen.  Only  1  patient  experienced  a  fatal  AE  during  treatment  with  ATRA-ATO  (H1N1 
pneumonia),  while  4  subjects  died  during induction  in  the  ATRA+chemotherapy  arm.  Most  interestingly, 
with  the  exception of  1  patient  who  experienced  a fatal  AE  of  bronchopneumonia  (which  is  an  expected 
complication of cytotoxic treatments in leukaemia), the other induction deaths observed in the AIDA arm 
(2  patients  died  because  of  differentiation  syndrome  related  complications,  and  1  of  ischemic  stroke) 
might suggest an inferior disease control with chemotherapy. Deaths in remission data, as emerge from 
study  APL0406  (1  death  in  remission  in  the  ATRA-ATO  arm  vs.  5  in  the  AIDA  arm,  respectively),  also 
support the overall favourable safety profile of ATRA-ATO.  
In both studies APL0406 and AML17, the incidence of DS was higher in the ATRA-ATO group compared to 
patients treated with AIDA (i.e. in the extended cohort of study APL046 the DS rates were 13% and 7% 
for  ATRA-ATO  and  ATRA+chemotherapy,  respectively).  However,  the  overall  incidence  of  DS  in  the 
provided trials (19% in study APL0406 and 21% in AML17, respectively) was within the ranges expected 
with  chemotherapy  regimens  in  the  first  line-treatment  (maybe  because  of  the  additional  preventive 
measures employed in the APL0406 study [i.e. prophylactic corticosteroids] and the exclusion of high-risk 
patients),  and  no  significant  differences  were  observed  with  respect  to  severe  DS  rates.  Overall,  it  was 
concluded  that,  with  the  mandatory  prophylaxis  with  corticosteroids  as  employed  in  study  APL0406 
(SmPC, section 4.4.)  no concerns for a significant increase in the incidence or severity of DS with ATRA-
ATO are present.  
QTc prolongation is also a well-documented side effect of ATO that can lead to potentially fatal torsade de 
pointes-type ventricular arrhythmia. The available data clearly showed that the risk of QTc prolongation is 
significantly higher with the ATRA-ATO combination. On the other hand, the combination with ATRA was 
confirmed  not  to  increase  or  modify  in  any  way  the  known  risk  of  QTc  prolongation  with  ATO.  In  fact, 
approximately  11-16%  of  patients  treated  with  ATRA-ATO  in  pivotal  study  APL0406  presented  a  QTc 
prolongation,  mainly  during  induction,  and  no  patient  developed  severe  arrhythmias.  Moreover,  rates of 
ischemic disease and cardiac failure events were higher in the ATRA+chemotherapy arms. 
Although  hepatotoxicity  is  common  with  ATO  (included  in  SmPC),  the  combination  with  ATRA  seems  to 
significantly  increase  its  frequency  and  severity:  a  grade  3-4  transaminases  increase  was  observed  in 
44% of the patients who received ATRA-ATO in study APL0406 compared to 3% of patients treated with 
ATRA+chemotherapy. However, the absence of cases of acute hepatic failure or mortality attributable to 
ATRA-ATO induced hepatic toxicity is reassuring. Moreover, hepatotoxicity proved to be reversible if ATRA 
and/or  ATO  are  discontinued.  As  a  safety  measure,  information  on  Grade  3-4  hepatotoxicity  has  been 
included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 60/74 
 
  
  
It is noted, however, that only 25% of patients treated in the ATRA-ATO arm of study AML17 developed a 
grade  3-4  hepatotoxicity,  compared  to  44%  in  study  APL0406.  These  data  could  suggest  that  the 
alternative  ATRA-ATO  regimen  employed  in  the  supportive  study  might  be  better  tolerated.  It  is 
acknowledged that, at present, efficacy and safety data are too limited to support the use of the AML17 
ATRA-ATO  regimen,  however  further  data  are  requested  to  investigate  the  efficacy  and  safety  profile  of 
this  alternative  regimen.  The  MAH  will  obtain  data  from  two  pre-existing  ongoing  registries  (the 
NAPOLEON registry from the German AML Intergroup and the French APL Study Group registry) to further 
evaluate the benefit/risk of different ATRA-ATO administration regimens (see risk management plan). 
Leukocytosis is another well-known AE with ATO, and the higher rates of patients with WBC count > 10 
x109/L  after  treatment  initiation  observed  in  the  ATRA-ATO  arm  in  study  APL0406  is  not  therefore 
unexpected.  
It has been noticed that the cumulative dose of ATO received in the ATRA-ATO regimen proposed for this 
application  (21  mg/kg)  is  significantly  higher  than  the  one  calculated  for  the  already  authorised 
relapsed/refractory  use  (11.3  mg/kg)  or  administered  in  the  alternative  ATRA-ATO  regimen  in  study 
AML17  (17  mg/kg).  Even  though  the  differences  between  chronic  and  acute  arsenic  intake  are 
acknowledged,  the  cumulative  ATO  exposure  with  the  proposed  ATRA-ATO  regimen  (i.e.  1470  mg  for  a 
70  Kg  adult  man)  is  also  significantly  higher  than  the  calculated  annual  intake  of  arsenic  which  is 
considered  to  be  possibly  harmful  by  the  WHO  (max  54.77  mg).  The  carcinogenic  activity  of  ATO  is 
already  included  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Of  note,  the  new  few  long-term  data  from  both  studies 
APL0406 and AML17 point toward a reduced risk of secondary leukaemia/MDS with ATRA-ATO. However, 
in  light  of  the  high  cumulative  ATO  dose  administered  in  the  proposed  first-line  regimen,  the  MAH  will 
investigate/control  the  long-term  carcinogenic  risk  of  ATO  as  part  of  the  post-authorisation  long  term 
safety cohort study in APL patients treated with Trisenox designed to explore further the long-term safety 
of  ATRA+ATO  in  newly  diagnosed  low  to  intermediate  risk  APL  patients  in  a  real-world  clinical  practice 
setting (see Risk Management Plan). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, although the available safety data are limited, the toxicity profile of ATO in the proposed ATRA-
ATO  combination  appears  sufficiently  characterized.  All  known  ATO-specific  toxicities  are  confirmed  (i.e. 
differentiation  syndrome,  QTc  prolongation  and  leukocytosis),  and  their  incidence  appears  overall 
unmodified by the co-administration of ATRA.  
Compared to ATRA+chemotherapy, an advantage was observed with ATRA-ATO in terms of myelotoxicity, 
infective  risk  and  thromboembolic/haemorrhagic  complications.  Moreover,  a  positive  trend  toward  a 
reduction in remission deaths and in the risk of secondary leukaemia/MDS has also been observed. 
Hepatotoxicity, on the contrary, is increased with the ATRA-ATO combination due to a possible synergistic 
toxic effect of ATRA and ATO. However, the observed hepatic damage is reversible with the suspension of 
ATO  and/or  ATRA,  and  no  additional  safety  measures  beyond  a  warning  on  the  SmPC  are  considered 
needed. 
In conclusion, the toxicity of the proposed ATRA-ATO combination is considered manageable.

3.  Benefit risk assessment 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for the first line acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL)  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia  is a potentially life threatening rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) characterized by the presence of the Promyelocytic Leukemia Retinoic Acid Receptor Alpha (PML-
RARα) fusion transcript. The annual incidence of APL in the European Union (EU) is reported to be 
0.14/100,000 (Sant et al 2010).  
The disease is highly curable with improve treatment care. The treatment for APL as changed over the 
years and has progressively increased the CR. The first-line treatment of APL is currently based on the 
combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with chemotherapy (mainly anthracyclines) during both 
treatment induction and consolidation (Lo-Coco et al 2010). Standard treatment currently provides a CR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 65/74 
 
  
  
 
of 90% and approximately 80% cures, but 9-10% of patients have an early death, 5% death in patients 
in CR, 5-10% patients relapse and 1-2% of patients developing MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome) and 
AML (acute myeloid leukemia). Patients having an early death or death in CR are mainly older patients 
because of their lower tolerability to chemotherapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH has submitted the results from two clinical studies (pivotal phase III study APL0406 and 
supportive phase III study AML17) comparing the efficacy and safety of ATRA-ATO vs. an AIDA-like 
regimen in first-line low- to intermediate-risk APL patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Results from pivotal study APL0406 support the use of ATRA-ATO in first line APL. With respect to the 
primary endpoint, the 2-year EFS rates observed (97% with ATRA-ATO and 86% with 
ATRA+chemotherapy (p=0.02 for superiority) are considered adequate to demonstrate the superiority of 
ATRA-ATO to ATRA+chemotherapy. These results are considered of high clinical relevance; especially 
taking into account that the majority of relapses in APL are usually recorded within 2 years from the 
achievement of response (i.e., 75% and 65% of relapses occurred within 2 year from the end of 
treatment in the AIDA-0493 and AIDA-2000 studies, respectively). EFS results observed in the per-
protocol analysis at different median follow-up (50-month EFS rate was 96% with ATRA-ATO vs 81% with 
ATRA+chemotherapy, p=0.0034) and in the extended cohort (the 2-year EFS rate was 98% in the 
ATRA+ATO group and 87% in the ATRA+chemotherapy group, p ˂0.0001) were all consistent with the 
primary analysis and supported its robustness. 
The results in the secondary endpoints also supported the significant benefit obtained with ATRA+ATO vs. 
ATRA+chemotherapy: a statistically significant and clinically relevant 8% advantage in the 2-year OS rate 
with a consistent positive trend in terms of 2-year DFS rate was observed and was confirmed in the 
longer follow-up analysis and in the extension cohort. Consistently, also the CIR analysis demonstrated a 
clinical advantage with ATRA-ATO compared to ATRA+chemotherapy, both in the original and in the 
extended cohort of study APL0406. A non-statistically significant trend in favour of ATRA-ATO was also 
observed in terms of haematological CR (HCR 100% vs. 95%, p=0.12 in the original cohort; 100% vs. 
97%, p=0.12 in the extended cohort). 
With respect to QoL, a significant improvement in patients who received ATRA-ATO compared to the AIDA 
regimen was observed. However, this advantage was lost after consolidation. 
Efficacy results in low/intermediate risk patients (n=178) from the supportive study AML17 are consistent 
with those observed in the pivotal study (4-year EFS rate 92% vs. 71% in the ATRA-ATO and ATRA-
chemotherapy groups respectively, HR=0.34, p=0.008; 4-year OS rate 95% vs. 90%, HR=0.47, 
p=0.17). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Not applicable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 66/74 
 
  
  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of the ATRA-ATO combination, as emerged from the available data, is 
consistent with the specific toxicities of ATRA and ATO. Moreover, safety data regarding on-study deaths 
and deaths in remission from study APL0406 are in favour of  the ATRA-ATO regimen. 
The incidence of differentiation syndrome (a potentially-lethal complication with differentiating agents) 
was higher in the ATRA-ATO group compared to patients treated with AIDA (in the extended cohort of 
study APL046 the DS rates were 13% and 7%, respectively); however no significant differences were 
observed with respect to severe DS rates. 
QTc prolongation is also a well-documented side effect of ATO that can lead to potentially fatal 
arrhythmias. The available data clearly show that the risk of QTc prolongation is significantly higher with 
the ATRA-ATO combination. In fact, approximately 11-16% of patients treated with ATRA-ATO in pivotal 
study APL0406 presented a QTc prolongation, mainly during induction. On the other hand, the 
combination with ATRA was confirmed not to increase or modify in any way the known risk of QTc 
prolongation with ATO. 
Leukocytosis is another well-known AE with ATO, and the in study APL0406 higher rates of patients with 
WBC count > 10 x109/L after treatment initiation were observed in the ATRA-ATO arm compared to 
ATRA+chemotherapy (47% vs. 24% in the original cohort). Hydroxyurea was needed in order to control 
leukocytosis.  
Although hepatotoxicity is also known to be common with ATO, the combination with ATRA seems to 
significantly increased its frequency and severity: a grade 3-4 transaminases increase was observed in 
44% of the patients who received ATRA-ATO in study APL0406 compared to 3% of patients treated with 
ATRA+chemotherapy. However, no cases of acute hepatic failure or mortality attributable to ATRA-ATO 
induced hepatic toxicity were observed, and hepatotoxicity proved to be reversible if ATRA and/or ATO 
are discontinued. 
With respect to infections/infective complications a similar rate of pneumonia+bronchopneumonia was 
observed in the ATRA-ATO and ATRA+chemotherapy arms. However, febrile neutropenia, fever and 
pyrexia rates were higher with ATRA+chemotherapy than with ATRA+ATO (11 vs. 3 subjects). Moreover, 
bacteraemia and sepsis were only reported for patient treated with the AIDA regimen. 
Overall, lower rates of SAEs in the GI and general disorders SOCs were observed with ATRA-ATO, and its 
myelotoxic potential was also reduced compared to ATRA+chemotherapy. 
The rates of haemorrhagic (1 haemorrhagic SAE reported with ATRA-ATO vs. 3 SAEs with the AIDA 
regimen) and thromboembolic events (1 vs. 4 thromboembolic SAEs reported for ATRA-ATO and AIDA, 
respectively), which are common complications with APL; also support the possibility that a better disease 
control might be achieved with ATRA-ATO. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety information regarding the proposed ATRA-ATO combination for the first line treatment of APL 
is limited. Indeed, no information regarding the actual adverse events (AEs) incidence profile, the toxicity 
profile in special populations and, most of all, the long-term toxicity of ATRA-ATO was available. A post-
authorisation long term safety cohort study in APL patients treated with Trisenox will be conducted by the 
MAH in order to investigate the long-term safety of ATRA+ATO in newly diagnosed low to intermediate 
risk APL patients in a real-world clinical practice setting (see Risk Management Plan). 
Only 25% of patients treated in the ATRA-ATO arm of study AML17 developed a grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity, 
compared to 44% in study APL0406. These data could suggest that the alternative ATRA-ATO regimen 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/623089/2016 
Page 67/74 
 
  
  
employed in the supportive study might be better tolerated. Although, at present, data are too limited to 
support the use of the AML17 ATRA-ATO regimen, the possibility to further investigate the efficacy and 
safety profile of this alternative and better tolerated regimen should be evaluated. The MAH will obtain 
data from two ongoing registries (the NAPOLEON registry from the German AML Intergroup and the 
French APL Study Group registry) to further evaluate the benefit/risk of different ATRA-ATO 
administration regimens. 
Although the carcinogenic activity of ATO is already included as a potential risk in the RMP, considering 
the higher cumulative dose in the first-line treatment and the limited long-term safety data with ATRA-
ATO, the MAH will further investigate/control the carcinogenic risk of ATO (see risk management plan).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy data in terms of primary and secondary endpoints demonstrated a clinical and statistical non-
inferiority  of  ATRA/ATO  combination  therapy  versus  the  active  comparator  (ATRA-chemotherapy 
combination), showing a clear benefit of ATRA/ATO combination therapy in the treatment of patients with 
low-to-intermediate-risk  APL.  The  use  of  ATRA/ATO  is  associated  with  a  similar  rate  of  complete 
remission  allowing  the  patients  to  go  through  the  consolidation  phase.  These  results  are  considered  of 
important clinical relevance. 
Overall, although the available safety data are limited, the toxicity profile of ATO in the proposed ATRA-
ATO combination appears sufficiently characterized, and do not significantly differ from the known safety 
profile of ATO, with incidence of major AEs overall unmodified by the co-administration of ATRA.  
Compared  to  the  standard  AIDA  regimen,  no  cytotoxic  agent  is  included  in  the  proposed  ATRA-ATO 
combination, and its clinical effect is mainly based on inducing the terminal differentiation of APL blasts. 
Moreover,  no  long-term  maintenance  is  needed  with  ATRA-ATO;  on  the  contrary,  2-year  maintenance 
with  MTX,  6-MP  and  ATRA  is  mandatory  in  the  AIDA  arm.  Taking  into  account  the  possible  impact  of 
prolonged chemotherapy on quality of life, the absence of maintenance with ATRA-ATO can be considered 
an important favourable effect per se. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefit-risk balance 
Considered the clear therapeutic advantage associated with the ATRA-ATO combination therapy and the 
more favourable and overall manageable safety profile compared to ATRA+chemotherapy, the benefits of 
the combination in the claimed first-line indication overweigh the risks. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefits associated with the ATRA/ATO combination in the first-line setting of APL are widely 
recognised by the expert community, and the drug combination is included in most clinical guidelines and 
frequently used in the clinical practice. Thus a MA in in the first-line setting of APL is considered the 
natural consequence of what has become a recognised treatment regimen in this disease setting. The 
efficacy of the combination therapy is considered clearly demonstrated and the safety profile favorably 
compares with ATRA-chemotherapy regimens. It is concluded that the ATRA/ATO combination is 
confirmed as an important treatment option in the drug armamentarium for first-line treatment of APL.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
The MAH has submitted the results from two clinical studies (pivotal phase III study APL0406 and 
supportive phase III study AML17) in the format of bibliographic references. 
This is considered acceptable considering the difficulty of conducting further clinical studies given the 
available results, the detailed study data reported in these comprehensive references, including short-
term and long-term efficacy results, the quality of the design of the studies, the convincing treatment 
effect, the totality of the available data about the activity of ATO in APL, and the synergistic effect of the 
ATRA-ATO combination. 
Regarding the safety information no information regarding the actual adverse events AEs incidence and 
the long-term toxicity of ATRA-ATO was available. Additional pharmacovigilance activities including a 
post-authorisation long term safety cohort study in APL patients treated with Trisenox in newly diagnosed 
low to intermediate risk APL patients and two ongoing registries (the NAPOLEON registry from the 
German AML Intergroup and the French APL Study Group registry) will address this safety issue and 
provide additional data on the safety profile of ATRA-ATO combination. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trisenox is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition

approved one  
Extension of Indication to include induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with newly 
diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, ≤ 10 x 
103/μl) in combination with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA), characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) 
translocation and/or the presence of the Pro-Myelocytic Leukaemia/Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha 
(PML/RAR-alpha) gene for Trisenox. 
As a consequence, sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated regarding the posology, 
efficacy and safety information and warnings. In addition, a Risk Management Plan (Version 1.3) is 
introduced. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following amended conditions:

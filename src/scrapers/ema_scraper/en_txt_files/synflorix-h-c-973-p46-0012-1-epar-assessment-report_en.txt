II.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
In  response  to  this  FUM  the  MAH  has  submitted  an  overview  of  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042.  In  the 
overview  the  results  are  discussed  taking  into  account  carriage  results  from  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014, 
the  POET  trial,  studies  with  other  PCVs,  postmarketing  surveillance  studies,  as  well  as  immunological 
memory demonstrated in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046. This is summarized below.  
o  Clinical aspects 
Background 
Study  10PN-PD-DIT-042  is  a  follow-up  of  studies  10PN-PD-DIT-014  and  10PN-PD-DIT-010.  Study 
10PN-PD-DIT-010  evaluated  the  effect  of  prophylactic  use  of  antipyretics  on  febrile  reactions  during 
primary  vaccination  with  Synflorix  coadministered  with  Infanrix  hexa  (combined  diphtheria-tetanus-
acellular  pertussis-hepatitis  B-inactivated  poliovirus  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  type  b  conjugate 
vaccine: DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib).  
Study10PN-PD-DIT-014 was the booster vaccination phase of 10PN-PD-DIT-010 and also evaluated as 
the  primary  objective  the  percentage  reduction  in  febrile  reactions  when  antipyretics  were  used 
prophylactically  after  booster  vaccination  with  Synflorix  coadministered  with  Infanrix  hexa  in  children 
at 12-15 months of age.  
Methods  
For clarity of this report the methods section below is copied from the AR for P046 012.  
•  Objectives 
Primary: 
• 
To  demonstrate  the  immunological  memory  induced  following  primary  vaccination  in 
study  10PN-PD-DIT-010  (107017)  and  booster  vaccination  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014 
(107137)  with  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine,  through  evaluation  of  early  antibody 
responses after an additional dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT at 40-48 months of age, compared 
to the unprimed group. 
Criteria for immunological memory: 
The immunological memory was demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI around the GMC 
ratios  (pooled  primed  groups  over  unprimed  group)  was  higher  than  1  for  all  10  vaccine 
serotypes. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To  assess  the  antibody  persistence  25-36  months  following  the  last  10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine  dose  administered  at  12-15  months  of  age  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014 
(107137). 
To  assess  long-term  effects  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  on  nasopharyngeal  carriage 
16-32 months and 25-36 months following the last vaccine dose administered at 12-15 
months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014 (107137). 
To  assess  the  antibody  persistence  25-36  months  following  vaccination  with  GSK 
Biologicals’ MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014 (107137). 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  when  given  as  a  2-dose 
catch-up vaccination course to the unprimed children that participated in study 10PN-
PD-DIT-014 (107137) in their fourth year of life.

• 
• 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine when given as a 2-
dose  catchup  vaccination  course  to  the  unprimed  children  that  participated  in  study 
10PN-PD-DIT-014 (107137) in their fourth year of life. 
To assess the safety and reactogenicity of an additional booster dose of the 10Pn-PD-
DiT vaccine administered at 40-48 months of age in children previously vaccinated with 
the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine at 12-15 months of age in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014 (107137). 
•  Study design 
Open, controlled, multi-centre, long-term follow-up study with three parallel groups: 
•  AP-AP group*: subjects primed and boosted with 10Pn-PD-DiT co-administered with DTPa-
HBV-IPV/Hib with prophylactic antipyretic treatment receiving an additional dose of 10Pn-
PD-DiT vaccine. 
•  NAP-pre  group*:  subjects  primed  and  boosted  with  10Pn-PD-DiT  co-administered  with 
DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib  without  prophylactic  antipyretic  treatment  receiving  an  additional  dose 
of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
•  Unprimed  group  (referred  to  as  ‘Unprim’  in  result  tables  and  figures):  age-matched 
subjects  not  previously  vaccinated  with  any  pneumococcal  vaccine  receiving  two  doses  of 
10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine. 
*pooled AP-AP and NAP-pre groups are referred to as “Prim” in result tables and figures. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
•  Male  or  female  between,  and  including  31  and  44  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  the 
• 
enrolment. 
For the AP-AP and NAP-pre groups, subjects who received a booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT 
in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014  prior  to  amendment  3.  For  the  unprimed  group,  subjects  who 
received a dose of MenACWY-TT in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014. 
•  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. 
• 
Free  of  any  known  or  suspected  health  problems  as  established  by  medical  history  and 
clinical examination before entering into the study. 
The sample size of the primed groups (AP-AP and NAP-pre) was contingent on the number of 
subjects  who  received  a  full  vaccination  course  (i.e.  a  3-dose  primary  vaccination  in  study 
10PN-PD-DIT-010  and  a  booster  vaccination  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014  with the  10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine  before  implementation  of  Amendment  3.  The  sample  size  of  the  unprimed  group 
depended  on  the  number  of  subjects  who  received  one  dose  of  MenACWY-TT  in  study  10PN-
PD-DIT-014.  
• 
Treatments 
Vaccination  schedule  /site:  The  additional  dose  of  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  was  given  at  40-48 
months of age. Catch-up vaccination started at 40-48 months of age with an interval of at least 
2  months  (56-118  days)  between  doses.  The  10Pn-PD-DiT  vaccine  was  administered 
intramuscularly in the deltoid. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Serology 
Pneumococcal serotype specific total IgG antibodies (antibodies to 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19F,  23F)  were  each  measured  by  22F-inhibition  ELISA  (enzyme-linked  immunosorbent 
assay).. The cut-off of the assay was 0.05 μg/mL. 
S. pneumoniae opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) was measured by a killing-assay The cut-off of 
the assay was an opsonic titre of 8. 
Anti-PD  antibodies  were  determined  using  an  ELISA  assay  The  cut-off  of  the  assay  was  100 
EL.U/mL.  
The  antibody  concentrations  (22F-inhibition  ELISA)  and  OPA  against  the  cross-reactive 
pneumococcal  serotypes  6A  and  19A  were  also  determined  (cut-off  of  0.05  μg/mL  for  ELISA 
and 8 for OPA). 
Functional  anti-meningococcal  serogroup  activity  (rSBA-MenA,  rSBA-MenC,  rSBA-MenW-135, 
rSBA-MenY) was determined by a serum bactericidal test according to the Centres for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) The cut-off of the assay was a dilution of 1:8.  
Memory B-cell detection 
Whole blood (5.0 mL) was collected from a subset of subjects from each group at Visit 2 and 
Visit 3 for memory B-cell detection analysis for selected serotypes.  
Synflorix P46 012.1 
Page 3/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  B-cell  enzyme-linked  immunospot  (ELISPOT)  assay  allowed  the  quantification  of  antigen 
specific memory B-cells after in vitro differentiation of memory B-cells into antibody secreting 
plasma cells. The results were expressed as the frequencies of antigen-specific memory B-cells 
within the total memory B-cell population. 
Nasopharyngeal swabs 
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at Visit 1 in all groups and before administration of the 
additional dose or first dose of the 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine, as applicable. 
The  occurrence  of  S.  pneumoniae  and  H.  influenzae  in  the  nasopharynx,  at  31-44  months  of 
age  and  prior  to  the  single/first  dose  of  investigational  vaccine  at  40-48  months  of  age  was 
measured: 
  Occurrence  of  S.  pneumoniae  serotypes  (vaccine,  cross-reactive  or  other  serotypes) 
and/or H. influenzae in the nasopharynx. 
  Acquisition of new S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae strains in the nasopharynx. 
Safety /reactogenicity: 
Occurrence of each solicited adverse event within 4 days after each vaccination. 
Local (any, grade 3) adverse events. 
General (any, grade 3, related) adverse events. 
Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 31 days after each vaccination. 
Occurrence of serious adverse events during the entire study period. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity: 
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  antibody  persistence  or  on 
the  ATP  cohort  for  analysis  of  immunogenicity  according  to  the  objective.  A  second  analysis 
based  on  the  Total  vaccinated  cohort  was  also  performed  to  complement  the  ATP  analysis  of 
immunogenicity. Immunogenicity was analysed according to the pooled primed group, each of 
the primed groups (AP-AP group and NAP-pre group) and the Unprimed group.  
Confirmatory Inferential analysis 
95% CIs for the ELISA GMCs ratio (GMCs from the pooled primed groups over GMCs from the 
unprimed  group),  7  to  10  days  following  vaccination  at  Month  9  with  10Pn-PD-DiT,  were 
computed  for  each of  the 10  vaccine  pneumococcal serotypes,  using  an  ANOVA  model  on the 
logarithm10 transformation of the concentrations (pooled variance). The primary objective was 
reached  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  on  these  ELISA  GMC  ratios  was  above  1  for  all  10 
vaccine pneumococcal serotypes. 
Summary of Results 
Immunological memory 
Anamnestic response to an additional vaccine dose was demonstrated in children 40-48 months of age 
who  had  been  primed  and  boosted  in  studies  10PN-PD-DIT-010  and  10PN-PD-DIT-014.  The  primary 
objective  was  reached  as  the  LL  of  the  95%  CI  around  the  GMC  ratios  (pooled  primed  group  over 
unprimed group) was higher than the value ‘1’ for all 10 vaccine serotypes (LL ranging from 2.38 for 
serotype 4 to 27.59 for serotype 23F) (Table 3).

Assessor’s comment from P046 012:  
The  additional  dose  given  at  40-48  months  of  age  resulted  in  substantial  immune  responses 
both  measured  by  ELISA  and  OPA.  The  resulting  antibody  levels  were  clearly  higher  than  the 
responses  to  a  single  dose  in  previously  unvaccinated  subjects.  The  responses  to  a  single 
booster dose were also higher than the response to two catch-up doses for most serotypes. It 
is  recognised  that  the  pre-additional  dose  titres  were  higher  in  the  primed  group,  than  in  the 
unprimed  group,  but  the  rapid  responses  resulting  in  high  antibody  titres  are  indicative  of 
immunological memory.  
The immune responses to two catch-up doses are considered satisfactory, and supporting the 
current SPC recommendations. The OPA titres appear to decrease following the second catch-
up dose, which could be explained by IgM levels in the early response, that are highly effective 
opsonising antibodies. They are then replaced by IgG, which ensure a longer lasting protection. 
As expected the same apparent decrease in response was not seen for the IgG results.  
Seven  days  after  vaccination  at  least  99.5%  of  subjects  in  the  primed  groups  had  antibody 
concentrations  ≥0.20  µg/mL.  In  the  unprimed  group,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibody 
concentrations ≥0.20 µg/mL 7 days after a first dose of Synflorix was at least 51.0% for serotypes 6B 
and 23F, 79.9% to 87.6% for serotypes 5, 9V and 14 and at least 96.6% for serotypes 1, 4, 7F, 18C 
and 19F. In the pooled primed groups, a 9.6- to 64.8-fold increase in antibody GMC was observed after 
vaccination compared to prior to vaccination. 
In the individual primed groups, at least 99.1% of subjects in the AP-AP group and 100% of subjects in 
the  NAP-pre  group  had  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.20  µg/mL  after  the  additional  dose.  For  each 
vaccine  serotype,  the  ELISA  GMC  increased  by  between  9.8-  and  72.1-fold  in  the  AP-AP  group,  and 
between 9.3- and 59.9-fold in the NAP-pre group. 
Although  both  primed  groups  showed  an  immune  response  indicative  of  immunological  memory 
following  an  additional  dose  of  Synflorix,  the  observed  ELISA  GMC  in  the  group  that  had  received 
prophylactic  use  of  antipyretics  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-010  tended  to  be  lower  for  each  vaccine 
serotype than the group that did not receive prophylactic antipyretics. 
The  demonstration  of  immunological  memory  measured  through  the  additional  dose  of  Synflorix  was 
confirmed by the assessment of functional responses. At least 99.5% of primed subjects had OPA titres 
≥8  after  the  additional  dose  in  the  primed  group  while  the  percentages  were  lower  in  the  unprimed 
group after a single dose (at least 95.8% except for serotypes 5 [88.5%] and 6B [90.2%]). An 18.0- 
to  1506.8-fold  increase  in  OPA  GMTs  was  observed  in  the  primed  groups  compared  to  the  pre-
vaccination timepoint. At least 97.9% of subjects in the AP-AP group and 100% of subjects in the NAP-
pre group had OPA titres above the threshold after the additional dose. 
For  each  vaccine  serotype,  the  OPA  GMT  increased  by  between  16.7-  and  2029.6-fold  in  the  AP-AP 
group, and between 19.4- and 1097.5-fold in the NAP-pre group. Postvaccination OPA GMTs in the AP-

AP  group  were  high,  and  although  the  observed  GMT  was  lower  than  the  NAP-pre  group  for  some 
serotypes, the 95% CI overlapped in all cases. 
Immunological  memory  was  also  demonstrated  for  the  immune  responses  against  Protein  D  (PD) 
following the additional dose of Synflorix. After vaccination, 99.5% of subjects in the primed group had 
anti-PD  antibody  concentrations  ≥100  EL.U/mL.  In  the  AP-AP  and  NAP-pre  groups,  the  percentages 
were 99.1% and 100% of subjects, respectively.  
Persistence of antibodies and OPA prior to the additional dose 
The  analysis  of  persistence  2-3  years  after  completion  of  the  primary  vaccination  course  in  study 
10PN-PD-DIT-010 was performed on the ATP cohort for antibody persistence.  
Prior  to  the  additional  Synflorix  dose,  for  each  vaccine  serotype  at  least  93.4%  of  subjects  in  the 
pooled primed group had antibody concentrations above or equal to the assay cut-off of 0.05 µg/mL. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  pooled  primed  group  with  antibody  concentrations  ≥0.20  µg/mL 
prior to the additional dose was 51.4% for serotype 1 and 41.1% for serotype 4, ranged from 70.0% 
to 80.6% for serotypes 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 18C and 23F and was at least 88.8% for serotypes 14 and 19F. 
The percentage of subjects in the AP-AP group with antibody concentrations ≥0.20 µg/mL prior to the 
additional dose was 42.7% for serotype 1 and 32.7% for serotype 4, ranged from 63.9% to 74.5% for 
serotypes 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 18C and 23F and was at least 84.4% for serotypes 14 and 19F. In the NAP-
pre group, the percentages were 60.4% for serotype 1 and 50.0% for serotype 4, ranged from 75.2% 
to 84.0% for serotypes 5, 6B, 7F, 9V and 23F and at least 91.5% for serotypes 14, 18C and 19F. 
For most vaccine serotypes, a decline in antibody GMCs was observed between 12 months and 25-36 
months post-booster vaccination in the pooled primed group. 
The percentage of subjects in the pooled primed group with OPA titres ≥8 prior to the additional dose 
was at least 28.5% for serotypes 1, 4, 5 and 18C, at least 73.6% for serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F and at 
least  87.0%  for  serotypes  7F,  9V  and  14.  As  observed  with  ELISA  GMCs,  the  OPA  GMTs  decreased 
between 12 months and 25-36 months post-booster vaccination. The percentage of subjects with OPA 
titres ≥8 prior to the additional dose was at least 21.6% in the AP-AP group and at least 35.7% in the 
NAP-pre group for serotypes 1, 4, 5 and 18C, at least 64.5% in the AP-AP group and at least 74.7% in 
the NAP-pre group for serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F and at least 84.4% in the APAP group and at least 
89.9% in the NAP-pre group for serotypes 7F, 9V and 14. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  antibodies  against  PD  (≥100  EL.U/mL)  prior  to  the  additional  dose 
vaccine was 92.4% in the pooled primed group. The percentage of subjects above the threshold prior 
to the additional dose was 85.0% in the AP-AP group and 100% in the NAP-pre group. 
2-dose catch-up vaccination 
After  two  catch-up  doses  at  40-48  months  of  age  and  42-50  months  of  age,  respectively,  the 
percentage of subjects in the unprimed group with antibody concentrations ≥0.20 µg/mL was at least 
99.5%  except  for  serotypes  6B  (92.3%)  and  23F  (94.3%).  ELISA  antibody  GMCs  were  higher  than 
prior  to  vaccination.  Using  OPA,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  titres  ≥8  was  at  least  90.4%.  OPA 
GMTs  after  the  second  dose  were  also  higher  than  prior  to  vaccination.  For  anti-PD  responses,  the 
percentage  of  subjects  above  the  cut-off  was  83.8%  after  the  first  dose  and  98.6%  after  the  second 
dose. 
MAH discussion and conclusion: 
The  primary  objective  of  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042,  which  was  to  demonstrate  induction  of 
immunological  memory  at  40-48  months  of  age  by  administration  of  an  additional  dose  of  Synflorix, 
was  met.  The  study  results  confirm  the  previous  demonstration  of  an  anamnestic  response  after 
primary vaccination with Synflorix in study 10PN-PD-DIT-046 in which children primed in a 2+1 or 3+1 
schedule received a single dose of Synflorix during the 4th year of life (Silfverdal, 2011). Study 10PN-
PD-DIT-046  also  showed  that  catch-up  vaccination  with  two  doses  of  Synflorix  in  4th  year  of  life 
induced  robust  increases  in  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  for  each  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotype 
compared to pre-vaccination levels. 
Evaluation of antibody titres 7-10 days post-dose 1 of the catch-up schedule was done for comparison 
with the Primed group and these data are not useful in evaluating the response to the 2-dose catch-up 
regimen.  However,  it  is  noteworthy  that  a  decrease  in  OPA  GMTs  was  observed  for  some  serotypes 
after  the  second  catch-up  dose  compared  to  the  first  dose  in  the  unprimed  group  subjects  in  study 
Synflorix P46 012.1

10PN-PD-DIT-046 (refer to the Type II variation EMEA/H/C/000973/II/0020) and in the present study 
10PNPD-DIT-042. The difference in magnitude of the serotype-specific OPA responses observed 7 days 
after  the  first  dose  and  1  month  after  the  second  dose  likely  reflects  the  kinetics  of  antibody 
production,  which  is  characterised  by  an  initial  high  level  of  IgM  production,  with  highly  effective 
opsonising capacity, while at 30 days post-vaccination opsonisation would be mainly mediated by IgG. 
However,  the  absence  of  specific  information  on  the  kinetics  of  OPA  responses  does  not  allow  firm 
conclusions to be drawn. 
Regardless  of  whether  subjects  had  received  antipyretics  in  studies  10PN-PD-DIT-010  and  10PN-PD-
DIT-014,  all  primed  subjects  demonstrated  anamnestic  response  indicative of  immunological  memory 
following  an  additional  dose  of  Synflorix  at  40-48 months  of  age.  Robust  increases  in  antibody  GMCs 
and  OPA  GMTs  (with  similar  fold  increase  in  ELISA  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs  pre  to  post 
vaccination)  were  observed  for  each  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotype  compared  to  age-matched 
unprimed subjects. Consistent with observations made in studies 10PN-PD-DIT-010 and 10PN-PD-DIT-
014,  the  observed  ELISA  GMCs  tended  to  be  lower  in  the  group  that  had  received  prophylactic 
antipyretics  compared  to  the  group  that  did  not  receive  prophylactic  antipyretics.  This  trend  was 
present but less marked for OPA titres after the additional Synflorix dose in 10PN-PD-DIT-042, possibly 
indicating that the effects of anti-pyretic administration during priming on the magnitude of long-term 
OPA  immune  memory  responses  are  not    as  marked  as  on  ELISA  responses.  In  view  of  the  robust 
immune memory responses observed in both the AP-AP and NAP-pre groups, the clinical relevance of 
differences in the magnitude of the post-vaccination response is not known. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  immune  responses  were  assessed  previously  with  the  following  conclusion: 
The immune responses in the primed group were clearly superior to the responses to a single dose in 
unprimed  children.  The  primed  group  had  higher  antibody  titres  before  the  challenge  vaccination 
compared  to  the  unprimed  group,  but  the  magnitude  of  the  responses  were  clearly  indicative  of 
immunological  memory.  The  response  to  the  challenge  dose  were  also  higher  in  the  primed  group 
compared  to  the  second  dose  in  the  catch-up  group.  This  conclusion  remains,  and  the  conclusions  of 
the  MAH  regarding  persistence  of  antibody  responses  and  catch-up  vaccinations  are  also  agreed. 
Therefore this part of the FUM is considered fulfilled.  
Nasopharyngeal carriage 
The  primary  analysis  was  performed  on  the pooled primed  group  versus  the unprimed  control  group. 
However, in view of the impact of prophylactic paracetamol on the immune responses observed in each 
study  (10PN-PD-DIT-010,  10PN-PD-DIT-014  and  the  follow-up  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042  as  explained 
above),  an  additional  analysis  was  done  for  each  of  the  primed  groups  (AP-AP  group  and  NAP-pre 
group) versus the unprimed group. 
Nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
The occurrence of S. pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal swabs and vaccine efficacy in preventing carriage 
of S. pneumoniae in pooled primed group as well as in the NAP and AP subgroups versus the unprimed 
group is presented in Table 4 and in Figure 2 to Figure 5. Results from studies 10PN-PD-DIT-014 and 
10PN-PD-DIT-042 are presented per visit (e.g. Visit 1 and 2 in study 10PN-PD-DIT-042) and across all 
visits for both studies, for any serotype, vaccine serotypes, cross-reactive serotypes, and non-vaccine 
and non-cross-reactive serotypes respectively. 
The primary analysis showed a positive impact of vaccination with Synflorix in reducing carriage of any 
pneumococcal serotype at Visit 1 and Visit 2 in study 10PN-PD-DIT-042 (i.e.  at 31-44 months of age 
and 40-48 months of age, respectively) and across all visits in studies 10PN-PD-DIT-014 and 10PN-PD-
DIT-042. 
Statistically significant VE against carriage of pneumococcal vaccine serotypes was observed at Visit 1 
and  Visit  2.  The  impact  on  carriage  of  vaccine  serotypes  across  all  visits  was  also  statistically 
significant.  No  significant  impact  was  observed  on  carriage  of  cross-reactive  serotypes  6A  or  19A, 
although  a  positive  trend  was  observed  at  Visit  2  and  across  all  visits.  The  difference  in  carriage  of 
non-vaccine  and  non-cross-reactive  serotypes*  between  Primed  and  Unprimed  groups  was  not 
statistically significant at Visit 2 . 
* the most prevalent non-vaccine and non-cross reactive serotypes detected in carriage samples were 
serotypes  3,  10A,  11A,  15B,  15C,  17F,  22F  and  35F  (individual  serotype  data  shown  in  the  clinical 
study report). In addition, serotypes 8, 10B, 15A, 16F, 24F, 25A, 28F, 29, 31, 33F, 35A, 35B, 35C, 37 
and 38 were also detected during the study.

Serotypes 6B,  19F  and  23F  were  the  most  frequently  isolated  serotypes  in  both  groups.  There  was  a 
trend for lower carriage prevalence of serotypes 6B, 19F and 23F in the Primed versus the Unprimed 
group:  At  each  visit,  the  carriage  prevalence  of  serotype  6B  ranged  between  0.9%  and  2.3%  in  the 
Primed  group,  and  between  2.4%  and  5.3%  in  the  Unprimed  group.  Carriage  prevalence  of  serotype 
19F  ranged  between  1.4%  and  4.7%  in  the  Primed  group  and  between  2.9%  and  6.7%  in  the 
Unprimed group. Carriage prevalence of serotype 23F ranged between 0.5% and 3.2% in the Primed 
group and between 2.4% and 4.8% in the Unprimed group. Statistically significant VE against carriage 
of  pneumococcal  vaccine  serotypes  was  observed  in  the  Primed  group  overall  visits  for  serotypes  6B 
(52.7% [14.8-74.7]), 14 (68.6% [34.4-86.3]), 19F (40.0% [2.7-63.6]) and 23F (46.0% [4.2- 70.4]). 
Similar  trends  were  observed  in  the  AP-AP  and  NAP-pre  groups  (see  the  clinical  study  report  for 
details).  The  analyses  of  the  NAP  and  AP-AP  groups  confirmed  the  primary  analysis.  Both  groups 
showed  statistically  significant  VE  against  carriage  of  pneumococcal  vaccine  serotypes  at  Visit  2  (and 
also at Visit 1 in the NAP group) despite a lower immune response in the AP-AP group subsequent to 
the prophylactic administration of paracetamol. In line with study 10PN-PD-DIT-014, the percentage of 
nasopharyngeal  swabs  positive  for  S.  pneumoniae  (any  serotype,  vaccine  serotypes)  in  both  the  NAP 
and AP-AP groups tended to be lower than in the unprimed group. The percentage of nasopharyngeal 
swabs positive for S. pneumoniae (any serotype, vaccine serotypes) for the subjects in the NAP group 
was comparable to that measured in subjects in the AP-AP group.

Assessor’s comment: These data were presented and assessed in P046 012 and it was concluded that 
vaccination with Synflorix reduces nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes, as shown above. The 
overall  pneumococcal  carriage  is  slightly  reduced,  but  not  statistically  significant,  and  the  carriage  of 
non-vaccine,  non-crossreactive  serotypes  was  slighlty  increased  in  primed  vs  unprimed  groups  (not 
statistically significant).  This indicates that serotype replacement is occurring in a clinical trial setting, 
where the effects of herd immunity are not seen. It is possible that such effects could be greater when 
a large proportion of the population is vaccinated, but no conclusions can be drawn from these data.  
Nasopharyngeal carriage of Haemophilus influenzae and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae 
Figure 6 and Figure 7 present the occurrence in nasopharyngeal swabs of H. influenzae and NTHi and 
VE  in  the  pooled  primed  as  well  as  NAP  and  AP-AP  subgroups  versus  the  unprimed  group.  No 
consistent trend towards  reduction of  carriage of  H. influenzae  was  observed in  the  primary  analysis. 
Across  all  visits,  no  consistent  impact  could  be  observed  on  carriage  of  H.  influenzae.  Similarly,  no 
consistent trends in carriage of NTHi were observed. The results from the NAP and AP-AP groups were 
similar to those of the primary analysis.

Assessor’s comment: The conclusion of the MAH that no effects in carriage of H.influenzae are seen, is 
endorsed.  
Nasopharyngeal carriage of other bacterial pathogens 
Figure 8 to Figure 10 present the occurrence of other bacterial pathogens in nasopharyngeal swabs and 
VE in the pooled primed group as well as the NAP and APAP subgroups versus the unprimed group, per 
visit and overall. Figure 9 and 10 also shows the results for M. catarrhalis, and S. aureus, respectively. 
The occurrence of group A streptococci was also determined but not shown in this AR.  
Carriage prevalence of M. catarrhalis and S. aureus appeared to be similar in each group. At Visit 1 and 
Visit  2  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042,  M.  catarrhalis  carriage  prevalence  was  respectively  35.2  %  and 
47.6% in the unprimed group and respectively 44.4% and 43.9% in the pooled primed group. For S. 
aureus carriage prevalence was respectively 22.4% and 12.5% in the unprimed group and respectively 
21.3% and 18.9% in the pooled primed group at Visit 1 and Visit 2. The carriage prevalence of Group

A  Streptococcus  in  the  pooled  primed  group  and  the  unprimed  group  was  low  compared  to  that 
measured  for  other  bacteria.  Across  all  time-points  in  studies  10PN-PD-DIT-014  and  10PN-PD-DIT- 
042, no consistent trend on the carriage of any other bacterial pathogens between the pooled primed 
group  and  the  unprimed  group  was  observed.  The  analyses  of  the  NAP  and  AP-AP  subgroups  are 
similar to those described for the pooled primed group.

Assessor’s comment: Please note that the “occurrence of all other bacterial species” does not include 
M.  catarrhalis,  S.  aureus  or  group  A  streptococcus.  There  was  no  consistent  trend  of  replacement  of 
other bacterial species in this study.  
MAH discussion of carriage results (summarised) 
The  results  presented  here  confirm  the  impact  of  Synflorix  in  reducing  carriage  of  pneumococcal 
vaccine types that was observed in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014 up to 1 year post booster. While Synflorix 
showed a trend for a positive impact on the carriage of cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A measured 
in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014, this was not sustained over the additional 2-year follow-up period in study 
10PN-PDDIT-042.  The  trend  towards  an  increase  of  carriage  of  non-vaccine  and  non-cross  reactive 
types observed in study 10PN-PD-DIT-014 was sustained in study 10PN-PD-DIT 042.  
The  impact  of  Synflorix  on  S.  pneumoniae  carriage  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042  is  consistent  with 
observations  made  with  other  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccines  (PCVs).  Overall,  PCVs  have  been 
observed  to  reduce  the  prevalence  of  nasopharyngeal  carriage  of  vaccine  serotypes  by  40%  to  50% 
(O'Brien, 2008). The effect has been observed after the primary vaccination series, as well as up to 24 
months  post-booster  vaccination.  Increases  in  carriage  of  non-vaccine,  non-cross-reactive  serotypes 
have also been observed following implementation of PCV vaccination programmes.  
The current results are supported by a post-marketing study before and after introduction of Synflorix 
in  Kenya.  Synflorix  was  introduced  into  routine  infant  immunisation  in  a  3+0  schedule  (6,  10,  14 
weeks  of  age)  and  a  two-dose  catch-up  for  under  5-year-old  children  was  implemented  in  Kilifi. 
Statistically  significant  declines  in  carriage  of  vaccine  serotypes  were  observed  in  500  randomly 
selected  residents  after  Synflorix  introduction  (Hammitt,  2012).  The  prevalence  of  S.  pneumoniae 
vaccine  serotype  carriage  decreased  in  children  <1  year  of  age  from  44%  prior  to  the  vaccination 
programme  to  10%  after  vaccination  (p<  0.001),  and  in  children  1-4  years,  from  29%  to  16% 
(p=0.01).  
To date there are few reports that assess the impact of PCVs against pneumococcal carriage beyond 24 
months  of  age.  Madhi  et  al.  (2007)  investigated  the  long-term  effect  of  a  9-valent  PCV  on  vaccine-
serotype carriage in HIV uninfected and HIV-infected South African children after a primary series of 3 
doses. They found no effect on carriage of vaccine serotypes by 5.3 years of age, and concluded that 
the  levels  of  antibodies  after  3  doses  are  likely  to  be  lower  than  the  threshold  necessary  to  prevent 
colonisation.  An  observational  study  in  the  United  Kingdom  found  no  effect  of  PCV7  on  carriage  of 
pneumococcus  in  children  2-5  years  of  age  who  had  received  a  3-dose  primary  series  and  23-valent 
Synflorix P46 012.1

polysaccharide vaccine booster at 13 months of age (Lakshman, 2003). In a US study, nasopharyngeal 
carriage in American Indians vaccinated with a 3-dose primary series of PCV7 and a fourth PCV7 dose 
at 12–15 months of age, was evaluated after a median of 27 months (range 12–48 months) after the 
last  dose.  The  rate  of  vaccine-type  pneumococcal  carriage  was  lower  among  vaccine  recipients 
(10.7%) than among controls (17.7%). It was also observed that the prevalence of non-vaccine type 
carriage  was  higher  among  vaccine  recipients  (39.3%)  than  among  controls  (29.9%).  Similarly,  a 
Finnish study reported a reduction in vaccine-type carriage 3–4 years after a 4-dose vaccination series 
with  PCV7  (O’Brien,  2008).  Taken  together  the  available  results  of  studies  that  assessed  long  term 
carriage  follow-up  suggest  that  the  use  of  a  booster  dose  of  PCV  following  the  primary  series  may 
provide  a  higher  immune  response  and  therefore,  longer  duration  of  protection  against  vaccine-type 
carriage.  
There was no evidence of a statistically significant negative impact of vaccination on carriage of non-
vaccine,  non-cross-reactive  pneumococcal  serotypes  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042.  In  view  of  the  small 
sample  size  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042,  and  the  lack  of  power  for  carriage  endpoints,  no  conclusions 
can be drawn. As the consequences of serotype replacement depend on many factors including vaccine 
coverage,  it  is  not  possible  to  draw  conclusions  on  the  clinical  consequences  of  potential  serotype 
replacement from this type of data.  
In the primary analysis of carriage of H. influenzae and NTHi in study 10PN-PD-DIT-042, no consistent 
impact of Synflorix on carriage was observed. Previous studies on the impact of Synflorix on carriage 
of H. influenzae and NTHi have provided mixed results. In the POET trial conducted with PCV11-PD, an 
impact  on  H.  influenzae  carriage  was  observed  3  months  after  the  booster  dose  (e.g.  VE  of  42.6%), 
whereas  only  a  positive  trend  could  be  demonstrated  against  carriage  of  NTHi.  The  reduction  in 
nasopharyngeal  carriage  rates  started  to  wane  during  further  follow-up  period  until  24-27  months  of 
age  (Prymula,  2010).  These  results  were  not  reproduced  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-014  across  all  visits, 
although  a  significant  positive  impact  on  the  carriage  of  H.  influenzae  and  NTHi  was  observed  12 
months after the booster dose. Important differences in the design of these two studies (for example, 
differences in study duration, absence of a randomised age-matched control in studies 10PN-PD-DIT-
014  and  10PN-PD-DIT-042,  and  lack  of  power  to  evaluate  the  carriage  endpoint  in  these),  make  it 
difficult to directly compare these carriage results . A significant decline in H. influenzae carriage was 
detected  before  and  after Synflorix  introduction  in  Kenya  in  children  <10  years  of  age  after  Synflorix 
introduction (Hammitt, 2012). 
Conclusions:  
An additional dose of Synflorix induced immunological memory, with results consistent with a previous 
study  (10PN-PD-DIT-046,  Silfverdal,  2011).  Regardless  of  whether  subjects  had  received  antipyretics 
in study 10PN-PD-DIT-010, all primed subjects demonstrated induction of immunological memory. An 
impact  of  antipyretics  on  the  magnitude  of  the  immune  responses  was  observed,  but  there  was  no 
apparent  impact  on  carriage  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  reduced  magnitude  of  the  immune 
response remains unknown. 
Although  this  study  was  not  specifically  powered  to  detect  a  difference  in  carriage  rates,  the  results 
provide  evidence  of  an  impact  of  Synflorix  against  vaccine-serotype  nasopharyngeal  carriage  that  is 
sustained until the fourth year of life. Furthermore, study 10PN-PD-DIT-042 provides the first evidence 
of the persistence of this effect up to 36 months after vaccination. There was no statistically significant 
impact  of  Synflorix  on  carriage  of  non-vaccine,  non-cross-reactive  serotypes,  although  replacement 
with  non-vaccine  serotypes  could  not  be  ruled  out  and  the  limitations  of  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042  in 
terms  of  sample  size  and  power  considerations  do  not  allow  conclusions  to  be  drawn.  There  was  no 
apparent  impact  of  Synflorix  on  carriage  of  H.  influenzae  and  NTHi  in  study  10PN-PD-DIT-042.    No 
consistent impact on carriage of other bacterial pathogens was observed over 36 months of follow-up. 
Synflorix given to children 40-48 months as a 2-dose catch-up vaccination was immunogenic and well 
tolerated.  The  Company  does  not  plan  to  submit  a  variation  for  this  study  and  considers  that  the 
benefit risk profile for Synflorix remains positive in view of these data. 
Safety results 
Solicited local adverse events 
During  the  4-day  post-vaccination  period,  pain  was  the  most  frequently  reported 
solicited  local  AE  in  the  primed  groups  (67.0%  in  the  AP-AP  group  and  62.0%  in  the 
NAP-pre group) and in the Unprimed group (60.9% overall/dose). Grade 3 solicited local 
AEs  were  reported  by  6.3%  (pain)  to  11.6%  (redness)  of  subjects  and  4.6%  (pain)  to 
Synflorix P46 012.1

11.1%  (redness)  of  subjects  in  the  AP-AP  and  NAP-pre  groups,  respectively,  and 
following 3.8% (swelling) to 7.9% (redness) of doses in the Unprimed group. 
Solicited  local  AEs  were  reported  in  the  Unprimed  group  by  35.0%-67.3%  of  subjects 
and  by  29.3%-54.5%  of  subjects  after  the  first  and  second  dose  of  10Pn-PD-DiT 
vaccine, respectively. 
Solicited general adverse events 
During the 4-day post-vaccination period, drowsiness was the most frequently reported 
solicited  general  AE  in  the  primed  groups  (36.6%  of  subjects  in  the  AP-AP  group  and 
31.5%  of  subjects  in  the  NAP-pre  group)  and  in  the  Unprimed  group  (31.2% 
overall/dose).  Grade  3  solicited  general  AEs  were  reported  by  maximum  0.9%  of 
subjects  in  the  AP-AP  and  NAP-pre  groups  and  following  maximum  1.3%  of  doses 
(overall/dose) in the Unprimed group. 
Solicited general AEs were reported in the Unprimed group by 10.3%-35.4% of subjects 
and by 4.1%-27.0% of subjects after the first and second dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT vaccine, 
respectively. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
In the 31-day follow-up period after vaccination, 21.4%, 26.9% and 32.7% of subjects 
in  the  AP-AP,  NAP-pre  and  Unprimed  group,  respectively,  reported  at  least  one 
unsolicited  AE.  In  the  Unprimed  group,  19.1%  of  doses  were  followed  by  at  least  one 
unsolicited AE. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs were reported by maximum 0.9% of subjects per 
group.  No  grade  3  unsolicited  AEs  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally 
related to vaccination. 
Serious adverse events 
No  SAEs  were  reported  during  the  entire  study  period.  Withdrawals  due  to  adverse 
events /serious adverse events No subjects withdrew due to AEs/SAEs in the study. 
Assessor’s  comment:  No  new  safety  signals  were  detected  in  this  study.  The  safety  profile  is  in 
agreement with previous studies.  
III.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
The data provided in this FUM support that immunological memory lasting at least until 40-48 months 
of age is induced by 3-dose priming +a single booster dose at 12 months of age. The responses to a 
single  booster  dose  given  at  40-48  months  of  age  in  the  primed  group  were  clearly  superior  to  the 
responses  to  a  single  dose  in  unprimed  children  of  the  same  age.  The  primed  group  had  higher 
antibody titres  before the challenge  vaccination  compared to the  unprimed group,  but  the  magnitude 
of the responses was clearly indicative of immunological memory. The responses to the challenge dose 
were also higher in the primed group compared to the second dose in the catch-up group.  
There  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  nasopharyngeal  carriage  of  pneumococcal  vaccine 
serotypes over the study period in the primed group compared to the unprimed group (unvaccinated in 
this part of the study). The overall reduction in pneumococcal carriage was less pronounced, and there 
was a slight non-significant increase in non-vaccine serotypes. There was no impact of vaccination with 
Synflorix on the carriage rate of H. influenzae or NTHi. There was no consistent change in carriage of 
other bacterial species in this study.  
The safety data did not indicate any new safety signals.  
In conclusion, this FUM is considered fulfilled and no further action is required.

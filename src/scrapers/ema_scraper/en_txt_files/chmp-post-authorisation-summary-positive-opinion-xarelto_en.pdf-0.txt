On 21 March 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal 
product Xarelto. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Bayer Pharma AG. 
They may request a re examination of the CHMP opinion, provided that they notify the European 
Medicines Agency in writing of their intention within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication for a new strength 2.5mg as follows: 
Xarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine, 
is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Detailed conditions for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after the variation to the 
marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Biliary tract cancer (BTC) refers to a spectrum of invasive adenocarcinomas, including 
cholangiocarcinoma (cancers arising in the intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal biliary tree), and gallbladder 
carcinoma (Valle et al, Lancet 2021; 397: 428–44). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The initially claimed new therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC was: 
IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced 
or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). 
The indication was updated during the procedure to: 
IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults 
with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). 
Epidemiology  
BTCs  are  low-incidence  malignancies  in  most  high-income  countries  (Bridgewater  et  al,  2016a),  but 
represent  a  major  health  problem  in  endemic  areas;  moreover,  the  incidence  of  intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma is rising globally (Valle et al, 2021). Their clinical impact is considerable, since most 
of  them  are  highly  aggressive  and  associated  with  poor  prognosis  (approximately  half  of  untreated 
patients die within 3 to 4 months of presentation) and poor HRQoL (Patel et al, 2011). The incidence of 
BTC varies based on geographic location, but in general, BTC represents a rare malignancy (Valle et al, 
2021)  with  orphan  disease  status  in  the  US,  EU,  and  Japan.  The  strongest  risk  factors  for  BTC  are 
associated  with  chronic  inflammation  within  the  biliary  system  (Marcano-Bonilla,  2016).  Over  75%  of 
BTC  patients  present  at  a  late  unresectable  stage;  therefore,  most  patients  are  eligible  for  first-line 
systemic therapy (Lamarca et al 2014, Takahashi et al, 2013). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Historically, biliary tract cancers are classified according to their anatomical primary site. Cancers arising 
from  bile  ducts  proximal  to  the  second-order  ducts  are  classified  as  intrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma, 
those  originating  between  the  second-order  ducts  and  the  insertion  of  the  cystic  duct  are  perihilar 
cholangiocarcinoma,  and  those  arising  from  epithelium  distal  to  the  insertion  of  the  cystic  duct  are 
termed distal cholangiocarcinoma. The term extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is used to refer to perihilar 
(previously  referred  to  as  Klatskin  tumours,  although  the  use  of  this  term  is  discouraged)  and  distal 
cholangiocarcinoma, collectively. Gallbladder cancers arise from the gallbladder itself or from the cystic 
duct (Valle et al, 2021). 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 9/142 
 
 
 
The presence and nature of symptoms depends on the anatomical location of the primary tumour and 
associated  metastases,  if  present.  Symptoms  arise  as  a  result  of  direct  compression  (e.g.,  biliary 
obstruction), can be constitutional or due to underlying pathology (e.g., chronic liver disease) (Valle et 
al,  2021).  Because  of  their  non-specificity,  patients  usually  present  with  advanced  stage  disease 
(Tsilimigras  et  al  2020,  Turkes  et  al  2019,  Vogel  et  al  2021).  Patients  can  be  symptomatic,  and 
malignancy is identified incidentally, either through detection of deranged liver function tests or imaging 
undertaken for unrelated reasons (Brindley et al, 2021). 
CT scanning is the main modality for diagnosis and staging of biliary tract cancer. MRI, particularly with 
hepato-specific  contrast  media  and  diffusion-weighted  imaging,  can  provide  detailed  anatomical 
delineation of lesions in the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladder, as well as any vascular involvement. It can 
differentiate between cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, identify small lesions within the 
gallbladder,  and  is  able  to  delineate  the  biliary  tree,  particularly  in  patients  with  a  perihilar 
cholangiocarcinoma.  Endoscopic  retrograde  cholangio-pancreatography  (ERCP)  is  a  well-established 
modality for assessment of the biliary tree, with an imaging diagnostic sensitivity of 74% and specificity 
of  70%;  it  enables  biliary  delineation  and  acquisition  of  brush  cytology  and  biopsies.  Endoscopic 
ultrasound  is  very  useful  for  assessment  and  diagnostic  sampling  of  distal  cholangiocarcinoma  and 
regional lymph nodes. Upon completion of investigations, patients’ disease should be staged according 
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Handbook, 8th edition in order to 
plan treatment (Valle et al, 2021). 
Management 
Surgery is the cornerstone of cure for BTC; the optimal approach depends on the anatomical site of the 
primary tumour and the best outcomes are achieved through management by specialist multidisciplinary 
teams. Unfortunately, most patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Most studies 
in  advanced  disease  have  pooled  the  various  subtypes  of  biliary  tract  cancer  by  necessity  to  achieve 
adequate  sample  sizes;  however,  differences  in  epidemiology,  clinical  presentation,  natural  history, 
surgical therapy, response to treatment, and prognosis have long been recognised (Valle et al, 2021).  
The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin is a widely recognized treatment regimen and has remained 
as first-line  SoC in patients with unresectable and advanced  BTC (NCCN Guidelines 2021, Valle  et al, 
2016 [ESMO], Nagino et al, 2021 [Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guidelines]) but the prognosis 
with  this  treatment  is  still  extremely  poor  (median  OS  of  approximately  1  year)  (Banales  et  al  2020, 
Eckel  and  Schmid  2007,  Valle  et  al  2017,  Yachimski  and  Pratt  2008).  Gemcitabine  plus  oxaliplatin 
(GEMOX) is also considered a standard first-line regimen for advanced BTC in many parts of the word 
(Andre  et  al,  2004).  Other  chemotherapy  combination  and/or  monotherapy  regimens  are  also 
recommended in various guidelines to provide customized care for each patient’s needs (Nagino et al, 
2021, NCCN Guidelines, 2021, Valle et al, 2016). 
Additionally, the identification of distinct patient subgroups harbouring unique molecular alterations with 
corresponding  targeted  therapies  (such  as  IDH1  mutations  and  FGFR2  fusions  in  intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma,  among  others)  is  changing  the  treatment  paradigm.  Pemazyre  (pemigatinib)  as 
monotherapy  is  approved  in  Europe  for  FGFR2-fusion  positive  advanced  cholangiocarcinoma  after 
progression to first line chemotherapy since March 2021 (Pemazyre EPAR). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Imfinzi (durvalumab) is a selective, high affinity human monoclonal antibody of the IgG1κ subclass that 
interferes with the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptors and PD-1 on T cells and cluster of differentiation 
Assessment report

80 (B7.1) on immune cells. The combination of a PD-L1 antagonist with cytotoxic chemotherapy may 
provide a complementary benefit in BTC by mounting an effective antitumor immunity and promoting 
antigen presentation, producing protective T cell responses, and overcoming immunosuppression in the 
tumour  bed  and  lead  to  tumour  destruction  helping  to  prolong  the  early  tumour  responses  seen  with 
cytotoxic agents (Mellman et al 2011, Bracci et al 2014, Rizzo 2021). 
In Europe, durvalumab is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable 
NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, and in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of ES-
SCLC. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The clinical development program in BTC focused on evaluating the potential clinical benefit of adding 
durvalumab to the SoC of Gem/Cis. 
Preliminary clinical activity was observed in patients with advanced BTC who received durvalumab as 
monotherapy in the Phase I, open-label study D4190C00002 (NCT01938612; Study 2; Ioka et al 2019), 
which enrolled patients with heavily pre-treated advanced solid tumours. In 42 Japanese patients with 
advanced or metastatic BTC who had previously received at least one prior line of therapy, ORR (4.8%) 
and  median  OS  (8.1  months)  were  comparable  to  those  observed  in  previously  reported  studies  with 
chemotherapy in a heavily pre-treated population (ORR 3% to 11.8%; OS 6.5 to 7.5 months) (Lamarca 
et al 2014, Kim et al 2017a, Brieau et al 2015, Walter et al 2013). Although the number of responders 
with durvalumab was low (2 patients with PR), for those who had a response it was durable (median 
DoR of 9.7 months). These preliminary clinical results are in line with other immunotherapy studies in 
patients  with  advanced  BTC  that  also  showed  a  low  number  of  responders  combined  with  a  durable 
response  (Ueno  et  al  2018,  Bang  et  al  2019,  Ueno  et  al  2019,  Kim  et  al  2017b,  Klein  et  al  2020) 
suggesting  that  the  addition  of  durvalumab  could  prolong  the  early  tumour  responses  seen  with  SoC 
chemotherapy.  
This  hypothesis  was  supported  by  the  results  of  an  open-label,  externally-sponsored  study 
(NCT03046862;  ESR-O,  Oh  et  al  2020)  that  evaluated  durvalumab  in  combination  with  Gem/Cis  in 
patients  with  previously  untreated  unresectable  or  recurrent  BTC  who  were  suitable  candidates  for 
standard first-line chemotherapy. Observed responses and OS results with D + Gem/Cis (ORR 73.4%, 
median DoR 9.8 months, and median OS 18.1 months) suggested additive and potentially synergistic 
activity when placed in the context of historical studies with Gem/Cis alone (ORR 19% to 26.1%, median 
DoR 5.8 months, and median OS 11.2 to 11.9 months) (Valle et al 2010, Valle et al 2015, Okusaka et 
al 2010).  
These promising results supported the design of phase III TOPAZ-1 trial, intended to assess the efficacy 
and safety of durvalumab in combination with the current SoC Gem/Cis for the first-line treatment of 
patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  BTC.  The  efficacy  and  safety  claims  in  the  proposed 
prescribing information were based on the data from the second interim analysis of this pivotal trial.  
The MAH had held several interactions with the regulatory agencies to support the clinical development 
of durvalumab in the targeted indication. Scientific advice was received from EMA on 31 January 2019 
(procedure  EMEA/H/SA/2752/14/2018/II).  The  proposed  population,  comparator  and  OS  as  primary 
endpoint  were  deemed  acceptable.  Approval  based  on  IA-1  using  ORR  analysis,  even  if  outstanding, 
would be highly unlikely to be successful. The proposed IA-1 ORR analysis was discouraged. The timing 
of  IA-2  OS  analysis  was  considered  appropriate  with  sufficiently  mature  data,  using  an  information 
fraction of 70%. The IA-2 may however over-represent patients with poor prognosis, notably those with 
tumours  expressing  high  levels  of  PD-L1,  with  potential  over-estimation  of  the  population  effect.  The 
Assessment report

Agency  advised  that  patient-reported  outcomes  were  unlikely  to  be  statistically  reliable  to  enable  a 
labelling claim of enhanced tolerability to treatment and QoL outcomes. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
GLP 
N/A 
GCP 
The  MAH  claims  that  their  procedures,  internal  quality  control  measures  and  audit  programs  provide 
reassurance that the clinical study program was carried out in accordance with GCP, as documented by 
the ICH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Durvalumab  (MEDI4736)  is  a  human  monoclonal  antibody  of  the  immunoglobulin  G1  kappa  (IgG1κ) 
subclass that inhibits the interaction of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) with the programmed 
cell death-1 (PD-1) and cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80/B7.1) cell surface receptors. 
Monoclonal antibodies are considered  naturally-occurring products (i.e., they are proteins), which are 
not expected to remain either stable or biologically active in the environment for any significant period 
of time because of their susceptibility to chemical and physical degradation, as well as biodegradation 
by  a  wide  range  of  microflora,  and  various  physical  removal  mechanisms.  Degradation  may  also  be 
triggered  from  exposure  to  uncontrolled  ambient  environmental  conditions  (e.g.,  due  to  desiccation, 
suboptimal pH or temperature, and light exposure). 
Durvalumab is considered to be a non-hazardous, biodegradable product. As such, the environmental 
risk  in  terms  of  use  and  disposal  is  considered  to  be  negligible  and  in  accordance  with  the  guideline 
(CHMP 2006) ERA studies are not submitted. Furthermore, the assessment performed does not indicate 
a requirement to take special precautions during the release to the environment that will result from use 
in patients or disposal of the product. 
Therefore,  it  is  not  considered  necessary  to  include  warnings  or  precautions  within  the  product 
information in relation to environmental risks. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  data  have  been  submitted  in  this  application,  which  is  considered  acceptable.  As 
durvalumab is considered to be a non-hazardous, biodegradable product the environmental risk in terms 
of  use  and  disposal  is  considered  to  be  negligible  and  thus,  in  accordance  with  the  guideline  (CHMP 
2006), ERA studies are not submitted.  
Furthermore,  the  assessment  performed  does  not  indicate  a  requirement  to  take  special  precautions 
during the release to the environment that will result from use in patients or disposal of the product.

2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of durvalumab.  
Considering the above data, durvalumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In 2018 durvalumab (Imfinzi) was approved in the EU for treatment of adults with locally advanced, 
unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease had not progressed following 
platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. 
The PK of durvalumab following administration by IV infusion had been investigated in patients 
enrolled in:  
•  One Phase 1/2 study CD-ONMEDI4736-1108 (Study 1108), 
•  One Phase 2 study D4191C00003 (ATLANTIC), 
•  One Phase 3 study D4191C00001 (PACIFIC).

In study TOPAZ-1, PK data were available for a total of 314 patients in the durvalumab plus Gem/Cis 
group. 
The  geometric  mean  (%CV)  of  peak  concentrations  on  Week  0  was  423.0  μg/mL  (180.0%)  for 
durvalumab 1500 mg Q3W in combination with Gem/Cis. At Cycle 5, the trough and peak concentrations 
were  205.6  μg/mL  (53.04%)  and  604.6  μg/mL  (56.11%),  respectively.  At  Cycle  7,  the  trough 
concentration was 222.8 μg/mL (96.14%), indicating steady-state had been reached by Week 12. 
Bioanalytical methods 
In  the  initial  marketing  authorisation  application  (concerning  treatment  of  patients  with  NSCLC),  the 
immuno-assays for quantification of durvalumab and Soluble Programmed Cell Death Ligand-1 (sPD-L1) 
in human serum samples were validated. The flow cytometry methods for quantification of T, B, NK cells

and for quantification of proliferating T cells in human whole blood were only partly validated and included 
inter-assay precision, short-term stability and drug tolerance. The immuno-assays for detection of Anti-
drug Antibodies (ADAs) and neutralising anti-bodies (nAbs) were all qualitative methods and the testing 
limited. The nAb assay was tested for selectivity as matrix interference in serum from healthy individuals 
and  cancer  patients.  The  ADA  methods  were  not  tested  for  matrix  interference  as  this  had  been 
accounted for in the cut point calculation based on serum from patients with different types of cancer. 
Durvalumab population PK analysis (MS-2022-01) 
The  primary  objectives  of  the  PopPK  analysis  were  (1)  to  characterize  the  PK  of  durvalumab,  using 
TOPAZ-1  data  combined  with  data  from  previous  clinical  trials  that  studies  durvalumab  in  various 
indications (Study 1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, CASPIAN and POSEIDON), (2) to assess the impact of pre-
defined covariates on individual post-hoc PK parameters and (3) to derive individual predicted exposure 
metrics  (AUC  dose1,  Cmax  dose  1,  Cmin  dose  1,  AUCss,  Cmax  ss  and  Cmin  ss)  of  durvalumab  for 
patients participating in the TOPAZ-I study based on individual Empirical Bayes Estimates (EBE) from 
the population PK models. 
The PopPK of durvalumab was characterized based on 2827 patients from the previous dataset, and 314 
patients from TOPAZ-1 study, respectively, resulting a total 3141 patients in the dataset. Seven patients 
were excluded in previous analysis due to physiologically impossible ALB, CrCL or sPD-Ll values. A total 
of 146 below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) samples (1.13%) were excluded from current analysis 
and 13 of them were from TOPAZ-I study. In addition, 2 samples (1.5%) from TOPAZ-1 study were also 
excluded from the analysis due to incorrect PK sample time. Eventually, 12805 serum PK samples from 
3134 patients treated with durvalumab were available in the final dataset for analysis. 
Previously,  the  durvalumab  population  PK  (Population  PK  and  Exposure-Response  Report  (MS-2021)) 
was described by a two-compartment distribution model with time-dependent CL. IIV was included on 
CL, V1 and Tmax. Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error model. The 
previous model included several statistically significant covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination 
therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, and ECOG; and on V1: WT and sex.  
The  previously  established  population  PK  model  was  used  as  initial  model  with  the  same  covariate 
structure. As a first step in the covariate model building, the significance of the previous covariates was 
confirmed.  Then  race,  region  and/or  tumour  type  were  tested  as  covariates  on  selected  model 
parameters.  Significance  levels  of  0.001  was  employed  for  both  backward  elimination  and  forward 
addition. Tumour type was found as an additional significant covariate for durvalumab clearance, other 
covariates and model structure were the same as previous model.  
The  relationships  between  the  covariates  and  the  model  parameters  are  described  in  the  following 
equations: 
where  CLcat.cov,  CLcont.cov  and  CLT,i  represent  the  impact  of  categorical  and  continuous  covariates 
and the individual total CL including the time-dependent decrease of CL respectively.

ALB values and BTC patients, respectively. The impact of WT on Vl was also minimal with a maximum 
change of +22.3% for the 95th percentile of observed WT in the study population.

Figure 7. Effects of covariates on durvalumab Cmin,ss 
The clinical pharmacology properties of durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for 
patients with first-line advanced biliary tract cancers has been characterized with data from a Phase III 
clinical trial (TOPAZ-1) using a previous population PK model developed. 
A  two-compartment  model  with  inter-individual  variability  on  CL  and  V1  and  time-dependency  on  CL 
adequately characterized the experimental data from TOPAZ-1 study. Previously selected covariates in 
the population PK model were included, considering the proportion of patients from TOPAZ-1 (~10%) in 
the overall dataset. Despite the low proportion of patients with biliary tract cancer in the overall dataset, 
tumour  type  was  identified  as  a  significant  covariate  on  CL, which  may  indicate  differences  in  the  PK 
properties due to differences in the disease status/characteristics of populations. Model evaluation based 
on the GOF plots and pc-VPC suggest adequate model performance. Clinical relevance has evaluated on 
CLss  and  Vc,  showing  the  relative  change  on  those  PK  parameters  due  to  the  significant  covariates 
selected in the final population PK model. The impact of covariates on exposure metrics (Cmaxss, Cminss 
and AUCss) was assessed by univariate approach. No relevant changes were observed on durvalumab 
exposure  except  for  female  patients  on  Cmin.  However,  the  slight  increase  of  Cmin  (>20%)  is  not 
expected to lead to changes on efficacy or safety. 
The durvalumab population PK model was updated with sparse data from TOPAZ-1 and pooled with the 
previous dataset (Study 1108, ATLANTIC, PACIFIC, CASPIAN and POSEIDON). A total of 216 PK samples 
were BLQ (1.45%) and were excluded from the analysis, of which 13 of them were from TOPAZ-1. The 
M1-method  for  handling  BLQ  samples  is  considered  acceptable.  An  additional  2  PK  samples  were 
removed due to incorrect PK sampling  time. The final dataset for population  PK modelling analysis of 
durvalumab comprised of 12805 PK samples from 3134 patients.  
The previously established model structure was used as a starting point for the analysis and the statistical 
significance  of  covariates  were  tested  via  backward  elimination.  All  previously  established  covariates 
Assessment report

Page 24/142 
 
 
 
 
were retained. Additionally, race, region and tumour type were tested on CL and V1. Tumour type was 
significant in terms of OFV and retained in the final model. The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-
compartment model with time-dependent CL. Tumour type was significant in terms of OFV and retained 
in the final model. The final model of durvalumab PK was a 2-compartment model with time-dependent 
CL. Residuals were described by a combined additive and proportional error model. IIV was included on 
CL,  V1  and  Tmax  and  %CV  was  low  (28.2%,  24.4%  and  25.0%,  respectively).  Structural  model 
parameters were estimated with good precision (RSE<10%) while covariates were estimated with low-
to-high  precision  (range:  3-185%).  The  final  model  included  the  following  statistically  significant 
covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, ECOG and tumour type; and on 
V1: WT and sex. Covariate effects were estimated with adequate precision except tumour type 1 NSCLC 
(185% RSE), which was retained in the model due to a statistically significant drop in OFV. The 95% 
bootstrap CI of tumour type 1 NSCLC contained the null. Shrinkage was low on CL and V1. Shrinkage 
was  high  on  Tmax  (55.4%).Overall,  the  previously  reported  model  parameter  estimates  were 
comparable to the updated model parameter estimates. 
The final model was evaluated by means of non-parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-
plots and VPCs. Bootstrap convergence rate was not presented. No major model misspecifications were 
indicated by GOF-plots.  
The clinical relevance study did not suggest any clinically relevant impact of covariates on CL at the 5th 
or 95th percentile. In terms of volume of distribution, bodyweight was the only covariate that exceeded 
the  20%  clinical  relevancy  limit  with  a  change  of  22.3%  on  V1  at  the  95th  percentile  of  the  study 
population. The impact of bodyweight on AUC,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss was also investigated by splitting 
bodyweight into quartiles. The study suggested a roughly clinically relevant change on AUC,ss, Cmax,ss 
and Cmin,ss in the lower bodyweight quartile Q1 (+25.3%, +25.7% and +22.8%, respectively) and in 
the higher bodyweight quartile Q4 on Cmin,ss (-20.2%). 
The effect of body weight was allometrically scaled with estimated exponents of 0.338 and 0.515 for CL 
and V1. 
Durvalumab exposure-response modelling analysis (MS-2022-01) 
Exposure-efficacy: For the efficacy analysis, the relationship of overall survival (OS) or progression-free 
survival (PFS) of BTC patients to first dose and/or steady-state Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of durvalumab 
was assessed based on data from durvalumab treatment arm of TOPAZ-1 study. Exposure metrics were 
derived using simulated durvalumab time-course PK profiles based on individual post-hoc PK parameters 
following administration of 1500 mg durvalumab Q3W for 8 cycles then followed by 1500 mg Q4W. A 
total of 314 PK evaluable patients in durvalumab arm were analysed in the exposure response modelling 
analysis.  
OS and PFS were examined with Kaplan-Meier plots stratified by quartiles of exposure of durvalumab. 
Cox proportional hazard (CPH) regression of the OS and PFS was evaluated using durvalumab exposure 
metrics. The base model to which the different exposure metrics were added to include all covariates 
that  had  a  hazard  ratio  statistically  different  from  1  on  the  0.001  significance  level  when  tested 
univariately (likelihood ratio test) and Wald test. Demographic characteristics, baseline covariates and 
exposure  metrics  were  tested  using  a  forward-addition  and  backward-elimination  method  and  with 
significant levels of P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 respectively. 
The final model for OS only included disease status, ALB and NLR as significant covariates (Table 6).

Table 6. Final Cox Proportional Hazard model for Overall Survival   
Only NLR was identified to be significantly related with PFS in this analysis (Table 7). 
Table 7. Cox PH model for Progression-Free Survival 
The exposure-efficacy relationships in the TOPAZ-1 study were explored by Kaplan-Meier plots stratified 
by durvalumab exposure quartiles. CPH models were developed for both efficacy outcomes, OS and PFS, 
and a stepwise covariate selection was performed. CPH models did not identify durvalumab exposure as 
a  statistically  significant  covariate  on  OS  or  PFS.  Disease  status,  albumin  and  neutrophil-lymphocyte 
ratio were identified as significant covariates for OS hazard, while neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was the 
only factor included in the CPH model for PFS. Cmin,ss was identified as statistically significant on PFS 
based on the LRT but removed due to being marginally non-significant in the Wald test (0.003>0.001). 
The  proportional  hazard  assumption  was  not  supported  by  a  non-significant  relationship  between 
residuals and time for covariates NLR and ALB for OS nor for NLR for PFS. Exact p-values were not given. 
The violation of the proportional hazard assumption could maybe be corrected by adding time interaction 
terms with the covariates.  
Exposure-safety:  The  relationship  between  durvalumab  exposure  and  clinical  safety  endpoints  was 
explored  based  on  data  in  the  durvalumab  treatment  arm  from  the  TOPAZ-1  study.  The  graphical 
exploration of the exposure metrics for patients with an AE and patients without any AEs did not reveal 
any relationship between durvalumab exposure and AEs. This initial result was further confirmed by the 
results of the logistic regression analysis, which did not identify any significant impact of the durvalumab 
exposure at 1500 mg dose on the incidence of Grade 3+ treatment-related AEs, Grade 3+ treatment-
related AESis or AEs leading to durvalumab treatment discontinuation. 
Logistic regression modelling did not identify any significant exposure-safety relationship after 
durvalumab administration in the TOPAZ-1 study. 
The final durvalumab population PK model was used to obtain EBEs of individual PK parameters of all 
treated patients from the TOPAZ-1 study. Exposure metrics were derived using simulated durvalumab 
time-course PK profiles based on individual post-hoc PK parameters following administration of 1500 
mg durvalumab Q3W for 8 cycles then 1500 mg Q4W afterwards. 314 patients were included in the ER 
analysis for durvalumab. 
Absorption 
Durvalumab is administered intravenously and the bioavailability is 100%.

Distribution 
Distribution studies have not been conducted for durvalumab.  
In  the  original  application,  a  population  PK  model  was  developed,  which  described  durvalumab  PK 
profiles.  A  2-compartmental  population  PK  model  with  both  linear  and  Michaelis  Menten  nonlinear 
elimination components was initially developed for patients across all dose levels and was later updated 
to a final population PK model with linear elimination at doses ≥10 mg/kg Q2W IV in a posthoc analysis. 
Based on this final model, the mean systemic linear clearance (CL) and central volume of distribution 
(V1)  were  0.266  L/day  and  3.51  L  with  a  modest  between-patient  variability  of  27.3%  and  22.1% 
expressed as CV%, respectively. Based on the analysis population that included all of the patients in the 
final model development and in the external validation (1878 patients), the geometric mean (CV%) Vss 
was  5.64  L  (17.6%).  The  PK  parameters  estimated  by  popPK  analysis  were  consistent  with  the  non-
compartmental analysis in study 1108. 
Figure 8. Geometric mean (geometric SD) PK profile of durvalumab after 10 mg/kg Q2W IV 
administration in PACIFIC, Study 1108, and ATLANTIC 
The estimates of AUCss, Cmin,ss and Cmax,ss following durvalumab 10 mg/kg Q2W were predicted in the Pop 
PK  analysis  to  be:  AUCss  (ug*day/mL):3816  [1562,17800],  Cmax,ss  (µg/mL)  364.1  [200.4,1221]  and 
Cmin,ss (µg/mL) 160 [55.4,839.2] 
Elimination 
No studies regarding durvalumab metabolism have been conducted.  
The primary elimination pathways of durvalumab are protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system 
(RES)  or  target-mediated  disposition.  Durvalumab  is  not  metabolized  in  the  liver  and  not  subject  to 
elimination by P450 enzymes.  
For the 3 initial studies (PACIFIC, Study 1108 and ATLANTIC), the durvalumab serum PK data at the 
durvalumab dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W IV were similar (Figure 9). Durvalumab CL decreased over time 
resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance (CLss) of 8.16 mL/h at Day 365; the decrease in 
CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The terminal half-life (t1/2), based on baseline CL, was 
approximately 18 days. Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK concentration-time profiles of the low-dose cohorts in the dose-escalation phase of Study 1108 
(0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg) show a faster CL. Following the first IV dose, mean maximum 
serum concentration following the first dose (Cmax1) increased in a dose-proportional manner over the 
dose range of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg. Exposure levels at 20 mg/kg Q4W provided similar AUCss levels as 10 
mg/kg  Q2W  over  a  period  of  28  days,  but  a  higher  Cmax  to  Ctrough  ratio.  Mean  area  under  the 
concentration-time curve from time 0 to 14 days (AUC0-14) increased in a greater than dose-proportional 
manner with doses <3 mg/kg and reached linearity at dose ≥ 3 mg/kg Q2W.

Time dependency  
Accumulation  of  durvalumab  was  observed  following  repeated  dosing.  The  mean  Cmax_ss and  Ctrough,ss 
increased  in  an  approximately  more  than  dose-proportional  manner  at  doses  ≤1  mg/kg  Q2W. 
Accumulation of durvalumab was evaluated by the ratio of steady state Cmax and Ctrough (on Day 84 or 
beyond) to those at first dose. Following 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W dose, the mean accumulation ratio for 
Cmax (ARCmax) from the first to eighth dose ranged from 0.64 to 1.87, whereas mean accumulation ratio 
for Ctrough (ARCtrough) ranged from 3.16 to 4.93 (Table 8). 
Table 8. Mean durvalumab pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state (Study 1108) 
In the original Pop PK analysis, a statistically significant decrease in durvalumab linear CL was observed 
over  time  with  a  mean  maximal  reduction  (%  coefficient  of  variation  [CV%])  from  baseline  values  of 
approximately 22.9% (46.3%) resulting in a geometric mean steady state clearance CLss (CV%) of 8.24 
mL/h (37.3%). The time-varying CL was included in the updated pop PK model (model 2). The decrease 
in CLss was not considered clinically relevant, since changes in PK parameters ((AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) 
were < 30% for a typical patient with time-varying CL (reduced CL with an estimate of Tmax = - 0.270) 
compared to a typical patient with time-independent CL (Tmax = 0, CL = 0.266).  
Special populations 
The  effect  of  intrinsic  factors  (i.e.,  race,  age,  renal  impairment,  hepatic  impairment,  sex,  and  body 
weight) on the PK of durvalumab has not been studied in specific dedicated studies. 
Based on pop PK analyses, no covariate showed a significant impact on model parameters CLss and V1. 
Albumin  and  tumor  type  had  the  most  pronounced  impact,  with  a  maximum  change  of  +19.1%  and 
16.6% on CLss for the 5th percentile of observed ALB values and BTC patients, respectively. The impact 
Assessment report

of  body  weight  on  V1  was  moderate  with  a  maximum  change  of  +22.3%  for  the  95th  percentile  of 
observed body weight in the study population.  
Based on simulations performed to predict exposures in patients with body weight range from 30 to 36 
kg, the proposed regimen (1500 mg of durvalumab Q3W × 8 cycles + Q4W) would lead to significant 
higher exposure (>50%) levels of durvalumab at steady state conditions in patients from 30 to 36 kg. 
Therefore, a body-weight dose regimen in patients below 36 kg of body weight was proposed. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab.  
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No  in  vitro  permeability,  in  vitro  metabolism,  or  in  vitro  metabolic  drug-drug  interaction  studies  that 
used human biomaterials have been performed. 
Immunogenicity 
In TOPAZ-1, immunogenicity data were available for a total of 240 patients (ADA-evaluable population) 
in the durvalumab plus Gem/Cis group. Within the ADA analysis set (patients in the safety analysis set 
who had non-missing baseline and at least 1 non-missing post-baseline ADA result), ADA prevalence (16 
[6.7%] patients for the D + Gem/Cis group and 19 [8.2%] patients for the placebo + Gem/Cis group) 
and  ADA  incidence  (2  [0.8%]  vs  7  [3.0%]  patients,  by  respective  treatment  group)  were  low  and 
numerically similar between the D + Gem/Cis and placebo + Gem/Cis group. The low ADA-positive rate 
and low ADA titer observed in the placebo group is consistent with the targeted 1% false-positive rate 
of the ADA assay. Out of 16 ADA-positive patients in the D + Gem/Cis group, 2 patients were treatment-
emergent ADA-positive and 14 patients were ADA-positive at baseline only. Both treatment-emergent 
ADA-positive  patients  were  transiently  positive  with  low  ADA  titer  (maximum  titers  of  4  and  8)  and 
negative for nAb. Only 2 patients in each treatment group were nAb positive. 
The impact of durvalumab ADA on the PK of durvalumab has been evaluated in PopPK modeling based 
on data from TOPAZ-1, POSEIDON, CASPIAN, Study 1108, ATLANTIC, and PACIFIC. In this analysis ADA 
status did not have any influence on durvalumab exposure metrics. Across multiple phase III studies, in 
patients  treated  with  IMFINZI  in  combination  with  chemotherapy,  0%  to  0.8%  of  patients  developed 
treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against durvalumab were detected in 0% to 0.8% of 
patients treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy. The presence of ADAs did not have an 
apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Durvalumab  is  a  selective,  high  affinity  human  mAb  of  the  IgG1κ  subclass  that  interferes  with  the 
interaction  of  PD-L1  with  its  receptors,  PD-1  on  T  cells  and  CD  80  (B7.1)  on  immune  cells.  The 
combination of an PD-L1 antagonist with cytotoxic chemotherapy may provide a complementary benefit 
in  BTC  by  mounting  an  effective  antitumor  immunity  and  promoting  antigen  presentation,  producing 
protective T cell responses, and overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor bed.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In Study 1108, target engagement was assessed by measuring the reduction of free sPD-L1 in serum 
before and following durvalumab administration. sPD-L1 data were available from 851 patients in the 
dose-escalation, dose-exploration, and dose-expansion cohorts following administration of durvalumab 
0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W, 15 mg/kg Q3W, and 20 mg/kg Q4W. Mean baseline sPD-L1 was approximately 
137 pg/mL (range, 67 to 681 pg/mL). Following administration of 0.1 to 20 mg/kg durvalumab, sPD-L1 
concentrations were maximally suppressed at Day 14 (or after the first dose) for all doses except 0.1 
mg/kg. The extent and duration of the suppression was dose dependent. Complete sPD-L1 suppression 
was observed around the dose levels at ≥ 0.3 mg/kg. Following 10 mg/kg Q2W, approximately 97% of 
patients demonstrated complete sPD-L1 suppression throughout the dosing interval. 
Suppression  of  free  sPD-L1  was  similar  among  10  mg/kg  Q2W,  15  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  20  mg/kg  Q4W 
cohorts.  
Similar results were observed in Japan Study 02, where sPD-L1 was completely suppressed in all patients 
following administration of durvalumab 1, 3, 10 mg/kg Q2W, 15 mg/kg Q3W, and 20 mg/kg Q4W. 
Immunogenicity 
The impact of durvalumab immunogenicity on pharmacodynamics was evaluated based on the sPD-L1 
data available from Study 1108 and Japan Study 02. In Study 1108, the post-baseline sPD-L1 serum 
concentrations of the 2 subjects who tested positive for nAb or anti-triple mutation (anti-TM) antibody 
post-baseline  were  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantification,  indicating  that  the  presence  of  treatment-
emergent durvalumab nAb or anti-TM antibody did not impact the pharmacodynamics of durvalumab. 
Similarly, in Japan Study 02, the post-baseline sPD-L1 for the subject who tested positive for durvalumab 
nAb  post-baseline  was  completely  suppressed,  except  for  the  end-of-treatment  and  30-day  follow-up 
samples.  All  other  patients  who  tested  positive  for  durvalumab  ADA  post-baseline  had  complete 
suppression of sPD-L1 throughout the dosing period.  
The  immunogenicity  assessment  did  not  identify  any  significant  trend  in  patients  from  TOPAZ-1 
compared  to  patients  from  previous  studies.  The  overall  incidence  was  lower  than  10%  and  the 
prevalence less than 18%. No significant nAb positive subjects were observed across the different clinical 
trials. Differences in exposure by ADA status should be considered as preliminary due to the low number 
of ADA positive patients from TOPAZ-1 study (n=2). 
Overall,  the  results  from  Study  1108  and  Japan  Study  02  concerning  durvalumab  immunogenicity 
suggest minimal impact of durvalumab immunogenicity on the pharmacodynamic response of free sPD-
L1 suppression following durvalumab treatment.

Exposure-efficacy Relationship 
The  exposure-efficacy  relationships  for  efficacy  (OS  and  PFS)  were  analyzed  based  on  the  data  from 
TOPAZ-1. Only the durvalumab + chemotherapy group was applied in this exposure-efficacy analysis, 
while the placebo arm was used in certain plots for comparison purposes only. 
The  PopPK  model  was  used  to  simulate  individual  durvalumab  exposures  for  each  patient  in  the 
durvalumab  +  Gem/Cis  group  from  TOPAZ-1.  Overall,  6  durvalumab  exposure  metrics  were  explored 
(AUC,dose 1, Cmin,dose 1, Cmax,dose 1, AUCss, Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Durvalumab  is  a  selective,  high  affinity  human  mAb  of  the  IgG1κ  subclass  that  interferes  with  the 
interaction  of  PD-L1  with  its  receptors,  PD-1  on  T  cells  and  CD  80  (B7.1)  on  immune  cells.  The 
combination of an PD-L1 antagonist with cytotoxic chemotherapy may provide a complementary benefit 
in  BTC  by  mounting  an  effective  antitumor  immunity  and  promoting  antigen  presentation,  producing 
protective T cell responses, and overcoming immunosuppression in the tumor bed. 
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab as monotherapy has previously been described adequately. 
The clinical pharmacology properties of durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for 
patients with first-line advanced biliary tract cancers has been characterized with data from a Phase III 
clinical  trial  (TOPAZ-1)  using  a  previous  population  PK  model  developed.  The  modelling  strategy  is 
endorsed,  since  it  allows  to  re-use  and  apply  the  previous  knowledge  of  the  structural  and  covariate 
effects of durvalumab to describe its time-course in patients with biliary tract cancer. 
The durvalumab population PK model was updated with sparse data from TOPAZ-1 and pooled with the 
previous  dataset  (Study  1108,  ATLANTIC,  PACIFIC,  CASPIAN  and  POSEIDON).  The  final  model  of 
durvalumab  PK  was  a  2-compartment  model  with  time-dependent  CL  and  included  the  following 
covariate effects on CL: WT, ALB, combination therapy, sex, CrCL, LDH, ECOG and tumour type; and on 
V1: WT and sex.  
The effect of body weight was less than proportional. The final model was evaluated by means of non-
parametric bootstrap analysis (n=1000), RSEs, GOF-plots and pcVPCs. No major model misspecifications 
were indicated by GOF-plots. Slight misspecification was noted at the lower range of observations but 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 45/142 
 
 
 
 
 
this is considered of minor importance. The pcVPC of durvalumab concentration vs. time indicated that 
the predicted data was consistent with the observed percentiles in TOPAZ-1. 
Clinical relevance was evaluated on CLss and Vc, showing the relative change of those PK parameters 
due to the significant covariates selected in the final population PK model. The impact of covariates on 
exposure  metrics  (Cmaxss,  Cminss  and  AUCss)  was  assessed  by  univariate  approach.  No  relevant 
changes were observed on durvalumab exposure except for female patients on Cmin. However, the slight 
increase of Cmin (>20%) is not expected to lead to changes on efficacy or safety. 
The final durvalumab population PK model was used to obtain EBEs of individual PK parameters of all 
treated patients from the TOPAZ-1 study. All derived exposure metrics are endorsed.  
The  exposure-response  analyses  were  conducted  on  different  efficacy  (OS  and  PFS)  and  safety  (AEs, 
AESIs  or  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation)  variables.  The  exploratory  analysis  (Kaplan-Meier  plots) 
indicates no relevant trends between exposure after first dose and steady-state and efficacy endpoints 
(OS or PFS) since no clear differentiation between exposure quartiles (AUC, Cmax or Cmin) was observed 
with the placebo arm. Therefore, no relevant exposure-efficacy relationship was established in patients 
with biliary tract cancer and durvalumab at the proposed dosing regimen (1500 mg Q3W). 
CPH models were developed for both efficacy outcomes, OS and PFS, and a stepwise covariate selection 
was performed. CPH models did not identify durvalumab exposure as a statistically significant covariate 
on OS or PFS. The proportional hazard assumption was not supported by a non-significant relationship 
between residuals and time for covariates NLR and ALB for OS nor for NLR for PFS and these models 
should be interpreted with caution.   
The Cox proportional-hazards model analysis identified disease status, ALB and NLR as the significant (p 
<  0.001)  prognostic  factors  for  the  OS  hazard.  NLR  was  identified  as  the  significant  (p  <  0.001) 
prognostic factor for the PFS hazard. The exposure of durvalumab was not considered as a significant 
covariate for OS or PFS (p < 0.001). 
Regarding the exposure-safety analysis, no significant exposure and safety events was established based 
on  the  95%  CI  of  the  estimate.  The  exposure-safety  analysis  was  adequately  conducted,  evaluating 
exposure metrics after first-dose and at steady-state conditions (AUC, Cmax and Cmin). Therefore, no 
differences in the incidence or prevalence of safety events were associated to differences in durvalumab 
exposure.  At  the  same  time,  the  probability  of  safety  events  was  low  across  the  exposure  range 
evaluated (<20%), demonstrating the adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen. None of the evaluated 
durvalumab exposure metrics were identified to have an influence on safety events. 
No clinically relevant E-R relationship was observed between durvalumab PK exposure and the safety 
endpoints of adverse events of Grade 3 and above treatment-related AE, Grade 3 and above treatment-
related AESI, or AE leading to treatment discontinuation in durvalumab treated patients. 
The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  in  special  populations  is  considered  adequate  and  typical  for  a 
protein drug product being administered intravenously. The effect of hepatic and renal impairment was 
not  formally  tested  in  dedicated  clinical  trials;  this  is  acceptable  since  durvalumab  is  a  human  IgG 
antibody, which is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways 
in the same way as endogenous IgG. 
PK drug-drug interaction of durvalumab with other therapeutics is not anticipated given that durvalumab 
is  not  primarily  cleared  via  hepatic  or  renal  pathways;  instead,  the  primary  elimination  pathways  are 
protein catabolism via reticuloendothelial system (RES) or target-mediated disposition. Durvalumab is 
not expected to induce or inhibit the major drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 pathways.

In  TOPAZ-1,  ADA  prevalence  was  6.7%  (16/240).  ADA  incidence  was  0.8%  (2/240).  2/240  (0.8%) 
patients were nAb positive. These results are consistent with results from previous studies. The impact 
of  durvalumab  ADA  on  the  PK  of  durvalumab  was  evaluated  in  a  PopPK  analysis  based  on  data  from 
TOPAZ-1, POSEIDON, CASPIAN, Study 1108, ATLANTIC, and PACIFIC. In this analysis ADA status did 
not have any influence on durvalumab exposure metrics. In addition, immunogenicity results from Study 
1108 and Japan Study 02 in terms of sPD-L1 data suggest minimal impact of durvalumab immunogenicity 
on the pharmacodynamic response of free sPD-L1 suppression following durvalumab treatment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of durvalumab has overall been adequately described.

2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The final durvalumab population PK model was used to obtain EBEs of individual PK parameters of all 
treated patients from the TOPAZ-1 study. Exposure metrics were derived using simulated durvalumab 
time-course PK profiles based on individual post-hoc PK parameters following administration of 1500 mg 
durvalumab  Q3W  for  8  cycles  then  1500  mg  Q4W  afterwards.  Please  refer  to  section  Dose  response

2.4.2.  Main study 
TOPAZ-1 
A Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-regional, international 
study of durvalumab in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus placebo in 
combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for patients with first-line advanced biliary 
tract cancers (BTCs) 
TOPAZ-1  is  an  ongoing,  phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multi-centre, 
international  study  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  durvalumab  in  combination  with  SoC 
gemcitabine  plus  cisplatin  chemotherapy  (D  +  Gem/Cis)  vs  SoC  chemotherapy  alone  (placebo  + 
Gem/Cis)  as  first-line  treatment  in  patients  previously  untreated  for  unresectable  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic BTC.  
An  IDMC  composed  of  independent  experts  was  convened  to  review  safety  assessments  and  make 
recommendations to continue, amend, or stop the study based on safety findings. At IA-1 and IA-2, the 
IDMC  was  responsible  for  also  reviewing  unblinded  efficacy  data  and  providing  their  opinion  as  to 
minimum efficacy criteria being met along with the demonstration of an acceptable safety profile.

Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cisplatin 25 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 
(each administered on Days 1 and 8; Q3W) in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg (D + Gem/Cis) 
or placebo (placebo + Gem/Cis) via IV infusion (on Day 1; Q3W); starting on Cycle 1, for up to 8 
cycles. After completing the chemotherapy induction period, patients received maintenance treatment 
with durvalumab or placebo Q4W until clinical or radiological (per RECIST v1.1) disease progression or 
until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or any other discontinuation criteria were met. 
Patients who were clinically stable at initial disease progression could continue to receive study 
treatment at the discretion of the investigator and patient (Figure 21). Cross-over was not allowed.

The  Gem/Cis  regimen  recommended  for  first-line  BTC  treatment  according  to  NCCN,  ESMO,  and 
Japanese guidelines (NCCN Guidelines 2021, Valle et al 2016, Nagino et al 2021) was adopted in this 
study. TOPAZ-1 restricted the administration of Gem/Cis to a maximum of 8 cycles because, historically, 
clinical studies with Gem/Cis in BTC (including the ABC-02 [Valle et al. 2010]) frequently restricted the 
chemotherapy cycle for up to 8 cycles. Whilst several previous clinical studies have allowed more than 
8 cycles of Gem/Cis, the duration of treatment in these studies was similar to ABC-02, in which Gem/Cis 
was restricted for up to 8 cycles (Okusaka et al. 2010, Morizane et al 2019). Moreover, these studies 
yielded similar OS and PFS results compared to studies that restricted Gem/Cis to 8 cycles. These data, 
combined with those of Hyung et al 2019, make the benefit of continuation of Gem/Cis beyond 8 cycles 
unclear (Hyung et al 2019).

Figure 22. Durvalumab or placebo plus gemcitabine/cisplatin dosing schedule
Duration  of  treatment:  Durvalumab  [Arm  A]  or  placebo  [Arm  B]  plus  gemcitabine/cisplatin  was 
administered up to 8 cycles q3w. Patients will subsequently receive durvalumab (Arm A) or placebo (Arm 
B)  q4w  until  clinical  progression  or  RECIST  1.1-defined  radiological  PD,  unless  there  is  unacceptable 
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. During the treatment period, 
patients who are clinically stable at an initial RECIST 1.1-defined radiological PD may have continued to 
receive study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator and patient as long as they are deemed to 
be receiving clinical benefit. 
Assessment of response: Baseline RECIST 1.1 assessments (selection of target lesions and non-target 
lesions)  were  performed  on  images  from  CT  scans  (preferred)  or  MRI  scans,  each  preferably  with  IV 
contrast of the chest, abdomen (including the entire liver and both adrenal glands), and pelvis, acquired 
no more than 28 days before the date of randomization and, ideally, performed as close as possible to 
and prior to the date of randomization. On-study tumour assessments were performed every 6 weeks 
(± 1 week) for the first 24 weeks (relative to the date of randomization) and then every 8 weeks (± 1 
week) thereafter (relative to the date of randomization) until RECIST 1.1-defined radiological PD plus at 
least 1 additional follow-up scan. 
Crossover within the study was not permitted. 
Dose  delays  and  modifications:  Dose  delays  were  permitted  for  durvalumab  (or  placebo)  therapy. 
However,  dose  reduction  for  durvalumab  (or  placebo)  therapy  were  not  permitted.  The  Investigator 
should  have 
followed 
local  standard  clinical  practice 
regarding  dose  modifications 
for 
gemcitabine/cisplatin.

Sample size 
Approximately  672  patients  were  planned  to  be  be  randomized  in  the  Global  Cohort.  Patients  were 
randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B. Once the Global Cohort was closed, sites in China were to continue 
until 130 Chinese patients were randomized. 
The  study  is  powered  to  demonstrate  superiority  in  the  OS  benefit  of  durvalumab  plus 
gemcitabine/cisplatin  (Arm  A)  versus  placebo  plus  gemcitabine/cisplatin  (Arm  B)  in  patients  with 
previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BTC. 
A hypothesis of improved OS was planned to be tested when: 
•  Approximately  397  OS  events  have  occurred  across  Arm  A  and  Arm  B  (59%  maturity) (IA-2) 
AND 
•  Approximately 496 OS events have occurred across Arm A and Arm B (74% maturity) (FA). 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 54/142 
 
 
 
If the true average OS HR is 0.745, corresponding to an approximate 4-month improvement in median 
OS  compared  to  Arm  B  of  11.7  months,  approximately  496  OS  events  will  provide  90%  power  to 
demonstrate statistical significance at the 4.20% level (using a 2-sided log-rank test) for the FA. The 
4.9% (2-sided) alpha allocation for the OS analysis will be controlled at the IA-2 and FA timepoints by 
using the Lan-DeMets (Lan and DeMets 1983) spending function that approximates the O’Brien-Fleming 
approach. 
The  smallest  treatment  difference  that  could  be  statistically  significant  at  the  FA  is  an  average  HR  of 
0.833 using log-rank test, or 2.3-month improvement in median OS. With a log-rank test at IA-2 and a 
FH (0, 1) test at the final analysis, the overall power is at least 86% based on an assumed average HR 
of 0.745 under the assumption of proportional hazards or up to a 6- month delayed effect (i.e., delayed 
separation of the OS curves by up to 6 months). 
Updates to the sample size and the statistical assumptions and the information fraction, maturity, and 
OS events required for IA-2 and FA (CSP Version 4, 17 April 2020) were based solely on non-TOPAZ-1 
data and input from the steering committee and investigators who considered that HR of 0.75 was also 
clinically meaningful and an appropriate target. While progressive changes and clarifications were made 
with respect to the statistical analyses, sample size and assumptions regarding information fractions at 
the IA-2 and FA, these changes were made prior to unblinding and these changes are not considered 
impactful on study integrity. 
Randomisation 
The actual treatment given to patients was determined by the randomization scheme in the IVRS/IWRS. 
A  blocked  randomization  was  generated,  and  all  centres  used  the  same  list  in  order  to  minimize  any 
imbalance in the number of patients assigned to each treatment group. 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  disease  status  (initially  unresectable  versus  recurrent)  and  primary 
tumour site (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma versus extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma versus gallbladder 
carcinoma). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind manner. Several measures were implemented to protect the 
blinding. For durvalumab, the IV bag was covered with a translucent coloured or opaque sleeve after 
preparation by the unblinded pharmacist prior to dispensing to other study personnel. The patient, the 
Investigator,  and  study  centre  staff  were  blinded  to  the  durvalumab/placebo  allocation  and  remained 
blinded to each patient’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study.  
No member of the extended study team at AstraZeneca, at the investigational centres, or any blinded 
Contract Research Organization handling data had access to the randomization scheme until the time of 
the final data analysis (i.e., the primary OS analysis) or any interim analysis data where a decision is 
made to unblind the study. Investigators were unblinded to treatment allocation only in cases of medical 
emergency. 
The IDMC was provided with unblinded data for their review, but AstraZeneca staff and Investigators 
involved in the study remained blinded.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations for efficacy 
The full analysis set (FAS) planned to include all randomized subjects. The FAS was planned to be used 
for  all  efficacy  analyses.  Treatment  arms  were  foreseen  to  be  compared  on  the  basis  of  randomized 
study treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Subjects who were randomized but did 
not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were included in the analysis in the treatment arm 
to which they were randomized. The analysis of data using the FAS therefore followed the principles of 
ITT. 
Analysis  of  ORR  was  planned  to  be  based  on  subjects  in  the  FAS  who  have  measurable  disease  at 
baseline.  
Analysis of DoR was planned to be based on subjects in the FAS who achieve objective response. 
For IA-1 an additional analysis set was defined: FAS subjects with an opportunity for at least 32 weeks 
of follow up at the time of IA-1 DCO (FAS-32w, i.e., randomized ≥ 32 weeks prior to IA-1 data cut-off 
(DCO)). 
PRO analysis set: For each patient reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire, a separate analysis set was 
defined. The patient reported outcome analysis set planned to include all subjects from the FAS, except 
for subjects with no questionnaire translation available or who did not complete questionnaires due to 
physical limitations (e.g. blind), illiteracy, or other language reasons. All PRO analyses were foreseen to 
take place using the PRO analysis set.

Source SAP v6 
Assumption of proportionality 
The assumption of proportionality was planned to be assessed. Proportional hazards were planned to be 
tested firstly by examining plots of complementary log-log (event times) versus log (time) and, if these 
raise  concerns,  by  fitting  a  time  dependent  covariate  (adding  a  treatment-by-time  or  treatment  by-
ln(time) interaction term) to assess the extent to which this represents random variation. If a lack of 
proportionality was evident, the variation in treatment effect was to be described by presenting piecewise 
HR calculated over distinct time-periods.  
Sensitivity and supplemental analysis 
•  Attrition bias: A sensitivity analysis for OS was planned to examine the censoring patterns to 
rule out attrition bias with regard to the primary treatment comparisons, achieved by a Kaplan-
Meier plot of time to censoring where the censoring indicator of OS was reversed. 
•  Effect  of  covariates  on  the  HR  estimate  (Cox  proportional  hazards  model):  Cox  proportional 
hazards modelling was planned to be used to assess the effect of covariates on the HR estimate. 
A model was foreseen to be constructed, containing treatment, the stratification factors and the 
following covariates age, sex, race, ECOG and locally advanced versus metastatic BTC, where 
ECOG status is from screening. Interactions between treatment and stratification factors were 
also planned to be tested. 
•  At FA, OS was also planned to be analyzed using a stratified log rank test, adjusting for disease 
status  (initially  unresectable  or  recurrent)  and  primary  tumor  location  (intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma,  extrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma,  or  gallbladder  cancer)  as  sensitivity 
analysis.

EMA/29546/2023

Censoring rules for OS 
Any subject not known to have died at the time of analysis was foreseen to be censored based on the 
last recorded date on which the subject was known to be alive. If there is evidence of death but the date 
is entirely missing, it was to be treated as missing, i.e. censored at the last known alive date. 
A difference in survival between the treatment arms was planned be tested using a stratified log-rank 
test at the IA-2 and a FH (0,1) test at the final analysis. The stratification factors are the same factors 
used for stratification at randomization. Patients not known to be dead were planned to be censored at 
the last date with survival information. Kaplan-Meier curves were also to be presented. It was planned 
to investigate whether the proportionally assumption was fulfilled primarily using a graphical approach. 
If indication of violation of this assumption were found, piecewise HR would be calculated. Sensitivity 
analysis was planned to be performed to examine the censoring pattern and the effect of covariates on 
the HR. Since the FH (0,1) test was not implemented (the results presented in the CSR correspond to 
the IA-2) this aspect is not discussed in the assessment report. 
Secondary endpoint – INV-PFS 
The analysis was planned to be performed in the FAS using a stratified logrank test, adjusting for disease 
status and primary tumour location. The effect of Arm A versus Arm B was planned to be estimated by 
the HR together with its corresponding 95% CI from stratified Cox proportional hazards model. PFS at 
month 6, month 9, month 12 and month 24 was also to be summarized (using the Kaplan-Meier curve) 
and presented by treatment arm. Kaplan-Meier plots of PFS will be presented by treatment arm. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
Subjects who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis were planned to be censored at the 
time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment. However, if the 
subject progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits, the subject was foreseen to be censored at the 
time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. If the subject had no 
evaluable visits or did not have baseline data, they were to be censored at Day 1 unless they die within 
2 visits of baseline, then they were to be treated as an event with date of death as the event date. 
Sensitivity and supplemental analysis for PFS 
Evaluation-time bias: Sensitivity analyses was planned to be performed to assess possible evaluation-
time bias that may be introduced if scans are not performed at the protocol-scheduled timepoints. The 
midpoint between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment was planned 
to be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test as described for PFS analysis above. For subjects whose 
death was treated as PFS event, the date of death was to be used to derive the PFS time used in the 
analysis.   
Attrition bias was planned to be assessed by repeating the PFS analysis except that the actual PFS event 
times, rather than the censored times, of subjects who progressed or died in the absence of progression 
immediately  following  2  or  more  non-evaluable  tumor  assessments  was  planned  to  be  included.  In 
addition, subjects who take subsequent therapy prior to progression or death were to be censored at 
their last evaluable assessment prior to taking the subsequent therapy. This analysis was foreseen to be 
supported  by  a  Kaplan-Meier  plot  of  the  time  to  censoring  where  the  censoring  indicator  of  the  PFS 
analysis is reversed. 
Effect of covariates on the HR estimate (Cox proportional hazards model)  
Cox-proportional hazards modelling was planned to be used to assess the effect of covariates on the HR 
estimate. A model was planned to be constructed, containing treatment, the stratification factors and 
the  following  covariates  age,  sex,  race,  ECOG  and  BTC,  where  ECOG  status  is  from  screening. 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 59/142 
 
 
 
Interactions between treatment and stratification factors were also to be tested to rule out any qualitative 
interaction using the approach of Gail and Simon. 
The statistical methods implemented to test INV-PFS are similar to those described for OS although with 
different censoring rules. Patients who did not progress/died during the study are censored at the last 
available assessment. Patients who progressed or died after 2 or more missed visits were planned to be 
censored at the time of the latest evaluable assessment. If the subject has no evaluable visits or does 
not have baseline data, they were to be censored at Day 1 unless they die within 2 visits of baseline, 
then they were to be treated as an event with date of death as the event date. Several supplementary 
and sensitivity analyses were planned for PFS. To assess the impact of scans that were not performed 
at  the  protocol-scheduled  timepoints,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  planned  for  PFS  where  the  midpoint 
between the time of progression and the previous evaluable RECIST assessment was analysed using a 
stratified log-rank test. Attrition bias was investigated by performing the PFS analysis using the actual 
PFS event times of subjects who progressed or died in the absence of progression immediately following 
2 or more non-evaluable tumour assessments. In addition, subjects who take subsequent therapy prior 
to  progression  or  death  were  to  be  censored  at  their  last  evaluable  assessment  prior  to  taking  the 
subsequent therapy. A sensitivity analysis was planned to examine the effect of covariates on the HR. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint INV-ORR 
It was planned to compare the ORR between treatment A versus treatment B using a stratified Cochran-
Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test as the primary analysis. The CMH test was foreseen to be stratified using 
the same stratification factors as the primary endpoint. The results of the analysis were planned to be 
presented in terms of a odds ratio and p-value. 
Subjects who discontinue randomized treatment without progression, receive a subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy, and then respond, were not to be included as responders in the ORR. 
At IA-1, the ORR evaluation was planned to be repeated with tumour data as assessed by BICR according 
to  RECIST  1.1  for  the  first  approximately  200  randomized  subjects  who  have  had  opportunity  to  be 
followed up for at least 32 weeks. 
The ORR was planned to be based on the site investigator RECIST 1.1 data and using all scans regardless 
of whether they were scheduled or not. Only confirmed responses were to be reported for ORR at IA-2 
and final analysis.  
Sensitivity analysis for INV-ORR 
ORR was planned to be analysed using logistic regression models adjusting for the same stratification 
factors as the primary endpoint as covariates in the model.  
The ORR analysis was foreseen to be performed in the subset of subjects in the FAS who had measurable 
disease at baseline. A sensitivity analysis was planned to be produced in all subjects from FAS. 
Interim analysis and multiplicity 
There are 3 data cut-offs (DCO) for this study consisting of 2 interim analyses and 1 final analysis. This 
study would have met its primary objective if Arm A is statistically significantly superior to Arm B, either 
at IA-2 or at the final analysis. 
1.  Interim  Analysis-1  (IA-1):  The  objective  of  IA-1  is  to  assess  clinical  activity.  ORR  and  DoR  are 
summarized  to  support  early  registration  of  durvalumab  when  administered  in  combination  with 
gemcitabine/cisplatin.  The  summaries  are  done  both  for  Investigator  assessments  and  for  blinded 
independent central review (BICR) assessments according to RECIST 1.1. The BICR summaries are of 
primary  interest  with  the  Investigator  data  providing  supportive  evidence.  The  planned  DCO  for  IA-1 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 60/142 
 
 
 
was foreseen to occur when at least 200 subjects have completed at least 32 weeks of follow-up or the 
last subject has been randomized to the global cohort whichever comes later. The analysis set includes 
all randomized subjects who have had the opportunity for at least 32 weeks of follow-up at the time of 
the  
IA-1 DCO (FAS-32w, i.e. randomized ≥32 weeks prior to IA-1 DCO). At IA-1, no formal statistical testing 
was planned to be performed, however an exploratory p-value from a stratified CMH test for ORR was 
produced following FDA feedback. The primary endpoint for IA-1 is the confirmed ORR based on BICR 
as per RECIST 1.1. 
2.  Interim  Analysis  -2  (IA-2):  IA-2  tested  for  early  superiority  of  the  durvalumab  regimen  relative  to 
control.  This  analysis  was  planned  to  be  performed  when  approximately  397  OS  events  have  been 
observed in the study (59% maturity or 80% information fraction).   
3. Final Analysis (FA): The FA was planned to be performed when approximately 496 OS events have 
been observed in the study (74% maturity).   
A small alpha expenditure of 0.001 (0.1%) was planned to be allocated to IA-1 for ORR. Strong control 
of  the  FWER  at  the  remaining  4.9%  level  (2-sided)  across  the  testing  of  OS  and  PFS  endpoints  was 
foreseen to be achieved through a combined approach of alpha allocation to the OS analyses (IA-2 and 
the FA) via O’Brien Fleming alpha spending function and a hierarchical testing procedure; that is, PFS 
was planned to be tested only if OS met statistical significance at IA-2 or FA (Glimm et al. 2010). 
Changes of analysis from protocol 
All PRO analyses are planned to be performed on PRO analysis set and not FAS as stated in CSP. No 
subgroup  analysis  are  foreseen  to  be  performed  for  DCR  as  considered  not  to  be  informative.  No 
sensitivity analysis were planned to be carried out for ORR and DoR for subjects with 32 weeks follow-
up as assessed by BICR, as BICR data were only to be collected up until IA-1. 
Changes to the SAP 
The amendment history was clearly presented in each version of the SAP. Main changes are listed below: 
•  Updates  to  the  sample  size  and  the  statistical  assumptions  and  the  information  fraction, 
maturity, and OS events required for IA-2 and FA (CSP Version 4, 17 April 2020). 
o  This was based solely on non-TOPAZ-1 data and input from the steering committee and 
investigators  who  considered  that  HR  of  approximately  0.75  was  also  clinically 
meaningful and an appropriate target. 
•  Subsequent update of information fraction to 80% for IA-2 (CSP Version 6, 28 October 2020). 
o  The information fraction was increased to have an adequate follow-up time and number 
of  events  to  test  for  superiority,  with  consideration  to  a  possible  delayed  OS  curve 
separation  that  is  commonly  seen  with  studies  of  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  + 
chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone. 
Primary endpoint: Changed testing method for OS at FA from stratified log-rank to FH(0, 1); updated 
text about the Cox sensitivity model; added stratified log-rank test as a sensitivity model for p-value at 
FA; included rational for using FH(0, 1) test instead of a log-rank test at FA (at TOPAZ-1 CSP Version 7, 
01 March 2021). 
It is also noted that progressive changes and clarifications with respect to the statistical analyses, sample 
size  and  assumptions  regarding  information  fractions  at  the  IA-2  and  FA  were  made  (TOPAZ-1  CSP 
Versions 3, 18 September 2019; Version 4, 17 Apr 2020; Version 6, 28 Oct 2020, and Version 7, 01 
Assessment report

Page 61/142 
 
 
 
March  2021).  However,  as  these  were  made  prior  to  unblinding  these  changes  are  not  considered 
impactful on study integrity. 
Results 
The submission is based on the results from the second interim analysis (IA-2; DCO of 11 August 2021) 
of TOPAZ-1. The objective of IA-2 was to assess the superiority of OS for D + Gem/Cis versus placebo 
+ Gem/Cis in patients previously untreated for unresectable  locally advanced or metastatic BTC (and 
was conducted when 424 of the 496 expected OS events had occurred [61.9% overall maturity for OS]). 
Data from an exploratory analysis on OS (DCO 25 February 2022), when the expected event maturity 
would be in the range of the original protocol specified final analysis, was provided (results from this 
analysis are included in the Outcomes section).

214 (23.4%) patients failed screening. The most common reason for screen failure was adequate organ 
and  marrow  function  (defined  using  limits  that  are  routinely  used  in  oncology  studies,  see  inclusion 
criterion 11) (N=71 patients), followed by judgement by investigators that the patient was unlikely to 
comply  with  study  procedures,  restrictions,  and  requirements  (see  exclusion  criterion  24)  (N=23

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 16 April 2019 and the last patient on 11 December 2020. 
Patients  were  randomized  from  17  countries:  Asia  (374  patients:  South  Korea  [120],  Thailand  [83], 
Japan [78], Taiwan [60], India [24], China [5; global cohort only], and Hong Kong [4]), Europe (215 
patients:  France  [47],  UK  [47],  Poland  [34],  Italy  [31],  Russian  Federation  [25],  Turkey  [18],  and 
Bulgaria [13]), North America (65 patients: all sites within the US), and South America (31 patients: 
Argentina [22] and Chile [9]). 
Conduct of the study 
At the time of data cutoff, the protocol for study TOPAZ-1 had 5 major amendments, although 7 versions 
exist because V5 was not implemented due to text formatting errors.

The analysis was performed using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron), adjusting for disease 
status and primary tumor location. The CI being calculated using a profile likelihood approach. A hazard ratio < 1 
favors durvalumab, to be associated with a longer overall survival than placebo. 
The analysis was performed using a stratified log-rank test and tested at 0.03 significance level. 
Includes patients known to be alive at data cut-off.  
Includes patients with unknown survival status or patients who were lost to follow-up or patients with 'other' 
recorded on case report form. 
however, details of death could be obtained using publicly available registration, where local law permitted. 
 Overall, 13 patients withdrew consent for study participation prior to death; 
Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique. CI for median overall survival derived based on Brookmeyer-Crowley 
method.

Fluke-related BTC: Trematode infections are endemic in Asia, particularly in several countries with high 
recruitment rates for the pivotal trial TOPAZ-1. On account of the established carcinogenic effect of these 
flatworms,  fluke-related  cholangiocarcinoma  is  considered  epidemiologically  and  pathophysiologically 
diverse  from  non-fluke-related  cholangiocarcinoma.  Although  it  seems  clear  that  fluke-related 
cholangiocarcinoma  has  a  different  and  more  complex  mutational  burden  (Jusakul  et  al,  2017),  data 
about its different prognosis is limited and how this may influence the response to treatment is unknown.  
An exploratory subgroup analysis of OS was presented, in which patients recruited in countries deemed 
to be fluke-endemic (Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea) were grouped and compared to the rest 
of patients from TOPAZ-1. Acknowledging the caveats of subgroup analyses, the magnitude of survival 
benefit from add-on durvalumab to SoC gemcitabine + cisplatin seems larger in fluke-endemic countries 
(HR for OS 0.67) than in the rest (HR for OS 0.89). This pattern prevails in descriptive subgroup analyses 
of PFS.

Treatment beyond progression: 
According to the protocol, patients who were clinically stable at an initial RECIST 1.1-defined radiological 
progressive disease had the option to continue treatment beyond progression in case of clinical benefit 
at the investigator’s discretion. A total of 138 of 685 randomised patients (20.1%) received treatment 
beyond progression, 68 in the D + Gem/Cis arm and 70 in the Pbo + Gem/Cis treatment arm. Median 
duration of treatment beyond progression was 1.48 (range: 0.1 to 13.1) months for the D + Gem/Cis 
arm and 1.45 (range: 0.1 to 11.6) months for the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm. A median OS of 13.27 (95% CI: 
10.18 to 14.72) months was reported for the D + Gem/Cis arm and 12.85 (95% CI: 11.63 to 14.88) 
months  for  the  Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  treatment  arm.  The  median  time  from  progression  to  death  was  also 
similar between arms. Estimated HR for OS, PFS and OR for ORR were: HR for OS: 0.99 (95% CI: 0.64, 
1.50), HR for PFS: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.30) and OR for ORR: 1.07 (95% CI: 0.41, 2.81).  
Regarding the treatment course beyond progression, 100% of patients later discontinued chemotherapy, 
most  of  them  (around  60%)  due  to  maximum  cycle  of  chemotherapy  reached  (8  cycles)  and  some 
(almost 30%) due to condition under investigation worsened. The number of patients who discontinued 
durvalumab  was  54  (79.4%)  in  the  D  +  Gem/Cis  arm  and  the  number  of  patients  who  discontinued 
placebo in the Pbo + Gem/Cis was 67 (95.7%).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The claimed indication in this application is for durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy for the 
treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic BTC, including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma 
(IHCC),  extrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma  (EHCC)  and  gallbladder  carcinoma  (GC).  The  application  is 
based on results from the second interim analysis (IA-2, DCO 11-AUG-2021) of a single phase III trial: 
TOPAZ-1 was carried out double-blind and randomised subjects to durvalumab + gemcitabine/cisplatin 
(D + Gem/Cis, n=341) or placebo + gemcitabine/cisplatin (Pbo + Gem/Cis, n=344). Updated OS results 
(DCO 25-FEB-2022) were annexed as supportive data. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study design of TOPAZ-1 is adequate to prove superiority of the combination of durvalumab + SoC 
chemotherapy  vs.  SoC.  The  critical  design  elements  of  TOPAZ-1  were  discussed  in  a  scientific  advice 
(SA)  procedure  (EMEA/H/SA/2752/14/2018/II)  on  31  January  2019,  months  before  initiating 
recruitment.  There  was  general  agreement  with  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  treatments  in  the 
experimental/control  arms  and  endpoints.  However,  it  was  pointed  out  that  considering  such 
heterogeneous  population,  assessment  of  B/R  would  likely  require  that  the  clinical  relevance  of  an 
observed benefit applied to all important subgroups. Of note, at the time of SA and initial versions of the 
protocol, the planned sample size was 474 patients. Study design has been overall maintained since the 
first protocol version, but sample size was increased during the conduct of the study. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to each treatment arm. A block randomization strategy was implemented, 
which is agreed. 
Study participants: Patients with acceptable serum bilirubin levels (≤2 ULN) were allowed in the trial: 
any  significant  biliary  obstruction  must  have  been  resolved  before  randomisation.  Regarding  disease 
status, de novo advanced BTC or recurrence after initial surgery +/- adjuvant treatment were permitted 
(this  was  a  stratification  factor),  as  was  inactive  hepatitis  B.  Patients  with  brain  metastases  were 
excluded.  Overall,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  appropriately  reflect  the  population  intended  for 
treatment according to the sought therapeutic indication.  
Patients with unresectable disease were included. The criteria for resectability vary across the different 
types  of  BTC  (e.g.  Bismuth-Corlette  classification  for  perihilar  cholangiocarcinomas)  and  thus 
unresectable  biliary  tumours  cannot  be  simplified  as  “locally  advanced”.  To  appropriately  reflect  the 
recruited population, “locally advanced” was substituted by “unresectable” in the therapeutic indication 
statement at section 4.1 of the SmPC. It was also agreed to specify that the intended setting for the new 
indication is in first-line approach. 
Treatments: The combination of gemcitabine + cisplatin is one of the regimens considered as standard-
of-care for advanced BTC, particularly for patients with good performance status and normal bilirubin 
levels. The doses and scheme of this backbone regimen in both arms of TOPAZ-1 are appropriate. The 
maximum number of chemotherapy cycles allowed per protocol (8) is presented in section 4.2 of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 90/142 
 
 
 
 
SmPC. Since gemcitabine + oxaliplatin (GEMOX) is also an appropriate choice for the frontline approach 
to advanced BTC –albeit not allowed in this pivotal trial–, it was deemed appropriate that the specific 
chemotherapy regimen used in the trial was specified in the therapeutic indication in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC. 
Most of the patients from the trial received subsequent cytotoxic chemotherapy (40% and 45%, 
respectively) which was expected, as the most extended 2L treatment is mFOLFOX, based on results 
from study ABC-06. FOLFIRI could be an alternative in this setting, considering this is a platinum-free 
regimen and patients had already received cisplatin in 1L. 
Available data from patients treated with durvalumab beyond progression, as allowed by protocol, do 
not support a general recommendation regarding duration of treatment. 
Endpoints:  Overall  survival  as  primary  endpoint  of  a  trial  that  evaluates  first  line  approach  in  an 
aggressive disease such as BTC is supported. Since TOPAZ-1 is double-blind and the primary endpoint 
is OS, the fact that secondary endpoints of PFS, ORR and DOR are assessed by investigator is acceptable. 
The definitions of the primary and secondary endpoints are endorsed. Of note, the assessment of ORR 
and DOR for IA1 was based on BICR evaluation. 
Statistical methods: The only secondary endpoint controlled for multiplicity is PFS. The MAH implemented 
a hierarchical approach in which PFS is only tested if the null hypothesis for OS is rejected. Furthermore, 
the study had 2 interim analysis and one final analysis. 
Alpha  expenditure  of  0.001  was  allocated  to  IA-1  for  BICR-ORR  (in  a  dataset  with  subjects  that  had 
enough  follow-up  to  assess  response)  to  investigate  clinical  activity,  and  the  results  were  not 
communicated to investigators. Although IA-1 is not opposed, it is perplexing to envisage that a phase 
III trial would be initiated with uncertainties regarding potential effect. At IA-2, only OS and PFS were 
included in the hierarchical testing, and the O’Brien Fleming alpha spending function was implemented 
to the remaining 0.049 alpha to control type I error due to multiple looks.  
The sample size of the study was increased while the study was ongoing. The original sample size was 
474 patients targeting a HR of 0.7 and requiring 341 OS events (Protocol V1, 19 December 2018). In 
protocol V4 (17 April 2020), the sample size was increased  to 672 patients, targeting a  higher HR of 
0.75.  It  was  then  assumed  that  496  OS  events  at  final  analysis  would  be  sufficient  to  show  an 
approximately 4-month improvement in median OS with 90% statistical power. Moreover, the number 
of OS events required for IA-2 was increased from 347 to 397 (i.e., information fraction from 70% to 
80%)  in  protocol  V6  dated  28  October  2020.  The  changes  were  made  prior  unblinding  the  data  and 
apparently based in external data (Ikeda et al, 2019, Chen et al, 2019) and agreement from the steering 
committee. Even when the impact of those changes in the study conduct cannot be fully ruled out since 
an increase in sample size or increase of the targeted HR may signal to investigators and participants 
that the treatment effect is actually lower than expected, it seems unlikely that the amendments made 
during the conduct of the TOPAZ-1 study would affect the reported efficacy results.  
The statistical methods implemented to analyse OS, PFS and ORR are overall endorsed. 
Participant flow and recruitment: A total of 914 patients were screened for eligibility. The screen failure 
rate (25%) is slightly high, but understood upon stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. The ITT population 
was constituted by 685 patients: 341 patients in the D + Gem/Cis arm and 344 in the Pbo + Gem/Cis 
arm. The patient disposition table can be followed, and data seem as expected for a trial in advanced 
BTC. In the context of blinding, withdrawals from treatment due to patient decision are balanced. It is 
reassuring that withdrawals of treatment due to AEs are also balanced (~5%) in both arms. 
At the time of IA2, 63 (18.6%) patients from the D + Gem/Cis arm and 20 (5.8%) patients from the 
Pbo + Gem/Cis arm were still on treatment.

It  was  clarified  that  the  category  “subjective  disease  progression”  in  fact  corresponds  to  clinical 
progression  without  radiological  evidence  of  PD,  and  that  these  decisions,  although  made  by 
investigators, were subject to necessary queries (e.g., checks to ensure that there was no evidence of 
radiographic disease progression). 
More patients in the D + Gem/Cis arm than in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm discontinued treatment because 
of death: 6 vs. 2 discontinued durvalumab/placebo. 
There were no patients lost to follow-up. 
Conduct of the study: Major protocol violations were rare, although more prevalent in the experimental 
arm: the difference seems attributable to 8 patients who were randomised to D + Gem/Cis, but received 
a  single  first  dose  of  placebo  by  error.  As  pointed  out  in  the  statistics  section,  the  main  criticism  to 
conduct of the trial concerns amendments of sample size, efficacy assumptions and information fraction 
necessary for IA-2 while the trial was ongoing.  
Baseline data: Heterogeneity of the enrolled population is one of the main limitations of this study. The 
considerable predominance of Asian patients (56%) in the trial relates a corresponding percentage of 
patients recruited in Asia. The representation of European patients in the trial is considered appropriate. 
Other  demographic  characteristics  (age  distribution,  BMI)  were  well  balanced  between  arms.  As 
expected, the distribution of stratification factors is well-balanced between both arms, and the reverse 
distribution of IHCC and EHCC in the trial, as compared to global trends, can be explained by the fact 
that EHCC, although more prevalent, is more likely to be treated in earlier stages due to symptomatic 
cholestasis, which in turn decreases the pool of patients with advanced EHCC. The extent of metastatic 
disease  is  also  balanced  between  arms  and  corresponds  to  the  typical  pattern  of  distribution  in  BTC: 
main  organs  affected  were  liver,  distant  lymph  nodes,  peritoneum  and  lungs.  Regarding  PD-L1 
expression categories (as determined by the SP263 assay and tumour/immune cell positivity algorithm), 
11% of patients are uncategorised (missing data) and about a third had PD-L1 negative status (<1%), 
and although the rest are considered as positive, only 16% of the ITT had PD-L1 ≥10%.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Primary endpoint, OS: At data cutoff corresponding to IA-2 (11 August 2021) and with a median follow-
up of 9.8 months, 424 deaths had occurred (62% of overall OS maturity) in the ITT. Of note, IA-2 was 
planned  to  occur  at  ~397  of  496  OS  events.  The  study  met  its  primary  endpoint  and  IA-2  is  now 
considered the final analysis: the stratified HR for OS shows statistical superiority of D + Gem/Cis vs. 
Pbo + Gem/Cis: 0.80 (97% CI 0.64, 0.99), p-value 0.021. K-M estimates of median OS are 12.8 months 
and 11.5 months in Pbo + Gem/Cis, respectively, for an approximate median survival gain of 1.3 months. 
The  K-M  curves  initially  overlap,  but  separate  at  month  5,  with  the  experimental  D  +  Gem/Cis  arm 
remaining on top. Considerable censoring occurs as of month 8. An exploratory OS analysis performed 
at data cutoff 25 February 2022 and 12 months of median follow-up, when 517 OS events had occurred 
(77% of overall OS maturity), provided similar data: median OS remains nearly unchanged (12.9 months 
in the experimental arm vs. 11.3 months in the control arm) and nominal HR of 0.76. The behaviour of 
the K-M curves is similar, but most of the censoring occurs as of month 14. The overall maturity at this 
follow-up DCO is similar to that pre-specified for the final analysis in the protocol, i.e., 74%. Performance 
of the control arm (Pbo + Gem/Cis) is comparable to the pivotal trial that established Gem/Cis as SoC 
for advanced biliary tract cancer: median OS 11.7 months (ABC-02, Valle et al, NEJM 2010). 
Albeit durvalumab adds a marginal survival benefit to SoC gemcitabine + cisplatin (median OS gain ~1.5 
months), it is reassuring that updated data –OS maturity approaching 80%– follow the initial trend for 
survival benefit.

Overall  performance  of  the  control  arm  (Pbo  +  Gem/Cis)  is  comparable  to  the  pivotal  trial  that 
established Gem/Cis as SoC for advanced biliary tract cancer: median OS 11.7 months (ABC-02, Valle 
et al, NEJM 2010). 
Secondary  endpoint,  INV-assessed  PFS:  At  IA-2,  573  investigator-assessed  PFS  events  had  occurred 
(84% of overall PFS maturity) in the ITT population. Overall PFS data support survival results, showing 
an advantage for the D + Gem/Cis arm (median PFS 7.2 months) over SoC Gem/Cis (median PFS 5.7 
months),  with  a  HR  for  PFS  of  0.75  (95.19%  CI  0.63,  0.89),  and  p-value  of  0.001.  The  K-M  curves 
separate as of month 4, with landmark analysis at 6, 9 and 12 months supporting the PFS benefit from 
added durvalumab. 
Secondary endpoint, INV-assessed ORR/DOR: At IA-2, confirmed ORR was 27% for the D + Gem/Cis 
arm and 19% for the control arm. Only one patient without measurable disease at baseline (from the 
Pbo + Gem/Cis) arm was excluded from the denominator of this calculation, which –in context of the 
ITT– is not deemed to substantially impact the quotient. About 72% of responders across both arms had 
presented PD or died at the time of IA-2. With this information fraction in mind, albeit median DOR did 
not  differ  between  the  D  +  Gem/Cis  (6.4  months)  and  Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  (6.2  months)  arms,  the  K-M 
curves suggest a slight advantage (sustained response beyond 9 months) in a minority of patients from 
the experimental arm. 
Secondary endpoint –PROs: Compliance rates for PROs were good and around 80% through cycle 20, 
although  following  OS/PFS  trends,  expected  forms  had  been  reduced  drastically  by  the  time  patients 
reached cycle 12: 152 expected EORTC QLQ-C30 forms at cycle 12 vs. 643 at baseline. 
Median time to deterioration (TTD) for global health status per EORTC QLQ-C30 was 7.4 months in the 
D + Gem/Cis arm and 6.7 months in the control arm. Although none of the comparisons in the rest of 
categories of TTD from QLQ-C30 were protected for multiplicity, the exploratory HR does not point out 
a significant advantage from the experimental arm over the control arm, whereas appetite loss seems 
less pronounced in the control arm. 
Median TTD across categories of EORTC QLQ-BIL21 (an instrument designed for patients with BTC) is 
also suggestive of similar performance in both arms of the trial. 
Sensitivity  analyses  of  OS  (attrition  bias  and  effect  of  covariates)  and  PFS  (attrition  bias,  evaluation-
time bias and effect of covariates) were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses: The beneficial OS and PFS effect from added durvalumab to Gem/Cis is maintained 
across  the  predefined  subgroups,  noting  all  nominal  hazard  ratios  under  1.  Of  note,  results  from  the 
updated forest plot on OS (DCO 25-FEB-2022) were consistent with those from the primary analysis. 
More fluctuation is seen in the forest plot that depicts ORR (compared via the CMH test) by subgroups. 
It is to note the minimum difference in ORR in the PD-L1 negative subgroup: 20% in D + Gem/Cis vs 
18% in Pbo + Gem/Cis. 
Treatment effect of added durvalumab is less pronounced in gallbladder cancer (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.65, 
1.37)  though  not  indicative  of  a  clear detrimental  effect.  With  the  6.5  months  update,  this  difference 
between GBC and cholangiocarcinoma subgroups analyses is maintained, with an estimated HR for GBC 
of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.24).  
Considering that results come from a subgroup not powered to infer firm conclusions and that there is 
not enough evidence that suggest that GBC could be considered a different entity, it is considered that 
the positive B/R of the combination applies regardless of primary tumour location.  
Noting  a  trend  for  increased  treatment  effect  in  Asian  populations  and  considering  the  prevalence  of 
carcinogenic  trematodes  in  certain  Asian  countries,  an  exploratory  subgroup  analysis  of  OS  in  which 
Assessment report

Page 93/142 
 
 
 
patients recruited in countries deemed to be fluke-endemic (Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea) 
were grouped and compared to the rest of patients from TOPAZ-1 was presented. Acknowledging the 
caveats  of  subgroup  analyses,  the  magnitude  of  survival  benefit  from  add-on  durvalumab  to  SoC 
gemcitabine + cisplatin seems larger in fluke-endemic countries (HR for OS 0.67) than in the rest (HR 
for OS 0.89). This pattern prevails in descriptive subgroup analyses of PFS. Since there were no patients 
who had a registered medical history of fluke infection in the trial, the potential added benefit of add-on 
anti  PD-L1  treatment  in  fluke-related  cholangiocarcinoma  remains  a  hypothesis.  Other  factors  could 
explain the reported difference in efficacy observed between Asia and other regions.  
Efficacy by PD-L1 subgroups: PD-L1 status was available for 89% of participants in the trial. Although a 
consistent advantage of the combination for high PD-L1 expressors is perceived, irrespective of the cut-
off, some KM curves of OS and PFS cross multiple times and overlap, so a clear pattern of separation of 
the  curves  is  not  observed.  Although  there  is  biological  plausibility  for  a  higher  benefit  following  the 
addition  of  durvalumab  for  patients  with  high  PD-L1  expression,  based  on  the  results  from  TOPAZ-1 
study it is difficult to set any cut-off for which this difference in efficacy seems relevant, even more when 
PD-L1  expression  was  not  a  stratification  factor.  A  post  hoc  interaction  test  of  durvalumab  by  PD-L1 
status was performed for OS using TAP thresholds of 1% and 5%: neither of the two interactions was 
significant at the nominal 5% significance level. 
The  available  evidence  for  the  prognostic  and  predictive  impact  of  PD-L1  tumour  expression  in  BTC 
treated with chemotherapy and the prevalence of high PD-L1 tumours in this setting was reviewed, from 
literature. Results from a meta-analysis including 18 studies (Xie et al 2020) showed that overexpression 
of PD-L1 was significantly correlated with worse OS in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Another meta-
analysis which included 10 studies (Xu et al 2019) showed a trend that high PD-L1 expression indicated 
a  poor  OS  but  the  result  was  not  statistically  significant.  Both  meta-analysis  included  studies  with 
different PD-L1 expression cut-offs and detection methods.  
The mentioned phase 2 study of durvalumab in combination with Gem/Cis (Oh et al 2020) included 118 
PD-L1 evaluable patients. From them, 36 (31%) had positive PD-L1 (≥1% tumour cells). In biomarker 
exploratory analyses, PD-L1 expression did not appear to be associated with clinical outcomes of ORR. 
A phase 1 study of nivolumab monotherapy (2L) or in combination (1L) with Gem/Cis (Ueno et al 2019) 
in BTC included too few PD-L1 positive patients (both tumour cells and tumour-related cells) to draw any 
conclusions. Keynote 158 study was a multicohort study (Marabelle et al 2020) in which pembrolizumab 
was administered to patients with non-colorrectal MSI-H tumours and that included one cohort (B) of 
biliary adenocarcinoma. Its results, combined with those from the phase 1 basket study Keynote 028 
(Piha-Paul et al, 2020) that rendered a total of 85 PD-L1 positive patients (1% tumour-associated cells 
cut-off),  showed  no  clear  trend  when  comparing  ORR  of  subjects  with  positive  and  negative  PD-L1 
expressing tumours. 
With  the  data  provided,  it  remains  uncertain  whether  the  beneficial  effect  on  survival  -and  other 
endpoints- from added durvalumab to SoC Gem/Cis is maintained regardless of PD-L1 expression across 
diverse categories (≥ and < 1%, 5%, 10%). However, there does not seem to be enough evidence to 
establish PD-L1 expression as a predictive factor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment 
in advanced BTC. Moreover, the exploratory results from TOPAZ-1 are not considered enough to define 
a  PD-L1  expression  population  which  would  clearly  benefit  more  from  the  addition  of  durvalumab  to 
Gem/Cis chemotherapy for the treatment of BTC.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  statistical  outcome  of  TOPAZ-1  is  positive  and  highlights  a  survival  benefit  on  the  addition  of 
durvalumab to SoC gemcitabine + cisplatin (median OS gain ~1.5 months) for patients with advanced 
Assessment report

biliary tract cancer. Although modest, the advantage is maintained in updated efficacy data (OS maturity 
approach 80%) and supported by results from secondary endpoints (investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, 
DOR).  Sensitivity  and  subgroup  analyses  were  consistent  with  the  main  analysis,  suggesting  that  the 
benefits are observed across the predefined subgroups. There does not seem to be enough evidence to 
establish PD-L1 expression as a predictive factor to added immune checkpoint inhibition in this particular 
clinical setting. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Durvalumab is a marketed product, with approvals in most regions for unresectable stage III NSCLC, 
and ES-SCLC and in fewer markets for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (UC). 
The  pivotal  safety  dataset  that  provides  evidence  supporting  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  in  the 
proposed  indication  is  based  on  the  pre-planned  interim  analysis  (IA-2;  DCO  11  August  2021)  of  the 
ongoing Phase III study TOPAZ-1 in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BTC. 
The pivotal safety dataset (patients who did receive the assigned treatment) comprises 338 patients in 
the D + Gem/Cis arm and 342 patients in the placebo + Gem/Cis arm. In the D + Gem/Cis arm, the 
regimen of durvalumab is similar to the approved regimen for ES-SCLC, although chemotherapy is to be 
kept for 8 cycles (not 4 as in ES-SCLC): 1500 mg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 
8 cycles, followed by 1500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy. 
The pivotal safety data set (from TOPAZ-1) is presented alongside the integrated pooled dataset: D pan-
tumour pool (N=3006) comprising patients from 9 clinical studies who have received at least 1 dose of 
durvalumab monotherapy given at a dose of either 10 mg/kg Q2W IV or 20 mg/kg Q4W IV for any line 
of therapy and across tumour types (Table 34). 
The pivotal data set is not pooled in the D pan-tumour pool because of the chemotherapy component of 
the treatment regimens.  
All  studies  in  the  D  pan-tumour  pool  used  body  weight-based  monotherapy  regimens  of  durvalumab, 
whereas flat dosing (1500 mg Q3W or Q4W) plus chemotherapy was used in the CASPIAN study (ES-
SCLC), the POSEIDON study (NSCLC) and now in the TOPAZ-1 trial (BTC).

Table 37. Number of Treatment Cycles Received (Durvalumab or Placebo, Gemcitabine, and 
Cisplatin) (Safety Analysis Set) 
Of the 685 patients enrolled in the pivotal study, five did not receive treatment. 140 patients were still 
on-study at IA-2 in the D+Gem/Cis arm and 111 in the placebo + Gem/Cis arm. Patients still ongoing 
with  study  treatment  were  18.6%  and  5.8%,  respectively,  and  off  treatment  22.6%  and  26.5%, 
respectively.  
The median total treatment duration of exposure in the chemotherapy period of durvalumab and placebo 
exposure in TOPAZ-1 was 5.60 months in the D+Gem/Cis arm compared to 5.52 months in the placebo 
+ Gem/Cis arm. In the monotherapy period it was 3.22 months and 2.76 months, respectively (Table 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 99/142 
 
 
 
 
 
35). Overall, the median duration of exposure was longer with D+Gem/Cis (7.33 months) compared to 
placebo + Gem/Cis (5.77 months). This difference is attributable to a longer duration of monotherapy 
therapy for the D+Gem/Cis group. 
In the chemotherapy period, the median duration of Gem and Cis were comparable in the two treatment 
arms.  The  patients  were  able  to  tolerate  up  to  8  cycles  of  Gem/Cis  when  given  in  combination  with 
durvalumab.  
The median number of durvalumab cycles was 10 (range: 1 to 29), with 30.8% patients receiving ≥ 12 
cycles. The median number of placebo cycles was 8 (1 to 26), with 19.6% patients receiving ≥ 12 cycles. 
Overall,  patients  were  able  to  tolerate  up  to  8  cycles  of  Gem/Cis  when  given  in  combination  with 
durvalumab.  Comparing  the  D  +  Gem/Cis  and  the  placebo  +  Gem/Cis  treatment  groups,  60.1%  and 
52.0%  patients  received  all  8  cycles  of  gemcitabine  (by  respective  treatment  group)  and  59.2%  and 
50.0% patients received all 8 cycles of cisplatin (by respective treatment group) (Table 37).

Nearly all patients in the Durvalumab arm (99.4%) and in the placebo arm (98.8) from pivotal TOPAZ-
1 study experienced any Grade AEs. High-grade (≥G3) AEs were seen in 75.7% and 77.8%, respectively 
compared to 42.9% in the D pan-tumour pool. SAEs (including events with outcome of death) were seen 
in 47.3% and 43.6%, respectively, compared to 35.5% in the D pan-tumour pool.  
The percentage of AEs that were possibly related to any study treatment was high and similar between 
arms: 93% in the durvalumab arm vs. 90% in the placebo arm. The percentage of high-grade (≥G3) 
AEs which were considered as possibly related to durvalumab (10.9%) was similar to the percentage of 
the AEs which were considered as possibly related to durvalumab in the D pan-tumour pool (11.0%).

Incidence of the most common AEs (≥10%) in the durvalumab arm was overall comparable to that in 
the  placebo  arm:  anaemia  (48.2%  vs  44.7%),  nausea  (40.2%  vs  34.2%),  constipation  (32.0%  vs 
28.9%), neutropenia (31.7% vs 29.8%), fatigue (26.9% vs 26.3%), neutrophil count decrease (26.9% 
vs 31.0%), decreased appetite (25.7% vs 23.1%) and platelet count decreased (20.7% vs 23.1%).  
The most commonly reported AEs possibly related to any treatment were anaemia (39.6% vs. 36.0%), 
nausea (34.3% vs. 28.7%), neutropenia (29.3% vs. 28.7%), neutrophil count decreased (26.3% 30.4%)

The incidence of AEs of grade 3 or 4 (frequency ≥2%) in the durvalumab arm was overall similar to 
that seen in placebo arm, noting anaemia (23.7% vs 22.5%), neutrophil count decrease (21.0% vs 
25.7%), neutropenia (20.1% vs 21.1%), platelet count decrease (9.8% vs 8.5%), and 
thrombocytopenia (4.7% vs 5.3%). Of note, the incidence of cholangitis (a relatively common infection 
in patients with biliary tract tumours, often in relationship to instrumentation and invasive biliary tract 
procedures) is doubled in the durvalumab arm (6.5%) in comparation to the placebo arm (3.2%).

There were 4 patients who reported a SAE of “ischaemic stroke” in the durvalumab arm vs. 1 patient in 
the placebo arm. Of note, in 2 patients from the durvalumab arm this SAE was fatal, and in 2 patients 
this SAE was considered as possibly related (1 of them fatal). The fatal SAEs are further discussed in the 
“Deaths” section. The other SAEs of ischemic stroke were as follows:  
•  Subject  E2306006  had  the  SAE  of  “ischaemic  stroke”  on  Study  Day  155,  and  the  last  dose  of 
durvalumab  prior  to  the  SAE  was  on  Study  Day  141.  According  to  the  narrative  submitted  by  the 
MAH,  this  subject  did  not  have  a  relevant  medical  history.  The  SAE  was  considered  as 
recovered/resolved  with  sequelae  on  Study  Day  158.  The  investigator  considered  the  SAE  of 
ischaemic stroke as possibly related to durvalumab and unlikely related to gemcitabine/cisplatin. The 
reasons  why  the  investigator  considered  durvalumab  as  possibly  related  to  the  occurrence  of  this 
SAE, and unlikely related to the chemotherapy are unclear. 
•  Subject  E2809001  had  the  SAE  of  “ischaemic  stroke”  on  Study  Day  90.  The  last  doses  of 
durvalumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin prior to the SAE were on Study Day 85. The event was reported 
as  not  recovered/not  resolved  when  the  patient  died  on  Study  Day  198  primarily  due  to 
cholangiocarcinoma.  The 
investigator  considered 
the  SAE 
to  be  unlikely 
related 
to 
durvalumab/gemcitabine/cisplatin, although in the narrative it was also highlighted that the patient 
did not have risk factors and that that was the patient’s first episode of stroke.    
There were 8 (2.4%) SAEs of “acute kidney injury” in the durvalumab arm vs. 4 (1.2%) in the placebo 
arm. According to Table 46, 5 of the 8 SAEs were considered as causally related to any study treatment. 
However, in the narratives only 4 SAEs were considered as so. Of note, all those 4 SAEs were considered 
causally related to cisplatin, and no SAE was considered causally related to durvalumab. Additionally, in 
the D pan-tumour pool the incidence of this SAE was 0.7%.       
Assessment report

SAEs occurred in nearly half of the ITT, slightly more often in the durvalumab arm (47%) in comparison 
to the placebo arm (44%). The most common SAEs (frequency ≥1%) were cholangitis (7.4% vs 5.0%), 
pyrexia (3.8% vs 2.3%), anaemia (3.6% vs 1.2%), sepsis (3.3% vs 2.6%), acute kidney injury (2.4% 
vs 1.2%) and biliary obstruction (1.8% vs 2.0%), respectively.  
Biliary stenting and drainage procedures during treatment were not more frequent in the durvalumab 
arm (17%) than in the placebo arm (18%). 
Similarly, SAEs causally-related to any study treatment occurred in a similar proportion in both arms: 
15.7% vs. 17.3%, respectively. Comparing with the percentages reported in the D pan-tumor pool, the 
percentages observed in both arms of TOPAZ-1 Study were higher than the percentage reported in the 
D  pan-tumor  pool  (35.5%),  probably  reflecting  the  poor  prognosis  of  patients  in  TOPAZ-1  and  the 
administration of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy instead of durvalumab as monotherapy. 
The percentage of SAEs possibly related to durvalumab was similar in the TOPAZ-1 Study and in the D 
pan-tumor pool: 5.9% in the TOPAZ-1 Study vs. 6.6% in the D pan-tumour pool (Table 38).    
The three most frequently reported SAEs were cholangitis (7.4% vs. 5.0%), pyrexia (3.8% vs. 2.3%) 
and anaemia (3.6% vs. 1.2%). The three most frequently reported causally-related (to any treatment) 
SAEs were anaemia (2.7% vs. 1.2%), acute kidney injury (1.5% vs. 0.6%) and fatigue (1.5% vs. 
0.6%). Of note, in the D pan tumour-pool the incidence of cholangitis was less than 0.1% (3 patients).

Narratives of patients who died from cerebrovascular events (“ischemic stroke”) in the D + Cis/Gem 
arm: 
•  Patient E1304003 death (“cerebral infarction”) was considered by the investigator as unlikely related 
to any of the treatments administered as part of the clinical trial, although no particular explanation 
is given for this assumption. Of note, in the narrative of this event it is stated that based on available 
medical records, and to the best of the MAH’s knowledge, no medical history related to this event 
was found. Death occurred on day 77 after the first and only dose of durvalumab since, as per the 
subject’s decision after this dose, durvalumab was permanently discontinued.  
•  Patient  E2303002  death  (“cerebral  haemorrhage”)  was  considered  by  the  investigator  as  unlikely 
related to any of the treatments administered as part of the clinical trial. Patient died on Study Day 
120, and the last dose of durvalumab was on Study Day 43. Of note, the subject was diagnosed with 
brain metastasis on Study Day 64, and at the time of death she had also been diagnosed with COVID-
19. The subject also had hypertension.   
•  Patient E2307008 death (“ischaemic stroke”) was considered by the investigator as possibly related 
to  durvalumab.  Of  note,  the  patient  suffered  an  ischaemic  stroke  within  15  minutes  of  the  first 
durvalumab  infusion,  and  died  4  days  after  that.  The  patient’s  relevant  medical  history  included 
pulmonary  embolism,  which  ended  around  10  days  before  the  administration  of  durvalumab.  The 
patient also had controlled hypertension.  
•  Patient E7501021 death (“ischaemic stroke”) was considered by the investigator as unlikely related 
to any of the treatments administered as part of the clinical trial. On Study Day 72, while the patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 113/142 
 
 
 
 
was  receiving  pre-medication  he  had  an  ischaemic  stroke.  At  that  moment  the  patient  was  also 
recovering from a pulmonary embolism. The last dose of durvalumab prior to the ischaemic stroke 
was on Study Day 65.   
At IA-2, 424 deaths had occurred, 198 in the durvalumab arm (58% of n=341) and 226 in the placebo 
arm  (66%  of  n=344).  According  to  the  investigator,  most  of  these  deaths  were  attributable  to  the 
underlying cancer. Regarding AEs with outcome of death, some deaths were according to the investigator 
solely attributable to AEs (4 in each arm) and some other deaths to AEs and the underlying cancer (8 in 
the  durvalumab  arm  and  10  in  placebo).  All  in  all,  AEs  with  outcome  of  death  were  observed  in  12 
patients from the durvalumab arm and 14 in the placebo arm. 
Regarding  causality,  infections  were  the  main  associated  AE  to  death  in  these  26  patients  (4  in 
durvalumab, 5 in placebo). Death from biliary sepsis occurred in one patient from the durvalumab arm. 
Importantly, 4 patients in the durvalumab arm and none in the placebo arm died from nervous system 
AEs, ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes in all cases. None of these conditions were seen in the Placebo 
+ Gem/Cis arm, nor in the D pan-tumour pool. Three of the four patients had pre-existing and/or ongoing 
risk  factors  (in  addition  to  malignancy)  and  the  4th  event  occurred  76  days  after  the  single  dose  of 
durvalumab. The latter event was seen in a patient where cancer was the only identifiable risk factor 
and the case lacks details on clinical course, diagnostics, and circumstances leading to death; thus, it is 
not possible to allow for a conclusive assessment of the event and its causal relationship to study therapy. 
Abbreviated narratives for the four cases were provided, together with literature references on cancer 
and the resulting high risk of stroke.  
One  of  the  reported  AEs  leading  to  death  (subject  E7603003)  was  considered  a  “sudden  death”,  and 
although the cause of death was not fully known, the investigator considered it as unlikely related to 
treatment with any treatment administered in the clinical trial. Initially, it was considered possibly related 
to embolus. The last dose of durvalumab prior to the sudden death was on Study Day 101, and death 
occurred on Study Day 126. 
Another AE leading to death which was considered as causally related to durvalumab and 
gemcitabine/cisplatin was “hepatic failure” (subject E5702008). This patient died on Study Day 30, 
after having received only 1 dose of durvalumab (Study Day 1) and having suffered also a SAE of 
cholangitis. In the narrative it is stated that the investigator considered the SAE of hepatic failure as 
possibly related to durvalumab and gemcitabine/cisplatin.

As expected, the incidence of imAES was higher in the experimental durvalumab arm (13%) than in the 
placebo arm (5%). The incidence of imAEs in the experimental arm was lower compared to that in the 
D pan-tumour pool (15%). Importantly, most of the imAEs in the durvalumab arm were of low grade 
(35 out of 43 patients, 81%) and the proportion of serious imAEs was identical (1.8%) in both arms. 
About two thirds of the patients (28 out of 41) in the durvalumab arm received corticosteroids for imAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 116/142 
 
 
 
 
and about half received supplementary endocrine treatment. Discontinuation of durvalumab on account 
of imAEs occurred in 3 patients of the durvalumab arm. 
The  median  time  to  resolution  for  imAEs  for  the  patients  that  reported  resolution  (46%  in  the  D  + 
Gem/Cis  group  and  40%  in  the  placebo  +  Gem/Cis  group  at  the  time  of  DCO)  was  54  days  in  the 
durvalumab arm and 50 days in the placebo arm.  
Following  the  known  imAE  pattern  of  durvalumab,  immune-mediated  hypothyroid  events  (37%  of  all 
imAEs) and dermatitis/rash events (26%) were the most frequent imAE in the D + Gem/Cis arm. More 
severe imAEs of diarrhoea/colitis or pneumonitis occurred in a minority of patients. None of the imAEs 
had outcome of death. A Serious imAE row is provided for each of the system categories (Table 50). Any 
SAE was only seen in 0-2 patients by category. 
In 6.2% of patients (22 patients) from the D + Gem/Cis arm the imAE was considered as unresolved, 
compared with 2.0% of patients in the placebo arm. 13 of the 22 patients with an unresolved imAE in 
the durvalumab arm experienced an imAE within the AESI category of “hypothyroid events”, which is in 
line with the rates reported in the D pan-tumor pool. The majority of the patients who experienced an 
imAE  not recovered or recovering at DCO were for endocrine events, which take long time to recover 
or are never considered as recovered since patients sometimes need to take endocrine therapy for life.  
Hepatic events: 
Table 51. Hepatic SMQ adverse events in any category – subject level (Safety analysis set)  
Incidence of overall hepatic AEs (not only imAEs) was comparable across both arms of TOPAZ-1: 27% 
and 26% in the D + Gem/Cis and Placebo + Gem/Cis treatment arms, respectively, also similar to 27% 
in the D pan-tumour pool. G3/4 hepatic AEs were comparably distributed at 9.5%, 12.6% and 11.0%, 
respectively.

Despite an apparent high number of patients who fulfilled potential Hy’s law criteria in both arms (36 in 
the D + Gem/Cis arm and 50 in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm), none of the cases were confirmed upon further 
review. The potential cases in the D+ Gem/Cis arm were fewer than in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm.

Cholangitis and biliary tract infections: 
Table 53. Cholangitis events in any category – subject level (Safety analysis set) 
Table 54. Biliary infection events in any category – subject level (Safety analysis set) 
BTC  patients,  especially  patients  with  previous  history  of  or  with  concomitant  drainage  internally  or 
externally  are  very  prone  to  cholangitis  and  biliary  tract  infections  (different  names  for  events  of  the 
same spectrum) and especially under treatment. This type of infections was much more common in the 
D + Gem/Cis arm (15%) than in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (8.5%), and as expected, most were serious 
events  that  required  hospitalisation,  but  the  majority  of  patients  recovered  with  antibiotic  treatment. 
Only a patient died in these circumstances and another one discontinued treatment because of biliary 
tract infection. 
Almost all patients with serious biliary tract infection across both treatment groups were treated with 
antibiotics and the majority of patients recovered or were recovering at the time of DCO: 16 out of 19 
patients in the D + Gem/Cis arm vs 4 out of 8 patients from the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm, without significant 
impact to study treatment. Upon case review of the individual cases, the characteristics of these events 
were  similar  across  both  treatment  groups,  with  most  events  being  serious.  None  of  the  cases  were 
suggestive  of  immune-mediated  aetiology,  and  none  of  the  patients  were  treated  with  systemic 
corticosteroids.  A  review  of  baseline  characteristics  of  patients  who  experienced  biliary  tract  infection 
events did not show any meaningful trends considering the infrequent number of events  in a smaller 
sample size of patient population.

Even that it seems not the case that the condition of cholangitis is related to durvalumab, it is certain 
that it was more frequent in the experimental arm. The risk for cholangitis to happen worsens when the 
patency for metallic/plastic stents exceeds 3-4 months.

Because  of  the  mechanism  of  action  of  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  to  block  inhibitory  signal  that 
prevents activation of T cells, there is a potential that these drugs may cause immune-mediated adverse 
drug  reactions.  An  automated  process  was  implemented  for  identifying  imAEs  that  does  not  involve 
human adjudication and is programmatically reproducible.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology: 
Table 56. Clinically Important Changes in Hematology Parameters (Safety Analysis Set) 
Changes in haematology parameters are very common in patients receiving chemotherapy. The changes 
in the D pan-tumour pool are therefore lower compared with the two treatment arms. The changes in 
haematology are equally distributed between the two treatment arms (Table 56). 
Chemistry:

The proportion of patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality 
in the TOPAZ-1 study was as follows: 6.6% for alanine aminotransferase increased, 7.5% for aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, 6.3% for amylase increased and 13.8% for lipase increased. This was in 
line with what was observed in the placebo-treated patients. 
Regarding  chemistry  parameters  corresponding  to  the  function  of  the  kidneys  as  sodium,  potassium, 
magnesium and creatinine, changes from baseline were slightly more pronounced in the D + Gem/Cis 
arm compared to the placebo + Gem/Cis arm (the frequency of acute kidney events was also higher in 
the D + Gem/Cis arm compared to the placebo + Gem/Cis arm).  There were no significant differences 
observed in the other chemistry parameters. 
In patients treated with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who 
experienced  a  shift  from  baseline  to  a  Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormality  was  as  follows:  6.4%  for 
alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  6.5%  for  aspartate  aminotransferase  increased,  4.2%  for  blood 
creatinine  increased,  6.4%  for  amylase  increased,  and  11.7%  for  lipase  increased.  The  proportion  of 
patients who experienced a TSH shift from baseline that was ≤ ULN to any grade > ULN was 20.3% and 
a TSH shift from baseline that was ≥ LLN to any grade < LLN was 24.1%.

By race, no overall significant differences were observed, although a slight trend towards a worse safety 
profile  of  durvalumab  in  the  “Black/African  American”  subgroup  of  patients  is  observed.  However,  no 
firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  from  this  observation  since  the  number  of  patients  belonging  to  this 
subgroup was extremely small (8 patients). No meaningful differences were observed with respect to 
geographic region.  
In  line  with  the  results  observed  in  the  other  subgroups,  no  significant  differences  were  observed 
depending on the baseline ECOG/WHO performance status (0/1). 
Interpretation of the safety results according to intrinsic and extrinsic factors:  
Age group: Across all age groups there were no clinically meaningful differences seen in the safety profile 
regarding AEs all grades and imAEs between the two treatment groups. A slight trend towards a decrease 
of “any AE possibly related to durvalumab” as age increases is observed. 
Sex: No clinically meaningful differences were observed. The frequencies reported were generally higher 
in males in both treatment groups, but the numbers are very small. 
Race: No overall significant differences were observed. The frequencies reported were generally higher 
in Black or African American people. This was consistent across the two treatment groups. The number 
of patients belonging to this subgroup was however small (8 patients). 
Performance status – ECOG: There was no difference in the frequencies of AEs and imAEs between ECOG 
PS 0 and 1. This was also similar across the two treatment groups. 
Geographic regions: There were no clinically differences in the safety profile. 
PD-L1 TIP 1% status: For any AE category there was not seen any meaningful differences, with regard 
to TAP<1% and TAP≥1% between the two treatment groups (Table 64). Minor differences in some 
categories can be due to the low numbers. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with durvalumab. PK drug-drug interaction 
of durvalumab with other therapeutics is not anticipated given that durvalumab is not primarily cleared 
via  hepatic  or  renal  pathways;  instead,  the  primary  elimination  pathways  are  protein  catabolism  via 
reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition.

Discontinuations:

Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Any Study Treatment by Preferred Term

AEs leading to discontinuations were observed in similar proportions across the D + Gem/Cis (13%) 
and Placebo + Gem/Cis (15%) arms.  
Dose modifications: 
Dose reduction of durvalumab due to AEs were not allowed. Dose modification of durvalumab included 
only dose delay, dose interruption, and permanent treatment discontinuation. 
AEs leading to dose modification of durvalumab were comparable overall for the D + Gem/Cis group in 
TOPAZ-1 and the D pan-tumour pool (36.1% vs 29.0%, respectively), and when considered by PTs.

Dose modifications occurred in a slightly higher proportion of patients from the D + Gem/Cis arm 
(36%) as compared to the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (29%). An overview of AEs leading to dose modification 
split according to durvalumab/placebo or chemotherapy and occurring in more than 1 patient is 
depicted in Table 66 and Table 67. The most frequent AEs that led to dose modification of Gem/Cis in 
the D + Gem/Cis vs the placebo + Gem/Cis groups were neutrophil count decreased (20.7% vs 
24.0%), neutropenia (21.0% vs 20.8%), platelet count decreased (11.2% vs 11.1%), anaemia (8.3% 
vs 7.0%), white blood cell decrease (5.3% vs 5.8%) and thrombocytopenia (3.8% vs 6.7%). The most 
common AEs in both arms were haematological toxicities and were reported at a similar frequency. 
Post marketing experience 
This section is based on the latest Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER; reporting period 01 
May 2021 to 31 October 2021). 
Durvalumab  (IMFINZI)  was  first  approved  for  marketing  in  the  US  on  01  May  2017.  The  total  post-
marketing  exposure  of  durvalumab  since  launch  and  until  31  October  2021  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately 61181 patient-years (IMFINZI PBRER, 20 December 2021). No new safety concern has 
been identified based on the post-marketing safety reports. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Durvalumab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody (immune checkpoint inhibitor), currently marketed in Europe as 
monotherapy  for  maintenance  of  unresectable  stage  III  NSCLC  PD-L1  ≥1%  after  chemoradiotherapy 
(PACIFIC trial) and in combination with chemotherapy for ES-SCLC (CASPIAN trial). Durvalumab can be 
associated  with  immune-mediated  adverse  reactions  such  as  pneumonitis,  hepatitis,  colitis, 
endocrinopathies  (hyperthyroidism,  hypothyroidism,  adrenal  insufficiency,  type  1  DM,  hypophysitis), 
nephritis and rash/dermatitis. The overall safety profile of durvalumab is comparable to other checkpoint 
inhibitors approved in monotherapy or combination for the treatment of diverse cancers. 
Safety  data  to  support  the  current  application  for  durvalumab  as  add-on  to  gemcitabine/cisplatin 
chemotherapy in biliary tract cancer (BTC) comprehend both arms (D + Gem/Cis and Pbo + Gem/Cis) 
of  the  pivotal  TOPAZ-1  study  and  the  safety  data  cut-off  corresponds  to  that  of  the  primary  efficacy 
analysis (DCO 18-AUG-2021). The pivotal TOPAZ-1 study is still ongoing. The safety dataset (patients 
who received the assigned treatment) consisted of 680 patients: 338 patients in the D + Gem/Cis group 
and 342 patients in the Pbo + Gem/Cis group. Additionally, supportive results from and integrated pooled 
dataset  of  durvalumab  as  monotherapy  (D  pan-tumour  pool,  N=3006)  were  presented.  Such  pool 
comprised patients from 9 clinical studies who had received at least 1 dose of durvalumab monotherapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 133/142 
 
 
 
 
given  at  a  dose  of  either  10  mg/kg  Q2W  IV  or  20  mg/kg  Q4W  IV  for  any  line  of  therapy  and  across 
tumour types. All studies in the D pan-tumour pool used body weight-based monotherapy regimens of 
durvalumab, whereas flat dosing (1500 mg Q3W or Q4W) plus chemotherapy was used in the CASPIAN 
study  (ES-SCLC),  the  POSEIDON  study  (NSCLC)  and  now  in  the  TOPAZ-1  trial  (BTC).  The  safety  of 
IMFINZI  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  is  based  on  pooled  data  in  603 patients  from  2 studies 
(TOPAZ-1 and CASPIAN). 
The safety profile of durvalumab in the intended indication is unavoidably affected by the gemcitabine + 
cisplatin  chemotherapy  backbone  of  TOPAZ-1.  Regarding  study  design,  it  is  important  to  note  an 
induction  period  in  which  durvalumab  is  combined  with  a  finite  number  of  chemotherapy  cycles  (4  in 
CASPIAN, 8 in TOPAZ-1), followed by a durvalumab maintenance as monotherapy.  
Exposure: Median exposure was similar in both arms of TOPAZ-1 during the induction (combination with 
chemotherapy) phase of the trial, whereas slightly longer in the maintenance phase for the D+ Gem/Cis 
arm. Overall, the median duration of exposure was longer with D+Gem/Cis (7.33 months) compared to 
placebo + Gem/Cis (5.77 months). Correspondingly, the median number of durvalumab cycles was 10 
vs. 8 of placebo. In the chemotherapy period, the median duration of Gem and Cis were comparable in 
the two treatment arms. That said, it seems that durvalumab did not influence negatively on the duration 
of chemotherapy treatment and the patients were able to tolerate up to 8 cycles of Gem/Cis when given 
in combination with durvalumab. 
Considering  the  increase  in  sample  size  that  took  place  while  the  study  was  ongoing  (refer  to  the 
statistical methods section), it is important to point out that data cut-off for the primary analysis took 
place about 10 months after recruiting the last patient, which is deemed an appropriate period for safety 
follow-up  (for  the  overall  safety  dataset),  particularly  when  considering  median  survival  of  a  year  in 
patients with advanced BTC. 
AEs: As expected, nearly all patients in the D + Gem/Cis arm (99.4%) and in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm 
(98.8)  from  pivotal  TOPAZ-1  study  experienced  any  Grade  AEs.  Incidence  of  the  most  common  AEs 
(≥10%) in the D + Gem/Cis arm was overall comparable to that in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm: anaemia 
(48.2% vs 44.7%), nausea (40.2% vs 34.2%), constipation (32.0% vs 28.9%), neutropenia (31.7% vs 
29.8%), fatigue (26.9% vs 26.3%), neutrophil count decrease (26.9% vs 31.0%), decreased appetite 
(25.7% vs 23.1%) and platelet count decreased (20.7% vs 23.1%). It is reassuring that none of the 
known  imAEs  usually  related  to  durvalumab  presented  with  higher  than  expected  incidence.  The 
percentage of AEs that were possibly related to any study treatment was similar between arms: 93% in 
the D + Gem/Cis arm and 90% in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm. 
The fact that more AEs were generally seen in the durvalumab and placebo arm in the TOPAZ-1 study 
compared to the pool is likely due to added chemotherapy in TOPAZ-1. Overall, the incidence of any AEs, 
high-grade (≥G3) AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation and modification/interruption of 
treatment  were  overall  comparable  across  both  experimental  (D  +  Gem/Cis)  and  control  (Pbo  + 
Gem/Cis) arms of TOPAZ-1. 
High-grade (G3/4) AEs: The incidence of AEs of grade 3 or 4 (frequency ≥2%) in the D + Gem/Cis arm 
was overall similar to that seen in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm, noting anaemia (23.7% vs 22.5%), neutrophil 
count decrease (21.0% vs 25.7%), neutropenia (20.1% vs 21.1%), platelet count decrease (9.8% vs 
8.5%), and thrombocytopenia (4.7% vs 5.3%). Most of these high-grade AEs relate to the chemotherapy 
backbone from both arms, but the incidence of cholangitis is doubled in the D + Gem/Cis arm (6.5%) in 
comparation to the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (3.2%). However, the characteristics of these events were similar 
across both treatment groups, with most events being serious. None of the cases were suggestive of 
immune-mediated aetiology, and none of the patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids.

The  percentage  of  high-grade  (≥G3)  AEs  which  were  considered  as  possibly  related  to  durvalumab 
(10.9%)  was  similar  to  the  percentage  of  the  AEs  which  were  considered  as  possibly  related  to 
durvalumab in the D pan-tumour pool (11.0%), suggesting that adding chemotherapy to durvalumab 
does not increase the toxicity of durvalumab. 
SAEs: Acknowledging the expected toxicity from backbone chemotherapy and the trend for biliary tract 
infections  in  patients  with  BTC  (often  in  relationship  to  history  of  instrumentation  and  invasive  tract 
procedures), SAEs occurred in nearly half of the safety population, slightly more often in the D + Gem/Cis 
arm (47%) in comparison to the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (44%). The most common SAEs (frequency ≥1%) 
were cholangitis (7.4% vs 5.0%), pyrexia (3.8% vs 2.3%), anaemia (3.6% vs 1.2%), sepsis (3.3% vs 
2.6%),  acute  kidney  injury  (2.4%  vs  1.2%)  and  biliary  obstruction  (1.8%  vs  2.0%),  respectively. 
Importantly, however, biliary stenting and drainage procedures during treatment were not more frequent 
in the D + Gem/Cis arm (17%) than in the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (18%). Of note, SAEs causally-related 
to study treatment by the investigator occurred in a similar proportion across both arms: 16% in the D 
+  Gem/Cis  arm  vs.  17%  in  the  Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  arm.  Besides  the  4  cases  of  cerebrovascular  events 
leading to death in the D + Gem/Cis arm, there were SAEs of ischemic stroke in two additional patients 
from the same arm.  
Deaths: At IA-2, 424 deaths had occurred, 198 in the D + Gem/Cis arm (58% of n=341) and 226 in the 
Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  arm  (66%  of  n=344).  As  expected,  most  of  these  deaths  were  attributable  to  the 
underlying cancer. AEs with outcome of death were observed in 12 patients from the D + Gem/Cis arm 
and  14  in  the  Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  arm.  Regarding  causality,  as  expected,  infections  were  the  main  AE 
associated to death in these 26 patients (4 in D + Gem/Cis, 5 in Pbo + Gem/Cis). Death from biliary 
sepsis only occurred in one patient from the D + Gem/Cis arm. Death from hepatic failure occurred in 
another patient from the D + Gem/Cis arm. Unexpectedly, 4 patients in the D + Gem/Cis (vs. none in 
the  control  arm)  died  from  nervous  system  AEs,  ischaemic  or  haemorrhagic  strokes  in  all  cases. 
Additionally, there is another case of a patient whose cause of death is labelled as “sudden death”, but 
who had initially been related to an ‘embolus’. However, abbreviated narratives provided by the MAH 
showed  that  three  of  the  four  patients  had  pre-existing  and/or  ongoing  risk  factors  (in  addition  to 
malignancy). 
imAEs: As expected, the incidence of imAES was higher in the experimental D + Gem/Cis arm (13%) 
than in the control Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (5%). Importantly, the incidence of imAEs in the experimental 
arm compared to that in the D pan-tumour pool (15%) was slightly lower than that at the experimental 
arm of the CASPIAN trial (20%). It is further reassuring that most of the imAEs in the D + Gem/Cis arm 
were of low grade (35 out of 43 patients, 81%) and the incidence of serious imAEs was identical in both 
arms  (1.8%).  About  two  thirds  of  the  patients  (28  out  of  41)  in  the  D  +  Gem/Cis  arm  received 
corticosteroids for imAEs and about half received supplementary endocrine treatment. Discontinuation 
of durvalumab on account of imAEs occurred in 3 patients of the D + Gem/Cis arm. Following the known 
imAE  pattern  of  durvalumab,  immune-mediated  hypothyroid  events  (37%  of  all  imAEs)  and 
dermatitis/rash events (26%) were the most frequent imAE in the D + Gem/Cis arm. More severe imAEs 
of diarrhoea/colitis or pneumonitis occurred in a minority of patients of the experimental arm. None of 
the  imAEs  had  outcome  of  death.  As  expected,  a  low  number  of  subjects  were  considered  to  have 
recovered at the moment of IA-2. No further information on this matter is deemed necessary.  
Cholangitis/biliary  tract  infections:  Patients  with  BTC  often  need  instrumentation  and/or  invasive 
procedures for internal or external biliary drainage, which usually implies higher incidence of cholangitis 
and biliary tract infections (different names for events in the same infectious disease spectrum). This 
type of infections was much more common in the D + Gem/Cis arm (15%) than in the Pbo + Gem/Cis 
arm (8.5%), and as expected, most were high/grade and/or serious events that required hospitalisation, 
although  the  majority  of  patients  recovered  with  antibiotic  treatment.  Only  a  patient  died  in  these 
Assessment report

circumstances  and  another  one  discontinued  treatment  because  of  biliary  tract  infection.  A  review  of 
baseline  characteristics  in  patients  who  experienced  biliary  tract  infection  events  did  not  show  any 
meaningful  trends,  noting  the  limited  number  of  patients  with  these  events.  However,  a  specific 
subsection “Disease-specific precaution (BTC) – Cholangitis” on increased risk of cholangitis depending 
on patency of the metallic/plastic stent has been added as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
ADRs:  A  comparison  of  the  ADRs  based  on  independent  review  vs.  programmatic  adjudication  was 
performed,  since  this  concerns  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  However,  overall,  no  relevant  differences 
between  the  imAEs  frequencies  according  to  manual  and  programmatic  process  are  observed.  The 
frequency of hypothyroidism was the only imAE category that met the requested threshold of a difference 
of  ≥0.5%  patients  between  the  rates  derived  by  manual  vs.  automated  processes.  However,  in  each 
case,  the  automated  process  resulted  in  a  higher  rate  of  hypothyroidism  as  compared  to  the  manual 
process and thus does not underestimate the frequency of these events. Across the studies, there were 
only  3  categories  (“hepatic  events”  and  “other  rare/miscellaneous”  in  the  TOPAZ-1  study;  and 
“dermatitis/rash” in the CASPIAN study) in which the frequency of imAEs adjudicated by a programmatic 
process  were  lower  than  the  imAEs  adjudicated  by  a  manual  process,  and  the  difference  was  only  1 
patient in each category. 
The ADRs from studies CASPIAN and TOPAZ-1 were merged in order to simplify section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
implying that information about the use of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy results in a 
single column. For the time being, it is considered that this safety dataset is sufficient to characterize 
the  safety  profile  of  durvalumab  monotherapy  compared  with  durvalumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy.   
Laboratory findings:  Shifts in haematology parameters are balanced in both arms and likely related to 
the  chemotherapy  backbone.  Shifts  in  renal  chemistry  parameters  occurred  with  slightly  higher 
frequency in the D + Gem/Cis arm, but still in a minority of patients. 
Safety  in  special  populations:  No  significant  differences  were  observed  regarding  “any  AE”  or  G3-4 
categories across age, race, geographic region or ECOG subgroups. Safety in relationship to both intrinsic 
and extrinsic factors did not show any meaningful differences. Comparison of safety profile in TAP<1% 
and TAP≥1% between two treatment groups in TOPAZ-1 did not show any meaningful differences either. 
Minor differences in some categories can be explained by the low numbers. In studies PACIFIC, CASPIAN 
and TOPAZ-1 data on safety for patients 75 years and older are too limited to draw a conclusion on this 
population. 
AEs leading to discontinuation were observed in similar proportions across the D + Gem/Cis (13%) and 
Placebo  +  Gem/Cis  (15%)  arms.  As  expected,  most  of  these  AEs  were  likely  related  to  backbone 
chemotherapy. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The extent and maturity of the safety database provided from the experimental (durvalumab + Gem/Cis, 
n=338) and control (placebo + Gem/Cis, n=342) arms of pivotal TOPAZ-1 trial are deemed appropriate 
for evaluation of the safety profile of added durvalumab in the intended advanced BTC setting. Overall, 
the  incidence  of  any  AEs,  high-grade  AEs,  SAEs,  AEs  with  outcome  of  death  and  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  is  comparable  across  both  arms.  It  does  not  seem  that  durvalumab  exacerbates  the 
known adverse reactions of chemotherapy and, reassuringly, it does not seem that durvalumab has an 
impact on patients’ tolerability to chemotherapy. The incidence of imAEs is higher in the durvalumab + 
chemotherapy arm, but most of these were of low grade and manageable.

2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7 succession 2 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 7 succession 2 with the following content: 
Safety concerns 
There are no safety concerns. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
There are no safety concerns, so only routine pharmacovigilance activities are required. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable as there are no safety concerns. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to cholangitis and biliary tract infections has 
been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
A readability test was performed for the original dossier and provided during the assessment of the initial 
dossier. This variation aims at extending the indication for durvalumab to be used in combination with 
chemotherapy for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). 
The same route of administration (intravenous use) and age group (adults) is applicable to this variation. 
The package leaflet is being updated in section 1 and 4 and are otherwise similar to the text previously 
tested at the time of the  MAA. The changes are not considered  too significant and an additional user 
consultation is not considered necessary for this new indication.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The final agreed indication is as follows:  
IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults 
with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC). 
Biliary 
tract  cancer  (BTC)  refers 
to  a  spectrum  of 
invasive  adenocarcinomas, 
including 
cholangiocarcinoma (cancers arising in the intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal biliary tree), and gallbladder 
carcinoma. Over 75% of patients with BTC present at a late unresectable stage. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Surgery  is  the  cornerstone  of  treatment  of  BTC,  but  only  a  minority  of  patients  are  diagnosed  at  a 
resectable stage. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC, multiple regimens are available 
as  first  line  systemic  treatment,  the  most  frequent  being  cisplatin  or  oxaliplatin  in  combination  with 
gemcitabine.  Despite  treatment,  however,  most  patients  progress  within  months  and  overall  survival 
since  diagnosis  approaches  one  year.  Second  line  treatments  are  scant  and  of  modest  efficacy. 
Pemigatinib was approved in 2021 for patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma 
with FGFR-2 who have progressed after at least one prior line of systemic therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  results  from  a  double-blind  and  randomised  phase  III  trial  with  add-on 
design,  TOPAZ-1,  comparing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  durvalumab  +  gemcitabine/cisplatin  (D  + 
Gem/Cis, n=341) to placebo + gemcitabine/ cisplatin (Pbo + Gem/Cis, n=344).  
685  patients  were  recruited  between  April  2019  and  December  2020,  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression 
status.  Stratification  factors  were  disease  status  (de  novo  vs.  recurrent  disease)  and  primary  tumour 
site (IHCC vs. EHCC vs. GC). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were 
PFS, ORR, DOR (all by investigator, both in ITT and according to PD-L1 status) and QoL. Updated OS 
results (DCO 25 February 2022) were submitted as supportive data. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
•  At data cutoff corresponding to IA-2 (11 August 2021), 424 deaths had occurred (62% of overall OS 
maturity) in the ITT. The study met its primary endpoint and the analysis is thus considered final: 
the stratified HR for OS showed statistical superiority of D + Gem/Cis vs. Pbo + Gem/Cis: 0.80 (97% 
CI 0.64, 0.99), p-value 0.021. K-M estimates of median OS are 12.8 months and 11.5 months in Pbo 
+ Gem/Cis, respectively, for an approximate median survival gain of 1.3 months. An exploratory OS 
analysis  performed  at  data  cut  off  25  February  2022,  when  517  OS  events  had  occurred  (77%  of 
overall OS maturity) provided similar data: median OS remains nearly unchanged (12.9 months in 
the experimental arm vs. 11.3 months in the control arm) and nominal HR for OS is 0.76. 
Assessment report  
EMA/29546/2023  
Page 138/142 
 
 
 
•  At the data cutoff of 11 August 2021, 573 investigator-assessed PFS events had occurred (84% of 
overall  PFS  maturity)  in  the  ITT  population.  Overall  PFS  data  support  survival  results,  showing  an 
advantage for the D + Gem/Cis arm (median PFS 7.2 months) over SoC Gem/Cis (median PFS 5.7 
months), with a HR of 0.75 (95.19% CI 0.63, 0.89), and p-value of 0.001. 
•  Confirmed ORR was 27% in the experimental arm and 19% in the control arm. Median DOR did not 
differ in responders across both arms (6.4 and 6.2 months, respectively), but the K-M curves show 
sustained response beyond 9 months in a minority of patients from the D + Gem/Cis arm. 
•  The  beneficial  OS  and  PFS  effect  from  added  durvalumab  to  Gem/Cis  is  maintained  across  the 
predefined subgroups and sensitivity analyses. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  The  observed  median  survival  and  progression-free  survival  advantage  from  the  addition  of 
durvalumab to standard-of-care chemotherapy is modest, of ~1.5 months for each parameter. 
•  There  is  not  enough  evidence  to  establish  PD-L1  expression  as  a  predictive  factor  of  response  to 
immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in BTC. 
•  Fluke-related cholangiocarcinoma has a different, and more complex mutational burden. Data about 
its  different  prognosis  is  limited  and  how  this  may  influence  the  response  to  immunotherapy  is 
unknown. Although it seems unlikely that data from TOPAZ-1 study could address these uncertainties 
(since  there  is  no  data  about  subjects  with  a  previous  history  of  fluke  infection),  an  exploratory 
analysis  that  groups  patients  from  fluke-endemic  countries  (Thailand,  South  Korea,  Japan  and 
Taiwan)  showed  a  trend  for  improved  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  when  compared  to  patients 
recruited in other countries. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
•  Most common AEs (incidence ≥10%) in the D+ Gem/Cis arm compared with the Pbo + Gem/Cis 
arm were anaemia (48.2% vs 44.7%), nausea (40.2% vs 34.2%), constipation (32.0% vs 28.9%), 
neutropenia  (31.7%  vs  29.8%),  fatigue  (26.9%  vs  26.3%),  neutrophil  count  decrease  (26.9%  vs 
31.0%), decreased appetite (25.7% vs 23.1%) and platelet count decreased (20.7% vs 23.1%). The 
majority of such AEs relate to the chemotherapy backbone.  
•  The  most  frequent  high-grade  (G3/4)  AEs  (incidence  ≥2%)  were  also  likely  related  to 
chemotherapy: anaemia (23.7% D+ Gem/Cis vs 22.5% Pbo + Gem/Cis), neutrophil count decrease 
(21.0%  vs  25.7%),  neutropenia  (20.1%  vs  21.1%),  platelet  count  decrease  (9.8%  vs  8.5%), 
cholangitis (6.5% vs 3.2%) and thrombocytopenia (4.7% vs 5.3%).  
•  SAEs  occurred  in  nearly  half  of  the  ITT,  slightly  more  often  in  the  D  +  Gem/Cis  arm  (47%)  in 
comparison  to  the  Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  arm  (44%).  The  most  common  SAEs  (frequency  ≥1%)  were 
cholangitis  (7.4%  vs  5.0%),  pyrexia  (3.8%  vs  2.3%),  anaemia  (3.6%  vs  1.2%),  sepsis  (3.3%  vs 
2.6%), acute kidney injury (2.4% vs 1.2%) and biliary obstruction (1.8% vs 2.0%), respectively. 
•  AEs with outcome of death were observed in 12 patients from the D + Gem/Cis arm and 14 in the 
Pbo  +  Gem/Cis  arm.  Regarding  causality,  as  expected,  infections  were  the  main  associated  AE  to 
death in these 26 patients (4 in durvalumab, 5 in placebo). 4 patients in the D + Gem/Cis (vs. none 
in the control arm) died from cerebrovascular events. 
•  Expectedly, the incidence of imAES was higher in the experimental D+ Gem/Cis arm (13%) than in 
the Pbo + Gem/Cis arm (5%). Importantly, the incidence of imAEs in the experimental arm compared

to that in the D pan-tumour pool (15%) and was slightly lower than that of the experimental arm of 
the CASPIAN trial, which also included chemotherapy (20%). Most imAEs were of low-grade (G1/2) 
and  manageable  with  corticosteroid  and  endocrine  treatment.  The  most  frequent  imAEs  from 
durvalumab were hypothyroidism and rash/dermatitis.  
•  AEs leading to discontinuation were observed in similar proportions across the D + Gem/Cis (13%) 
and Placebo + Gem/Cis (15%) arms. As expected, most of these AEs were likely related to backbone 
chemotherapy. 
•  None  of  the  known  imAEs  usually  related  to  durvalumab  presented  with  higher  than  expected 
incidence in the experimental D+ Gem/Cis arm.  
•  An increased risk of cholangitis has been reported mostly in association with biliary stent (see section 
4.4 of the SmPC). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Limited data are overall available from the safety profile of durvalumab as add-on to chemotherapy.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
About  75%  of  patients  with  biliary  tract  cancer  (intrahepatic  or  extrahepatic  cholangiocarcinoma, 
gallbladder carcinoma) are diagnosed in an advanced stage, i.e., unresectable or metastatic disease. 
Systemic  chemotherapy  with  a  platinum  compound  (cisplatin  or  oxaliplatin)  in  combination  with 
gemcitabine  is  the  current  standard-of-care  in  the  frontline  approach  for  unresectable  or  metastatic 
biliary tract cancer and limited choices of treatment are available upon progression. Overall survival of 
these patients approaches one year despite treatment and a clear unmet need exists for these patients: 
no new regimens have proved more efficacious in the last 10 years.  
The results from TOPAZ-1 highlight a marginal survival benefit from added durvalumab (~1.5 months) 
as  compared  to  placebo,  which  is  nevertheless  a  relevant  clinical  advantage  for  these  patients  with 
dismal  prognosis  and  scant  options  for  subsequent  treatment.  The  survival  benefit  is  supported  by 
secondary endpoints as assessed by investigator (PFS, ORR, DOR). The totality of available data does 
not allow to conclude that PD-L1 status is a predictive factor for improved outcome in advanced BTC. 
This is the first immunochemotherapy trial with a positive statistical outcome in the intended setting, 
noting that such regimen currently constitute the recommended frontline approach across several other 
advanced cancers: NSCLC, ES-SCLC, TNBC, HNSCC, oesophageal carcinoma. 
Considering  the  beneficial  effects  observed  in  the  intended  indication,  the  limited  safety  data  from 
durvalumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  do  not  give  rise  to  major  concerns.  The  incidence  of 
imAEs  is  noticeable,  but  most  of  them  correspond  to  hypothyroidism  or  rash/dermatitis  and  can  be 
managed following toxicity guidelines.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The survival benefit from adding durvalumab to SoC gemcitabine/cisplatin in unresectable or metastatic 
advanced cancer is considered clinically relevant in view of the poor prognosis of this aggressive disease 
and the manageable safety profile. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imfinzi for the targeted therapeutic indication is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of indication to include IMFINZI in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the first-line 
treatment  of  adults  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  biliary  tract  cancer  (BTC),  based  on  the  second 
interim  analysis  from  the  ongoing  pivotal  study  D933AC00001  (TOPAZ-1);  a  phase  III  randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-regional, international study conducted to assess the efficacy and 
safety  of  durvalumab  in  combination  with  the  current  standard  of  care  Gemcitabine/Cisplatin  for  the 
first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic BTC. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated and the Package leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. 
Version 7.2 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Imfinzi is not similar to Pemazyre within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

Simoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 1440 amino 
acids. The amino acid sequence is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of human plasma factor VIII 
(i.e. B-domain deleted). Nuwiq is produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified 
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. No animal or human derived materials are added during 
the manufacturing process or to the final medicinal product. 
Excipient with known effect 
One mL of reconstituted solution contains 7.35 mg sodium (18.4 mg sodium per vial). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). 
Nuwiq can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical 
interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation 
analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. 
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
factor VIII activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor VIII activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Also there can 
be significant discrepancies between assay results obtained by aPTT-based one stage clotting assay 
and the chromogenic assay according to Ph. Eur. This is of importance particularly when changing the 
laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.

Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which is 
related to the current WHO concentrate standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in 
plasma is expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or preferably in 
International Units (relative to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to the quantity of factor VIII in one 
mL of normal human plasma.  
On-demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 
approximately 2% of normal activity or 2 IU/dL. The required dose is determined using the following 
formula:  
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) (IU/dL) x 0.5 (IU/kg per IU/dL) 
Expected factor VIII rise (% of normal) =   2 x administered IU 
  body weight (kg) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. The following table can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery.

Prophylaxis 
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 
20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days. The regimen may be adjusted 
based on patient response. 
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Paediatric population 
The posology is the same in adults and children and adolescents, however, shorter dose intervals or 
higher doses may be necessary for children and adolescents. Currently available data are described in 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Method of administration 
Nuwiq is for intravenous use. 
It is recommended that not more than 4 mL per minute be administered. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Nuwiq 
contains traces of human host cell proteins other than factor VIII. If symptoms of hypersensitivity 
occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately and contact 
their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including 
hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 50 
exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.  
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Cardiovascular events  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children and adolescents. 
Excipient related considerations (sodium content) 
This medicinal product contains 18.4 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.92 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with Nuwiq. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII.  
Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII 
during pregnancy and breast feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during 
pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. There are no fertility data available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Nuwiq has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angiooedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, rash, restlessness, 
tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, urticaria, including generalised urticaria, vomiting, 
wheezing) have rarely been observed with FVIII preparations and may in some cases progress to 
severe anaphylaxis (including shock).  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with Nuwiq. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an 
insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre 
be contacted. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred 
Term Level). Frequencies are based on reports from clinical trials with a total of 355 unique subjects 
with severe haemophilia A, of which 247 were previously treated patients (PTPs) and 108 were 
previously untreated patients (PUPs). 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥1/10); 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
A non-neutralizing anti-factor VIII antibody was detected in one adult patient (see Table 1). The 
sample was tested by the central laboratory at eight dilutions. The result was positive only at dilution 
factor 1 and the antibody titre was very low. Inhibitory activity, as measured by the modified Bethesda 
assay, was not detected in this patient. Clinical efficacy and in vivo recovery of Nuwiq was not 
affected in this patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code: B02BD02. 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, 
factor VIII binds to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a 
cofactor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. 
Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin 
and a clot can be formed. Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due 
to decreased levels of factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as results of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the 
plasma levels of factor VIII are increased, thereby temporarily enabling a correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Adult and adolescent population 12 - 65 years of age 
Prophylaxis  
In a clinical study in 32 adult patients with severe haemophilia A, the median consumption of Nuwiq 
for prophylaxis was 468.7 IU/kg/month. 
Treatment of bleeding  
The median dose to treat break-through bleeding episodes was 33.0 IU/kg in these patients who were 
on prophylaxis. In another clinical study, 22 adult patients were treated on demand.  In total 986 
bleeding episodes were treated with a median dose of 30.9 IU/kg. In general, minor bleeds required 
slightly lower, and more severe bleeds required up to three-fold higher median doses. 
Individualised prophylaxis  
Individualised PK-based prophylaxis was evaluated in 66 adult PTPs with severe haemophilia A. 
Following a 1-3 month standard prophylaxis phase (every other day or 3 times weekly dosing), 44 
(67%) patients were switched to a dosing regimen based on their PK assessment, and 40 completed the 
6 months of prophylaxis according to the assigned dosing and treatment scheme. Of these patients, 34 
(85%) were treated twice weekly or less. 33 (82.5%) patients did not experience any bleeds and 36 
(90.0%) patients had no spontaneous bleeds. The mean ± SD annualised bleeding rate was 1.2 ± 3.9 
and the mean ± SD dose were 52.2 ± 12.2 IU/kg per injection and 99.7 ± 25.6 IU/kg per week.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
Paediatric population 
Data were obtained in 29 previously treated children between 2 and 5 years of age, 31 children 
between 6 and 12 years of age and one adolescent of 14 years. The median dose per prophylactic 
infusion was 37.8 IU/kg. Twenty patients used median doses of more than 45 IU/kg. The median 
consumption of Nuwiq for prophylaxis per month was 521.9 IU/kg. A higher median dose of Nuwiq 
was required to treat bleedings in children (43.9 IU/kg) than in adults (33.0 IU/kg), and a higher 
median dose was required to treat moderate to major than minor bleedings (78.2 IU/kg vs. 41.7 IU/kg). 
Younger children in general required higher median doses (6-12 years: 43.9 IU/kg; 2-5 years: 
52.6 IU/kg). These data were corroborated by a long-term follow-up of 49 of these children who were 
treated for an additional median period of approximately 30 months (range from 9.5 to 52 months); 
during this period 45% of children had no spontaneous bleeds. 
Data from 108 previously untreated patients with severe haemophilia A (<1% FVIII:C) were obtained 
in a prospective open-label clinical study. In the majority of patients prophylactic treatment was 
initiated after the occurrence of the first bleeding episode requiring treatment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In pre-clinical studies, Nuwiq was used to safely and effectively restore haemostasis in dogs with 
haemophilia. Toxicology studies showed that local intravenous administration and systemic exposure 
were well tolerated in laboratory animals (rats and cynomolgus monkeys). 
Specific studies with long-term repeated administration such as reproduction toxicity, chronic toxicity, 
and carcinogenicity were not performed with Nuwiq due to the immune response to heterologous 
proteins in all non-human mammalian species. 
No studies were performed on the mutagenic potential of Nuwiq.  
Ex vivo evaluations using a commercial assay kit to quantify T cell response to protein therapeutics 
indicate a low risk of immunogenicity.

6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Each pack contains: 
-  1 powder vial with 250, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000 or 4000 IU simoctocog alfa in a 
type 1 glass vial, closed with coated bromobutyl stopper and sealed with aluminium flip-off cap 
-  Solvent: 1 borosilicate pre-filled glass syringe containing 2.5 mL water for injections 
-  1 sterile vial adapter for reconstitution with 1 butterfly needle and 2 alcohol swabs  
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL water for injections) using 
the supplied injection set. The vial should be gently rotated until all powder is dissolved. After 
reconstitution, the solution should be drawn back into the syringe.  
The reconstituted medicinal product should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration. The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear, colourless 
solution, free from foreign particles and has a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.  Do not use solutions that are cloudy or 
have deposits. 
Instructions for preparation and administration 
1.  Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach 
room temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as 
your hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature 
should be maintained during reconstitution. 
2.  Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the 
rubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  
3.  Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  
4.  Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the 
package.  
5.  Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the 
vial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the 
adapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the 
vial when done. 
12 
 
 
 
 
  
6.  Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end 
and do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe 
plunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. 
7.  Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of 
the cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used 
immediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. 
8.  Remove the adapter packaging and discard. 
9.  Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is 
felt. 
13 
 
 
 
10.  Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. 
11.  Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve 
the powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. 
12.  Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be 
clear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are 
cloudy or have deposits. 
13.  Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the 
syringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  
14.  Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the 
empty vial. 
14 
 
 
 
15.  The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. 
16.  Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. 
17.  Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. 
Insert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make 
the vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. 
No blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. 
18.  Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. 
If you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle 
again. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Nuwiq is and what it is used for 
Nuwiq contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII (simoctocog alfa). 
Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleeding. In patients with haemophilia A 
(inborn factor VIII deficiency), factor VIII is missing or not working properly. 
Nuwiq replaces the missing factor VIII and is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients 
with haemophilia A and can be used for all age groups.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Nuwiq 
Do not use Nuwiq 
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance simoctocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Nuwiq. 
There is a rare chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to Nuwiq. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions as they are listed in 
section 4 “Allergic reactions”.  
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child´s bleeding is not being controlled with Nuwiq, tell your doctor immediately. 
Cardiovascular events  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Nuwiq. 
So, every time you get a new package of Nuwiq, note down the date and the batch number (which is 
on the packaging after Lot) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Other medicines and Nuwiq 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Nuwiq has no influence on your ability to drive and use machines.  
Nuwiq contains sodium 
This medicine contains 18.4 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 0.92 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Nuwiq 
Treatment with Nuwiq will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or nurse has told you. Check with 
your doctor or nurse if you are not sure. 
Nuwiq is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or a nurse who are experienced in 
the care of patients with haemophilia A. You or someone else might also give your Nuwiq injection, 
but only after receiving adequate training. 
Your doctor will calculate your dose of Nuwiq (in international units = IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. How 
often you need an injection will depend on how well Nuwiq is working for you. Usually, treatment for 
haemophilia A is a life-long treatment. 
Prevention of bleeding 
The usual dose of Nuwiq is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, given every 2 to 3 days. However, in 
some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may be necessary. 
Treatment of bleeding 
The dose of Nuwiq is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.  
If you have the impression that the effect of Nuwiq is insufficient, talk to your doctor. Your doctor 
will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor VIII levels. This 
is particularly important if you are having major surgery. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients developing factor VIII inhibitors 
If your plasma factor VIII fails to reach expected levels with Nuwiq, or if bleeding is not adequately 
controlled, it could be due to the development of factor VIII inhibitors. This will be checked by your 
doctor. You might need a higher dose of Nuwiq or a different product to control bleedings. Do not 
increase the total dose of Nuwiq to control your bleeding without consulting your doctor. 
Use in children and adolescents 
The way Nuwiq is used in children and adolescents does not differ from the way it is used in adults. 
Because factor VIII products may have to be given more often in children and adolescents, a central 
venous access device (CVAD) may need to be fitted. A CVAD is an external connector that allows 
access to the bloodstream through a catheter without injection through the skin. 
If you use more Nuwiq than you should 
No symptoms of overdose have been reported. If you have injected more Nuwiq than you should, 
please inform your doctor. 
If you forget to use Nuwiq 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next dose immediately 
and continue as advised by your doctor. 
If you stop using Nuwiq 
Do not stop using Nuwiq without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Please stop using this medicine immediately and seek urgent medical advice if: 
- 
you notice symptoms of allergic reactions 
Allergic reactions may include rash, hives, urticaria (itchy rash), including generalized 
urticaria, swelling of lips and tongue, shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, 
vomiting, restlessness, low blood pressure, and dizziness. These symptoms can be early 
symptoms of an anaphylactic shock. If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur 
(very rare: may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people), the injection must be stopped immediately, 
and you must contact your doctor right away. Severe symptoms require prompt emergency 
treatment. 
you notice that the medicine stops working properly (bleeding is not stopped or becomes 
- 
frequent)  
For children and adolescents not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitor 
antibodies (see section 2) may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients). 
However, for patients who have received previous treatment with factor VIII (more than 150 
days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens, your or 
your child´s medicines may stop working properly and you or your child may experience 
persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. 
Common side effects may affect up to 1 in 10 people 
Hypersensitivity, fever. 
Uncommon side effects may affect up to 1 in 100 people 
Tingling or numbness (paraesthesia), headache, dizziness, vertigo, dyspnoea, dry mouth, back pain, 
injection site inflammation, injection site pain, a vague feeling of bodily discomfort (malaise), 
haemorrhagic anaemia, anaemia, chest pain, non-neutralising antibody positive (in previously treated 
patients). 
48

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
1.  Allow the solvent syringe (water for injections) and the powder in the closed vial to reach 
room temperature. You can do this by holding them in your hands until they feel as warm as 
your hands. Do not use any other way to heat the vial and pre-filled syringe. This temperature 
should be maintained during reconstitution. 
2.  Remove the plastic flip-off cap from the powder vial to expose the central portions of the 
rubber stopper. Do not remove the gray stopper or metal ring around the top of the vial.  
3.  Wipe the top of the vial with an alcohol swab. Allow the alcohol to dry.  
4.  Peel back the paper cover from the vial adapter package. Do not remove the adapter from the 
package.  
5.  Place the powder vial on an even surface and hold it. Take the adapter package and place the 
vial adapter over the centre of the rubber stopper of the powder vial. Press down firmly the 
adapter package until the adapter spike penetrates the rubber stopper. The adapter snaps to the 
vial when done. 
53 
 
 
  
6.  Peel back the paper cover from the pre-filled syringe package. Hold the plunger rod at the end 
and do not touch the shaft. Attach the threaded end of the plunger rod to the solvent syringe 
plunger. Turn the plunger rod clockwise until a slight resistance is felt. 
7.  Break off the tamper-proof plastic tip from the solvent syringe by snapping the perforation of 
the cap. Do not touch the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. In case the solution is not used 
immediately close the filled syringe with the tamper-proof plastic tip for storage. 
8.  Remove the adapter packaging and discard. 
9.  Firmly connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by turning clockwise until resistance is 
felt.

10.  Slowly inject all solvent into the powder vial by pressing down the plunger rod. 
11.  Without removing the syringe, gently move or swirl the vial in circles a few times to dissolve 
the powder. Do not shake. Wait until all the powder dissolves completely. 
12.  Visually inspect the final solution for particles before administration. The solution should be 
clear and colourless, practically free from visible particles. Do not use solutions that are 
cloudy or have deposits. 
13.  Turn the vial attached to the syringe upside down, and slowly draw the final solution into the 
syringe. Make sure that the entire content of the vial is transferred to the syringe.  
14.  Detach the filled syringe from the vial adapter by turning counter clockwise and discard the 
empty vial.

15.  The solution is now prepared for immediate use. Do not refrigerate. 
16.  Clean the chosen injection site with one of the provided alcohol swabs. 
17.  Attach the provided infusion set to the syringe. 
Insert the needle of the infusion set into the chosen vein. If you have used a tourniquet to make 
the vein easier to see, this tourniquet should be released before you start injecting the solution. 
No blood must flow into the syringe due to the risk of formation of fibrin clots. 
18.  Inject the solution into the vein at a slow speed, not faster than 4 mL per minute. 
If you use more than one vial of powder for one treatment, you may use the same injection needle 
again. The vial adapter and the syringe are for single use only.

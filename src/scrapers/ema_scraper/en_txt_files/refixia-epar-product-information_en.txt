*recombinant human factor IX, produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant 
DNA technology, covalently conjugated to a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG). 
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia one-stage clotting test. The 
specific activity of Refixia is approximately 144 IU/mg protein. 
Refixia is a purified recombinant human factor IX (rFIX) with a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 
selectively attached to specific N-linked glycans in the rFIX activation peptide. Upon activation of 
Refixia, the activation peptide including the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol moiety is cleaved off, leaving 
the native activated factor IX molecule. The primary amino acid sequence of the rFIX in Refixia is 
identical to the Ala148 allelic form of human plasma-derived factor IX. No additives of human or 
animal origin are used in the cell culture, purification, conjugation, or formulation of Refixia.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX 
deficiency). 
Refixia can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
Routine monitoring of factor IX activity levels for the purpose of dose adjustment is not necessary. In 
the clinical trial programme, dose adjustment was not performed. Mean steady state factor IX trough 
levels ≥ 15% were observed for all age groups, see section 5.2 for details. 
Due to the interference of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the one-stage clotting assay with various aPTT 
reagents, it is recommended to use a chromogenic assay (e.g. Rox Factor IX or Biophen) when 
monitoring is needed. If a chromogenic assay is not available, it is recommended to use a one-stage 
clotting assay with an aPTT reagent (e.g. Cephascreen) qualified for use with Refixia. For modified 
long-acting factor products, it is known that the one-stage clotting assay results are highly dependent 
on the aPTT reagent and reference standard used. For Refixia, some reagents will cause 
underestimation (30–50%), while most silica containing reagents will cause severe overestimation of 
the factor IX activity (more than 400%). Therefore, silica based reagents should be avoided. Use of a 
reference laboratory is recommended when a chromogenic assay or a qualified one-stage clotting 
assay is not available locally. 
Posology 
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed 
either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an 
International Standard for factor IX in plasma). 
Prophylaxis 
40 IU/kg body weight once weekly. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels 
and individual bleeding tendency. The trough levels achieved with the weekly 40 IU/kg dosing 
regimen are summarised in section 5.2. 
Patients on prophylaxis who forget a dose are advised to take their dose upon discovery and thereafter 
continue with the usual once weekly dosing schedule. A double dose should be avoided.

Additional doses can be given if needed.  
Pre-operative dose. 
Consider two repeated doses of 40 IU/kg 
(in 1–3 day intervals) within the first 
week after surgery. 
Due to the long half-life of Refixia, the 
frequency of dosing in the post-surgical 
period may be extended to once weekly 
after the first week until bleeding stops 
and healing is achieved. 
Paediatric population 
The dose recommendations in children are the same as for adults (for more details on paediatrics see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2).

Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Refixia is administered by intravenous bolus injection over several minutes after reconstitution of the 
powder for injection with the histidine solvent. The rate of administration should be determined by the 
patient’s comfort level up to a maximum injection rate of 4 ml/min. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
In case of self-administration or administration by caregiver appropriate training is needed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Known allergic reaction to hamster protein. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity  
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Refixia. The product contains traces of 
hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use 
of the medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the 
early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, 
wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis.  
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.  
Inhibitors  
After repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for 
the development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units 
(BU) using appropriate biological testing.  
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated 
for the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.  
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administrations of factor IX 
should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical observation 
where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided.  
In case of residual FIX activity levels, there is a risk of interference when performing the Nijmegen 
modified Bethesda assay for inhibitor testing. Therefore a pre-heating step or a wash-out is 
recommended in order to ensure detection of low-titre inhibitors.  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thromboembolism  
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications, clinical surveillance for early signs of 
thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing when 
administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born 
infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. In each of these situations, the benefit 
of treatment with Refixia should be weighed against the risk of these complications.  
Cardiovascular event  
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FIX may increase the 
cardiovascular risk.  
Catheter-related complications  
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.  
Paediatric population  
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to children and adults.  
Sodium content  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. In case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into 
consideration.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No interactions of human coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor IX. Based on the rare occurrence of 
haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX should be used during pregnancy and lactation only 
if clearly indicated. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Refixia has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely with recombinant factor IX products and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis 
(including shock). In some cases, these reactions have progressed to severe anaphylaxis, and they have 
occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX inhibitors (see also section 4.4). 
Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance induction in 
haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Very rarely development of antibodies to hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions has 
been observed. 
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such 
inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it 
is recommended that a specialised haemophilia centre is contacted. 
There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX 
products, with a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has 
been associated with instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX products like Refixia is 
rarely associated with such adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The table presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level). 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very 
rare (< 1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
A total of 115 previously treated patients (PTPs) and 50 previously untreated patients (PUPs) with 
moderate or severe haemophilia B have been exposed to Refixia for a total of 434 patient years in the 
completed and on-going clinical trials.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Factor IX inhibition and anaphylactic reactions have not been observed in PTPs, and frequencies are 
therefore based on an ongoing PUP trial with 50 patients. In this trial, Factor IX inhibition occurred in 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4/50 (8%) and anaphylactic reaction occurred in 1/50 (2%) categorising these events as common. The 
case with anaphylactic reaction occurred in a patient that also developed Factor IX inhibition. 
Paediatric population 
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar as in adults. . 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose  
Overdoses up to 169 IU/kg have been reported in clinical trials. No symptoms associated with 
overdoses have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX, ATC code: B02BD04.  
Mechanism of action  
Refixia is a purified recombinant human factor IX (rFIX) with a 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 
conjugated to the protein. The average molecular weight of Refixia is approximately 98 kDa and the 
molecular weight of the protein moiety alone is 56 kDa. Upon activation of Refixia, the activation 
peptide including the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol moiety is cleaved off, leaving the native activated 
factor IX molecule.  
Factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein. It is a vitamin-K dependent coagulation factor and it is 
synthesised in the liver. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa and by factor VII/tissue factor complex. 
Activated factor IX, in combination with activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X 
converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is 
formed. Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased 
levels of factor IX and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles, or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels 
of factor IX are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and 
correction of the bleeding tendencies.  
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical trial programme included one phase 1 trial and five phase 3 multicentre, non-controlled 
trials. All patients had severe (factor IX level < 1%) or moderately severe (factor IX level ≤ 2%) 
haemophilia B.  
Of note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical trials.  
Prophylaxis  
One hundred one of the previously treated patients and previously untreated patients across all age-
groups were treated with a weekly prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg where 40 (40%) of these patients had 
no bleeding episodes (see details below).  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pivotal trial  
The pivotal trial included 74 adolescent (13–17 years) and adult (18–65 years) previously treated 
patients (PTPs). The trial included one open-label on-demand arm with treatment for approximately 
28 weeks and two prophylaxis treatment arms with single-blind randomisation to either 10 IU/kg or 
40 IU/kg once-weekly for approximately 52 weeks. When comparing the 10 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg 
treatments, the annualised bleeding rate for patients in the 40 IU/kg arm was found to be 49% lower 
than the bleeding rate (95% CI: 5%;73%) for patients in the 10 IU/kg arm (p<0.05).  
The median (IQR) overall ABR in patients (13–65 years) treated with a prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg 
once weekly was 1.04 (0.00; 4.01) whereas the traumatic ABR was 0.00 (0.00; 2.05), joint ABR was 
0.97 (0.00; 2.07) and spontaneous ABR was 0.00 (0.00; 0.99).  
In this pivotal trial in adolescent and adult patients, there were 70 breakthrough bleeding episodes for 
16 out of 29 patients in the 40 IU/kg prophylaxis arm. The overall success rate for treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds was 97.1% (67 out of 69 evaluated bleeds). A total of 69 (98.6%) of the 70 
bleeding episodes were treated with one injection. Bleeding episodes were treated with Refixia at 
40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds.  
In 29 adult and adolescent patients treated, 13 patients with 20 target joints were treated for one year 
with a weekly prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg. Eighteen out of these 20 joints (90%) were no longer 
considered target joints at the end of the trial.  
On-demand treatment  
In the pivotal trial there was a non-randomised arm where 15 patients were treated in an on-demand 
regimen with 40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds and 80 IU/kg for severe bleeds. The overall 
success rate (defined as excellent or good) for treatment of bleeds was 95% with 98% of the bleeds 
treated with one or two injections.  
Paediatric population  
Previously treated patients (PTPs)  
The efficacy and safety of Refixia for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds were evaluated in an open-
label, single arm, non-controlled phase 3 trial. In the main phase of the paediatric PTP trial, 25 patients 
initially enrolled at 0 to 12 years of age received routine prophylactic administration of Refixia 
40 IU/kg once weekly for 52 weeks. The patients were stratified into two age groups; 12 patients were 
0 to 6 years and 13 patients 7 to 12 years at the time of signing informed consent. Twenty-two patients 
continued on to the extension phase and out of those, 12 patients had up to 8 years of routine 
prophylactic treatment. Due to the long trial duration several patients crossed age-groups and 10 
patients that were initially enrolled as ≤ 6 years also contributed to the age category of 7-12 years. 
Main efficacy results in patients ≤ 12 years separated by main and extension phase are summarised in 
table 4.

For the main and extension phase of the trial together, the overall median/poisson-estimated ABR was 
0.55/1.02 (95% CI: 0.68; 1.54) in patients ≤ 6 years and 0.52/0.84 (95% CI: 0.41; 1.75) in patients 7-
12 years. The median/poisson-estimated ABR was 0/0.2 (95% CI: 0.09; 0.47) and 0/0.23 (95% CI: 
0.05; 0.96) for spontaneous bleeds as well as 0.53/0.82 (95% CI: 0.55; 1.23) and 0.33/0.56 (95% CI: 
0.25; 1.27) for traumatic bleeds in patients ≤ 6 years and patients 7-12 years, respectively. Treatment 
success (defined as excellent or good response) was concluded for 88.6% and 93.7% of bleeding 
episodes that occurred during prophylaxis in patients ≤ 6 years and patients 7-12 years, respectively. 
Five out of 25 patients (20%) did not have any bleeds throughout the trial.The mean annual 
consumption for prophylaxis was 2 208.6 (SD: 78.8) IU/kg and 2 324.8 (SD: 83.3) IU/kg for patients 
≤ 6 years and patients 7-12 years, respectively. Two patients had target joints at baseline, which were 
considered resolved during the main phase. None of the patients developed new target joints in the 
trial.  
Previously untreated patients (PUPs)  
The efficacy and safety of Refixia for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds were evaluated in an open-
label, single-arm multicentre non-controlled phase 3 trial. In the main phase of the paediatric PUP 
trial, 47 out of 50 patients < 6 years old received 40 IU/kg once weekly and 38 patients continued on 
to the extension phase. Main efficacy results separated by main and extension phase are summarised in 
table 5.

The overall median ABR was 0 for spontaneous, traumatic, and joint bleeding episodes. For the trials 
main and extension phase the median/poisson-estimated ABR was 0.25/0.65 (95% CI: 0.34; 1.25) for 
PUPs on prophylaxis. The poisson-estimated ABRs for spontaneous and traumatic bleeds were 0.14 
(95% CI: 0.05; 0.43) and 0.2 (95% CI: 0.05; 0.81) throughout the trial period, respectively (the median 
ABRs was 0 for both).46.8% of PUPs did not experience any bleeding events. None of the paediatric 
patients developed target joints in the trial. The overall success rate (defined as excellent or good) for 
treatment of bleeds in previously untreated patients was 96% (135 out of 140). Of the 140 treated 
bleeds observed in 34 (68%) out of 50 patients, 124 (89%) of the bleeds were resolved with 1 injection 
and 13 (9%) of the bleeds were resolved with 2 injections of Refixia.  
Overall haemostatic efficacy  
Bleeding episodes were treated with Refixia at 40 IU/kg for mild or moderate bleeds or 80 IU/kg for 
severe bleeds, where one bleed was evaluated as severe. An overall assessment of haemostatic efficacy 
was performed by the patient or caretaker (for home treatment) or study site investigator (for treatment 
under health care professional supervision) using a 4-point scale of excellent, good, moderate, or poor.  
The overall success rate (defined as excellent or good) for treatment of bleeds in previously treated 
patients was 92% (626 out of 683). Of the 677 treated bleeds observed in 84 (80%) of the 105 patients, 
590 (86%) of the bleeds were resolved with 1 injection and 70 (10%) of the bleeds were resolved with 
2 injections of Refixia.

The success rate and dose needed for treatment of the bleeding episodes were independent of the 
localisation of the bleed. The success rate for treatment of bleeding episodes was also independent of 
whether the bleed was traumatic or spontaneous of nature.  
Surgery  
Three trials, of which one trial was a dedicated surgery trial, included in total 15 major and 26 minor 
surgery procedures (patients aged 13 to 56 years). Haemostatic effect of Refixia during surgery was 
confirmed with a success rate of 100% in the 15 major surgeries in the trials. All evaluated minor 
surgeries were performed successfully.  
In a dedicated surgery trial, the efficacy analysis included 13 major surgical procedures performed in 
13 previously treated adult and adolescent patients. The procedures included 9 orthopaedic, 1 
gastrointestinal, and 3 surgeries in the oral cavity. The patients received 1 pre-operative injection of 
80 IU/kg on the day of surgery, and post-operatively, injections of 40 IU/kg. A pre-operative dose of 
80 IU/kg Refixia was effective and no patients required additional doses on the day of surgery. In the 
post-surgery period Day 1 to 6 and Day 7 to 13, the median number of additional 40 IU/kg doses 
administered was 2.0 and 1.5, respectively. The mean total consumption of Refixia during and after 
surgery was 241 IU/kg (range: 81–460 IU/kg).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Refixia has a prolonged half-life compared to unmodified factor IX. All pharmacokinetic studies with 
Refixia were conducted in previously treated patients with haemophilia B (factor IX ≤2%). The 
analysis of plasma samples was conducted using the one-stage clotting assay.  
Steady state pharmacokinetic parameters for adolescents and adults are shown in Table 6

As expected, body weight adjusted clearance in paediatric and adolescent patients was higher 
compared to adults. No dose adjustment was required for paediatric or adolescent patients in clinical 
trials. 
The mean trough levels at steady state are presented in Table 8; based on all pre-dose measurements 
taken every 8 weeks at steady state for all patients on once weekly dosing of 40 IU/kg.

* Factor IX trough levels = factor IX activity measured prior to next weekly dose (5 to 10 days post dosing) at steady state.  
Pharmacokinetics were investigated in 16 adult and adolescent patients of which 6 were normal weight 
(BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m2) and 10 were overweight (BMI 25–29.9 kg/m2). There were no apparent 
differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles between normal weight and overweight patients.  
In the paediatric PTP trial, the Factor IX mean trough levels at steady state were within the range of 
mild haemophilia (i.e. 0.05–0.4 IU/ml), independent of age.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the paediatric PUP trial, the estimated mean trough level at steady state was 0.15 IU/ml in patients 
< 6 years old, i.e., within the range of mild haemophilia.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
A juvenile animal neurotoxicity study was conducted to evaluate the potential neurotoxicity of Refixia 
when intravenously administered 120-1 200 IU/kg/twice weekly in immature male rats from 3 to 
13 weeks of age (corresponding to 2 to 16 years of age in humans), followed by a 13-week treatment-
free period. The doses were 6-60 times higher than the weekly clinical dose of 40 IU/kg. PEG was 
detected by immunohistochemical staining in the choroid plexus, pituitary, circumventricular organs, 
and cranial motor neurons. Dosing Refixia to juvenile rats did not result in any functional or 
pathological effects, as measured by neurobehavioural/neurocognitive tests, including motor activity, 
sensory function, learning and memory as well as growth, sexual maturation, and fertility.  
In a repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys, mild and transient body tremors were seen 3 hours post 
dosing and abated within 1 hour. These body tremors were seen at doses of Refixia (3 750 IU/kg), 
which were more than 90 times higher than the recommended dose for humans (40 IU/kg). No 
mechanism behind the tremors was identified. Tremors have not been reported in the clinical trials.  
Non-clinical data reveal no concern for humans based on conventional safety pharmacology and 
repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys. 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) was detected 
by immunohistochemical staining in epithelial cells of choroid plexus in the brain. This finding was 
not associated with tissue damage or abnormal clinical signs. 
In distribution and excretion studies in mice and rats, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety of 
Refixia was shown to be widely distributed to and eliminated from organs, and excreted via plasma in 
urine (42–56%) and faeces (28–50%). Based on modelled data using observed terminal half-lives (15–
49 days) in rat tissue distribution studies, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety will reach 
steady state levels in all human tissues within 1–4.5 years of treatment. 
The exposure ratios for PEG in the choroid plexus, measured in animals at the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) versus predicted clinical PEG-exposure, ranged from 5-fold in the juvenile rat 
neurotoxicity study to 6-fold in the 26-week repeat dose toxicity study in adult rats. 
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Refixia, or studies to determine 
the effects of Refixia on genotoxicity, fertility, development, or reproduction have not been performed.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Refixia is and what it is used for  
What Refixia is  
Refixia contains the active substance nonacog beta pegol. It is a long-acting version of factor IX. 
Factor IX is a protein naturally found in the blood that helps to stop bleeding.  
What Refixia is used for  
Refixia is used to treat and prevent bleeding in all age groups of patients with haemophilia B (inborn 
factor IX deficiency).  
In patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or does not work properly. Refixia replaces this 
faulty or missing factor IX and helps blood to form clots at the site of bleeding.  
2.  What you need to know before you use Refixia  
Do not use Refixia  
• 
if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed 
in section 6).  
if you are allergic to hamster proteins.  
• 
If you are not sure if either of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor before using this medicine.

Warnings and precautions  
Traceability  
It is important to keep a record of the batch number of your Refixia. So, every time you get a new 
package of Refixia, note down the date and the batch number (which is on the packaging after Lot) 
and keep this information in a safe place.  
Allergic reactions and development of inhibitors  
There is a rare risk that you may experience a sudden and severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylactic 
reaction) to Refixia. Stop the injection and contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if 
you have signs of an allergic reaction such as rash, hives, weals, itching of large areas of skin, redness 
and/or swelling of lips, tongue, face or hands, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, shortness of 
breath, wheezing, tightness of the chest, pale and cold skin, fast heartbeat, and/or dizziness.  
Your doctor may need to treat you promptly for these reactions. Your doctor may also carry out a 
blood test to check if you have developed factor IX inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against your 
medicine, as inhibitors may develop together with allergic reactions. If you have such inhibitors, you 
may have a higher risk of sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reaction) during 
future treatment with factor IX.  
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, your initial treatment with Refixia should be 
given in a medical clinic or in the presence of health care professionals where proper medical care for 
allergic reactions can be provided if needed.  
Talk to your doctor immediately if your bleeding does not stop as expected or if you have to 
significantly increase the amount of Refixia you need to stop a bleed. Your doctor will do a blood test 
to check if you have developed inhibitors (neutralising antibodies) against Refixia. The risk for 
developing inhibitors is highest in people who have have not been treated with factor IX medicines 
before, typically small children.  
Blood clots  
Tell your doctor, if any of the following apply to you as there is an increased risk of blood clots during 
treatment with Refixia:  
• 
• 
• 
you have recently had surgery 
you suffer from other serious illness e.g. liver disease, heart disease, or cancer 
you have risk factors for heart disease e.g high blood pressure, obesity, or smoking. 
Kidney disorder (nephrotic syndrome)  
There is a rare risk of developing a specific kidney disorder called “nephrotic syndrome” following 
high doses of factor IX in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic 
reactions.  
Catheter-related problems  
If you have a central venous access device (CVAD), you may develop infections or blood clots at the 
site of the catheter.  
Other medicines and Refixia  
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using Refixia.  
Driving and using machines  
Refixia has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Refixia contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. In case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into 
consideration.  
3. 
How to use Refixia  
Treatment with Refixia will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia B. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor 
if you are not sure about how to use Refixia.  
Your doctor will calculate the right dose for you. The dose will depend on your weight and what the 
medicine is being used for.  
Prevention of bleeding  
The usual dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. This is given as one 
injection every week. Your doctor may choose another dose or change how often the injections should 
be given, based on your need.  
Treatment of bleeding  
The usual dose of Refixia is 40 international units (IU) per kg of body weight. Depending on the 
location and the severity of bleeding you may need a higher dose (80 IU per kg) or extra injections. 
Discuss with your doctor the dose and number of injections you need.  
Use in children and adolescents  
Refixia can be used  in children and adolescents of all ages. The dose in children and adolescents is 
also calculated according to body weight and is the same dose as for adults.  
How Refixia is given  
Refixia is available as powder and solvent that is made up into a solution (reconstitution) and given as 
an injection into a vein. See “Instructions on how to use Refixia” for more information.  
If you use more Refixia than you should  
If you use more Refixia than you should, contact your doctor.  
If you have to significantly increase the amount of Refixia you need to stop a bleed, talk to your doctor 
immediately. For further information, see section 2 “Allergic reactions and development of inhibitors”.  
If you forget to use Refixia  
If you forget a dose, inject the missed dose as soon as you remember. Do not inject a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten dose. If you are in doubt contact your doctor.  
If you stop using Refixia  
If you stop using Refixia you may no longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not 
stop. Do not stop using Refixia without talking to your doctor.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.  
4. 
Possible side effects  
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Allergic reactions are possible with this medicine.  
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If sudden and severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reactions) occur, the injection must be 
stopped immediately. You must contact your doctor or an emergency unit immediately if you have 
early signs of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) such as:

Instructions on how to use Refixia 
Read these instructions carefully before using Refixia. 
Refixia is supplied as a powder. Before injection a solution must be made up (reconstituted) with 
the solvent supplied in the syringe. The solvent is a histidine solution. The reconstituted solution 
must be injected into a vein (intravenous (IV) injection). The equipment in this package is designed 
to reconstitute and inject Refixia. 
You will also need an infusion set (tubing and butterfly needle), sterile alcohol swabs, gauze pads 
and plasters. These items are not included in the Refixia package. 
Do not use the equipment without proper training from your doctor or nurse. 
Always wash your hands and ensure that the area around you is clean. 
When you prepare and inject medicine directly into the veins, it is important to use a clean and 
germ- free (aseptic) technique. Incorrect technique can introduce germs that can infect the blood. 
Do not open the equipment until you are ready to use it. 
Do not use the equipment if it has been dropped, or if it is damaged. Use a new package instead. 
Do not use the equipment if it has expired. Use a new package instead. The expiry date is printed 
on the outer carton, on the vial, on the vial adapter, and on the pre-filled syringe. 
Do not use the equipment if you suspect it is contaminated. Use a new package instead. 
Do not dispose of any of the items until after you have injected the reconstituted solution. 
The equipment is for single use only.

1. Prepare the vial and the syringe 
  A 
• 
• 
• 
Take out the number of Refixia 
packages you need. 
Check the expiry date. 
Check the name, strength and colour of 
the package, to make sure it contains the 
correct product. 
•  Wash your hands and dry them properly 
using a clean towel or air dry. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Take the vial, the vial adapter and the pre-
filled syringe out of the carton. Leave the 
plunger rod untouched in the carton. 
Bring the vial and the pre-filled syringe 
to room temperature. You can do this by 
holding them in your hands until they feel 
as warm as your hands. 
Do not use any other way to warm the 
vial and pre-filled syringe. 
Remove the plastic cap from the vial. If 
the plastic cap is loose or missing, do 
not use the vial. 
  B 
•  Wipe the rubber stopper with a sterile 
alcohol swab and allow it to air dry for a 
few seconds before use to ensure that it is 
as germ free as possible. 
• 
Do not touch the rubber stopper with 
your fingers as this can transfer germs. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Attach the vial adapter 
  C 
• 
Remove the protective paper from the 
vial adapter. 
If the protective paper is not fully 
sealed or if it is broken, do not use the 
vial adapter. 
Do not take the vial adapter out of the 
protective cap with your fingers. 
If you touch the spike on the vial adapter, 
germs from your fingers can be 
transferred. 
Place the vial on a flat and solid 
surface. 
  D 
Turn over the protective cap, and snap 
the vial adapter onto the vial. 
Once attached, do not remove the vial 
adapter from the vial. 
Lightly squeeze the protective cap with 
your thumb and index finger as shown. 
  E 
Remove the protective cap from the vial 
adapter. 
Do not lift the vial adapter from the vial 
when removing the protective cap. 
• 
• 
• 
3. Attach the plunger rod and the syringe 
  F 
• 
• 
Grasp the plunger rod by the wide top end 
and take it out of the carton. Do not touch 
the sides or the thread of the plunger 
rod. If you touch the sides or the thread, 
germs from your fingers can be 
transferred. 
Immediately connect the plunger rod to 
the syringe by turning it clockwise into 
the plunger inside the pre-filled syringe 
until resistance is felt. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Remove the syringe cap from the 
pre-filled syringe by bending it down until 
the perforation breaks. 
  G 
Do not touch the syringe tip under the 
syringe cap. If you touch the syringe tip, 
germs from your fingers can be 
transferred. 
If the syringe cap is loose or missing, do 
not use the pre-filled syringe. 
Screw the pre-filled syringe securely 
onto the vial adapter until resistance is 
felt. 
  H 
4. Reconstitute the powder with the solvent 
  I 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hold the pre-filled syringe slightly tilted 
with the vial pointing downwards. 
Push the plunger rod to inject all the 
solvent into the vial. 
Keep the plunger rod pressed down and 
swirl the vial gently until all the powder is 
dissolved. 
  J 
Do not shake the vial as this will cause 
foaming. 
Check the reconstituted solution. It 
must be clear and colourless to slightly 
yellow and no particles should be visible. 
If you notice particles or discolouration, 
do not use it. Use a new package instead. 
Refixia is recommended to be used immediately after it has been reconstituted. This is because 
if left, the medicine may no longer be sterile and could cause infections. 
If you cannot use the reconstituted Refixia solution immediately, it should be used within 
4 hours when stored at room temperature (up to 30 °C) and within 24 hours when stored in a 
refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C). Store the reconstituted product in the vial. 
Do not freeze reconstituted Refixia solution or store it in syringes. 
Keep reconstituted Refixia solution out of direct light. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your dose requires more than one vial, repeat steps A to J with additional vials, vial adapters and 
pre-filled syringes until you have reached your required dose. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Keep the plunger rod pushed 
completely in. 
  K 
Turn the syringe with the vial upside 
down. 
Stop pushing the plunger rod and let it 
move back on its own while the 
reconstituted solution fills the syringe. 
Pull the plunger rod slightly 
downwards to draw the reconstituted 
solution into the syringe. 
In case you only need part of the entire 
vial, use the scale on the syringe to see 
how much reconstituted solution you 
withdraw, as instructed by your doctor 
or nurse. 
If, at any point, there is air in the syringe, 
inject the air back into the vial. 
While holding the vial upside down, tap 
the syringe gently to let any air bubbles 
rise to the top. 
Push the plunger rod slowly until all air 
bubbles are gone. 
Unscrew the vial adapter with the vial. 
  L 
Do not touch the syringe tip. If you 
touch the syringe tip, germs from your 
fingers can be transferred. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Inject the reconstituted solution 
Refixia is now ready to inject into your vein. 
• 
• 
• 
Inject the reconstituted solution as instructed by your doctor or nurse. 
Inject slowly over 1 to 3 minutes. 
Do not mix Refixia with any other intravenous infusions or medicines. 
Injecting Refixia via needleless connectors for intravenous (IV) catheters 
Caution: The pre-filled syringe is made of glass and is designed to be compatible with standard 
luer-lock connections. Some needleless connectors with an internal spike are incompatible with the 
pre-filled syringe. This incompatibility may prevent administration of the medicine and/or result in 
damage to the needleless connector. 
Injecting the solution via a central venous access device (CVAD) such as a central venous catheter 
or a subcutaneous port: 
• 
Use a clean and germ-free (aseptic) technique. Follow the instructions for proper use for your 
connector and CVAD in consultation with your doctor or nurse. 
Injecting into a CVAD may require using a sterile 10 ml plastic syringe for withdrawal of the 
reconstituted solution. This should be done right after step J. 
If the CVAD line needs to be flushed before or after Refixia injection, use sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml solution for injection. 
• 
• 
Disposal 
  M 
• 
After injection, safely dispose of all 
unused Refixia solution, the syringe with 
the infusion set, the vial with the vial 
adapter and other waste materials as 
instructed by your pharmacist. 
Do not throw it out with the ordinary 
household waste.  
Do not disassemble the equipment before disposal. 
Do not reuse the equipment.

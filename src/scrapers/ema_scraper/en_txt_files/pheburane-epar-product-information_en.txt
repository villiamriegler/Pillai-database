3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Granules. 
White to off-white granules. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PHEBURANE is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of urea cycle disorders, 
involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase or 
argininosuccinate synthetase. 
It is indicated in all patients with neonatal-onset disease (complete enzyme deficiencies, presenting 
within the first 28 days of life). It is also indicated in patients with late-onset disease (partial enzyme 
deficiencies, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonaemic 
encephalopathy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
PHEBURANE treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of urea 
cycle disorders. 
Posology 
The daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient’s protein tolerance and the 
daily dietary protein intake needed to promote growth and development. 
The usual total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate in clinical experience is: 
 
 
450 - 600 mg/kg/day in neonates, infants and children weighing less than 20 kg. 
9.9 - 13.0 g/m2/day in children weighing more than 20 kg, adolescents and adults. 
The safety and efficacy of doses in excess of 20 g/day of sodium phenylbutyrate have not been 
established. 
Therapeutic monitoring  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasma levels of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), 
carnitine and serum proteins should be maintained within normal limits. Plasma glutamine should be 
maintained at levels less than 1,000 μmol/L. 
Nutritional management  
PHEBURANE must be combined with dietary protein restriction and, in some cases, essential amino 
acid and carnitine supplementation. 
Citrulline or arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with neonatal-onset form of 
carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency at a dose of 0.17 g/kg/day or 
3.8 g/m2/day. 
Arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with deficiency of argininosuccinate 
synthetase at a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g/kg/day or 8.8 - 15.4 g/m2/day. 
If caloric supplementation is indicated, a protein-free product is recommended. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate involves the liver and kidneys, 
PHEBURANE should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency. 
Method of administration 
PHEBURANE should be administered orally. Because of its slow dissolution, PHEBURANE should 
not be administered by nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. 
The total daily dose should be divided into equal amounts and given with each meal or feeding (e.g. 
4-6 times per day in small children). The granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, 
fruit juices, protein-free infant formulas) or sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed 
potatoes or apple sauce); in this case, it is important that it is taken immediately in order to preserve 
the taste-masking. 
The dose of PHEBURANE is expressed in grams of sodium phenylbutyrate. A calibrated measuring 
spoon is provided. It dispenses up to 3g of sodium phenylbutyrate by graduation of 250 mg. 
4.3  Contraindications 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Content of clinically important electrolytes 
 
 
PHEBURANE contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, 
corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the 
maximum daily dose. PHEBURANE should therefore be used with caution in patients with 
congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical conditions where there is 
sodium retention with oedema. 
Serum potassium should be monitored during therapy since renal excretion of 
phenylacetylglutamine may induce a urinary loss of potassium.

General considerations 
 
 
Even on therapy, acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy may occur in a number of patients. 
PHEBURANE is not recommended for the management of acute hyperammonaemia, which is 
a medical emergency. 
Excipients with known effect 
 
 
This medicinal product contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram granules, equivalent to 
6.2% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
The maximum daily dose of this medicinal product contains 2.5 g sodium per 20 gram 
granules, equivalent to 125% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium 
for an adult. 
PHEBURANE is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken into account for 
those on a low salt diet.  
This medicinal product contains 768 mg sucrose per gram granules. This should be taken into 
account in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concurrent administration of probenecid may affect renal excretion of the conjugation product of 
sodium phenylbutyrate. There have been published reports of hyperammonaemia being induced by 
haloperidol and by valproate. Corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and thus 
increase plasma ammonia levels. More frequent monitoring of plasma ammonia levels is advised 
when these medicinal products have to be used. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Effective contraceptive measures must be taken by women of child-bearing potential. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sodium phenylbutyrate in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Pheburane is contra-indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential 
must use effective contraception during treatment. 
Breast-feeding 
Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of sodium 
phenylbutyrate/metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). It is unknown whether sodium 
phenylbutyrate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Pheburane is contra-indicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
There is no evidence available on the effect of sodium phenylbutyrate on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
PHEBURANE has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
In clinical trials with sodium phenylbutyrate, 56 % of the patients experienced at least one adverse 
event and 78 % of these adverse events were considered as not related to sodium phenylbutyrate. 
Adverse reactions mainly involved the reproductive and gastrointestinal system. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the table below all adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. 
Frequency is defined as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from 
the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Decreased blood potassium, albumin, total 
protein and phosphate. Increased blood 
alkaline phosphatase, transaminases, bilirubin, 
uric acid, chloride, phosphate and sodium. 
Increased weight 
A probable case of toxic reaction to sodium phenylbutyrate (450 mg/kg/d) was reported in an 18-year 
old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic 
acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. She 
recovered following dose reduction except for recurrent pancreatitis episodes that eventually 
prompted treatment discontinuation. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.9  Overdose 
One case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g 
(1370 mg/kg). The patient developed diarrhea, irritability and metabolic acidosis with hypokalaemia. 
The patient recovered within 48 hours after symptomatic treatment. 
These symptoms are consistent with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting 
neurotoxicity when administered intravenously at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Manifestations of 
neurotoxicity were predominantly somnolence, fatigue and light-headedness. Less frequent 
manifestations were confusion, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory 
and exacerbation of a pre-existing neuropathy. 
In the event of an overdose, the treatment should be discontinued and supportive measures be 
instituted. Haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be beneficial.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary tract 
and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX03. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Sodium phenylbutyrate is a pro-drug and is rapidly metabolised to phenylacetate. Phenylacetate is a 
metabolically active compound that conjugates with glutamine via acetylation to form 
phenylacetylglutamine which is then excreted by the kidneys. On a molar basis, 
phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (each containing 2 moles of nitrogen) and therefore 
provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Based on studies of phenylacetylglutamine excretion in patients with urea cycle disorders it is 
possible to estimate that, for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, between 0.12 and 
0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced. As a consequence, sodium phenylbutyrate 
reduces elevated plasma ammonia and glutamine levels in patients with urea cycle disorders. It is 
important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is initiated immediately to improve the 
survival and the clinical outcome. 
In late-onset deficiency patients, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase 
deficiency, who recovered from hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and were then treated 
chronically with dietary protein restriction and sodium phenylbutyrate, the survival rate was 98 %. 
The majority of the patients who were tested had an IQ in the average to low average/borderline 
mentally retarded range. Their cognitive performance remained relatively stable during 
phenylbutyrate therapy. Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with 
treatment, and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients. 
PHEBURANE may be required life-long unless orthotropic liver transplantation is elected. 
Paediatric population 
Previously, neonatal-onset presentation of urea cycle disorders was almost universally fatal within 
the first year of life, even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their 
nitrogen-free analogues. With haemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways 
(sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, and, 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in newborns diagnosed after 
birth (but within the first month of life) increased to almost 80 % with most deaths occurring during 
an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. Patients with neonatal-onset disease had a 
high incidence of mental retardation. 
In patients diagnosed during gestation and treated prior to any episode of hyperammonaemic 
encephalopathy, survival was 100 %, but even in these patients, many subsequently demonstrated 
cognitive impairment or other neurologic deficits. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Phenylbutyrate is known to be oxidised to phenylacetate which is enzymatically conjugated with 
glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine in the liver and kidney. Phenylacetate is also hydrolysed by 
esterases in liver and blood. 
Plasma and urine concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites have been obtained from 
fasting normal adults who received a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and from patients 
with urea cycle disorders, haemoglobinopathies and cirrhosis receiving single and repeated oral doses 
up to 20 g/day (uncontrolled studies). The disposition of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites has also 
been studied in cancer patients following intravenous infusion of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 
2 g/m²) or phenylacetate. 
Absorption 
Phenylbutyrate is rapidly absorbed under fasting conditions. After a single oral dose of 5 g of sodium 
phenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate were detected 
15 minutes after dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 1 hour and the mean peak 
concentration 195 mcg/ml. The elimination half-life was estimated to be 0.8 hours. 
The effect of food on absorption is unknown. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of phenylbutyrate is 0.2 l/kg. 
Biotransformation 
After a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma 
levels of phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine were detected 30 and 60 minutes respectively 
after dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 3.55 and 3.23 hours, respectively, and the 
mean peak concentration was 45.3 and 62.8 μg/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life was 
estimated to be 1.3 and 2.4 hours, respectively. 
Studies with high intravenous doses of phenylacetate showed non-linear pharmacokinetics 
characterised by saturable metabolism to phenylacetylglutamine. Repeated dosing with phenylacetate 
showed evidence of an induction of clearance. 
In the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies receiving various doses 
of phenylbutyrate (300 - 650 mg/kg/day up to 20 g/day) no plasma level of phenylacetate could be 
detected after overnight fasting. In patients with impaired hepatic function the conversion of 
phenylacetate to phenylacetylglutamine may be relatively slower. Three cirrhotic patients (out of 6) 
who received repeated oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g/day in three doses) 
showed sustained plasma levels of phenylacetate on the third day that were five times higher than 
those achieved after the first dose. 
In normal volunteers gender differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate (AUC and Cmax about 30 - 50 % greater in females), but not 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenylacetylglutamine. This may be due to the lipophilicity of sodium phenylbutyrate and 
consequent differences in volume of distribution. 
Excretion 
Approximately 80 - 100 % of the medicinal product is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours as the 
conjugated product, phenylacetylglutamine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate (the active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) produced 
lesions in cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced 
in number (see section 4.6).  
When high doses of phenylacetate (190 - 474 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously to rat pups, 
decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons were observed, as well as a reduction in CNS 
myelin. Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded and the number of functioning nerve terminals in 
the cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth. (see section 4.6). 
Sodium phenylbutyrate was negative in 2 mutagenicity tests, i.e. the Ames test and the micronucleus 
test. Results indicate that sodium phenylbutyrate did not induce any mutagenic effects in the Ames 
test with or without metabolic activation. Micronucleus test results indicate that sodium 
phenylbutyrate was considered not to have produced any clastogenic effect in rats treated at toxic or 
non-toxic dose levels (examined 24 and 48 hours after a single oral administration of 878 to 
2800 mg/kg). 
Carcinogenicity and fertility studies have not been conducted with sodium phenylbutyrate.

9.9 - 13 g/m2/day in children weighing more than 20 kg. 
Method of administration 
PHEBURANE oral solution is for oral use.  
The total daily dose should be divided into equal amounts and given with each meal or feeding (e.g. 
4 – 6 times per day in small children).  
A dosing syringe with a press in bottle adapter (PIBA) is provided for accurate measurement of the 
prescribed dose of the oral solution. The PIBA allows to connect the dosing syringe to the bottle and 
to dose PHEBURANE oral solution.   
Only the dosing syringe provided with PHEBURANE oral solution should be used to measure a dose 
of PHEBURANE oral solution. No other devices/spoons/syringes should be used to administer 
PHEBURANE oral solution.  
The syringe is graduated in grams of sodium phenylbutyrate (from 0.5 g to 3 g of sodium 
phenylbutyrate. 
PHEBURANE oral solution can also be administered by nasogastric or gastrostomy tubes. 
Instructions for oral administration and administration via nasogastric or gastrostomy tube are 
provided in section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Content of clinically important electrolytes 
 
 
Each gram of PHEBURANE oral solution (2.86 mL of PHEBURANE oral solution) contains 
124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium. The maximum daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is 20 g 
(57.14 mL of PHEBURANE oral solution), this would bring an associated amount of: 2.5 g 
(108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose. 
PHEBURANE should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure 
or severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical conditions where there is sodium retention with 
oedema. 
Serum potassium should be monitored during therapy since renal excretion of 
phenylacetylglutamine may induce a urinary loss of potassium. 
General considerations 
 
 
Even on therapy, acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy may occur in a number of patients. 
PHEBURANE oral solution is not recommended for the management of acute 
hyperammonaemia, which is a medical emergency. 
Excipients with known effect 
PHEBURANE 350 mg/mL oral solution  
 
This medicinal product contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per g dose of sodium 
phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 6.2% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g 
sodium for an adult.  
The maximum daily dose of this medicinal product contains 2.5 g sodium , equivalent to

PHEBURANE oral solution is considered high in sodium. This should be particularly taken 
into account for those on a low salt diet. 
 
This medicinal product contains 5.7 mg aspartame per g dose of sodium phenylbutyrate. 
Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful for persons who have 
phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the 
body cannot remove it properly. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess 
aspartame (E951) use in infants below 12 weeks of age. 
Blackcurrant flavour topping 
The blackcurrant flavour topping contains 26.55 mg propylene glycol per drop. 
If your baby is less than 4 weeks old, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them this 
medicine, in particular if the baby is given other medicines that contain propylene glycol or alcohol.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
A probable case of toxic reaction to sodium phenylbutyrate (450 mg/kg/day) was reported in an 
18 - year old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with 
lactic acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis. She 
recovered following dose reduction except for recurrent pancreatitis episodes that eventually 
prompted treatment discontinuation. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
One case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g 
(1,370 mg/kg). The patient developed diarrhoea, irritability and metabolic acidosis with 
hypokalaemia. The patient recovered within 48 hours after symptomatic treatment. 
These symptoms are consistent with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting 
neurotoxicity when administered intravenously at doses up to 400 mg/kg/day. Manifestations of 
neurotoxicity were predominantly somnolence, fatigue and light-headedness. Less frequent 
manifestations were confusion, headache, dysgeusia, hypoacusis, disorientation, impaired memory 
and exacerbation of a pre-existing neuropathy. 
In the event of an overdose, the treatment should be discontinued and supportive measures be 
instituted. Haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis may be beneficial.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other alimentary tract and metabolism products, various alimentary 
tract and metabolism products, ATC code: A16AX03. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Sodium phenylbutyrate is a pro-drug and is rapidly metabolised to phenylacetate. Phenylacetate is a 
metabolically active compound that conjugates with glutamine via acetylation to form 
phenylacetylglutamine which is then excreted by the kidneys. On a molar basis, 
phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (each containing 2 moles of nitrogen) and therefore 
provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Based on studies of phenylacetylglutamine excretion in patients with urea cycle disorders it is 
possible to estimate that, for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, between 0.12 and 
0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced. As a consequence, sodium phenylbutyrate 
reduces elevated plasma ammonia and glutamine levels in patients with urea cycle disorders. It is 
important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is initiated immediately to improve the 
survival and the clinical outcome. 
In late-onset deficiency patients, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase 
deficiency, who recovered from hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and were then treated 
chronically with dietary protein restriction and sodium phenylbutyrate, the survival rate was 98%. 
The majority of the patients who were tested had an IQ in the average to low average/borderline 
mentally retarded range. Their cognitive performance remained relatively stable during 
phenylbutyrate therapy. Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with 
treatment, and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients. 
PHEBURANE oral solution may be required life-long unless orthotropic liver transplantation is 
elected. 
Paediatric population 
Previously, neonatal-onset presentation of urea cycle disorders was almost universally fatal within 
the first year of life, even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their 
nitrogen-free analogues. With haemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways 
(sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, 
and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in newborns diagnosed 
after birth (but within the first month of life) increased to almost 80% with most deaths occurring 
during an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy. Patients with neonatal-onset disease 
had a high incidence of mental retardation. 
In patients diagnosed during gestation and treated prior to any episode of hyperammonaemic 
encephalopathy, survival was 100%, but even in these patients, many subsequently demonstrated 
cognitive impairment or other neurologic deficits. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Phenylbutyrate is known to be oxidised to phenylacetate which is enzymatically conjugated with 
glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine in the liver and kidney. Phenylacetate is also hydrolysed 
by esterases in liver and blood. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Plasma and urine concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites have been obtained from 
fasting normal adults who received a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and from patients 
with urea cycle disorders, haemoglobinopathies and cirrhosis receiving single and repeated oral 
doses up to 20 g/day (uncontrolled studies). The disposition of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites 
has also been studied in cancer patients following intravenous infusion of sodium phenylbutyrate (up 
to 2 g/m²) or phenylacetate. 
Absorption 
Phenylbutyrate is rapidly absorbed under fasting conditions. Under fed conditions in the single-dose, 
open,  pharmacokinetic study (CPA 537-21), after a single oral dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, 
in the form of oral solution, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate were detected 10 minutes 
after dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 0.5 hour and the mean peak concentration 
150.44 μg/ml. The elimination half-life was estimated to be 0.63 hours. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of phenylbutyrate is 0.2 l/kg.  
Biotransformation 
After a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma 
levels of phenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine were detected 30 and 60 minutes respectively 
after dosing. The mean time to peak concentration was 3.55 and 3.23 hours, respectively, and the 
mean peak concentration was 45.3 and 62.8 μg/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life was 
estimated to be 1.3 and 2.4 hours, respectively. 
Studies with high intravenous doses of phenylacetate showed non-linear pharmacokinetics 
characterised by saturable metabolism to phenylacetylglutamine. Repeated dosing with 
phenylacetate showed evidence of an induction of clearance. 
In the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies receiving various doses 
of phenylbutyrate (300–650 mg/kg/day up to 20 g/day) no plasma level of phenylacetate could be 
detected after overnight fasting. In patients with impaired hepatic function the conversion of 
phenylacetate to phenylacetylglutamine may be relatively slower. Three cirrhotic patients (out of 6) 
who received repeated oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g/day in three doses) 
showed sustained plasma levels of phenylacetate on the third day that were five times higher than 
those achieved after the first dose. 
In normal volunteers gender differences were found in the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate (AUC and Cmax about 30–50% greater in females), but not 
phenylacetylglutamine. This may be due to the lipophilicity of sodium phenylbutyrate and 
consequent differences in volume of distribution. 
Excretion 
Approximately 80–100% of the medicinal product is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours as the 
conjugated product, phenylacetylglutamine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate (the active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) produced 
lesions in cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced 
in number (see section 4.6).  
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When high doses of phenylacetate (190 – 474 mg/kg) were given subcutaneously to rat pups, 
decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons were observed, as well as a reduction in CNS 
myelin. Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded and the number of functioning nerve terminals in 
the cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth. (see section 4.6). 
Sodium phenylbutyrate was negative in 2 mutagenicity tests, i.e. the Ames test and the micronucleus 
test. Results indicate that sodium phenylbutyrate did not induce any mutagenic effects in the Ames 
test with or without metabolic activation. Micronucleus test results indicate that sodium 
phenylbutyrate was considered not to have produced any clastogenic effect in rats treated at toxic or 
non-toxic dose levels (examined 24 and 48 hours after a single oral administration of 878 to 
2800 mg/kg). 
Carcinogenicity and fertility studies have not been conducted with sodium phenylbutyrate.

Package leaflet: Information for the patient 
PHEBURANE 483 mg/g granules 
Sodium phenylbutyrate 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
 
 
 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm 
them, even if their signs of illness are the same as yours. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible 
side effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4. 
 
What is in this leaflet: 
1. What PHEBURANE is and what it is used for 
2. What you need to know before you take PHEBURANE 
3. How to take PHEBURANE 
4. Possible side effects 
5. How to store PHEBURANE 
6. Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PHEBURANE is and what it is used for 
PHEBURANE contains the active substance sodium phenylbutyrate which is used to treat 
patients of all ages with urea cycle disorders. These rare disorders are due to a deficiency of 
certain liver enzymes which are necessary to eliminate waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia. 
Nitrogen is a building block of proteins, which are an essential part of the food we eat. As the 
body breaks down protein after eating, waste nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, accumulates 
because the body cannot eliminate it. Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in 
severe cases, to reduced levels of consciousness and to coma. 
This medicine helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen, reducing the amount of ammonia in 
your body. However PHEBURANE must be used along with a diet reduced in proteins, 
designed especially for you by the doctor and the dietician. You must follow this diet carefully. 
2.  What you need to know before you take PHEBURANE 
Do not take PHEBURANE if you: 
 
are allergic to sodium phenylbutyrate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
are pregnant. 
are breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PHEBURANE if you: 
 
suffer from congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump 
enough blood around the body) or a decrease in your kidney function. 
have decreased kidney or liver function, since PHEBURANE is eliminated from the body 
through the kidney and liver. 
 
 
 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PHEBURANE will not prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood, a 
condition which usually constitutes a medical emergency. If this happens you will develop 
symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), confusion and will need to get 
urgent medical help. 
If you need laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you are taking 
PHEBURANE, since sodium phenylbutyrate may interfere with certain laboratory test results 
(such as blood electrolytes or protein, or liver function tests) 
In case of any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Other medicines and PHEBURANE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing: 
 
 
 
 
valproate (an antiepileptic medicine). 
haloperidol (used in certain psychotic disorders). 
corticosteroids (medicines that are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body), 
probenecid (for treatment of hyperuricaemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood, 
associated with gout). 
These medicines may change the effect of PHEBURANE and you will need more frequent 
blood tests. If you are uncertain if your medicines contain these substances, you should check 
with your doctor or pharmacist. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use PHEBURANE if you are pregnant, because this medicine can harm your unborn 
baby.  
If you are a woman who could get pregnant, you must use reliable contraception, during 
treatment with PHEBURANE. Talk to your doctor for the details. 
Do not use PHEBURANE if you are breast-feeding, because this medicine can pass into the 
breast milk and may harm your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
PHEBURANE is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
PHEBURANE contains sodium and sucrose 
This medicine contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in

How to take PHEBURANE 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Dose 
The daily dose of PHEBURANE will be based on your body weight or body surface and 
adjusted according to your protein tolerance and diet. You will need regular blood tests to 
determine the correct daily dose. Your doctor will tell you the amount of granules you should 
take. 
Method of administration 
You should take PHEBURANE by mouth. Because it dissolves slowly, PHEBURANE should 
not be administered through a gastrostomy (tube that goes through the abdomen to the stomach) 
or through a nasogastric tube (tube that goes through the nose to the stomach). 
PHEBURANE must be taken with a special diet reduced in protein. 
You should take PHEBURANE with each meal or feeding. In small children this can be 4 to 6 
times per day. 
The doses of PHEBURANE prescribed by your doctor are expressed in grams of sodium 
phenylbutyrate. A calibrated measuring spoon which dispenses up to 3 g of sodium 
phenylbutyrate at a time is provided with the medicine. Only use this measuring spoon to 
measure out the dose of PHEBURANE. The measuring spoon must not be used for any other 
medicine. 
To measure the dose: 
 
Lines on the spoon indicate the amount of PHEBURANE in gram of sodium 
phenylbutyrate. Take the correct amount as prescribed by your doctor. 
Pour granules directly into the spoon as shown by the picture (on the outer carton and in 
this leaflet). 
Tap the spoon once on a table to give a horizontal level of granules and continue filling if 
necessary. 
 
 
The granules can be directly swallowed with a drink (water, fruit juices, protein-free infant 
formulas) or sprinkled on to a spoonful of solid foods (mashed potatoes or apple sauce). If you 
mix them with food, it is important that you take it immediately. This will keep the granules 
from producing any taste. 
You will need to take this medicine and to follow a diet throughout your life. 
If you take more PHEBURANE than you should 
Patients who have taken very high doses of sodium phenylbutyrate experienced: 
 
sleepiness, tiredness, light-headedness and less frequently confusion; 
 
headache; 
 
changes in taste (taste disturbances); 
 
decrease in hearing; 
 
disorientation; 
 
impaired memory; 
 
worsening of existing neurological conditions. 
If you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the 
nearest hospital emergency department for supportive treatment. 
If you forget to take PHEBURANE 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal. Make sure that there are at least 
3 hours between two doses. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What PHEBURANE is and what it is used for  
PHEBURANE contains the active substance sodium phenylbutyrate which is used to treat patients 
with urea cycle disorders. These rare disorders are due to a deficiency of certain liver enzymes which 
are necessary to eliminate waste nitrogen in the form of ammonia. 
Nitrogen is a building block of proteins, which are an essential part of the food we eat. As the body 
breaks down protein after eating, waste nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, accumulates because the 
body cannot eliminate it. Ammonia is especially toxic for the brain and leads, in severe cases, to 
reduced levels of consciousness and to coma. 
PHEBURANE helps the body to eliminate waste nitrogen, reducing the amount of ammonia in your 
body. However PHEBURANE oral solution must be used along with a diet reduced in proteins, 
designed especially for you by the doctor and the dietician. You must follow this diet carefully. 
2.  What you need to know before you take PHEBURANE 
Do not take PHEBURANE if you: 
 
are allergic to sodium phenylbutyrate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
are pregnant. 
are breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking PHEBURANE if you: 
 
suffer from congestive heart failure (a type of heart disease where the heart cannot pump 
enough blood around the body) or a decrease in your kidney function. 
have decreased kidney or liver function, since PHEBURANE oral solution is eliminated from 
the body through the kidney and liver. 
PHEBURANE  will not prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood, a 
condition which usually constitutes a medical emergency. If this happens you will develop 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms such as feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting), confusion and will need to get urgent 
medical help. 
If you need laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you are taking PHEBURANE 
oral solution, since sodium phenylbutyrate may interfere with certain laboratory test results (such as 
blood electrolytes or protein, or liver function tests) 
In case of any doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Other medicines and PHEBURANE 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
It is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking medicines containing: 
 
 
 
 
valproate (an antiepileptic medicine). 
haloperidol (used in certain psychotic disorders). 
corticosteroids (medicines that are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body), 
probenecid (for treatment of hyperuricaemia, high levels of uric acid in the blood, associated 
with gout). 
These medicines may change the effect of PHEBURANE and you will need more frequent blood 
tests. If you are uncertain if your medicines contain these substances, you should check with your 
doctor or pharmacist. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use PHEBURANE  if you are pregnant, because this medicine can harm your unborn baby.  
If you are a woman who could get pregnant, you must use reliable contraception, during 
treatment with PHEBURANE. Talk to your doctor for the details.

milk and may harm your baby. 
Driving and using machines 
PHEBURANE oral solution is unlikely to affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
PHEBURANE oral solution contains sodium  
This medicine contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each g 
dose of sodium phenylbutyrate. This is equivalent to 6.2% of the recommended maximum daily 
dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
The maximum daily dose of this medicine contains 2.5 g sodium This is equivalent to 125% of the 
recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you need 3 or more grams daily for a prolonged period, 
especially if you have been advised to follow a low salt (sodium) diet.  
PHEBURANE oral solution contains aspartame  
This medicine contains 5.7 mg of aspartame per g dose of sodium phenylbutyrate. Aspartame is a 
source of phenylalanine. It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic 
disorder in which phenylalanine builds up because the body cannot remove it properly. 
Blackcurrant flavour topping contains propylene glycol 
This medicine contains 26.55 mg of propylene glycol per drop. 
If your baby is less than 4 weeks old, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before giving them this 
medicine, in particular if the baby is given other medicines that contain propylene glycol or alcohol.

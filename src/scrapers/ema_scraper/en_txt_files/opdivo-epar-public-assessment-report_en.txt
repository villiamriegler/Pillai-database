2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanoma is the sixth and seventh most common 
malignancy in men and women, respectively.1 The median age at diagnosis is 59 years. The incidence of 
melanoma varies between different European countries but the estimated incidence was about 39.6 cases 
/100.000 men and 42.5 cases /100.000 women in 2012. In Europe in 2012, the mortality rate was 
approximately 8.8 cases/100.000 in males and 6.9 cases/100.000 in females.1 The outcome of melanoma 
depends on the stage at presentation2. Approximately 85% of patients with melanoma present with localised 
disease, 10% with regional disease and 5% with distant metastatic disease. The 5-year survival rates in patients 
who present with localised disease and primary tumours 1.0mm or less in thickness are very good, with more 
than 90% of patients surviving. The 5-year survival rates decrease as the tumour spreads: for tumours of more 
than 1.0mm in thickness, survival rates range from 50% to 90%, with  regional node involvement survival rates 
are around 50%, for within stage III (regional metastatic melanoma) 5-year survival rates range between 
20-70%, depending on primary nodal involvement. The long term survival for distant metastatic melanoma, the 
5-year survival is less than 10%. 
Current treatments for metastatic melanoma include systemic therapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Spontaneous 
regression of melanoma has been reported with an incidence of less than 1%. Complete resection of isolated 
metastases to one anatomic site (lung, gastrointestinal tract, bone or brain) may occasionally achieve long term 
survival. Systemic treatment may consist of chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is 
indicated for symptomatic relief of metastases to brain, bones and viscera. 
Chemotherapy with dacarbazine (DTIC) may achieve objective response rates of about 20%, of which less than 
5% is complete remission. Higher response rates have been seen using combination chemotherapy, however no 
increase in over-all survival has been demonstrated with combination regimens when compared to dacarbazine 
alone. Immunotherapeutic agents used for metastatic melanoma are interferon-alfa (IFNα) and interleukine-2 
(IL-2). Recurrent melanoma is resistant to most standard systemic therapy and no standardized effective 
second line treatment is established. 
In EU Countries, dacarbazine was used for many years as standard first line treatment of patients with 
metastatic melanoma3. Clinical trials with dacarbazine have shown low response rates ranging from 11% -25%, 
low rate of complete responses and of short duration (3 to 6 months). The median survival time ranged from 4.5 
to 6 months4,5,6. Ipilimumab (Yervoy), a human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4, was approved in the EU in 
2011 for melanoma patients who have received prior therapy. The approval of ipilimumab was based on the

results of a phase III study performed in previously treated melanoma patients was associated with a 
statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with the gp100 vaccine (10.1 versus 
6.4 months; HR: 0.66; p= 0.003). In recent times, the serine-threonine kinase BRAF was discovered mutated 
in many cancers7. BRAF mutations have been found in approximately 50% of melanoma, 30-70% of thyroid 
carcinomas, 30% of ovarian carcinoma and 10% of colorectal carcinoma. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF result in 
constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway which in turn stimulates cell growth, proliferation and cell 
survival in the absence of typical growth factors8. For patients with tumours harbouring the BRAFV600 mutation, 
kinase inhibitors vemurafenib (Zelborarf) and dabrafenib (Tafinlar) were approved in the EU in 2012 and 2013, 
respectively, and target directly the mutated protein BRAFV600. Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), as first line treatment 
was approved based on the results of the pivotal phase III study (BRIM3) and was associated with a median 
progression-free survival (PFS) 6.9 vs 1.6 months, respectively (HR 0.38, 95%CI: 0.32-0.46, p<0.0001) and  
median OS 13.6 vs 9.7 months (HR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, p<0.0001) compared with DTIC. Dabrafenib 
(Tafinlar), as first line therapy was approved based on the results of the pivotal trial BREAK-3 that showed a 
median PFS of 6.9 vs 2.7 months for the dabrafenib and DTIC group respectively, (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.24, 
0.58; p-value<0.0001) and OS (HR 0.76, 95%CI: 0.48, 1.21); a 12 month OS rate of 70 % and 63 % for 
dabrafenib and DTIC treatments, respectively). Trametinib (Mekinist) was approved in 2014 to target the 
mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK 1 and MEK 2) proteins to dampen the signalling 
pathway that promotes proliferation and survival in BRAFV600 mutated melanoma. Mekinist as first line of 
treatment was approved based on the results of a phase III study that showed a median PFS 4.8 vs 1.5 months, 
respectively (HR 0.45; 95%CI:0.33, 0.63; p-value <0.0001) and median OS of 15.6 vs 11.3 months (HR 0.78; 
95%CI 0.57, 1.06) for trametinib and dacarbazine respectively. 
The co-inhibitory receptor programmed cell death – 1 (PD-1) is a key regulator of T cell activity that belongs to 
the same immunoglobulin superfamily which includes the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and the co-inhibitory 
receptor CTLA-4.9, Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which 
binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The 
PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell 
immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, results in 
inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab potentiates T cell responses, including 
anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse 
models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour growth. 
The applicant applied for an accelerated procedure for the following indication: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adults.” 
The final approved indication was: 
“OPDIVO is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults.” 
Treatment must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
The recommended dose of OPDIVO is 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 weeks. 
Treatment should be continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by 
the patient.

Dose escalation or reduction is not recommended. Dosing delay or discontinuation may be required based on 
individual safety and tolerability. Guidelines for permanent discontinuation or withholding of doses are described 
in Table 1 of the SmPC. Detailed guidelines for the management of immune related adverse reactions are 
described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
OPDIVO is for intraveous use only. It is to be administered as an intravenous infusion over a period 
of 60 minutes. The infusion must be administered through a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein binding in-line 
filter with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 m.  
OPDIVO must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus injection. 
The total dose of OPDIVO required can be infused directly as a 10 mg/mL solution or can be diluted to as low 
as 1 mg/mL with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for 
injection.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody directed against the programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) receptor. It is an IgG4 consisting of four polypeptide chains; two identical heavy chains of 
440 amino acids and two identical kappa light chains of 214 amino acids, which are linked through inter-chain 
disulfide bonds. 
Nivolumab active substance is produced from large-scale cell culture using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
line and is purified using standard chromatography and filtration steps using a manufacturing process 
designated as Process C. Commercial nivolumab is manufactured by Lonza Biologics, Inc., Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, USA (Lonza-Portsmouth). Finished product from Process B active substance manufacturing process 
was used in pivotal clinical trials. Comparability of products manufactured from Process C to that manufactured 
from Process B was assessed by analytical comparability, product degradation profiles and in-process data 
comparability. Active substance is packaged in polyethylene bioprocess containers. Long-term stability studies 
support a 24-month shelf life for active substance when stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and protected from 
light. 
Opdivo injection is available as 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL) or 40 mg/4 mL (10 mg/mL) single-use 
presentations. Both presentations have the same protein concentration and are packaged in the same primary 
packaging which consists of a 10 mL, Type I flint glass tubing vial sealed with a 20mm grey butyl stopper and an 
aluminium flip-off seal. The only difference between the two presentations is the fill volume. Both presentations 
are packaged in a paperboard folded carton. Final release will occur at the Bristol Myers Squibb facility in Anagni, 
Italy (BMS-Anagni). The long-term stability data support a 24-month finished product shelf life when stored 
refrigerated (2°C to 8°C) and protected from light.

Nivolumab is manufactured in bioreactors. One production bioreactor leads to one bulk active substance lot. 
Bulk active substance lots are not combined at the active substance stage.  
Nivolumab is produced from manufacturing-scale cell culture using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that 
was transfected with an expression vector containing coding sequences for the heavy and light chains of the 
nivolumab IgG. A conventional two-tiered cell banking system is employed, consisting of a Master Cell Bank 
from which a Working Cell Bank (WCB) is derived.  
The upstream manufacturing process is a conventional fermentation process. Upstream processing starts with 
expansion of the WCB in a pre-culture step and a subsequent seed fermentation step. The expanded cells are 
transferred to a bioreactor and cultured under optimised conditions by means of a fed-batch process. Cell 
culture conditions and in-process controls (IPCs) have been sufficiently described. 
The downstream process comprises chromatography and viral inactivation/clearance steps. The concentrated 
clarified bulk from the primary recovery step is processed across a series of chromatography, viral inactivation, 
filtration, and ultrafiltration / diafiltration steps. The active substance is stored at 2ºC to 8ºC prior to shipping to 
the finished product manufacturing facility. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials used in the nivolumab commercial manufacturing process are controlled to ensure the quality and 
safety of the active substance and to maintain the consistency of the manufacturing process. Raw materials are 
purchased from qualified vendors. Raw material quality is assessed as defined in the testing specification for 
each raw material. 
Nivolumab production cells are CHO cells transfected with an expression vector containing the coding sequences 
for both heavy and light chains of the nivolumab IgG, in which the variable region genes were isolated from 
mouse hybridoma cells. The hybridoma cells were generated by the fusion of mouse myeloma cells with spleen 
cells from a PD-1 receptor immunised Human Ig transgenic mouse (HuMAb-Mouse) of the HCo7+KCo5 lineage. 
A hybridoma clone, 5C4.B8, which produced an anti-PD-1 antibody was selected. The immunoglobulin genes 
coding for the variable regions from the anti-PD-1 expressing hybridoma were cloned into an expression vector, 
which was used to establish CHO cell line expressing the nivolumab antibody. The cell line is used in the 
nivolumab manufacturing process at the Lonza Biologics facility Portsmouth (USA). 
The MCB is stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen in a cryofreezer designated for long-term storage of 
released cell banks. The nivolumab MCB is re-evaluated at 5 year intervals.  
The WCB was derived from a single vial of MCB. This WCB is stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen in a 
cryofreezer designated for long term storage of released cell banks. WCBs are tested for safety and productivity 
in accordance with regulatory guidelines and standard operating procedures before their release for 
manufacturing use. 
The limit of in vitro cell age for the nivolumab production cell line was determined through extended passages 
during the inoculum expansion and seed bioreactor steps for the nivolumab manufacturing process at 
manufacturing-scale during process performance qualification (PPQ). The results support the stability of the 
nivolumab production cell line have been suitably demonstrated with respect to biosafety, growth characteristics 
of the inoculum expansion and seed bioreactor steps, biochemical product quality assessment and genetic 
stability.

Process validation 
The process validation strategy for nivolumab active substance is based on a lifecycle management approach 
that includes the process design stage, PPQ stage, and ongoing (also referred to as continued) process 
verification stage.  
The nivolumab PPQ campaign qualified the media and buffer preparation, the upstream process, and the 
downstream process at Lonza Biologics, Portsmouth (USA). The PPQ protocols included prospectively defined 
acceptance criteria consisting of numerical limits for release testing results, (Critical) Process Parameters 
((C)PPs) and (Critical) Performance Attributes ((C)PAs) as defined in the IPC strategy presented. Acceptance 
criteria for the upstream manufacturing process and downstream manufacturing process were met. The 
acceptance criteria for PPQ described in the process validation section of the dossier reflect the IPC in place at 
the time the PPQ studies were conducted. After PPQ was completed, the IPC ranges and classifications were 
reviewed and compared to manufacturing-scale data and small-scale process characterisation data. Some 
ranges were amended and a number of (C)PPs and (C)PAs was reclassified. 
Control of critical steps 
An in-process control (IPC) strategy was defined for the nivolumab active substance manufacturing process. The 
IPC strategy is a planned set of controls derived from current product and process understanding that ensures 
consistent process performance and product quality. The controls include parameters and attributes related to 
active substance manufacturing to ensure the active substance meets the established specifications. The IPC 
strategy utilises a tiered set of in-process alert ranges, action ranges and critical ranges to ensure the consistent 
monitoring and control of the nivolumab active substance manufacturing process. The classification of IPC levels 
for each input and output is based upon an assessment of the potential impact of the parameter on the 
manufacturing process as well as the CQAs of the nivolumab active substance. Excursions from the established 
ranges are investigated for product quality impact. 
Manufacturing process development 
The development of the nivolumab manufacturing process in CHO cells started in 2006 and progressed during 
clinical development from manufacture of active substance by Process A, via Process B to Process C is currently 
the validated nivolumab manufacturing process at the Lonza Biologics facility, located in Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire and is intended for commercial manufacture. All pivotal clinical studies included in the submission 
have been performed using nivolumab from active substance Process B. 
The early development of the manufacturing process in conjunction with initial manufacturing scale experience 
was used to provide basic process understanding. Using the basic process understanding, upstream process 
characterisation was conducted to refine process understanding. Each unit operation of the manufacturing 
process was assessed to identify process parameters with a potential impact on critical quality attributes 
(CQAs). An upstream in-process control strategy was established to ensure that CQAs of the molecule were 
maintained within acceptable ranges.  
The upstream manufacturing Process C is identical to Process B for the majority of the steps. The development 
of the upstream manufacturing Process B is therefore directly applicable to Process C for these steps.  
The downstream manufacturing Process C was developed with a series of chromatographic steps. The 
downstream process also includes viral inactivation, viral filtration, and a UF/DF step which yields UFB. 
Polysorbate 80 is then added to UFB yielding the formulated bulk, which is subsequently filtered through a 
membrane ending in the final active substance. Process development activities have established several 
in-process control parameter ranges through a series of one-factor and multi-factor experiments. Development 
of process conditions was completed for each process step. Early development of the manufacturing process in 
conjunction with initial manufacturing scale experience provided basic process understanding. Process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 15/130 
 
  
  
characterisation was then conducted to refine process understanding and establish the downstream in-process 
control strategy. A scale-down model was completed for design of experiment (DoE) screening and 
statistically-designed response surface method (RSM) studies. The parameters that were demonstrated from 
development or screening studies to have a potential to impact product quality or process robustness were 
explored in RSM characterisation studies using the appropriate scale-down models. 
Comparability between Processes A, B and C 
Nivolumab manufacturing Process A was modified to accommodate scale-up and transfer to a new facility. The 
resulting process was designated Process B. Modifications to the upstream process were made to align with the 
manufacturing facility and to provide improved throughput while maintaining product quality. Comparability of 
active substance manufactured using Process A to that using Process B was established using biochemical 
comparability studies that included routine release and extended characterisation tests. The purification steps of 
Process B were modified to further increase process robustness and provide improved process control. The 
resulting process was designated as Process C.  
A comparison of the active substance release data from representative lots of Process A, Process B, and 
Process C was performed to confirm comparability of Process C active substance to Processes A and B active 
substance. Raw data and statistical analysis are presented. A comparison of the differences in mean responses 
for quantitative assays was performed between the Process B and Process C lots. The difference in means is 
calculated as the mean for Process C results minus the mean from the Process B results prior to rounding of the 
mean results. All individual Process C results fall within the Tolerance Limits (TL) of Processes A and B, and the 
intervals defined by the average ± 3 SD of the Process C data also fall within the TLs determined for Processes A 
and B. 
Identification of Critical Quality Attributes and classification of process parameters 
Potential CQAs were identified for product-related variants, process-related impurities and formulation related 
quality attributes. The available knowledge for each attribute, both specific to nivolumab and from relevant 
supporting class knowledge was compiled and then each attribute was assigned as critical or non-critical.  
An IPC strategy was established for the nivolumab active substance manufacturing process based on an 
integrated control strategy, which includes process control establishment and process control elements of each 
unit operation for quality attributes. Information is provided on the development of the strategy; the 
justifications for process parameter and performance attribute (PA) designations and their numerical ranges. 
The establishment of the IPC strategy for the nivolumab manufacturing process was based on toxicological 
assessments, process development, manufacturing-scale impurity mapping, stability testing, pilot-scale 
experience and manufacturing-scale experience to identify process control points for each quality attribute. 
Process development studies were designed to assess the influence of PPs on the quality of the active substance 
and the performance of the nivolumab manufacturing process. The results of these studies in combination with 
manufacturing experience were used to classify the process variables and establish IPC ranges for the upstream 
and downstream process steps. The IPC strategy process control elements for quality attributes include input 
material testing, in-process testing, PPs and specifications. Process control elements also include procedural 
controls for each unit operation. 
Characterisation 
Physical and biochemical properties of nivolumab were characterised using a series of orthogonal techniques, 
using all PPQ lots of nivolumab active substance. The techniques included liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the determination of primary structure; circular dichroism (CD) for determination 
of secondary structure; and other techniques for examination of higher order structure of nivolumab that 
included size exclusion chromatography (SEC), SEC-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), sodium dodecyl 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 16/130 
 
  
  
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary electrophoresis SDS (CE-SDS), and analytical 
ultracentrifugation (AUC) to characterize the size variants. Disulfide bonds were characterised by LC-MS. Protein 
conformation was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange 
mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). 
The biological properties of nivolumab were characterised using a direct binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA), binding competition ELISA (potency ELISA) and a cell-based bioassay. The binding kinetics of 
nivolumab to the PD-1 receptor was determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  
The interactions of the Fc region of the nivolumab molecule with human FcγRs (CD64, CD32 and CD16) and 
complement were assessed in both FcγR binding assays and in cellular cytotoxicity assays. The binding of 
nivolumab to the FcγRs was characterised by SPR. Nivolumab does not elicit measurable ADCC or CDC activity 
in vitro. Nivolumab has been shown to retain binding to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in SPR binding studies.  
Potential process related impurities in nivolumab have been identified and are controlled by in-process testing, 
release testing according to specifications and/or process performance qualification.  
Potential product-related impurities have been studied through the characterisation process and have been 
identified as High Molecular Weight (HMW) and Low Molecular Weight (LMW) species, which are controlled at 
release by SE-HPLC. 
Specification 
Nivolumab quality control testing for batch release includes appearance, quality, pH, purity, identity, potency, 
process-related impurities and endotoxins/bioburden. The specification set for nivolumab active substance are 
in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph on Monoclonal Antibodies for Human Use. 
The Applicant’s approach for selection of the release and shelf life tests is based on a multistep process including 
definition of CQAs, consideration of clinical experience, patient safety limits, stability of the active substance and 
finished product and process and method variability.  
The biological activity is tested in three assays, i.e., (1) by binding activity ELISA, (2) potency ELISA, and (3) a 
cell-based bioassay. Each of the three proposed assays measure a relevant biological effect of the product at 
different levels in its mechanism of action and are considered important for release. The three proposed 
biological activity release/shelf life tests are also stability indicating. 
Batch Analysis 
Batch (lot) information for nivolumab active substance including the process designation, site of manufacture, 
date of manufacture, batch size and designated use for each active substance batch is presented for all process 
A, B and C lots. All batch analysis data were in line with the acceptance criteria that applied at the time of testing. 
Reference standards of materials 
During development, a series of Research Reference Standards (RRSs) was used. The initial reference standard 
was established as the reference standard prior to PPQ, and will serve as the initial Working Reference Standard 
(WRS) for release and stability testing of commercial lots. 
BMS plans to implement a two-tiered reference standard strategy, at which time the existing reference standard 
will become the Primary Reference Standard (PRS) and will be used to qualify future Working Reference 
Standards. The existing reference standard was prepared using Process B active substance; finished product 
manufactured from this lot was used in pivotal clinical trials for lung cancer and melanoma and thus provides a 
direct link to clinical experience. 
Container closure system 
Assessment report

Active substance is filled into single-use, pre-sterilised multi-layered low density polyethylene (LDPE) 
bioprocess containers. Bioprocess containers are made from virgin plastics specifically manufactured from 
non-recycled material for use by pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers. 
No semi-volatile organic compounds and non-volatile organic compounds were detected. Several metal ions 
were detected but all were below ppm levels and therefore not reported. Leachables studies were performed by 
storing the bags under two real-time and accelerated conditions. Leachables identified from nivolumab active 
substance or formulation buffer were evaluated in a toxicological review in which the estimated maximum daily 
exposure was compared to the permissible daily exposure (PDE) for each leachable. Results indicated that no 
leachable compounds are anticipated to pose a safety risk when nivolumab is administered as directed. 
Stability 
Stability studies have been conducted on batches of nivolumab active substance in accordance with ICH stability 
guidelines and demonstrate that the active substance is stable for up to 24 months when stored at 2C to 8C. 
Some of the batches were manufactured according to Process C and three according to Process B. Active 
substance manufactured according to Process C was shown to be comparable to active substance manufactured 
according to Process B. While in the first submission only the batches manufactured according to Process B had 
stability data for 24 months, in the Applicant’s responses new data up to 24 months was also submitted for the 
batches manufactured according to Process C. Stability data were evaluated according to the specification as 
provided. The specification evolved during the execution of the stability studies. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Two commercial presentations, Opdivo injection, 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg/mL) and Opdivo injection, 40 mg/4 mL 
(10 mg/mL) have been developed. Both presentations have the same protein concentration and are packaged 
in the same primary packaging which consists of a 10 mL, Type I flint glass tubing vial and sealed with a 20mm 
butyl stopper and an aluminium, flip-off seal. The only difference between the two presentations is the fill 
volume. Both presentations are packaged in a paperboard folded carton.  
The formulation contains sodium citrate as buffering agent, sodium chloride and mannitol as tonicity modifier, 
pentetic acid as metal ion chelator, polysorbate 80 as surfactant, hydrochloric acid/sodium hydroxide for pH 
adjustment and water for injection as solvent. Choice and concentrations of the excipients and the pH of the 
formulation were adequately justified by formulation studies. In addition, the robustness of the formulation was 
studied for slight variations in pH, and concentrations of citrate buffer, sodium chloride, mannitol and pentetic 
acid with satisfactory results. An overfill is included in each vial to account for loss in the vial. 
Opdivo injection is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale yellow liquid which may contain light (few) 
particulates. The finished product is a sterile, non-pyrogenic, single-use, preservative-free, isotonic aqueous 
solution for intravenous (IV) administration. Opdivo injection may be administered undiluted at a concentration 
of 10 mg/mL or further diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution 
for injection) or 5% dextrose injection (50 mg/mL (5%) glucose solution for injection) to nivolumab 
concentrations as low as 1 mg/mL. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the 100/10 ml and 40 mg/ml vials is straightforward and was described in 
sufficient detail. Briefly, buffer solution is prepared and the active substance is diluted with filtered buffer in two 
steps, followed by sterile filtration, filling and finishing. Appropriate in-process tests are performed with limits 
that ensure that the product will meet the corresponding finished product specifications. Hold times were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 18/130 
 
  
  
justified by validation studies performed during process development and were confirmed during process 
performance qualification. 
During development no major changes were introduced in the formulation, manufacturing process or container 
closure system of the finished product. Only early clinical studies (phase 1) were performed with a formulation 
that contained lower amount of polysorbate 80 and a direct fill and finishing procedure. The change in active 
substance manufacturing process from Process B to C is discussed in the active substance section. 
Product specification 
Finished product release testing includes general quality tests, composition, identity, purity, potency, total 
protein, and microbial test (sterility, bacterial endotoxin, container closure integrity test). Many test procedures 
and specifications are the same or similar to those for the active substance. 
The finished product may contain low levels of visible particles. For administration of Opdivo, an infusion set with 
an in-line low protein binding filter will be used. Satisfactory finished product batch analysis data of Process A 
batches, Process B batches and Process C batches were provided. The data show, overall, that the process is 
running consistently. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 24 months at 2°C to 8°C is proposed for both presentations. Stability studies were appropriately 
designed. For the 100 mg/10 ml long term stability data were provided for Process B and Process C batches. For 
the 40 mg/4 ml presentation long term stability data were provided. The information provided in the Applicant’s 
responses contains data for at least 24 months in all the above 100 mg/10 ml batches and for 15 months in 40 
mg/4 ml batches. 
Adventitious agents 
No raw material of animal origin (primary source) was used in the manufacture and cryopreservation of the 
Research Cell bank, MCB and WCB for nivolumab. The nivolumab active substance manufacturing process does 
not use any material of animal or human origin. 
Viral clearance is achieved through viral inactivation, physical removal of virus by nanofiltration and three 
orthogonal chromatographic steps. Low-pH viral inactivation and virus removal filtration are the dedicated viral 
clearance steps. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The overall standard of the Module 3 Quality dossier presented in support of this application is high, with the 
description of the manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product in general containing 
sufficient detail to permit an in-depth assessment of the marketing authorisation application.  
Active substance 
Manufacture 
The nivolumab active substance manufacturing process was described in sufficient detail. The virus filtration 
(VF) and final filtration and fill steps may be reprocessed when, for example, the viral filter post-use integrity 
test fails or if processing is not performed as intended. The reprocessing steps were sufficiently described and 
were properly validated.  
Information provided on control and compositions of media, buffers, solvents, reagents and auxiliary substances 
used in the manufacturing process of nivolumab was considered acceptable. Control of materials mainly relies 
on suppliers’ certificates of analysis. Specifications were set and provided for the raw materials used in the 
fermentation process, harvesting and purification steps, as well as for the column materials. The information on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 19/130 
 
  
  
materials from biological origin was sufficiently detailed. Certificates of analysis and, where available, EDQM 
CEPs were provided. The data provided did not give rise to safety concerns as regards viral and/or TSE issues. 
The nivolumab active substance manufacturing process starting from WCB does not use any material of animal 
or human origin. A number of other concerns were identified regarding the raw materials and the control of the 
cell banks and were appropriately addressed by the Applicant. 
The establishment and genealogy of the CHO cell line and the construction of the nivolumab expression vector 
used in the nivolumab manufacturing process at the Lonza Biologics facility were described in sufficient detail. 
According to the information provided in the initial submission, it was concluded that the cell banks were fully 
characterised, including at the limit of in vitro age, to evaluate their ability to consistently produce nivolumab 
active substance. A cell bank stability program was in place for ongoing monitoring.  
Taken into consideration all information provided, it was considered that the quality of the active substance is 
consistently maintained at the Lonza facility. Manufacturing process changes were made during development 
from Process A through Process B to Process C. An extensive comparability program was performed to 
demonstrate comparable product quality. The lot numbers mentioned and the results from the analytical 
comparability testing suggest that a limited number of batches from Process A and from Process B were tested 
to establish comparability of these processes, which is generally not deemed sufficient to draw a sound 
conclusion on comparability of Process A and Process B. However, the level of comparability between Process A 
and Process B manufactured active substance is deemed of minor importance in demonstrating comparability of 
Process B (i.e. process used for pivotal clinical trial material) and Process C (i.e. intended commercial process) 
manufactured active substance. Therefore, requesting more information was considered of limited value. 
An extensive data package was provided to demonstrate comparability of the active substance manufactured by 
Process B and Process C. Only minor differences were detected between active substance lots from Process B 
versus Process C lots. These differences were sufficiently discussed and are not expected to have a negative 
impact on the quality of the product. In summary, based on the comparison of the release testing data provided 
and further supported by a data set on extended characterisation and forced degradation, it could be concluded 
that active substance manufactured using Process C (commercial process) is comparable to active substance 
manufactured using Process B used in pivotal clinical trials. 
Process validation 
Process verification was based on the manufacture of multiple PPQ lots. At each step, all (Critical) Process 
Parameters ((C)PPs) and (Critical) Performance Attributes ((C)PAs) that were identified during upstream and 
downstream process parameter designation were monitored c.q. analysed. Sufficient actual numerical data 
were given for process controls, results of in-process testing and yields of the different steps. All PPQ lots passed 
release testing and met the acceptance criteria in place at the time of the PPQ. 
Intentional reprocessing was performed to demonstrate that reprocessing of nivolumab through the VF and final 
filtration and fill steps does not impact the quality of the in-process material or the resulting active substance at 
release. Both the post-VF pool and the filtrated and filled nivolumab active substance met the acceptance criteria 
after reprocessing. 
Several deviations against the PPQ protocol acceptance criteria occurred. The way these deviations were 
investigated and handled was sufficiently described. The impact of each deviation on the production 
process/product quality was discussed. All deviations appeared to be related to operational or technical errors 
(equipment) and did not influence CPPs or CPAs and thus did not affect any critical quality attribute (CQA). 
Deviations during process verification were sufficiently addressed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 20/130 
 
  
  
Overall, the results of the validation lots were very consistent and confirmed that the final manufacturing 
process performs effectively and is able to produce nivolumab intermediates and active substance meeting their 
predetermined acceptance criteria, on an appropriate number of consecutive batches on commercial scale when 
operating within the Proven Acceptable Ranges.  
The impact of the hold times and conditions on the product quality were appropriately evaluated. The maximum 
hold time for each process intermediate was justified based on analysis of an appropriate set of stability 
indicating assays and parameters, including a number of relevant performance attributes (HMW, degradation, 
bioburden, endotoxins, binding ELISA). The maximum hold times are considered adequate. 
After PPQ was completed, the in-process control (IPC) ranges and classifications were reviewed and compared 
to manufacturing-scale data and small-scale process characterisation data. An overview of all adjusted IPC 
ranges was presented and each adjustment was justified. Furthermore, a number of process variables were 
upgraded to CPP. 
The completed studies defined in the PPQ protocols demonstrated the effective and consistent production of 
nivolumab active substance. The upstream and downstream steps of the manufacturing process used to 
produce nivolumab active substance are considered qualified. 
Control of critical steps / Control strategy 
The manufacturing process development is based on an enhanced approach using several QbD elements, such 
as the use of available knowledge for each quality attribute, risk assessments to assign the criticality of quality 
attributes, Design of Experiments (DoE) studies to assign the criticality of process parameters and finally to 
define an integrated control strategy. It is noted that no Design Space is claimed. 
Overall, the approach was deemed appropriate, and as requested the Applicant defined potency as an active 
substance CQA in line with the approach taken for the finished product. Extensive information was provided in 
support of the assigned process parameters and performance attributes based on an in-depth evaluation of each 
operation unit in terms of process parameter variability and impact on quality attributes. Process parameters 
and performance attributes and respective alert/actions limits were sufficiently supported by process 
characterisation studies. 
Excursions from established alert, action or critical ranges were investigated to evaluate the possible root cause 
and possible impact on product quality. The Applicant justified that the investigation of these excursions entails 
sufficient rigour to ensure that the quality of the product is unaffected. 
Multiple levels of control were established throughout the nivolumab manufacturing process to minimise the risk 
of contamination of the finished product with adventitious viruses. Cell banks were extensively tested for 
adventitious as well as endogenous agents. Cell culture is performed under serum free conditions using media 
that contain no components of animal or human origin. Pre-harvest samples from each nivolumab production 
batch are tested for bioburden, endotoxin, mycoplasma, in vitro adventitious agents and minute virus of mice. 
Five process steps were investigated in virus validation studies to determine the manufacturing process capacity 
for virus inactivation/removal.  In general, the strategy for virus validation was considered acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Overall, the analytical methods applied for characterisation of nivolumab were considered adequate and provide 
a complete characterisation of the molecule. The analytical methods applied were described in sufficient detail. 
Control of active substance 
The Applicant’s approach for selection of the release and shelf life tests is based on a multistep process including 
definition of CQAs, consideration of clinical experience, patient safety limits, stability of the active substance and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 21/130 
 
  
  
finished product and process and method variability. The approach is adequately documented in the application 
and is generally acceptable. 
Specifications for the biological assays were also tightened, as requested during the procedure. 
Discontinuation of the tests for impurities was based on consistent low results at the level of unformulated bulk 
active substance, often at or below the quantitation limit, in-process testing during process qualification, spiking 
studies at small scale and safety assessment. The results of the analysis of these studies indeed warrant 
discontinuation of these tests. The test for residual host-cell protein will be continued at the level of the 
unformulated active substance, which is endorsed. The Applicant agreed to develop and implement a 
process-specific HCP method, which should be available by the end of March 2016. 
Analytical methods applied for batch release and stability testing were described in sufficient detail. Appropriate 
controls and relevant parameters ensuring the validity of the test were included. Methods were adequately 
validated and are suitable for their purpose.  
Satisfactory active substance batch analysis data of have been provided. The data show, overall, that the 
process is running consistently. 
Reference standards of materials 
Adequate information was provided for reference standards. The current reference standard was prepared using 
Process B active substance; finished product manufactured from this lot was used in pivotal clinical trials for lung 
cancer and melanoma and thus provides a direct link to clinical experience. The Applicant plans to implement a 
two-tiered reference standard strategy, at which time the current Reference Standard will become the Primary 
Reference Standard (PRS) and will be used to qualify future Working Reference Standards. 
Active substance stability 
Since the active substance manufactured by Process C was shown to be comparable to active substance 
processed by Process B, the stability data available for Process B batches were regarded representative and 
could be considered supportive for the proposed active substance storage time of 24 months. In any case, 
updated finished product stability data was provided in the Applicant’s responses supporting the acceptability of 
the proposed finished product shelf life of 24 months when stored at 2-8ºC and protected from light. The 
Applicant satisfactorily addressed a number of concerns raised about the analytical methods and the proposed 
active substance (release and) end-of-shelf-life specifications, with in some cases commitments. 
Finished product 
The manufacture of the finished product is a straightforward aseptic filling process for a liquid formulation. 
Satisfactory information with regard to manufacturing process development was provided. 
Whilst the control strategy (i.e. the type and number of controls) was generally considered acceptable, a 
number of concerns was identified. The process to assign a criticality status to process parameters and controls 
was not sufficiently described for a number of parameters and some relevant parameters were lacking. These 
issues were considered resolved following the submission of the Applicant’s responses. 
The Applicant’s approach for selection of the release and shelf life tests is based on a multi-step process 
including definition of critical quality attributes (CQAs), consideration of clinical experience, patient safety limits, 
stability of the active substance and finished product and process and method variability. The approach was 
adequately documented in the application and was generally acceptable.  
The compatibility of the finished product with the container closure system was sufficiently studied. 
Compatibility was established for the recommended final infusion concentration range, diluents, containers, IV 
administration sets, in-line filters (0.2 and 1.2 µm polyethersulfone membranes) and infusion flow rates. An 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015

appropriate matrix design was used. The leachables studies did not give rise to any concerns. Given the 
relatively high concentration of citrate in the finished product, glass delamination was investigated with three 
compatibility studies and no risk of delamination was found. 
Updated finished product stability data were provided in the Applicant’s responses supporting the acceptability 
of the proposed finished product shelf life of 24 months at 2-8 °C and protected from light for both 
presentations. 
Adventitious agents 
The risk of TSE is considered very low in the nivolumab manufacturing process. 
Viral elimination/inactivation studies were validated, but only a summary of the results was presented. The 
Applicant was asked to provide the full reports plus some other minor clarifications. All information submitted in

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacology of PD-1 blockade was evaluated in vitro using primarily human and murine cells and in vivo in 
mice using a murine homolog product. Safety of nivolumab was evaluated exclusively in nonhuman primates, 
the only relevant and pharmacologically responsive model. 
The pivotal toxicology studies supporting the safety of nivolumab were conducted in compliance with Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations.

Nivolumab binding to PD-1 on T cells and its affinity to human and cynomolgus PD-1 was assessed using surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR). Recombinant PD-1-Ig fusion protein was coated on a substrate chip and several 
concentrations of the antibody were flowed over the chip to obtain binding and dissociation kinetics.  The results 
are shown in Table 5.  
Table 5: 
Affinities of nivolumab by surface plasmon resonance 
PD-1 epitope sequence (BDX-1106-321 930072902) 
Physical binding experiments were performed by immunoprecipitation with either intact PD-1 or PD-1 peptides 
generated from various enzymatic digests. As shown in the figure below, three peptides were identified, 1a 
(62-69), 1b (70-86) and 2 (118-136). Peptides 1a and 1b are adjacent to one another in the linear sequence of 
PD-1. Peptide 1a was found to have the strongest affinity to nivolumab. The binding of nivolumab to antigen was 
found to be dependent upon glycosylation of PD-1. 
Figure 3: 
Amino acids 1-150 of human PD-1, peptide sequences precipitated by nivolumab 
are underlined 
The cynomolgus amino acid sequence is highly homologous to human PD-1 and within the peptides 1a, 1b and 
2, all but one amino acid are identical. 
Binding of nivolumab to recombinant human PD-1 and related proteins (MDX-1106-025-R 930046580 and 
amendments) 
The ability of nivolumab to bind recombinant human PD-1-Ig fusion protein was demonstrated by ELISA. The 
results show an EC50 = 0.39 nM while demonstrating no binding to select other members of the related 
immunoglobulin supergene family i.e. CD28, ICOS, CTLA-4 and BTLA.

Binding of nivolumab to activated human peripheral T cells (MDX-1106-025-R 930046580 and amendments) 
To confirm binding of nivolumab to native PD-1, activated human peripheral T cells which upregulate PD-1 on 
the cell surface were used to test binding of nivolumab by flow cytometry. Nivolumab binds to native PD-1 
molecules expressed on activated T cells with an EC50 of 0.64 nM. No binding of the isotype control IgG4 
antibody was observed. Notably, no binding of nivolumab was detected to activated rat or rabbit T cells. 
Functional activity of nivolumab in vitro  
Studies were undertaken to establish that nivolumab can inhibit binding between PD-1 and ligands PD-L1 and 
PD-L2. In vitro assays were performed for MLR, tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cell restimulations and viral 
antigen-specific responses to evaluate the functional effect of nivolumab. 
  Activity of nivolumab in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MDX-1106-026R 930046581): The effect of 
PD-1 blockade by nivolumab on the immune response was studied using the MLR in which CD4+ T cells 
recognize allogeneic monocyte-derived dendritic cells and results in T cell proliferation and cytokine 
secretion. Results are shown in Figure 5.

  Nivolumab enhances an antigen-specific recall response in vitro (MDX-1106-042R 930046579 and 
amendments): The effect of nivolumab on an antigen-specific CD4+ T cell recall response was 
investigated using the response of human PBMC to a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-restimulation as assessed 
by secretion of IFN-γ. Nivolumab augmented IFN-γ secretion in response to stimulation by CMV antigen 
in a dose-dependent manner EC50 = 0.001 to 0.018 μg/mL (0.0067-0.12 nM). Maximum IFN-γ 
secretion was 2.5 to 5.3-fold more than CMV lysate stimulation alone.  
 
PD-1 blockade and activation of HCV-specific T cells (MDX-1106-228R 930049318): The effect of PD-1 
blockade on the ability of HCV-specific CD8+ T cells to produce the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α was 
measured using an intracellular cytokine stain (ICS). HCV-seropositive donor PBMCs were cultured in 
vitro with HCV-specific peptide (4H) and nivolumab or hIgG4 isotype antibody for 6 days. The PBMCs 
were harvested and restimulated with HCV-specific peptide and assayed for cytokines in the CD8+ T cell 
subset using flow cytometry. The results shown in Figure 6.

cytotoxic T cells.10  
In vitro activity of nivolumab in assays of antibody effector function 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (BDX-1106-320 930073399) 
An antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay using IL-2 activated PBMC was conducted to 
evaluate whether nivolumab could induce ADCC of target cells. Among four donors, nivolumab did not mediate 
ADCC of activated human PD-1+ CD4+ T cells at most concentrations with only minor lytic activity at high 
concentrations. The mean values of percentage of cell lysis for nivolumab were 3.6 and 1.2% at 12.5 and 50 
μg/mL, whereas for the positive control anti-HLA-1 antibody (HLA1 IgG1) the cell lysis were 33.8 and 26.1% at 
the same concentrations.

Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of nivolumab was examined using activated human PD-1+ CD4+ T 
cells. CDC studies demonstrated that, at concentrations up to 50 µg/mL, nivolumab did not elicit cytotoxicity of 
PD-1-expressing activated human CD4+ T.cells.

Effects of PD-1 blockade in tumour models (MDX-1106-028R 930046578) 
The efficacy of PD-1 blockade on the growth of transplantable tumours in mice was tested. As nivolumab does 
not recognize mouse PD-1, a surrogate anti-mouse PD-1 antibody (clone 4H2; mouse IgG1 isotype) was derived 
and shown to bind to cells expressing murine PD-1 (EC50 = 2.9 nM) and block binding of mouse PD-L1 and 
PD-L2 to mouse PD-1, with an EC50 for blocking of 3.6 and 4.9 nM, respectively. The effects of 4H2 anti-PD-1 
antibody blockade were tested in the following murine syngeneic tumor models: MC38 colon carcinoma, SA1/N 
fibrosarcoma, J558 melanoma, Renca kidney model, B16F10 melanoma, 4T1breast carcinoma, and CT26 colon 
carcinoma. The results are summarised in Table 6.

Table 6: 
Summary of key findings in in vivo studies with different tumour models 
The administration of anti-mouse PD-1 antibody 4H2 resulted in delayed tumor progression in the MC38, Sa1N, 
and J558 models, with complete tumor regressions observed in some individual mice in these studies. In these 
models, PD-1 blockade delivered at the time of tumor implantation (prophylactic or unstaged) or after tumors 
were established (therapeutic or staged) delayed or prevented the outgrowth of tumors. Four other syngeneic 
tumor models (Renca, 4T1, CT26, and B16F10) were refractory to anti-PD-1 treatment. In the Renca and 4T1 
models, the prophylactic administration of an anti-PD-1 mAb did not impact tumor growth, and growth rates 
were nearly identical between the 4H2-treated and control groups. In the therapeutic B16F10 and CT26 models, 
the tumors grew very aggressively and 4H2 failed to significantly reduce the growth rate of established tumors. 
MC38 model in C57BL/6 mice (MDX-1106-023R 930046542, MDX-1106-032R 930046566) 
MC38 cells are colon adenocarcinoma cells derived from C57BL/6 mice that express PD-L1 in vivo, although in 
vitro expression of PD-L1 is very low.  Two in vivo studies with MC38 tumours were conducted in mice. In both 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015

studies mice were transplanted with an unstaged MC38 tumour (subcutaneous implantation of 2 million cells) 
and treated with control IgG or anti-PD-1 antibody 4H2 (nivolumab murine surrogate) at 10 mg/kg IP. In the 
first study each animal received the first antibody or control dose the same day of the tumour implantation, and 
additional doses on days 3 and 6 post-implantation. At day 21, 83% tumour growth inhibition was observed, 
with 30% of mice tumour-free at the study endpoint. In the other study, treatment with control IgG or anti-PD-1 
antibody 4H2 was conducted on days 7 post-tumour implantation and again on days 10 and 13, resulting in a 
mean tumour growth inhibition of 62% at day 13 and a median growth inhibition of 76% by day 20. 
Dose titration of anti-PD-1 antibody in the MC38 model (MDX-1106-200R 930046571) 
A dose titration was performed with anti-PD-1 antibody to determine whether there is a relationship between 
dose and efficacy in a staged MC38 tumour model. With dosing on days 6, 10 and 13 post-implantation, 
antitumor responses were most potent at 30 mg/kg and little difference was observed between animals treated 
with 3 and 10 mg/kg/dose. Results are shown in table 7.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The applicant did not submit secondary pharmacodynamic studies (see non-clinical discussion).  
Safety pharmacology programme 
In the single-dose cardiovascular safety study, groups of 6 telemetered Cynomolgus monkeys (3 per sex) were 
administered 0 (vehicle control), 10, or 50 mg/kg nivolumab intravenously. Both were well tolerated and there 
were no nivolumab-related effects on clinical signs, body weights, cardiovascular parameters, or body 
temperature. In repeat-dose toxicity studies, weekly (QW) or 2QW IV doses of nivolumab were administered for 
1 or 3 months, respectively, at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg. No nivolumab-related clinical signs of toxicity or 
effects on body weight, food consumption, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, or ophthalmic or 
electrocardiographic parameters were observed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The  pharmacodynamics  activity  of  nivolumab  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  was  evaluated  in  combination  with 
anti-CTLA (ipilimumab) and anti-LAG-3 (BMS-986016) monoclonal antibodies.  
Combination study of nivolumab and ipilimumab (SUV00106 930036346) 
The pharmacodynamic activity of nivolumab when administered in combination with ipilimumab was studied in 
a 1-month combination study in cynomolgus monkeys which included an assessment of the Immune function 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015

was evaluated by measurement of antibody response to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) (study SUV00106). 
Immunophenotypic analyses of peripheral blood were conducted at different intervals to identify changes in the 
composition of immune cells. This study included 5 animals/sex/group treated at 3 mg/kg ipilimumab and 10 
mg/kg nivolumab or 10 mg/kg ipilimumab and 50 mg/kg nivolumab infused IV once weekly for 4 consecutive 
weeks.  
The high dose combination showed variable but significant increases in the number and frequency of peripheral 
blood CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells on day 7, whereas no changes were observed in the number or 
frequency of monocytes or natural killer cells. Similar changes were observed in the 3-month toxicity study with 
nivolumab alone (study WIL-552003). In addition, an increased incidence of immune-mediated adverse effects 
(GI toxicity/colitis) was also observed in this combination study, which was consistent with the observed 
potentially enhanced T cell numbers and activity.  
Combination study of nivolumab and BMS-986016 (DN12123 930070016) 
In a 1-month combination study, nivolumab (50 mg/kg) or BMS-986016 alone (30 and 100 mg/kg) and in 
combination (50 mg/kg nivolumab and 100 mg/kg BMS-986016) were administered to monkeys (5/group/sex) 
for a total of 5 weekly doses. Serum nivolumab exposures when administered in combination with BMS-986016 
were comparable to exposures observed when nivolumab was administered alone. There were no 
nivolumab-related changes in T-cell dependent antibody responses to KLH and hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg), ex vivo recall responses to KLH in CD8+CD4- T cells or HBsAg in CD4+CD8+ or CD8+CD4- T cells. 
However, nivolumab alone and in combination with BMS-986016 caused increases in immune cell parameters, 
consistent with pharmacological mechanisms of action of nivolumab and BMS-986016. In both cases, cytokine 
production was greater in the combination group than in the monotherapy groups.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The cynomolgus monkey was determined to be a relevant animal species because nivolumab binds to 
cynomolgus monkey PD-1 receptor. Therefore, all pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys. Since the intended route of administration in patients is intravenous, nivolumab was administered IV 
in all nonclinical studies as a solution in 20 nM sodium citrate, 50 nM sodium chloride, 20 μM diethylenetriamine 
pentacetic acid (DTPA), 3% mannitol, 0.01% polysorbate 80 (pH 6). This was similar to the clinical formulation.

In study SUV00027, consistent with the long t½, total serum clearance (CLT) was low (0.172-0.250 mL/h/kg), 
with slightly more rapid clearance after 1 mg/kg doses than after the 10 mg/kg doses in males. The volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) was low, with values of 0.046-0.06 L/kg at all doses. For study SUV00025, 
consistent with the long t½, CTLs were 0.266-0.323 mL/h/kg at 1 mg/kg and 0.161-0.222 mL/h/kg at higher 
doses.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicity studies of nivolumab were performed in a battery of nonGLP studies, and GLP- and 
ICH-compliant in vitro tissue binding studies in multiple species and in vivo toxicology studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
Single dose toxicity 
A single-dose IV of nivolumab at dose levels of 1 or 10 mg/kg was administered in cynomolgus monkeys.

In the 1-month toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, 5 weekly IV doses of nivolumab were administered at 
dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 1, 10, or 50 mg/kg. There were no nivolumab-related clinical signs or changes 
in body weight; food consumption; blood pressure; heart and respiration rates; ophthalmic or 
electrocardiographic parameters; clinical pathology parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, 
thyroid hormone, urinalysis, or urine chemistry); or gross or microscopic pathology findings. In addition, there 
were no nivolumab-related changes in immune cell parameters. 
In the 3-month toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, IV doses of nivolumab were administered 2QW (for a 
total of 27 doses) at dose levels of 0 (vehicle control), 10, or 50 mg/kg. There were no nivolumab related effects 
on body weight, cardiovascular, neurologic, respiratory, ophthalmic, urinalysis, hematologic, or organ weight 
parameters, and no gross or microscopic pathology findings. 
Genotoxicity

Reproduction Toxicity 
In the ePPND study, nivolumab was administered 2QW at 10 or 50 mg/kg to pregnant monkeys from GD 20 to 
22 until parturition. Nivolumab was well tolerated at both doses and there were no nivolumab-related effects on 
viability,  clinical  signs,  food  consumption,  body  weights,  immunological  endpoints,  or  clinical/anatomic 
pathology parameters in these females throughout the study. However, in the offspring, maternal nivolumab 
administration at both doses was associated with fetal/neonatal mortality characterized by: 1) dose-dependent 
increases in third trimester fetal losses (12.5% and 33.3% at 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, relative to 7.1% 
in controls), which occurred predominately after GD 120; and 2) increased neonatal mortality at 10 mg/kg, 
which was noted in 3 infants with extreme prematurity during the first 2 postnatal weeks. The cause(s) of these 
fetal  losses  and  infant  prematurity  could  not  be  determined.  The  remaining  offspring  of  nivolumab-treated 
females  survived  to  scheduled  termination  and  there  were  no  nivolumab-related  effects  on  any  of  the 
parameters evaluated throughout the 6-month postnatal period.

Local Tolerance  
The local tolerance of nivolumab was assessed in single- and repeat-dose IV studies (QW, 2QW, and monthly) 
in monkeys. Nivolumab was administered at up to 50 mg/kg/dose. No irritation or local tolerance issues were 
observed.

Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity 
Nivolumab was immunogenic in study SUV00027, with 5 of 6 animals at 1 mg/kg and 2 of 3 animals at 10 mg/kg 
tested positive for anti-drug antibodies 27 days after dosing. There was no apparent effect of these antibodies 
on the PK of nivolumab. 
Nivolumab binds cynomolgus monkey PD-1 and human PD-1 with similar affinities (KD of 3.06 nM to human 
PD-1 and 3.92 nM to cynomolgus monkey PD-1), and exhibits pharmacologic activity in humans and monkeys, 
but nivolumab does not bind homologous PD-1 in other traditional toxicology species (eg, rat, rabbit). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant risk to the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk 
Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The similarities in tissue binding profiles between cynomolgus monkeys and humans indicate that the 
cynomolgus monkey was an appropriate animal model for preclinical toxicity testing of nivolumab. In contrast, 
cross-reactivity studies conducted with rat and rabbit PD-1 showed no binding.  
The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion. This is acceptable as in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6), no tissues 
distribution studies, metabolism studies, mass balance are considered necessary. The single-dose PK of 
nivolumab in cynomolgus monkeys were characterized by a long t½, a low CLTs and a low distribution volume 
at the steady state (Vss) which are characteristics for a mAb. The metabolism and clearance of nivolumab in vivo 
is expected to follow the degradation route of Abs in general, via biochemical pathways that are independent of 
metabolising enzymes. Formal distribution studies with nivolumab were not conducted. The low volume of 
distribution ranging between 0.046-0.071 L/kg at steady state suggests that most of the monoclonal antibody 
remains in the bloodstream. While there was no accumulation of the mAb at 10mg/kg/month, accumulation was 
apparent at 1 to 50 mg/kg given weekly or bi-weekly in animals not positive for ADA. When ADA are not 
predominant, kinetics are typical for IgG/FcRn mediated elimination with long half-lives of 5.2-11.1 days and 
slow clearance 0.16-0.32mL/h/kg. 
The apparent elimination half-life of nivolumab in cynomolgus monkeys following a single IV dose of 1 mg/kg 
was 124 to 148 hours and was longer with higher doses. Consistent with the long half-life, the total serum 
clearance after a single dose of nivolumab was low (0.16-0.32 mL/h/kg). The steady state volume of distribution 
was similar to the reported plasma volume of monkeys (0.046-0.071 L/kg), suggesting that nivolumab remains 
mainly in the vascular system.  
Since nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody and does not belong to a class of medicinal products expected to 
cause cardiovascular effects, specific safety pharmacology studies were limited to a single-dose cardiovascular 
safety study in Cynomolgus monkeys. This limited safety pharmacology evaluation of nivolumab is supported by 
ICH guidelines S6(R1), S7A, and S9, which do not require specific safety pharmacology studies for 
biotechnology-derived products, such as monoclonal antibodies, or for anticancer pharmaceuticals. It is 
considered that for this type of product, the lack of studies for secondary pharmacodynamics are acceptable.

In  the  repeat  toxicity  studies,  serum  chemistry  changes  were  limited  to  a  28%  decrease  in  mean  plasma 
triiodothyronine (T3) levels at 50 mg/kg in female monkeys at the end of the 3-month dosing phase of the study 
with complete recovery after a 4-week dose-free period. The relevance of the lower T3 levels in females, in the 
absence of any correlative changes in other hormones or in the thyroid or pituitary gland, is unknown but does 
not cause any particular concern.  
The applicant did not submit studies for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity as well as fertility and early embryonic 
development.  According to ICH guideline S6(R1) “Preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals” (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998), these studies are not required and are not warranted to 
support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer (ICH guideline S9 
“Nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals” EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008), the lack of studies is 
acceptable. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, no nivolumab-related gross or microscopic pathology changes were observed. 
Pivotal 1- and 3-month IV repeat-dose toxicity studies of nivolumab alone were conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys. The product was well tolerated, with no adverse effects at doses ≤50 mg/kg administered up to one 
month once a week or 3 months twice a week. In the 1-month study, while PD-1 receptor occupancy was 
demonstrated throughout the dosing phase, no changes in peripheral blood immune cell subpopulations were 
observed. In the 3-month study, changes in immune cell parameters were observed, demonstrating that 
nivolumab elicited pharmacological responses in healthy monkeys. 
Regarding reproductive toxicity, the ePPND study was conducted following the recommendations included in the 
PIP P/0064/2014 agreed with the EMA on March 2014 with the non clinical working group of the PDCO. 
Nivolumab was administered 2QW at 10 or 50 mg/kg to pregnant monkeys from GD 20 to 22 until parturition. 
Nivolumab was well tolerated and there were no nivolumab-related effects on viability, clinical signs, food 
consumption, body weights, immunological endpoints or clinical/anatomic pathology parameters in dams 
throughout the study. However, in the offspring, maternal nivolumab administration was associated with 
foetal/neonatal mortality, with dose-dependent increases in third trimester foetal loses and increased neonatal 
mortality at 10 mg/kg during the first 2 postnatal weeks. The cause of these foetal losses and infant prematurity 
could not be determined. However, a relationship between pregnancy failure and a break in tolerance by the 
abrogation of PD-1 signalling by nivolumab cannot be ruled out. This information is stated in section 5.3 and the 
potential risk to pregnant women is adequately addressed in section 4.6 of the SmPC. The risk of embryofoetal 
toxicity has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
No juvenile toxicity studies were conducted by the Applicant. In the ePPND study infant monkeys were assessed 
up to 6 month old, whereas in the pivotal toxicity studies some monkeys were 2 years old, approximately 
equivalent to a 6-year old human. No developmental effects were observed in any of these studies.  
Considering the lack of irritation or local tolerance issues found in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys, no additional local tolerance studies are considered necessary. 
As a selective immunomodulator, nivolumab is expected to elicit pharmacologically mediated effects on the 
immune system. Repeated administration of nivolumab alone for 3 months at ≥ 10 mg/kg produced 
pharmacologic effects on specific immune cell sub-populations, but no general nonspecific immunostimulatory 
or autoimmune-related toxicities were observed.  
ADAs were detected in 4% of monkeys receiving 2QW doses of nivolumab, 20% to 53% of monkeys receiving 
weekly doses of nivolumab, and 67% of monkeys receiving monthly doses of nivolumab.  Nivolumab 
concentrations were lower in animals with anti-nivolumab antibodies. ADA incidence was predominantly 
increased in the low dose groups, which may be a result of assay interference.

The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the guideline, in the case of products containing 
proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for the 
marketing authorisation application for nivolumab, were considered adequate and acceptable for the 
assessment of non-clinical aspects. The lack of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, fertility and early embryonic 
development were well justified. Based on cynomolgus monkey studies, there is a potential risk for foetal loss in 
the third semester in humans. In addition, the cynomolgus monkey model showed development of ADAs after 
repeat administration. These risks are adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Nivolumab is dosed via the IV route and therefore is completely bioavailable. 
Distribution 
Single Dose Pharmacokinetics: Study MDX1106-01 
The single-dose PK of nivolumab was described by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of data from 39 subjects 
in MDX1106-01 (also known as CA209001), which was a Phase 1 study in patients with selected refractory or 
relapsed malignancies. The single-dose PK of nivolumab was determined from serum concentrations collected 
up to 85 days following single doses of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, given as 1-hour IV infusion in MDX1106-01. 
Following a single-dose IV administration of nivolumab ranging from 0.3 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg mean volume of 
distribution (Vz) varied between 83 to 113 mL/kg across doses. Mean clearance and mean elimination half-life 
ranged from 0.13  to 0.19 ml/h/kg and  between 17 and 25 days, across the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg dose.

Abbreviations: Geo mean=geometric mean; CV=coefficient of variation; SD=standard deviation 
Volume of distribution as estimated by popPK analysis was 8.00 L (35.3%).   
Multiple-dose Administration: Study MDX1106-03  
The multiple-dose PK of nivolumab given Q2W was assessed by NCA in MDX1106-03. Intensive PK serum 
concentration samples were collected from all subjects enrolled in 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg melanoma cohorts and 
first 16 subjects each from 3 and 10 mg/kg NSCLC cohorts over 336 hours (15 days) after first dose (Cycle 1) 
and ninth dose (Cycle 3). Limited PK samples were collected from all other pre-amendment 4 subjects and from 
all subjects enrolled in 1 mg/kg RCC cohort, 1 mg/kg NSCLC and remaining 16 subjects each from 3 and 10 
mg/kg NSCLC in this study. Single samples were collected to evaluate serum concentrations of nivolumab at all 
follow-up visits.  
The results from study MDX1106-03 is shown in Table 18. 
Table 18: 
MDX1106-03 
Summary of nivolumab multiple dose pharmacokinetic parameters – Study 
The population PK analysis showed a 2-compartment PK model with first order elimination. Both the clearance 
and the volume in the central compartment on nivolumab increase with body weight (ranged from 34 to 162 kg 
with a mean weight of 81 kg). This fact has been addressed by means of weight normalized dosing. 
Elimination 
The mean terminal elimination half-life of nivolumab ranged between 17 and 27.5 days following single dose 
(study MDX1106-01) and Q2W administration (MDX1106-03) across the range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg dose.  
The geometric mean (%CV) of PopPK model-based estimates of individual nivolumab CL, volume of distribution 
at steady state (VSS), and terminal half life were 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), 8.0 L (30.4%), and 26.7 days (101.0%), 
respectively. The typical clearance was 8.7 mL/h.

Metabolism 
No formal studies were conducted as nivolumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin and not metabolized by 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, it is degraded to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The proportionality of the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab over the dose range 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg was 
investigated in study MDX1106-03 and  is presented in Figure 9. Following a one hour IV infusion, maximum 
concentrations of nivolumab were reached at median Tmax of 1.1 to 3.9h after Cycle 1/Day 1 dose.

PopPK analyses 
Population PK (popPK) analysis was based on intensive and sparse PK sampling mainly between Day 1 (Cycle 1) 
and Day 99 (Cycle 8) from 909 patients with solid tumors who received 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q2W during the 
dosing period (MDX1106-01, ONO-4538-01, ONO- 4538-02, MDX1106-03, CA209010, CA209063 and 
CA209037). The PopPK model parameters were estimated with precision, and the model evaluation 
demonstrated that there was good agreement between model predictions and observations (Figure 10).

Impaired renal function 
Specific PK studies in patients with renal impairment were not conducted. Lack of effect of renal function 
(normal, mild or moderate) on the PK of nivolumab was obtained from the PopPK analysis. Limited data (n=2) 
were available for severe renal impairment assessment.

 
Impaired hepatic function 
No formal studies were conducted. The assessment of hepatic status is limited to the normal and mild 
abnormalities integrated in the PopPK analysis. PopPK analysis showed mild hepatic impairment had similar CL 
and exposures relative to normal subjects. 
  Body Weight 
PopPK analysis with CDA209037 showed that both clearance (CL) and volume of central compartment (VC) 
increase with body weight. However, nivolumab exposures (dose normalized Cminss and Cavgss) are 
comparable across the range of body weight (34-162 kg) when administered based on mg/kg.  
  Elderly 
PopPK analysis with CDA209037 showed that age was not a significant covariate on nivolumab CL. Nivolumab 
exposure (dose normalized Cavgss) was similar across the age ranging from 29 to 87 years.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD effects of nivolumab were studied by assessing receptor occupancy (RO), peripheral immune cell 
population modulation, systemic cytokine modulation, and change in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in 
studies MDX1106-03 and/or CA209009. 
Mechanism of action 
PD-1 Receptor Occupancy by Nivolumab 
PD-1 receptor occupancy by nivolumab was investigated in studies MDX1106-03 and CA209009.  In study 
MDX1106-03, RO was determined in using frozen peripheral CD3+ T-cells from 65 melanoma subjects treated 
with one cycle (4 doses Q2W) of nivolumab at doses of 0.1 to 10.0 mg/kg. The median PD-1-receptor occupancy 
by nivolumab was 64 to 70% across all dose levels (Table 20).  
Table 20: 
Receptor occupancy prior to fifth dose administration (all treated subjects with receptor occupancy) - 
Study MDX1106-03 
In the nivolumab metastatic RCC study CA209009, receptor occupancy was assessed using fresh whole blood 
specimens. RO of >d90% was achieved at one hour post nivolumab treatment at all dose levels, and remained 
near this level through Dose 8 Day 1. 
Lymphocyte phenotype, absolute lymphocyte count, cytokine and chemokine modulation by 
nivolumab 
Peripheral immune cell populations as measured by flow cytometry and change in ALC from baseline was 
evaluated in study MDX1106-03. The effect of nivolumab on cytokine modulation was assessed in CA209009 by 
measuring cytokine levels during the course of nivolumab treatment. The activated CD8+ T-cell mean changes 
by nivolumab dose were on average 3.8%, 0.4%, 2.3%, 5.8%, and 0.1% for 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, 
respectively. No meaningful rise over baseline was observed in mean ALC. 
The effect of nivolumab on cytokine modulation was assessed in CA209009 by measuring cytokine levels during 
the course of nivolumab treatment. Nivolumab was administered at 0.3, 2 and 10 mg/kg dose levels every three 
weeks. Cytokine levels were measured at Dose 1 (0, 3, 7, 24 hr), Dose 2 (0, 168 hr), Dose 4 (0 hr), Dose 7 
(0,168 hr) and Dose 8 (0 hr). The study showed that IL-1A, IL-1B, INF-γ, TNF-α, IL-12P and IL-23M were found 
to be below the lower limit of quantification. The levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-2 soluble receptor α showed 
transient changes but these were not consistent between individuals. The levels of CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 
increased from baseline across any treatment dose group.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PD-1 Receptor Occupancy by Nivolumab 
PD-1 RO by nivolumab was investigated in studies MDX1106-03 and CA209009.  In study MDX1106-03, RO was 
determined in using frozen peripheral CD3+ T-cells from 65 melanoma subjects treated with one cycle (4 doses 
Q2W) of nivolumab at doses of 0.1 to 10.0 mg/kg. The median PD-1-receptor occupancy by nivolumab was 64 
to 70% across all dose levels (Table 21). These results demonstrate that the majority of PD-1 receptors are 
bound by nivolumab at the lowest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg). Increasing doses up to 10.0 mg/kg did not 
substantially increase PD-1 receptor occupancy at the time point tested. 
Table 21: 
Receptor Occupancy Prior to Fifth Dose Administration - All Treated Subjects with 
Receptor Occupancy - Study MDX1106-03 
In the nivolumab metastatic RCC study CA209009, RO was assessed using fresh whole blood specimens. RO of 
peripheral CD3+ T cells (and CD4+ or CD8+ subsets) was measured at baseline and at six timepoints following 
initiation of nivolumab treatment (Dose 1-1H, Dose 2-0H, Dose 4-0H, Dose 7-0H, Dose 7-1H, Dose 8-0H). 
Kinetics of RO were similar across all dose cohorts (0.3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg-treatment naive) 
(Figure 12) Receptor occupancy of >d90% was achieved at one hour post nivolumab treatment at all dose 
levels, and remained near this level through Dose 8 Day 1.

PD-L1 Expression as a Potential Biomarker  
In study MDX1106-03, evaluable archival tumour tissue was available from 36% (38/107) of melanoma and 
49% (63/129) of NSCLC subjects indicating a low ascertainment rate. For PD-L1 expression data analysis, 1% 
and 5% thresholds were utilized to assess PD-L1 positivity. The proportion of PD-L1 positive tumour samples 
were determined in both melanoma and NSCLC tumours (Table 22).  
PD-L1 expression in one or more immune cells was analysed. Using either tumour cell PD-L1 positivity (1% and 
5%) or any immune cell PD-L1 expression as an indicator of a positive sample, the proportion of PD-L1 positive 
subjects was around 90% in both melanoma and NSCLC.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology profile of nivolumab has been characterized based on data from 8 Phase 1/2/3 clinical 
studies conducted in the clinical program. Pharmacokinetics has mainly been documented in patients with 
different type of solid tumors (NSCLC, Melanoma, RCC, CRC, CRPC, others) and not in healthy volunteers. 
The dose proposed for nivolumab montherapy is 3 mg/kg administered intravenously over 60 minutes every 2 
weeks. 
Study MDX1106-01 pharmacokinetics of nivolumab was analysed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) of data 
from 39 subjects dose ranging between 0.3 and 10 mg/kg. The single-dose PK of nivolumab was dose 
proportional in the range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg: there was no correlation between dose and clearance, volume of 
distribution or elimination half-life. The mean volume of distribution after a single dose administration was small 
(between 83 to 113 mL/kg) and consistent with localization in the extracellular fluid, as observed for other IgG 
mAbs with large molecular weight. Pharmacokinetics of nivolumab seemed dose proportional over the dose 
range 0.1 mg/kg-10 mg/kg. No signs of time dependent PK parameters were observed over the period studied. 
According to popPK analysis nivolumab accumulation index of approximately 3-fold was consistent with the 
estimated half-life of 26.7 days for 3 mg/kg dosing every 2 weeks. Steady state was achieved approximately at 
the 6th dose (12 weeks).  
The geometric mean (%CV) of PopPK model-based estimates of individual nivolumab CL, volume of distribution 
at steady state (VSS), and terminal half life were 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), 8.0 L (30.4%), and 26.7 days (101.0%), 
respectively. The typical clearance was 8.7 mL/h.Nivolumab, is expected to be cleared through receptor 
mediated endocytosis or non-specific endocytosis followed by proteolytic degradation mainly in hepatic or 
reticuloendothelial cells. Therefore, no renal elimination is expected given the large molecular weight of 
monoclonal antibodies. As nivolumab is not subject of metabolism by CYP450 enzymes no classical studies 
regarding metabolism or elimination were deemed necessary. The estimated terminal half-life ranged between 
17 and 25 days and was consistent with a fully human mAb. The proposed dosing interval of 2 weeks is shorter 
than the observed terminal half-life. 
No formal studies have been conducted in special populations, such as renal and hepatic impaired patients as 
only patients with mild hepatic abnormalities were included in the clinical studies. PopPk analysis has shown a 
lack of effect on the PK of nivolumab in patients with renal impairment. PopPK analysis showed that eGFR did not 
have a clinically relevant effect on nivolumab CL. Results indicate that no dose adjustment is needed for subject 
with mild and moderate renal impairment. PopPk analysis has shown a lack of effect on the PK of nivolumab in 
patients with hepatic impairment. Subjects with mild hepatic impairment had similar CL and exposures relative 
to normal subjects, suggesting that no dose adjustment is needed for subjects with mild hepatic impairment. 
PopPK analysis did not have any subject with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, thus the assessment of 
effect of moderate and severe hepatic was not available. This range is reflected in the SmPC in section 4.2. 
PopPK analysis indicated a higher clearance of nivolumab with increasing body weight. With dosing of nivolumab 
on an mg/kg basis, no additional dose adjustment is needed for body weight. Thus, dosing per body weight is 
acceptable across the range of 34-162 kg. The PopPK model seems to provide an adequate description of 
nivolumab concentration-time data in solid tumours. The values of the PopPK analysis are consistent with the 
corresponding values estimated by non-compartmental analysis and they can be considered in line with data 
from other fully human IgG antibodies. 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted to support the use of nivolumab as monotherapy. 
As nivolumab is not expected to be metabolized by liver cytochrome P450 or other drug metabolizing enzymes, 
it is unlikely to have an effect on CYPs or other drug metabolizing enzymes in terms of inhibition or induction.

However, recent literature reports suggest that therapeutic proteins that modulators of cytokines may indirectly 
affect expression of cytochrome (CYP) enzymes. The indirect drug-drug interaction potential of nivolumab was 
assessed using systemic cytokine modulation data for cytokines known to modulate CYP enzymes, at single and 
multiple doses of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg Q3W from CA209009. This dose range covers the exposure of nivolumab at 
proposed dosing regimen of 3 mg/kg Q2W. There was no meaningful change in cytokines across all dose levels 
of nivolumab (0.3, 2 and 10 mg/kg) during the course of treatment. This lack of cytokine modulation suggests 
that nivolumab has no or low potential for modulating CYP enzymes, thereby indicating a low risk of therapeutic 
protein-drug interaction. 
No thorough QT/QTc study with nivolumab was submitted, which is considered acceptable.  The nivolumab 
exposure obtained with the 10 mg/kg Q3W in the QT study was considered sufficient for obtaining a relevant 
outcome as 10 mg/kg Q3W provides higher Cmin and AUC compared to proposed 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen. 
Nivolumab, within the range of doses studied up to 10 mg/kg Q3W did not meaningfully affect the QTc interval. 
There was no discernible relationship between nivolumab serum concentration and change in QTcF. 
Peripheral RO of PD-1 was saturated at doses ≥ 0.3 mg/kg dose levels, which was lower than the proposed dose 
of 3 mg/kg. In peripheral blood, neither clinically relevant changes in the count of activated T cells nor changes 
in the absolute lymphocyte counts during treatment with nivolumab were observed. Demonstration of 
peripheral immunomodulatory activity of nivolumab was limited to chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. Relation 
between baseline absolute lymphocyte count and response to treatment could not be established. PD-L1 
expression on the tumour did not appear to be related to efficacy response in study MXD1106-03. The value of 
PD-L1 and PD-L2 as biomarker to predict the efficacy of nivolumab should be further investigated (see clinical 
discussion).  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of nivolumab has been mainly characterized by means of a PopPK model which 
is considered acceptable. The dose is considered to be appropriately investigated and well defined. The CHMP is 
of the opinion that the relevance of PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression as biomarkers, in the tumour microenvironment 
as well as in the peripheral compartment, should be further explored (see clinical conclusions).  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose rationale 
In study MDX1106-03, increasing doses of nivolumab were tested in order to evaluate efficacy response in 
patients with different type of tumours. There was a greater percent of objective responses observed in NSCLC 
subjects treated with 3 mg/kg (24.3%) and 10 mg/kg (20.3%) nivolumab than with 1 mg/kg (3%) nivolumab. 
There was no apparent relationship between nivolumab dose and ORR in melanoma and RCC (Table 23).

Table 23: 
Overview of objective response rates of nivolumab across tumour types and dose 
levels – Study MDX1106-03 
In study MDX1106-03, increasing doses of nivolumab were tested in order to evaluate efficacy response in 
patients with different type of tumours. The nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs) were 
similar across the dose range 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and across tumour types (Table 24). 
Table 24: 
Frequency of Drug-related Adverse Events across Dose Groups – Study MDX1106-03 
Based on above data and analyses across tumour types, 3 mg/kg IV Q2W was selected as the nivolumab 
monotherapy dose and schedule for all indications.

Key Exploratory Objectives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 54/130 
 
  
  
To evaluate duration of and time to objective response of nivolumab and dacarbazine. 
To assess the overall safety and tolerability of nivolumab vs dacarbazine. 
To characterize the immunogenicity of nivolumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was OS in all randomised subjects. 
The secondary endpoints were investigator-assessed PFS and ORR per RECIST v1.1 criteria, and OS based on 
PD-L1 expression level.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR). 
OS was defined as the time between the date of randomisation and the date of death. For subjects without 
documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive. 
Investigator-assessed PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to the date of the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who died without a reported 
progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die 
were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumour assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study 
tumour assessments and did not die were censored on their date of randomisation. Subjects who started any 
subsequent anticancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumor assessment prior to initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. 
Investigator-assessed ORR was defined as the number of subjects with a BOR of CR or PR divided by the number 
of randomised subjects for each treatment arm. The BOR is defined as the best response designation, as 
determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 without requirement of confirmation, recorded between the 
date of randomisation and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of 
subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. 
OS based on PD-L1 expression level defined as the percent of tumour cells demonstrating plasma membrane 
PD-L1 staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells per a Dako PD-L1 IHC assay (this is referred to as 
quantifiable PD-L1 expression). In this CSR, OS was assessed based on PD-L1 status using a verified assay with 
≥5% tumour cell membrane expression cutoff.  
Tumour tissues (from metastatic or unresectable site) were collected at screening and assessed for PD-L1 status 
prior to randomisation for use as a stratification factor. 
Evaluation of Target Lesions 
  Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 
5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 55/130 
 
  
  
  Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
Tumor assessments should first be performed at 9 weeks (± 1 wk) following randomisation then every 6 weeks 
(± 1 wk) thereafter for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks (± 1 wk) until disease progression or 
treatment discontinuation. 
Sample size 
The study design required at least 312 deaths to ensure approximately 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) 
of 0.69 with an overall type I error of 0.05 (two-sided). The HR of 0.69 corresponds to a 45% increase in the 
median OS, assuming a median OS of 10 months for dacarbazine and 14.49 months for nivolumab. One formal 
interim analysis was planned to be conducted. The stopping boundaries at the interim and final analyses will be 
derived based on the exact number of deaths using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries. At the time of the database lock for analysis, 146 deaths were observed. The boundary for statistical 
significance was calculated based on the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming type 
boundaries and required the unadjusted log rank p-value to be less than 0.0021 to conclude OS benefit for 
nivolumab relative to dacarbazine. The corresponding confidence interval is the 99.79% [(1-.0021)*100%] 
confidence interval  presented in this analysis. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all eligibility criteria were randomised by IVRS in a 1:1 ratio to the nivolumab group or the 
dacarbazine group, with stratification by: 
 
PD-L1 status 
o  PD-L1 positive (≥ 5% tumour cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumour 
cells) vs 
o  PD-L1 negative (≤ 5% tumour cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumour 
cells)/indeterminate (tumour cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining or 
melanin content) 
  M stage  
o  M0/M1a/M1b vs 
o  M1c 
Blinding (masking) 
The applicant, patients, investigators, and site staff were blinded to the study drug administered (nivolumab or 
dacarbazine). 
Statistical methods 
Standard methods of survival analysis were used. The primary analysis of OS in all randomised subjects was 
conducted using a two-sided logrank test stratified by PD-L1 status and M stage. The hazard ratio and 
corresponding two-sided (1-adjusted )% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using a Cox proportional 
hazards model, with treatment arm as a single covariate, stratified by the above factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 56/130 
 
  
  
P-values other than those provided for the OS primary analysis and the hierarchical analysis of key secondary 
endpoints were for descriptive purpose only and not adjusted for multiplicity: 
 
If OS superiority in all randomised subjects was demonstrated, a gatekeeping testing approach for key 
secondary endpoints would be applied as described in the SAP. Key secondary endpoints included PFS in 
all subjects and ORR in all randomised subjects. 
  Analysis of PFS in all randomised subjects was conducted using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by 
PD-L1 status and M stage. The hazard ratio and corresponding two-sided (1- adjusted α)% confidence 
interval was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, with treatment arm as a single 
covariate, stratified by the above factors. PFS curves, PFS medians with 95% CIs, and PFS rates at 6 and 
12 months with 95% CIs was estimated using Kaplan- Meier methodology. 
  Analysis of ORR was conducted using a Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by the 
corresponding factors above for all randomised subjects. ORR estimates and corresponding 95%CIs, 
calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method, would be provided by treatment arm. 
To evaluate PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker, a Cox proportional hazards model was to be used to 
test the interaction between PD-L1 expression (positive vs negative) and treatment arm for the OS endpoint. 
Additionally, OS was analysed within each PD-L1 expression subgroup (positive and negative) including log-rank 
tests and hazard ratios with corresponding confidence intervals. OS curves and medians was estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. These analyses will be descriptive and not adjusted for multiplicity. Other 
exploratory analyses, such as associations between PD-L1 expression and other efficacy endpoints and 
evaluations of different thresholds for PD-L1 positivity, were also planned.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from January 2013 until February 2014. This study was conducted at 76 sites in 16 
countries (Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, 
Mexico, Norway, Poland, Spain, and Sweden). 
Conduct of the study 
An independent DMC was established to provide oversight of safety and efficacy considerations, study conduct, 
and risk-benefit ratio. Following review, the DMC was to recommend continuation, modification, or 
discontinuation of this study based on reported safety and efficacy data. 
During the first DMC safety review on 05-Nov-2013, the committee noted a potential difference in OS and 
requested to receive monthly death summaries starting in December 2013 and Kaplan- Meier curves of OS 
starting in Jan-2014. With the 5-May-2014 data transfer, the report included a table with median survival times 
along with the hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. At the 10-Jun-2014 meeting, the 
DMC requested the O’Brien-Fleming boundary be given for the fraction of events presented in the June summary 
report. 
The plan for the study as described in the DMC charter included only a single interim review of OS scheduled to 
occur when approximately 218 deaths had occurred (70% of the total 312 deaths). This was expected to occur 
in Mar-2015. The transfer used for the Jun-2014 report included a total of 110 deaths (35% of the 312 total 
expected deaths). The O’Brien-Fleming boundary based on a Lan-DeMets spending function calculated in East 
6.2 software for 110 deaths would have a p-value of 0.00032 (hazard ratio of 0.50). The log-rank p-value based 
on the 110 deaths is 0.000085. Assuming two interim analyses (eg, one at 110 deaths and one at 218 deaths), 
the nominal significance level would remain approximately unchanged at 0.0455 (hazard ratio of 0.80) for the 
final OS analysis at 312 deaths. (The plan in the protocol with a single interim look at 218 deaths had a nominal 
significance level of 0.0455 for the final OS analysis at 312 deaths.) 
Based on the 10-Jun-2014 review of data from the DMC-requested 23-May-2014 database lock, the DMC  
informed BMS that there was clear evidence of a survival benefit in subjects receiving nivolumab compared to 
dacarbazine. As a result, the DMC recommended that the study be unblinded and subjects randomised to 
dacarbazine who had ended study treatment be allowed to receive treatment with nivolumab. They did allow for 
those subjects deriving benefit from dacarbazine to remain on current therapy. The efficacy data from CA09066 
that is presented is based on a clinical cutoff date of 24-Jun-2014, prior to any dacarbazine subjects being 
treated with nivolumab. 
Changes to the study protocol was based on 6 amendments.

Table 25: 
 Protocol amendments – Study CA209066 
After the clinical cutoff date (24-Jun-2014), the protocol was amended on 09-Jul-2014 per DMC 
recommendations to allow subjects in the follow-up phase of the study who had received and discontinued from 
dacarbazine to receive nivolumab, as well as to provide a mechanism for subjects who were receiving 
dacarbazine to receive nivolumab upon discontinuation of dacarbazine. 
Baseline data 
Among all randomised subjects, the mean age was 62.7 (range: 18, 87) years and the majority of subjects were 
White (99.5%) and male (58.9%). The median duration of time from initial diagnosis was 1.9 (range: 0.1-32.6) 
years in the nivolumab group and 1.7 (range: 0.1-22.2) years in the dacarbazine group.

All subjects have BRAF wild type melanoma and advanced disease (as specified by the protocol). A high 
percentage of subjects had poor prognostic factors, including 55.7% M1c stage. Across treatment groups, the 
most common visceral sites of disease included lung (60.5% of subjects) and liver (30.9% of subjects). The 
majority of subjects should have a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 (as specified in the protocol). 
Prior adjuvant therapy, neo-adjuvant therapy, surgery related to cancer, and radiotherapy were balanced 
across treatment groups.

NOTE: Two-sided, 95% CI for median OS were computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method (log log 
transformation). The HR and the corresponding CI were estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazard model 
using randomized arm as a single covariate. 
Progression free survival 
The results of PFS are presented in Figure 15. The median PFS was 5.06 months (95% CI: 3.48, 10.81) in the 
nivolumab group and 2.17 months (95% CI: 2.10, 2.40) in the dacarbazine group. PFS rates for the nivolumab 
and dacarbazine groups at 6 months were 48.0% vs 18.5%, respectively, and at 12 months were 41.8% vs not 
produced (as all PFS times were less than 12 months for the dacarbazine group), respectively . There were 102 
(48.6%) subjects in the nivolumab (21.6%) subjects in the dacarbazine group censored, with the most common 
reasons for censoring listed as ‘still on treatment’ for the nivolumab group (37.6%) and ‘received subsequent 
therapy’ for the dacarbazine group (12.0%).

Treatments 
Nivolumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 75/130 
 
  
  
 
Nivolumab at 3 mg/kg, on Day 1 of each 2 week cycle, was administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes using 
a volumetric pump with a 0.2/0.22 micron in-line filter. Dosing calculations were based on the subject’s body 
weight. No premedications were recommended for initiation of dosing. 
Subjects received nivolumab until disease progression (or discontinuation of study therapy in patients receiving 
nivolumab beyond progression), discontinuation due to toxicity, or other protocol-specified reasons. 
Dose escalation or reduction was not permitted 
Subjects were permitted to continue nivolumab treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD as long as they 
met the following criteria: 
 
Investigator-assessed clinical benefit; and 
  Subject was tolerating study drug. 
Investigator’s choice 
All subjects were treated with an option not previously received as a prior anti-cancer therapy. A subject was 
only treated with one of the following options: 
1) Dacarbazine: administered as an open-label dose of 1000 mg/m2 as a 30 to 60 minute IV infusion on Day 1 
of a treatment cycle every 3 weeks (21 days). 
2) Carboplatin and paclitaxel: paclitaxel administered as an open-label dose of 175mg/m2 as a 180-minute IV 
infusion on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every 3 weeks (21 days). Carboplatin administered as an open-label dose 
of AUC 6 as a 30 minute IV infusion on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every 3 weeks (21 days). 
There was no dose escalation permitted for the investigator’s choice group. Dose reduction for the investigator’s 
choice group, was permitted due to hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities. Subjects who received the 
investigator’s choice therapy were not permitted to cross-over to nivolumab therapy, nor to be treated beyond 
progression. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
 
To estimate the ORR in nivolumab treatment group and to compare OS of nivolumab to investigator’s 
choice in subjects with advanced melanoma. 
Secondary Objectives 
 
 
 
To compare the PFS of nivolumab to investigator’s choice in subjects with advanced melanoma. 
To evaluate whether PD-L1 expression is a predictive biomarker for ORR and OS. 
To evaluate HRQoL as assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Care (EORTC) 
QLQ-C30. 
Exploratory Objectives 
 
 
To assess the overall safety and tolerability of nivolumab and investigator’s choice. 
To characterize the PK of nivolumab and explore exposure-response relationships with respect to safety 
and efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 76/130 
 
  
  
 
 
To characterize the immunogenicity of nivolumab. 
To explore potential biomarkers associated with clinical response to nivolumab by analyzing tumor 
tissue specimens and serum for proteins. 
 
To assess the effects of natural genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphism [SNPs]) in select 
genes including but not limited to PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CTLA-4 on clinical endpoints and/or on the 
occurrence of adverse events (AEs). 
 
To assess changes in health status in treatment groups by the EuroQoL EQ-5D both on treatment and 
during the survival follow-up period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint were ORR (as determined per IRRC) in nivolumab treated patients and OS. ORR 
was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR).  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
 
PFS 
  Best overall response rate (BOR) and Duration of Response (DOR; time between the date of first 
confirmed response to the date of the first documented progression) 
 
 
Time to Objective Response (TTR) 
Potential association between PD-L1 expression and efficacy endpoints of nivolumab and investigator’s 
choice. Biomarkers were measured in tumour tissues at screening and during the study from all 
patients. For determination of the PD-L1 status for analyses of the efficacy the Validated Dako PD-L1 
IHC assay was used. The PD-L1 expression status as determined by the (verified) Dako PD-L IHC assay 
also determined by a second (validated) Dako PD-L1 IHC assay. PD-L1 expression analysis was 
performed centrally (LabCorp Clinical trials, Los Angeles, CA).  
  Health related Quality of Life (HR QoL) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 
Primary endpoints 
The primary ORR analysis was performed on treated subjects among the ORR population (all randomized 
subjects to any treatment group with at least 6 months of follow-up at the time of ORR analysis timepoint) using 
treatment group ‘as treated’. 
The IRRC-determined ORR in the nivolumab group was estimated and its corresponding 95% exact two-sided CI 
was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
The IRRC-determined ORR in subjects treated with investigator’s choice is also presented, along with exact 95% 
two-sided CI. 
The unweighted differences in ORR between the two treatment groups and corresponding 95% two-sided CI 
using the method of Newcombe is provided. 
The BOR was summarized by response category for each treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 77/130 
 
  
  
 
To support the primary analyses, similar analyses of ORR were performed with the following modifications: 
  ORR as determined per investigator among the ORR population for each treatment group ‘as treated’. 
For subjects who continued nivolumab beyond progression, the BOR was determined based on response 
designations recorded up to the time of the initial RECISTv 1.1-defined progression as assessed by the 
investigator or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy. 
 
The IRRC-determined ORR on the entire ORR population (i.e., including randomized nontreated subjects 
among ORR population). The analysis was then performed by treatment group ‘as randomized’. 
To assess concordance between IRRC and investigator assessments, BOR was cross-tabulated by treatment 
group as randomized and assessment type (investigator vs. IRRC). Concordance Rate of Responders was 
computed as the frequency with which investigator and IRRC agree on classification of a subject as 
responder/non responder as a proportion of the total number of subjects assessed. 
Tumour responses and progression were assessed using RECIST v 1.1. Tumour assessments were conducted at 
9 weeks (± 1 week) following randomization then every 6 weeks (±1 week) for the first 12 months, thereafter 
every 12 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurred later. 
Immune related non-conventional responses were not included in calculations for response based analyses.  
Secondary Endpoint 
The criteria to analyze PFS were not reached at the time; therefore, only descriptive analyses of PFS for the ORR 
population were produced. 
The PFS (based on IRRC assessment) curves for each treatment group were estimated using the K-M 
product-limit method on the ORR population. Median PFS (with 95% CI) and PFS rate at 6 months (with 95% CI) 
were computed. 
The hazard ratio (HR) of nivolumab to investigator’s choice and corresponding 99.99% CI were estimated using 
a Cox-proportional hazards model, with treatment group as a single covariate, stratified by BRAF status, prior 
anti-CTLA-4 benefit, and PD-L1 status (IVRS source). 
The source of PFS event (death vs. progression) was summarised by treatment group. 
Exploratory endpoints included safety and tolerability of nivolumab and investigator’s choice, PK, evaluation of 
immunogenicity of nivolumab (serum ADA) and HRQoL measured by EuroQol EQ-5D.  
Sample size 
Approximately 390 subjects were to be randomised to the two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. The sample size 
of the study accounts for the co-primary efficacy endpoints: ORR (per IRRC) and OS with an alpha allocation of 
0.1% and 4.9% respectively. The formal analyses of ORR and OS are planned to be conducted at different times: 
with ORR being analyzed first (reported in this assessment report) and subsequent interim and final OS analyses 
to follow. 
Randomisation 
After eligibility was established and informed consent was obtained, subjects were enrolled into the study via an 
IVRS. Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Arm A [BMS-936558 
(nivolumab)] or Arm B (investigator’s choice) respectively. Subjects were stratified and balanced according to 
the following factors: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 78/130 
 
  
  
 
PD-L1 status 
 
PD-L1 positive (≥5% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor 
cells) vs. 
 
PD-L1 negative (< 5% tumor cell membrane staining in a minimum of a hundred evaluable tumor 
cells)/indeterminate (tumor cell membrane scoring hampered by high cytoplasmic staining or 
melanin content) 
  BRAF status: wildtype vs V600 mutation positive 
 
Prior anti-CTLA-4 best response: Prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy clinical benefit (Best Overall Response of 
Stable Disease, Partial Response or Complete Response) vs. No Prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy clinical benefit 
(Best Overall Response of Progressive Disease) 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was an open label study, hence the patients and treating physicians were not blinded to the treatment 
received. 
Statistical methods 
ORR 
The primary analysis of ORR in the nivolumab treatment group was performed when the first 120 subjects 
treated with nivolumab (i.e., approximately 180 treated subjects in total: 120 in the nivolumab group and 60 in 
the investigator’s choice group) had a minimum follow-up of 6 months and formal analysis was restricted to the 
subjects treated with nivolumab with at least 6 months of follow up. This allowed sufficient follow up for ORR to 
have a stable estimate, information on duration of response, as well as adequate safety follow up. 
The maximum width of the exact two-sided 95% CI was 17.1% when the ORR was expected to be in the 5% to 
30% range.  
OS 
At least 260 deaths are required to provide approximately 90% power to detect a HR of 0.65, corresponding to 
a median OS of 8 vs. 12.3 months (4.3 month difference) for the investigator’s choice and nivolumab groups, 
respectively, with an overall two-sided type I error of 4.9%. One OS interim analysis will be conducted when at 
least 169 deaths (i.e., 65% of total events) have been observed. The stopping boundaries at the interim and 
final OS analyses will be derived based on the exact number of deaths using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function 
with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. If the interim analysis of OS is performed at exactly 169 events, the study 
could be stopped for efficacy if the p-value is less than 0.0105. The nominal significance level for the final OS 
after 260 events would then be 0.0457.

A total of 631 subjects were enrolled. Of these, 405 (272 in the nivolumab and 133 in the investigator’s choice 
groups) were randomized into the study. The most common reasons for screening failure were: 
  198 (31.4%) subjects no longer met study criteria. 
  17 (2.7%) subjects withdrew consent. 
In addition, 3 subjects died before randomisation/treatment. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations were low in frequency, with 5 (1.8%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 5 (3.8%) subjects 
in the investigator’s choice group. The original protocol was amended 11 times. Main amendments consist of: 
1.  Date 19-Mar-2013: the summary of safety section was updated to include new preliminary reproductive 
toxicology data that was distributed as a non-clinical expedited safety report and to include change to the 
guidance on contraception. 
2.  Date 08-May-2013: the eligibility criteria were modified to expand the number of prior therapies allowed. 
Confirmation of objective response required and clarification that patients receiving palliative radiotherapy 
would be classified as having unequivocal progression.  
3.  Date 24-Dec-2013: the study design was updated to allow an adequately powered statistical comparison of 
the co-primary endpoint of ORR at an earlier time point while maintaining the power for statistical 
comparison of the other co-primary endpoint of OS. Formal analyses of ORR and OS will be conducted at 
different time points with ORR being analysed first followed by interim and final OS analyses. 
4.  Date 21-Apr-2014: The protocol was modified to include the updated statistical plans for a non-comparative 
estimation of the ORR. 
Baseline data 
The majority of patients were males (64.4%) and white (98.3%), with a median age of 60.0 years (range 23- 88 
yr), and an ECOG PS 0 (above 60%). The median duration of time since first diagnosis was 3.57 years (range: 
0.4-25.3) in the nivolumab group and 3.73 years (range 0.3-31.1). Most patients in both treatment groups had 
stage IV (96.0% vs 98.5%) and M1c disease (74.6% vs 76.7%) of which 51.1% of patients in the nivolumab and 
34.6% in the control arm had high LDH. Most patients had extensive disease with ≥2 sites of disease (78.7% vs. 
78.9%). The most common visceral sites included lung and liver. A higher percentage of patients in the 
nivolumab group than in the investigator’s choice group had a history of brain metastasis (19.5% vs. 13.5%, 
respectively).

Numbers analysed 
In this open-label study, a total of 35 of 405 subjects (8.6%) were randomized but did not continue in the 
treatment period of the study. More randomized subjects in the investigator’s choice group did not receive 
treatment compared to the subjects in the nivolumab group (4 [1.5%] in the nivolumab group and 31 [23.3%] 
in the investigator’s choice group). The most common reasons for a subject in the investigator’s choice group 
not receiving treatment after randomisation was “subject request to discontinue study treatment” and “subject 
withdrew consent”.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint were ORR (as determined per IRRC) in nivolumab treated patients and OS.  
Primary efficacy endpoint: IRRC- assessed ORR for treated patients among the ORR population 
The primary analysis of ORR in the nivolumab treatment groups was performed when the first 120 patients were 
treated with nivolumab had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. The ORR was assessed both by the investigator 
and by the independent radiology review committee (IRRC). 
The confirmed ORR as assessed by the IRRC was 31.7% (95% CI:23.5, 40.8) for the nivolumab arm and 10.6% 
(95% CI 3.5, 23.1) for the investigator’s choice arm. A confirmed BOR of CR was achieved in 4 (3.3.%) of the 
patients in the nivolumab arm. No CRs were reported for patients treated with investigator’s choice therapy. The 
unweighted difference in ORR between the two treatment groups was 21.0% (95% CI, 6.8, 31.7) (Table 34). 
Best response of SD was observed in 28 (23.3%) of the patients in the nivolumab of whom 12 had ongoing SD 
at the time of the data cut-off. In the control arm, SD was observed in 16 (34.0%) of the patients.  
The BOR could not be determined in 10% and 23.4% of the patients included in the nivolumab and investigator’s 
choice arm respectively.

Table 34: 
Best Overall Response per IRRC - Treated Subjects Among the ORR Population  - 
Study CA209037 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Overall survival 
In December 2014, a pre-specified interim analysis for OS was performed, based on a 12-Nov-2014 database 
lock, and reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) (16-Dec-2014). The DMC 
recommended continuation of the study without modification. The final analysis of OS is expected to occur in late 
2015. Focusing on the interim analysis for OS and with 70% [182/260] of the total death events required for 
final OS analysis, no benefit has been shown so far; HR of 0.93 for nivolumab over investigator’s choice 
chemotherapy [95% CI: 0.68, 0.1.26]). Median OS in the nivolumab vs. investigator’s choice chemotherapy 
group was 15.5 months (95% CI: 12.39, N.A.) vs. 13.7 months (95% CI: 11.5, N.A.). The 6-month OS rates 
were 76.7% (95% CI: 71,2, 81.3) and 78.6% (95% CI: 70.3, 84.8) for the nivolumab and investigator’s choice 
groups, respectively.

Secondary efficacy endpoint:  
 
Investigator assessed ORR in all randomised and treated patients  
The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR (all randomised patients) for nivolumab monotherapy, was higher 
than that for investigator’s choice chemotherapy (25.4% [95% CI: 20.3, 31.0] vs. 8.3% [95% CI: 4.2, 14.3]) 
with an ORR difference of 17.1% (95% CI: 9.5, 23.7; n=405). CR was achieved in 10 (3.7%) subjects, and 
confirmed PR was achieved in 59 (21.7%) subjects for nivolumab arm, whereas 0 subjects had confirmed CR, 
and 11 (8.3%) subjects had confirmed PR in the chemotherapy group. The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR 
for nivolumab (25.4% [95% CI: 20.3, 31.0] was numerically higher than that observed for dacarbazine- (4.4% 
[95% CI: 0.5, 15.1]) and carboplatin/paclitaxel-treated patients (15.8% [95% CI: 7.5, 27.9]). 
Investigator assessed, confirmed ORRs in all treated patients (n=370) were 25.7% [95% CI: 20.6, 31.4] in the 
nivolumab group (n=268) vs. 10.8% [95% CI: 5.5, 18.5]) in the chemotherapy group (n=102), with an ORR 
difference of 15.0% (95% CI: 6.0, 22.2).

  Progression-Free Survival 
The descriptive analysis of PFS as assessed by investigator demonstrated a median PFS of 3.42 months (95% 
CI: 2.43, 4.90) and a 6-month PFS rate of 42% (95% CI: 0.36, 0.48) in the nivolumab group. In the 
investigators’ choice group, the median PFS was 2.69 months (95% CI: 2.17, 3.71) and the 6-month PFS rate 
was 29% (95% CI: 0.20, 0.39). HR of 0.74 for PFS for nivolumab over investigator’s choice chemotherapy [95% 
CI: 0.57, 0.97]. For the PFS analysis, a total of 31.3% of the nivolumab treated patient were censored. Most 
(21.3%) of these patients were censored while they were still on treatment without progression at the time of 
the data cut-off. Other reasons for censoring patients in the nivolumab arm were; receiving subsequent therapy 
(6.6%) and treatment is stopped, without signs of progression but patient is still in follow-up (1.8%). 
In the investigator’s choice arm, a total of  36.1% of the patients were censored, with 9.8% being never treated. 
Another common reason for censoring was receiving subsequent therapy (21.8%). Furthermore, patients were 
censored because they were still on treatment without progression at the time of the data cut-off (0.8%), 
treatment is stopped without signs of progression but still in follow-up (3.0%).

PD-L1 Expression and Efficacy 
All patients in the ORR population had a PD-L1 result in IVRS using the verified assay. Based on the IVRS 
reported results, where PD-L1 positive status is defined as ≥5% tumour cell membrane expression, the PD-L1 
positivity rate in the ORR population was 45.1%. Objective responses were observed in patients from both the 
nivolumab and investigator’s choice arm regardless of PD-L1 expression status. In the nivolumab arm, the ORR 
was numerically higher in PD-L1 positive vs negative patients (43.6% [95% CI 30.3, 57.7] vs 20.3% [95% CI: 
11.3, 32.2]). Updated results in ORRs continued being higher for PD-L1 positive (35.1% [95% CI: 27.0, 43.9]) 
than for PD-L1 negative (16.0% [95% CI: 10.2, 23.5]). 
BRAF status and Efficacy 
Objective responses were observed with nivolumab treatment regardless of BRAF status, with an ORR of 34.0% 
(95% CI: 24.6, 44%) in BRAF wild-type patients and 23.1% (95% CI: 9.0, 43.6) in BRAF mutant patient. 
Updated results highlighted the same trend (ORR of 27.5% [95% CI: 21.6, 34.0] in BRAF wild-type patients and 
19.3% [95% CI: 10.0, 31.9] in BRAF mutant patient). 
Sensitivity analyses of the co-primary endpoint 
  ORR population (sensitivity analysis in the intention-to-treat population): the IRRC-assessed ORR in 
nivolumab-treated subjects was 31.1% (95% CI: 23.1, 40.2). The confirmed IRRC-assessed ORR in the 
investigator’s choice group was 8.3% (95% CI: 2.8, 18.4). 
 
Investigator-assessed ORR in treated subjects among the ORR population (sensitivity analysis): the 
confirmed ORR was 25.8% [95% CI: 18.3, 34.6]) in the nivolumab group, which was consistent with the 
ORR based on the primary IRRC assessment (31.7% [95% CI: 23.5, 40.8]). 
  A sensitivity analysis was performed on censoring for patients that were randomised to investigator’s choice 
but were never treated. There were 31 patients that were randomised but did not receive the treatment. 
These patients likely received subsequent therapy relatively shortly after randomisation including other 
available anti-PD-1 agents (at least 9 subjects went on to receive an anti-PD-1 agent). An ad hoc sensitivity 
analysis of OS restricted to the All Treated population demonstrated a decrease in the HR from 0.93 (95%CI 
Assessment report

0.68, 1.26) to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.16) in favour of nivolumab treatment, and the median OS for the 
investigator’s choice group decreased from 13.67 months to 11.83 months (Figure 25).

 
Time to Response and Duration of Response 
Most responses reported after nivolumab treatment were rapid. The median time to response was 2.1 months 
(range 1.6 to 7.4 months). Thirteen of the 38 (34.2%) patients responded by the time of first scan (9 weeks), 
and the majority (26 patients, 68.4%) responded by 2.5 months.  
The median time to response in the investigator’s choice arm was 3.5 months (range 2.1 to 6.1 months).

Of 120 treated subjects in the ORR population, 37 subjects that had progressed per RECIST v1.1 criteria as 
assessed by the investigators were subsequently considered eligible per protocol to receive continued 
nivolumab therapy. Of these 37 subjects, 10 (27.0%) subjects had a target lesion reduction of ≥ 30% compared 
to baseline after RECIST v1.1 progression.

Supportive studies 
Study CA209006 
In a Phase 1 study (CA209006: A Pilot Trial of a Vaccine Combining Multiple Class I Peptides and Montanide ISA 
51 VG with Escalating Doses of Anti-PD-1 Antibody BMS-936558 for Patients with Unresectable Stages III/IV 
Melanoma), the clinical safety and efficacy of nivolumab was assessed in a cohort of ipilimumab-refractory 
subjects that were similar to the CA209037 population. In this cohort, subjects had unresectable Stage III or IV 
melanoma and had experienced progression without responding to prior ipilimumab treatment (41 subjects). 
These subjects received nivolumab (without the vaccine) at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 
weeks for up to 2 years. 
Key efficacy findings in response-evaluable subjects in the cohort (38 subjects) were consistent with results 
from CA209037, and were as follows: 
- 
The confirmed investigator-assessed ORR was 26% (95% CI: 13.4, 43.1) 
-  7 subjects (18%) had SD at ≥24 weeks 
- 
- 
The median DOR was not reached and ranged from 36+ to 48+ weeks 
The PFS rate at 24 weeks was 44% 
Clinical efficacy by PD-L1 expression was not reported by cohort. Among the PD-L1 expression-evaluable 
subjects in all cohorts (44 subjects, including ipilimumab-refractory and -naive treated at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of 
nivolumab): 
-  12 subjects (27%) were PD-L1 positive using a 5% cutoff. 
-  Objective responses were associated with PD-L1 positive expression (≥5% tumor cell membrane 
expression compared with PD-L1 negative expression (67% vs. 19%). 
MDX1106-03 
In melanoma, using the 5% threshold, 7/17 (41%) of PD-L1+ subjects and 3/21 (14%) of PD-L1(-) showed an 
objective response to nivolumab suggesting a better objective responses to nivolumab in PD-L1+ subjects 
(Table 36). Similar percentages were noted using the 1% threshold. 
In NSCLC, using the 5% threshold, 5/31 (16%) of PD-L1+ subjects and 4/32 (13%) of PD-L1(-) subjects had 
objective responses to nivolumab. Similar percentages were noted using the 1% threshold. There was no 
apparent difference in objective response between PD-L1 positive and negative tumours.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant applied for the indication for the treatment of advanced melanoma (unresectable or metastatic) in 
adults. They submitted two pivotal studies to support their proposed indication. For first line in untreated 
patients, the study CA209066, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab  vs dacarbazine in 
subjects with BRAF wild type, previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma was submitted. For 
last line indication in patients who have progressed on or after anti-CTLA-4 therapy, and for those with BRAF 
V600 mutations, who have progressed on or after a BRAF inhibitor in addition to anti-CTLA-4-therapy, study 
CA209037, a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial of nivolumab vs investigator’s choice(dacarbazine or 
carboplatin and paclitaxel) in unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients progressing post anti-CTLA-4 
therapy was submitted.  
The study CA209066 was stopped early because of the results of the unplanned interim analysis, and as per DMC 
recommendation, the study was amended to allow subjects randomized to the dacarbazine group to receive 
nivolumab. The plan in the protocol with a single interim look at 218 deaths had a nominal significance level of 
0.0455 for the final OS analysis at 312 deaths. The preliminary results showed that the analysis of OS had 
reached an HR 0.46 (95%CI 0.31-0.69) with a stratified log-rank test p-value 0.000085, based on 110 deaths.  
The CHMP was concerned that from a statistical point of view, carrying out an unplanned interim analysis and 
altering the conduct of the study based on this analysis under the DMC which monitored every month the 
mortality, was questionable and would introduce uncertainties such as the potential for informative bias.  The 
O’Brien-Fleming based-analysis in the original SAP did not take into account the 9 reviews that were conducted 
by the DMC. However, the CHMP concluded that the consistency of the data observed for overall survival, the 
subgroup analyses and the support of secondary variables, the effect observed was compelling and that major 
biases were unlikely. 
Although the CHMP considered that the design and conduct of study CA209037 did not raise any major issues, 
the CHMP highlighted that use of ORR as a primary variable was not recommended and OS should have been 
favoured as primary endpoint in an open label trial in last-line setting in order to best assess the true magnitude 
of the clinical benefit of nivolumab treatment in this patient population.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose rationale 
The nivolumab monotherapy dose and schedule of 3 mg/kg Q2W was based most importantly on the observed 
clinical safety and efficacy from the 306 subjects treated in MDX1106-03 across different dose levels and tumour 
types. The data from study MDX1106-03 in support of the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing were as follows: 
  Nivolumab had dose-proportional exposure over the dose range studied; with no effect of tumour type on 
PK. Body weight based dosing produced approximately uniform exposure in subjects with body weight range 
34-162 kg. 
  Receptor occupancy was maintained at high levels across the dose range 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and over multiple 
cycles of drug administration. 
 
There was a greater percent of objective responses observed in NSCLC subjects treated with 3 mg/kg 
(24.3%) and 10 mg/kg (20.3%) nivolumab than with 1 mg/kg (3%) nivolumab. There was no apparent 
relationship between nivolumab dose and ORR in melanoma and RCC.  
Efficacy 
First line treatment – Study CA209066 
Study CA209066 was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind study (CA209066) which enrolled adult patients with 
confirmed, treatment-naive, Stage III or IV BRAF wild-type melanoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or 1 which were treated with either nivolumab 3 mg/kg or 
dacarbazine. Patients with active autoimmune disease, ocular melanoma, or active brain or leptomeningeal 
metastases were excluded from the study. 
A total of 418 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab (n = 210) administered intravenously over 
60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or dacarbazine (n = 208) at 1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Randomisation 
was stratified by PD-L1 status and M stage (M0/M1a/M1b versus M1c). Treatment was continued as long as 
clinical benefit was observed or until treatment was no longer tolerated. Treatment after disease progression 
was permitted for patients who had a clinical benefit and did not have substantial adverse effects with the study 
drug, as determined by the investigator. Tumour assessments, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours (RECIST), version 1.1, were conducted 9 weeks after randomisation and continued 
every 6 weeks for the first year and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary efficacy outcome measure 
was overall survival (OS). Key secondary efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR). 
Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two groups. The median age was 65 years (range: 18-87), 
59% were men, and 99.5% were white. Most patients had ECOG performance score of 0 (64%) or 1 (34%). 
Sixty-one percent of patients had M1c stage disease at study entry. Seventy-four percent of patients had 
cutaneous melanoma, and 11% had mucosal melanoma; 35% of patients had PD-L1 positive melanoma (>5% 
tumour cell membrane expression). Sixteen percent of patients had received prior adjuvant therapy; the most 
common adjuvant treatment was interferon (9%). Four percent of patients had a history of brain metastasis, 
and 37% of patients had a baseline LDH level greater than ULN at study entry.  
Nivolumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS over dacarbazine in treatment-naive 
patients with BRAF wild-type advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (HR = 0.42; 
99.79%CI: 0.25, 0.73; p-value < 0.0001). Median OS was not reached for nivolumab and was 10.8 months 
(95% CI: 9.33, 12.09) for dacarbazine. The estimated OS rates at 12 months were 73% (95% CI: 65.5, 78.9)

and 42% (95% CI: 33.0, 50.9), respectively. The observed OS benefit was consistently demonstrated across 
subgroups of patients including baseline ECOG performance status, M stage, history of brain metastases, and 
baseline LDH level. Survival benefit was observed regardless of whether PD-L1 expression was above or below 
a PD-L1 tumour membrane expression cut-off of 5% or 10%. The results for OS show that there is a clear 
survival advantage for patients in the nivolumab treatment arm compared to patients in the dacarbazine arm for 
which the magnitude of the effect is clinically relevant. As of 07-Jan-2015, approximately 24 patients (22.2%) 
on the control arm have switched to treatment with nivolumab after the database lock for the final CSR. No data 
on the possible impact of this crossover has been provided yet. Therefore, in order to ascertain the magnitude 
of the OS survival as the proportion of number of events was small, the CHMP has imposed a condition to the 
marketing authorisation in Annex II, for the submission of updated results for OS.  
Nivolumab also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in PFS compared with dacarbazine 
(HR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.34, 0.56; p < 0.0001). The median PFS was 5.1 months (95%CI: 3.48, 10.81) for 
nivolumab and 2.2 months (95%CI: 2.10, 2.40) for dacarbazine. The estimated PFS rates at 6 months were 
48% (95%CI: 40.8, 54.9) and 18% (95%CI: 13.1, 24.6), respectively. The estimated PFS rate at 12 months 
was 42% (95% CI: 34.0, 49.3) for nivolumab.  
Response rates were low but the duration of response were pronounced reaching up to 12.5 months in the 
nivolumab arm. The investigator-assessed ORR using RECIST v1.1 criteria was significantly higher in the 
nivolumab group than in the dacarbazine group (OR: 4.06; p<0.0001). The ORR was 40.0% (95% CI: 33.3, 
47.0) in the nivolumab group vs 13.9% (95% CI: 9.5, 19.4) in the dacarbazine group. A higher proportion of 
subjects had CR in the nivolumab group than the dacarbazine group (7.6% vs 1.0%, respectively). The median 
time to response was similar for both groups, 2.10 months (range: 1.2 to 7.6) in the nivolumab group and 2.10 
months (range 1.8 to 3.6) in the dacarbazine group.  
It is important to note that the benefit of nivolumab was seen regardless of the presence of distant metastases 
and the positivity of PD-L1 tumours. The differences observed for OS and PFS in patients with PD-L1 positive and 
negative tumours are not considered important at this point since patients which have negative PD-L1 tumours 
also appear to derive some clinically relevant benefit from nivolumab. Therefore, a restriction of the population 
to patients expressing PD-L1 is not justified. The expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in the tumour 
microenvironment and the relationship with tumour responses needs to be further investigated. The CHMP has 
imposed a condition to the marketing authorization in Annex II to perform further analyses to ascertain the 
potential role of the PD-L2 biomarker, to further explore the relationship between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression 
on the efficacy of nivolumab, to continue the exploration of the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity and to further 
investigate the possible change in PD-L1 status of the tumour during treatment and/or tumour progression. 
Study CA209066 only enrolled patients which tumours tested BRAF WT but no data is available for first line 
treatment in patients bearing tumours which are BRAFV600 mutated. However, results from the study 
CA209037 where patients with BRAFV600 tumours that have been previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor show 
treatment benefit, it is reasonable to assume that patients with BRAFV600 tumours which have not yet been 
treated will also derive benefit from nivolumab treatment. 
Last line treatment – Study CA209037 
Study CA209037 was a phase 3, randomised, open-label study which enrolled adult patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma who had progressed on or after ipilimumab and if BRAF V600 mutation positive had also 
progressed on or after BRAF kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg or with the 
investigator’s choice of therapy. Patients with active autoimmune disease, ocular melanoma or a known history 
of prior ipilimumab-related high-grade (Grade 4 per CTCAE v4.0) adverse reactions, except for resolved nausea, 
fatigue, infusion reactions, or endocrinopathies, were excluded from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 99/130 
 
  
  
A total of 405 patients were randomised to receive either nivolumab (n = 272) administered intravenously over 
60 minutes at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or chemotherapy (n = 133) which consisted of the investigator’s choice 
of either dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) or carboplatin (AUC 6 every 3 weeks) and paclitaxel 
(175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). Randomisation was stratified by BRAF and PD-L1 status and best response to prior 
ipilimumab. The co-primary efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR, as measured by independent 
radiology review committee (IRRC) using RECIST 1.1, and comparison of OS of nivolumab to chemotherapy. 
Additional outcome measures included duration and timing of response.  The median age was 60 years 
(range: 23-88). Sixty-four percent of patients were men and 98% were white. ECOG performance scores were 
0 for 61% of patients and 1 for 39% of patients. The majority (75%) of patients had M1c stage disease at study 
entry. Seventy-three percent of patients had cutaneous melanoma and 10% had mucosal melanoma. The 
number of prior systemic regimen received was 1 for 27% of patients, 2 for 51% of patients, and > 2 for 21% 
of patients. Twenty-two percent of patients were BRAF mutation positive and 50% of patients were PD-L1 
positive. Sixty-four percent of patients had no prior clinical benefit (CR/PR or SD) on ipilimumab. Baseline 
characteristics were balanced between groups except for the proportions of patients who had a history of brain 
metastasis (19% and 13% in the nivolumab group and chemotherapy group, respectively) and patients with 
LDH greater than ULN at baseline (51% and 35%, respectively).  The baseline characteristics reflect an 
advanced metastatic population, in general evenly distributed, with a higher rate of elevated LDH and brain 
metastases for nivolumab arm vs investigator’s choice group (51% vs 35% and 19.5% vs 13.5% respectively) 
and a majority of subjects with M1c status (75%). 
For ORR, Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for nivolumab 25.4% [95% CI: 20.3, 31.0] vs. 8.3% [95% CI: 
4.2, 14.3]) for investigator’s choice, with an ORR difference of 17.1% (95% CI: 9.5, 23.7). CR was achieved in 
10 (3.7%) subjects, and confirmed PR was achieved in 59 (21.7%) subjects for nivolumab arm, whereas 0 
subjects had confirmed CR, and 11 (8.3%) subjects had confirmed PR in the chemotherapy group.  
Objective responses (in all treated subjects) to nivolumab were observed in patients with or without BRAF 
mutation-positive melanoma. The number of patients included with a mutated BRAF was low (57 vs. 22 in the 
nivolumab and investigator’s choice arm, respectively). Of the patients who received nivolumab, the ORR in the 
BRAF mutant subgroup was 19.3% (95% CI: 10.0, 31.9), and 27.5% (95% CI: 21.6, 34.0) in patients whose 
tumours were BRAF wild-type. The CHMP asked the applicant to commit to a post-authorisation measure to 
collect data and perform further analyses for PFS and tumour response in patients with BRAFV600 mutated 
tumours. The measure is included as part of the RMP. 
Objective responses to nivolumab were observed regardless of whether PD-L1 expression was above or below a 
PD-L1 tumour membrane expression cut-off of 5% or 10%.  
Regarding the results in PFS, descriptive results for PFS appear to show a benefit for nivolumab with HR=0.74 
over investigator’s choice chemotherapy (95% CI: 0.57, 0.97). A median PFS of 3.42 months (95% CI: 2.43, 
4.90) and 2.69 months (95% CI: 2.17, 3.71) was observed in the nivolumab and comparator’s arm. The 
difference in median PFS between the nivolumab and comparator arm was only 0.73 months, however after 3 
months of treatments, the two curves in the Kaplan-Meier Plot separate in favour of nivolumab.  
The OS data were not mature at the time of the PFS analysis. The OS HR was 0.93 (95%CI: 0.68, 0.1.26). The 
median OS in the nivolumab vs. investigator’s choice chemotherapy group was 15.5 months (95% CI: 12.39, 
N.A.) vs. 13.7 months (95% CI: 11.5, N.A.). The 6-month OS rates were 76.7% (95% CI: 71,2, 81.3) and 
78.6% (95% CI: 70.3, 84.8) for the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups, respectively. There was no 
statistically significant difference between nivolumab and chemotherapy in the preliminary OS analysis that was 
not adjusted for the potentially confounding effects of subsequent therapy. Of the 133 patients in the 
chemotherapy arm, 42 (31.6%) subsequently received an anti-PD1 treatment. The CHMP had concerns over the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 100/130 
 
  
  
shape of the OS curves, where nivolumab and the investigator’s choice of therapy crossed at around 9 months 
and it appeared that the OS was unfavourable for nivolumab early during treatment where there was an increase 
in deaths. The applicant provided a discussion on the possible confounding factors, mainly that there were 
baseline imbalances between the nivolumab arm and chemotherapy arm. There was a higher proportion of 
patients with brain metastases and elevated LDH, two risk factors that are known to negatively affect the 
outcome in melanoma patients. Another confounding factor was the use of post-progression therapies in the 
comparator arm, where 31.6% (42/133) of patients who had received investigator’s choice of therapy had 
subsequent systemic therapy with an anti-PD-1 therapy compared to 5.5% (15/272) in the nivolumab arm. The 
incidence of subsequent systemic therapy in the nivolumab vs. investigator’s choice group was 31.3% (85/272) 
vs. 54.9% (73/133), respectively. Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that a detrimental effect on OS does not 
appear likely. The same antibody has shown a clear survival benefit in the randomised phase 3 trial CA209066 
and all the sensitivity analyses carried out by the applicant support the main endpoints. Even though the final 
analysis of OS remains to be submitted, a different profile of the curves is not expected. 
The final analysis of OS is expected to occur in late 2015. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a condition to the 
marketing authorisation in Annex II for the submission of updated results for OS. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study CA209066 provided satisfactory evidence that nivolumab prolonged OS and PFS in melanoma 
patients in first line treatment. Therefore, the CHMP considers that efficacy of nivolumab in patients previously 
untreated with unresectable and metastatic melanoma has been demonstrated. The pivotal study CA209037 
provided satisfactory evidence that nivolumab treatment provided a clinically relevant benefit in terms of 
objective response and response duration to patients that had progressed on ipilimumab and for patients with 
BRAFV600 mutation, a BRAF inhibitor. This is a patient population that has few treatment options available. 
Hence, the CHMP considers that efficacy of nivolumab in patients previously treated with BRAFV600 inhibitors 
and/or ipilimumab with unresectable and metastatic melanoma has been demonstrated. Although OS was not 
statistically significant, patients who responded to treatment had a prolonged response which was considered 
clinically meaningful.  In addition, PFS data, although not completely mature (66% of events) suggests a delay 
in the progression of the tumour as compared to chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the benefit is limited to a 
proportion of patients. The challenge remains to identify this patient population that derives the greatest chance 
to benefit from nivolumab,  
Therefore, as there are concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product that have been 
identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, the CHMP considers the 
following measures should be provided as a condition for the marketing authorisation: 
 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): Final Study report for study CA209037: a Randomized, 
Open-Label, Phase 3 Trial of nivolumab vs Investigator’s Choice in Advanced (Unresectable or 
Metastatic) Melanoma Patients Progressing Post Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy. This post-authorisation measure 
is included in the Annex II. 
 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): Updated OS data for Study CA209066: a Phase 3, 
randomized, double-blind study of nivolumab  vs dacarbazine in subjects with BRAF wild type, 
previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. This postauthorisation measure is included 
in the Annex II. 
 
The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of nivolumab should be further explored, specifically: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 101/130 
 
  
  
o  To continue the exploration of the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity based on current assay 
method used to further elucidate its value as predictive of nivolumab efficacy. These analysis 
will be conducted in Studies CA 209037 and CA209066 in patients with advanced melanoma. 
o  To further investigate the value biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status at tumour cell 
membrane level by IHC  (e.g., other methods / assays, and associated cut-offs, that might 
prove more sensitive and specific in predicting response to treatment based on PD-L1, PD-L2, 
tumour infiltrating lymphocytes with measurement of CD8+T density, RNA signature, etc.) as 
predictive of nivolumab efficacy. These additional biomarker analyses are occurring in the 
context of Study CA209-038 and Study CA209-066.  
o  To further investigate at post-approval the relation between PDL-1 and PDL-2 expression in 
Phase 1 studies (CA209009, CA209038 and CA209064). 
o  To further investigate the associative analyses between PDL-1 and PDL-2 expression conducted 
in Study CA209-066. 
o  To further investigate at post-approval the possible change in PD-L1 status of the tumour during 
treatment and/or tumour progression in Studies CA209-009, CA209-038 and CA209-064.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events for Study CA209037 
The frequency of SAEs, regardless of causality, was higher in the nivolumab group (53.0% [33.2% Grade 3-4]) 
vs. the investigator’s choice group (23.5% [16.7% Grade 3-4]). Grade 5 SAEs were reported in 29 (10.8%) 
subjects in the nivolumab group and 3 (2.9%) subjects in the investigator’s choice group. The most 
frequently-reported SAEs (all causality, > 2% of subjects) were malignant neoplasm progression (13.8%), 
pneumonia (2.6%), and back pain (2.2%) in the nivolumab group and malignant neoplasm progression (4.9%), 
vomiting (2.9%), and dyspnea (2.9%) in the investigator’s choice group. The frequency of serious cardiac 
events (all grades) was 4.9% and 0 in the nivolumab and investigator’s choice group, respectively. In the 
nivolumab group, only one (0.4%) subject had a serious cardiac event that was considered by the investigator 
to be related to study drug. 
The only SAE of any grade, regardless of causality, reported by ≥ 2% of subjects treated with nivolumab was 
malignant neoplasm progression (10.1%). 
Serious adverse events for CA209066 
The overall frequency of SAEs was lower in the nivolumab group than in the dacarbazine group (31.1% vs 
38.0%). No individual SAE, except malignant neoplasm progression, was reported with a frequency ≥ 2% in the 
nivolumab group (4.9% vs 8.3% nivolumab and DTIC).

In order to characterize AEs of clinical importance that are potentially associated with the use of nivolumab, 
select AE categories were defined and consistent criteria were applied across the nivolumab clinical development 
program. Select AEs included endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, and rash, 
with the multiple event terms that may describe each of these grouped into endocrine, GI, liver, pulmonary, 
renal, and skin select AE categories, respectively. According to the data submitted, the immunological AEs 
related to nivolumab (pooled studies CA209003, CA209037, CA209063, CA209066) include skin (31.3%), 
gastrointestinal (15.0%) endocrine (7.9%; 7.1% within thyroid disorder subcategory), hepatic (5.1%), 
pulmonary (2.8%), and renal (2.2%) events, with the following terms reported: pruritis (14.9%), diarrhea 
(14.4%), hypothyroidism (4.8%), ALT increased (2.9%), pneumonitis (2.5%), and blood creatinine increased 
(0.9%).

Endocrine Select Adverse Events 
The endocrine select AE category included the following sub-categories: adrenal disorders, diabetes, pituitary 
disorders, and thyroid disorders. In order to monitor for endocrine select AEs in the thyroid disorder and 
diabetes sub-categories, routine testing of thyroid stimulating hormone and blood glucose every 6 weeks while 
receiving nivolumab, was performed.  
Adverse event terms belonging to the endocrine select AE category were reported in 32 (11.9%) of the patients 
in the nivolumab group and in 2 (2.0%) of the patients in the investigator’s choice group. The majority of the 
patients with AEs belonging to the endocrine select AE category were grade 1-2, the only grade 3 AE was a SAE 
of adrenal insufficiency. This AE was considered not related to nivolumab by the investigator. The most 
frequently reported terms (≥2% of the patients), regardless of causality, were hypothyroidism and 
hyperthyroidism in in the nivolumab group. No terms were reported in more than 1 patient in the investigator’s 
choice group.  
The median time to onset of any grade AE belonging to the endocrine select AE category was 8.1 weeks (range: 
0.1 weeks to 46.9+ weeks), while the time to onset of the single grade 3 event of adrenal insufficiency was 2.1 
weeks.  
Of the 32 patients in the nivolumab group who experienced AEs belonging to the endocrine select AE category, 
14 (43.8%) had events that resolved with a median time to resolution of 24.1 weeks. The single grade 3 event 
resolved after 0.6 weeks. Four patients received immunosuppressive medication (systemic corticosteroids) for 
treatment of the AE. 
Table 41: 
Summary of adverse events belonging to the endocrine select adverse event category  
Gastrointestinal Select Adverse Events 
The GI select AE category included the following terms: colitis, colitis ulcerative, diarrhoea, enteritis, 
enterocolitis, frequent bowel movements, and GI perforation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015

Adverse event terms belonging to the GI select AE category were reported in 20.5% of the patients treated with 
nivolumab and in 16.7% of the patients in the investigator’s choice arm. The most frequently reported AE (≥2% 
of the patients), regardless of causality, was diarrhoea in both the nivolumab and the investigator’s choice 
groups. Two of patients in both the nivolumab group and the investigator’s choice group, experienced grade 3 
diarrhoea. In the nivolumab group, two other patients experienced Grade 3 drug-related colitis, which was a SAE 
and led to treatment discontinuation.  
In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset of any grade AE belonging to the GI select AE category was 
6.3 weeks (range: 0.1 to 37.6 weeks), while the median time to onset of the 4 Grade 3 events was 10.8 weeks 
(range: 4.1 to 26.7 weeks). 
The majority (90.9%) of GI AEs resolved. Four of the patients in the nivolumab group were treated with 
immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroid treatment). The median total duration of immunosuppressive 
medication given was 6.1 weeks. For all AEs belonging to the GI select AE category, the median time to 
resolution was 1.1 weeks.

category  
Hepatic select adverse events 
The hepatic select AE category included the following terms: acute hepatic failure, ALT increased, AST 
increased, bilirubin conjugate increased, blood bilirubin increased, gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) 
increased, hepatic enzyme increased, hepatic failure, hepatitis, hepatitits acute, hyperbilirubinemia, liver 
disorder, liver function test abnormal, liver injury, and transaminases increased.  
Adverse event terms belonging to the hepatic select AE category were reported in 10.4% of the patients treated 
with nivolumab and in 6.9% of the patients in the investigator’s choice arm. The most frequently reported AE 
(≥2% of the patients), regardless of causality, were AST increased and ALT increased in the nivolumab group 
and AST increased , ALT increased and GGT increased in the investigator’s choice group. Nine of patients in the 
nivolumab group experienced grade 3-4 AE.  
In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset of any grade AE belonging to the hepatic select AE category 
was 4.1 weeks (range: 0.1 to 23.0 weeks), while the median time to onset of the 4 Grade 3 events was 2.3 
weeks (range: 0.9 to 20.3 weeks). 
In the nivolumab group, 46.4% of the patients experienced a hepatic AE, resolved. Four of the patients in the 
nivolumab group were treated with immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroid treatment). The median 
total duration of immunosuppressive medication given was 7.9 weeks. For all AEs belonging to the hepatic select 
AE category, the median time to resolution was 6.1 weeks for any-grade AEs and 2.9 weeks for Grade 3-4 AEs.

Pulmonary select Adverse Events 
The pulmonary select AE category included the following terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute 
respiratory failure, interstitial lung disease, lung infiltration, and pneumonitis. Pneumonia was not included as a 
term in the pulmonary select AE category because of the high frequency with which it was expected to be 
reported in the study population, especially to describe infectious rather than non-infectious pneumonitis. 
According to the applicant, inclusion of pneumonia as a select AE term would hinder characterization of the true 
frequency of pneumonitis.  
AEs belonging to the pulmonary select AE category were reported in 8 patients (3.0%) in the nivolumab group 
and in no patients in the investigator’s choice group. Pneumonitis was the most frequently reported term in the 
nivolumab group (7 patients, 2.6%). No grade 3 or higher AEs belonging to the pulmonary select AE category 
were reported in either treatment group.  
In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset of any grade AE, regardless of causality, was 8.7 weeks 
(range: 3.6 to 26.0 weeks).  
Pulmonary AEs resolved in fifty percent of the patients treated with nivolumab. Five of the patients with a 
pulmonary AE were treated with immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroid treatment). Four of the 
patients who received immunosuppressive medication the pulmonary AE resolved. The median time to 
resolution among these patients was 3.3 weeks (range: 2.3 to 8.1+ weeks).

The renal select AE category included the following terms: blood creatinine increased, blood urea increased, 
blood urea increased, creatinine renal clearance decreased, hypercreatinemia, nephritis, nephritis allergic, 
nephritis autoimmunune, renal failure, acute renal failure, renal tubular necrosis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, 
and urine output decreased.  
Adverse events terms belonging to the renal select AE category were reported in 18 (6.7%) patients in the 
nivolumab group and 4 (3.9%) patients in the investigator’s choice group. The most frequently reported terms 
(≥2% of the patients), regardless of causality, were blood creatinine increased in the nivolumab group and renal 
failure acute in the investigator’s choice group.  
The majority of the AEs belonging to the renal select AE category were Grade 1-2. Grade 3-4 AEs were reported 
in 4 (1.5%) and 1 (1.0%) of the patients in the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups, respectively. No 
grade 5 renal AEs or AEs leading to discontinuation were reported. 
In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset of any grade AE was 6.1 weeks (range:0.9 to 45.3 weeks), 
while the median time to onset of the 4 Grade 3-4 events was 6.9 weeks (range: 2.1 to 15.4 weeks). 
In the nivolumab group, 61.1% of the patients experienced a renal AE, resolved. Two of the patients in the 
nivolumab group were treated with immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroid treatment). The median 
total duration of immunosuppressive medication given was 2.3 weeks. For all AEs belonging to the renal select 
AE category, the median time to resolution was 5.1 weeks for any-grade AEs and 2.4 weeks for Grade 3-4 AEs.

The skin select AE category included the following terms, blister, dermatitis, dermatitis exfoliative, drug 
eruption, eczema, erythema, erythema multiform, exfoliative rash, palmarplantar erythordysesthesia, 
syndrome, photosensititvity reaction, pruritius, pruritus allergic, pruritus generalized, psoriasis, rash, rash 
erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash popular, rash pruritic, skin 
exfoliation, skin hypopimantation, skin irritation, Steve-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
urticarial, and vitiligo.  
Adverse events terms belonging to the skin select AE category were reported in 96 (35.8%) patients in the 
nivolumab group and 15 (14.7%) patients in the investigator’s choice group. The most frequently reported 
terms (≥2% of the patients), regardless of causality, were pruritis, rash, rash maculo-papular, vitiligo, and 
dermatitis in the nivolumab group and pruritus, rash, rash maculo-papular, and photosensitivity reaction in the 
investigator’s choice group.  
The majority of the AEs belonging to the skin select AE category were Grade 1-2 (95 of 96 patients in the 
nivolumab group and all 15 patients in the investigator’s choice group). For one patient treated with nivolumab 
a grade 3 AE of rash was reported.  
In the nivolumab group, the median time to onset of any grade AE was 4.3 weeks (range: 0.1 to 42.7 weeks).

In the nivolumab group, 45.7% of the patients experienced a skin AE, resolved. Thirty-two of the patients in the 
nivolumab group were treated with immunosuppressive medications. The majority were dermatological 
corticosteroid preparations. Three patients received systemic corticosteroid treatment. The median total 
duration of immunosuppressive medication given was 11.1 weeks. For all AEs belonging to the skin select AE 
category, the median time to resolution was 16.1.

Hypersensitivity/infusion Reactions 
The hypersensitivity and infusion reactions are shown in Table 47. 
Table 47: 
Summary of Hypersensitivity/infusion Reactions 
Deaths 
In CA209037, the total number of deaths in the ORR analysis was 24% vs 25% for investigator’s choice versus 
nivolumab groups; however, with further follow-up, the total number of deaths at the time of the interim OS 
analysis was higher in the chemotherapy group compared to nivolumab (52% vs 44%), which is consistent with 
CA209066 where a greater number of deaths occurred in the dacarbazine group than the nivolumab group (47% 
vs 23%), respectively. 
Of the 119 deaths in the nivolumab group, 113 were due to disease progression, 2 were of unknown causes, and 
4 were due to “other” reasons. In the four patients, in the nivolumab group within the study CA209037, with the 
reason for death reported as ‘other’, the relationship between the use of nivolumab and the cause of death as a 
consequence of cardio-pulmonary AEs, is not clear. Either the use of other treatments before the death 
(trametinib, vemurafenib, chemotherapy, steroids) or the time after the last dose of nivolumab, make difficult 
to reach any conclusion. In the study CA209066, disease progression seems to be the cause of death in 2 out of 
3 patients with the reason for death reported as ‘other’, whereas the history of cardiac disorders seemed to be 
Assessment report

the cause of death in the last one.  For the time being, the relationship between death due to cardio-pulmonary 
AEs and the use of nivolumab has not been demonstrated. 
Laboratory findings 
Study CA209037 
Among all treated patients, any grade shifts from baseline value were reported for selected laboratory tests 
including ALP, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, absolute neutrophils, creatine, haemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, 
and platelet count. Laboratory measurements were recorded regardless of causality and some were correlated 
with reported laboratory-based AEs.  
Hematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed within 30 days of last nivolumab or investigator’s choice dose 
were primarily Grade 1-2 in severity. Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities (haemoglobin, platelet count, 
leukocytes, lymphocytes, and absolute neutrophil count) were less frequently reported in the nivolumab group 
compared with the investigator’s choice group.  
In the nivolumab group, Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities (all decreases) occurred in <15% of the patients, 
with the most frequent being absolute lymphocyte count decreased (23/258 patients, 8.9%) and haemoglobin 
decreased (17/261 patients, 6.5%). 
In the investigator’s choice group, the most frequently occurring Grade 3-4 hematologic abnormalities (>15% 
of the patients) were absolute lymphocyte count decreased (19/99 patients, 19.2%) and absolute neutrophil 
count decreased (21/99 patients, 21.2%).  
Liver Function tests 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups had normal ALP, ALT, AST, and total bilirubin levels during the 
treatment reporting period. In the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups, abnormalities in select liver 
function tests were primarily Grade 1-2 in severity. 
Grade 3-4 increases in liver function tests (ALP, ALT, AST and total bilirubin) were reported more frequently in 
the nivolumab group compared to the investigator’s choice group.

Kidney Function Tests 
In the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups, the majority (83.6% vs 86.5% respectively) of patients with 
at least 1 on-treatment measurement had normal (Grade 0) creatine values during the treatment reporting 
period. The incidence of a 2-grade or greater shift in creatinine elevation was higher in the nivolumab group than 
in the investigator’s choice group (4.3% vs. 2.1%, respectively). 
Thyroid function tests 
In the nivolumab group, a higher proportion of patients with TSH levels ≤ULN at baseline experienced TSH 
elevation (>TSN) compared with the investigator’s choice group (21.2% vs. 5.5.%, respectively). A higher 
proportion of patients in the nivolumab group had at least one on-study elevated TSH and one T3 or T4<lower 
limit of normal (LLN) compared with the investigator’s choice group (11.0% vs. 1.1%).  
The frequency of patients with TSH≥LLN at baseline that experienced low TSH levels (<LLN) was similar 
between the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups (13.1% vs 13.2% respectively), as was the frequency 
of patients with at least 1 on-study low TSH and 1 free T3 or free T4>ULN.

Immunogenicity 
An integrated summary of immunogenicity of nivolumab in treatment refractory solid tumour population from 
studies MDX1106-03, CA209063, and CA209037 is presented in Table 49. 
Table 49: 
Integrated Summary of anti-nivolumab anti-drug antibody (ADA) assessments – 
Studies MDX1106-03, CA209063, and CA209037 
Overall, out of 524 nivolumab treated subjects who had available ADA assessment at baseline and post-baseline 
from MDX1106-03, CA209063, and CA209037 studies, there was detectable neutralising antibodies in 2 (0.4%) 
subjects. Neutralising antibodies were not detectable in subsequent ADA assessments in these patients; one of 
the subjects with neutralising positive ADA was also persistent positive, but subsequent assessment was ADA 
positive with lower titer and undetectable neutralising antibodies. The safety profiles of these 2 neutralising 
antibody positive subjects were no different than those seen in other subjects. There were no acute infusion 
reactions, hypersensitivity events, new or additional AEs observed in subjects with neutralising antibodies. In 
addition, patients with neutralising antibodies continued treatment with benefit from therapy and thus no clear 
association can be established between presence of neutralising antibodies and loss of efficacy.  
In summary, the immunogenic potential of nivolumab was minimal with relatively low titers, low persistent 
positive rates, low incidences of neutralising antibodies and no impact of immunogenicity on safety.  
Safety in special populations 
The safety profile of nivolumab was similar between the subgroups based on intrinsic (race, age, gender) and 
extrinsic (geographical location) factors.  
A summary of adverse events in the elderly population is presented below.

The applicant did not submit studies on drug-drug interaction (see safety discussion). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study CA209037 
The frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug (all grades), regardless of causality, was lower in 
the nivolumab group (12.7%) vs. the investigator’s choice group (15.7%), whereas the frequency of Grade 3-4 
AEs leading to discontinuation, regardless of causality, was higher in the nivolumab group (9.7%) than the 
investigator’s choice group (2.9%). 
The most frequently reported (> 2% of subjects) AEs leading to discontinuation, regardless of causality, were 
malignant neoplasm progression in the nivolumab group (4.5%) and peripheral neuropathy and fatigue in the 
investigator’s choice group (2.9% each). The frequency of cardiac events leading to discontinuation, regardless 
of causality, was 12.7% and 0% in the nivolumab and investigator’s choice groups, respectively. 
The frequency of drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation (all grades) was lower in the nivolumab group 
(4.5%) vs. the investigator’s choice group (10.8%), whereas the frequency of Grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation was higher in the nivolumab group (4.1%) vs. the investigator’s choice group (2.0%). No drug 
related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by > 2% of subjects in the nivolumab group. 
Study CA209066

The overall frequency of AEs leading to discontinuation was lower in the nivolumab group compared with the 
dacarbazine group (6.8% vs 11.7%). Most AEs leading to discontinuation were Grade 3-4. Malignant neoplasm 
progression was the most frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation in both groups and no other 
individual event was reported with a frequency ≥ 2% in either group.  
Post marketing experience 
The applicant did not submit post-marketing experience. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nivolumab was characterized in 3 studies where nivolumab was given as monotherapy: 2 
Phase 3 studies (CA209037 and CA209066) in advanced melanoma and 1 Phase 1b study (MDX1106-03) in 
multiple tumour types, including melanoma. 
The administration of nivolumab is associated with an increase in the rate of fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, 
pruritus, anaemia, cough, rash and dyspnoea. The most frequently reported ADRs of any grade were fatigue, 
pruritus, nausea, diarrhea, and rash. Select AEs on the basis of its mechanism of action and rate of frequency, 
include endocrinopathies, diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, and rash, with the multiple event 
terms that may describe each of these grouped into endocrine, GI, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, and skin select AE 
categories, respectively.  
According to the data submitted, the immunological ADRs related to nivolumab (pooled studies CA209003, 
CA209037, CA209063, CA209066) and identified as important identified risks include skin (31.3%), 
gastrointestinal (15.0%) endocrine (7.9%; 7.1% within thyroid disorder subcategory), hepatic (5.1%), 
pulmonary (2.8%), and renal (2.2%) events, with the following terms reported: pruritis (14.9%), diarrhea 
(14.4%), hypothyroidism (4.8%), ALT increased (2.9%), pneumonitis (2.5%), and blood creatinine increased 
(0.9%). The SmPC section 4.2 and 4.4 and 4.8 contain the recommendations on how to manage the 
immunologic ADRs. There is a lack of information on patients with autoimmune disease and patients already 
receiving systemic immunosuppressants before starting nivolumab. A warning in section 4.4 on special 
population and in 4.5 on the use of systemic immunosuppressants has been included in the SmPC. In addition, 
these populations have been included in the RMP as missing information. 
In the first line setting, the overall frequency of SAEs was lower in the nivolumab group than in the dacarbazine 
group (31.1% vs 38.0%). No individual SAE, except malignant neoplasm progression, was reported with a 
frequency ≥ 2% in the nivolumab group (4.9% vs 8.3% nivolumab and DTIC). The incidence of SAE, adjusted 
by incidence rate per 100 person-years of exposure, balances the groups of the study, with a pretty similar rate 
(156 vs 145 nivilumab and chemo respectively). This fact seems to highlight that the longer exposure could be 
responsible of the higher incidence of SAE in the nivolumab group (44% vs 21.6%). In study CA209037, the 
frequency of cardiac events, regardless of causality, was 12.7% (34 subjects) and 0% in the nivolumab and 
investigator’s choice groups, respectively but was lower in the nivolumab group than dacarbazine group in the 
metastatic melanoma without prior treatment population. All were considered not related to nivolumab by 
investigators except arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmia). Overall, nivolumab 
does not have QT prologation potential in the studied dose range. Therefore, the risk of cardiac arrhythmias has 
been included in the RMP as an important potential risk.  The Applicant plans to conduct a PASS which will 
provide further insight in the safety of nivolumab under clinical practice conditions for use to investigate  
postmarketing use safety profile, management and outcome of immune-related pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, 
nephritis or renal dysfunction, endocrino-pathies, and other immune-related adverse reactions. Details of the 
design of this PASS will be further discussed within 3 months of the EC Decision with PRAC. It is expected data 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 120/130 
 
  
  
from all these studies will be provided as part of the PSURs, which is considered adequate. This is reflected in the 
RMP. 
Regarding deaths, in study CA209037, a total of 119 (44.4%) subjects in the nivolumab group and 53 (52%) 
subjects in the investigator’s choice group died at the time of the database lock for the Interim Ad hoc Report. 
Regarding the profile of deaths during the first 9 weeks, this seems to extend over the first 3months, even 
though disease progression appears to be the cause of the vast majority of deaths in the first 9 weeks (28 deaths 
out of 29 were due to disease progression). Importantly, during the first 3months of nivolumab treatment, a 
higher frequency of death due to malignant neoplasm progression than for the investigator’s choice treatment 
was reported. These results are probably a reflection of worse prognostic factors in the nivolumab arm (brain 
metastases and LDH levels) than in the chemotherapy group in the CA209066 study, a total of 47 (22.8%) 
subjects in the nivolumab group and 96 (46.8%) subjects in the dacarbazine group died prior to database lock. 
The laboratory findings seem to highlight the higher haematological toxicity associated to chemotherapy and the 
higher number of hepatic events grade 3-4 and thyroid test abnormalities related to nivolumab. 
As with any other intravenous administered drugs, infusion-related reactions can occur with nivolumab. Severe 
infusion reactions have been reported in clinical trials (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). This risk has been included 
in the RMP as an important identified risk.  
Nivolumab showed a low immunogenicity potential, overall from the 524 evaluable subjects only 4 (0.8%) 
patients were persistently positive of whom 2 (0.4%) were positive for neutralizing antibodies. There was no 
evidence of acute infusion reactions, hypersensitivity reactions or altered safety profile in patients with 
persistent or neutralizing antibodies. The number of patients tested for ADA was low, therefore, the risk of 
developing ADA was considered not yet been fully investigated. Results will be presented in the final clinical 
study report for each respective study. The risk of immunogenicity has been included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk and is included in the SmPC in section 4.8.  
Like most therapeutic proteins, nivolumab is not metabolised by liver cytochrome (CYP) P450 metabolising 
enzymes or other drug-metabolising enzymes, and is not expected to have an effect on cytochrome P450 or 
other drug-metabolising enzymes in terms of inhibition or induction. In addition, nivolumab treatment did not 
result in any meaningful change in cytokines known to have indirect effect on CYP enzymes across the dose 
range 0.3 to 10 mg/kg. The lack of cytokine modulation suggests nivolumab has no or low potential for 
modulating CYP enzymes and therefore, there is a low risk of a therapeutic protein-drug interaction. Therefore, 
the lack of studies investigating the safety related to drug-drug interaction is acceptable. There is missing 
information for patients below 18 years of age, patients with severe hepatic and/or renal impairment. The 
missing information has been included as part of the RMP and is also described in section 4.2 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The ADRs reported for patients being treated with nivolumab appear to be mostly of low grade and manageable. 
It was noted that immunological ADRs include skin, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hepatic, pulmonary and renal 
events. These are managed appropriately with the recommendations as stated in the SmPC and are also 
addressed in the RMP.  Therefore, the CHMP considers that the safety and tolerability of nivolumab has been 
described appropriately and is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015

The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
 
To generate additional information on AEs of special interest (eg. immune-related pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, nephritis or renal dysfunction, endocrinopathies, rash, and other immune-related adverse 
reactions and infusion reactions) in routine oncology practice during post-marketing use. The study 
protocol will be discussed at PRAC within 3 months after the EC decision. The applicant should submit 
study CA209234, a non-interventional PASS. This post-authorisation measure is included in the RMP. 
The CHMP recommends the following the following measure to address issues related to safety: 
 
To further evaluate the immunogenicity and the impact of ADA on efficacy and safety.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Nivolumab, an antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks binding to the natural ligand PD-L1 and PD-L2, has shown 
superior efficacy compared to dacarbazine in untreated metastatic or unsectable melanoma patients in the 
pivotal phase 3 study CA209066. The trial showed a statistical significant benefit in terms of OS with a HR=0.42 
(99.79%CI: 0.25 – 0.73; p-value <0.0001). The estimated OS rate at 12 months was 73% (95%CI: 9.33 – 
12.09) and 42% (95%CI: 65.5 – 78.9) for nivolumab and dacarbazine, respectively. The secondary efficacy 
endpoint was supportive of the primary analyses: the PFS HR=0.43 (95%CI: 0.34-0.56; p<0.0001) with a 
median PFS of 5.1 months for nivolumab compared to 2.2 month for dacarbazine. The confirmed ORR was 40% 
compared to 13.9% for nivolumab and dacarbazine, respectively. 
The second pivotal study, CA209037, showed a confirmed ORR of 31.7% and 10.6% for nivolumab and 
investigator’s choice, respectively. A descriptive result for PFS highlights a benefit for nivolumab with HR= 0.74 
(95% CI: 0.57, 0.97) for nivolumab over investigator’s choice chemotherapy. The CHMP considered that the 
ORR and PFS data results were clinically relevant for a patient population with advanced disease and which has 
few treatment options. Subgroup analyses for both studies supported the main findings and were consistent 
with regard to the whole study population.  
It is important to note that the study excluded certain patients which had active brain metastases or 
leptomeningeal metastases, ocular melanoma, patients which had known or suspected autoimmune disease and 
patients with conditions requiring systemic treatment with immunosuppressive agents. Therefore, caution must 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/76688/2015 
Page 125/130 
 
  
  
 
be used when treating patients with these risk factors. This is stated in the smPC section 4.4. Moreover, there 
were no patients with BRAF mutated tumours enrolled in this study. However, considering the data from study 
CA209037 and the fact that the mechanism of action of BRAFV600 and PD-1 appear to be independent of each 
other, it is believed that this patient population would still respond and benefit from nivolumab treatment. 
It is of note that for both studies, the benefit of nivolumab was observed regardless of the presence of distant 
metastases and PD-L1 expression. 
Beneficial effects 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is uncertainty in the knowledge of nivolumab in the long term efficacy in previously untreated patients. 
Study CA209066 was stopped early upon the recommendation of the DMC following assessment of the results 
of an unplanned interim analysis. The study was unblinded and patients receiving dacarbazine were allowed to 
cross over to nivolumab treatment, creating a confounding factor for OS. Although there is no concern over the 
validity of the data,  follow up data are required as the OS analysis was based on a small proportion of events at 
the time of this application. This is reflected as a condition in the Annex II.  
Concerning the treatment of previously treated melanoma patients (study CA209037), more mature data are 
required to further describe the clinical benefit of nivolumab treatment. This is reflected as a condition in the 
Annex II. 
The role of the biomarkers PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression as potential predictive or prognostic biomarkers remains 
undetermined. The CHMP has imposed a condition to the marketing authorization in Annex II to perform further 
analyses to ascertain the potential role of the PD-L2 biomarker and other markers, to further explore the 
relationship between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression on the efficacy of nivolumab, to continue the exploration of 
the optimal cut-off for PD-L1 positivity and to further investigate the possible change in PD-L1 status of the 
tumour during treatment and/or tumour progression.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety and tolerability of nivolumab was characterized in 3 studies where nivolumab was given as 
monotherapy: 2 Phase 3 studies (CA209037 and CA209066) in advanced melanoma and 1 Phase 1b study 
(MDX1106-03) in multiple tumour types, including melanoma. The most frequently reported drug-related AEs of 
any grade were fatigue, pruritus, nausea, diarrhea, and rash. Nivolumab is associated with immune-related 
adverse reactions. AEs on the basis of its mechanism of action and rate of frequency included endocrinopathies, 
diarrhoea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, and rash, with the multiple event terms that may describe 
each of these.  
The rate of ADA is very low and does not lead to any concern at this point. However, given the low number of 
ADA positive patients, the risk of developing ADA was not considered as fully investigated. Thus, the CHMP 
recommended to further evaluate the immunogenicity and the impact of ADA on efficacy and safety in patients 
treated with nivolumab (see clinical safety discussion). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
AEs of special interest will be systematically assessed within ongoing and planned studies  (see RMP).

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The two pivotal phase 3 studies comparing nivolumab with dacarbazine or investigator’s choice of treatment in 
a first line and last line patient population, respectively, has shown a convincing clinical benefit of major 
relevance for patients with advanced melanoma. In the first line treatment, nivolumab has shown an important 
clinical benefit with a statistically significant increase in survival of untreated melanoma patients. The data was 
considered robust and clinically compelling. In the last line indication, nivolumba showed a clinically significant 
improvement in overall response rate in patients who had received previous therapy. The toxicity of nivolumab 
was considered manageable. Appropriate wording can be found in the SmPC on the recommendations and 
management of treatment-related immune ADRs and adequate RMP measures have been implemented. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trials CA209066 and CA209037, the benefits of nivolumab treatment in of 
advanced (metastatic or unresectable) melanoma patients outweighed the adverse events. Therefore, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance for nivolumab in the proposed indication is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the risk-benefit balance of Opdivo as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or 
metastatic) melanoma in adults is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing 
authorisation subject to the following conditions:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pyrukynd is indicated for the treatment of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) in adult patients 
(see section 4.4). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. 
To gradually increase haemoglobin (Hb) levels and maximise the effect, Pyrukynd should be titrated 
through sequential doses of 5 mg twice daily, 20 mg twice daily and 50 mg twice daily, with 
sequential dose increases occurring every 4 weeks (see Table 1). Hb level and transfusion requirement 
should be assessed before increasing to the next dose level as some patients may reach and maintain 
normal Hb levels at 5 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily. The maximum recommended dose is 
50 mg twice daily. 
Treatment with Pyrukynd is intended to be long-term. Pyrukynd should be discontinued if a patient 
does not experience an improvement of haemolytic anaemia at the maximum recommended dose, 
based on the totality of laboratory results and clinical status of the patient, unless there is another 
explanation for response failure (e.g. bleeding, surgery, other concomitant illnesses). 
Table 1:  Dose titration and maintenance schedule 
Duration 
Day 1 to Week 4

Week 9 to Week 12 
Dose titration and maintenance 
5 mg twice daily  
All patients: 
• 
If Hb level is below normal range or patient has required a transfusion within 
the last 8 weeks: 
• 
Increase to 20 mg twice daily and maintain for 4 weeks. 
Maintain 5 mg twice daily. 
If Hb level is within normal range and patient has not required a transfusion 
within the last 8 weeks: 
• 
If Hb level is below normal range or patient has required a transfusion within 
the last 8 weeks: 
• 
Increase to 50 mg dose twice daily and maintain thereafter. 
Maintenance 
If Hb level is within normal range and patient has not required a transfusion 
within the last 8 weeks: 
• 
Maintain current dose (5 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily). 
If Hb level decreases, consider up-titration to the maximum of 50 mg twice 
daily as per the above schedule. 
Interruption or discontinuation 
To minimise the risk of acute haemolysis, abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd should 
be avoided. The dose should be tapered to gradually discontinue the medicinal product over a 
1-2 week period (see Table 2). Patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis with 
worsening of anaemia (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Missed dose 
If a dose of Pyrukynd is missed by 4 hours or less, the dose should be administered as soon as 
possible. If a dose is missed by more than 4 hours, a replacement dose should not be administered, and 
the patient should wait until the next scheduled dose. Subsequently, the patient should return to their 
normal dosing schedule. 
Dose adjustments due to adverse events 
If a dose reduction is required for adverse event management and/or tolerability, the dose may be 
reduced to the next lower dose level, 20 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily. 
If a patient needs to discontinue the medicinal product due to an adverse event, the dose taper schedule 
(Table 2) should be followed. In situations where the risk to the patient due to the adverse event is 
greater than the risk of acute haemolysis due to sudden withdrawal of the medicinal product, treatment 
may be stopped without taper and patients should be monitored for signs of acute haemolysis with 
worsening of anaemia. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There are limited data available in elderly patients. No dose modifications are recommended in elderly 
patients (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
There are no data available in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose recommendations can be 
made. 
Renal impairment 
There are limited data available in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. No dose 
modifications are recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2.). 
There are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose recommendations can be 
made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Pyrukynd in children and adolescents less than 18 years old have not been 
established. No data are available. Non-clinical studies in juvenile animals have been conducted (see 
section 5.3). 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Pyrukynd may be taken with or without food. The tablets should be swallowed whole. The tablets 
should not be split, crushed, chewed or dissolved because there are no data currently available to 
support other methods of administration.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Acute haemolysis 
Acute haemolysis with subsequent anaemia has been observed following abrupt interruption or 
discontinuation of Pyrukynd (see section 4.8). Abrupt interruption or discontinuation of treatment with 
Pyrukynd should be avoided. A gradual reduction in dosing rather than abrupt cessation is 
recommended (see section 4.2). If discontinuing treatment abruptly, patients should be monitored for 
signs of acute haemolysis and anaemia which may include among other symptoms and signs: jaundice, 
scleral icterus and dark urine. 
Efficacy across mutation types 
The 2 Phase 3 clinical studies ACTIVATE and ACTIVATE-T excluded patients who were 
homozygous for the R479H mutation or who had 2 non-missense mutations (without the presence of 
another missense mutation) in the PKLR gene. In the Phase 2 clinical study, there were 10 subjects 
with 2 non-missense mutations (without the presence of another missense mutation) in the PKLR 
gene, and 5 subjects homozygous for the R479H mutation. Patients with these mutations are less likely 
to respond to treatment with Pyrukynd (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued if clinical 
benefit is not observed (see section 4.2). 
Drug-drug interactions 
Hormonal contraceptives 
Mitapivat may decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates 
of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) (e.g. ethinylestradiol) (see section 4.5). Women of childbearing 
potential should be counselled regarding the use of additional or alternative contraception methods 
(see section 4.6). 
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Co-administration of specific medicinal products with mitapivat may result in increased risk of 
insomnia or changes in efficacy of mitapivat or changes in efficacy of the co-administered medicinal 
products (see section 4.5). Potential drug-drug interactions should be considered whenever beginning 
or discontinuing treatment with mitapivat or other medicinal products concomitantly administered 
with mitapivat. 
Lactose 
Pyrukynd contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Mitapivat is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Mitapivat 
induces CYP3A4 and may also induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and uridine 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Mitapivat may inhibit CYP3A4. Mitapivat may 
induce and inhibit P-gp (see section 5.2). 
Effects of other medicinal products on Pyrukynd 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
The effect of itraconazole (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 
mitapivat was evaluated in a Phase 1 study. Itraconazole increased mitapivat AUC0-t, AUC∞ and Cmax 
by 4.7-fold, 4.9-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. Increased mitapivat plasma exposures may increase 
the risk of insomnia. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors with Pyrukynd should be avoided 
(see section 4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, patients should be 
monitored for increased risk of insomnia (see section 4.2). 
CYP3A4 inducers 
The effect of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 
mitapivat was evaluated in a Phase 1 study. Rifampicin decreased mitapivat AUC0-t, AUC∞ and Cmax 
by 91%, 91% and 77%, respectively. Decreased mitapivat plasma exposures may reduce the efficacy 
of Pyrukynd. The concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with Pyrukynd should be avoided (see 
section 4.4). If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable, patients should be monitored for 
reduced efficacy of mitapivat. 
Gastric acid-reducing agents 
Mitapivat exhibits pH-dependent solubility (see section 5.2) and coadministration with gastric 
acid-reducing agents (e.g. famotidine) may decrease mitapivat absorption (see section 4.4). 
Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with medicinal products that elevate gastric pH was not evaluated in a 
clinical drug-drug interaction study. If concomitant use of gastric acid-reducing agents is unavoidable, 
patients should be monitored for reduced efficacy of mitapivat. 
Effect of Pyrukynd on other medicinal products 
CYP3A4 substrates 
Mitapivat induces and may inhibit CYP3A4 (see section 5.2) and co-administration with sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. midazolam) may alter systemic exposure of these medicinal products. 
Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of this enzyme was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug 
interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should be 
considered during treatment with Pyrukynd (see section 4.4). If co-administration of Pyrukynd with 
sensitive CYP3A4 substrates is unavoidable, patients should be carefully monitored especially for 
those substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. alfentanil, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, 
ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus). 
Hormonal contraceptives 
Mitapivat may alter the systemic exposure of hormonal contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of 
CYP3A4 (e.g. ethinylestradiol) (see section 4.4) and may affect their efficacy (see section 4.6). 
UGT1A1, CYP2B6 and CYP2C substrates 
Based on in vitro data, mitapivat may induce UGT1A1, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 
(see section 5.2) and may decrease systemic exposure to substrates of these enzymes (e.g. irinotecan 
[UGT1A1]; bupropion [CYP2B6]; omeprazole [CYP2C19]; repaglinide [CYP2C8]; warfarin 
[CYP2C9]). Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with substrates of these enzymes was not evaluated in a 
clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies that are not UGT1A1 substrates or sensitive 
substrates of CYP2B6 or CYP2C should be considered during treatment with Pyrukynd (see 
section 4.4). If co-administration is unavoidable, patients should be monitored for loss of therapeutic 
effect of substates of these enzymes, especially for those with a narrow therapeutic index 
(e.g. irinotecan [UGT1A1]; cyclophosphamide [CYP2B6]; valproic acid [CYP2C19]; paclitaxel 
[CYP2C8]; warfarin, phenytoin [CYP2C9]). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P-gp substrates 
Based on in vitro data, mitapivat may induce and inhibit P-gp (see section 5.2) and may alter systemic 
exposure of substrates (e.g. dabigatran etexilate) of this transporter. Concomitant use of Pyrukynd with 
substrates of P-gp was not evaluated in a clinical drug-drug interaction study. Alternative therapies 
that are not P-gp substrates should be considered during treatment with Pyrukynd (see section 4.4). If 
co-administration of Pyrukynd with P-gp substrates is unavoidable, patients should be carefully 
monitored especially for those substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. colchicine, digoxin). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving Pyrukynd. 
Women of childbearing potential should use contraception during treatment with Pyrukynd and for at 
least 1 month after the last dose. Mitapivat may decrease the systemic exposure of hormonal 
contraceptives that are sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). Additional or 
alternative methods of contraception should be considered. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of mitapivat in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Pyrukynd is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether mitapivat and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Pyrukynd therapy, 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no human data on the effect of mitapivat on fertility. Animal studies have shown reversible 
effects on reproductive organs of males and females (see section 5.3). While taking mitapivat, there 
may be an impact on the ability of a woman and a man to conceive. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pyrukynd has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to 
be cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience insomnia during treatment with 
Pyrukynd (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety evaluation of Pyrukynd is based on experience from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical study of adult patients with PK deficiency who were not regularly transfused 
(ACTIVATE) and a single-arm clinical study of adult patients with PK deficiency who were regularly 
transfused (ACTIVATE-T).

The most common adverse reaction across both studies was insomnia (19.4%) and the most common 
laboratory abnormalities observed were oestrone decreased (males) (43.5%) and oestradiol decreased 
(males) (8.7%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions associated with Pyrukynd as identified in clinical studies of patients with PK 
deficiency are tabulated below. 
Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and frequency: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very 
rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Acute haemolysis 
Abrupt interruption or discontinuation of Pyrukynd can lead to acute haemolysis (see section 4.4). For 
guidance on how to interrupt or discontinue treatment see section 4.2. 
In a Phase 2 study, 2 of 52 patients (3.8%) experienced haemolysis upon sudden withdrawal of 
Pyrukynd, including 1 serious adverse event of acute haemolysis. In both patients who received an 
initial Pyrukynd dose of 300 mg twice daily, a rapid and large Hb increase was observed during the 
first 3 weeks of treatment. This was followed by a sudden discontinuation of Pyrukynd without taper, 
which resulted in acute haemolysis with anaemia. Patients who missed a few doses of Pyrukynd later 
in their treatment course, or for whom the dose was tapered, did not experience events of acute 
haemolysis. 
Changes in sex hormone levels 
Mitapivat is a weak aromatase inhibitor in vitro. In ACTIVATE, 1 of 16 (6.3%) males experienced 
increases in testosterone to above normal levels and 2 of 16 (12.5%) and 9 of 16 (56.3%) males 
experienced decreases in oestradiol and oestrone below the lower limit of normal, respectively. In 
ACTIVATE-T, 1 of 7 males (14.3%) experienced oestrone decrease below the lower limit of normal. 
These changes in hormone levels were maintained throughout the study period. In patients who 
discontinued Pyrukynd at the end of the core period, the hormone changes were reversible. Sex 
hormone analysis in female patients was limited due to physiological variations in hormone levels 
expected throughout the normal menstrual cycle and the various types of hormonal contraceptives 
used by patients. 
Insomnia 
In ACTIVATE, insomnia was reported with a similar incidence between patients who received 
Pyrukynd and patients who received placebo and was reported in 6 of 27 (22.2%) patients in 
ACTIVATE-T. In a Phase 2 study, 5 of 27 (18.5%) patients treated at 50 mg twice daily and 16 of 25 
(64%) patients treated at 300 mg twice daily experienced insomnia during the core period.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In clinical studies in patients with PK deficiency, doses of mitapivat were assessed up to 300 mg twice 
daily. Healthy volunteers received up to 2 500 mg as a single dose and 700 mg twice daily for 14 days. 
One patient in a clinical study took 150 mg twice daily, a dose greater than the recommended dose in 
that study (50 mg twice daily) and did not experience any associated adverse events. 
Patients who received higher than the recommended maximum dose of 50 mg twice daily in clinical 
studies reported adverse events consistent with the safety profile of mitapivat in all patients. 
In case of overdose, patients should be treated symptomatically and provided with appropriate 
supportive measures as needed. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other haematological agents, ATC code: B06AX04 
Mechanism of action 
Mitapivat is a pyruvate kinase activator and acts by directly binding to the pyruvate kinase tetramer. 
The red blood cell (RBC) form of pyruvate kinase (PKR) is mutated in PK deficiency, which leads to 
reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, shortened RBC lifespan and chronic haemolysis. 
Mitapivat improves RBC energy homeostasis by increasing PKR activity. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In healthy volunteers, decreases in 2,3 diphosphoglycerate and increases of ATP concentrations were 
observed after dosing mitapivat to steady state. Changes to these pharmacodynamic markers are not 
considered significant for the assessment of activity in subjects with PK deficiency that should rely on 
clinical parameters only. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Pyrukynd was evaluated in 2 multinational Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with PK 
deficiency: ACTIVATE and ACTIVATE-T. 
Patients with PK deficiency who were not regularly transfused (ACTIVATE) 
The efficacy of Pyrukynd was studied in a multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical study (ACTIVATE) of 80 adult patients with PK deficiency who were not regularly 
transfused, defined as having had no more than 4 transfusions in the 52-week period prior to treatment 
and no transfusions in the 3-month period prior to treatment. Patients were included if they had 
documented presence of at least 2 mutant alleles in the PKLR gene, of which at least 1 was a missense 
mutation, and a Hb concentration less than or equal to 100 g/L. Patients homozygous for the R479H 
mutation or with 2 non-missense mutations (without the presence of another missense mutation) in the 
PKLR gene were excluded because these patients did not achieve Hb response (change from baseline 
in Hb ≥ 1.5 g/dL at > 50% assessments) in the Phase 2 dose-ranging study. Randomisation was 
stratified by average of screening Hb concentrations (< 85 vs ≥ 85 g/L) and PKLR gene mutation 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
category (missense/missense vs missense/non-missense). Following a dose titration period with 2 
sequential steps for dose level increase up to 50 mg twice daily, patients continued on a fixed dose of 
Pyrukynd for 12 weeks. 
Among the 80 patients with PK deficiency, 40 patients were randomised to Pyrukynd. Thirty-five out 
of the 40 (87.5%) patients who received Pyrukynd received an optimised dose of 50 mg twice daily 
following the dose titration period. The median duration of treatment with Pyrukynd was 24.1 weeks 
(range 23.6 to 27.4 weeks). Overall, 30 (75%) patients were exposed to Pyrukynd for > 24 weeks. 
Among the 80 randomised patients, the median age was 32.5 years (range 18 to 78) and 40% were 
male; race was reported in 87.5% of patients including 75% White, 10% Asian, 1.3% Native 
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 1.3% were other races.

During the study, 2 (5.0%) patients in the Pyrukynd arm and 7 (17.5%) patients in the placebo arm 
received transfusions.  
Fifteen of the 16 patients with an Hb response in ACTIVATE continued in a long-term extension study 
and were evaluable for maintenance of response. Thirteen maintained increases in Hb concentration 
from baseline above the response threshold of ≥ 15 g/L at the last available Hb assessment without 
requiring any transfusions. The median duration of response for the 16 patients with Hb response was 
6.9 months (range 3.3 to 18.4+ months). 
Patients with PK deficiency who were regularly transfused (ACTIVATE-T) 
The efficacy of Pyrukynd was studied in a multinational, single-arm clinical study (ACTIVATE-T) of 
27 adult patients with PK deficiency who were regularly transfused. Patients who were regularly 
transfused were defined as having had a minimum of 6 transfusion episodes and a history of 
transfusions occurring on average no more frequently than once every 3 weeks during the 52-week 
period prior to informed consent. There were no limitations on the amount of RBC units received 
during the 52-week period prior to informed consent. Patients were included if they had documented 
presence of at least 2 mutant alleles in the PKLR gene, of which at least 1 was a missense mutation. 
Patients homozygous for the R479H mutation or with 2 non-missense mutations (without the presence 
of another missense mutation) in the PKLR gene were excluded because these patients did not achieve 
Hb response (change from baseline in Hb ≥ 1.5 g/dL at > 50% assessments) in the Phase 2 
dose-ranging study. Following a dose titration period with 2 sequential steps for dose level increase up 
to 50 mg twice daily, patients continued on a fixed dose of Pyrukynd for 24 weeks. 
Among the 27 patients treated, the median duration of treatment with Pyrukynd was 40.3 weeks (range 
16.3 to 46.3 weeks). Overall, 20 (74.1%) patients were exposed to Pyrukynd for > 40 weeks. 
Twenty-five out of the 27 (92.6%) patients who received Pyrukynd received an optimised dose of 
50 mg twice daily following the dose titration period. The median age was 36 years (range 18 to 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
68 years), and 25.9% were male; race was reported in 85.2% of patients including 74.1% White, and 
11.1% Asian. The baseline disease characteristics are shown in Table 6.

2 One patient with ≥ 50% reduction in RBC units from baseline was a non-responder in the analysis of the 
primary endpoint (transfusion reduction response) since they received < 12 weeks of treatment in the fixed-dose 
period. 
All 6 (22.2%) subjects who were transfusion free in ACTIVATE-T remained transfusion free in a 
long-term extension study. The median duration of response for the 6 patients was 17.0 months (range 
11.5+ to 21.8+ months). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pyrukynd in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of PK deficiency (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of Pyrukynd did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to 
determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat have been characterised in healthy adults and patients with PK 
deficiency. Mitapivat is readily absorbed, extensively distributed and exhibits low clearance following 
oral administration. 
Autoinduction of mitapivat clearance was evident upon repeat dosing. 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat showed low to moderate variability in healthy adult subjects. 
Absorption 
Mitapivat was readily absorbed after single and multiple doses both in healthy subjects and in patients 
with PK deficiency. Median Tmax values at steady state were 0.5 to 1 hour post dose across the dose 
range studied (5 mg to 700 mg twice daily). 
The absolute bioavailability after a single dose was approximately 73%. 
Mitapivat exhibits pH-dependent solubility. High solubility is observed up to pH 5.5, with decreasing 
solubility at higher pH which may decrease mitapivat absorption. 
Effect of food 
Following administration of a single dose in healthy subjects, and a high-fat meal (approximately 900 
to 1 000 total calories, with 500 to 600 calories from fat, 250 calories from carbohydrate and 
150 calories from protein) there was no change in AUCinf while mitapivat Cmax decreased by 42%. 
Administration of Pyrukynd with a high-fat meal had no clinically meaningful effect on mitapivat 
pharmacokinetics. 
Distribution 
Mitapivat is highly protein bound (97.7%) in plasma with low RBC distribution. The mean volume of 
distribution (Vz) was 135 L. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies showed that mitapivat is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Following a single oral 
dose of 120 mg of radiolabelled mitapivat to healthy subjects, unchanged mitapivat was the major 
circulating component. 
In vitro drug interaction studies 
Metabolic pathways 
Mitapivat induces CYP3A4 and may also induce CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and 
UGT1A1. Mitapivat may inhibit CYP3A4. 
Drug transporter systems 
Mitapivat is a substrate for P-gp and may induce and inhibit P-gp. 
Elimination 
Mitapivat has a mean t1/2 ranging from 16.2 to 79.3 hours following single oral dose administrations 
(5 to 2 500 mg) under fasted conditions to healthy subjects. Population pharmacokinetics derived 
median CL/F at steady state was 11.5, 12.7 and 14.4 L/h for the 5 mg twice daily, 20 mg twice daily, 
and 50 mg twice daily regimens, respectively. 
After a single oral administration of radiolabelled mitapivat to healthy subjects, the total recovery of 
administered radioactive dose was 89.1%, with 49.6% in the urine (2.6% unchanged) and 39.6% in the 
faeces (less than 1% unchanged). 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The AUC and Cmax of mitapivat increased in a dose-proportional manner over the clinically relevant 
dose range of 5 to 50 mg twice daily in healthy subjects and in patients with PK deficiency. 
Special populations 
No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of mitapivat were observed based on age, 
sex, race or body weight. 
Elderly 
There were 5 patients 65 years of age or older who received mitapivat in the clinical studies 
ACTIVATE and ACTIVATE-T. No differences in the pharmacokinetics were observed in these patients 
compared to younger patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat in patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment have 
not been studied. 
Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on mitapivat pharmacokinetics were assessed as part of the population 
pharmacokinetic analyses. There were 24 patients with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] ≥ 60 to ˂ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 4 with moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 to ˂ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
renal impairment. Steady-state AUC was similar between patients with normal renal function and mild 
renal impairment. Geometric mean for steady-state AUC from the small number of patients with 
moderate renal impairment was higher than that for patients with normal renal function but within the 
range of steady-state AUCs observed for patients with normal renal function (see section 4.2). There 
are no data available in patients with severe renal impairment. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of mitapivat in children and adolescent patients less than 18 years old have not 
been studied. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Mitapivat was not carcinogenic in transgenic rasH2 mice when administered twice daily for a 
minimum of 26 weeks up to the highest total daily dose of 500 mg/kg/day in male mice (6.4-fold 
difference in human exposure) and 250 mg/kg/day in female mice (2.6-fold difference in human 
exposure). 
In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, proliferative and neoplastic lesions were observed in the liver, 
thyroid, ovaries and pancreas. Findings in the liver and thyroid were attributed to CYP enzyme 
induction and were considered rodent-specific. In the ovaries, an increased incidence and/or severity 
of granulosa and/or luteal/granulosa cell hyperplasia was noted at mitapivat AUC0-12hr values 
> 100-fold above the range observed in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) 
of 50 mg twice daily. Benign acinar hyperplasia and adenoma in the exocrine pancreas were observed 
at an increased incidence and/or severity in males from all dose groups (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day): a 
no-effect level was not determined. The incidence of the pancreatic findings was only outside the 
range observed historically in the test strain at 300 mg/kg/day (47-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the 
MRHD). The relevance of the pancreatic findings for humans is unknown. 
Mitapivat was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay. Mitapivat was not 
clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte micronucleus assay nor in an in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay. 
In embryo-foetal development studies, foetal adverse events were observed at AUC0-12 values 63-fold 
(rats) and 3.1-fold (rabbits) above the human AUC0-12hr value at the MRHD. 
In a rat embryo-foetal toxicity study, oral administration of mitapivat was associated with foetal 
adverse events, including a decrease in the mean number and litter proportion of viable foetuses, lower 
mean foetal weights, and test article-related external, soft tissue and skeletal malformations. The 
maternal and foetal no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) occurred at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day 
(13-fold the human AUC 0-12hr at the MRHD). 
In a rabbit embryo-foetal toxicity study, oral administration of mitapivat resulted in lower mean foetal 
body weights. No effects on foetal morphology were observed. The maternal and foetal NOAEL 
occurred at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day (1.5-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the MRHD). 
In rats, mitapivat was shown to induce perinatal mortality in relation to drug-induced 
dystocia/prolonged parturition in both the pre-and post-natal development and juvenile toxicity studies 
at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day (≥ 20-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the MRHD). 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study, oral administration of mitapivat twice daily at 
doses up to 300 mg/kg/day in male rats and 200 mg/kg/day in female rats prior to and during mating, 
and continuing in females through organogenesis, resulted in no adverse events on fertility in male or 
female animals. Reversible findings related to the reproductive organs of males and females were 
observed, which were considered related to aromatase inhibition. In males, reversible microscopic 
findings (degeneration of the seminiferous tubules, spermatid retention, atypical residual bodies in the 
testes, and increased incidence of cellular debris in the epididymides) correlating with abnormal sperm 
evaluation findings (decreased sperm motility and density, increased numbers of abnormal sperm) 
were observed at AUC0-12hr values ≥ 23-fold above the human exposure at the MRHD. In females, 
decreased number of oestrus stages before cohabitation was observed at AUC0-12hr values 49-fold 
above the human exposure at the MRHD, and this change resolved upon cessation of dosing. 
In repeat dose toxicity studies in male and female rats, reproductive organ changes were observed and 
were attributable to aromatase inhibition. In males, lower accessory sex gland weights and higher 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
testis weights, as well as microscopic findings in the testis and accessory sex glands were seen at 
AUC0-12hr values ≥ 4.7 fold the human exposure at the MRHD. In females, higher ovarian weights and 
lower uterus weights, and microscopic findings in the ovary and vagina occurred at AUC0-12hr values 
3.0-fold the human exposure. All findings were reversible. 
In a juvenile toxicology study initiated in rats aged 7 days and treated up to sexual maturity, most 
treatment-related findings were considered related to aromatase inhibition. In males, microscopic 
findings in the testis were observed from the low-dose level of 30 mg/kg/day (1.5-fold the human 
AUC0-12hr at the MRHD) and delayed sexual maturity, abnormal sperm evaluation findings, and mating 
and fertility changes were observed at ≥ 150 mg/kg/day (≥ 22-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the 
MRHD). In females, oestrous cycle changes were observed at the high-dose level of 200 mg/kg/day 
(60-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the MRHD). All evaluable reproductive changes were reversible or 
partially reversible. Treatment-related decrease and increase in body weights were observed in males 
and females, respectively, at ≥ 20-fold the human AUC0-12hr at the MRHD and were not reversed in 
females. Bone changes, including lower bone density and mass, were observed at ≥ 1.5- and ≥ 20-fold 
the human exposure in males and females, respectively. These changes were fully reversible in 
females; in males, they were fully reversible at 1.5-fold the human exposure and partially reversible at 
higher exposure levels.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pyrukynd is and what it is used for 
Pyrukynd contains the active substance mitapivat. 
Pyrukynd is used to treat adults with an inherited condition called pyruvate kinase deficiency. Patients 
with pyruvate kinase deficiency have changes to an enzyme in their red blood cells called pyruvate 
kinase, which result in it not working properly. This leads to the red blood cells being broken down 
too fast, a process known as haemolytic anaemia. 
Pyrukynd helps the pyruvate kinase enzyme to work better. It increases the energy in your red blood 
cells and stops them from being broken down too fast. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about how Pyrukynd works or why 
this medicine has been prescribed for you. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Pyrukynd 
Do not take Pyrukynd  
• 
if you are allergic to mitapivat or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Pyrukynd. 
It is important that you do not stop taking this medicine suddenly because this may lead to worsening 
of your anaemia, with sudden breakdown of red blood cells (acute haemolysis). 
• 
• 
If you want to stop taking Pyrukynd, talk to your doctor first. 
Your doctor will tell you how to stop taking this medicine – usually by reducing the dose 
gradually. This is to prevent any side effects caused by sudden breakdown of the red blood 
cells. 
See section 4 below for more information about these side effects. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. This is because it is not 
known if mitapivat is safe and effective for them.

Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with Pyrukynd.

• 
Talk to your doctor straight away if you become pregnant while taking this medicine. 
Breast-feeding

because it is not known whether the medicine passes into human breast milk or what the effects might

also do this for at least 1 month after taking your last dose. 
While you are taking Pyrukynd, some birth control medicines containing hormones (such as pills) may 
not work as well as expected, meaning you might be at risk of becoming pregnant. Talk to your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse about contraception methods that may be right for you while you are using 
this medicine.

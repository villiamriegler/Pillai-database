Consideration should also be given to official recommendations on intravenous human 
immunoglobulin use in measles pre-/post exposure prophylaxis and active immunisation. 
Immunomodulation in adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery 
to correct the platelet count 
Guillain Barré syndrome 
Kawasaki disease (in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid; see 4.2) 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) 
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
IVIg therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of immune system disorders. 
Posology 
The dose and dose regimen are dependent on the indication. 
The dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the clinical response. Dose 
based on body weight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients.  
The following dose regimens are given as a guidance. 
Replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes 
The dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least 
6 g/l or within the normal reference range for the population age. 3 - 6 months are required after the 
initiation of therapy for equilibration (steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended starting 
dose is 0.4 - 0.8 g/kg given once followed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every 3 - 4 weeks. 
The dose required to achieve a trough level of IgG of 6 g/l is of the order of 0.2 - 0.8 g/kg/month. The 
dosage interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3 - 4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To 
reduce the rate of bacterial infections, it may be necessary to increase the dosage and aim for higher 
trough levels. 
Replacement therapy in secondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1) 
The recommended dose is 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg every 3 - 4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. 
Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase 
- 3 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the 
patient remains infection free. 
Measles pre-/post exposure prophylaxis  
Post-exposure prophylaxis  
If a susceptible patient has been exposed to measles, a dose of 0.4 g/kg given as soon as possible and 
within 6 days of exposure should provide a serum level > 240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at 
least 2 weeks. Serum levels should be checked after 2 weeks and documented. A further dose of 
0.4 g/kg possibly to be repeated once after 2 weeks may be necessary to maintain the serum level 
> 240 mIU/ml. 
If a PID/SID patient has been exposed to measles and regularly receives IVIg infusions, it should be 
considered to administer an extra dose of IVIg as soon as possible and within 6 days of exposure. A 
dose of 0.4 g/kg should provide a serum level > 240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at least 
2 weeks. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis  
If a PID/SID patient is at risk of future measles exposure and receives a IVIg maintenance dose of less 
than 0.53 g/kg every 3 – 4 weeks, this dose should be increased once to 0.53 g/kg. This should provide 
a serum level of >240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at least 22 days after infusion. 
Immunomodulation in: 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia 
There are two alternative treatment schedules: 
• 
0.8 - 1 g/kg given on day 1; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days. 
0.4 g/kg given daily for 2 - 5 days. The treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs. 
• 
Guillain Barré syndrome 
0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse). 
Kawasaki disease 
2.0 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with 
acetylsalicylic acid. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
Starting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. 
Maintenance doses: 1 g/kg over 1 - 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks. 
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, 
the treatment should be discontinued. 
If the treatment is effective, long-term treatment should be subject to the physician’s discretion based 
upon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to be adapted 
according to the individual course of the disease. 
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) 
Starting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. 
Maintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks. 
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 6 months, 
the treatment should be discontinued.

Paediatric population 
Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml is contraindicated in children aged 0 to 2 years (see section 4.3). 
The posology in children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) is not different to that of adults as the 
posology for each indication is given by body weight and must be adjusted to the clinical outcome of 
the above-mentioned conditions. 
Hepatic impairment 
No evidence is available to require a dose adjustment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 
0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min for the first thirty minutes. See section 4.4. In case of adverse reaction, either 
the rate of administration must be reduced or the infusion stopped. If well tolerated, the rate of 
administration may gradually be increased to a maximum of 0.1 ml/kg/min.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance (human immunoglobulins) or to any of the excipients (see 
sections 4.4 and 6.1). 
Hereditary fructose intolerance (see section 4.4).  
In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) may not yet be 
diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicinal product. 
Patients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an 
IgA-containing product can result in anaphylaxis. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Sorbitol 
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless 
strictly necessary.  
Babies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be 
life-threatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an 
overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available.  
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being 
given this medicinal product.  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Precautions for use 
Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: 
- 
- 
are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially administering the product slowly 
(at an initial rate of 0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min) 
are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients 
naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or 
when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the 
first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion in a controlled healthcare setting in 
order to detect potential adverse signs and to ensure that emergency treatment can be 
administered immediately should problems occur. All other patients should be observed for at 
least 20 minutes after administration 
adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the IVIg infusion 
monitoring of urine output 
monitoring of serum creatinine levels 
avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5) 
In all patients, IVIg administration requires: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In case of adverse reaction, either the infusion rate must be reduced or the infusion stopped. The 
treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. 
Infusion-related reaction 
Certain adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, lower back 
pain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate 
given under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully 
observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. 
Adverse reactions may occur more frequently 
- 
in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when 
the human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval 
since the previous infusion 
in patients with an active infection or underlying chronic inflammation 
- 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  
Anaphylaxis can develop in patients: 
- 
- 
with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies 
who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Thromboembolism 
There is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events 
such as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and 
deep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through 
the high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and 
infusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events 
(such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic 
episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods 
of immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, and patients with diseases which increase blood 
viscosity).  
In patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the 
minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. 
- 7 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute renal failure 
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases, risk 
factors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, 
overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65. 
Renal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a 
potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In patients 
at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion 
and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered.  
While reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many 
of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, 
those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In 
patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be considered. 
Flebogamma DIF does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose. 
Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) 
AMS has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The syndrome usually begins 
within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are 
frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly from the 
granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. AMS may occur more 
frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment.  
Patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological 
examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. 
Discontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without 
sequelae. 
Haemolytic anaemia 
IVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo 
coating of red blood cells (RBC) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction 
(Coombs’ test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy 
due to enhanced RBC sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8.). 
Neutropenia/Leukopenia 
A transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been 
reported after treatment with IVIg. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg administration 
and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days. 
Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) 
In patients receiving IVIg, there have been some reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema 
[Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)]. TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, 
dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. Symptoms of TRALI typically develop during 
or within 6 hours after a transfusion, often within 1 - 2 hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must be 
monitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately stopped in case of pulmonary adverse reactions. 
TRALI is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intensive-care-unit management.

Interference with serological testing 
After the administration of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred 
antibodies in the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. 
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D may interfere with some 
serological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coombs’ 
test). 
Transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. 
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped 
hepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses. 
There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 
transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an 
important contribution to viral safety. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the 
name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and 
the batch of the product. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 7.35 mg sodium per 100 ml, equivalent to 0.37% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
Paediatric population 
It is recommended to monitor vital signs when administering Flebogamma DIF to paediatric patients. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live attenuated virus vaccines 
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the 
efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After 
administration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with 
live attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Therefore, patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. 
Loop diuretics 
Avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics 
Paediatric population 
It is expected that the same interactions than those mentioned for the adults may be presented by the 
paediatric population.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled 
clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women. IVIg products have 
been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester.  
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of 
pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are expected. 
Breast-feeding 
The safety of this medicinal product for use in breast-feeding mothers has not been established in 
controlled clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to breast-feeding mothers. 
Immunoglobulins are excreted into human milk. No negative effects on the breastfed newborns/infants 
are anticipated.  
Fertility 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be 
expected. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions, such as 
dizziness, associated with Flebogamma DIF. Patients who experience adverse reactions during 
treatment should wait for these to resolve before driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions caused by human normal immunoglobulins (in decreasing frequency) encompass 
(see also Section 4.4): 
• 
chills, headache, dizziness, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low blood 
pressure and moderate low back pain 
reversible haemolytic reactions; especially in those patients with blood groups A, B, and AB and 
(rarely) haemolytic anaemia requiring transfusion

Description of selected adverse reactions  
The most reported post-marketing ADRs received since the product was authorised for both 
concentrations were chest pain, flushing, blood pressure increased and decreased, malaise, dyspnoea, 
nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, back pain, headache and chills.  
Paediatric population 
The safety results for 29 paediatric patients (those  17 years old) included in the PID studies were 
evaluated. It was observed that the proportion of headache, pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension in 
children was higher than in adults. Assessment of vital signs in clinical trials of the paediatric 
population did not indicate any pattern of clinically relevant changes.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including 
infants, elderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Information on overdose in children has not been established with Flebogamma DIF. However, as in 
adult population, overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity as with any other intravenous 
immunoglobulins.  
5.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, 
for intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of 
antibodies against infectious agents. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is 
usually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donors. It has a distribution of 
immunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.  
Adequate doses of this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the 
normal range.  
The mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but 
includes immunomodulatory effects. A significant increase in median platelet levels was achieved in a 
clinical trial in chronic ITP patients (64,000/µl) although it did not reach normal levels. 
Three clinical trials were performed with Flebogamma DIF, two for replacement therapy in patients 
with primary immunodeficiency (one in both adults and in children above 10 years and another in 
children between 2 to 16 years) and another for immunomodulation in adult patients with immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Human normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient’s 
circulation after intravenous administration.  
Distribution 
It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and extravascular fluid, after approximately 
3 - 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and extravascular compartments. 
Elimination 
Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml has a half-life of about 30 - 32 days. This half-life may vary from patient 
to patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. 
IgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
Paediatric population 
No differences of the pharmacokinetic properties are expected in the paediatric population.

Measles pre-/post exposure prophylaxis (see references)  
No clinical studies have been performed in susceptible patients regarding Measles pre-/post exposure 
prophylaxis.  
Flebogamma DIF 50mg/ml meets the minimum measles antibody potency specification threshold of 
0.36 x Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Standard. The dosing is based on 
pharmacokinetic calculations which take body weight, blood volume and half-life of immunoglobulins 
into consideration. These calculations predict a:  
▪ 
Serum titer at 13.5 days = 270 mIU/ml (dose: 0.4 g/kg) This provides a safety margin more than 
double that of the WHO protective titer of 120 mIU/ml  
Serum titer at 22 days (t1/2) = 180 mIU/ml (dose: 0.4 g/kg)  
Serum titer at 22 days (t1/2) = 238.5 mIU/ml (dose: 0.53 g/kg –pre-exposure prophylaxis)  
▪ 
▪ 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Single dose toxicity studies were carried out in rats and mice. The absence of mortality in the 
non-clinical studies performed with Flebogamma DIF with doses up to 2500 mg/kg, and the lack of 
any confirmed relevant adverse sign affecting respiratory, circulatory and central nervous system of 
the treated animals support the safety of Flebogamma DIF. 
Repeated dose toxicity testing and embryo-foetal toxicity studies are impracticable due to induction of, 
and interference with antibodies. Effects of the product on the immune system of the newborn have 
not been studied.

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
IVIg therapy should be initiated and monitored under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of immune system disorders. 
Posology 
The dose and dose regimen are dependent on the indication. 
The dose may need to be individualised for each patient dependent on the clinical response. Dose 
based on bodyweight may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients.  
The following dose regimens are given as a guidance. 
Replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes 
The dose regimen should achieve a trough level of IgG (measured before the next infusion) of at least 
6 g/l or within the normal reference range for the population age. 3 - 6 months are required after the 
initiation of therapy for equilibration (steady-state IgG levels) to occur. The recommended starting 
dose is 0.4 - 0.8 g/kg given once followed by at least 0.2 g/kg given every 3 - 4 weeks. 
The dose required to achieve a trough level of IgG of 6 g/l is of the order of 0.2 - 0.8 g/kg/month. The 
dosage interval when steady state has been reached varies from 3 - 4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. To 
reduce the rate of bacterial infections, it may be necessary to increase the dosage and aim for higher 
trough levels. 
Replacement therapy in secondary immunodeficiencies (as defined in 4.1) 
The recommended dose is 0.2 - 0.4 g/kg every 3 - 4 weeks. 
IgG trough levels should be measured and assessed in conjunction with the incidence of infection. 
Dose should be adjusted as necessary to achieve optimal protection against infections, an increase 
- 17 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may be necessary in patients with persisting infection; a dose decrease can be considered when the 
patient remains infection free. 
Measles pre-/post exposure prophylaxis  
Post-exposure prophylaxis  
If a susceptible patient has been exposed to measles, a dose of 0.4 g/kg given as soon as possible and 
within 6 days of exposure should provide a serum level > 240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at 
least 2 weeks. Serum levels should be checked after 2 weeks and documented. A further dose of 
0.4 g/kg possibly to be repeated once after 2 weeks may be necessary to maintain the serum level 
> 240 mIU/ml. 
If a PID/SID patient has been exposed to measles and regularly receives IVIg infusions, it should be 
considered to administer an extra dose of IVIg as soon as possible and within 6 days of exposure. A 
dose of 0.4 g/kg should provide a serum level > 240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at least 
2 weeks. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis  
If a PID/SID patient is at risk of future measles exposure and receives a IVIg maintenance dose of less 
than 0.53 g/kg every 3 – 4 weeks, this dose should be increased once to 0.53 g/kg. This should provide 
a serum level of >240 mIU/ml of measles antibodies for at least 22 days after infusion. 
Immunomodulation in: 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia 
There are two alternative treatment schedules: 
• 
0.8 - 1 g/kg given on day 1; this dose may be repeated once within 3 days. 
0.4 g/kg given daily 2 - 5 days. The treatment can be repeated if relapse occurs. 
• 
Guillain Barré syndrome 
0.4 g/kg/day over 5 days (possible repeat of dosing in case of relapse). 
Kawasaki disease 
2.0 g/kg should be administered as a single dose. Patients should receive concomitant treatment with 
acetylsalicylic acid. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
Starting dose:  2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. 
Maintenance doses: 1 g/kg over 1 - 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks. 
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 
6 months, the treatment should be discontinued. 
If the treatment is effective long-term treatment should be subject to the physician’s discretion 
based upon the patient response and maintenance response. The dosing and intervals may have to 
be adapted according to the individual course of the disease. 
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) 
Starting dose: 2 g/kg divided over 2 - 5 consecutive days. 
Maintenance dose: 1 g/kg every 2 to 4 weeks or 2 g/kg every 4 to 8 weeks. 
The treatment effect should be evaluated after each cycle; if no treatment effect is seen after 
6 months, the treatment should be discontinued.

Paediatric population 
Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml is contraindicated in children aged 0 to 2 years (see section 4.3). 
The posology in children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) is not different to that of adults as the 
posology for each indication is given by body weight and must be adjusted to the clinical outcome of 
the above-mentioned conditions. 
Hepatic impairment 
No evidence is available to require a dose adjustment. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment unless clinically warranted, see section 4.4. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.01 ml/kg/min for 
the first thirty minutes. See section 4.4. In case of adverse reaction, either the rate of administration 
must be reduced or the infusion stopped. If well tolerated, advance to 0.02 ml/kg/min for the second 
30 minutes. Again, if tolerated, advance to 0.04 ml/kg/min for the third 30 minutes. If the patient 
tolerates the infusion well, additional increments of 0.02 ml/kg/min may be made at 30-minute 
intervals up to a maximum of 0.08 ml/kg/min.  
It has been reported that the frequency of adverse reactions to IVIg increases with the infusion rate. 
Infusion rates during the initial infusions should be slow. If there are no adverse reactions, the infusion 
rate for subsequent infusions can be slowly increased to the maximum rate. For patients experiencing 
adverse reactions, it is advisable to reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions and limit the 
maximum rate to 0.04 ml/kg/min or administer IVIg at a 5% concentration (see section 4.4). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance (human immunoglobulins) or to any of the excipients (see 
sections 4.4 and 6.1). 
Hereditary fructose intolerance (see section 4.4).  
In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) may not yet be 
diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this medicinal product. 
Patients with selective IgA deficiency who developed antibodies to IgA, as administering an 
IgA-containing product can result in anaphylaxis. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Sorbitol 
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless 
strictly necessary.  
Babies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be 
life-threatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an 
overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available.  
- 20 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being 
given this medicinal product.  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Precautions for use 
Potential complications can often be avoided by ensuring that patients: 
- 
- 
are not sensitive to human normal immunoglobulin by initially administering the product slowly 
(at an initial rate of 0.01 ml/kg/min) 
are carefully monitored for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. In particular, patients 
naive to human normal immunoglobulin, patients switched from an alternative IVIg product or 
when there has been a long interval since the previous infusion should be monitored during the 
first infusion and for the first hour after the first infusion in a controlled healthcare setting in 
order to detect potential adverse signs and to ensure that emergency treatment can be 
administered immediately should problems occur. All other patients should be observed for at 
least 20 minutes after administration 
adequate hydration prior to the initiation of the IVIg infusion 
monitoring of urine output 
monitoring of serum creatinine levels 
avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics (see 4.5) 
In all patients, IVIg administration requires: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In case of adverse reaction, either infusion the rate must be reduced or the infusion stopped. The 
treatment required depends on the nature and severity of the adverse reaction. 
Infusion-related reaction 
Certain adverse reactions (e.g. headache, flushing, chills, myalgia, wheezing, tachycardia, lower back 
pain, nausea, and hypotension) may be related to the rate of infusion. The recommended infusion rate 
given under section 4.2 must be closely followed. Patients must be closely monitored and carefully 
observed for any symptoms throughout the infusion period. 
Adverse reactions may occur more frequently 
- 
in patients who receive human normal immunoglobulin for the first time or, in rare cases, when 
the human normal immunoglobulin product is switched or when there has been a long interval 
since the previous infusion 
in patients with an active infection or underlying chronic inflammation 
- 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  
Anaphylaxis can develop in patients: 
- 
- 
with undetectable IgA who have anti-IgA antibodies 
who had tolerated previous treatment with human normal immunoglobulin 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Thromboembolism 
There is clinical evidence of an association between IVIg administration and thromboembolic events 
such as myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident (including stroke), pulmonary embolism and 
deep vein thromboses which is assumed to be related to a relative increase in blood viscosity through 
the high influx of immunoglobulin in at-risk patients. Caution should be exercised in prescribing and 
- 21 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infusing IVIg in obese patients and in patients with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events 
(such as advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and a history of vascular disease or thrombotic 
episodes, patients with acquired or inherited thrombophilic disorders, patients with prolonged periods 
of immobilisation, severely hypovolaemic patients, and patients with diseases which increase blood 
viscosity).  
In patients at risk for thromboembolic adverse reactions, IVIg products should be administered at the 
minimum rate of infusion and dose practicable. 
Acute renal failure 
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in patients receiving IVIg therapy. In most cases, risk 
factors have been identified, such as pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypovolaemia, 
overweight, concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age over 65. 
Renal parameters should be assessed prior to infusion of IVIg, particularly in patients judged to have a 
potential increased risk for developing acute renal failure, and again at appropriate intervals. In patients 
at risk for acute renal failure, IVIg products should be administered at the minimum rate of infusion 
and dose practicable. In case of renal impairment, IVIg discontinuation should be considered. 
While reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many 
of the licensed IVIg products containing various excipients such as sucrose, glucose and maltose, 
those containing sucrose as a stabiliser accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. In 
patients at risk, the use of IVIg products that do not contain these excipients may be considered. 
Flebogamma DIF does not contain sucrose, maltose or glucose. 
Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) 
AMS has been reported to occur in association with IVIg treatment. The syndrome usually begins 
within several hours to 2 days following IVIg treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are 
frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per mm3, predominantly from the 
granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. AMS may occur more 
frequently in association with high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg treatment. 
Patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms should receive a thorough neurological 
examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. 
Discontinuation of IVIg treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without 
sequelae. 
Haemolytic anaemia 
IVIg products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as haemolysins and induce in vivo 
coating of red blood cells (RBC) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction 
(Coomb’s test) and, rarely, haemolysis. Haemolytic anaemia can develop subsequent to IVIg therapy 
due to enhanced RBC sequestration. IVIg recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of haemolysis. (See section 4.8). 
Neutropenia/Leukopenia 
A transient decrease in neutrophil count and/or episodes of neutropenia, sometimes severe, have been 
reported after treatment with IVIg. This typically occurs within hours or days after IVIg administration 
and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 14 days. 
- 22 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) 
In patients receiving IVIg, there have been some reports of acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema 
[Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)]. TRALI is characterised by severe hypoxia, 
dyspnoea, tachypnoea, cyanosis, fever and hypotension. Symptoms of TRALI typically develop 
during or within 6 hours after a transfusion, often within 1 - 2 hours. Therefore, IVIg recipients must 
be monitored for and IVIg infusion must be immediately stopped in case of pulmonary adverse 
reactions. TRALI is a potentially life-threatening condition requiring immediate intensive-care-unit 
management. 
Interference with serological testing 
After the administration of immunoglobulin the transitory rise of the various passively transferred 
antibodies in the patient’s blood may result in misleading positive results in serological testing. 
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens, e.g. A, B, D, may interfere with some 
serological tests for red cell antibodies for example the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct Coomb’s 
test). 
Transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. 
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens.  
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and for the non-enveloped 
hepatitis A and parvovirus B19 viruses. 
There is reassuring clinical experience regarding the lack of hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 
transmission with immunoglobulins and it is also assumed that the antibody content makes an 
important contribution to viral safety. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the 
name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and 
the batch of the product. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 7.35 mg sodium per 100 ml, equivalent to 0.37% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Post-authorisation Safety Study  
A Post-Authorisation Safety Study suggested a higher rate of infusions associated with potentially 
related adverse events for Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml compared to Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml (see 
section 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
It is recommended to monitor vital signs when administering Flebogamma DIF to paediatric patients.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Live attenuated virus vaccines 
Immunoglobulin administration may impair for a period of at least 6 weeks and up to 3 months the 
efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella. After 
administration of this medicinal product, an interval of 3 months should elapse before vaccination with 
live attenuated virus vaccines. In the case of measles, this impairment may persist for up to 1 year. 
Therefore patients receiving measles vaccine should have their antibody status checked. 
Loop diuretics 
Avoidance of concomitant use of loop diuretics 
Paediatric population 
It is expected that the same interactions than those mentioned for the adults may be presented by the 
paediatric population. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The safety of this medicinal product for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled 
clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to pregnant women. IVIg products have 
been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester.  
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on the course of 
pregnancy, or on the foetus and the neonate are expected. 
Breast-feeding 
The safety of this medicinal product for use in breast-feeding mothers has not been established in 
controlled clinical trials and therefore should only be given with caution to breast-feeding mothers. 
Immunoglobulins are excreted into human milk. No negative effects on the breastfed newborns/infants 
are anticipated.  
Fertility 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects on fertility are to be 
expected. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The ability to drive and operate machines may be impaired by some adverse reactions, such as 
dizziness, associated with Flebogamma DIF. Patients who experience adverse reactions during 
treatment should wait for these to resolve before driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile

Description of selected adverse reactions  
The most reported post-marketing ADRs received since the product was authorised for both 
concentrations were chest pain, flushing, blood pressure increased and decreased, malaise, dyspnoea, 
nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, back pain, headache and chills.  
Paediatric population 
The safety results for 4 paediatric patients (those  17 years old) included in the PID study and the 
results for the 13 children (aged 3 to 16 years old) included in the ITP study were evaluated. It was 
observed that the proportion of headache, chills, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, heart rate 
increase and back pain in children was higher than in adults. Cyanosis was reported in one child but 
not in adults. Assessment of vital signs in clinical trials of the paediatric population did not indicate 
any pattern of clinically relevant changes. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity, particularly in patients at risk, including 
infants, elderly patients or patients with cardiac or renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
- 27 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
Information on overdose in children has not been established with Flebogamma DIF. However, as in 
adult population, overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity as with any other intravenous 
immunoglobulins.  
5.    PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immune sera and immunoglobulins: immunoglobulins, normal human, 
for intravascular administration, ATC code: J06BA02. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains mainly immunoglobulin G (IgG) with a broad spectrum of 
antibodies against infectious agents. 
Human normal immunoglobulin contains the IgG antibodies present in the normal population. It is 
usually prepared from pooled plasma from not fewer than 1000 donors. It has a distribution of 
immunoglobulin G subclasses closely proportional to that in native human plasma.  
Adequate doses of this medicinal product may restore abnormally low immunoglobulin G levels to the 
normal range.  
The mechanism of action in indications other than replacement therapy is not fully elucidated, but 
includes immunomodulatory effects.  
Three clinical trials were performed with Flebogamma DIF, one for replacement therapy in patients 
with primary immunodeficiency (in both adults and in children above 6 years) and two for 
immunomodulation, in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (one in adult patients and 
another in both adults and in children between 3 and 16 years). 
In a Post-authorisation Safety Study that included 66 patients, Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml showed a 
higher rate (18.46%, n=24/130) of infusions associated with potentially related adverse events than 
Flebogamma DIF 50 mg/ml (2.22%, n=3/135). However, one subject treated with Flebogamma DIF 
100 mg/ml presented mild episodes of headache in all infusions and one more patient had 2 episodes 
of pyrexia in 2 infusions. It is worth considering that these 2 subjects contributed to the higher 
frequency of infusions with reactions in this group. There were no other subjects with more than 
1 infusion with adverse reactions in both groups. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Human normal immunoglobulin is immediately and completely bioavailable in the recipient’s 
circulation after intravenous administration.  
Distribution 
It is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and extravascular fluid, after approximately 
3 - 5 days equilibrium is reached between the intra- and extravascular compartments. 
Elimination 
Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml has a half-life of about 34 - 37 days. This half-life may vary from patient 
to patient, in particular in primary immunodeficiency. 
IgG and IgG-complexes are broken down in cells of the reticuloendothelial system. 
Paediatric population 
No differences of the pharmacokinetic properties are expected in the paediatric population. 
- 28 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Measles pre-/post exposure prophylaxis (see references)  
No clinical studies have been performed in susceptible patients regarding Measles pre-/post exposure 
prophylaxis.  
Flebogamma DIF 100 mg/ml meets the minimum measles antibody potency specification threshold of 
0.36 x Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Standard. The dosing is based on 
pharmacokinetic calculations which take body weight, blood volume and half-life of immunoglobulins 
into consideration. These calculations predict a:  
▪ 
Serum titer at 13.5 days = 270 mIU/ml (dose: 0.4 g/kg) This provides a safety margin more than 
double that of the WHO protective titer of 120 mIU/ml  
Serum titer at 22 days (t1/2) = 180 mIU/ml (dose: 0.4 g/kg)  
Serum titer at 22 days (t1/2) = 238.5 mIU/ml (dose: 0.53 g/kg –pre-exposure prophylaxis) 
▪ 
▪ 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Single dose toxicity studies were carried out in rats and mice. The absence of mortality in the 
non-clinical studies performed with Flebogamma DIF with doses up to 2500 mg/kg, and the lack of 
any confirmed relevant adverse sign affecting respiratory, circulatory and central nervous system of 
the treated animals support the safety of Flebogamma DIF. 
Repeated dose toxicity testing and embryo-foetal toxicity studies are impracticable due to induction of, 
and interference with antibodies. Effects of the product on the immune system of the newborn have 
not been studied.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Flebogamma DIF is and what it is used for 
What Flebogamma DIF is 
Flebogamma DIF contains human normal immunoglobulin, highly purified protein extracted from 
human plasma (part of the blood of donors). This medicine belongs to the group of medicines called 
intravenous immunoglobulins. These are used to treat conditions where the body’s defence system 
against disease is not working properly. 
What Flebogamma DIF is used for 
Treatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) who do not have sufficient antibodies 
(Flebogamma DIF is used as replacement therapy). There are two groups: 
• 
• 
Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (PID), an inborn lack of antibodies 
(group 1) 
Patients with Secondary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (SID) with severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure 
(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l (group 2)  
*PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide 
and polypeptide antigen vaccines. 
Treatment of susceptible adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in whom active vaccination 
against measles is not indicated or not advised.  
Treatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) with certain autoimmune disorders 
(immunomodulation). There are five groups: 
• 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition where the number of platelets in the 
blood stream is greatly reduced. Platelets form an important part of the clotting process and a 
reduction in their numbers may cause unwanted bleeding and bruising. The product is also used 
in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count.  
- 50 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Guillain Barré syndrome, where the immune system damages the nerves and hinders them from 
working properly. 
Kawasaki disease (in this case in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid therapy), an illness in 
children where the blood vessels (arteries) in the body become enlarged. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), a rare and progressive 
disease causing limb weakness, numbness, pain and fatigue. 
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a rare disease causing slow progressive asymmetric limb 
weakness without sensory loss. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Flebogamma DIF  
Do not use Flebogamma DIF  
- 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood or have developed 
antibodies to IgA. 
If you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking 
down fructose is not produced. In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary 
fructose intolerance may not yet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this 
medicine (see special warnings about excipients at the end of this section). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Flebogamma DIF. 
Certain side effects may occur more frequently: 
• 
• 
in case of high rate of infusion. 
if you are having Flebogamma DIF for the first time, or it has been switched from an alternative 
human normal immunoglobulin (IVIg) product, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e.g. 
several weeks). You will be watched carefully until an hour after the infusion to detect potential 
side effects. 
Allergic reactions are rare. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of 
the type IgA in your blood or have developed antibodies to IgA. 
Patients with pre-existing risk factors 
Please tell your doctor if you have any other condition and/or illness, as control is required in patients 
with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (formation of blood clots inside your blood). In 
particular, tell your doctor if you have: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
diabetes 
high blood pressure 
history of vascular disease or thrombosis 
overweight  
blood volume decrease 
diseases which increase blood viscosity 
age over 65 
- 51 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with a kidney problem 
If you have a renal disease and you are receiving Flebogamma DIF for the first time, you may suffer a 
problem in your kidneys. 
Your doctor will consider your risk factors and take measures such as to decrease the rate of infusion 
or to stop the treatment. 
Effects on blood tests 
After receiving Flebogamma DIF, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be interfered 
for a certain time. If you have a blood test after receiving Flebogamma DIF, please tell the analyst or 
your doctor that you have been given this medicine.  
Special safety warning 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include: 
• 
• 
• 
careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, 
the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove 
viruses.  
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This applies to any unknown or 
emerging viruses or other types of infections.  
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A and 
parvovirus B19 viruses. 
Immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly 
because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. 
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Flebogamma DIF, the name and 
batch number of the medicine (stated on the label and carton after Lot) are recorded in order to 
maintain a record of the batches used. 
Children and adolescents 
Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate) should be observed 
during the infusion of Flebogamma DIF. 
Other medicines and Flebogamma DIF 
 
• 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  
Effects on vaccines: Flebogamma DIF may reduce the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines 
(live attenuated virus vaccines). In case of rubella, mumps and varicella a period of up to 
3 months should elapse after receiving this medicine and before receiving these vaccines. In 
case of measles, the period is up to 1 year. 
- 52 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should avoid the concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from 
your body (loop diuretics) during treatment with Flebogamma DIF. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment, which might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Flebogamma DIF contains sorbitol 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), 
a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI 
cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.  
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if 
your child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get 
unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. 
Flebogamma DIF contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 7.35 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 100 ml. 
This is equivalent to 0.37% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.  
3. 
How to use Flebogamma DIF 
Flebogamma DIF is given by injection into your veins (intravenous administration). It may be 
self-administered if you have been fully trained by hospital staff or a health care professional. You 
must make up the infusion in exactly the way you have been shown in order to stop germs getting in. 
You must never self-administer it alone; a healthcare professional who is experienced in medicine 
preparation, cannulation, administration and monitoring of adverse reactions must be always present. 
The dose that you will be given will depend on your illness and body weight and will be worked out 
by your doctor (please see section “Instructions for healthcare professionals” given at the end of this 
leaflet). 
At the beginning of your infusion you will receive Flebogamma DIF at a slow rate 
(0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min). Depending on how comfortable you feel, your doctor may then gradually 
increase the infusion rate (up to 0.1 ml/kg/min). 
Use in children of more than 2 years old 
The dose in children is not considered to be different to that of adults as it will be given depending on 
the illness and body weight of the children. 
If you use more Flebogamma DIF than you should 
If you get more Flebogamma DIF than you should, your body may take on too much fluid. This could 
particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems 
with your heart or your kidneys. Tell your doctor immediately.  
- 53 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Flebogamma DIF  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately and follow his/her instructions. 
You must not be given a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Flebogamma DIF should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.01 - 0.02 ml/kg/min for the 
first thirty minutes. If well tolerated, the rate of administration may gradually be increased to a 
maximum of 0.1 ml/kg/min. 
A significant increase in median platelet levels was achieved in a clinical trial in chronic ITP patients 
(64,000/µl) although it did not reach normal levels. 
Paediatric population 
As the dosage for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the 
above-mentioned conditions, the dosage in children is not considered to be different to that of adults. 
Incompatibilities 
Flebogamma DIF should not be mixed with other medicines or intravenous solutions and it should be 
administered by a separate intravenous line. 
Special precautions 
Sorbitol 
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless 
strictly necessary.  
Babies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Flebogamma DIF is and what it is used for 
What Flebogamma DIF is 
Flebogamma DIF contains human normal immunoglobulin, highly purified protein extracted from 
human plasma (part of the blood of donors). This medicine belongs to the group of medicines called 
intravenous immunoglobulins. These are used to treat conditions where the body’s defence system 
against disease is not working properly. 
What Flebogamma DIF is used for 
Treatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) who do not have sufficient antibodies 
(Flebogamma DIF is used as replacement therapy). There are two groups: 
• 
• 
Patients with Primary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (PID), an inborn lack of antibodies 
(group 1) 
Patients with Secondary Immunodeficiency Syndromes (SID) with severe or recurrent 
infections, ineffective antimicrobial treatment and either proven specific antibody failure 
(PSAF)* or serum IgG level of <4 g/l (group 2) 
*PSAF= failure to mount at least a 2-fold rise in IgG antibody titre to pneumococcal polysaccharide 
and polypeptide antigen vaccines. 
Treatment of susceptible adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) in whom active vaccination 
against measles is not indicated or not advised. 
Treatment of adults, children and adolescents (2 - 18 years) with certain autoimmune disorders 
(immunomodulation). There are five groups: 
• 
Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition where the number of platelets in the 
blood stream is greatly reduced. Platelets form an important part of the clotting process and a 
reduction in their numbers may cause unwanted bleeding and bruising. The product is also used 
in patients at high risk of bleeding or prior to surgery to correct the platelet count.  
- 60 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Guillain Barré syndrome, where the immune system damages the nerves and hinders them from 
working properly. 
Kawasaki disease (in this case in conjunction with acetylsalicylic acid therapy), an illness in 
children where the blood vessels (arteries) in the body become enlarged. 
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP), a rare and progressive 
disease causing limb weakness, numbness, pain and fatigue. 
Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN), a rare disease causing slow progressive asymmetric limb 
weakness without sensory loss. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Flebogamma DIF  
Do not use Flebogamma DIF  
- 
- 
- 
If you are allergic to human normal immunoglobulin or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you do not have enough immunoglobulins of the type IgA in your blood or have developed 
antibodies to IgA. 
If you have fructose intolerance, a quite rare genetic condition where the enzyme for breaking 
down fructose is not produced. In babies and young children (aged 0 - 2 years) hereditary 
fructose intolerance may not yet be diagnosed and may be fatal, thus, they must not receive this 
medicine (see special warnings about excipients at the end of this section). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Flebogamma DIF. 
Certain side effects may occur more frequently: 
• 
• 
in case of high rate of infusion 
if you are having Flebogamma DIF for the first time, or it has been switched from an alternative 
human normal immunoglobulin (IVIg) product, or it is a long time since your last infusion (e.g. 
several weeks). You will be watched carefully until an hour after the infusion to detect potential 
side effects. 
Allergic reactions are rare. It may happen particularly if you do not have enough immunoglobulins of 
the type IgA in your blood or have developed antibodies to IgA.  
Patients with pre-existing risk factors 
Please tell your doctor if you have any other condition and/or illness, as control is required in patients 
with pre-existing risk factors for thrombotic events (formation of blood clots inside your blood). In 
particular, tell your doctor if you have: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
diabetes 
high blood pressure 
history of vascular disease or thrombosis 
overweight  
blood volume decrease 
diseases which increase blood viscosity 
age over 65 
- 61 - 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with a kidney problem 
If you have a renal disease and you are receiving Flebogamma DIF for the first time, you may suffer a 
problem in your kidneys. 
Your doctor will consider your risk factors and take measures such as to decrease the rate of infusion 
or to stop the treatment. 
Effects on blood tests 
After receiving Flebogamma DIF, the results of certain blood tests (serological tests) may be interfered 
for a certain time. If you have a blood test after receiving Flebogamma DIF, please tell the analyst or 
your doctor that you have been given this medicine. 
Special safety warning 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include: 
• 
• 
• 
careful selection of blood and plasma donors to make sure those at risk of carrying infections 
are excluded, 
the testing of each donation and pools of plasma for signs of virus/infections, 
the inclusion of steps in the processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove 
viruses.  
Despite these measures, when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the 
possibility of passing on infection cannot be totally excluded. This applies to any unknown or 
emerging viruses or other types of infections.  
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A and 
parvovirus B19 viruses. 
Immunoglobulins have not been associated with hepatitis A or parvovirus B19 infections possibly 
because the antibodies against these infections, which are contained in the product, are protective. 
It is strongly recommended that every time you receive a dose of Flebogamma DIF, the name and 
batch number of the medicine (stated on the label and carton after Lot) are recorded in order to 
maintain a record of the batches used. 
Children and adolescents 
Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate) should be observed 
during the infusion of Flebogamma DIF. 
Other medicines and Flebogamma DIF 
 
• 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  
Effects on vaccines: Flebogamma DIF may reduce the effectiveness of certain types of vaccines 
(live attenuated virus vaccines). In case of rubella, mumps and varicella a period of up to 
3 months should elapse after receiving this medicine and before receiving these vaccines. In 
case of measles, the period is up to 1 year. 
- 62 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You should avoid the concomitant use of medicines that increase the excretion of water from 
your body (loop diuretics) during treatment with Flebogamma DIF. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Patients may experience reactions (for example dizziness or nausea) during treatment, which might 
affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Flebogamma DIF contains sorbitol 
Sorbitol is a source of fructose. If you (or your child) have hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), 
a rare genetic disorder, you (or your child) must not receive this medicine. Patients with HFI 
cannot break down fructose, which may cause serious side effects.  
You must tell your doctor before receiving this medicine if you (or your child) have HFI or if 
your child can no longer take sweet foods or drinks because they feel sick, vomit or get 
unpleasant effects such as bloating, stomach cramps or diarrhoea. 
Flebogamma DIF contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 7.35 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in 100 ml. 
This is equivalent to 0.37% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use Flebogamma DIF 
Flebogamma DIF is given by injection into your veins (intravenous administration). It may be 
self-administered if you have been fully trained by hospital staff or a health care professional. You 
must make up the infusion in exactly the way you have been shown in order to stop germs getting in. 
You must never self-administer it alone; a healthcare professional who is experienced in medicine 
preparation, cannulation, administration and monitoring of adverse reactions must be always present. 
The dose that you will be given will depend on your illness and body weight and will be worked out 
by your doctor (please see section “Instructions for healthcare professionals” given at the end of this 
leaflet). 
At the beginning of your infusion you will receive Flebogamma DIF at a slow rate (0.01 ml/kg/min). 
Depending on how comfortable you feel, your doctor may then gradually increase the infusion rate (up 
to 0.08 ml/kg/min). 
Use in children of more than 2 years old 
The dose in children is not considered to be different to that of adults as it will be given depending on 
the illness and body weight of the children. 
If you use more Flebogamma DIF than you should 
If you get more Flebogamma DIF than you should, your body may take on too much fluid. This could 
particularly happen when you are a patient at risk, e.g. an elderly patient or a patient having problems 
with your heart or your kidneys. Tell your doctor immediately.  
- 63 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Flebogamma DIF  
Tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately and follow his/her instructions. 
You must not be given a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

In addition to maintenance therapy, 
given as an extra dose within 6 days 
of exposure 
If a patient receives a maintenance 
dose of less than 0.53 g/kg every 
3 - 4 weeks, this dose should be 
increased once to at least 0.53 g/kg 
on day 1, possibly repeated once

Flebogamma DIF should be infused intravenously at an initial rate of 0.01 ml/kg/min for the first 
thirty minutes. If tolerated, advance to 0.02 ml/kg/min for the second 30 minutes. Again, if tolerated, 
- 68 - 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
advance to 0.04 ml/kg/min for the third 30 minutes. If the patient tolerates the infusion well, additional 
increments of 0.02 ml/kg/min may be made at 30-minute intervals up to a maximum of 
0.08 ml/kg/min.  
It has been reported that the frequency of adverse reactions to IVIg increases with the infusion rate. 
Infusion rates during the initial infusions should be slow. If there are no adverse reactions, the infusion 
rate for subsequent infusions can be slowly increased to the maximum rate. For patients experiencing 
adverse reactions, it is advisable to reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions and limit the 
maximum rate to 0.04 ml/kg/min, or administer IVIg at a 5% concentration. 
Paediatric population 
As the dosage for each indication is given by body weight and adjusted to the clinical outcome of the 
above-mentioned conditions, the dosage in children is not considered to be different to that of adults. 
Incompatibilities 
Flebogamma DIF should not be mixed with other medicines or intravenous solutions and it should be 
administered by a separate intravenous line. 
Special precautions 
Sorbitol 
Patients with rare hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless 
strictly necessary.  
Babies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be 
life-threatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an 
overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are available.  
A detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being 
given this medicinal product.  
It is strongly recommended that every time that Flebogamma DIF is administered to a patient, the 
name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and 
the batch of the product. 
Instructions for handling and disposal 
The product should be brought at room temperature (no more than 30 ºC) before use. 
The solution should be clear or slightly opalescent. Do not use Flebogamma DIF if you notice that the 
solution is cloudy or has deposits. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

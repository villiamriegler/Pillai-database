4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
TOBI Podhaler is indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic pulmonary infection due to 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults and children aged 6 years and older with cystic fibrosis. 
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 regarding data in different age groups. 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The dose of TOBI Podhaler is the same for all patients within the approved age range, regardless of 
age or weight. The recommended dose is 112 mg tobramycin (4 x 28 mg capsules), administered twice 
daily for 28 days. TOBI Podhaler is taken in alternating cycles of 28 days on treatment followed by 
28 days off treatment. The two doses (of 4 capsules each) should be inhaled as close as possible to 
12 hours apart and not less than 6 hours apart. 
Missed doses 
In case of missed dose with at least 6 hours until the next dose, the patient should take the dose as soon 
as possible. Otherwise, the patient should wait for the next dose and not inhale more capsules to make 
up for the missed dose. 
Duration of treatment 
Treatment with TOBI Podhaler should be continued on a cyclical basis for as long as the physician 
considers the patient is gaining clinical benefit from the treatment with TOBI Podhaler. If clinical 
deterioration of pulmonary status is evident, additional or alternative anti-pseudomonal therapy should 
be considered. See also information on clinical benefit and tolerability in sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
There are insufficient data in this population to support a recommendation for or against dose 
adjustment.

Renal impairment 
Tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine and renal function is expected to affect the 
exposure to tobramycin. Patients with serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or more and blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN) 40 mg/dl or more have not been included in clinical studies and there are no data in this 
population to support a recommendation for or against dose adjustment with TOBI Podhaler. Caution 
should be exercised when prescribing TOBI Podhaler to patients with known or suspected renal 
dysfunction. 
Please also refer to nephrotoxicity information in section 4.4. 
Hepatic impairment 
No studies have been performed on patients with hepatic impairment. As tobramycin is not 
metabolised, an effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure to tobramycin is not expected. 
Patients after organ transplantation 
Adequate data do not exist for the use of TOBI Podhaler in patients after organ transplantation. No 
recommendation for or against dose adjustment can be made for patients after organ transplantation. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of TOBI Podhaler in children aged under 6 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Inhalation use. 
TOBI Podhaler is administered by inhalation using the Podhaler device (see section 6.6 for detailed 
instructions for use). It must not be administered by any other route or using any other inhaler. 
Caregivers should provide assistance to children starting TOBI Podhaler treatment, particularly those 
aged 10 years or younger, and should continue to supervise them until they are able to use the 
Podhaler device properly without help. 
TOBI Podhaler capsules must not be swallowed. Each TOBI Podhaler capsule should be inhaled with 
two breath-hold manoeuvres and checked to ensure it is empty. 
Where patients are receiving several different inhaled medicinal products and chest physiotherapy, it is 
recommended that TOBI Podhaler is taken last. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance and any aminoglycoside, or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Ototoxicity 
Ototoxicity, manifested as both auditory toxicity (hearing loss) and vestibular toxicity, has been 
reported with parenteral aminoglycosides. Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo, ataxia or 
dizziness. Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity, and therefore the onset of this symptom 
warrants caution. 
Hearing loss and tinnitus were reported by patients in the TOBI Podhaler clinical studies (see 
section 4.8). Caution should be exercised when prescribing TOBI Podhaler to patients with known or 
suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with any evidence of auditory dysfunction, or those with a predisposing risk, it may be 
necessary to consider audiological assessment before initiating TOBI Podhaler therapy. 
Risk of ototoxicity due to mitochondrial DNA variants 
Cases  of ototoxicity with aminoglycosides have been observed in patients with certain variants in the 
mitochondrially encoded 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1), particularly the m.1555A>G variant. 
Ototoxicity occurred in some patients even when their aminoglycoside serum levels were within the 
recommended range. In case of known maternal history of ototoxicity due to aminoglycoside use or a 
known mitochondrial DNA variant in the patient, it may be necessary to consider alternative 
treatments other than aminoglycosides  unless the increased risk of permanent hearing loss is 
outweighed by the severity of infection and lack of safe and effective alternative therapies. 
If a patient reports tinnitus or hearing loss during TOBI Podhaler therapy the physician should 
consider referring them for audiological assessment. 
See also “Monitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations” below. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Nephrotoxicity has been reported with the use of parenteral aminoglycosides. Nephrotoxicity was not 
observed during TOBI Podhaler clinical studies. Caution should be exercised when prescribing TOBI 
Podhaler to patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction. Baseline renal function should be 
assessed. Urea and creatinine levels should be reassessed after every 6 complete cycles of TOBI 
Podhaler therapy. 
See also section 4.2 and “Monitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations” below. 
Monitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations 
Patients with known or suspected auditory or renal dysfunction should be monitored for serum 
tobramycin concentrations. If oto- or nephrotoxicity occurs in a patient receiving TOBI Podhaler, 
tobramycin therapy should be discontinued until serum concentration falls below 2 µg/ml. 
Serum concentrations greater than 12 µg/ml are associated with tobramycin toxicity and treatment 
should be discontinued if concentrations exceed this level. 
The serum concentration of tobramycin should only be monitored through validated methods. Finger 
prick blood sampling is not recommended due to the risk of contamination of the sample. 
Bronchospasm 
Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of medicinal products and has been reported with TOBI 
Podhaler in clinical studies. Bronchospasm should be treated as medically appropriate. 
The first dose of TOBI Podhaler should be given under supervision, after using a bronchodilator if this 
is part of the current regimen for the patient. FEV1 should be measured before and after inhalation of 
TOBI Podhaler. 
If there is evidence of therapy-induced bronchospasm, the physician should carefully evaluate whether 
the benefits of continued use of TOBI Podhaler outweigh the risks to the patient. If an allergic 
response is suspected, TOBI Podhaler should be discontinued. 
Cough 
Cough was reported with use of TOBI Podhaler in clinical studies. Based on clinical trial data the 
inhalation powder TOBI Podhaler was associated with a higher reported rate of cough compared with 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tobramycin nebuliser solution (TOBI). Cough was not related to bronchospasm. Children below the 
age of 13 years may be more likely to cough when treated with TOBI Podhaler compared with older 
subjects. 
If there is evidence of continued therapy-induced cough with TOBI Podhaler, the physician should 
consider whether an approved tobramycin nebuliser solution should be used as an alternative 
treatment. Should cough remain unchanged, other antibiotics should be considered. 
Haemoptysis 
Haemoptysis is a complication in cystic fibrosis and is more frequent in adults. Patients with 
haemoptysis (>60 ml) were excluded from the clinical studies so no data exist on the use of TOBI 
Podhaler in these patients. This should be taken into account before prescribing TOBI Podhaler, 
considering the inhalation powder TOBI Podhaler was associated with a higher rate of cough (see 
above). The use of TOBI Podhaler in patients with clinically significant haemoptysis should be 
undertaken or continued only if the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the risks of 
inducing further haemorrhage. 
Other precautions 
Patients receiving concomitant parenteral aminoglycoside therapy (or any medication affecting renal 
excretion, such as diuretics) should be monitored as clinically appropriate taking into account the risk 
of cumulative toxicity. This includes monitoring of serum concentrations of tobramycin. In patients 
with a predisposing risk due to previous prolonged, systemic aminoglycoside therapy it may be 
necessary to consider renal and audiological assessment before initiating TOBI Podhaler therapy. 
See also “Monitoring of serum tobramycin concentrations” above. 
Caution should be exercised when prescribing TOBI Podhaler to patients with known or suspected 
neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Aminoglycosides may 
aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare-like effect on neuromuscular function. 
The development of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa and superinfection with other pathogens 
represent potential risks associated with antibiotic therapy. In clinical studies, some patients on TOBI 
Podhaler therapy showed an increase in aminoglycoside minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for 
P. aeruginosa isolates tested. MIC increases observed were in large part reversible during off-
treatment periods. 
There is a theoretical risk that patients being treated with TOBI Podhaler may develop P. aeruginosa 
isolates resistant to intravenous tobramycin over time (see section 5.1). Development of resistance 
during inhaled tobramycin therapy could limit treatment options during acute exacerbations; this 
should be monitored. 
Data in different age groups 
In a 6-month (3 treatment cycles) study of TOBI Podhaler versus tobramycin nebuliser solution, which 
included a majority of tobramycin-experienced adult patients with chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa 
infection, the suppression of sputum P. aeruginosa density was similar across age groups in both 
arms; however the increase from baseline FEV1 was larger in younger age groups (6 - <20) than in the 
adult subgroup (20 years and older) in both arms. See also section 5.1 for the profile of response of 
TOBI Podhaler compared to tobramycin nebuliser solution. Adult patients tended to discontinue more 
frequently for tolerability reasons with TOBI Podhaler than with the nebuliser solution. See also 
section 4.8. 
If clinical deterioration of pulmonary status is evident, additional or alternative anti-pseudomonal 
therapy should be considered. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Observed benefits on lung function and P. aeruginosa suppression should be assessed  in the context of 
the patient’s tolerance of TOBI Podhaler. 
Safety and efficacy have not been studied in patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second 
(FEV1) <25% or >80% predicted, or patients colonised with Burkholderia cepacia. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed with TOBI Podhaler. Based on the interaction profile for 
tobramycin following intravenous and aerosolised administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of 
TOBI Podhaler is not recommended with other medicinal products with nephrotoxic or ototoxic 
potential. 
Concomitant use of TOBI Podhaler with diuretic compounds (such as ethacrynic acid, furosemide, 
urea or intravenous mannitol) is not recommended. Such coumpounds can enhance aminoglycoside 
toxicity by altering antibiotic concentrations in serum and tissue. 
See also information on previous and concomitant use of systemic aminoglycosides and diuretics in 
section 4.4. 
Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterally 
administered aminoglycosides include: 
- 
amphotericin B, cefalotin, ciclosporin, tacrolimus, polymyxins (risk of increased 
nephrotoxicity); 
platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity); 
anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects). 
- 
- 
In clinical studies, patients receiving TOBI Podhaler continued to take dornase alfa, bronchodilators, 
inhaled corticosteroids and macrolides, no evidence of drug interactions with these medicines was 
identified. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of tobramycin via inhalation in pregnant women. Animal studies 
with tobramycin do not indicate a teratogenic effect (see section 5.3). However, aminoglycosides can 
cause foetal harm (e.g. congenital deafness) when high systemic concentrations are achieved in a 
pregnant woman. Systemic exposure following inhalation of TOBI Podhaler is very low, however 
TOBI Podhaler should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, i.e. when the benefits to 
the mother outweigh the risks to the foetus. Patients who use TOBI Podhaler during pregnancy, or 
become pregnant while taking TOBI Podhaler, should be informed of the potential hazard to the 
foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
Tobramycin is excreted in human breast milk after systemic administration. The amount of tobramycin 
excreted in human breast milk after administration by inhalation is not known, though it is estimated 
to be very low considering the low systemic exposure. Because of the potential for ototoxicity and 
nephrotoxicity in infants, a decision should be made whether to terminate breast-feeding or 
discontinue treatment with TOBI Podhaler, taking into account the importance of the treatment to the 
mother. 
Fertility 
No effect on male or female fertility was observed in animal studies after subcutaneous administration 
(see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
TOBI Podhaler has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in the main safety, active-controlled clinical study 
with TOBI Podhaler versus tobramycin nebuliser solution in cystic fibrosis patients with P. 
aeruginosa infection were cough, productive cough, pyrexia, dyspnoea, oropharyngeal pain, 
dysphonia and haemoptysis. 
In the placebo-controlled study with TOBI Podhaler, the adverse reactions for which reported 
frequency was higher with TOBI Podhaler than with placebo were pharyngolaryngeal pain, dysgeusia 
and dysphonia. 
The vast majority of adverse reactions reported with TOBI Podhaler were mild or moderate, and 
severity did not appear to differ between cycles or between the entire study and on-treatment periods. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Adverse drug reactions in Table 1 are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within 
each system organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent 
reactions first. Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug 
reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 
to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not 
known: frequency cannot be estimated from the available data. 
The frequencies in Table 1 are based on the reporting rates from the active-controlled study.

Not known 
Cough was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in both clinical studies. However, no 
association was observed in either clinical study between the incidence of bronchospasm and cough 
events. 
In the active-controlled study, audiology testing was performed in selected centres accounting for 
about a quarter of the study population. Four patients in the TOBI Podhaler treatment group 
experienced significant decreases in hearing which were transient in three patients and persistent in 
one case. 
In the active-controlled open-label study, patients aged 20 years and older tended to discontinue more 
frequently with TOBI Podhaler than with the nebuliser solution; discontinuations due to adverse 
events accounted for about half of the discontinuations with each formulation. In children under 
13 years of age, discontinuations were more frequent in the TOBI nebuliser solution arm whereas in 
patients aged 13 to 19, discontinuation rates with both formulations were similar. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Adverse reactions specifically associated with overdose of TOBI Podhaler have not been identified. 
The maximum tolerated daily dose of TOBI Podhaler has not been established. Tobramycin serum 
concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage. In case of signs of acute toxicity, immediate 
withdrawal of TOBI Podhaler and testing of renal function are recommended. In the event of 
accidental oral ingestion of TOBI Podhaler capsules, toxicity is unlikely as tobramycin is poorly 
absorbed from an intact gastrointestinal tract. Haemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin 
from the body.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use, Aminoglycoside antibacterials, ATC 
Code: J01GB01 
Mechanism of action 
Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius. It acts primarily 
by disrupting protein synthesis leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption 
of the cell envelope and eventual cell death. It is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly 
greater than inhibitory concentrations. 
Breakpoints 
Established susceptibility breakpoints for parenteral administration of tobramycin are inappropriate in 
the aerosolised administration of the medicinal product. 
Sputum from cystic fibrosis exhibits an inhibitory action on the local biological activity of inhaled 
aminoglycosides. This necessitates sputum concentrations of tobramycin after inhalation to be about 
ten-fold above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or higher for P. aeruginosa suppression. 
In the active-controlled study, at least 89% of patients had P. aeruginosa isolates with MICs at least 
15 times lower than mean post-dose sputum concentration, both at baseline and at the end of the third 
active treatment cycle. 
Susceptibility 
In the absence of conventional susceptibility breakpoints for the inhaled route of administration, 
caution must be exercised in defining organisms as susceptible or insusceptible to inhaled tobramycin. 
The clinical significance of changes in MICs of tobramycin for P. aeruginosa has not been clearly 
established in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients. Clinical studies with inhaled tobramycin 
solution (TOBI) have shown a small increase in tobramycin, amikacin and gentamicin Minimum 
Inhibitory Concentrations for P. aeruginosa isolates tested. In the open label extensions, each 
additional 6 months of treatment resulted in incremental increases similar in magnitude to that 
observed in the 6 months of placebo-controlled studies. 
Resistance to tobramycin involves different mechanisms. The main resistance mechanisms are drug 
efflux and drug inactivation by modifying enzymes. The unique characteristics of chronic P. 
aeruginosa infections in CF patients, such as anaerobic conditions and high frequency of genetic 
mutations, may also be important factors for reduced susceptibility of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. 
Based upon in vitro data and/or clinical trial experience, the organisms associated with pulmonary 
infections in CF may be expected to respond to TOBI Podhaler therapy as follows: 
Susceptible 
Insusceptible 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Haemophilus influenzae 
Staphylococcus aureus 
Burkholderia cepacia 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 
Alcaligenes xylosoxidans 
Clinical experience 
The TOBI Podhaler Phase III clinical development programme consisted of two studies and 
612 treated patients with a clinical diagnosis of CF, confirmed by quantitative pilocarpine 
iontophoresis sweat chloride test or well-characterised disease causing mutations in each cystic 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, or abnormal nasal transepithelial potential difference 
characteristic of CF. 
In the placebo controlled study, patients were aged 6 - ≤22 years with an FEV1 at screening of between 
25% and 84% of predicted normal values for their age, sex and height based upon Knudson criteria. In 
the active controlled studies, all patients were aged >6years old (range 6-66 years) with an FEV1 % 
predicted at screening of between 24% and 76%. In addition, all patients were infected with P. 
aeruginosa as demonstrated by a positive sputum or throat culture (or bronchoalveolar lavage) within 
6 months prior to screening, and also in a sputum culture taken at the screening visit. 
In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, TOBI Podhaler 112 mg (4 x 
28 mg capsules) was administered twice daily, for three cycles of 28 days on-treatment and 28 days 
off-treatment (a total treatment period of 24 weeks). Patients who were randomised to the placebo 
treatment group received placebo during the first treatment cycle and TOBI Podhaler in the subsequent 
two cycles. Patients in this study had no exposure to inhaled tobramycin for at least 4 months prior to 
study start. 
TOBI Podhaler significantly improved lung function compared with placebo, as shown by the relative 
increase in percent predicted FEV1 of about 13% after 28 days of treatment. The improvements in lung 
function achieved during the first treatment cycle were maintained during the two subsequent cycles of 
treatment with TOBI Podhaler. 
When patients in the placebo treatment group were switched from placebo to TOBI Podhaler at the 
start of the second treatment cycle, they experienced a similar improvement from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1. Treatment with TOBI Podhaler for 28 days resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in P. aeruginosa sputum density (mean difference with placebo about 2.70 log10 in colony 
forming units/CFUs). 
In a second open-label, multicentre study, patients received treatment with either TOBI Podhaler 
(112 mg) or tobramycin 300 mg/5 ml nebuliser solution (TOBI), administered twice daily for three 
cycles. A majority of the patients were tobramycin-experienced adults with chronic pulmonary P. 
aeruginosa infection. 
Treatment with both TOBI Podhaler and tobramycin 300 mg/5 ml nebuliser solution (TOBI) resulted 
in relative increases from baseline to day 28 of the third treatment cycle in percent predicted FEV1 of 
5.8% and 4.7%, respectively. The improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was numerically greater in 
the TOBI Podhaler treatment group and was statistically non-inferior to TOBI nebuliser solution. 
Although the magnitude of improvements in lung function was smaller in this study, this is explained 
by the previous exposure of this patient population to treatment with inhaled tobramycin. Over half of 
the patients in both the TOBI Podhaler and TOBI nebuliser solution treatment groups received new 
(additional) anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (64.9% and 54.5% respectively, the difference consisting 
mainly of oral ciprofloxacin use). The proportions of patients requiring hospitalisation for respiratory 
events were 24.4% with TOBI Podhaler and 22.0% with TOBI nebuliser solution. 
A difference in FEV1 response by age was noted. In the patients aged <20 years the increase from 
baseline percent predicted FEV1 was larger: 11.3% for TOBI Podhaler and 6.9% for the nebuliser 
solution after 3 cycles. A numerically lower response in patients aged ≥20 years was observed: the 
change from baseline FEV1 observed in the patients aged ≥20 years was smaller (0.3% with TOBI 
Podhaler and 0.9% with TOBI nebuliser solution). 
Furthermore, an improvement of 6% in percent predicted FEV1 was obtained in about 30% versus 
36% of the adult patients in the TOBI Podhaler and TOBI nebuliser solution group respectively. 
Treatment with TOBI Podhaler for 28 days resulted in a statistically significant reduction in P. 
aeruginosa sputum density (-1.61 log10 CFUs), as did the nebuliser solution (-0.77 log10 CFUs). 
Suppression of sputum P. aeruginosa density was similar across age groups in both arms. In both 
studies, there was a trend for a recovery of P. aeruginosa density after the 28 days off-treatment 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period, which was reversed after a further 28 days on-treatment. 
In the active-controlled study, administration of a TOBI Podhaler dose was faster with a mean 
difference of approximately 14 minutes (6 minutes vs. 20 minutes with the nebuliser solution). Patient-
reported convenience and overall treatment satisfaction (as collected through a patient-reported 
outcomes questionnaire) were consistently higher with TOBI Podhaler compared with tobramycin 
nebuliser solution in each cycle. 
For safety results see section 4.8 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with TOBI 
Podhaler in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa 
pulmonary infection/colonisation in patients with cystic fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The systemic exposure to tobramycin after inhalation of TOBI Podhaler is expected to be primarily 
from the inhaled portion of the medicinal product as tobramycin is not absorbed to any appreciable 
extent when administered via the oral route. 
Serum concentrations 
After inhalation of a 112 mg single dose (4 x 28 mg capsules) of TOBI Podhaler in cystic fibrosis 
patients, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of tobramycin was 1.02 ± 0.53 μg/ml (mean ± SD) 
and the median time to reach the peak concentration (Tmax) was one hour. In comparison, after 
inhalation of a single dose of tobramycin 300 mg/5 ml nebuliser solution (TOBI), Cmax was 
1.04 ± 0.58 µg/ml and median Tmax was one hour. The extent of systemic exposure (AUC) was also 
similar for the 112 mg TOBI Podhaler dose and the 300 mg tobramycin nebuliser solution dose. At the 
end of a 4-week dosing cycle of TOBI Podhaler (112 mg twice daily), maximum serum concentration 
of tobramycin 1 hour after dosing was 1.99 ± 0.59 µg/ml. 
Sputum concentrations 
After inhalation of a 112 mg single dose (4 x 28 mg capsules) of TOBI Podhaler in cystic fibrosis 
patients, sputum Cmax of tobramycin was 1047 ± 1080 µg/g (mean ± SD). In comparison, after 
inhalation of a single 300 mg dose of tobramycin nebuliser solution (TOBI), sputum Cmax was 
737.3 ± 1028.4 µg/g. The variability in pharmacokinetic parameters was higher in sputum as 
compared to serum. 
Distribution 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis for TOBI Podhaler in cystic fibrosis patients estimated the 
apparent volume of distribution of tobramycin in the central compartment to be 84.1 litres for a typical 
CF patient. While the volume was shown to vary with body mass index (BMI) and lung function (as 
FEV1% predicted), model-based simulations showed that peak (Cmax) and trough (Ctrough) 
concentrations were not impacted markedly with changes in BMI or lung function. 
Biotransformation 
Tobramycin is not metabolised and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. 
Elimination 
Tobramycin is eliminated from the systemic circulation primarily by glomerular filtration of the 
unchanged compound. The apparent terminal half-life of tobramycin in serum after inhalation of a 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
112 mg single dose of TOBI Podhaler was approximately 3 hours in cystic fibrosis patients and 
consistent with the half-life of tobramycin after inhalation of tobramycin 300 mg/5 ml nebuliser 
solution (TOBI). 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis for TOBI Podhaler in cystic fibrosis patients aged 6 to 66 years 
estimated the apparent serum clearance of tobramycin to be 14 litres/h. This analysis did not show 
gender or age-related pharmacokinetic differences 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal that the main hazard for humans, based on studies of safety pharmacology, 
repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or toxicity to reproduction, consists of renal toxicity and 
ototoxicity. In general, toxicity is seen at higher systemic tobramycin levels than are achievable by 
inhalation at the recommended clinical dose. 
Carcinogenicity studies with inhaled tobramycin do not increase the incidence of any variety of 
tumour. Tobramycin showed no genotoxic potential in a battery of genotoxicity tests. 
No reproduction toxicology studies have been conducted with tobramycin administered by inhalation. 
However, subcutaneous administration of tobramycin during organogenesis was not teratogenic nor 
embryotoxic. Severely maternally toxic doses to female rabbits (i.e. nephrotoxicity) lead to 
spontaneous abortions and death. Based on available data from animals a risk of toxicity (e.g. 
ototoxicity) at prenatal exposure levels cannot be excluded. 
Subcutaneous administration of tobramycin did not affect mating behaviour or cause impairment of 
fertility in male or female rats.

Basic instructions for use are given below, more detailed instructions are available from the patient 
leaflet. 
1.  Wash and fully dry hands. 
2. 
Just before use, remove the Podhaler device from its case. Briefly inspect the inhaler to make 
sure it is not damaged or dirty. 
Holding the body of the inhaler, unscrew and remove the mouthpiece from the inhaler body. Set 
the mouthpiece aside on a clean, dry surface. 
Separate the morning and evening doses from the capsule card. 
Peel back the foil from the capsule card to reveal one TOBI Podhaler capsule and remove it 
from the card. 
Immediately insert the capsule into the inhaler chamber. Replace the mouthpiece and screw it 
on firmly until it stops. Do not overtighten. 
To puncture capsule, hold the inhaler with the mouthpiece down, press the button firmly with 
your thumb as far as it will go, then release the button. 
Fully exhale away from the inhaler. 
Place mouth over the mouthpiece creating a tight seal. Inhale the powder deeply with a single 
continuous inhalation.

8. 
9. 
10.  Remove inhaler from mouth, and hold breath for approximately 5 seconds, then exhale normally 
away from the inhaler. 
11.  After a few normal breaths away from the inhaler, perform a second inhalation from the same 
capsule. 
12.  Unscrew mouthpiece and remove the capsule from the chamber. 
Inspect the used capsule. It should appear punctured and empty. 
13. 
• 
• 
If the capsule is punctured but still contains some powder, place it back into the inhaler 
and take another two inhalations from the capsule. Reinspect capsule. 
If the capsule appears to be unpunctured, place it back into the inhaler, press the button 
firmly as far as it goes and take another two inhalations from the capsule. After this if the 
capsule is still full and appears to be unpunctured, replace the inhaler with the reserve 
inhaler and try again. 
14.  Discard the empty capsule. 
15.  Repeat, starting at step 5, for the remaining three capsules of the dose. 
16.  Replace the mouthpiece and screw it on firmly until it stops. When the full dose (4 capsules) has 
been inhaled, wipe mouthpiece with a clean dry cloth. 
17.  Place inhaler back in storage case and close tightly. The inhaler should never be washed with 
water.

Contents of the pack and other information 
Instructions for use with the Podhaler device (overleaf) 
1.  What TOBI Podhaler is and what it is used for 
What TOBI Podhaler is 
TOBI Podhaler contains a medicine called tobramycin which is an antibiotic. This antibiotic belongs 
to a class called aminoglycosides. 
What TOBI Podhaler is used for 
TOBI Podhaler is used in patients aged 6 years and older who have cystic fibrosis to treat lung 
infections caused by bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
For the best results from this medicine, please use it as this leaflet instructs you. 
How TOBI Podhaler works 
TOBI Podhaler is a powder for inhalation that is filled into capsules. When you inhale TOBI Podhaler, 
the antibiotic can enter directly into your lungs to fight against the bacteria causing the infection and to 
improve your breathing. 
What is Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
It is a very common bacterium that infects the lungs of nearly everyone with cystic fibrosis at some 
time during their lives. Some people do not get this infection until later on in their lives, while others 
get it very young. It is one of the most damaging bacteria for people with cystic fibrosis. If the 
infection is not properly fought, it will continue to damage your lungs, causing further problems to 
your breathing. 
2.  What you need to know before you take TOBI Podhaler 
Do not take TOBI Podhaler 
• 
if you are allergic to tobramycin, to any type of aminoglycoside antibiotic, or to any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If this applies to you, tell your doctor without taking TOBI Podhaler. 
If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any of the following conditions: 
• 
hearing problems (including noises in the ears and dizziness), or your mother has had hearing 
problems after taking an aminoglycoside 
certain gene variants (a change in the gene) related to hearing abnormalities inherited from your 
mother 
kidney problems 
unusual difficulty in breathing with wheezing or coughing, chest tightness 
blood in your sputum (the substance you cough up) 
muscle weakness  that lasts or becomes worse over time, a symptom mostly related to conditions 
such as myasthenia or Parkinson’s disease. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking TOBI Podhaler. 
If you are aged 65 years or older, your doctor may perform additional tests to decide if TOBI Podhaler 
is right for you. 
Inhaling medicines can cause chest tightness and wheezing and this can happen immediately after 
inhalation of TOBI Podhaler. Your doctor will supervise your first dose of TOBI Podhaler and check 
your lung function before and after dosing. Your doctor may ask you to use other appropriate

Strains of Pseudomonas can become resistant to treatment with an antibiotic over time. This means 
that TOBI Podhaler may not work as well as it should over time. Talk to your doctor if you are 
concerned about this.

hearing loss, dizziness and kidney damage.

button. 
• You are now ready to inhale the capsule in 2 separate 
breaths (Steps 8 and 9). 
Inhale the capsule – 1st breath: 
Before putting the mouthpiece in your mouth, breathe out 
fully, away from the inhaler. 
Place your mouth over the mouthpiece – to make a tight 
seal. 
Inhale the powder deeply with a single breath. 
Remove the inhaler from your mouth, and hold your 
breath for about 5 seconds. 
Then breathe out normally, away from the inhaler. 
9.

chamber (2). 
11.  Look at the used capsule. It should appear pierced and 
empty. If it is empty, discard the capsule.

Put the pierced side of the capsule in first. 
• Replace the mouthpiece and repeat steps 8,9 and 10. 
If the capsule does not look pierced: 
• Put the capsule back into the inhaler chamber (step 6) 
• Replace the mouthpiece and repeat Steps 7, 8 and 9. 
• After this if the capsule is still full and appears not to be 
pierced, replace the inhaler with the reserve inhaler and 
repeat Steps 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. 
12.  Take the other 3 capsules in the same way.

The chances of the capsule breaking into pieces will be increased if the capsule is accidentally 
pierced more than once or if the device is not held with the mouthpiece pointing down during 
step 7.

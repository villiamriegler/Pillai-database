2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, WHO was informed about a cluster of cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause 
in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this atypical pneumonia was identified as a 
novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were 
published. Since then, the virus has spread globally and on 30 January 2020 the World Health 
Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 11 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022

March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak. 
According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung 
injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis.  
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for Spikevax 25 μg are: 
• 
• 
Proposed indication: Spikevax is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 months to 5 years of age. 
Dosing administration: Spikevax is administered as a primary series course of 2 (two) 25 
microgram doses (0.1 mg/mL, 0.25 mL per dose), 1 month apart, to children 6 months to 5 years 
of age. 
For children 6 months to 5 years of age who have undergone solid organ transplantation or who are 
diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise, a third 
primary series dose at least 1 month following the second dose is recommended, aligned with similar 
recommendations in older age groups. 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
From the start of the pandemic to March 2022, over 7.7 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported 
among children 0 to 4 years of age and approximately 11.4 million cases of COVID-19 have been 
reported among children 5 to 9 years of age in 104 countries (UNICEF 2022). The true number of cases is 
almost certainly much larger, as testing is not widely available in many countries. According to the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET 2022b), a 
population-based surveillance system in the US that collects data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-
associated hospitalisations among children and adults through a network of over 250 acute-care hospitals 
in 14 states (COVID-NET 2022a), there were 3,606 hospitalised children between 0 to 4 years of age 
through 16 April 2022, with an estimated 24.1% of these children requiring ICU interventions, and with 
21 related in-hospital deaths reported observed (CDC 2022a). Additionally, approximately 6% of these 
children required mechanical ventilation (COVID-NET 2022b). 
Generally, national US data regarding children between 0 and 4 years are aligned with those identified 
from the COVID-NET surveillance system. Overall, in the US in the 0-to-4-year age group, there have 
been over 2.2 million cases of COVID-19 reported and over 465 deaths (COVID-19 Data Tracker 2022) 
reported to the CDC. An evaluation of COVID-19 incidence over time indicates marked increases in the 0-
to-4-year age group occurring with the Delta and Omicron variant waves. The cumulative incidence of 
COVID-19–associated hospitalisations was 49.7 per 100,000 children and adolescents from 01 Mar 2020 
through 14 Aug 2021 (Delahoy et al 2021). Prior to the Delta wave, in June 2021, there were 14.1 
incidence case of COVID-19 per 100,000 population among ages 0 to 4 years. Peak incidence among 0 to 
4 years was 187.0 incident cases per 100,000 population in Aug 2021 during the Delta wave, increasing 
to 894.6 cases per 100,000 population during the Omicron wave in Jan 2022 (COVID-19 Data Tracker 
2022b). 
Initial data suggest that the demographics of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 shifted to younger age 
groups after the onset of the Omicron wave (Goga et al 2021; United Kingdom Health Security Agency 
2021; Abdullah et al 2022). During the Omicron wave, hospitalisations among those aged 0 to 17 years 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 8/116 
 
 
 
 
rose to 46.2% when comparing the week of 01 to 07 January 2022 to the last week in December 2021. 
Children aged 0-4 had a dramatic three-fold increase from 4.9 to 15.6 per 100,000 children. The 7-day 
proportion of emergency room visits increased from 18.4% at the peak of the Delta wave to a current 7-
day proportion of 31.3% among those 17 years and younger in relation to older age groups (CDC 2022d). 
During the Omicron variant wave, peak hospitalisations were nearly four times (7.1 per 100,000 children 
and adolescents) that observed during the Delta variant wave (1.8 per 100,000 children and 
adolescents). Hospitalisation rates among children aged 0 to 4 years were approximately five times 
higher during the Omicron-predominant peak period (15.6) compared with the -Delta predominant period 
(2.9) (response rate [RR] = 5.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0, 7.2). Since March 2020, 
approximately 1 in 4 hospitalised children and adolescents with COVID-19 has required intensive care. 
While rates of severe disease have not increased since the start of the pandemic, the increase in absolute 
numbers of cases has added substantial burden overall, including the number of children requiring ICU 
admissions. In addition, children with underlying conditions and/or immune deficiency or 
immunocompromised status, as well as infants (i.e., <1 year of age), may be at higher risk for severe 
disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Shen et al 2020; Marks et al 2022b). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. It 
is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 
has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) 
proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and 
transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with 
the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin converting enzyme 
2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion with the 
cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development because it 
was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune response that 
prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. After infection 
individuals remain infectious for up to two weeks and can spread the virus even if they do not show 
symptoms.  
The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 9/116 
 
 
 
 
Although incidence of severe COVID-19, hospitalisation and mortality is lower in children than adults, 
clinical disease of all severities occurs in children, especially in those with comorbidities and risk factors. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
A distinctive manifestation of SARS-Co-V-2 in children and adolescents is development of a life-
threatening hyperinflammatory state 4 to 6 weeks after infection with primary COVID-19, called 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (Vogel et al 2021). MIS-C often presents with 
persistent fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation and cardiac damage, and, in severe cases, 
hypotension and shock (CDC 2021d). There is also evidence of chronic sequelae known as “long-COVID-
19” in children even after mild infection; this includes fatigue, muscle and joint pain, insomnia, 
respiratory problems, and palpitations that may be seen up to 6 months after infection (Dembiński et al 
2021). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Spikevax (also referred to in this report as COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna or mRNA-1273) is a vaccine 
approved for prevention of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is based on nucleoside-modified mRNA 
encoding for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein modified with 2 proline substitutions within the 
heptad repeat 1 domain (S-2P) to stabilise the spike protein into a prefusion conformation. The mRNA is 
encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). 
Upon delivery and uptake by body cells the mRNA is translated in the cytosol and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein is generated by the host cell machinery. The spike protein is presented and elicits an adaptive 
humoral and cellular immune response. Neutralising antibodies are directed against it and hence it is 
considered a relevant target antigen for vaccine development.  
Spikevax is currently indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 6 years of age and older.  
Spikevax is administered as a course of two 100 microgram doses to individuals 12 years of age and 
older and to children 6 through 11 years of age as a course of two 50 microgram doses, which is half of 
the primary dose for individuals 12 years and older. A third dose of Spikevax may be given at least 28 
days after the second dose to individuals 12 years of age and older (100 micrograms) and children 6 
through 11 years (50 micrograms) who are severely immunocompromised. 
A booster dose of Spikevax (50µg) given at least 3 months after completion of the primary series has 
currently been approved for adults 18 years of age and older.  
In addition, a 50 μg booster dose of Spikevax to adolescents (12 to < 18 years) at a dosing interval of at 
least 3 months after completion of the primary series with Spikevax (homologous boost) to prevent 
COVID-19 has been approved, mostly based on the extrapolation of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy 
data from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) to the adolescent target age group. 
Within the present submission the MAH requests the use of Spikevax 25 μg for active immunisation to 
prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 6 months to 5 years of age administered as a primary series of two 25 
microgram doses (0.1 mg/mL, 0.25 mL per dose), 1 month apart.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study  mRNA-1273-P204  (hereafter  Study  P204)  is  an  ongoing  Phase  2/3,  3-part,  open-label,  dose-
escalation,  age  de-escalation  and  subsequent  randomized,  observer-blind,  placebo-controlled  expansion 
study  to  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  reactogenicity,  and  effectiveness  of  mRNA-1273  in  healthy 
children 6 months to less than 12 years of age. The study population includes 3 age groups (≥6 years to 
<12 years, ≥2 years to <6 years, and ≥6 months to <2 years). 
Study mRNA-1273-P204 Design for Children 6 Months to < 6 Years 
Vaccine  effectiveness  is  inferred  based  on  demonstrating  noninferiority  of  the  neutralising  antibody 
responses  compared  with  those  obtained  from  young  adults  (≥18  to  <25  years  of  age)  enrolled  in  the 
ongoing adult study P301. Immunogenicity data from the comparator group of young adults in study P301 
are based on results from the Duke University Medical Center (Part 1) and PPD Vaccine Laboratories (Part 
2) performed on samples from study P301.

Methods 
Study participants 
Participants were enrolled at approximately 75 to 100 study sites in the United States and Canada. 
Inclusion criteria: 
Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all the following criteria apply: 
1.  The participant is male or female, 6 months to < 12 years of age at the time of consent/assent 
(Screening Visit), who is in good general health, in the opinion of the investigator, based on 
review of medical history and screening physical examination. 
2.  If the participant has a chronic disease (eg, asthma, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, human 
immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), the disease should be stable, per investigator 
assessment, so that the participant can be considered eligible for inclusion. Stable diseases are 
those which have had no change in their status or in the medications required to control them in 
the 6 months prior to Screening Visit.  
Note: a change in medication for dose optimisation (eg, insulin dose changes), change within class of 
medication, or reduction in dose are not considered signs of instability.  
3.  In the investigator’s opinion, the parent(s)/LAR(s) understand and are willing and physically able 
to comply with protocol-mandated follow-up, including all procedures, and provide written 
informed consent and participants are willing to provide assent.  
4.  The participant is 2 years or older and has a body mass index (BMI) at or above the third 
percentile according to WHO Child Growth Standards at the Screening Visit  
5.  Female participants of nonchildbearing potential may be enrolled in the study. Nonchildbearing 
potential is defined as premenarche. 
Special inclusion criteria for female participants who have reached menarche: 
6.  Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study if the participant fulfils 
all of the following criteria: 
-  Has a negative pregnancy test at Screening. Pregnancy test will be performed if deemed 
appropriate by the investigator. 
-  Has practiced adequate contraception or has abstained from all activities that could result in 
pregnancy for at least 28 days prior to the first injection (Day 1). 
-  Has agreed to continue adequate contraception or abstinence through 3 months following the 
second injection (Day 29) and the third dose in Part 3 (Day 149/BD-Day 1). 
- 
Is not currently breastfeeding. 
Adequate female contraception is defined as abstinence or consistent and correct use of a US FDA-
approved contraceptive method in accordance with the product label. 
Exclusion Criteria 
Participants will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:

1.  Has a known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 2 weeks prior to administration of IP or 
known close contact with anyone with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 
within 2 weeks prior to administration of IP. 
2.  Is acutely ill or febrile 24 hours prior to or at the Screening Visit. Fever is defined as a body 
temperature ≥38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F. Participants who meet this criterion may have visits 
rescheduled within the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can 
be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. 
3.  Has previously been administered an investigational or approved CoV (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, SARS-
CoV, MERS-CoV) vaccine. 
4.  Has undergone treatment with investigational or approved agents for prophylaxis against COVID-
19 (e.g., receipt of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies) within 6 months prior to enrolment. 
5.  Has a known hypersensitivity to a component of the vaccine or its excipients. Hypersensitivity 
includes, but is not limited to, anaphylaxis or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a 
previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene 
glycol [PEG] or immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate). 
6.  Has a medical or psychiatric condition that, according to the investigator's judgment, may pose 
additional risk as a result of participation, interfere with safety assessments, or interfere with 
interpretation of results. 
7.  Has a history of diagnosis or condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, may affect study 
endpoint assessment or compromise participant safety, specifically the following: 
- 
- 
- 
Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, excluding HIV infection, as described in Inclusion 
Criteria 2 
Chronic hepatitis or suspected active hepatitis 
A bleeding disorder that is considered a contraindication to IM injection or phlebotomy

older. 
8.  Has received the following: 
- 
Any routine vaccination with inactivated or live vaccine(s) within 14 days prior to first vaccination 
or plans to receive such a vaccine through 14 days following the last study vaccination. 
Note: This excludes influenza vaccine that may be given, however, not within 14 days prior to or post 
Dose 1 or Dose 2. If a participant receives an influenza vaccine, this should be captured within the 
concomitant medication electronic case report form (eCRF).

family members / household contacts of employees of the larger institution or affiliated private 
practice not part of the study site may be enrolled. 
Treatments 
In Part 1, doses of mRNA-1273 were evaluated in an open-label fashion, leading to the selection of one 
dose for evaluation in the larger, blinded, placebo-controlled Part 2. The older children 2 to < 6 years 
were enrolled to Part 1 first in order to evaluate dose levels of 25 μg and 50 μg mRNA-1273 administered 
as a two-dose schedule one month apart. Dose-escalation to 100-μg dose was not performed. The 
youngest children of 6 months to < 2 years received 25 μg of mRNA-1273 in Part 1 while no children 
were enrolled in the 50-μg mRNA-1273 study arm in this age group. For each of the two paediatric age 
groups, the selection of 25 μg was agreed for Part 2. In Part 2, participants received either 25 µg of 
Spikevax or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) by intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle or 
anterolateral thigh 28 days apart (i.e., Day 1 and Day 29). The protocol specified a window of +7 days for 
administration of the second dose.

1 The case definition of COVID-19 includes at least one of the following systemic symptoms: fever (temperature 
> 38ºC/≥ 100.4ºF) or chills (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours), cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 
hours), shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours), fatigue, headache, 
myalgia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea 
or vomiting, poor appetite or poor feeding, AND a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 
Immunogenicity assessment 
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments were analysed for: 
- 
- 
Serum nAb titer against SARS-CoV-2 as measured by pseudotyped virus neutralising assay 
(PsVNA). 
Serologic markers for SARS-CoV-2 infection using the non-vaccine antigen-based Nucleocapsid 
Elecsys assay at Day 1 (prior to the first dose), Day 57, Day 209, and Day 394. Swabs were also 
collected on Day 43 from a subset of children (Cohort E). 
The assays used for the immunogenicity analyses are based on both the D614G form (neutralisation) and 
the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (binding).  
The primary efficacy/immunogenicity objectives and endpoints are endorsed. 
All serological assays are considered acceptably validated for use in the assessment of clinical samples. Of 
note, testing of nAb levels (PsVNA against the prototype (D614G) virus strain) was transferred from Duke 
University Medical Center (Part 1) to PPD Vaccine Laboratories for Part 2 (after concordance between the 
two PsVNAs was established), according to MAH due in part to capacity restrictions at the Duke 
Laboratory. The Study P301 comparator subset was retested at PPD Vaccine Laboratories to enable 
comparisons for analysis of Part 2. Technicians performing all PsVNAs were blinded to the associated 
study visits of samples at both Duke University Medical Center and PPD Vaccine Laboratories. Although 
the change of the test centre was not optimal, comparability is thus considered to be given. The MAH was 
asked to clarify whether the analysis of P204 samples and P301 samples were conducted 
contemporaneously at PPD or not. The MAH has confirmed that P204 and P301 samples were tested 
contemporaneously at PPD. 
Several exploratory objectives and corresponding endpoints were defined in the protocol, and it is noted 
that information on VoCs causing breakthrough infections, T-cell responses and Omicron neutralisation 
data will only become available by Q2 2023 and will be included in the P204 interim CSR. As these data 
are considered as supportive, no impact on the overall conclusion is foreseen. 
COVID-19 case definition and surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for COVID-19 and on 
RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 from samples collected within 72 hours of the study participant 
reporting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID-19. The participant must have at least 1 nasal swab 
(or respiratory sample, if hospitalised) positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. 
Throughout the study the following pre-specified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID-
19 will be elicited weekly from the participant, and the presence of any one of these symptoms (in the 
absence of an alternative diagnosis) lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory 
symptoms) will result in the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect a nasal swab for SARS-
CoV-2 within 72 hours. Case definition defined in study P204 are summarised below.

Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 overlap with solicited systemic ARs that are expected after 
vaccination with mRNA-1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and chills). During the first 7 days after 
vaccination, investigators should decide if a nasal swab should be collected. The collection of a nasal swab 
prior to the first dose on Day 1, prior to the second dose on Day 29, and then at all subsequent study 
visits (Day 43 [if visit is applicable], Day 57, Day 209, and Day 394) can help ensure that cases of 
COVID-19 are not overlooked. Any study participant who reports respiratory symptoms during the 7-day 
period after vaccination without an alternative diagnosis should be evaluated for COVID-19. 
Surveillance for COVID-19 symptoms is conducted via biweekly telephone calls or eDiary prompts as 
specified in the protocol (Figure 1) starting after participant enrolment and continuing throughout the 
study. If there is no response to an eDiary prompt for 2 days, the study site staff will contact the study 
participant by telephone. 
Throughout the study the following pre-specified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID-
19 will be elicited weekly from the participant, and the presence of any one of these symptoms (in the 
Assessment report

absence of an alternative diagnosis) lasting at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory 
symptoms) will result in the study site staff arranging an illness visit to collect a nasal swab for SARS-
CoV-2 within 72 hours. 
Study objectives and endpoints correspond well and both are endorsed. The endpoint based on COVID-19 
‘P301 case definition’ was not specified in protocol P304 (amendment 5). 
For the secondary endpoint of antibody persistence over time and exploratory objectives no outcome data 
are provided as part of this submission. 
Sample size 
Sample size considerations for booster doses and a three dose regimen in children above 6 years of age 
are not covered in this section as they are not relevant to this procedure. 
The initial age groups in Part 1 were for estimation purposes. With approximately 750 participants 
(approximately 375 participants at each dose level of mRNA-1273) in the initial 6 to < 12 years age 
group, there was at least a 90% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true AE rate 
of 1% for a given dose level. In each of the younger age groups (2 to < 6 years and 6 months to < 2 
years), the safety assessment was to occur during the conduct of Part 2 after approximately 375 
participants have been exposed to mRNA-1273 at the dose level selected for Part 2 by the DSMB.  
The sample size in the expansion (Part 2) was to support the safety database in the paediatric 
participants 6 months to < 12 years of age. With up to 3,000 participants each in the 6 to < 12 years, 2 
to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years of age groups exposed to mRNA-1273 at a given dose level in 
Part 2, the study had at least a 95% probability to observe at least 1 participant with an AE at a true 
0.1% AE rate for a given dose level. 
Sample size for immunogenicity subset 
A subset of Full Analysis Set (FAS) participants (Immunogenicity Subset) in each age group was to be 
selected for measuring immunogenicity data. The immunogenicity samples of the Immunogenicity Subset 
was to be processed, and the analysis of primary immunogenicity endpoint was to be based on the 
Immunogenicity PP Subset. Assuming approximately 25% of participants in the Immunogenicity Subset 
were not to meet the criteria to be included in the Immunogenicity PP Subset, approximately 528 
participants in Part 2 (~396 receiving mRNA-1273 and ~132 receiving placebo) were to be selected for 
the Immunogenicity Subset from which approximately 289 participants on mRNA-1273 were to be 
suitable for the Immunogenicity PP Subset. 
If a threshold of protection was available for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, with approximately 
289 participants on mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of an age group, there was to be at 
least 90% power to rule out 70% with a 2-sided 95% CI (lower bound of the 95% CI > 70%) for the 
percentage of mRNA-1273 participants exceeding the accepted threshold if the true rate of participants 
exceeding the threshold is 80%. 
If an acceptable antibody threshold of protection against COVID-19 was not available at the time of 
analysis for the primary immunogenicity endpoint, non-inferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on 
the 2 co-primary endpoints were to be performed, respectively. The sample size calculation for each of 
the 2 non-inferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was chosen for the study. 
With approximately 289 participants receiving mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of each age 
group in Study P204 and 289 young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301, there was to be 
90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response, as measured by the antibody GM 
value, in the paediatric population at a 2
sided alpha of 0.05, compared with that in young adults (18 to

1273, assuming an underlying GMR value of 1, a non-
inferiority margin of 0.67 (or 1.5), and a point estimate minimum threshold of 0.8. The standard 
‑
deviation of the natural log
transformed levels was assumed to be 1.5.  
With approximately 289 participants receiving mRNA-1273 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset of each age 
‑
group in Study P204 and 289 young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301, there was to be at 
least 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response as measured by sero-response 
rate in children at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, compared with that in young adults 18 to 25 years of age in 
Study P301 receiving mRNA-1273, assuming sero-response rate of 85% in young adults of 18 to 25 years 
of age from Study P301, true sero-response rate of 85% in children (or true rate difference is 0 compared 
to young adults from Study P301), a non-inferiority margin of 10% and a point estimate minimum 
threshold of -5% in sero-response rate difference.  
In the 1273-P203 interim analysis (data snapshot on 08 May 2021), the observed sero-response rates at 
Day 57 were high in both 18 to 25 years of age group from Study P301 (98.6% with 95% CI: 96.6, 99.6) 
and 12 to 17 years of age group (98.8% with 95% CI: 97.0, 99.7), based on pseudovirus nAb ID50 
titers. For this Study P204, if the true sero-response rates were assumed to be 95% or higher in both 18 
to 25 years of age group from Study P301 and an age group in children, with between-group true 
difference within 4%, there will be a >90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority by sero-response rate in 
children compared with 18 to 25 years of age in Study P301, at a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.  
Randomisation 
Random assignment of participants in Part 2 of the study was to be based on a centralised interactive 
response technology, in accordance with pre-generated randomisation schedules. Up to 4,000 
participants each in the 6 to < 12 years, 2 to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years age groups were to 
be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to the mRNA-1273 arm (n = up to 3,000 participants in each group) or 
placebo arm (n = up to 1,000 participants in each group). 
The 3:1 randomisation of subjects in Part 2 is considered acceptable. For children 6-12 years of age the 
MAH stated upon request that all available immunogenicity data from Part 1 (excluding the dose-finding 
cohort based on the first 75 subjects per dose) was used for immunogenicity analyses. It is assumed that 
also for these age cohorts all available samples were used. The sampling itself was however not randomly 
done. Overall, the immunogenicity subset is not considered as fully “pre-specified”. 
Part 1 and Part 2 populations were independent.  
Immunogenicity comparisons (primary efficacy) are essentially addressed by a single-arm trial (with 
comparator arm 18-24 yoa from study P301) randomisation is of secondary relevance in this regard. 
However, in terms of secondary/ exploratory efficacy and safety outcomes (comparison with placebo), 
randomisation of individuals according to pre-generated randomisation schedules to the treatment groups 
is considered adequate.  
Blinding (masking) 
Part 1 of this study was planned as open label; blinding procedures were not applicable.  
Part 2 of this study was to be conducted in an observer-blind manner. The investigator, study staff, study 
participants, study site monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) were to be blinded to the IP 
administered until study end, with certain exceptions as defined in the protocol.

Statistical methods 
The following display of statistical methods does not cover methods for Part 3 (3-dose regimen with 25μg 
per dose for 6 to 12 year old children) introduced with Protocol Amendment 6 and the additional option 
for booster doses which was introduced with Amendment 7. 
Analyses sets 
The following analysis sets were defined: 
Immunogenicity analyses 
The primary analysis population for immunogenicity was to be the Immunogenicity PP Subset, unless 
specified otherwise. The primary objective of this study was to use the immunogenicity response to infer 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 24/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efficacy in participants aged 6 months to < 12 years at the dose level selected for expansion. For this 
objective, analyses of immunogenicity were to be performed for each paediatric age group separately at 
the selected dose level based on the participants in the Immunogenicity PP Subset. It was planned that 
for each paediatric age group, participants in Part 2 in the Immunogenicity PP Subset may be used for 
immunogenicity primary analysis.  
Methods for analyses were defined dependent on the availability of a threshold of protection against 
COVID-19. As this was not the case the following display is restricted to the other case. 
If no accepted serum antibody threshold of protection against COVID-19 was established, immune 
response as measured by GM value and seroresponse rate in each age group based on Day 57 antibody 
levels was to be compared to that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using data from Study P301. 
An analysis of covariance model was to be carried out with antibody at Day 57 as dependent variable and 
a group variable (a paediatric age group in Study P204 versus young adults [18 to 25 years of age] in 
Study P301) as the fixed variable for each paediatric age group. The GM values of the paediatric age 
group at Day 57 were to be estimated by the geometric least square mean (GLSM) from the model. The 
GMR (ratio of GM values) was to be estimated by the ratio of GLSM from the model. The corresponding 2-
sided 95% CI was to be provided to assess the difference in immune response between the paediatric age 
group (Study P204) compared to the young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301 at Day 57. For 
each paediatric age group, the non-inferiority of GM value was to be considered demonstrated if: 
• 
• 
The lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMR is ≥ 0.67 based on the non-inferiority margin of 1.5, 
AND 
The GMR point estimate ≥ 0.8 (minimum threshold). 
The number and percentage of participants with sero-response due to vaccination was to be provided 
with 2-sided 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method at each post-baseline time point with Day 57 
being of the primary interest. The sero-response rate difference with 95% CI at Day 57 was to be 
provided between children receiving mRNA-1273 in Study P204 and young adults of 18 to 25 years of age 
receiving mRNA-1273 from Study P301. For each paediatric age group, the non-inferiority of sero-
response rate was to be considered demonstrated if: 
• 
• 
The lower bound of the 95% CI of the sero-response rate difference is ≥ -10% based on the non-
inferiority margin of 10%, AND 
The sero-response rate difference point estimate ≥ -5% (minimum threshold). 
In addition, the GM value of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody with corresponding 95% CI was to be 
provided at each time point. The 95% CIs were to be calculated based on the t-distribution of the log-
transformed values then back transformed to the original scale. For each age group, the geometric mean 
fold
rise of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% CI at each post-baseline time point over pre-
injection baseline at Day 1 was to be provided. Descriptive summary statistics including median, 
‑
minimum, and maximum was also to be provided.  
Multiplicity Adjustment Between Age Groups 
A hierarchical hypothesis testing (fixed-sequence method) was to be used to adjust multiplicity to 
preserve the family-wise Type I error rate (alpha = 0.05), starting with the oldest age group, followed by 
the middle age group, and then followed by the youngest age group. The primary series immunogenicity 
co-primary endpoint hypotheses for the oldest age group (6 years to < 12 years of age) was to be tested 
first at alpha level of 0.05 in Part 1 expansion. If the testing in the oldest age group is statistically 
significant (meeting the non-inferiority success criteria of the co-primary endpoints), the alpha level of 
0.05 will be passed to the testing of the primary series co-primary endpoint hypotheses in the middle age 
group (2 years to < 6 years of age) in Part 2. If the testing in the middle age group is statistically 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 25/116 
 
 
 
 
significant at alpha level of 0.05, then the alpha 0.05 is preserved for testing the primary series co-
primary endpoint hypotheses in the youngest age group (6 months to < 2 years of age) in Part 2. 
Interim analyses 
Part 1: Interim analyses might have been performed after all or a subset of participants (with 
immunogenicity samples collected for D1 and D57) have completed Day 57 within an age group in Part 1 
(one optional interim analysis for each age group, 3 interim analyses total for the 3 age groups in Part 1). 
Analyses of safety and immunogenicity might have been conducted at each interim analysis. 
Part 2: An interim analysis of immunogenicity and safety was to be performed after all or a subset of 
participants have completed Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) in Part 1 or Part 2 within an age 
group. This interim analysis was to be considered the primary analysis of immunogenicity for a given age 
group. Another interim analysis on safety might have been performed after a different subset or all 
participants have completed Day 57 in an age group. 
Efficacy analyses 
To evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 after vaccination with mRNA-1273 or placebo, the incidence rate 
was to be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group, calculated as the number of cases 
divided by the total person-time. Participants in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study and in different age groups 
who receive the same mRNA-1273 dose level (if applicable) may be combined in the analysis. 
For serologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19, regardless of symptomatology or severity, 
infection rate was to be provided by vaccination group, dose level, and age group. The same analysis 
were to be conducted for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
The secondary efficacy analyses were to be performed on the PP Set, with sensitivity analyses in FAS, 
mITT Set, and mITT1 Set. Analyses of the efficacy endpoints in Part 2 were to be performed for the 
randomised blinded phase. Additional exploratory analyses were to be conducted in the blinded and 
unblinded phases for participants randomised to mRNA-1273 in Part 2, and in the unblinded phase for 
participants who are originally randomised to the placebo arm and cross-over to mRNA-1273 after use of 
any COVID-19 vaccine is authorised or licensed for the participant’s age group.

Study mRNA-1273-P204 Design for Children 6 Months to <6 years 
The MAH submitted data showing the evaluation of children 6 months to < 2 years and 2 to < 6 years of 
age (snapshot data on 21 Feb 2022). 
For each of the 2 younger age groups, children were enrolled first to Part 1 for dose selection and 
subsequently to Part 2. Part 1 evaluated dosages of mRNA-1273 in an open-label fashion and led to the 
selection of a dosage for evaluation in the larger, blinded, placebo-controlled Part 2. As the study followed 
a pattern of age de-escalation, the older children (2 to < 6 years) were enrolled to Part 1 (to evaluate 
dose levels of 25 μg and 50 μg administered as a two-dose schedule one month apart) prior to younger 
children (6 months to < 2 years). 
Assessment of the 50-μg dose (n=150 enrolled) in the 2 to < 6-year group indicated a rate of fever 
similar to that after the 100-μg dose in the older age group (6 to < 12 years). Accordingly, a lower dose 
Assessment report

(25 μg) was evaluated in a group of 2 to < 6-year-old children in Part 1, a dose that proved less 
reactogenic than 2 injections of 50 μg of mRNA-1273.  
The youngest children (6 months to < 2 years) received 25 μg of mRNA-1273 in Part 1. No children were 
enrolled in the 50-μg mRNA-1273 study arm in children 6 months to < 2 years of age. 
For the submission for extension of the indication to children (6 months to <6 years), mRNA-1273 
effectiveness is inferred based on meeting pre-specified non-inferiority criteria for immunobridging to 
young adults (18 to 25 years) in the pivotal P301 study, which established the clinical efficacy of mRNA-
1273. 
Vaccine Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity data from Study P204 are described, first for children 2 to <6 years and then for infants 
6 months to <2 years. Where applicable, data are presented first for Part 1 and then for Part 2 for each 
age group. 
The immunogenicity analysis from Part 2 serves as the basis for the demonstration of vaccine 
effectiveness in support of EUA. Results of neutralising antibody (nAb; measured by PsVNA) are provided 
by the MAH. 
The protocol stated that the primary immunogenicity objective of Study P204 is to infer the effectiveness 
of mRNA-1273 based on the primary endpoint as follows: 
• 
• 
If an acceptable threshold of protection has been established, the proportion of participants with a 
serum Ab level at Day 57 that is greater than or equal to Ab threshold of protection 
If an acceptable threshold of protection has not been established, the geometric mean (GM) value 
of serum Ab level and seroresponse rate from Study P204 vaccine recipients at Day 57 compared 
with those from young adult (18 to 25 years of age) vaccine recipients (Day 57) in the clinical 
endpoint efficacy trial (Study P301) 
Day 57 (1 month after the second dose) was chosen for the timepoint of immunogenicity analysis 
because Abs tend to peak approximately 28 days after vaccination. This timepoint was used for 
immunogenicity in the pivotal adult study (Study P301) in which the VE has been established. This 
timepoint was also used for immunobridging in the adolescent and older paediatric populations (Study 
P203). 
At the time of analysis for this submission, a serum antibody threshold of vaccine protection against 
COVID-19 had not been established. Therefore, the primary objective to infer the effectiveness of mRNA-
1273 was evaluated by comparing the GM value of serum antibody level and seroresponse rates from 
Study P204 vaccine recipients at Day 57 to those obtained from young adult (18 to 25 years of age) 
vaccine recipients (Day 57) in the pivotal study (Study P301), which established the efficacy of mRNA-
1273. 
Part 1 PP Immunogenicity Subset (2 to < 6 Years) 
The immunogenicity results from the Part 1 PP Immunogenicity Subset for the 25-μg (n=50) and the 50-
μg (n=69) groups in children 2 to < 6 years of age are presented. 
Day 57 (28 days post-dose 2) nAb results for children 2 to < 6 years were compared with previously 
generated results from the PP Immunogenicity Subset of 18- to 25-year-old participants in Study P301.

Part 1 recipients of 25 μg (n=50) had a nAb GMT of 1013.766 (Table 16) with 100% achieving 
seroresponse. Comparison of this GMT to that of young adults in Study P301 (18 to 25 years; n = 295) 
yielded a GMR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.61, 1.00) and a difference in seroresponse rates (SRR) of 1.0% (95% 
CI: -6.1%, 3.0%). 
Part 1 recipients of 50 μg (n=69) had a nAb GMT of 1844.127 (Table 16) with 100% achieving 
seroresponse. Comparison of this GMT to that of the P301 young adults yielded a GMR of 1.42 (95% CI 
1.14, 1.77) and a difference in SRR of 1.0% (95% CI: -4.3%, 3.0%).

Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset (2 to < 6 Years) 
The Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset was the pre-specified cohort for the assessment of the primary 
immunogenicity objective.  
Table 13 summarises the analysis of Day 57 serum nAb levels (measured by PsVNA ID50 assay) for 
children 2 to < 6 years of age in the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset, which are also depicted in Figure 
1 and the comparison with those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301.  
In the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset (n = 264; 25 μg) baseline nAb GMC was below the LLOQ; Day 57 
GMC was 1410.0 (95% CI: 1272.02, 1562.98) and 98.9% achieved sero-response. Sero-response at a 
participant level is defined as a change from below the LLOQ to equal or above 4 × LLOQ, or at least a 4-
fold rise if baseline is equal to or above the LLOQ. Percentages are based on the number of participants 
with non-missing data at baseline and the corresponding timepoint. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) 
from baseline to Day 57 was 183.3 (95% CI: 164.03, 204.91). 
The pre-specified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met thus enabling the 
inference of vaccine effectiveness from Study P301.  
The GMR of Day 57 nAb concentration from children 2 to < 6 years of age in Part 2 PP Immunogenicity 
Subset compared to Study P301 young adults 18 to 25 years was 1.014 (95% CI: 0.881, 1.167), meeting 
the non-inferiority success criterion (ie, lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR ≥ 0.67); the GMR point 
estimate criterion (≥ 0.8) was also met. The difference in sero-response rates (SRR) between the 2 
immunobridging groups was -0.4% (95% CI: -2.7%, 1.5%), also meeting the non-inferiority success 
criterion (lower bound of the 95% CI of the SRR difference > -10%). Therefore, the pre-specified success 
criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met.

Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset was the pre-specified cohort for the assessment of the primary

children 6 months to < 2 years of age in the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset and the comparison with 
those from young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study P301.  
Figure 2 depicts these results. 
In the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset (n = 230), baseline nAb GMC was below the LLOQ; Day 57 GMC 
was 1780.7 (95% CI: 1616.18, 1961.88; n = 230). On Day 57, 100% of children met criteria for 
seroresponse (Table 15). The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 was 225.3 (95% 
CI: 200.40, 253.27). 
The pre-specified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met (Table 15) thus 
enabling the inference of vaccine effectiveness from Study P301. The GMR of Day 57 nAb concentration 
from children 6 months to < 2 years of age in the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity Subset compared to Study 
P301 young adults 18 to 25 years was 1.280 (95% CI: 1.115, 1.470), meeting the non-inferiority success

Efficacy Analyses for Endpoints Starting 14 Days After Dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy (Part 2) 
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 in the PP 
Set for Efficacy were secondary endpoints.  
Table 17 summarises the descriptive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring at 
least 14 days after dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy. The analyses of efficacy were conducted in 
participants negative at baseline for both nasal swab RT-PCR and serology (Elecsys). 
Based on the PP Set for Efficacy, there were 119 cases (4.6%) in the mRNA-1273 group meeting the CDC 
case definition (incidence rate 175 per 1000 person-years) and 61 cases (7.1%) in the placebo group 
(incidence rate 277 per 1000 person-years), and VE was 36.8% (95% CI: 12.5%, 54.0%). For cases 
meeting the P301 case definition, there were 71 cases (2.7%) in the mRNA-1273 group (incidence rate 
104 per 1000 person-years) and 43 cases (5.0%) in the placebo group (incidence rate 194 per 1000 
person-years). VE was 46.4% (95% CI: 19.8%, 63.8%).

•  Sensitivity Analysis of All Reported Cases Regardless of Test Performed for Endpoints Starting 14 
Days After Dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy (Part 2) 
As noted above, a sensitivity analysis of efficacy included all reported cases (COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 
infection) regardless of test was performed. Table 17 summarises the sensitivity analysis performed on 
endpoints occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy. This analysis included 
endpoints derived based on RT-PCR (central and local laboratory-based), home testing, and cases lacking 
test modality identification. When evaluating all potential cases identified with any type of SARS-CoV-2 
diagnostic test, VE 14 days after dose 2 was 28.5% using the CDC and 37.5% using the P301 definition.

Efficacy Analyses for Endpoints Starting 14 Days After Dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy (Part 2) 
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 in the PP 
Set for Efficacy were secondary endpoints.  
Table 19 summarises the descriptive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 cases occurring at 
least 14 days after dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy. All summaries of efficacy are performed in baseline 
nasal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Elecsys negative participants. 
For cases meeting the CDC case definition, there were 51 cases (3.4%) in the mRNA- 1273 group 
(incidence rate 138 per 1000 person-years) and 34 cases (6.6%) in the placebo group (incidence rate 
280 per 1000 person-years), and VE was 50.6% (95% CI: 21.4%, 68.6%). According to P301 case 
definition, there were 37 cases (2.4%) in the mRNA-1273 group (incidence rate 100 per 1000 person-
years) and 18 cases (3.5%) in the placebo group (incidence rate 146 per 1000 person-years), and VE 
was 31.5% (95% CI: -27.7 %, 62.0%). Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection as defined occurred in 32 
cases (2.1%) in the mRNA-1273 group and 11 cases (2.1%) in the placebo group. VE was 3.8% (95% 
CI: -112%, 52.8%).

•  Sensitivity Analysis of All Reported Cases Regardless of Test Performed for Endpoints Starting 14 
Days After Dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy (Part 2) 
To account for the increased COVID-19 case numbers during the Omicron variant wave, results of home 
testing were also collected, starting in December 2021. According to protocol, families were encouraged 
in case of any positive home test to obtain a confirmatory RT PCR test, either at a local diagnostic lab or 
via an illness visit at the study site. Therefore, data for COVID-19 cases derived based on RT-PCR testing 
(performed at CLIA-certified central or local laboratory), based on home testing, or where the test 
modality was not identified were available.  
A sensitivity analysis of efficacy included all reported cases (COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection) 
regardless of test performed. Table 19 summarises the sensitivity analysis performed on endpoints 
occurring 14 days or more after dose 2 in the PP Set for Efficacy. When evaluating all potential cases 
identified with any type of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test, VE 14 days after dose 2 indicated to be 53.5% 
using the CDC and 43.7% using the P301 definition.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study was amended 7 times.  
The sample size of both, Part 1 and Part 2 were increased during the study to allow a better safety 
assessment. Planned sample sizes for safety as well as immunogenicity are overall endorsed but the 
study seems overpowered for most of the endpoints. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Immunobridging to infer effectiveness of vaccination from immune biological data of one population to 
the other is an accepted strategy for vaccines and has been used previously. Because there is currently 
no serologic correlate for protection, non-inferiority analyses based on post-vaccination antibody levels 
and response rates are usually recommended. As demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies, 
neutralising antibodies to the spike protein play a critical role in the prevention of COVID-19. In this 
study, antibody responses in children and young adults after vaccination with Spikevax were studied 
using assays to measure anti-spike binding and neutralising antibodies. Therefore, the results of the 
neutralising antibody response analyses are critical for demonstrating non-inferiority and assessing the 
acceptability of immunobridging.  
The MAH presented immunogenicity results from study P204 on children in the age groups 2 to <6 years 
and 6 months to 2 years separately. Study P204 was set up in a Part 1 and a Part 2 for each age group in 
Assessment report

order to define in Part 1 the most appropriate dose to move forward in Part 2. Study participants from 
Part 1 and Part 2 are not identical.  
The nAb GMT in the dose group of 25µg mRNA-1273 for children 2 to <6 years in Part 1 was 1013.766 
which was expectedly lower than the nAb GMT in the dose group of 50µg mRNA-1273 (1844.127). The 
nAb GMT in the comparator group from study P301 (100µg dose of mRNA-1273) was given as 1299.855. 
This part 1 was meant for dose finding and the number of participants in the age group 2 to < 6 years 
was limited (n=50). Part 1 in the age group 2 to <6 years led to the decision to move forward with 2 
injections of each 25µg mRNA-1273 for both age groups. 
In Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subset for children 2 to <6 years, 264 immunogenicity samples were 
analysed in the 25µg mRNA-1273 group and the nAb GMC compared to 295 immunogenicity samples 
from 18 to ≥25 year old adults from study P301. The resulting nAb GMCs were 1410.0 (2 to <6 years of 
age) and 1390.8 (18 to ≥25 years of age). 
The GMR of Day 57 nAb concentration from children 2 to <6 years of age compared to young adults 18 to 
≥25 years of age was 1.014 meeting the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. 
The difference in sero-response rates between these two groups was -0.4. Therefore, the pre-specified 
success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met.  
In Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subset for children 2 to <6 years of age 98.9% achieved sero-response as 
compared to 99.3% sero-response in young adults (18 to ≥25 years). The geometric mean fold rise 
(GMFR) from baseline to Day 57 was 183.3.  
In the PP Immunogenicity subset Part 1 for children 6 months to < 2 years, 97 samples were analysed in 
the PP Immunogenicity subset and nAb GMTs compared to 295 samples from young adults (18 to ≥25 
years).  
Children receiving 25 μg mRNA-1273 demonstrated a nAb GMT of 1782.603, and 100% met the definition 
of sero-response. Comparison of nAb GMT from Study P204 children (6 months to < 2 years) receiving 25 
μg mRNA-1273 to Study P301 young adults (18 to 25 years) yielded a GMR of 1.371. The difference in 
sero-response rates at Day 57 between the 2 groups was 1.0%. This supports the chosen dose for young 
children. As for children in the age group 2 years to <6 years, Part 1 was not intended for statistical 
analysis of the primary immunogenicity objective. 
In the PP Immunogenicity subset Part 2 for children 6 months to < 2 years, 230 samples were analysed 
and nAb GMCs compared to 295 samples from young adults (18 to ≥25 years). 
In the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subset, baseline nAb GMC was below the LLOQ; Day 57 nAb GMC was 
1780.7.  
The GMR of Day 57 nAb concentration from children 6 months to < 2 years of age in the Part 2 PP 
Immunogenicity subset compared to Study P301 young adults 18 to ≥25 years was 1.280. The GMR point 
estimate criterion (≥ 0.8) was met.  
On Day 57, 100% of children met criteria for sero-response. The difference in sero-response rates 
between the 2 immunobridging groups was 0.7%. The GMFR from baseline to Day 57 was 225.3. 
Therefore, the pre-specified success criteria for the primary immunogenicity objective were met. 
For children below the age of 2 results were consistent between Part 1 and 2. For children above 2 years 
of age results for GMT, GMT ratio and sero-response were not consistent across parts. In Part 1 the GMT 
was lower in P204 than in P301, while in Part 2 P204 showed higher GMTs than P301. For sero-response 
rates it was the other way around (although based on very small differences in counts). Nevertheless, 
both age cohorts met the pre-specified non-inferiority-criteria based on data from the respective Parts 2. 
The difference in the nAb GMC value for immunogenicity samples from study P301 in Part 2 as compared 
to Part 1 (nAb GMT 1299.855) was explained by the MAH as to: Samples from Part 1 for 2 to <6-year-old 
children were analysed in the Duke University Medical Center. Testing was transferred to PPD Vaccine 
Laboratories for Part 2. The study P301 comparator subset was also retested at PPD Vaccine Laboratories 
to enable comparison for analysis of Part 2. Therefore, values for samples between Part 1 and Part 2 for 2 
to <6-year-old children are not directly comparable but values within Part 1 or Part 2 are directly 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022

comparable as analysis has been performed in the same laboratory. The MAH was asked to clarify 
whether samples from study P204 were analysed contemporaneously with samples from study P301, in 
particular at PPD for both Part 2 Immunogenicity subsets. The MAH confirmed contemporaneous testing 
at PPD. 
In Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subset for children 2 to <6 years there were 24,2% two (2) years old 
children, 35,6% three (3) years old children, 29.2% four (4) years old children and 11.0% five (5) years 
old children participating. 
In the Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subset for children 6 months to <2 years, 18.3% of children were ≥6 
months and <1 year old. Accordingly, 81.7% of the children were ≥1 year to <2 years old. This age 
distribution is considered acceptable for an immunogenicity assessment of mRNA-1273 in children 6 
month to <6 years. 
The analysis presented for immunobridging was primarily based on Part 2 data, with data from Part 1 
provided in support. It was noted that the MAH deviated from the original sample size for immunogenicity 
analyses without further explanation. It was planned to collect immunogenicity samples of approximately 
396 subjects per age cohort in Part 2 who received mRNA-1273 leading to approximately 289 subjects in 
the immunogenicity PP set. For both age cohorts the numbers were substantially smaller with N=302 
(N=264) in the immunogenicity (PP) set for children 2 to 6 years of age, and N= 274 (N=230) subjects in 
the respective analysis sets for children 6 months to 2 years of age. The timing of the primary 
immunogenicity analyses was not unambiguously defined and the chosen data cut-off might be arbitrary. 
Given the results and the minor deviation in the sample size, the impact on the final results is considered 
minor.  
There was a notable overrepresentation of White participants in both Part 2 PP Immunogenicity subsets 
with 75.2% (6 months to < 2 years) and 71.2% (2 years to < 6 years) of participants in the respective 
age cohort. A bias on the results does not seem likely, however, cannot be excluded. For the European 
population the data is considered acceptable. 
Vaccine efficacy (VE) was assessed as a secondary endpoint in part 2 of the study in children who had 
been tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (by RT-PCR and serology) and who had received two 
doses of 25 µg Spikevax 28 days apart. VE was determined according to either of two case definitions: 
The CDC case definition reflecting less symptomatic disease and the P301 case definition reflecting more 
symptomatic disease. VE in the per-protocol set ranged from 32% (children <2 yoa, P301 definition) to 
51% (children <2yoa, CDC definition) with children ≥2 and <6 yoa in between (47% P301 definition, 
37% CDC definition). The MAH justifies these rather low efficacy results with the prevalence of the 
Omicron variant during the time of data collection. Indeed, as compared to research literature, point 
estimates of vaccine efficacy are consistent with the observed vaccine effectiveness after two doses of 
mRNA-1273 against Omicron in adults (e.g., 44% VE [95% CI: 35.1; 51.6%] at 14-90 days after dose 2; 
Tseng, 2022). Although it is noted that vaccine efficacy estimates for infants and children 6 months to 
under 2 years of age are more variable than for the older children 2-6 years of age, the consistency in 
vaccine efficacy seems to be applicable for both age groups (Tseng et al 2022; Andrews et al 2022). 
Nevertheless, more advanced efficacy data at a later stage should be submitted to verify this hypothesis 
and to exclude age effects.  
Severe COVID-19 is very rare in children and no such cases were reported in study P204. Accordingly, 
efficacy against (predominant Omicron-related) severe outcomes, e.g. hospitalisation and death, could 
not be determined. 
Sensitivity analyses determined VE against COVID-19 endpoints not only by RT-PCR results but also by 
test results derived only by home testing or cases lacking further test identification. Of note, VE derived 
upon these less stringent test results was similar to those determined using the prior strict case 
definitions. The increased number of cases identified in this sensitivity analysis also resulted in lower 
limits of 95% CIs that exceeded zero, supporting the assessment of VE using the protocol-specified case 
definitions.

In summary, reliable VE estimates are not available at this stage of development and current available 
efficacy results are of limited, albeit supportive, value due to the limitations noted above.  
Despite some restrictions mentioned earlier, efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in children aged ≥6 
months to <6 years are derived primarily on the basis of the co-primary immune-bridging endpoints. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the MAH provided immunogenicity and efficacy data which supports an extension of the 
indication of mRNA-1273 in children below the age of 6.  
The CHMP considers the following measure (MEA) necessary to address issues related to clinical efficacy:  
• 
The MAH should provide the results from study mRNA-1273-P204, with an analysis of the 
secondary efficacy endpoint, based on a later data cut-off date to support the immunobridging, to 
be submitted by 30/06/2023 and a final clinical study report to be submitted by 31/03/2024. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
On 06 January 2021, mRNA-1273 was granted a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 18 years of age and older. On 
23 July 2021, the indication had subsequently been extended to individuals ≥ 12 years of age 
(EMEA/H/C/005791/II/0021). On 10 November 2021 the procedure has started to extend the use of 
mRNA-1273 to include active immunisation to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
individuals 6 years to <12 years of age. This current procedure intends to extend the use of mRNA-1273 
to include active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in children 6 months to < 6 years of age. The safety 
assessment for the extension of indication of Spikevax to individuals 6 months to < 6 years of age is 
based on the submitted safety data for Study mRNA-1273-P204 (hereafter referred to as P204). P204 is 
an ongoing Phase 2/3, 2-part, open-label, dose-escalation, age de-escalation and subsequent 
randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in healthy children 6 months to less than 12 years of 
age. The study population in P204 comprises 3 age groups (6 years to < 12 years, 2 years to < 6 years, 
and 6 months to < 2 years). This submission focus on children 6 months to < 6 years of age, grouped in 
the age groups 2 years to < 6 years, and 6 months to < 2 years as mentioned above. Subjects in this 
age cohort were recruited in the USA during predominance of the Delta variant. Main exclusion criteria 
were hypersensitivity against any component of the vaccine, liver disease, congenital or acquired 
immunodeficiency and bleeding disorders. The study design of P204 in the younger age cohorts was 
similar to the design for the 6 years to < 12 year of age cohort. The study followed a pattern of age de-
escalation, the older children (2 to < 6 years) were enrolled to Part 1 (to evaluate dose levels of 25 µg 
and 50 µg administered as a two-dose schedule one month apart, prior to younger children (6 months to 
< 2 years). Accordingly, a lower dose (25 µg) was evaluated in a group of 2 years to < 6 years old 
children in Part 1, a dose that proved less reactogenic than 2 injections of 50 µg of mRNA-1273. The 
youngest children (6 months to < 2 years) received 25 µg of mRNA-1273 in Part 1. In the blinded 
expansion phase (Part 2), participants received mRNA-1273 or placebo administered as 2 IM injections 
approximately 28 days apart at the selected dose level. Prior to the start of Part 2 Protocol Amendment 3 
was implemented including enhanced surveillance for symptoms suggestive of possible myocarditis or 
pericarditis, based on individual symptoms that are components of the US CDC working case definition for 
myocarditis and pericarditis observed following COVID-19 vaccination (Gargano et al 2021).

Data snapshot for this analysis is 21 Feb 2022. 
Study population  
Children with chronic disease (e.g., asthma, diabetes mellitus, cystic fibrosis, bronchial hyperactivity) 
were not excluded in the trial, but the disease should be stable. Stable diseases were defined in the CTP 
as those, which have had no change in their status in the medications required to control them in the 6 
months prior to Screening Visit. Literature indicates that in adults, obesity is associated with worse 
outcomes in COVID
19. There is a paucity of clinical data available to fully understand the risk factors and 
disease course in the paediatric population.  
‑
Age Group 6 months < 2 years old 
In part 1 of the trial no children with medical history were enrolled. In part 2 no obese children were 
enrolled and regarding to the medical history more children were enrolled in the mRNA-1273 vaccine 
group versus placebo group respectively 27 children (1.3%) compared to 2 children (0.3%) for chronic 
lung diseases and for the diagnosis of asthma were enrolled 22 children (1.2%) in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared to 2 children (0.3%) in the placebo group. 
Age Group 2 years to < 6 years old  
In Part 1 for both dose groups were enrolled 27 children obese with BMI >95th percentile; 9 children with 
chronic lung diseases; 8 children with asthma and no participant with diabetes mellitus. In part 2 of the 
trial, 106 children (10.5%) in the placebo and 326 children (10.8%) in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
were obese with BMI >95th percentile. The proportion of obese/non-obese children in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group was 326 out of a total of 3031 children comparable with the number of 106 out of 1007 in 
the placebo group. With regard to medical history the placebo and the number of participants enrolled 
was higher in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group versus placebo respectively with 103 (3.4%) children 
compare to 46 (4.6%) children for chronic lung diseases (including asthma) and 92 (3%) children versus 
42 (2.2%) children for the diagnosis of asthma (including bronchial hyperactivity). The number of 
children enrolled for diabetes mellitus was similar with 1 participant for both mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
and placebo group.  
Individuals with known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection within 2 weeks prior to administration of IP or 
known close contact with anyone with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 within 2 
weeks prior to administration of IP were to be excluded, but SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at baseline was 
not an exclusion criterion. For the age cohort 6 Months to < 2 Years: in part 1 of the trial, 94% of 
participants were seronegative at baseline, 4.7% were seropositive and for 1.3% the SARS-CoV-2 
baseline status is not known. In part 2: 90% of participants in the placebo group and 89.4 % in the 25 µg 
dose group were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, 6.5% versus 6% were seropositive, and for 3.6 
% versus 4.5 % children in the 25 µg dose group, the SARS-CoV-2 baseline status is not known. 
For the age cohort 2 years to < 6 years old: in part 1 of the trial, 92.8% of participants in the 25µg and 
94.8% in the 50µg dose group were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, 7.2% versus 3.9% were 
seropositive, and for 2 (1.3%) participants in the 50µg dose group, the SARS-CoV-2 baseline status is not 
known. In part 2, 89.2% of participants in the placebo group and 88.9 % in the 25 µg dose group were 
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline, 8.1% versus 8.8 % were seropositive, and for 2.7% versus 2.3% 
participants in the 25 µg dose group, the SARS-CoV-2 baseline status is not known.

Safety analysis set 
All safety analyses in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study are based on the Safety Set, except summaries of 
solicited ARs, which are based on the Solicited Safety Set. The safety set consists of all enrolled 
participants (in Part 1) and all randomly assigned participants (in Part 2) who receive at least 1 dose of 
IP. The Solicited Safety Set consists of participants in the Safety Set who contributed any solicited AR 
data. Beside the Solicited Safety Set there are two more Solicited Safety Sets. The first Injection Solicited 
Safety Set comprises of all participants in the Solicited Safety Set who have received the first study 
injection and have contributed any solicited AR data from the time of first study injection through the 
following 6 days. The Second Injection Solicited Safety Set includes all participants in the Solicited Safety 
Set who have received the second study injection and have contributed any solicited AR data from the 
time of second study injection through the following 6 days. 
Adverse events  
The P204 paediatric study evaluates the collection of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) 
for 7 days following each and any dose. All unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were to be collected for 28 
days following each injection and serious adverse events (SAEs), medically attended AEs (MAAEs), AEs of 
special interest (AESIs), and AEs leading to withdrawals are collected for the study duration. At each 
injection visit, participants’ parent(s) were to be instructed on thermometer (oral/tympanic) usage to 
measure body temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration 
(hardness), and assessment for localised axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection 
arm/thigh. AEs were to be recorded by the participants parent(s) via eDiary. The eDiary was adapted for 
use in paediatric populations from the eDiary used in the Study P301 submission for adults ≥ 18 years of 
age. Severity assessment of solicited ARs was to be performed according to Guidance for industry -

Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine 
Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007) modified for use in children 37 months to < 12 years of age. The 
determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs was to be performed upon medical judgment based on 
predefined severity definitions in the CTP. Per protocol, all solicited ARs (local and systemic) were to be 
considered vaccine related. For unsolicited AEs causality assessment was to be performed by the 
investigator according to classification predefined in the CTP. 
Solicited adverse reactions 
Solicited local ARs assessed included pain, erythema, swelling, and axillary swelling or tenderness. The 
local ARs assessed were the same across all ages of the study. Solicited systemic ARs were categorised in 
two different sets depending on the participants’ age. For participants aged 37 months and older, the 
solicited systemic ARs assessed included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, and 
nausea/vomiting. For participants aged 2 years to ≤ 36 months, the solicited systemic ARs assessed were 
fever, irritability/crying, sleepiness, and loss of appetite. Protocol-defined fever grades in participants 
aged 2 years to ≤ 36 months were the following: grade 1 = 38°C to 38.5°C, grade 2 = 38.6°C to 39.5°C, 
grade 3 = 39.6°C to 40°C, and grade 4 > 40.0°C. Protocol-defined fever grades in participants aged 37 
months to < 6 years were the following: grade 1 = 38°C to 38.4°C, grade 2 = 38.5°C to 38.9°C, grade 3 
= 39°C to 40°C, and grade 4 > 40°C. The systemic toxicity scales for the children 37 months to < 6 
years of age were taken from the US FDA Guidance for industry Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult 
and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials (DHHS 2007), while the toxicity 
scales for children 6 to ≤ 36 months of age were per the Sponsor’s internal clinical standards. Any 
solicited AR that met either of the following criteria was also included in the analysis of unsolicited AEs: 1) 
solicited local or systemic ARs within an onset within 7 days but persisting beyond 7 days or an AR 
meeting the SAE criteria. 1) Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days post-injection 2) solicited 
local or systemic AR meeting SAE criteria. These events appear in both solicited AR and unsolicited AE 
tables. 
Solicited Local Adverse Reactions (6 Months to < 2 Years)  
Part 1 
The incidence of solicited local ARs was slightly higher after dose 2 than dose 1. The most common 
solicited local AR was injection site pain, after any dose and the majority of solicited local ARs were grade 
1 or 2. Three participants who received the 25-µg dose level of mRNA-1273 experienced grade 3 solicited 
local ARs after dose 2: erythema in 1 participant and swelling in 2 participants. There were no grade 4 
solicited local ARs in Part 1. The majority of the solicited local ARs in participants in both groups occurred 
within the first 2 days after each dose and persisted for a median of 2 days in the 25-µg group. The only 
reported local ARs in Part 1 persisting beyond 7 days after dose 1 were erythema and axillary (or groin) 
swelling or tenderness (of note, no placebo group available, only 25 ug had been analysed).

Table 29: Summary of Solicited Local Adverse Reactions (Part 1 – First Injection Solicited Safety Set, 
Second Injection Solicited Safety Set) (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
Part 2  
Solicited local ARs were more common in the mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group. Solicited local 
ARs in both groups were mostly grade 1 and 2; grade 3 local ARs occurred in a higher percentage of 
participants in the mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group. No grade 4 solicited local ARs were 
reported in Part 2 of the study. In the mRNA-1273 group, the percentage of participants experiencing 
overall and grade 3 solicited local ARs was higher after the second dose compared with the first dose. 
After any dose, the most common solicited local AR was injection site pain; the most common grade 3 
solicited local ARs were erythema and swelling. No grade 3 events of injection site pain or axillary (or 
groin) swelling or tenderness were reported in either treatment group. After any dose, the majority of the 
solicited local ARs that occurred within 7 days in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 had an onset within the 
first day after any dose. Solicited local ARs persisting beyond 7 days after any dose occurred infrequently; 
1.2% of participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 0.3%in the placebo group. In the mRNA-1273 group, 
there was a similar number of participants with persisting solicited ARs persisting beyond 7 days after 
dose 1 (1.2%) and dose 2 (1.2%), and in the placebo group (0.3%) of participants had persisting events 
persisting after dose 1 (with no participants with persisting events after dose 2). In the mRNA-1273 
group, the most frequently reported event persisting beyond 7 days was axillary (or groin) swelling or

tenderness, all of which were mild (grade 1) with a similar number of events reported after dose 1 and 
dose 2 (dose 1: 14 events, 0.8%; and dose 2:16 events, 1.0%). This was compared to 1 (0.2%) mild 
event in the placebo group. In the mRNA-1273 group, 1.4% of participants reported solicited local ARs 
with onset after 7 days after dose 1. No participants reported solicited local ARs with onset after 7 days 
after dose 2. The ARs with onset after 7 days reported after any dose were pain (0.2%), erythema 
(redness) (0.9%), swelling (hardness) (0.4%), and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness (0.2%). In 
the placebo group, no solicited local ARs with onset after 7 days were reported after any dose.

Solicited local ARs (2- to < 6-years-old) 
Part 1 
The incidences of the solicited local ARs were higher after any dose in the 50-μg group compared to the 
25-μg group. In both mRNA-1273 dose groups, the incidence of solicited local ARs was higher after dose 
2 than dose 1 and the majority of solicited local ARs in both groups were grade 1 or 2 in severity. All 
grade 3 solicited local ARs were reported in the 50-μg group. There were no grade 4 solicited local ARs 
after any dose in any group in Part 1. After any dose, the most common solicited AR was injection site 
pain. Pain was the only grade 3 solicited local AR and 2 events of grade 3 pain occurred in the 50-μg 
group. The majority of the solicited local ARs in participants in both groups occurred within the first 2 
days after any dose and persisted for a median of 2 days in both dose groups. Individual solicited local 
ARs persisting beyond 7 days, all of which occurred in in the 50-μg group, included injection site 
erythema, swelling, and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness after dose 1. Solicited local ARs 
persisting beyond 7 days after dose 2 were from 2 participants who reported grade 1 injection site 
axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness.

Injection Solicited Safety Set) (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
Part 2  
The solicited local ARs were more common in the mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group after both 
doses. Solicited local ARs in both groups were mostly grade 1 and 2 in severity. In the mRNA-1273 
group, the percentage of participants experiencing grade 3 solicited local ARs was higher after dose 2 
when compared to dose 1 (1.2% versus 0.8%, respectively). After any dose, the most common solicited 
local AR was injection site pain; the most common grade 3 solicited local ARs were erythema, swelling, 
and pain. No grade 4 solicited local ARs were reported for either group in Part 2 of the study. The 
majority of the solicited local ARs in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 had a time to onset of 1 day after 
any dose with an event duration median of 2 days. The majority of the solicited local ARs in the placebo 
group also had a time to onset within 1 day of any dose with a median event duration of 1 day. Solicited 
local ARs persisting beyond 7 days occurred infrequently, in <1% of participants in either treatment 
group. In the mRNA-1273 group, solicited local ARs persisting beyond 7 days after dose 1 included 
injection site pain, erythema, swelling, and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness and in the placebo 
group, included injection site pain and axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness. Solicited local ARs 
persisting beyond 7 days after dose 2 in the mRNA-1273 group included injection site pain, swelling, and 
axillary (or groin) swelling or tenderness while in the placebo group, there was a single event of injection

site pain persisting beyond 7 days after dose 2. In the mRNA-1273 group, 1.3% of participants reported 
solicited local ARs with onset after 7 days after dose 1. Fewer (0.1%) participants after dose 2 reported 
solicited local ARs with onset after 7 days. Only (< 0.1%) participant in the placebo group reported 
solicited local ARs with onset after 7 days post any dose and the reported was injection site erythema 
(redness).

Solicited Systemic Adverse Reactions (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
Part 1 
The overall incidences of solicited systemic ARs were similar after doses 1 and 2, occurring in the majority 
of participants receiving mRNA-1273 (71.8% after dose 1, versus 69.3% after dose 2). Grade 3 solicited 
systemic ARs were more common after dose 2 (2.0%) compared with after dose 1 (0.7%). 
Irritability/crying was the most commonly reported event, occurring in over 60% of participants after

each dose. There was one event of Grade 3 fever occurring in a 1-year-old male [FLD1]that started after 
the second dose on day 6 and resolved on post-dose day 8. The event was reported as moderate in 
intensity and related to vaccination. No other concurrent AEs were reported. No grade 4 solicited systemic 
ARs were reported in Part 1 of the study. The majority of the solicited systemic ARs in participants in Part 
1 occurred within the first 2 days after each dose at both dose levels and persisted for a median of 3.0 
days in the mRNA-1273 25 µg group. Solicited systemic ARs persisting beyond 7 days after any dose 
(11.3%) of participants were irritability/crying, loss of appetite, sleepiness, and fever. Irritability/crying 
was the most commonly reported of these, occurring in 12/150 (8.0%) participants. There were 2 grade 
3 events of loss of appetite. Two participants (1.3%) reported solicited systemic ARs of fever with onset 
after 7 days after any dose.

Part 2 
The overall incidences of solicited systemic ARs were similar in the mRNA-1273 group (88.5%) and the 
placebo group (84.4%). In the mRNA-1273 group, solicited systemic ARs were similar after doses 1 
(76.4%) and 2 (73.6%), and in the placebo group the incidence was slightly higher after dose 1 (72.3%) 
compared to dose 2 (66.5%). The majority of solicited systemic ARs were grade 1 to grade 2 in severity. 
Grade 3 and higher solicited systemic ARs after any dose were more common in the mRNA-1273 group 
(5.1%) than in the placebo group (3.8%). After any dose, the most frequently reported solicited systemic 
AR were similar between placebo and mRNA-1273: irritability/crying (77.7% vs 81.5%), followed by 
sleepiness (52.1% vs 51.1%), and loss of appetite (40.8% vs 45.7%). Incidences of grade 3 solicited 
systemic ARs of fever (1.5% vs 1.0%) and sleepiness (0.3% vs 0.3%). Grade 3 solicited systemic ARs of 
loss of appetite (placebo:0.5%; mRNA-1273: 1.4%) and irritability/crying (placebo: 1.7%; mRNA-
1273:2.8%) were higher in the mRNA-1273 group. The only grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported 
for fever and they were similar with 0.2% for both groups. The majority of the solicited systemic ARs in 
participants in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 occurred within the first 2 days after any dose and 
persisted for a median of 2.0 days in the placebo group and 3.0 days in the mRNA-1273 group. Solicited 
systemic ARs persisting beyond 7 days after any dose were reported for 11.5% of participants in the 
placebo group and 12.6% of participants in the mRNA-1273 group, and were reported in similar 
proportions for fever (0.9% vs 1.7%), irritability/crying (8.7% vs 9.3%), sleepiness (2.6% vs2.0%), and 
loss of appetite (4.8% vs 3.9%). After any dose, 0.3% of participants in the placebo group and 0.7% of 
participants in the mRNA-1273 group reported solicited systemic ARs with onset after Day 7. Loss of 
appetite (0.3%) was the only event reported in the placebo group, and the most frequently reported 
solicited systemic AR in the mRNA-1273 group was fever (0.5%) followed by irritability/crying (0.2%), 
sleepiness (< 0.1%), and loss of appetite (< 0.1%).

Analysis of Fever in Part 2 (6 Months to < 2 Years)  
Most fevers (defined as temperature ≥ 38°C, tympanic method of management preferred) were reported 
on Day 1 and 2 after either dose, and in both the mRNA-1273 and the placebo group. After both doses, 
the rate of fevers reported was higher in the mRNA-1273 group compared to the placebo group. For the 
remaining 5 days after Day 2 for either dose, the reported fever rates were similar between the mRNA-
1273 group and the placebo group. Most of these participants reported a fever < 39°C, with a higher rate 
reported in the mRNA-1273 group after both dose 1 and dose 2. The rates of fevers between 39°C and 
40°C were similar in all groups. Four participants in the mRNA-1273 group and one participant in the 
placebo group had fever of 40°C after any dose. All three fevers after Dose 2 which occurred in the 
mRNA-1273 group had additional, concurrent AEs reported that could have contributed to the incidence 
and severity of the fever (URI). One placebo recipient reported a fever over 40°C after Dose 1; this 
participant also had a concurrent AE of ‘viral rash’ reported at the time of fever.

Table 35: Onset of Fever ≥ 38°C in Part 2 (Part 2 – First Injection Solicited Safety Set, Second Injection 
Solicited Safety Set) (6 months to < 2 years) 
Local solicited ARs were reported in a higher percentage of participants in the mRNA-1273 group 
compared with the placebo group after each dose and at higher frequency after dose 2 (54.4%) 
compared to dose 1 (44.4%) in the mRNA-1273 group. Systemic ARs occurred at similar rates after doses 
1 (76.4%) and 2 (73.6%) in the mRNA-1273 group. The majority of solicited ARs were grade 1 or grade 
2. The incidence of grade 3 solicited ARs was infrequent in both groups (< 5%) and slightly higher in the 
mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group after any dose. 
Solicited systemic ARs (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
Part 1 
Overall solicited systemic ARs were more common after dose 2 than dose 1 at both dose levels and in 
both age groups (25 and 50 μg RNA-1273). The most commonly reported event in the 24-month- to ≤ 
36-month-old age group occurring after either dose or dose level was irritability. The most commonly 
occurring Grade 3 event in this younger age group was fever, occurring only in the 50-μg group after 
both doses (4.2% after dose 1 and 11.5% after dose 2). In the 37-month- to < 6-year-old group, the 
most commonly occurring event after either dose or dose level was fatigue. The most commonly 
occurring Grade 3 event in this age group was fever after dose 2, occurring in 1.7% in the 25-μg group 
and 6.3% in the 50-μg group. Advancement of the 25-ug dose to Part 2 was based on the balance of 
reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Regarding reactogenicity of the two dosages, the higher rate and 
severity of solicited systemic ARs in the 50-μg group compared to the 25-μg group (particularly for fever) 
contributed to advancement of 25-μg to Part 2.

dose 2 than dose 1; in the placebo group event rates were higher after dose 1 compared to dose 2 (Table 
39). For both the mRNA-1273 and placebo group, most solicited systemic ARs were grade 1 to 2 in 
severity. In the younger age group (2-years to ≤ 36-months), after any dose, the most common solicited 
systemic ARs in either group, occurring in >20% of participants, were irritability/crying, sleepiness and 
loss of appetite. The most common grade 3 solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273 group after any 
dose in >1% of participants in at least one dose group were irritability/crying, and fever ≥39.0°C; in the 
placebo group these were fever ≥39.0°C and irritability/crying. In the older age group (37-month- to < 
6-years), after any dose, the most common solicited systemic AR was fatigue in >20% of participants. 
The most common grade 3 solicited systemic ARs, occurring in >1% of participants in at least one dose 
group, in the mRNA-1273 group were fatigue and fever and in the placebo group was fatigue. Fever was 
the only grade 4 solicited systemic AR reported in either group. Most solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-
1273 group occurred within the first 2 days after either dose and lasted for a median of 2 days. Solicited 
systemic ARs persisting beyond 7 days after any dose were reported in similar proportions in the placebo 
group (5.8%) as in the mRNA-1273 group (4.7%). Participants reporting solicited systemic ARs with 
onset after 7 days after any dose was similar in the mRNA-1273 and placebo group with 0.4%. Systemic 
ARs reported with an onset after 7 days after any dose in the mRNA-1273 group included fever, fatigue, 
irritability/crying, sleepiness, and loss of appetite, while systemic ARs reported with an onset after 7 days 
after any dose in the placebo group included events of fever, headache, and loss of appetite.

Table 38: Onset of Fever ≥38°C in Part 2 (Part 2 – First Injection Solicited Safety Set, Second Injection 
Solicited Safety Set) (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
The majority of the reported fevers were in the range of ≥ 38 to 38.9°C after any dose in both treatment 
groups. Initially there were reported 13 events of grade 4 fever events determined, therefore 3 of the 13 
fever events were incorrectly reported as grade 4, given that none of these 3 participants recorded any 
elevated temperature. The 10 confirmed events were discussed further as: 8 (0.3%) in the mRNA-1273 
group and 2 (0.2%) in the placebo group. The 8 events in the study vaccine group occurred mostly after 
dose 2, with 3 of the 8 events occurring after dose 1 and 5 of the 8 events after dose 2. Four of the 10 
events of grade 4 fever reported concurrent AEs including: 3 (of 8) in the mRNA-1273 group (upper 
respiratory tract infection; croup; bilateral viral pneumonia) and 1 (of 2) in the placebo group (COVID-19 
infection). 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
In both parts of the trial, unsolicited AEs after any dose were collected during the 28 days after each 
injection and are divided in the 2 age cohorts and respective parts.  
Unsolicited Adverse Events (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
Part 1  
The summary of unsolicited AEs reported in Part 1 is provided in the table below. MAAEs reflect those 
anticipated in paediatric populations and in a study conducted in the winter and during the Omicron 
variant surge. The most commonly reported SOC for MAAEs was infections and infestations (19.3% out of 
total of 30.0%) reflecting typical childhood infectious diseases in this age group.

Table 39: Summary of Subjects Reporting at Least One Unsolicited Adverse Event up to 28 Days After 
Any Dose (Part 1 – Safety Set) (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
The most common reported unsolicited AEs reported, i.e. those reported by more than 1% for part 1 
were: pyrexia (9.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.7%), irritability (8.0%), teething (7.3%), otitis 
media (6.0%), rhinorrhoea (6.0%), decreased appetite (6.0%), hand-foot- and foot and- mouth diseases 
(4.0%), cough (3.3%), injection site lymphadenopathy (2.7%) and the other symptoms in lower 
percentages. Four (2.7%) participants experienced 6 severe TEAEs reported within 28 days of any dose, 
including decreased appetite (2) febrile convulsion (1), this AE was also reported as an SAE. Three events 
of cough, wheezing and urticarial occurred in one participant 21 days after dose 2 and were assessed as 
not related by the investigator.  
Part 2  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs was similar between the mRNA-1273 group and the placebo group. 
Serious unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days of any dose were reported in few (0.5%) participants in the 
mRNA-1273 group and 0 participants in the placebo group. MAAEs were also reported in similar 
proportions in the two groups: 27.6% in the mRNA-1273 group and 27.3% in the placebo group.

Table 40: Summary of Subjects Reporting at Least One Unsolicited Adverse Event up to 28 Days After 
Any Dose (Part 2 – Safety Set) (6 months to < 2 years) 
The TEAEs experienced in the mRNA-1273 group were comparable with those in the placebo group. The 
unsolicited AEs higher in the placebo group compared with the mRNA-1273 group by at least 1% were: 
upper respiratory tract infection, COVID-19, and otitis media. The unsolicited AEs higher in the mRNA-
1273 group compared with the placebo group by at least 1% were: croup infectious, diarrhoea, and 
injection site lymphadenopathy. Twenty-one (1.2%) participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 4 (0.7%) 
participants in the placebo group reported at least 1 severe TEAE within 28 days of any dose during Part 
2. Unsolicited severe TEAEs in the mRNA-1273 group of Part 2 had the following PTs: respiratory tract 
infection viral, bronchiolitis, gastroenteritis viral, mastoiditis, pneumonia, respiratory syncytial virus 
infection, rhinovirus infection, food allergy, decreased appetite, electrolyte imbalance, irritability, febrile 
convulsion, urticaria, pyrexia, and radial head dislocation. All events were reported once except for 
irritability (n = 8, 0.5%), decreased appetite (n = 3, 0.2%), and febrile convulsion (n = 2, 0.1%). 
Unsolicited severe TEAEs in the placebo group of Part 2 had the following PTs: respiratory tract infection 
viral, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, decreased appetite, irritability, and pyrexia. The only event occurring 
more than once was pyrexia (n = 2, 0.3%) both occurring at Day 7 after most recent dose of IP and both 
considered related. The TEAEs involving RTIs up to 28 days showed comparable frequencies in reporting 
rates, therefore imbalances of several respiratory related infections were noted, occurring with greater 
frequency in the mRNA-1273 group compared to the placebo group. According to MAH the 3:1 
randomisation scheme, low event rates, and multiple comparisons all increase the possibility that these

Unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related (6 Months to < 2 years)  
 Part 1 
The most common AEs considered being vaccine related in Part 1 of the study reported within 28 days 
included irritability (7.3%), decreased appetite (4.7%), injection site lymphadenopathy (2.7%) and 
somnolence (2.7%). According to MAH the majority of AEs were consistent with the known reactogenicity 
profile of mRNA-1273. 
Part 2  
Mostly the AEs considered being vaccine related in Part 2 reported within 28 days were balanced between 
the placebo and mRNA-1273 groups. The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered being 
vaccine related in both groups belonged to the SOC were: general and administration disorders with 4.7% 
in the mRNA-1273 group and 1.4% in the placebo group and the leading symptoms in this SOC were 
pyrexia with 1.5 % vs 0.7%, followed by injection site lymphadenopathy (1.4 % vs 0.2%), injection site 
erythema (1.1 % versus 0.2%), injection site induration (0.5% versus 0.2 %). The second most common 
SOC was skin and cutaneous disorders with 0.6% in the mRNA-1273 group versus 0.2% in the placebo 
group. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
Part 1 
As of 21st February 2022, a total of 23.2% of participants in the 25-µg group of Part 1 and 36.1% of 
participants in the 50-µg group reported at least 1 unsolicited TEAE. The incidence of medically attended 
adverse events (MAAEs) was lower in the 25-µg group compared to the 50-µg group (7.2 % versus 
20.6%). The most commonly reported SOC for MAAEs was infections and infestations (19.3% out of 
30.0%) reflecting typical childhood infectious diseases in this age group. In the 25-µg group, 7.2% of 
participants reported at least 1 TEAE determined by the investigator to be related to IP compared to 11% 
of participants in the 50-µg group. None of the experienced MAAEs in the 25-µg group experienced were 
considered to be related to IP or severe TEAEs while in the 50-µg group, 1.9% participants reported 
MAAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study IP and 2.6% participants experienced severe 
TEAEs within 28 days of any dose, 1.9% of which were considered related to study vaccine.

higher in the 50-µg group compare to the 25-µg group: upper respiratory tract infection (7.7% vs 0), 
pyrexia (7.7% vs 2.9%), injection site erythema (4.5% vs 4.3%), cough (3.9% vs 5.8%), rhinorrhoea 
(3.9% vs 1.4%). Four participants in the 50-µg group experienced severe TEAEs: 2 events of fatigue and 
2 events of pyrexia. Two of the events of fatigue and one event of pyrexia were considered related to 
study IP by the investigator and all events were considered resolved or recovered according to the 
investigator. 
Part 2  
The experienced unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days after vaccination were in similar proportions of 
participants in the mRNA-1273 (40.0%) and in the placebo group (37.5%). MAAEs considered related to 
study vaccination were reported in a higher proportion of participants in the mRNA-1273 group (1.0%)

after injection and were generally related to childhood illnesses according to the investigator. 
TEAEs involving respiratory tract infections (RTIs) up to 28 days showed imbalances of several respiratory 
related infections occurring with greater frequency in the mRNA-1273 group compared to the placebo

and administration site conditions (5.8% versus 10.3 % subjects) in the 25µg and the 50µg dose 
group).Leading symptom in this SOC in the 50µg dose group vs 25µg dose was injection site erythema 
(4.5% vs 4.3%), followed by fatigue (1.9% vs 0), injection site swelling( 1.3% vs 1.4%), while chest pain 
was reported in 1 participant (1.4%) in the 25µg dose and no participants in the 50µg dose group.  
Part 2 
The incidence of AEs being vaccine related to Part 2 were comparable between the mRNA-1273 group and 
the placebo group (9.4% vs 7.9%, respectively). The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs considered 
being vaccine related in both groups belonged to the SOC of General disorders and administration site 
conditions (5.6% of subjects versus 3.9% of subjects) in the mRNA-1273 group and the placebo group. 
Leading symptom in this SOC in the placebo group compared to the mRNA-1273 group were fatigue 
(2.1% vs 1.5%), pyrexia (1.5% vs 1.2%) while chest pain was not experienced in the placebo group and 
to 2 participants (<0.1) in the mRNA-1273 group. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events/ deaths in Part 1 (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
In the mRNA-1273 vaccine group, a total of 1.3% in Part 1 and 0.5% in Part 2 experienced SAEs and the 
events reported were either consistent with childhood disease or could be explained by pre-existing 
conditions and not be related with the study vaccine by the investigator. In Part 2, no SAEs were reported 
in the placebo group. No deaths have been reported in the study.  
Part 1 
Two participants reported 4 SAEs in the vaccine group that occurred within the 28-day. A 7-month-old 
male in the vaccine group experienced 3 severe (grade 3) concurrent SAEs of cough, wheezing, and 
urticaria 21 days after dose 2. These events were considered to be due to an anaphylactic reaction to 
food[FLD2] and have been resolved within the same day. A 1-year-old male in the vaccine study group 
experienced a severe (grade 3) SAE of febrile convulsion of 5 minutes’ duration 10 days after dose 2. The 
participant first developed a maculo-papular rash, with an onset 2 days the event of febrile seizure 
(39°C) and has been hospitalised. In the vaccine study group, 1 SAE (grade 2) of rhinovirus infection with 
an onset of more than 28 days after dose 2 (149 days after dose 2) has been reported in a 1-year-old 
Assessment report

female. The participant was hospitalised due to respiratory distress and bronchiolitic symptoms and was 
also diagnosed with left otitis media. 
Part 2  
In part 2, overall, there have been 9 reported SAEs experienced by eight participants in the study vaccine 
group within the 28-day follow-up period after any dose. Two events reported in the same participant 
(fever and febrile seizure) where considered related to the study vaccine in the assessment from the 
investigator. The participant a 1-year- old female in the vaccine group[FLD3], approximately 6 hours after 
dose 1 experienced a severe SAE of fever (temperature of 103.1°F), that persisted until the next day 
when the parent/guardian[FLD4] heard the child crying, describing that the child was limp[FLD5]. At the 
emergency room the participant vitals revealed heart rate 170 beats per minute, temperature 39.1°C, 
respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% and the diagnosis of febrile seizure 
was established by the ER physician. Treatment for the pyrexia and febrile convulsion included 
paracetamol and ibuprofen, the participant stayed 4 hours in ER for observation and the two events were 
resolved two days after the onset[FLD6]. In the sponsor position it was stated that this case was 
confounded by an additional mild (grade 1) AE of rash maculo-papular on trunk that was reported 3 days 
after the event of fever. Even though the vaccine is known to cause fever, a differential diagnosis should 
include a viral illness, e.g. HHV6. This disease is characterized by three to five days of high fever that 
resolves abruptly and is followed by development of a rash. HHV-6 infection has been associated with 
febrile seizures. The investigator assessed the events of pyrexia and febrile convulsion to be related to 
the IP while the Sponsor does not agree with the Investigator assessment that the event of febrile seizure 
was related to the IP. Given the short TTO of the fever and the additional AE of rash macular-papular 
suggestive of a viral illness, these confounders provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of 
the reported events. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data cut.  
The other 7 SAEs (grade 3) assessed as not related to the study vaccine within the 28-day were 
diagnosed as following: febrile convulsion; electrolyte imbalance secondary to dehydration in the setting 
of RSV infection; metapneumovirus infection; foreign body in respiratory tract; mastoiditis in the setting 
of neutropenia and adenovirus infection; bronchiolitis; rhinovirus infection. The SAEs with an onset of 
more than 28 days after any dose were 7 events in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group and 1 event in the 
placebo group in the participants were considered not related to mRNA-1273 by the investigator.  
No deaths have been reported in the study as of the data snapshot, 21st February 2022. 
Discontinuation From IP or Study Participation 
No participants aged 6 months to < 2 years old in Part 1 were discontinued the study and in part 2 there 
were 3 participants withdrawn the study, one in the study vaccine group and the 2 others in the placebo 
group. The participant in the mRNA-1273 vaccine group, a 1-year-old male, [FLD7]experienced an 
unsolicited TEAE of urticaria of mild intensity (rash on torso) that started the same day as dose 1 leading 
to discontinuation from study vaccine and no treatment was reported for urticaria. The event has been 
assessed as related to the study vaccine by the investigator and the event was considered to be resolved 
on the next day[FLD8]. 
Two other participants in the placebo group experienced TEAE of COVID-19 leading to discontinuation 
from study vaccine. The participant, a 7-month-old [FLD9]female, ten days after the 1st dose of the 
vaccine, on [FLD10]Study Day 10, experienced a mild TEAE of COVID-19 and the treatment included 
ibuprofen and paracetamol. The event of COVID-19 was considered to be resolved on [FLD11]Study Day 
20. The event was not related to the IP according to the investigator, and the withdrawal from study on 
[FLD12]Study Day 27 was due to dose delay and relocation[FLD13]. The other case of withdrawn the study

due to TEAE of COVID-19 started 10 days after dose 1 and the event was not related to study IP 
according to the investigator. The narrative for the last case in the placebo group is not provided. 
Serious Adverse Events/ deaths in Study (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
In part 1, no SAEs were reported for this age group  
In part 2, in the study vaccine group there were in total 6 SAEs reported from 4 participants within 28 
days of any dose. All six events were reported as resolved and none were considered related to the study 
vaccine by the investigator. The 6 SAEs cases reported were reported as per below:  
The event of severe (grade 3) metapneumovirus infection was reported in a 3-year-old female participant 
that started 8 days after dose 1. T[FLD14]he participant started having cough and fever (body 
temperature not reported) and was treated with respiratory fluticasone propionate and salbutamol. The 
participant has been diagnosed [FLD15]with human metapneumovirus. The next day[FLD16], the 
participant visited the primary care physician and resulted negative for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. 
[FLD17]Three days later the participant was hospitalised and was put on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula 
and later increased to 4 L. Additional treatments included dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate and 
was discharged[FLD18], 8 days after the start of the event. 
The event of a viral pneumonia with bronchial hyperreactivity and respiratory distress (all severe, grade 
3), was reported in a 2-year-old male and has started 14 days after the 1st vaccine dose. T[FLD19]he 
participant had rhinorrhoea, congestion, and wet cough and was treated orally with ibuprofen and 
paracetamol. After 2 days[FLD20] the participant had fever (max 106.3°F), presented the next day to the 
primary physician and has been diagnosed with viral left lower lobe pneumonia and left acute suppurative 
otitis media and was treated with amoxicillin. [FLD21]Two days later the participant developed respiratory 
distress and reactive airway disease, and he developed high fever the night before, purple lips, decreased 
energy, tachypnea, belly breathing, tracheal tugging, chest tightness, perioral cyanosis and was 
hospitalised the same day. Treatment included rectal paracetamol for fever and IV dexamethasone and 
respiratory salbutamol and participant was discharged two days later. [FLD22] 
Placebo Group 
within 28 days of any dose, 1 participant in the placebo group experienced 1 SAE of moderate (grade 2) 
abdominal wall abscess was experienced by a 2-year-old male participant which started 28 days after 
dose 2 and led to hospitalisation (Table 49). The event was considered resolved after 29 days and was 
not considered related to study IP by the investigator. One participant in the placebo group, a 2-year-old 
female, experienced 2 SAEs after 28 days following any dose. The events, both requiring hospitalisation, 
included a severe (grade 3) rhinovirus infection and a moderate (grade 2) asthma. Both events started 
83 days after dose 2 and resolved with sequelae (intermittent asthma) after 14 days. The events were 
not considered to be related to study IP by the investigator. Beyond 28 days after dose 2, 5 participants 
experienced 5 SAEs. All of these events required hospitalisation. All events resolved and were not 
considered related to mRNA-1273 by the investigator. The events included: 
No deaths have been reported in the study as of the data snapshot.  
Discontinuation From IP or Study Participation 
No participant in Part 1 was discontinued from IP or the study due to an AE. In Part 2 one participant, a 
4-year-old-male in the vaccine group, on [FLD23]Study Day 1 experienced a mild AE of urticaria [FLD24] 
on the same day as dose 1 leading to discontinuation from study vaccine. Treatment for the urticaria 
included levocetirizine (1.25 mg, oral, once on Study Day 1[FLD25]) and ibuprofen (150 mg, oral, once on

Study Day[FLD26] 1). The second IP dose was withdrawn due to the urticarial and the event was 
considered related to study IP by the investigator. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
AESIs were assessed as those occurring within 28 days of any injection and across the study duration. 
In part 1 of the study, in the vaccine group one participant, a 1-year-old male experienced 1, severe AESI 
(also an SAE for overnight hospitalisation) of febrile convulsion that started 10 days after dose 2. An 
event of rash maculo-papular was reported with an onset 2 days before the event of febrile seizure, fever 
39°C was documented, the electroencephalogram has resulted normal. Treatment included oral 
paracetamol and ibuprofen. The participant was discharged and the event was determined by the 
investigator to not be related to the study vaccine.  
In part 2 of the study, 3 AESIs were reported by 3 participants in the vaccine group within 28 days and 
one additional was reported by 1 participant across the study duration. One severe grade 3 AESI and SAE 
of febrile convulsion of 5 minutes’ duration was reported in a 1-year-old male 21 days after dose 1. 
[FLD27]The participant experienced febrile seizures with the highest fever at 101.0°F for the next 2 days. 
At hospital, unspecified tests have been conducted and treatment included paracetamol. Consultations 
with Infectious disease specialist and rheumatologist have been done with some suspected diagnoses but 
not a finalised one. There is not clear information if the second IP dose was only a delay or it has not 
been administered to the subject. There is also misleading information if the event was related or not to 
the IP based on the narrative information. 
 Another case with febrile convulsion was reported in a 1-year-old female, approximately 6 hours after 
receiving the 1st dose. The same case is described in details in the section of the SAEs. A mild AESI of 
liver injury was reported in a 9-month-old female, [FLD28]occurring 2 days after dose 2. Prior the 
participant has a viral gastroenteritis-type illness and has been recommended that subject’s LFTs be 
monitored while breastfeeding. The [FLD29]laboratory results required by her primary doctor on the 
previous day resulted with these abnormal values alanine aminotransferase: 390 (high), aspartate 
aminotransferase: 349 (high) and [FLD30]these laboratory tests were reported on the next day as acute 
liver injury. It was also confirmed that the subject stopped breastfeeding more than 3 months prior. This 
event was determined to be related to mRNA-1273 by the investigator, although might be other multiple 
plausible causes for the increased LFTs, including recent illness (viral gastroenteritis). After 28 days,1 
moderate AESI (also a SAE), was reported in a 1-year-old male in the vaccine group, who experienced an 
erythema multiforme that occurred 35 days after dose 1 and it was determined to not be related to study 
IP by the investigator. 
In the Placebo group no AESIs were reported within 28 days one AESI was reported by 1 participant 
occurring beyond 28 days. A 1-year-old male experienced 1, severe AESI (also a SAE) of acute 
respiratory failure that occurred 29 days after dose 1 and resolved after 3 days with hospitalisation. The 
investigator assessed the event as not related to study IP. 
Other Events of Interest Reported after the Data Snapshot (6 Months to < 2 Years) 
Two events of interest in two participants were reported after the data cut of this IA: one event of MIS-C 
in the placebo group and one event of Kawasaki’s disease in the mRNA-1273 group. Both events occurred 
in participants who were 2 years old (at the time of screening), and the onset of the events were beyond 
28 days after receiving dose 2 (day 113 and day 79, respectively). The MIS-C event occurred in the 
placebo group and the Kawasaki’s disease in the mRNA-1273 group. Both events were assessed as not 
related by the Investigator.

Adverse Events of Special Interest (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
AESI were pre-specified in the CTP and were assessed as those occurring within 28 days of any injection 
and across the study duration. Events of clinical interest related to hypersensitivity, potential cardiac 
aetiology, and myocarditis and pericarditis are discussed in a separate subsection in this AR. AESI in 
Study P204 are listed in Table below.

In part 1 of the study, the AEIs were assessed for the two group doses 25-µg group and 50-µg group. No 
participants experienced an AESI within 28 days of any dose in both 2 group doses.

One mild event of epilepsy was reported beyond 28 days after any dose in a 3-year-old female 
participant. The event started 126 days after dose 2 and was reported as resolved after 13 days. The 
event was considered by the investigator to be not related to the study vaccine. 
In part 2 of the study, the AEIs were assessed in the vaccine and in the placebo group.  
Vaccine Group: Five AESIs were reported in 5 participants occurring within 28 days of any dose. 
One mild AE of food allergy was reported as not related in a 2-year-old male participant with known food 
allergy. The event occurred 17 days after dose 2 and resolved after 1 day and was reported as not related 
by the investigator.  
A SAE (mild/grade 1) event of seizure was reported in a 4-year-old male participant, 22 days after dose 2 
and the control at the emergency room resulted with a normal neurological exam, the participant was 
afebrile and well appeared. The event was considered to be not related to the study vaccine by the 
investigator. One mild event of erythema multiforme occurred in a 3-year-old female 3 days after dose 
1[FLD31]. According to the narrative the patient was taking Amoxicillin for Otitis Media[FLD32]. It was 
reported that the participant received Amoxicillin 2 days before the onset of the event. The participant 
restarted taking amoxicillin for a week one month[FLD33] later for the same diagnose of otitis media. The 
participant experienced other events of erythema multiforme, one episode occurred 36 days after dose 2 
[FLD34]and the other event occurred 45 days after dose 2 [FLD35]and was ongoing at the time of the 
assessment. All these 3 AEIs were considered to be not related to study IP by the investigator. For all the 
events cetirizine was used as treatment of choice for erythema. It is not clear why these 3 episodes have 
been assessed as not related to the study IP, for the first episode amoxicillin has been taken 2 days 
before the onset of the event while the second episode of the event started almost 4 weeks after the 
second course of amoxicillin was interrupted. Another participant, a 3-year-old male experienced a mild 
event of erythema multiforme occurred 3 days after dose 2 and it was assessed to be related to the IP.  
One event of moderate chest pain was reported in a 4-year-old male participant, five days after the 2nd 
dose of the vaccine. In the narrative submitted, the participant [FLD36]complained [FLD37]that he had 
discomfort, localised to the left side of his chest, no fever reported. The participant has been evaluated by 
a cardiologist, the electrocardiogram and high sensitivity troponin have resulted within normal limits. No 
specific follow-up was planned unless new or recurrent symptoms occurred. No treatment for the chest 
pain was reported and the event was considered by the investigator to be related to study IP.  
Placebo group:  
Two AESIs were reported in a 3-year-old female participant in 1 participant in this group occurring within 
28 days. A severe (grade 3) event of Henoch-Schönlein purpura occurred 3 days after dose 2 and was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study IP. Additionally, 5 days after dose 2, the participant 
experienced a mild (grade 1) event of glucosuria. It was considered by the investigator not to be related 
to study IP and was judged to have resulted from the use of exogenous steroids to treat the initial event 
of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The same participant experienced 2 additional AESIs, mild events of 
ageusia and anosmia occurred 45 days after dose 2 [FLD38]concurrent with moderate COVID-19 
(symptomatic) event. The two AESIs were considered not to be related to the study IP by the 
investigator. One case of MIS-C was reported in a placebo recipient 37 days after an event of 
asymptomatic COVID-19.

Events of Clinical Interest Based on the MedDRA SMQs of Hypersensitivity (6 Months to < 2 
Years)  
Part 1 
A total of 20 hypersensitivity events experienced in 15 participants (10.0%) in part 1 of the study in the 
mRNA-1273 group. None of these hypersensitivity events occurred within 48 hours of any dose. The most 
commonly reported events were: wheezing (4 [2.7%] participants), conjunctivitis (3 [2.0%] 
participants), dermatitis contact, drug eruption, eczema and urticarial have the same frequency of (2 
[1.3%] participants), and perioral dermatitis, Periorbital swelling, rash (including rash maculo-papular 
and rash vesicular) do have the same frequencies with (1 [0.7%] participants).  
One 1-year-old female, in the vaccine group experienced 2 hypersensitivity events of perioral dermatitis 
and rash vesicular that occurred 7 days after dose 1. The events were determined to be related to study 
treatment. A 7-month-old male in the vaccine group experienced 3 severe concurrent SAEs of cough, 
wheezing, and urticaria 21 days after dose 2. These events were considered to be due to an anaphylactic 
reaction to food [FLD39]and to be related to the study IP by the investigator. 
Part 2  
The hypersensitivity events were generally balanced between placebo and vaccine group. In the placebo 
group, there were 5 hypersensitivity events reported by 4 participants within 48 hours after any dose. All 
events were grade 1 and none were related to study treatment. The most commonly reported events in 
the vaccine group and placebo group are summarised in the table below: 
In the vaccine group, there were 9 hypersensitivity events (7 grade 1 and 2 grade 2 events) reported by 
9 participants within 48 hours after any dose. Four of these events (2 cases of urticaria with hives, 
[FLD40]flushing, and rash) were determined to be related to treatment, and assessed as nonserious, 
grade 1 events. There were 2 AEs of anaphylactic reaction in the vaccine group, one attributed as 
“anaphylaxis to food product” and the other as “anaphylaxis[FLD41], both not related to the study IP. 
Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis 
On July 09, 2021, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) concluded to recommend 
listing myocarditis and pericarditis as a side effect in the product information of both currently authorised 
mRNA vaccines, due to the occurrence of very rare cases in the post-marketing phase. On Dec 03, 2021, 
after a review of two large European epidemiological studies (Epi-phare, FR and Nordic registry data, DK, 
SE, NO, FI) the PRAC confirmed that the risk for both of these conditions is overall “very rare”, meaning 
that up to one in 10,000 vaccinated people may be affected. Additionally, the data show that the 
increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination is highest in younger males. 
To perform an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and pericarditis the CTP has been 
updated. Two overlapping approaches were used to interrogate all TEAEs. This included: 
1. 
narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities queries 
(MedDRA SMQs) 
2. 
an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
Sites were instructed to ask the caregiver the following question: “Has your child experienced any of the 
following symptoms since we last spoke? Chest pain, pressure or discomfort; Shortness of breath, fast 
breathing at rest, or any pain with breathing; Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.”

Events of Clinical Interest Based on MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs in (6 Months to < 
2 Years) 
Part 1 
No AEs of myocarditis or pericarditis were identified based on analysis of cases reported in Part 1 under 
the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQ. There was one participant, an 8-month-old male participant in the 
vaccine group with medical history of otitis media acute, and upper respiratory tract infection experienced 
concurrent nonserious mild AEs of dyspnoea (due to nasal congestion), pyrexia, fatigue, nasal congestion, 
rhinorrhoea, and decreased appetite, as well as cough, and diarrhoea, starting 27 days after dose 1. The 
event was considered not related to the study IP by the investigator and the participant received dose 2 
and was continuing the study at the time of the data cut. 
Table 44: Summary of PTs Within the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs – Narrow and Broad Scope (Part 1 
– Safety Set) (6 months to < 2 years) 
Part 2 
No AEs of myocarditis or pericarditis were identified in Part 2 and there were no participants in Part 2 
(placebo or mRNA-1273) that experienced an event included in both narrow and broad under the MedDRA 
Cardiomyopathy SMQ. 
Additional Analysis of Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
In this additional analysis (algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in 
the CDC working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis. Two PTs were identified in 
the safety database using the algorithm: irritability and vomiting in children < 12 years of age. For both 
Parts 1 and 2, this analysis identified only 1 participant, a 1-year-old female in the mRNA-1273 group in 
Part 2 reported PT of irritability and vomiting. This child had no relevant medical history and reported 
concurrent nonserious mild AEs of vomiting, irritability, and pyrexia 22 days after dose 2. The event of 
vomiting was resolved the same day, and the event of irritability the next day. The investigator assessed 
the events of vomiting and irritability to be not related to mRNA-1273 and the participant was continuing 
in the study at the time of the data cut. However, the information was provided in the clinical overview 
and the narrative has not been found, the MAH is required to submit the respective narrative (OC).

Myocarditis/Pericarditis – Part 2 (6 months to < 2 years) 
Events of Clinical Interest Based on the MedDRA SMQs of Hypersensitivity (2- to < 6-
year-olds) 
No events of anaphylaxis or other events indicative of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions were 
reported in Part 1. In total, 11 participants in Part 1 experienced a total of 12 events of potential 
hypersensitivity reactions. All events were reported as non-serious. The 11 participants included 1 (1.4%) 
in the 25-µg mRNA-1273 group and 10 (6.5%) in the 50-µg group. In the 25-µg group the only PT 
reported within the hypersensitivity SMQs using the narrow and broad standard was a single event of 
rhinitis allergic that was assessed by the investigator as not related to study vaccination. In the 50-µg 
group in Part 1, only one event was assessed by the investigator as related to vaccination. This was a 
mild event of injection site rash that started 11 days after dose 1 and resolved 2 days after. The 
remaining 10 events in 9 participants were assessed by the Investigator as not related to vaccination 
and, of these, 8 events in 7 participants occurred within 28 days of vaccination (median time to onset 16 
days, range 2 to 27 days). One mild (grade 1) event of urticaria papular on upper back occurred 1 day 
after dose 2 and resolved 3 days later; the aetiology was reported as unknown by the Investigator. The 
same participant developed a mild (grade 1) non-urticarial rash maculo-papular 26 days after dose 2 that 
resolved after 4 days later. Another participant experienced one event of mild (grade 1) erythema (red 
spot on right foot) 2 days after vaccination that resolved 3 days later; the Investigator confirmed this 
event was not related to the vaccination. One participant experienced an event of dermatitis 
contact[FLD42], and another participant experienced mild (grade 1) facial eczema on day 25. Two events 
of blister were reported in 2 participants and both events resolved; one event was a mild (grade 1) foot 
blister that occurred 16 days after dose 2 and the second event of blistering fingertips from an unknown 
source occurred 14 days after dose 2. One participant experienced moderate (grade 2) wheezing 27 days 
after dose 2 that resolved 5 days later; the Investigator confirmed the aetiology of this event was 
unknown. Two events of conjunctivitis occurred beyond 28 days after dose 2 (148 days and 177 days 
respectively).

Table 46: Events of Clinical Interest After Any Dose Based on the MedDRA SMQs of Hypersensitivity 
Narrow and Broad Scope in Part 1 (Part 1 – Safety Set) (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
In Part 1, only 2 events were reported on the day of or day after dose administration. These events were 
urticaria papular and erythema. The event of urticaria with the verbatim term of “urticarial mild papular 
rash on upper back” occurred in a 5-year-old female participant and started on the day of dose 2. The 
event was reported as mild, unrelated, and reported as resolved in 3 days. The event of erythema 
[FLD43]occurred in a 5-year-old female participant and started the day after dose 2. The event was 
reported as mild, not related, and reported as resolved in 3 days. Beyond 48 hours of any dose, 1 event 
was reported with the PT wheezing. The event was reported in a 2-year-old male participant 26 days 
after dose 2. The event was reported as moderate, not related, and resolved 5 days after onset. 
Part 2 
One event of anaphylactic reaction was reported in the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 with the verbatim 
term of anaphylaxis due to laxative[FLD44]. The number of participants in Part 2 reporting events within 
the narrow hypersensitivity SMQ and the combined narrow and broad hypersensitivity SMQ was 139 
(4.6%) in the mRNA-1273 group, reporting a total of 151 events, and 39 (3.9%) participants in the 
placebo group, reporting a total of 45 events, respectively (Table 53). In the mRNA-1273 group in Part 2, 
the most commonly reported PTs (> 10 events) within hypersensitivity SMQs were urticaria, 
conjunctivitis, seasonal allergy, and rash. In the placebo group in part 2, the most commonly reported 
PTs within the hypersensitivity SMQ (> 4 events) were similar to the mRNA-1273 group; conjunctivitis, 
urticaria and rash. In total, 32 (1.1%) participants in the mRNA-1273 group reported PTs included in the 
narrow and broad hypersensitivity SMQs that were considered related to study IP, all mild to moderate. 
In the placebo group, 7 (0.7%) participants reported related events in the hypersensitivity SMQs. One 
event of Henoch-Schönlein purpura was severe (grade 3), and the remaining 6 events were either mild 
(grade 1) or moderate (grade 2). In the mRNA-1273 group and the placebo group, the SOC with the 
most common hypersensitivity SMQ PTs was skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Fourteen events were reported within 48 hours of vaccination in the mRNA-1273 group, 8 of which were 
reported as related. Of these, 4 events were in the SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(urticaria, erythema, rash and rash erythematous), 2 in the SOC of general disorders and administration 
site conditions (2 events of injection site rash), 1 in the SOC of eye disorders (eye swelling), and 1 in the 
SOC of gastrointestinal disorders (lip swelling). The event of lip swelling was reported as a mild MAAEs in 
a 3-year-old male. It was reported to start on the day of dose 2 and lasted for 31 days. No other events 
were reported for this participant. In the placebo group, 8 events were reported within 48 hours of 
vaccination and, of these, one event was assessed as related by the Investigator; the event was a mild 
(grade 1) rash that started 2 days after dose 1 and resolved 2 days later. In the mRNA,1273 group, no 
participant had more than 1 event within the hypersensitivity SMQ reported the same day or the day after 
any dosing. Twelve events reported in the hypersensitivity SMQ in the mRNA-1273 group and they were 
as per below: two events of erythema multiforme which are described in details in the part of AESIs. An 
anaphylactic reaction with the verbatim term as anaphylaxis due to laxative[FLD45] reported in a 3-year-
old female participant, 32 days after dose 1 and the treatment consisted with diphenhydramine[FLD46] 
and dexamethasone and the event was considered related to study IP by the investigator. An event of 
bronchial hyperreactivity was reported in a 2-year-old male participant, 4 days after dose 1, the 
treatment was albuterol and the event was considered not related to study IP by the investigator. 
Two events, both severe of bronchial hyperreactivity and respiratory distress were reported in a 2-year-
old male participant, they occurred 14 days after dose 1, treatment included albuterol and the events 
were considered not related to study IP by the investigator. Other 5 events of bronchial hyperreactivity 
were reported with an onset >7 days after the last dose and were considered not related to study IP by 
the investigator. Four events of hypersensitivity were reported in the mRNA group and included in the 
verbatim term of “seasonal or environmental allergies” and all events were considered not related to 
study IP by the investigator. An event of drug hypersensitivity, [FLD47]was reported in a 4-year-old 
female participant, 29 days after dose 2 and the treatment included diphenhydramine [FLD48]and the 
event was considered not related to study IP by the investigator. 
Cases of Clinical Interest Based on MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs (2- to < 6- year-
olds) 
Part 1  
The events recorded within the enhance surveillance for myocarditis/pericarditis based on 
cardiomyopathy SMQ for part 1 are summarised in Table 47 below.

No cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in part 1 of the study. There were 2 participants in 
total in Part 1 who reported events included within the Cardiomyopathy SMQ, both narrow and broad, one 
per each group dose.  
In the 25-µg group, there was one 4-year-old male participant with concurrent events of non-serious mild 
chest pain and back pain 4 days after dose 1. The event was considered related to study IP by the 
investigator and the child was treated with acetaminophen. It is stated that the participant received dose 
2 with no additional cardiac AEs reported, however there was not found a narrative for this case (OC).  
In the 50-µg group there was one 5-year-old female participant with medical history of asthma who 
reported concurrent events of non-serious, mild dyspnoea, urticaria papular, and abdominal pain upper, 2 
days after dose 2. The child was treated with fluticasone propionate, salbutamol sulfate, and 
acetaminophen. The event of dyspnoea was considered to be resolved 3 days later. The investigator 
assessed the event of dyspnoea to be not related to the IP. The participant was continuing in the study at 
the time of the data snapshot. 
Part 2 
Table 48: Summary of PTs Reported by Subjects Within the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQs (Part 2 – 
Safety Set) (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
No AEs of myocarditis or pericarditis were reported in Part 2. In Part 2, with a 3:1 randomisation rate 
(mRNA-1273:placebo), there were a total of 7 participants who reported 7 events within the 
Cardiomyopathy SMQ, both narrow and broad: 5 participants in the mRNA-1273 group and 2 participants 
in the placebo group. The 5 participants in the mRNA-1273 group reported 5 events and the 2 
participants in the placebo group reported 2 events.  
In the mRNA-1273 group there were 2 events of dyspnoea in 2 participants, 2 events of chest pain in 2 
participants, and 1 event of mental status change in one participant (Study P204 [2 to < 6 years] Table 
14.3.1.22.3.15.2.2). The two events of chest pain were both reported after dose 2. The first report of a 
nonserious mild AE of chest pain was in a 3-year-old male participant occurring 2 days after dose 2 and 
resolving within 15 to 20 minutes. No other relevant nonserious AEs were reported by the participant. 
The investigator assessed the event of chest pain to be related to the IP. The participant was continuing 
in the study at the time of the data cut. The second report was in a 4-year-old male participant who 4 
days after dose 2 experienced a nonserious moderate AE of chest pain, localised to the left side, that 
resolved within 30 minutes. The PI ordered a follow up evaluation, and the participant was seen by 
cardiologist. An ECG, highly sensitive troponin and physical examination were all within normal levels. No 
Assessment report

other relevant nonserious AEs were reported by the participant. The investigator assessed the event of 
chest pain to be related to the IP. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data cut.  
Two events of dyspnoea were reported in two participants, both after dose 1. One 4-year-old male 
participant with concurrent events of non-serious mild AE of dyspnoea, fatigue, vomiting, and loss of 
consciousness (described as brief less than 1 minute) one day after dose 1 that resolved within 1.5 hours. 
The investigator assessed the event of dyspnoea to be related to the IP. Participant did not receive dose 2 
per parents/guardian’s request. The participant was continuing in the study at the time of the data cut. 
The second report in a 3-year-old female participant with medical history of seasonal allergies, with 
concurrent events of nonserious mild AE of dyspnoea, oropharyngeal pain (sore throat NOS; started prior 
to the event of dyspnoea) and cough (cough; started prior to the event of dyspnoea), 21 days after dose 
1. The event of dyspnoea was considered to be resolved 3 days later. The investigator assessed the event 
of dyspnoea to be not related to the IP. The participant received dose 2 and was continuing in the study 
at the time of the data cut. There was one event of nonserious moderate AE of mental status changes in 
a 2-year-old female participant with relevant medical history of hypoxemic ischemic encephalopathy, 
occurring 5 days after dose 1 and resolving the same day. Participant was evaluated by a neurologist. The 
event was considered not related by the investigator. Participant received dose 2 with no additional AEs 
reported. 
Placebo group:  
In the placebo group there were 2 events within the Cardiomyopathy SMQs in 2 participants, 1 event of 
dyspnoea in 1 participant, and 1 event of palpitations in another participant.  
A 3-year-old female participant experienced concurrent nonserious mild AE of dyspnoea, bronchiolitis 
(started prior to the event of dyspnoea) and ear infection (bilateral ear infection; started during to the 
event of dyspnoea) 26 days after dose 1. The event of dyspnoea resolved 3 days later. The event was an 
MAAE and resulted in delay of dosing of the participant. The event was considered by the investigator not 
to be related to study IP. 
One event of concurrent nonserious moderate AEs of palpitations and cyanosis (cyanosis of lip) occurred 
in a 2-year-old male participant, 2 days after dose 1 and resolved the same day. The event was an MAAE, 
and the participant was treated with prednisone and cetirizine[FLD49] as a result of the event. The 
investigator considered the events to be not related to study IP.  
Additional Analysis of Myocarditis and Pericarditis (2- to < 6-year-olds) 
In this additional analysis (algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in 
the CDC working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis), there were no additional 
Preferred Terms not already captured in the Cardiomyopathy SMQ above, that were identified in the 
safety database using this algorithm.  
Summarising evaluation of the Assessment of myocarditis and pericarditis 
Following the identified safety signal of events of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with 
mRNA based Covid-19 vaccines the MAH amended the CTP to implement an enhanced surveillance on the 
events of myocarditis and pericarditis. A careful analysis based on two overlapping approaches used to 
interrogate all AEs indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis has been performed. This included: 
1. 
2. 
narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
queries (MedDRA SMQs) and  
an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 93/116 
 
 
 
 
 
AEs detected within this search included cases of chest pain, chest discomfort, angina, dyspnoea, 
syncope, palpitations, and musculoskeletal chest pain. No AEs of myocarditis or pericarditis were 
identified in Part 1 and 2 for both age groups under the MedDRA Cardiomyopathy SMQ. Overall, only 1 
participant reporting PT included in the algorithm in the part 2 of the age group 6 months to < 2 years 
old. The narrative has not been found, the MAH is required to provided it. A 1-year-old female in the 
mRNA-1273 group in Part 2 reported PT of irritability and vomiting. This participant had no relevant 
medical history and reported concurrent nonserious mild AEs of vomiting, irritability, and pyrexia, 22 days 
after dose 2. The event of vomiting was resolved the same day, and the event of irritability the next day. 
The investigator assessed the events of vomiting and irritability to be not related to mRNA-1273. The 
MAH is required to submit the narrative of this case as the information has been provided in the clinical 
overview.  
No other participant reported more than one PT indicative of myo-or pericarditis. Neither in Part 1 nor in 
Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. However, MAH is asked to provide the narrative 
for the event of chest pain in a one 4 year old participant 4 days after dose 1 in the 25-µg group. In 
addition, the careful enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. 
In summary, the submitted clinical data do not reveal any case of myo-or pericarditis up to the data 
snapshot. The sample size however is small to finally assess the safety signal of myo-and pericarditis. 
Laboratory findings 
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety were implemented in the study. 
Safety in special populations 
The incidence of unsolicited adverse events is comparable for males and females, both with regard to 
those AEs considered related to IP and to AEs irrespective of relationship. 
Similarly, for seropositive vs. seronegative trial participants, the incidences of unsolicited AEs are overall 
comparable, with the caveat that the size of the seropositive group was fairly small. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions were not evaluated in this trial. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were in total 4 participants withdrawing the study in the two age groups, 2 cases considered 
related and 2 cases considered not related to the study IP according by the investigator, summarised as 
per below:  
Group age: 6 months to < 2 years old  
No participant discontinued the study in part 1, and there were 3 participants who withdrawn the study in 
part 2, one in the vaccine group and the two others in the placebo group.  
A 1-year-old male[FLD50] experienced an unsolicited TEAE of urticaria of mild intensity (rash on torso) 
that started the same day as dose 1 leading to discontinuation from study vaccine and no treatment was 
reported for urticaria. The event has been assessed as related to the study vaccine by the investigator 
and the event of was considered to be resolved on the next day[FLD51]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 94/116 
 
 
 
 
Two other participants in the placebo group experienced TEAE of COVID-19 leading to discontinuation 
from study vaccine. A 7-month-old [FLD52]female, ten days after the 1st dose of the vaccine, on 
[FLD53]Study Day 10, experienced a mild TEAE of COVID-19 and the treatment included ibuprofen and 
paracetamol. The event of COVID-19 was considered to be resolved on [FLD54]Study Day 20. The event 
was not related to the IP according to the investigator, and the withdrawal from study on [FLD55]Study 
Day 27 was due to dose delay and relocation[FLD56]. The other case of withdrawn the study due to TEAE 
of COVID-19 started10 days after dose 1 and the event was not related to study IP according to the 
investigator.  
Group age: 2 years to < 6 years old 
No participant discontinued the study in part 1 and there was one participant in part 2. A 4-year-old-male 
in the vaccine group, on [FLD57]Study Day 1 experienced a mild AE of urticaria [FLD58] on the same day 
as dose 1 leading to discontinuation from study vaccine. Treatment for the urticaria included levocetirizine 
(1.25 mg, oral, once on Study Day 1[FLD59] and ibuprofen (150 mg, oral, once on Study Day 1[FLD60]). 
The second IP dose was withdrawn due to the urticarial and the event was considered related to study IP 
by the investigator. 
Post-marketing experience 
Post-marketing very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have occurred mainly in male young adults 
and adolescents who received Covid-19 vaccines. EMA’s safety committee (PRAC) recommended listing 
myocarditis and pericarditis as new side effects in the product information for these vaccines, together 
with a warning to raise awareness among healthcare professionals and people taking these vaccines. The 
Committee concluded that the cases primarily occurred within 14 days after vaccination, more often after 
the second dose and in younger adult men. In five cases that occurred in the EEA, people died. They were 
either of advanced age or had concomitant diseases. Available data suggest that the course of 
myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is similar to the typical course of these conditions, 
usually improving with rest or treatment. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data base and follow-up 
The study design of P204 in the younger age cohorts was similar to the design for the 6 to < 12 year of 
age cohort. For each of the 2 younger age groups, children were enrolled first to Part 1 for dose selection 
and subsequently to Part 2. Part 1 evaluated dosages of mRNA-1273 in an open-label fashion and led to 
the selection of a dosage for evaluation in the larger, blinded, placebo-controlled Part 2. As the study 
followed a pattern of age de-escalation, the older children (2 to < 6 years) were enrolled to Part 1 (to 
evaluate dose levels of 25 µg and 50 µg administered as a two-dose schedule one month apart) prior to 
younger children (6 months to < 2 years). Accordingly, a lower dose (25 µg) was evaluated in a group of 
2 to < 6-year-old children in Part 1, a dose that proved less reactogenic than 2 injections of 50 µg of 
mRNA-1273. The youngest children (6 months to < 2 years) received 25 µg of mRNA-1273 in Part 1 with 
a less reactogenicity profile compared to the 50 µg dose. The data snapshot provided for the extension of 
indication to the paediatric population from 6 months to < 6 years of age is 21 Feb 2022; data from Part 
1 and Part 2 of Study P204 are available and include at least 2 months (56 days) post-dose 2 follow-up 
from over 1000 exposed subjects per age group from Part 2 (2180 subjects 2 to < 6 years and 1138 
subjects 6 months to < 2 years).

Demography and baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced in both age cohorts between dose groups 
and between placebo and mRNA-1273 group. The majority of participants in both age groups and parts of 
the study were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. Regarding the race characteristics there were 
>75% white race participants enrolled.  
Local and systemic reactogenicity 
The data on local and solicited systemic AEs clearly documents that infants are affected by the 
vaccination. As such, 70 - 89% of children suffered from injection site pain as most common local AR 
after the second dose. The local solicited ARs for the two age cohorts were higher after dose 2 compared 
to dose 1 and more frequent in the mRNA-1273 compared to placebo group. The most common local ARs 
after any dose was injection site pain. The local ARs were mostly of grade 1 and 2 and the grade 3 events 
were mostly erythema and swelling for both group ages. No grade 4 event have been reported. 
Nevertheless, age associated aspects on erythema and swelling should has been asked to be further 
discussed. The MAH has explained that the toxicity grading for erythema (redness) and swelling 
(hardness) differ between the two age groups and a lower threshold for meeting Grade 1, 2 or 3 has been 
specified for the younger age group as described in the relevant table. It is explained that the disparities 
in the event rates between the two age groups tend to grow proportionally smaller as severity increases, 
but there were no grade 4 events reported. Another factor may be that erythema and swelling might be 
more detectable in smaller children whose soft tissue is more pliable than in older children. The difference 
of any pain in the 2 age group is explained that the youngest participants 6month to <2 year age 
category may not have the capacity to explicitly complain of pain and to demonstrate it by the 
behavioural aspect of irritability/crying. The definition of solicited systemic ARs in different between age 
group has been asked to be explained in more detail. The MAH responded that the solicited ARs were 
assessed based on 2 sets of age appropriate ARs: for the children 37 months to 5 years assessment was 
done for fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea/vomiting, and chills and for the children 24 
to 36 months were assessed for fever, irritability/crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite. There were used 
3 approaches to measure pain symptoms: self-report, behavioural indicators and physiologic indicators. 
The MAH was based on the fact that with age increase the ability of self-reporting improves, thus the 
events for ages 37 months and older has consisted of more verbally related assessment. For this age 
group, nausea has been assessed, abdominal pain has not been collected as a solicited AR in any of the 
mRNA-1273 studies.  
Solicited systemic ARs were similar after dose 1 and dose 2 and were comparable between the study 
vaccine group and the placebo group. The most common solicited systemic ARs across groups were 
irritability/crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite for the younger age group. The majority of solicited 
systemic ARs were grade 1 to grade 2 in severity, within the first 2 days after any dose and persisted for 
a median of 2.0 days. There was one grade 3 event of fever and no grade 4 event in part 1 and in part 2 
the grade 3 solicited systemic ARs of loss of appetite and irritability/crying were higher in the mRNA-1273 
group compared with the placebo group. In the older age group the most common solicited systemic AR 
in either group, occurring in >20% of participants, was fatigue. The most common grade 3 solicited 
systemic ARs, in >1% of participants in at least one dose group, in the mRNA-1273 group were fatigue 
and fever and in the placebo group was fatigue. As requested, the MAH has adequately provided 
summary tables on the Grade 3 solicited ARs: after the 1st dose, after the 2nd dose, and after any dose 
Assessment report

and unsolicited severe (Grade 3) TEAEs up to 28 days after any dose. The median duration for all events 
was less than 3 days. According to the age groups the Grade 3 ARs with the longest duration were: pain 
with a maximum duration of 13 days, after dose 2, in the 6 years to <12 year age group, and irritability 
with a max duration of 18 days in 6 month to <2 year age group. The grade 3 or higher unsolicited TEAEs 
were reported infrequently with the highest event rate in the mRNA-1273 25μg 6 month to <2 year age 
group (1.2% of participants) versus 0.7 % participants in the 2 years to <6 years age group. The tables 
regarding the unsolicited Severe TEAE are endorsed. It is observed that pyrexia /fatigue were the most 
commonly reported severe events in the age group 2 years to <6 years, while irritability and decreased 
appetite were the most commonly reported severe events in participants 6 months to <2 years of age. It 
is agreed upon that the events which were more reported are age appropriate.  
Unsolicited AEs 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality for both age cohorts was higher in the 50µg 
mRNA-1273 vaccine group compared with the 25µg dose group and also was higher in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group compared with the placebo group.  
In the age group 6 months < 2 years in part 1, unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality up to 28 days 
after any dose were reported by 53.3% of subjects and the incidence of medically attended adverse 
events (MAAEs) was 30%. The most common reported unsolicited AEs reported were: pyrexia (9.3%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (8.7%), irritability (8.0%). In part 2, unsolicited AEs irrespective of 
causality up to 28 days after any dose were comparable between the 25µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group 
compared to placebo, respectively by 49.3% and 48.2 %. The MAAES were also comparable between the 
2 groups (27.6% versus 27.3%).  
For the age cohort 2 years to < 6 years old in part 1, unsolicited AEs irrespective of causality up to 28 
days after any dose were reported from 23.2% subjects in the 25-µg group and 36.1% in the 50-µg 
group. The incidence of MAAEs was lower in the 25-µg group compared to the 50-µg group (7.2 % versus 
20.6%). The most common reported unsolicited AEs were mostly higher in the 50-µg group compared to 
the 25-µg group: upper respiratory tract infection (7.7% vs 0), pyrexia (7.7% vs 2.9%) and injection site 
erythema (4.5% vs 4.3%). In part 2 the experienced unsolicited TEAEs within 28 days after vaccination 
were in similar proportions of participants in the mRNA-1273 (40.0%) and (37.5%) in the placebo group. 
MAAEs considered related to study vaccination were higher in the mRNA-1273 group (1.0%) than in the 
placebo group (0.3%). The most common reported unsolicited AEs were comparable between the mRNA-
1273and the placebo group, with the exception of higher incidence of injection site erythema in the 
mRNA-1273 group reported by 1.3% subjects compare to 0.2% subjects and COVID-19 incidence 
reported in 3.1% subjects in the mRNA-1273 versus 5.5% participants in the placebo group. 
Unsolicited AEs considered being vaccine related 
The majority of ARs being vaccine related for the age group 6 months < 2 years are respectively for part 
1 irritability (7.3%) and decreased appetite (4.7%) and these conditions are already covered in the 
SmPC. There are no AEs considered to be vaccine related in part 1 to be considered for inclusion into 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. In part 2, for both study vaccine group and placebo most common were general 
and administration disorder and the leading symptoms were pyrexia, followed by injection site 
lymphadenopathy and they are also included in the SmPC. However, questions are submitted to the MAH 
regarding narratives and clarification regarding to some unsolicited events belonging to these age cohort. 
For the age group 2 years < 6 years, the most common unsolicited ARs being vaccine related belonged to 
the SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions were higher in the 50µg dose group 
versus 25µg dose and more in the mRNA-1273 compared to the placebo group, subsequently the 25µg

dose was the final dose chosen in the study. However, imbalances were observed regarding the 
respiratory tract infections (RTIs) including Croup Infections, Pneumonia and RSV infection for both age 
cohorts with higher frequency in the mRNA-1273 group compared to the placebo group. According to 
MAH the 3:1 randomisation scheme, low event rates, and multiple comparisons all increase the possibility 
that these imbalances occurred by chance and are not suggestive of a safety concern.  
The incidence of unsolicited adverse events is comparable for males and females, both with regard to 
those AEs considered related to IP and to AEs irrespective of relationship. In both age groups, children 
with at least one medical history have been enrolled, however no data on immunocompromised or 
“instable” children have been provided. The MAH was required to provide relevant literature reports with 
suggestive data on the role of the Covid-19 vaccine on correspondent children < 6 years old. Upon 
request the MAH has provided the literature research and the search string regarding 
immunocompromised or ‘instable’ children. There have been retained 302 articles and the overall review 
did not describe a direct impact of COVID-19 vaccines on Immunocompromised or instable children. The 
MAH states that most of the articles describe that immunocompromised child do not appear at increased 
risk of severe infection compared to the general paediatric population (Millen et al,2021) or that 
vaccination with a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine carried any additional risk other than 
those observed during clinical trials. Relevant literature was included and is acknowledged.  
Similarly, for seropositive vs. seronegative trial participants, the incidences of unsolicited AEs are overall 
comparable, with the caveat that the size of the seropositive group was fairly small. 
Serious adverse events 
As of data snapshot, for the age cohort of 6 months to 2 years the SAEs were higher in the mRNA-1273 
vaccine group. In part 1 there were 4 SAEs experienced from 2 participants and they were not related to 
the study IP. In part 2 there were 9 SAEs reported from 8 participant. Two events reported in the same 
participant (fever and febrile seizure) where considered related to the study vaccine in the assessment by 
the investigator. The other 7 SAEs assessed as not related to the study vaccine within the 28-day were 
diagnosed as following: febrile convulsion; electrolyte imbalance secondary to dehydration in the setting 
of RSV infection; metapneumovirus infection; foreign body in respiratory tract; mastoiditis in the setting 
of neutropenia and adenovirus infection; bronchiolitis; rhinovirus infection. For the age cohort 2 years to 
6 years, in part 1, there were no SAEs reported. In part 2, in the study vaccine group there were in total 
6 SAEs reported from 4 participants within 28 days of any dose and all events were considered not 
related to the study vaccine by the investigator. There were two events of interest in two participants 
reported after the data cut: one event of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the 
placebo group and one event of Kawasaki’s disease in the mRNA-1273 group. Both events occurred in 
participants who were 2 years old (at the time of screening), and the onset of the events were beyond 28 
days after receiving dose 2 (day 113 and day 79, respectively). Both events were assessed as not related 
by the Investigator. No other events of autoimmune disease, or immune thrombocytopenia were 
observed.  
Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful 
enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. Of note, the sample 
size is not sufficiently large to detect rare or very rare AEs, also the subjects enrolled were white and 
healthy individual or with stable chronic diseases and no data on immunocompromised children has been 
provided. No deaths have been reported in the study.

Evaluation of myo-and pericarditis 
To perform an enhanced surveillance on the events of myocarditis and pericarditis the CTP has been 
updated. Two overlapping approaches were used to interrogate all TEAEs. This included: 
1. 
2. 
narrow and broad cardiomyopathy standard Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
queries (MedDRA SMQs) 
an algorithm generated using MedDRA terms from Version V.23.0 implemented in the CDC 
working case definitions for acute myocarditis and acute pericarditis (Gargano et al. 2021) 
Sites were instructed to ask the caregiver the following question: “Has your child experienced any of the 
following symptoms since we last spoke? Chest pain, pressure or discomfort; Shortness of breath, fast 
breathing at rest, or any pain with breathing; Fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart.” 
Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful 
enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. In summary, the 
submitted clinical data do not reveal any case of myo-or pericarditis up to the data snapshot. The sample 
size however is small to finally assess the safety signal of myo-and pericarditis. 
Finally, the MAH is asked for data on an increase in SARS-CoV-2-positive UAI (Upper Airway Infections), 
such as laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) with Omicron, leading to hospitalisation. This has been 
described in literature recently, but is not reflected within the current data set. Upon request, the MAH 
replied that there were no differences noted in the incidence of UAIs and has acknowledged that the 
relatively few numbers of cases and generality of symptoms collected may prelude an adequate 
assessment. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required upon on cases of COVID-19 leading to 
hospitalisations or on the cases of croup associated with COVID-19. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
This type II variation aims to include children aged 6 months to <6 years of age to the label of Spikevax. 
The database for evaluation of the safety profile of mRNA-1273 in the paediatric population 6 months to 
< 6 years of age derives from study P204. It is part of an ongoing Phase 2/3, 2-part, open-label, dose-
escalation, age de-escalation and subsequent randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 in healthy 
children 6 months to less than 12 years of age. The data snapshot supporting the extension of indication 
to the paediatric population from 6 months to < 6 years of age is 21 Feb 2022. The follow up period of at 
least 2 months (56 days) post-dose 2 include over 1000 exposed subjects per age group from Part 2 
(2180 subjects 2 to < 6 years and 1138 subjects 6 months to < 2 years). However, the duration of follow 
up is relatively limited. The selection of the 25µg dose of mRNA-1273 is justified by the lower local and 
systemic reactogenicity compared to 50µg mRNA-1273. But still, also the 25 µg dose is reactogenic. This 
is reflected not only in the incidence of overall solicited and unsolicited ARs but also considering the fever 
analyses.  
There were two events of interest in two participants reported after the data cut: one event of 
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in the placebo group and one event of 
Kawasaki’s disease in the mRNA-1273 group. Both events occurred beyond 28 days after receiving dose 2 
and were assessed as not related by the Investigator. No other events of autoimmune disease, or 
immune thrombocytopenia were observed. Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a case of myo-or pericarditis 
has been reported. In addition, the careful enhanced analysis of relevant PTs does not suggest any case 
of myo-or pericarditis. Of note, the sample size is not sufficiently large to detect rare or very rare AEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 99/116 
 
 
 
 
Data on certain subgroups such immunocompromised subjects are not covered in the current dataset. 
Several clarifying questions were posed and have been addressed by the MAH. 
The majority of reported unsolicited AEs considered being related to the vaccine are already covered in 
the SmPC. After assessment of the available clinical information, so far, no AE being vaccine related is 
considered for inclusion into section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In conclusion, the clinical safety profile in children from 6 months to <6 years appears comparable to the 
clinical safety observed in older children (6 to <12 years). No new safety signals were identified during 
trial P204 until the data cut-off. However, as the safety follow-up was relatively short, especially for the 
younger cohort, an update with regard to SAEs, AESIs and MAAEs with a later cut-off than February 21, 
2022 was requested. The MAH commits to providing longer term safety analyses in the interim CSR 
planned for Q2 2023. This CSR will contain a minimum of 6 months of safety follow-up on at least 1000 
individuals in each age cohort, with all individuals surpassing Day 57. The safety profile of mRNA-1273 
available so far appears to be consistent with that observed in older children and adults, the commitment 
of the MAH to provide an interim CSR at a later date is considered acceptable.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.1 is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). COVID-19 is primarily recognised as febrile respiratory illness. While the majority of cases 
subsides without specific treatment in a subgroup of patients the disease progresses to severe disease 
characterised by oxygen requirement. Still fewer patients progress to critical disease with respiratory 
failure, ARDS, multiorgan failure and/or thromboembolic complications. Age is the major risk factor for 
severe COVID-19 and death, other described risk factors are obesity, pre-existent diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immuno-deficiency and pregnancy. COVID-19 can be considered 
confirmed by the existence of above clinical signs and proof of the presence of the virus e.g. by NAAT. In 
children above the age of 6 years of age SARS-CoV-2 infections cause mostly asymptomatic or mild 
disease. Therefore, any conclusions on incidence of COVID-19 i.e. symptomatic infection in children have 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 109/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considerable uncertainty. However, severe COVID-19 cases including cases of death do occur but and are 
mostly described in children with underlying diseases such as congenital cardiovascular disease, 
pulmonary disease, malignancy and hereditary syndromes. Currently there is an incomplete 
understanding of the burden of severe COVID-19 in the paediatric population and knowledge is evolving. 
A complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children which is distinct from COVID-19 and likely not related 
to underlying disease is the so-called “paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS, also 
referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C) which has some resemblance to 
the Kawasaki Syndrome. PIM-S is characterised by generalised inflammatory state also involving internal 
organs including the heart and kidney leading to shock and organ failure. The exact incidence is currently 
unknown. Even though intensive care treatment is necessary in a substantial fraction of patients, most 
patients survive the acute phase with appropriate treatment. The long-term sequelae are currently 
unknown. The information of post-COVID-19 syndrome (“long COVID”) in children is currently sparse. 
The MAH is seeking an extension of the indication for Spikevax to children 6 months to < 6 years. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience gained over time, there 
remains an urgent and unmet need for a vaccine able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 during the 
ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of particularly vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the 
pandemic on a population level are desired. There is one vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in children 
aged 5 years or older is available there is still a need for additional vaccines to meet demand. However, 
no vaccine is authorised for now to younger groups of 6 months to 6 years of age. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is based on one clinical trial conducted in children. Study P204 is an ongoing Phase 2/3, 
2-part, open-label, dose escalation, age de-escalation and subsequent randomised (3:1), observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled expansion study that evaluates the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy 
of Spikevax in children aged ≥6 months to < 12 years.  
With this submission interim data on the ≥6 months to < 6 years age group were provided. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the absence of a correlate of protection, neutralising Ab titres lay the basis for protection against 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or Covid-19 disease. For children aged ≥6 to <12 years, immunobridging has 
been applied previously.  
The MAH is providing results for children 6 months to < 6 years of age that demonstrate non-inferiority of 
the neutralising Ab response as well as sero-response rate as compared to young adults (18 to ≤25 
years) from study P301 in which mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy has been established. Based on these 
immunobridging results efficacy can be inferred for infants and children (6 months < 6 years). 
VE data are available to support immunobridging. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study plans remained rather vague and together with the observed deviations in the conduct of study 
are not up to the usual standard of a confirmatory trial (e.g. the timing and sample size of primary 
immunogenicity analyses, the definition of analysis sets concerning the combination/separation of parts 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 110/116 
 
 
 
 
and age groups, and the lack of pre-specification of the immunogenicity subset). It cannot be fully 
excluded that decision were made in the light of the accrued data from the open-label Part 1. 
Nonetheless, the presented analyses, observed effects and the magnitude of deviations in sample size 
render these concerns less pronounced. 
Available VE estimates are relatively imprecise, also due to limited follow-up being available at this point 
in time. 
No data are available from children with a risk of more severe disease. Unless there is a severe immune 
defect associated with an underlying disease, it is expected that the vaccine protects these individuals to 
a similar degree. 
No information is available in patients with immune suppressive therapy. A study in immunocompromised 
children is included in the PIP.  
It is currently unknown how long protection will last in children and adults, and if vaccination provides 
protection against newly emerging variants. However, it is expected that the duration of protection from 
symptomatic disease follows the trajectory observed in adults. If the results regarding the higher GM in 
children can be confirmed by the requested analyses, a longer duration of protection is also conceivable in 
this population. 
The impact on transmission is currently unknown. 
No (immune) correlate of protection has been identified to date. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Spikevax is reactogenic. Overall, for the 2 age cohort groups the incidences of the solicited ARs were 
higher after any dose in the 50-μg group compared to the 25-μg group and higher in the mRNA-1273 
dose groups compare to placebo groups. In general, in the mRNA-1273 dose groups, the incidence of 
solicited local ARs was higher after dose 2 than dose 1.  
In the age group 6 months to < 2 years the most common solicited local ARs was injection site pain, the 
local ARs were of grade 1 and 2, with 3 cases of grade 3 in part 1 (1 erythema and 2 swelling). In part 2 
the grade 3 ARs where more in the mRNA-1273 group compared to placebo group, the most common 
grade 3 solicited local ARs were erythema and swelling. In the age group of 2 years to < 6 years, the 
incidence of the solicited local ARs was dose-dependent and was higher in the 50-μg than in the 25-μg 
group after any injection (respectively 71.7% vs 58% after dose 1 and 89% vs 79.7% after dose 2). In 
both mRNA-1273 dose groups, the incidence was higher after dose 2. The majority of the solicited local 
ARs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. In part 1, injection site pain was the most common local ARs, the only 
grade 3 solicited local AR and the 2 events of grade 3 pain occurred in the 50-μg group. In part 2, the 
solicited local ARs were more common in the mRNA-1273 group than in the placebo group and were 
mostly grade 1 and 2 in severity. The most common grade 3 solicited local ARs were erythema, swelling, 
and pain. No grade 4 events were reported in both parts of the study. 
The solicited systemic ARs for the age group 6 months to < 2 years, were similar after dose 1 and dose 2 
and were comparable between the study vaccine group and the placebo group. In part 1 Irritability/crying 
was the most commonly reported event, reported by 60% of participants after each dose, followed by 
sleepiness and loss of appetite. The majority of solicited systemic ARs were grade 1 to grade 2 in 
severity. There was one grade 3 event of fever and no grade 4 event in part 1. In part 2 the grade 3 
solicited systemic ARs of loss of appetite and irritability/crying were higher in the mRNA-1273 group 
compared with the placebo group. The only grade 4 solicited systemic ARs were reported for fever and 
Assessment report  
EMA/895850/2022 
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
 
 
were similar with a frequency of 0.2% between the mRNA-1273 and placebo group. In the younger age 
group (2-years to ≤ 36-months), after any dose, the most common solicited systemic ARs in either 
group, occurring in >20% of participants, were irritability/crying, sleepiness and loss of appetite. The 
most common grade 3 solicited systemic ARs in the mRNA-1273 group after any dose in >1% of 
participants in at least one dose group were irritability/crying, and fever ≥39.0°C. In the older age group 
(37-month- to < 6-years), after any dose, the most common solicited systemic AR in either group, 
occurring in >20% of participants, was fatigue. The most common grade 3 solicited systemic ARs, 
occurring in >1% of participants in at least one dose group, in the mRNA-1273 group were fatigue and 
fever and in the placebo group was fatigue. Fever was the only grade 4 solicited systemic AR reported in 
either group. 
Regarding the unsolicited ARs in the age group of 6 months to < 2 years in part 1, unsolicited AEs 
irrespective of causality up to 28 days after any dose were reported by 53.3% of subjects and the most 
common were: pyrexia (9.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.7%), irritability (8.0%). In part 2, the 
unsolicited AEs were comparable between the 25µg mRNA-1273 vaccine group (49.3%) and placebo 
group (48.2 %). 
For the age group 2 years to < 6 years, the number of subjects reporting unsolicited AEs up to 28 Days 
after any vaccination in part 1 was higher in the 50 μg dose group (36.1%) compared to the 25 μg dose 
group (23.1%) and in part 2 was comparable between the mRNA-1273 group (40.0%) and the placebo 
group (37.5%). In part 2 the experienced unsolicited AEs within 28 days after vaccination were in 
comparable proportions of participants in the mRNA-1273 (40.0%) and (37.5%) in the placebo group, 
with the exception of higher incidence of injection site erythema in the mRNA-1273 group reported by 
1.3% subjects compare to 0.2% subjects and COVID-19 incidence reported in 3.1% subjects in the 
mRNA-1273 versus 5.5% participants in the placebo group. 
Study Part 1 (dose finding): Based on the provided data from Part 1 (in the age group from 2-<6 years), 
showing marked imbalances regarding reactogenicity and unsolicited adverse events, the decision to 
choose the 25µg dose is supported. However, exploring a further reduced dose would have been 
preferred from a safety perspective, especially for the younger age group from 6 months to 2 years. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Spikevax has been administered to a large number of adults and adolescents and the safety profile is to a 
large extent described by the data from the controlled trials. No meaningful difference could be detected 
with regard to the reactogenicity of the lower dose in the younger paediatric population 6 months to <6 
years compared to the 6 years to <12 years of age. However, the MAH is required to provide tables of 
reactogenicity comparison between these two age groups. 
Not unexpectedly, rare ADR have occurred in the post-authorisation phase. The rare ADR of myocarditis 
and pericarditis have been described mostly in young men. The cause of myo/pericarditis remains 
unknown at the present point in time. The age pattern for myo/pericarditis following vaccination indicates 
a specific vulnerability in young males. The data on myo/pericarditis in adolescents are currently still 
inconclusive so it is unknown whether the vulnerable age extends to children. However, myocarditis in 
children is an extremely rare event and the peak observed in young adults (and potentially adolescents) 
may indicate a specific vulnerable phase in life for this specific condition. Neither in Part 1 nor in Part 2 a 
case of myo-or pericarditis has been reported. In addition, the careful enhanced analysis of relevant PTs 
does not suggest any case of myo-or pericarditis. Of note, the sample size is not sufficiently large to 
detect rare or very rare AEs.

The trial enrolled only individuals who were in good health. Children with stable chronic underlying 
disease were allowed to be enrolled into the trial, but no conclusion on the safety profile in individuals 
with severe comorbidities or who are immunocompromised can be drawn.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect of vaccination is the prevention of symptomatic, severe disease that 
has been demonstrated for Spikevax in the pivotal trials that were submitted for marketing authorisation 
as well as in subsequent effectiveness studies. A similar degree of the benefit of Spikevax in children 
aged from 6 months to <6 years can be inferred by successful immunobridging. A non-inferior immune 
response with respect to neutralising antibody levels and seroresponse rates is suggested by the 
presented data. 
Whether vaccination can prevent PIM-S is currently unknown. 
The safety database overall could be sufficient. The known unfavourable effects are acceptable – even 
though Spikevax is reactogenic, the ADRs are mostly of short-term duration. The safety profile is 
comparable to what has been observed in adolescents and adults and no new ADR were observed. No 
cases of myocarditis were observed. As outlined above, myocarditis may be a phenomenon restricted to a 
certain age range only and therefore no reliable predictions can be made. Current post-marketing data in 
older age strata indicated that the cases of myocarditis are of short duration without sequelae. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even though the course of COVID-19 in infants and young children is generally milder than in the older 
population, there are individuals that suffer considerably from the direct consequences of the infection. 
The reactogenicity profile of the vaccinated paediatric population overall is considered acceptable. The 
benefits of preventing COVID-19 with potential irreversible and long-lasting consequences outweigh the 
identified risks of vaccination, especially in children at risk of severe COVID-19. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Spikevax is considered favourable. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

age based on results from the study P204 (KidCove); this is a phase 2/3, two-part, open-label, dose-
escalation, age de-escalation and randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled expansion study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in 
healthy children 6 months to less than 12 years of age. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the product information. A revised RMP version 4.1 
has been approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet, 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0481/2020 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above. 
Summary 
Please refer to Scientific Discussion ‘Spikevax-H-C-005791-II-0067’

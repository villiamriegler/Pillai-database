CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). 
ALPROLIX can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor IX levels is advised to guide the dose to 
be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. Individual patients may vary in their response to 
factor IX, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight may require 
adjustment in underweight or overweight patients. In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, 
precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor IX activity) is 
indispensable. 
When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining factor IX 
activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly affected by both the 
type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. This is of importance particularly when 
changing the laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay.  
Measurements with a one-stage clotting assay utilising a kaolin-based aPTT reagent will likely result in an 
underestimation of activity level. 
Posology  
Dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor IX deficiency, on the 
location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor IX administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to 
the current WHO standard for factor IX products. Factor IX activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative to an International Standard 
for factor IX in plasma).  
One International Unit (IU) of recombinant factor IX Fc activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor IX in 
one mL of normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment  
The calculation of the required dose of recombinant factor IX Fc is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor IX per kg body weight raises the plasma factor IX activity by 1 % of normal 
activity (IU/dL). The required dose is determined using the following formula:  
Required units = body weight (kg) × desired factor IX rise (%) (IU/dL) × {reciprocal of observed recovery 
(IU/kg per IU/dL)} 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the clinical 
effectiveness in the individual case. If a repeat dose is required to control the bleed, the prolonged half-life of 
ALPROLIX should be taken into account (see section 5.2). The time to peak activity is not expected to be 
delayed. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor IX activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dL) in the corresponding period. Table 1 can be used to guide 
dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

necessary until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy at least for another 7 days to maintain 
a factor IX activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dL). 
Table 1: Guide to ALPROLIX dosing for treatment of bleeding episodes and surgery 
1 In some patients and circumstances the dosing interval can be prolonged up to 48 hours (see section 5.2 for 
pharmacokinetic data). 
Prophylaxis  
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding, the recommended starting regimens are either: 
•  50 IU/kg once weekly, adjust dose based on individual response or 
•  100 IU/kg once every 10 days, adjust interval based on individual response. Some patients who are well-
controlled on a once every 10 days regimen might be treated on an interval of 14 days or longer. 
The highest recommended dose for prophylaxis is 100 IU/kg 
Elderly population  
There is limited experience in patients ≥65 years. 
Paediatric population 
For children below the age of 12 years, higher or more frequent doses may be required, and the 
recommended starting dose is 50-60 IU/kg every 7 days. For adolescents of 12 years of age and above, the 
dose recommendations are the same as for adults. See sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
The highest recommended dose for prophylaxis is 100 IU/kg

Method of administration  
Intravenous use.  
In case of self-administration or administration by a caregiver appropriate training is needed. 
ALPROLIX should be injected intravenously over several minutes. The rate of administration should be 
determined by the patient’s comfort level and should not exceed 10 mL/min.  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded.  
Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with ALPROLIX. If symptoms of 
hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue use of the medicinal product immediately 
and contact their physician. Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions 
including, hives, generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.  
In case of anaphylactic shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
After repeated treatment with human coagulation factor IX products, patients should be monitored for the 
development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) that should be quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) using 
appropriate biological testing.  
There have been reports in the literature showing a correlation between the occurrence of a factor IX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions. Therefore, patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for 
the presence of an inhibitor. It should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased 
risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent challenge with factor IX.  
Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the initial administrations of factor IX 
should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed under medical observation where 
proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. 
Thromboembolism  
Because of the potential risk of thrombotic complications with factor IX products, clinical surveillance for 
early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological 
testing when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-
born infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 
The benefit of treatment with ALPROLIX in these situations should be weighed against the risk of these 
complications. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with factor IX products may 
increase the cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications  
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.

Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
Excipient related considerations 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. In case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into consideration. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of ALPROLIX with other medicinal products have been reported. No interaction studies 
have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with ALPROLIX. A placental transfer study in mice 
was conducted (see section 5.3). Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience 
regarding the use of factor IX during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor IX 
should be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data available. No fertility studies have been conducted in animals with ALPROLIX. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ALPROLIX has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the infusion 
site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, 
tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed rarely and may in some 
cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). In some cases, these reactions have progressed to 
severe anaphylaxis, and they have occurred in close temporal association with development of factor IX 
inhibitors (see also 4.4). Nephrotic syndrome has been reported following attempted immune tolerance 
induction in haemophilia B patients with factor IX inhibitors and a history of allergic reaction. 
Patients with haemophilia B may develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor IX. If such inhibitors 
occur, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended 
that a specialised haemophilia centre be contacted. 
There is a potential risk of thromboembolic episodes following the administration of factor IX products, with 
a higher risk for low purity preparations. The use of low purity factor IX products has been associated with 
instances of myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, venous thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism. The use of high purity factor IX is rarely associated with thromboembolic 
complications.

1 Frequency based on occurrence in PUPs study. Both events of factor IX inhibition and hypersensitivity occurred in a 
single PUP in Study IV. See Description of selected adverse reactions. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Throughout the clinical study program, one patient (previously untreated) in Study IV developed a low titer 
factor IX inhibitor associated with hypersensitivity (see section 5.1). In post-marketing experience, factor 
IX inhibitor development and hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) have been observed. 
Paediatric population  
Frequency, type and severity of adverse reactions in children are expected to be similar as in adults. For 
extent and age characterisation of the safety database in children see section 5.1. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor IX, ATC code: B02BD04 
Mechanism of action 
Factor IX is a single chain glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 55,000 Dalton. It is a vitamin-K 
dependent coagulation factor. Factor IX is activated by factor XIa in the intrinsic coagulation pathway and 
by the factor VII/tissue factor complex in the extrinsic pathway. Activated factor IX, in combination with 
activated factor VIII, activates factor X. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin 
then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot is formed.  
Haemophilia B is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of factor IX 
and results in bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental 
or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma level of factor IX is increased thereby enabling a 
temporary correction of the factor deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendencies.  
ALPROLIX (eftrenonacog alfa) is a long-acting, fully recombinant, fusion protein comprising human 
coagulation factor IX covalently linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1, and produced by 
recombinant DNA technology.  
The Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 binds with the neonatal Fc receptor. This receptor is expressed 
throughout life as part of a naturally occurring pathway that protects immunoglobulins from lysosomal 
degradation by cycling these proteins back into circulation, resulting in their long plasma half-life. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ALPROLIX were evaluated in 2 multinational, open-label, 
pivotal studies in previously treated patients (PTPs); a phase 3 study in adults and adolescents, referred to as 
Study I and a phase 3 paediatric study, referred to as Study II (see Paediatric population). The safety and 
efficacy of ALPROLIX was also evaluated in previously untreated patients (PUPs) with severe 
haemophilia B (Study IV), see Paediatric population. 
Study I compared the efficacy of each of 2 prophylactic treatment regimens (fixed weekly interval with 
dosing of 50 IU/kg, and individualised interval with 100 IU/kg starting every 10 days) to on demand 
treatment. The study enrolled a total of 123 previously treated male patients (12 to 71 years of age) with 
severe haemophilia B (≤2% endogenous FIX activity). All patients received treatment with ALPROLIX and 
were followed for up to 77 weeks.  
Out of 123 subjects who completed Study I, 93 were enrolled in Study III (extension study) with median 
total follow-up time of 6.5 years. 
Of note, Annualised Bleeding Rates (ABR) are not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
Prophylaxis fixed weekly and individualised intervals  
Median weekly dose for subjects in the fixed weekly arm was 45.17 IU/kg (interquartile range (IQR) 38.1 -
53.7) in Study I. The corresponding median ABR in subjects evaluable for efficacy were 2.95 (IQR: 1.01-
4.35) and remained similar throughout Study III (1.85 (IQR: 0.76-4.0)). Subjects had a median of 0.38 (IQR: 
0.00-1.43) spontaneous joint bleeds in Study III. 
For subjects in the individualised interval arm, the median dosing interval was 12.53 days (IQR: 10.4-13.4) 
in Study I. The corresponding median ABR was 1.38 (IQR: 0.00-3.43) and remained similar throughout 
Study III (1.85 (IQR: 0.76-4.0)).  
Dosing intervals and factor consumption remained similar in Study III (extension study) compared to Study I 
for both prophylactic regimens.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No bleeding episodes were experienced in 42% of subjects while on individualised prophylaxis and in 23% 
of subjects while on weekly prophylaxis. There was a lower proportion of subjects in individualised interval 
prophylaxis with ≥1 target joint at baseline than in weekly prophylaxis (27.6% and 57.1%, respectively). 
Treatment of bleeding 
Of the 636 bleeding events observed during Study I, 90.4% were controlled with 1 injection and overall 
97.3% with 2 or fewer injections. The median average dose per injection to treat a bleeding episode was 
46.07 (IQR: 32.86-57.03) IU/kg. The median overall dose to treat a bleeding episode was 51.47 IU/kg (IQR: 
35.21-61.73) in the weekly prophylaxis arm, 49.62 IU/kg (IQR: 35.71-94.82) in the individualised interval 
prophylaxis arm and 46.58 IU/kg (IQR: 33. 33-59.41) in the on-demand treatment arm. 
Perioperative management (surgical prophylaxis) 
A total of 35 major surgical procedures were performed and assessed in 22 subjects (21 adults and 
adolescents, and 1 paediatric patient <12 years of age) in Study I and Study III. Of the 35 major surgeries, 
28 surgeries (80.0%) required a single pre-operative dose to maintain haemostasis during surgery. The 
median average dose per injection to maintain haemostasis during surgery was 94.7 IU/kg (range: 49 to 
152 IU/kg). The total dose on the day of surgery ranged from 49 to 341 IU/kg and the total dose in the 14-
day perioperative period ranged from 60 to 1947 IU/kg. 
The haemostatic response was rated as excellent or good in 100% of major surgeries. 
Paediatric population 
Study II enrolled a total of 30 previously treated male paediatric patients with severe haemophilia B (≤2% 
endogenous FIX activity). Patients were less than 12 years of age (15 were <6 years of age and 15 were 6 to 
<12 years of age). All patients received treatment with ALPROLIX and were followed for up to 52 weeks. 
All of the 30 patients were treated with ALPROLIX on a prophylactic dosing regimen starting with 
50-60 IU/kg every 7 days, with adjustment of dose to a maximum of 100 IU/kg and dosing interval to a 
minimum of once weekly and a maximum of twice weekly. Out of 30 patients having completed Study II, 
27 enrolled to Study III (extension study). The median time on Study II+III was 2.88 years and median 
number of exposure days was 166. 
Study IV enrolled 33 previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia B (≤2% 
endogenous FIX activity). The median age at enrolment was 0.6 years (range 0.08 to 2 years); 78.8% of 
subjects were less than 1 year old. The overall median number of weeks on ALPROLIX was 83.01 (range 
6.7 to 226.7 weeks), and the overall median number of EDs was 76 days (range 1 to 137 days).  
Prophylaxis individualised regimen  
In Study II the median average weekly dose of ALPROLIX was 59.40 IU/kg (interquartile range, 52.95 to 
64.78 IU/kg) for subjects <6 years of age and 57.78 IU/kg (interquartile range, 51.67 to 65.01 IU/kg) for 
subjects 6 to <12 years of age. The median dosing interval overall was 6.99 days (interquartile range, 6.94 to 
7.03) with no difference in the median dosing interval between age cohorts. With the exception of one 
patient whose last prescribed dose was 100 IU/kg every 5 days, the other 29 patients last prescribed doses 
were up to 70 IU/kg every 7 days. No bleeding episodes were experienced in 33% of paediatric subjects. 
Dosing intervals and factor consumption remained similar in Study III compared to Study II. 
Median annualised bleeding rates in subjects <12 years of age evaluable for efficacy were 1.97 (interquartile 
range 0.00 to 3.13) in Study II and remained similar throughout Study III (extension study). 
In PUPs (Study IV) the median average weekly dose of ALPROLIX was 57.96 IU/kg (interquartile range 
52.45 to 65.06 IU/kg) and the median average dosing interval was 7 days (interquartile range 6.95 to 
7.12 days). Dosing intervals and factor consumption remained similar in Study IV compared to Study II 
and III. For PUPs receiving prophylactic treatment, 8 (28.6 %) of the subjects experienced no bleeding 
episodes. The overall median ABR for subjects in the prophylactic treatment regimen was 1.24 (interquartile 
range 0.0 to 2.49).

Treatment of bleeding episodes 
Of the 60 bleeding events observed during Study II, 75% were controlled with 1 injection, and overall 91.7% 
of bleeding episodes were controlled with 2 or fewer injections. The median average dose per injection to 
treat a bleeding episode was 63.51 (interquartile range, 48.92 to 99.44) IU/kg. The median overall dose to 
treat a bleeding episode was 68.22 IU/kg (interquartile range, 50.89 to 126.19). 
Of the 58 bleeding events observed in PUPs receiving prophylactic treatment in Study IV, 87.9% were 
controlled with 1 injection, and overall 96.6% of bleeding episodes were controlled with 2 or fewer 
injections. The median average dose per injection to treat a bleeding episode was 71.92 IU/kg (interquartile 
range 52.45 to 100.81 IU/kg). The median overall dose to treat a bleeding episode was 78.74 IU/kg 
(interquartile range 53.57 to 104.90 IU/kg). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
All pharmacokinetic studies with ALPROLIX were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
haemophilia B. Data presented in this section were obtained by one-stage clotting assay with a silica-based 
aPTT reagent calibrated against factor IX plasma standards.  
Pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated in 22 subjects (≥19 years) receiving ALPROLIX (rFIXFc). 
Following a washout period of at least 120 hours (5 days), the subjects received a single dose of 50 IU/kg. 
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected pre-dose and then subsequently at 11 time points up to 240 hours 
(10 days) post-dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the non-compartmental analysis after 50 IU/kg dose of 
ALPROLIX are presented in Table 3.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on thrombogenicity test in rabbits (Wessler 
stasis model) and repeated dose toxicity studies (which included assessment of local toxicity, male 
reproductive organs and electrocardiographic parameters) in rats and monkeys. Studies to investigate 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, toxicity to reproduction or embryo-foetal development have not been 
conducted. In a placental transfer study, eftrenonacog alfa (rFIXFc) has been shown to cross the placenta in 
small amounts in mice.

Preparation: 
1. 
2. 
Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. Check 
the expiry date on the ALPROLIX carton. Do not use if the product has expired. 
If ALPROLIX has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ALPROLIX (A) and the syringe 
with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the 
plastic flip-top cap from the vial. 
4.  Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol 
swabs (F) provided in the pack and allow to air dry. 
Do not touch the top of the vial or allow it to touch 
anything else once wiped.  
5. 
6. 
7. 
Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the adapter 
from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. 
Place the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial 
adapter in its protective cap and place it squarely 
over the top of the vial. Press down firmly until the 
adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, with the 
adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper. 
Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by 
inserting the tip of the plunger rod into the opening 
in the syringe plunger. Turn the plunger rod firmly 
clockwise until it is securely seated in the syringe 
plunger. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. 
Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap 
from the solvent syringe by bending the perforation 
cap until it snaps off. Set the cap aside by placing it 
with the top down on a flat surface. Do not touch 
the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. 
9. 
Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and 
discard. 
10.   Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by 
inserting the tip of the syringe into the adapter 
opening. Firmly push and turn the syringe 
clockwise until it is securely connected. 
11.  Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the 
solvent into the ALPROLIX vial. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.  With the syringe still connected to the adapter and 
the plunger rod pressed down, gently swirl the vial 
until the powder is dissolved.  
Do not shake. 
13.  The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear 
clear to slightly opalescent (pearl-like) and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains 
visible particles. 
14.  Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully 
pressed down, invert the vial. Slowly pull on the 
plunger rod to draw back all the solution through 
the vial adapter into the syringe. 
Note: If you use more than one vial of ALPROLIX 
per injection, each vial should be prepared 
separately as per the previous instructions (steps 1 
to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, 
leaving the vial adapter in place. A single large luer 
lock syringe may be used to draw back the 
prepared contents of each of the individual vials. 
15.  Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently 
pulling and turning the vial counterclockwise. 
16.  Discard the vial and the adapter. 
Note: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the 
syringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. 
After preparation, ALPROLIX can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. 
After this time, the prepared ALPROLIX should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration (Intravenous Injection): 
ALPROLIX should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. 
1. 
Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of the 
tubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ALPROLIX solution 
to the end of the infusion set tubing by turning clockwise. 
2. 
If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the other 
alcohol swab provided in the pack. 
3. 
4. 
Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid has 
reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the clear plastic 
protective cover from the needle. 
Insert the infusion set needle into a vein as instructed by your doctor or nurse and remove the 
tourniquet. If preferred, you may use one of the plasters (G) provided in the pack to hold the plastic 
wings of the needle in place at the injection site. The prepared product should be injected 
intravenously over several minutes. Your doctor may change your recommended injection rate to make 
it more comfortable for you. 
5. 
After completing the injection and removing the needle, you should 
fold over the needle protector and snap it over the needle. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. 
Please safely dispose of the used needle, any unused solution, the syringe and the empty vial in an 
appropriate medical waste container as these materials may hurt others if not disposed of properly. Do 
not reuse equipment.

Instructions for preparation and administration  
1.  What ALPROLIX is and what it is used for 
ALPROLIX contains the active substance eftrenonacog alfa, recombinant coagulation factor IX, Fc fusion 
protein. Factor IX is a protein produced naturally in the body necessary for the blood to form clots and stop 
bleeding. 
ALPROLIX is a medicine used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in all age groups of patients 
with haemophilia B (inherited bleeding disorder caused by factor IX deficiency). 
ALPROLIX is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or animal-derived 
components in the manufacturing process.  
How ALPROLIX works 
In patients with haemophilia B, factor IX is missing or not working properly. This medicine is used to 
replace the missing or deficient factor IX. ALPROLIX increases factor IX level in the blood and temporarily 
corrects the bleeding tendency. The Fc fusion protein in this medicine increases the length of time that the 
medicine works. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you use ALPROLIX  
Do not use ALPROLIX 
• 
if you are allergic to eftrenonacog alfa or any other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using ALPROLIX. 
• 
• 
There is a small chance that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ALPROLIX. Signs of allergic reactions may include, generalised itching, hives, tightness 
of the chest, difficulty breathing and low blood pressure. If any of these symptoms occur, stop the 
injection immediately and contact your doctor. Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX, 
your initial administrations of ALPROLIX should be performed under medical observation where 
proper medical care for allergic reactions can be provided. 
Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being controlled with the dose you receive, as 
there can be several reasons for this. For example, the formation of antibodies (also known as 
inhibitors) to factor IX is a known complication that can occur during the treatment of haemophilia B. 
The antibodies prevent the treatment from working properly. This would be checked by your doctor. 
Do not increase the total dose of ALPROLIX to control your bleed without talking to your doctor.  
Patients with a factor IX inhibitor may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis during future treatment with 
factor IX. Therefore, if you experience allergic reactions such as those described above, you should be tested 
for the presence of an inhibitor.  
Factor IX products may increase the risk of unwanted blood clots in your body, especially if you have risk 
factors for developing blood clots. Symptoms of a possible unwanted blood clot may include: pain and/or 
tenderness along a vein, unexpected swelling of an arm or leg or sudden shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing. 
Cardiovascular events 
If you have been told you have heart disease or are at risk for heart disease, take special care when using 
factor IX and talk to your doctor. 
Catheter-related complications 
If you require a central venous access device (CVAD), risk of CVAD-related complications including local 
infections, presence of bacteria in the blood and catheter site blood clots should be considered. 
Documentation 
It is strongly recommended that every time ALPROLIX is given, the name and batch number of the product 
are recorded. 
Other medicines and ALPROLIX 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines  
ALPROLIX has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
ALPROLIX contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial that is to say essentially “sodium free”. In 
case of treatment with multiple vials, the total sodium content should be taken into consideration. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use ALPROLIX 
Treatment with ALPROLIX will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you (see section 7). Check with your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure. 
ALPROLIX is given as an injection into a vein. You or somebody else may administer it after receiving 
adequate training. Your doctor will decide the dose (in International Units or “IU”) you will receive. The 
dose will depend on your individual needs for replacement factor IX therapy and on whether it is used for 
prevention or treatment of bleeding. Talk to your doctor if you think that your bleeding is not being 
controlled with the dose you receive. 
How often you need an injection will depend on how well the medicine is working for you. Your doctor will 
perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate factor IX levels in your blood.  
Treatment of bleeding  
The dose of ALPROLIX is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor IX levels to be 
achieved. The target factor IX levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding. 
Prevention of bleeding  
If you are using ALPROLIX to prevent bleeding, your doctor will calculate the dose for you.  
The usual dose of ALPROLIX is 50 IU per kg of body weight, given once a week or 100 IU per kg of body 
weight, given once every 10 days. The dose or interval may be adjusted by your doctor. In some cases, 
especially in younger patients, shorter dosing intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Use in children and adolescents 
ALPROLIX can be used in children and adolescents of all ages. In children below the age of 12 years, higher 
doses or more frequent injections may be needed and the usual dose is 50 to 60 IU per kg of body weight, 
given once every 7 days.  
If you use more ALPROLIX than you should 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible. You should always use ALPROLIX exactly as your doctor has told you, 
check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  
If you forget to use ALPROLIX 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Take your dose as soon as you remember and 
then resume your normal dosing schedule. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.  
If you stop using ALPROLIX 
Do not stop using ALPROLIX without consulting your doctor. If you stop using ALPROLIX you may no 
longer be protected against bleeding or a current bleed may not stop. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic reaction) occur, the injection must be stopped immediately. 
You must contact your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms of allergic 
reactions: swelling of the face, rash, generalised itching, hives, tightness of the chest, difficulty breathing, 
burning and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, headache, general feeling of being unwell, nausea, 
restlessness, fast heartbeat, and low blood pressure. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For children not previously treated with factor IX medicines, inhibitors (see section 2) may form commonly 
(up to 1 in 10 patients). If this happens, the medicine may stop working properly and your child may 
experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately. 
The following side effects may occur with this medicine. 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people): headache, mouth numbness or tingling, pain in 
your side with blood in your urine (obstructive uropathy) and injections site redness. Children not previously 
treated with factor IX medicines: factor IX inhibitors, hypersensitivity. 
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people): dizziness, taste alteration, bad breath, feeling 
tired, pain at the injection site, rapid heartbeat, blood in the urine (haematuria), pain in your side (renal 
colic), low blood pressure, and decreased appetite. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this medicine.

Preparation: 
1. 
2. 
Check the name and strength of the package, to make sure it contains the correct medicine. Check 
the expiry date on the ALPROLIX carton. Do not use if the product has expired. 
If ALPROLIX has been stored in a refrigerator, allow the vial of ALPROLIX (A) and the syringe 
with solvent (B) to reach room temperature before use. Do not use external heat. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
Place the vial on a clean flat surface. Remove the 
plastic flip-top cap from the vial. 
4.  Wipe the top of the vial with one of the alcohol 
swabs (F) provided in the pack and allow to air dry. 
Do not touch the top of the vial or allow it to touch 
anything else once wiped.  
5. 
6. 
7. 
Peel back the protective paper lid from the clear plastic vial adapter (D). Do not remove the adapter 
from its protective cap. Do not touch the inside of the vial adapter package. 
Place the vial on a flat surface. Hold the vial 
adapter in its protective cap and place it squarely 
over the top of the vial. Press down firmly until the 
adapter snaps into place on top of the vial, with the 
adapter spike penetrating the vial stopper. 
Attach the plunger rod (C) to the solvent syringe by 
inserting the tip of the plunger rod into the opening 
in the syringe plunger. Turn the plunger rod firmly 
clockwise until it is securely seated in the syringe 
plunger. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. 
Break off the white, tamper-resistant, plastic cap 
from the solvent syringe by bending the perforation 
cap until it snaps off. Set the cap aside by placing it 
with the top down on a flat surface. Do not touch 
the inside of the cap or the syringe tip. 
9. 
Lift the protective cap away from the adapter and 
discard. 
10.   Connect the solvent syringe to the vial adapter by 
inserting the tip of the syringe into the adapter 
opening. Firmly push and turn the syringe 
clockwise until it is securely connected. 
11.  Slowly depress the plunger rod to inject all the 
solvent into the ALPROLIX vial. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.  With the syringe still connected to the adapter and 
the plunger rod pressed down, gently swirl the vial 
until the powder is dissolved.  
Do not shake. 
13.  The final solution must be inspected visually before administration. The solution should appear 
clear to slightly pearl-like (opalescent) and colourless. Do not use the solution if cloudy or contains 
visible particles. 
14.  Ensuring that the syringe plunger rod is still fully 
pressed down, invert the vial. Slowly pull on the 
plunger rod to draw back all the solution through 
the vial adapter into the syringe. 
Note: If you use more than one vial of ALPROLIX 
per injection, each vial should be prepared 
separately as per the previous instructions (steps 1 
to 13) and the solvent syringe should be removed, 
leaving the vial adapter in place. A single large luer 
lock syringe may be used to draw back the 
prepared contents of each of the individual vials. 
15.  Detach the syringe from the vial adapter by gently 
pulling and turning the vial counterclockwise. 
16.  Discard the vial and the adapter. 
Note: If the solution is not to be used immediately, the syringe cap should be carefully put back on the 
syringe tip. Do not touch the syringe tip or the inside of the cap. 
After preparation, ALPROLIX can be stored at room temperature for up to 6 hours before administration. 
After this time, the prepared ALPROLIX should be discarded. Protect from direct sunlight. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration (Intravenous Injection): 
ALPROLIX should be administered using the infusion set (E) provided in this pack. 
1. 
Open the infusion set package and remove the cap at the end of the 
tubing. Attach the syringe with the prepared ALPROLIX solution 
to the end of the infusion set tubing by turning clockwise. 
2. 
If needed apply a tourniquet and prepare the injection site by wiping the skin well with the other 
alcohol swab provided in the pack. 
3. 
4. 
Remove any air in the infusion set tubing by slowly depressing on the plunger rod until liquid has 
reached the infusion set needle. Do not push the solution through the needle. Remove the clear plastic

On  10  September  1999,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  to  the  EMEA  one 
application for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 
of  10  March  1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  move  the  site  and 
responsibility  for  the  final  batch  release  in  the  European  Union  from  Usiphar,  Compiègne  in 
France,  to  Hoechst  Marion  Roussel  Deutschland  GmbH,  Frankfurt  am  Main,  Germany.  
On 20 September 1999, the EMEA issued a positive notification for this Type I variation which 
required  amendments  to  Annex  II  (General  Conditions  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation)  and 
Annex IIIB (Package Leaflet) of the Commission Decision. A Commission Decision was issued 
on 08 Dec 1999. 
On 20 October 1999, due to the reporting of 16 potential cases of pancytopenia and 9 cases of 
serious skin reactions, the Marketing Authorisation Holder requested an update of the Summary 
of  Product  Characteristics  and  Package  Leaflet  through  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  (USR) 
procedure  in  accordance  with  article  1(2)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  as 
amended.  The  scope  of  the  procedure  was  to  introduce  new  information  regarding  the 
association  of  leflunomide  with  other  DMARDs,  the  monitoring  of  the  patients  being  treated 
with leflunomide and the washout procedures to be performed in case of occurrence of serious 
hematological or cutaneous reactions. The changes were introduced in the Indications, Contra-
indications,  Special  warnings  and  Precautions  for  use  and  Undesirable  effects  sections  of  the 
SPC.  The  Patient  Leaflet  was  modified  accordingly.  The  USR  procedure  was  finalised  on  
21 October 1999. The EMEA issued a Public Statement to inform the health professionals and 
the patients of this new information 
In  follow  up  to  the  USR,  on  5  November  1999,  the  MAH  submitted  a  Type  II  variation  in 
accordance  with  European  Commission  regulation  (EC)  No  542/95  of  10  March  1995,  as 
amended, to update the Summary of Product Characteristics and as a consequence the Package 
Leaflet  to  reflect  the  new  information  provisionally  introduced  through  the  USR.  The  CPMP 
adopted  a  positive  opinion  on  the  application  on  18  November  1999.  The  respective 
Commission decision was issued on 24 March 2000. 
On 28 April 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application 
for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of 10 March 
1995, as amended. The scope of this variation was to introduce a change in the manufacturing 
process of the active substance. On 30 May 2000, the EMEA issued a positive notification for 
this Type I variation, which did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision. 
On  10  May  2000,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  notified  the  EMEA  of  its  intention  to 
introduce  changes  to  aspects  of  the  Package  Leaflet  not  connected  to  the  Summary  of  the 
Product  Characteristics,  in  accordance  with  Article  10(3)  of  Council  Directive  92/27/EEC  of  
31  March  1992.  On  17  May  2000,  the  EMEA  issued  a  positive  notification.  The  European 
Commission amended the Decision on 04 July 2000.  
On 16 June 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application 
for a Type I variation in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 542/95 of 10 March 
1995, as amended. The scope of this variation was to introduce a change in the manufacturing 
process of the active substance. On 19 July 2000, the EMEA issued a positive notification for

On 20 July 2000, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application 
for  a  Type  I  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  of  
10  March  1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  change  the  name  of  the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder from Hoechst Marion Roussel Deutschland GmbH to Aventis 
Pharma  Deutschland  GmbH  (name  change  due  to  a  merger  with  Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer).  This 
change  resulted  in  two  consequential  changes  (in  the  name  of  the  manufacturer  of  the  active 
substance  and  of  the  manufacturer  of  the  medicinal  product).    In  addition  the  MAH  took  the 
opportunity to update the pharmacotherapeutic / ATC code to reflect the final WHO assignment 
and  to  amend  minor  linguistic  errors  within  the  product  literature.  On  25  August  2000,  the 
EMEA  issued  a  positive  notification  for  this  Type  I  variation  which  required  amendments  to 
Annex  I  (Summary  of  the  Product  Characteristics),  Annex  II  (General  Conditions  of  the 
Marketing  Authorisation)  and  Annex  III  (Labelling  and  Package  Leaflet)  of  the  Commission 
Decision. A Commission Decision was issued on 15 Nov 2000. 
On  28  February  2001,  due  to  the  reporting  of  296  cases  with  hepatic  reactions  including  
129 serious cases (amongst these serious cases 2 cases of liver  cirrhosis and 15 cases of liver 
failure,  9 with fatal  outcome),  the  Marketing  Authorisation Holder requested  an  update of  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet through an Urgent Safety Restriction 
(USR)  procedure  pursuant  to  article  1(2)  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  542/95  as 
amended.  The  scope  of  the  procedure  was  to  strengthen  the  information  regarding  the  liver 
monitoring of patients being treated with leflunomide, the association of leflunomide with other 
hepatotoxic medications and the washout procedures to be performed in case of occurrence of 
serious  adverse  reactions.  The  recommendations  reinforce  the  fact  that  it  is  essential  that 
monitoring  recommendations  should  be  strictly  adhered  to  and  that  Arava  should  only  be 
prescribed by specialists experienced in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The changes were 
introduced  to  the  Indications,  Posology  and  method  of  administration,  Contra-indications, 
Special warnings and Special Precautions for use and Undesirable effects sections of the SPC. 
The  Patient  Leaflet  was  modified  accordingly.  The  USR  procedure  was  finalised  on  1  March 
2001. The EMEA issued a Public Statement to inform the health professionals and the patients 
of this new information.

Authorisation  Holder  applied 
to  demonstrate  compliance  with  Commission  Directive 
1999/82/EC  and  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal 
spongiform  Encephalopathy  agents  via  medicinal  products.  On  28  March  2001  the  EMEA 
approved this variation, which did not require any amendments to the Commission Decision. 
•  On 9 March 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA one application 
for  a  Type  II  variation  in  accordance  with  Commission   Regulation   (EC)  No   542/95  of  
10   March   1995,  as  amended.  The  scope  of  this  variation  was  to  introduce  changes  in  the 
Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SPC)  and  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  in  the  following  area, 
following  the  introduction  of  an  Urgent  Safety  Restriction  on  1 March 2001  to  include  new 
special  warnings  and  special  precaution  for  use  with  regard  to  serious  liver  injuries  including 
fatal  cases;  to  include  additional  undesirable  effects  related  to  serious  liver  injuries  (hepatitis, 
jaundice/cholestasis and very rarely, severe liver injury such as hepatic failure and acute hepatic 
necrosis that may be fatal). The Commission Decision was issued 31 July 2001. 
•  On 8 August 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA (in accordance

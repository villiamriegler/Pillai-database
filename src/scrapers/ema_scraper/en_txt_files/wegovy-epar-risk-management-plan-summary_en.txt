Summary of risk management plan for Wegovy 
(semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Wegovy. The RMP details important risks of 
Wegovy, how these risks can be minimised and how more information will be obtained about Wegovy’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Wegovy’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Wegovy should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Wegovy should be read in the context of all this information including the 
assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Wegovy’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
Wegovy is authorised for weight loss and weight maintenance. It contains the active substance 
semaglutide and it is given by subcutaneous route.  
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight loss and weight maintenance in adults 
who have: 
 
 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (with obesity) or 
a BMI of 27 kg/m² and less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health problems. 
Wegovy is used together with diet and physical activity for weight management in adolescents ages 12 
years and above, who have 
 
 
obesity and  
body weight >60 kg 
Use of Wegovy should only be continued if patients lost at least 5% of their BMI after 12 weeks on the 
2.4 mg dose or maximum tolerated dose. 
BMI (body mass index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
Further information about the evaluation of Wegovy’s benefits can be found in Wegovy’s EPAR, including 
its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website under the medicine’s webpage: EPAR link. 
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Wegovy, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for 
learning more about Wegovy’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the package 
 
 
 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly 
The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and analysed 
regularly, including the PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These 
measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Wegovy are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link 
with the use of Wegovy. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is 
currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

The risk is included for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management in 
patients with T2D based on the findings in the semaglutide s.c. for T2D 
(Ozempic) clinical development programme. In STEP 2 trial, few diabetic 
retinopathy events were reported, but with higher rates and proportions with 
semaglutide 2.4 mg than with placebo. 
Patient risk factors include increasing age, long duration of diabetes, poor 
glycaemic control, prior history of diabetic retinopathy and rapid decline in 
HbA1c. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8, and PL Sections 2 and 4. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
None  
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: 
Study NN9535-4352 (Long-term effects of semaglutide on diabetic 
retinopathy in participants with T2D [FOCUS]) will also be relevant for the 
ongoing evaluation of the risk for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight 
management in patients with T2D.

development plan.

Pancreatic cancer 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Patients with T2D, as well as patients being overweight or with obesity, 
have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer. 
There is no evidence from clinical trials that GLP-1-based therapies 
increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer is

included as an important potential risk based on the EC regulation 
726/2004 Article 5(3) referral procedure in 2013 (EMEA/H/A-5(3)/1369). 
Patient risk factors for neoplasms include diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, 
obesity, physical inactivity, advanced age, smoking, alcohol abuse, 
environmental factors, history of neoplasms and family history of 
pancreatic cancer and other genetic predispositions. 
No risk minimisation measures.  
Additional pharmacovigilance activities: 
Study NN9535-4447 (Epidemiological assessment of the risk for pancreatic 
cancer associated with the use of semaglutide in patients with T2D) will 
also be relevant for the ongoing evaluation of the risk for semaglutide s.c. 
2.4 mg for weight management.

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
This potential class risk is based on findings in mice and rats for all 
currently approved long-acting GLP-1 RAs. Data from the monitoring of 
calcitonin (a marker for MTC) in plasma in the semaglutide s.c. and oral 
semaglutide clinical development programmes did not support a 
semaglutide effect on calcitonin in humans.   
Patient risk factors for MTC include previous family history or personal 
medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2), a group of 
medical disorders associated with tumours of the endocrine system.

II.C  Post-authorisation development plan  
II.C.1  Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation  
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific obligation of Wegovy. 
II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan  
NN9535-4352 (FOCUS) 
Purpose of the study: The aim of this randomised clinical trial is to establish the long-term effects of 
semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) using validated 
and standardised ophthalmic assessments. Results from the trial will be relevant also for the ongoing 
evaluation of the risk for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management in patients with T2D. 
NN9535-4447 
Purpose of the study: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether exposure to semaglutide increases the 
risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with T2D. Results from the study will also be relevant for the ongoing 
evaluation of the risk for semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg for weight management 
MTC-22341  
Purpose of the study: This active surveillance programme for MTC has been established to evaluate 
further a potential association between treatment with long-acting GLP-1 RAs and the occurrence of MTC 
in humans. The MTC registry is an FDA post-marketing requirement for long–acting GLP-1 RA products.

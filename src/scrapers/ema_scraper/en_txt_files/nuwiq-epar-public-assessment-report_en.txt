1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Octapharma AB submitted on 29 May 2013 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nuwiq, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding (also during and after surgery) in patients with 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Nuwiq is also indicated in haemophilia A patients with known allergic reactions to mouse or 
hamster protein, in which hamster cell derived rFVIII are contraindicated. 
Nuwiq is appropriate for use in adults and children of all ages, including newborns.” 
The applicant changed the application during the evaluation to “Treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). Nuwiq can be used 
for all age groups.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant 
indicated that simoctocog alfa was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, 
non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and bibliographic 
literature substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA 
Decision(s) P/0214/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-001024-PIP01-10-M01 was not yet 
completed as some measures were deferred. The PDCO discussed the completed studies on 
EMEA-C1-001024-PIP01-10-M01 and considered that these are compliant with the latest 
Agency’s Decision (P/0214/2012) of 28 September 2013. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
(EC) No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia A is an inherited sex-linked disorder of blood coagulation in which affected males do 
not produce functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in sufficient quantities to achieve 
satisfactory haemostasis. The incidence of congenital haemophilia A is approximately 1 in 10,000 
births. Disease severity is classified according to the level of FVIII activity (% of normal) as mild 
(>5% to <40%), moderate (1% to 5%) or severe (<1%). This deficiency in FVIII predisposes 
patients with haemophilia A to recurrent bleeding episodes (BEs) in joints, muscles or internal 
organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. 
Without adequate treatment, these repeated haemarthroses and haematomas lead to long-term 
sequelae with severe disability. Other less frequent, but more severe bleeding sites, are the 
central nervous system, the urinary or gastrointestinal tract, eyes and the retro-peritoneum. 
Patients with haemophilia A are at high risk of developing major and life-threatening BEs after 
surgical procedures, even after minor procedures such as tooth extraction. 
The development of cryoprecipitate and subsequently FVIII concentrates, obtained by 
fractionation of human plasma, provided replacement FVIII and greatly improved clinical 
management and life expectancy of patients with haemophilia A. Replacement therapy with 
exogenous FVIII successfully adjusts haemostasis in these patients, temporarily. Prophylaxis 
with FVIII concentrates is currently the preferred treatment regimen for patients with severe 
haemophilia A, especially in very young patients. The majority of patients receiving prophylaxis 
are treated 3-times weekly or every other day at a dose of 25–40 international units (IU)/kg (or 
15–25 IU/kg in an intermediate dose regimen), although an escalating dose regimen is also 
used. However, on-demand treatment is still the predominant replacement approach in many 
countries. 
The most serious complication in the treatment of haemophilia A is the development of 
neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII, rendering the patient resistant to replacement 
therapy and thereby increasing the risk of unmanageable BEs, particularly arthropathy, and 
disability. 
Nuwiq is a recombinant B-domain-deleted (BDD) rFVIII human FVIII concentrate that is 
produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. The rationale for 
using a human cell line for rFVIII expression was in order to more closely mimic the pattern of 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) of endogenous FVIII, resulting in elimination of 
potentially antigenic epitopes created during production in non-human cells. N-glycosylation of 
Nuwiq shows the same distribution of N-glycosylation types outside the FVIII B-domain as 
human plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII). The only type of sialic acid present is N-acetylneuraminic 
acid (Neu5Ac). The sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), reported to be antigenic in 
man, was not detected. 
Nuwiq is presented as lyophilised powder and is reconstituted with 2.5 mL of sterilised water for 
injections in a syringe in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, and 2000 IU of 
recombinant factor VIII per vial.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nuwiq is intended for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A 
(congenital factor VIII deficiency). The active substance of Nuwiq, simoctocog alfa is a B-domain 
deleted (BDD) rFVIII produced in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. 
The harvested product is concentrated and purified by a series of chromatography steps. No 
animal proteins are used in the purification process and no human albumin is used as a stabiliser 
in the manufacture of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Human-cl rhFVIII is a glycoprotein consisting of 1440 amino acids with an approximate molecular 
mass of 170 kDa, comprising the FVIII domains A1-A2 + A3-C1-C2 whereas the B-domain, 
present in the full-length plasma-derived FVIII, has been deleted and replaced by a 16 amino 
acid linker. The linker sequence was inserted in the 170 kDa single-chain molecule of Human-cl 
rhFVIII between the A2 and A3 domain. The first eight amino acids of the linker sequence 
correspond to the first eight N-terminal amino acids of the B-domain, while the remainder 
arginine-rich octapeptide was chosen to provide a recognition site for furin or furin-like proteases 
in order to ensure similar proteolytic processing as for the full-length FVIII molecule. 
Proteolytic cleavage of the Human-cl rhFVIII 170 kDa single chain results predominantly in the 
fully active light-chain/heavy-chain heterodimer. Once activated by thrombin cleavage, the 
resulting rFVIIIa has the same structure as endogenous FVIIIa. 
The characteristics of the post-translational modifications (PTMs) are in conformity with those of 
human plasma-derived FVIII. Another characteristic of Human-cl rhFVIII is the entire sulphation 
at tyrosine 1680 as found in pdFVIII. Sulphation at tyrosine 1680 is of importance for binding to 
von Willebrand factor (VWF).  
Thus, compared with the full-length FVIII, critical structural features for the coagulant function 
are retained in Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process is divided into an upstream cell cultivation process and a downstream 
purification process (Figure 1).

Flow chart of Nuwiq active substance manufacturing process 
Control of materials 
Cell banking system, characterisation and testing  
A two-tiered cell bank system was established. The manufacture of the master cell bank (MCB) 
and working cell bank (WCB) is sufficiently detailed and generally in compliance with 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D. The provided 
information on the origin, source, and history of the cell substrate is generally acceptable. 
The expression cell line 293F is derived from HEK 293F cells. The host cell line HEK 293F and all 
its generated derivatives have exclusively been cultured in serum-free expression medium, free 
of any materials of animal or human origin. 
Tests for sterility and for the presence of mycoplasmas were conducted on both the MCB and 
WCB following the recommendations as outlined in ICH Q5D. Sterility and absence of 
mycoplasmas was confirmed. Additionally, sterility and mycoplasma tests are performed 
according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) on the bulk harvest from each WCB vial 
used for production. 
Overall, the applicant, in line with ICH Q5B, has described the origin and modifications of the 
host cell system, the vectors, the rFVIII gene construct and the final gene construct in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 10/90 
 
 
 
  
  
recombinant cell line in sufficient detail. The rationale for the cloning strategy, the selection of 
vectors and the final recombinant clone to establish the cell line appear justified. 
In conclusion, productivity, viability and genetic stability, as well as the absence of adventitious 
agents and mycoplasma is in principle confirmed for all cell banks for the intended in vitro cell 
age. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Process validation covered one production campaign from revival of a frozen WCB vial to purified 
active substance and one production campaign starting with a second WCB vial.  
A major objection was raised during the evaluation regarding the validation of the manufacturing 
process, however this has been sufficiently addressed and considered resolved. 
Characterisation 
In line with ICH Q6B the applicant has performed an extensive characterisation study on 
intermediates, active substance and finished product from validation batches of the non-clinical, 
clinical and commercial process. 
Simoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein of 1440 amino 
acids. The amino acid sequence is comparable to the 90 + 80 kDa form of human plasma factor 
VIII (i.e. B-domain deleted). 
The structural analysis and physicochemical characterisation confirmed the expected properties 
for a rFVIII product. Analysis of the product indicates a fully sulphated glycoprotein with an 
oligosaccharide and sialic acid composition comparable to human pdFVIII. 
Tyrosine sulphation of human cl-rFVIII was found comparable to pdFVIII with six potential 
sulphation sites fully sulphated. It is known that these sites are important for FVIII activity and 
on the ability of FVIII to interact with VWF.  
The data provided on the biological in vitro characterisation provides the justification that Nuwiq 
is converted to the same activated FVIII as native pdFVIII. Characterisation data of biological 
activity was presented for the interaction with VWF, assessment of the co-factor activity, as well 
as for the activation and inactivation rates. 
Product- and process-related impurities have been identified and are well under control. The 
impurity profile is comparable and consistent in different batches. 
Overall, the applicant has provided sufficiently detailed data for the characterisation of the active 
substance, including structure and general properties, as well as documents indicating that the 
quality of the active substance is well controlled.

Comparability exercise for the active substance 
The manufacturing process development, starting from the non-clinical (P1) to the early clinical 
(P2a) and subsequently to late clinical and intended commercial manufacturing process (P2b), 
has been sufficiently described. Comparability of batches derived from the different processes 
has been demonstrated during the characterisation work. 
Specification 
In principle, the specifications, which have been set following regulatory requirements or based 
on batch history, are considered acceptable.  
The specifications for the active substance mainly comprise the following parameters: 
appearance, identity, pH, polypeptide chain composition, molecular size distribution, total 
protein, specific activity, N-glycan fingerprinting, bio-burden, bacterial endotoxins, potency and 
purity. The biological activity of rFVIII was characterised by an adequate set of methods. 
FVIII coagulant activity (FVIII:C) is quantified using an assay based on a chromogenic (CHR) 
substrate, which measures the FVIII cofactor effect on the amount of FXa generated in a mixture 
containing phospholipids, calcium ions, and excess amounts of FIXa and FX.  
Human-cl rhFVIII was shown to have a similar biological functionality compared to pdFVIII. 
Stability 
The primary and supportive studies were performed according to the current ICH guidelines. 
Based on the data provided the proposed shelf-life for the active substance is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The Nuwiq finished product is a white sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for 
injection. The lyophilised powder is supplied in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 
IU, and 2000 IU of rFVIII per vial. The finished product is formulated with sodium chloride, 
sucrose, calcium chloride dihydrate, arginine hydrochloride, sodium citrate dihydrate, poloxamer 
188. Before use, the lyophilised powder is reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled 
syringe containing 2.5 mL of water for injections (WFI). 
The reconstituted solution is a clear, colourless solution, practically free from visible particles, 
containing 100 IU / 200 IU / 400 IU / 800 IU FVIII:C/mL. The concentration of each of the 
excipients is the same for all strengths, only the recombinant FVIII concentration varies. All 
excipients are of Ph. Eur. quality. 
The package for the final product is a combination package containing a vial with the lyophilised 
active substance, the solvent WFI and the medical devices necessary for correct use. The devices 
include a vial adaptor, a butterfly needle and alcohol swabs. All devices are CE-certified.

Pharmaceutical Development 
The pharmaceutical development has been sufficiently described. Changes made from initial non-
clinical to early and late clinical batches and to process validation batches of commercial scale 
are explained and have been justified. The information provided on the development studies 
conducted to establish the dosage form, the formulation, manufacturing process, container 
closure system, microbiological attributes and compatibility is appropriate for the purpose 
specified in the application. 
No significant changes are made in the manufacturing process between the clinical lots and the 
lots intended for marketing. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of thawing and pooling of active substance, dilution to the 
final formulated solution, sterile filtration, filling, freeze-drying, capping, integrity test, visual 
inspection, labelling and packaging. 
A comprehensive description of the manufacturing process including appropriate in-process 
controls (IPCs) has been provided. Critical steps have been identified and are appropriately 
controlled. Process validation has been performed with eight batches of the finished product 
covering all four intended commercial strengths. In general, the provided process validation 
results demonstrated that the Nuwiq finished product can be consistently manufactured with the 
intended commercial manufacturing process. 
A batch formula with all ingredients and their amounts on a per batch basis as well as a 
reference to their quality standards is given. 
All excipients used for the formulation of the final Nuwiq finished product are in compliance with 
the current edition of the Ph. Eur. specifications, analytical procedures and their validations. 
Justification of the specifications comply with the relevant monographs of the Ph. Eur. 
Product specification 
The specifications are in line with the Ph. Eur. monograph for FVIII (rDNA). For non-compendial 
specifications the limits are based on experience from clinical and/or process validation lots, and 
the established acceptance limits can in principle be accepted. The batch analyses data 
demonstrate consistency in manufacturing and that a product of consistent quality and 
composition is obtained.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the Nuwiq finished product consists of vials Ph. Eur. type I glass 
closed with bromobutyl lyophilisation stoppers. The vials are sealed with aluminium flip off caps, 
which have no immediate contact with the finished product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 13/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The container closure system is satisfactorily described and complies with Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Medical devices that are part of the finished product are also described in appropriate detail.

Stability studies in accordance with ICH Q5C, in real time and under accelerated and excursion 
conditions, were performed.  All studied parameters remained within the specification limits 
during the stability studies. 
Photo-stability studies indicate a slight loss in FVIII potency and specific activity, when stored 
under light, requiring storage of the vials protected from light. A respective statement is included 
in the product information. 
The stability programme is considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability 
studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC). 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
The active substance of Nuwiq is produced in genetically engineered HEK 293F cells using serum-
free medium. The MCB and WBC that have been established for the expression of Nuwiq are free 
from transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE) risk substances. No material of animal origin is 
added during production of Nuwiq. 
Virus safety 
Nuwiq is expressed using genetically engineered HEK 293F cells which are of human origin. The 
fermentation process for Nuwiq is in serum-free medium. No other material of animal or human 
origin is added during production of Nuwiq. This minimises possible contamination by 
adventitious viruses. The cells used for production of Nuwiq have been screened for viruses. The 
choice of viruses and testing programme is considered sufficient. No evidence of viral 
contamination was detected in the MCB, WCB or cells at the limit of in vitro cell age used for the 
expression of Nuwiq. 
The purification process of Nuwiq includes several orthogonal steps for inactivation/removal of 
enveloped viruses. Solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment has been shown to be effective for 
inactivation of a panel of model enveloped viruses, even under robustness conditions. Further 
removal of enveloped viruses takes place during the virus retentive filtration step which has been 
also evaluated for the reduction of non-enveloped viruses such as parvoviruses. Robustness of 
the virus retentive filtration step has been demonstrated with effective removal of the model 
porcine parvovirus even under conditions of increased pressure and filtration volume. In addition, 
multiple chromatography steps are performed and are expected to further contribute to the virus 
reduction capacity of the Nuwiq manufacturing process.

In summary, the virus and TSE safety of Nuwiq has been sufficiently demonstrated. Nuwiq is 
considered safe with respect to a potential transmission of TSE and viruses. 
Finished Product – Solvent – Water for injections  
The WFI for reconstitution of freeze-dried FVIII is delivered as a pre-filled syringe consisting of a 
siliconised glass barrel, a siliconised plunger, and a closure system composed of a tip cap with a 
Luer lock and a tamper-evident seal. 
The manufacturing process, IPCs, as well as control of critical steps have been adequately 
described. Furthermore, a sufficiently detailed process validation, including a justification for the 
used bracketing approach, has been provided by the applicant. 
The WFI pre-filled syringes are manufactured and tested for compliance with the appropriate 
specifications. The methods and controls used for the manufacturing, packaging and storage of 
the WFI pre-filled syringes are in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices. 
The information provided in the dossier for the solvent is considered sufficient to conclude that 
the WFI in a syringe meets Ph. Eur. requirements for sterile WFI and is manufactured under GMP 
compliant conditions in a fully validated process. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Nuwiq is a B-domain-truncated rFVIII, manufactured in HEK 293F without the use of any human-
or animal-derived auxiliary material (except the cell line). The generation of the B-domain-
truncated rFVIII gene construct, the characterisation of the host cell line and cloning of the rFVIII 
transgene into the host cell line have been performed in compliance with ICH Q5B and Q5D. The 
cell banking strategy with a two-tiered banking system and an end-of-production cell line is in 
line with ICH Q5D. 
A major objection was raised during evaluation concerning the validation of the manufacturing 
process. This has been sufficiently addressed and is considered resolved. Data from pre-
validation and validation conformance lots have been provided and indicated that the cell culture 
process and the downstream purification process operate within pre-defined operating ranges, 
leading to an active substance of consistent quality. 
Two steps of the Nuwiq manufacturing process have been evaluated for their virus 
removal/inactivation capacity: the S/D treatment step and the retentive virus filtration step. In 
addition, multiple chromatography steps are performed, which are expected to further contribute 
to the virus reduction capacity of the Nuwiq manufacturing process. The virus and TSE safety of 
Nuwiq has been sufficiently demonstrated. Nuwiq is considered safe with respect to a potential 
transmission of TSE and viruses.  
No quality aspects impacting the benefit-risk balance were identified for Nuwiq.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
Overall, the applicant has provided sufficiently detailed data and documents indicating that the 
quality of the active substance and finished product are well controlled.  
Information about the manufacturing process, the validation of this process and the 
characterisation and quality control of the active substance is of acceptable quality. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product is described in sufficient detail and has been 
satisfactorily validated. Risk analyses to categorise critical quality attributes and process 
parameters are provided. Specification limits and analytical methods are suitable to control the 
quality of the active substance and finished product. 
The stability programme is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the 
stability studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommended further points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The biological activity of Human-cl rhFVIII was analysed in vitro. In vivo, non-clinical 
pharmacology and haemostatic properties have been evaluated in a haemophilia A dog study. 
Non-clinical pharmacology was also evaluated in Cynomolgus monkeys during a preliminary 
repeated-dose toxicity study. Toxicology studies were performed in rats and monkeys and a local 
tolerance study was performed in rabbits. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Non-clinical pharmacology of Human-cl rhFVIII was investigated in different in vitro studies and 
in animals models (Table 1).

In vitro, the investigated parameters included FVIII:C, determination of FVIII antigen, activation 
and inactivation with human α-thrombin, thrombin generation, FXa generation, inactivation by 
activated protein C (APC) and binding to VWF. 
The pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of Human-cl rhFVIII was evaluated in dogs by assessment of 
haemostatic efficacy, FVIII levels, cuticle bleeding time (CBT), activated partial thromboplastin 
time (APTT) and whole blood clotting time (WBCT). FVIII levels and APTT were also assessed as 
part of two repeat-dose toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
PK properties were also evaluated in the haemophilia A dog study and on Day 1 of a repeated-
dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro studies 
The biological activity of Human-cl rhFVIII was tested in vitro in comparison to a pdFVIII and 
currently marketed rFVIII products (two full length and one BDD rFVIII). The testing comprised 
several in vitro studies of the function of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Results obtained from non-clinical and process validation batches for the ratio of OS clotting 
assay over CHR assay for Human-cl rhFVIII were in the range of that obtained for one of the full-
length rFVIII and higher than those of the BDD rFVIII and the other full-length rFVIII. It could be 
concluded that Human-cl rhFVIII batches manufactured with the intended clinical manufacturing 
process and non-clinical batches produced upon validation of the manufacturing process exhibit 
satisfactory FVIII:C as measured by the CHR and OS assays. 
The measurement of FVIII:C/mg protein gives information about the quality of function and 
purity of the product. FVIII:C was measured by a CHR assay and protein was determined by 
amino acid analysis. The results indicated that Human-cl rhFVIII batches have a comparatively 
high specific FVIII:C, with the results being between 9,400 and 10,800 IU FVIII:C/mg protein. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 17/90 
 
 
 
  
  
FVIII antigen was determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based 
on the use of two commercial monoclonal antibodies directed against the 80 kDa protein chain. 
The results indicated that all FVIII molecules, present in Human-cl rhFVIII, have FVIII activity. 
The ratio between FVIII activity and FVIII antigen in Human-cl rhFVIII is close to one, which is 
the ideal situation, indicating that the FVIII protein is intact and fully active. 
The ability of Human-cl rhFVIII to generate thrombin at a normal rate and at physiological levels 
following triggering of coagulation was demonstrated by the Thrombogram-Thrombinoscope 
assay. It could be concluded that Human-cl rhFVIII exhibits full ability to generate sufficient and 
physiological amounts of thrombin when needed and that the generation of thrombin occurs with 
a satisfactory rate. The consistency between batches was very good and there were no 
differences between drug substances and drug products. 
The ability of Human-cl rhFVIII to participate as a cofactor in the formation of factor Xa was 
found to be similar to rFVIII and pdFVIII products. 
The inactivation pattern of Human-cl rhFVIII by APC according to the OS assay showed an 
expected interaction for a FVIII protein. 
The kinetics in binding and affinity of Human-cl rhFVIII to human VWF was analysed using 
surface plasmon resonance with Biacore instruments. The affinity of Human-cl rhFVIII for VWF 
was significantly higher than for two full-length rFVIII comparators and similar to a BDD rFVIII 
comparator. Furthermore, in comparison with other rFVIII products, a higher portion of the FVIII 
protein present in Human-cl rhFVIII was able to bind to human VWF. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in dogs 
A study was performed to evaluate the haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the canine 
model of haemophilia A using the CBT assay, and by testing the clotting function using the WBCT 
and APTT tests. FVIII:C was monitored by CHR and OS assays. Two dogs were treated with 
Human-cl rhFVIII or a marketed BDD rFVIII in a cross-over design. Both rFVIII concentrates 
were administered by intravenous (IV) injection at a dose of 125 IU FVIII:C/kg within 1 hour of 
reconstitution. Haemostatic efficacy and PD activity were found to be similar. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in Cynomolgus monkeys 
FVIII:C and APTT were also assessed as PD parameters of Human-cl rhFVIII in the course of the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies (DWL0001/063743 and DWL0002/064067). With repeated doses 
in monkeys, there were decreased levels of endogenous FVIII activity and evidence of inhibitors 
against Human-cl rhFVIII and endogenous FVIII due to the generation of FVIII neutralising 
antibodies. The antibody response was due to repeated injections of species different 
recombinant human factor VIII 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology of Human-cl rhFVIII was assessed as part of the primary PD study in 
haemophiliac dogs and a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys. Safety 
parameters included systemic adverse reactions, including cardiovascular parameters, and 
haematological and biochemical analysis. Monitoring for systemic adverse reactions through 
observation of respiratory rate, pulse and temperature was performed. Furthermore, the dogs 
were sampled for monitoring of complete blood count including platelet count and serum 
chemistry (urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin). The novel Human-cl rhFVIII was well tolerated in both dogs. No 
haematological or biochemical adverse effects were found. There were changes in the 
haemoglobin concentration, probably related to the blood sampling and CBT assay. No safety 
issues were detected with Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical PD drug-interaction studies were not performed with Human-cl rhFVIII. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties following IV injection were evaluated in a cross-over 
comparative PD and efficacy study in the haemophilia A dog model (Oct. 10, 2007, OC11-0200).  
PK properties were also assessed on Day 1 of the repeated-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys (DWL0001/063743).

Pharmacokinetics assessed on day 1 
In the haemophilia A dog model, PK parameters for Human-cl rhFVIII and a BDD rFVIII 
comparator were in the range expected for this model. In addition, PK properties of Human-cl 
rhFVIII, measured in the preliminary toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, also showed a 
typical profile expected for a human rFVIII product. The in vivo half-lives were between 5.6 and 
11 h. The in vivo recoveries were between 73% and 87%. The possible effects on endogenous 
plasma FVIII activity levels by time upon treatment with rhFVIII were also examined and 
decreased activity was seen in three out of four animals following repeated long-term injections

with rhFVIII. The decreased FVIII:C levels in two of the animals were likely due to the generation 
of FVIII:C neutralising antibodies caused by the treatment. 
No distribution study using radiolabelled compounds or alternative methods has been submitted. 
No conventional in vitro metabolism studies have been submitted. 
The elimination pattern was in line with what is expected for this type of product.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicology studies were performed in rats and monkeys. Acute toxicity was evaluated in a single-
dose study in rats. A preliminary toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys was performed as a 
preliminary dose-range finding study, followed by a 28-day main repeated-dose toxicity study. 
During the main study, a toxicokinetic assessment and a full histopathological analysis were 
performed. Cardiovascular parameters were evaluated. In the same 28-day study, 
immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the formation of anti-FVIII antibodies and FVIII:C 
neutralising antibodies. The IV administration route was chosen to simulate the conditions of 
clinical administration. A local tolerance study in rabbits was performed to evaluate local 
reactions to perivenous administration. Toxicology studies are listed in Table 3. All studies were 
performed in a good laboratory practice (GLP) compliant manner.

Single-dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity study by IV injection to CD rats  
Human-cl rhFVIII (10,000 IU FVIII:C/kg body weight [BW] IV) was administered to ten 
Crl:CD(SD)IGS BR rats (five males and five females). Clinical condition, detailed physical 
observations and body weight were evaluated. All surviving animals were sacrificed and 
examined macroscopically at the end of the observation period.  Animals were observed for 14 
days post-dose. During the observational follow-up period no deaths or in-life changes related to 
the treatment were recorded and all animals were considered to have achieved satisfactory body 
weight gain throughout the study. At necropsy one male had a pale liver and one female had 
congestion of the spleen and pale kidneys that were of not considered to be treatment related. 
Repeated-dose toxicity 
IV bolus injection to Cynomolgus monkeys 
A preliminary toxicity GLP study (DWL0001/063743) in Cynomolgus monkeys was performed to 
establish an appropriate dosage for the subsequent 28-day repeated toxicity GLP main study 
(DWL0002/064067). The treatment period was followed by a 14-day observational follow-up 
period. During the study, test parameters were monitored as follows: clinical condition, body 
weight, haematology, biochemistry, macroscopic pathology and organ weights. Analyses for 
clotting function (APTT), FVIII:C levels (chromogenic assay), anti-FVIII antibodies (ELISA assay), 
and FVIII:C inhibitors (modified Bethesda assay) were also performed. The Human-cl rhFVIII test 
substance was clinically well tolerated and no deaths or any treatment-related adverse effects 
were recorded in-life and at necropsy. Body weights and biochemistry were not affected by the 
treatment. The No Observed Adverse Effect Level was > 1500 IU/kg. Based on the results of the 
preliminary toxicity study, two dosages (a low dose of 50 IU/kg and a high dose of 500 IU/kg 
[10-fold increase over the clinical dose]) were considered acceptable for a 28-day study 
assessing the safety of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
IV administration to Cynomolgus monkey for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week recovery period  
The 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study with a 2-week recovery period was performed to assess 
the systemic toxic potential of Human-cl rhFVIII when administered by daily IV injection to 
Cynomolgus monkeys. A marketed pdFVIII comparator and the formulation vehicle (formulation 
without active substance) served as controls. FVIII:C, blood clotting times and development of 
anti-FVIII antibodies were analysed. 
Two groups of three male and three female monkeys were intravenously administered with 
Human-cl FVIII with dosages of 50 IU FVIII:C/kg/day and 500 IU FVIII:C/kg/day, respectively. 
One group of three males and three females was administered with the pdFVIII with a dosage of 
500 IU FVIII:C/kg/day. A further control group received the formulation vehicle (formulation 
buffer of Human-cl FVIII without active substance/protein) at the same frequency. A further two

males and two females were included in each of the control and the high doses groups, and 
followed for a 2-week recovery period after the 28-day treatment period. 
In-life observations included clinical monitoring, body weight, ophthalmic examination, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), haematology and biochemistry, and urinalysis. Furthermore, blood 
samples were taken for monitoring of the clotting function (APTT), FVIII:C (CHR assay), anti-
FVIII antibodies (ELISA assay) and inhibition of FVIII:C (modified Bethesda assay). 
Histopathology investigation of organs and tissues was also included into the study. 
One female animal on high dose, 500 IU FVIII:C/kg Human-cl rhFVIII, was sacrificed on Day 30 
due to internal bleeding arising from neutralisation of endogenous FVIII. Bruising and 
haemorrhage occurred at injection sites in a few other animals in the high dose Human-cl rhFVIII 
group. Body weight, ECG, ophthalmoscopy and clinical pathology were not affected by the 
treatment. 
There were no clear treatment effects on blood chemistry parameters. 
Necropsy findings in some animals, mainly in the high-dose group, such as pale liver, 
subcutaneous and muscular haemorrhage, higher spleen weight and low thymus weights, were 
considered to be possibly related to the haemorrhagic conditions. No evidence of systemic 
toxicity was recorded. The lower urinary pH and changes noted at necropsy in the thymus (low 
weight and small appearance) and liver (pallor) were not associated with any histopathological 
changes. Therefore, these changes were considered of uncertain relationship to treatment and 
not to be of any toxicological relevance. The ‘No Observed Effect Level’ was 50 IU/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were submitted. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. 
Reproduction toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies were submitted. 
Local tolerance  
Local tolerance of perivenous injections of Human-cl rhFVIII was assessed in a GLP study in 
rabbits (Study No. DWL0004/073723). A dose of 0.2 mL Human-cl rhFVIII, at a concentration of 
200 IU FVIII:C/mL, was injected over about a 10-second period alongside the left lateral ear vein 
of four rabbits with the contra-lateral vein being similarly dosed with the formulation vehicle. 
Animals were observed for 4 days and injection site reactions scored, then rabbits were sacrificed 
and histopathology examination performed on the injection sites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 22/90 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
There were in-life findings of blanching and purple discolouration and microscopic findings of 
oedema in the area of the injection sites treated with Human-cl rhFVIII that were considered to 
be a result of the administration procedure. There were no adverse reactions observed to 
perivenous injection of Human-cl rhFVIII or the formulation vehicle. There was no death, no 
effect on body weight and no clinical signs indicative of a reaction to treatment in any animal. No 
dermal irritation was observed and there were no macroscopic or microscopic abnormalities 
evident at necropsy. 
No other local tolerance studies for the intended IV route were deemed necessary because the 
other toxicology studies provided sufficient information concerning possible local effects. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity (ex vivo) 
Immunogenicity was evaluated in different studies using the non-clinical ex vivo T cell assay 
EpiScreen, which provides an effective technology for predicting T cell immunogenicity by 
quantifying T cell responses to protein therapeutics. 
The results show that the frequency of positive T cell proliferation responses recorded against the 
peptides was below the background response threshold for the assay, and therefore the FVIII 
linker sequences do not contain any significant T cell epitopes. Overall the results in this study 
correlated well with those obtained from the in silico analysis where weak major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II binding peptides corresponded to peptides that 
stimulated very weak T cell responses. 
A second EpiScreen study was carried out to assess the capacity of VWF to directly modulate T 
cell activation. The results showed that no effect on keyhole limpet haemocyanin- (KLH) -induced 
T cell proliferation was observed and the VWF did not affect cell viability. It was therefore 
concluded that the osmolarity of the bulk culture is within the acceptable range, and VWF is 
suitable for use in the EpiScreen time course T cell assay. 
In continuation of the study as described above, FVIII samples were assessed for immunogenic 
potential in order to determine the capacity to induce T cell responses in the presence and 
absence of exogenous VWF. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a panel of 50 
healthy donors were incubated with the FVIII samples (final concentration 100 IU/mL, except a 
pdFVIII tested at 25 IU/mL) and T cell response was measured using proliferation assays ([3H]-
Thymidine uptake) and IL-2 cytokine secretion (ELISpot). 
All samples induced positive proliferation responses in one or more donors in the proliferation 
assay. Treatment with FVIII product ± VWF induced similar pattern of responding donors. The 
results show that although VWF appears to generally reduce T cell proliferation against FVIII 
products, some donors still respond to one or more T cell epitopes that are presented by the 
FVIII products ± VWF. 
The addition of VWF to Human-cl rhFVIII reduced the number of observed T cell responses 
significantly. Comparison of the data obtained from the proliferation and IL-2 ELISpot assays 
showed that the samples induced similar frequencies of positive T cell responses between the 
assays. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 23/90 
 
 
  
  
Data from this study shows that addition of exogenous VWF significantly reduced responses for 
Human-cl rhFVIII tested to below the 10% threshold suggesting that complexing with VWF 
reduces immunogenicity as seen clinically. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunogenicity of Human-cl rhFVIII was assessed in the canine model of haemophilia A (Oct. 
10, 2007) and in preliminary (WL0001/063743) and repeated-dose (DWL0002/064067) toxicity 
studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
In the canine study, a single anti-human FVIII inhibitor test was positive for one of the two dogs 
in the 96 hour post BDD rFVIII comparator sample (11 days after the infusion of Human-cl 
rhFVIII).  
In the preliminary Cynomolgus monkey study, one animal in the 50 IU/kg group developed a low 
inhibitory activity against Human-cl rhFVIII by the end of the study, but not against endogenous 
FVIII, consequently FVIII:C was unaffected. In the 500 IU/kg group, both animals had an 
immune response by day 25, with titres measured on days 25, 35, 49 and 55, and a peak 
response at day 35. The endogenous FVIII activity was decreased from day 35 onwards.  
In the repeated-dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, the immunogenic reaction to high-
dose Human-cl rhFVIII (500 IU/kg/day) was comparable to that of a pdFVIII comparator after 28 
days of administration. Inhibitors were detected in the majority of animals in both groups on Day 
29 (6 of 10 animals in the Human-cl rhFVIII group and 8 of 10 animals in the pdFVIII comparator 
group). No inhibitors were detected in the low dose (50 IU/kg/day) Human-cl rhFVIII group. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human 
use” substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted 
from the guideline since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Human-
cl rhFVIII is a polypeptide and thereby exempted, consequently, an environmental risk 
assessment is not required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The programme for the non-clinical safety and efficacy testing of Human-cl rhFVIII was designed 
to assess a protein of known pharmacological action that has a comparable mode of activity to 
pdFVIII. The main focus of the pharmacological investigation was to evaluate the biological 
activity in vitro and the haemostatic efficacy (together with safety pharmacology aspects and PK 
profile) in vivo. 
The BDD rFVIII protein is a well-established substance in treatment of haemophilia A, having 
proven a comparable mode of clinical function to full-length pdFVIII. Therefore, the 
pharmacological properties were only assessed in one study using a haemophilia A dog model 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 24/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
and within two toxicology studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. The dog study showed that the 
infusion of both Human-cl rhFVIII and the comparator marketed product induced corresponding 
reductions of the CBT, increases in plasma FVIII levels and decreases in the APTT and WBCT. 
Thus, the haemostatic efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the haemophilia A dog model was 
comparable to a commercially available FVIII product. As this study only included two animals, 
no statistical evaluation is possible and no conclusions can be drawn regarding differences 
between Human-cl rhFVIII and a commercially available FVIII product. 
In the Cynomolgus monkey studies, total FVIII:C was increased immediately post-dosing of 
FVIII, particularly in the high-dose Human-cl rhFVIII groups. Reductions in APTT were also seen 
on Day 1. 
In animal models, the PK parameters of Human-cl rhFVIII and a commercially available FVIII 
product were comparable. 
No conventional in vitro metabolism studies have been conducted with Human-cl rhFVIII. Such 
studies are not considered relevant for a biotechnology-derived product because the expected 
consequence of metabolism is the normal catabolic degradation to small peptides and individual 
amino acids. Therefore classical biotransformation studies performed for small molecules are not 
warranted per current regulatory guidance (International Conference on Harmonisation, 2011 
[ICH S6 (R1)]; International Conference on Harmonisation, 1997 [ICH S6]). 
The non-clinical safety studies showed Human-cl rhFVIII to be well tolerated in rats and monkeys 
at doses up to and including 10,000 IU/kg, respectively, the highest doses tested. 
No non-clinical studies investigating genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction have been 
performed. According to ICH S6 guideline recommendations, the omission of studies on 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity is justified. Studies of 
reproductive and developmental toxicity are not considered relevant as Human-cl rhFVIII is a 
replacement protein for use in the treatment of deficiencies. 
The local tolerance study was performed in compliance with the requirements of the “Note for 
guidance on non-clinical local tolerance testing of medicinal products” (CPMP/SWP/ 2145/00 
March 2011). No local reaction to the perivenous injection of Human-cl rhFVIII or the formulation 
vehicle was observed in rabbits. 
Immunogenicity data for Human-cl rhFVIII obtained as part of toxicity study in dogs and 
Cynomolgus monkeys were comparable to marketed FVIII comparators and were consistent with 
expected findings in these animal models. 
The type and number of toxicity studies are considered sufficient to support the MAA of Nuwiq as 
recombinant blood coagulation rFVIII. All findings in the single- and repeated-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and monkeys were anticipated due to the immune response to Human-cl rhFVIII. 
No signs of non-immunogenic toxicity related to Human-cl rhFVIII administration were observed. 
According to the “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medical products for human 
use” substances like amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids are exempted 
from the guideline since they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Human-
cl rhFVIII is a polypeptide and thereby exempted, consequently, an environmental risk 
assessment is not required.

Most of the studies were used for several purposes (PD, PK and toxicology), which is principally 
agreed especially considering animal welfare. In total, one preliminary dose range finding study 
and  four  further  in  vivo  studies  were  submitted.  The  generally  limited  number  of  animals 
included did not allow extensive statistical evaluation, so only general conclusions can be drawn. 
However,  since  no  safety  signals  were  detected,  human  data  are  already  available  and  FVIII 
products are principally well known, the non-clinical programme can be considered as acceptable 
to support marketing authorisation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical studies fulfil the requirements to support marketing authorisation of Nuwiq.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Clinical pharmacology of Human-cl rhFVIII has been assessed in three multicentre, multinational 
studies GENA-01, GENA-08 and GENA-03, which provide primary PK data. Single-centre studies, 
GENA-09 and its extension study GENA-04, provide supportive data. 
GENA-01, GENA-03 and GENA-09 included a full analysis of PK parameters. Two studies (GENA-
01 and GENA-09) used a randomised cross-over design to compare the PK parameters for 
Human-cl rhFVIII with those of a licensed full-length rFVIII concentrate. GENA-01 and GENA-09 
also included a second evaluation of PK parameters for Human-cl rhFVIII after 6 months. In 
GENA-03, a paediatric study, PK parameters were determined at study start only, first for the 
previously used FVIII concentrate (pdFVIII or rFVIII) and subsequently for Human-cl rhFVIII. In 
the remaining two studies, GENA-04 and GENA-08, only in vivo recovery (IVR) data were 
collected.

Overview  of studies involving  PK investigations  for Human-cl  rhFVIII 
GENA-01 study 
Patients and methods 
This study enrolled 22 previously treated patients (PTP) between 12 and 65 years. All patients 
had undergone the baseline PK assessment, for which they were randomised to receive either 
Human-cl rhFVIII followed by a full-length rFVIII or the full-length rFVIII followed by Human-cl 
rhFVIII. In addition to the baseline PK assessment, a 3-month IVR assessment and a 6-month PK 
assessment were performed for Human-cl rhFVIII, only. 
Both infusions for the initial PK assessment and for the 6-month PK assessment of Human-cl 
rhFVIII were preceded by a wash-out phase of at least 96 hours. Blood samples for the 
determination of FVIII plasma levels were taken before infusion and at 15, 30 and 45 minutes 
and 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30 and 48 hours after the end of the infusion. For IVR analysis at 3 
months, the washout period was 72 hours and blood samples were taken before infusion and at 
15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after the end of the infusion. 
PK results 
Patients received a nominal dose of 50 IU/kg and data were analysed using both the OS and the 
CHR assay. Results are presented for all 22 patients of the PK per-protocol (PK-PP) population.

The actual doses of Human-cl rhFVIII administered for the initial PK assessment were 58.3±3.7 
IU/kg as determined by the CHR assay and 48.6±3.3 IU/kg as determined by the OS assay. 
Respective data adjusted for dose are summarised in the Table 6.

GENA-08 Study 
Patients and Methods 
This study enrolled 32 PTPs of at least 12 years of age (actual age range 18–75 years). The IVR 
of Human-cl rhFVIII was assessed at baseline (visit 1) and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. 
The mean total Haemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) in this patient population at study start 
was 34.6 and the median score was 20.5. 
IVR was calculated from the FVIII plasma level pre-infusion and the peak level obtained in the 
15, 30, 45 or 60 minutes post-infusion samples. The wash-out periods as required per protocol 
were at least 72 hours for the baseline investigation and at least 48 hours for the investigations 
at 3 and 6 months. 
IVR Results Over Time 
The actual doses of Human-cl rhFVIII administered for IVR assessment according to the CHR 
assay as measured by the central laboratory, at visit 1, 3 months and 6 months were 55.6±2.8 
IU/kg, 53.5±4.6 IU/kg and 53.6±2.3 IU/kg, respectively. The corresponding actual doses 
according to the OS assay were 47.8±2.8 IU/kg, 45.1±4.2 IU/kg and 45.3±2.5 IU/kg.  
For both assays, the FVIII:C profiles were highly similar for all three assessments, and there 
were no marked differences in either peak concentrations or the rate of decrease in FVIII 
concentration between 15 and 60 minutes across assessments; however, both mean and median 
IVRs were slightly lower at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline. Both FVIII:C and IVR values 
based on the OS assay were lower than those obtained with the CHR assay. An analysis of the 
geometric means of the ratios of individual IVRs was provided, in addition, which was within the 
accepted bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%.

Special populations - GENA-03 study (paediatric study) 
Patients and methods 
This study enrolled 59 PTPs (29 aged 2–5 years and 30 aged 6–12 years). Twenty-seven (26 
evaluable) patients participated in the PK phase of the study in which they received their 
previous FVIII concentrate (pdFVIII or full-length rFVIII) followed by Human-cl rhFVIII. An 
additional 32 patients did not participate in the PK phase, but had an initial IVR assessment. IVR 
assessments were also performed after 3 and 6 months of treatment in all patients. 
Blood samples for the determination of FVIII plasma levels were taken before infusion and 30 
minutes and 2, 5, 10, 24 and 48 hours after the end of the infusion. 
This study enrolled 59 patients (29 aged 2–5 years and 30 aged 6–12 years). Twenty-seven (26

additional 32 patients did not participate in the PK phase, but had an initial IVR assessment. IVR 
assessments were also performed after 3 and 6 months of treatment in all patients. 
Both infusions for the initial PK assessment were preceded by a wash-out phase of at least 72 
hours. Blood samples for the determination of FVIII plasma levels were taken before infusion and 
30 minutes and 2, 5, 10, 24 and 48 hours after the end of the infusion. 
The IVR of Human-cl rhFVIII was calculated after a wash-out period of at least 72 hours from the 
FVIII plasma level pre-infusion and the peak level obtained in the 30 minutes or 2 hours post-
infusion samples. 
PK results 
Results are presented for all 26 patients of the PK-PP population; separate analyses for patients 
between 2 and 5 years (N=13) and between 6 and 12 years (N=13) are also included. The actual 
doses of Human-cl rhFVIII administered were 53.1±1.5 IU/kg as determined by the CHR assay 
and 45.4±1.1 IU/kg as determined by the OS assay. PK results are shown below in Tables 7 and

Supportive studies - GENA-09 and GENA-04 
Patients and Methods 
GENA-09 enrolled 22 PTPs between 18 and 62 years at a single centre in Russia. This patient 
population differs from other adult populations in Human-cl rhFVIII studies in that these patients 
had been inadequately treated in the past, as evidenced by the high total HJHS at study start 
(mean 45.3, median 45.0). Patients were randomised to receive either Human-cl rhFVIII followed 
by a full length rFVIII or the full-length rFVIII followed by Human-cl rhFVIII for the initial PK 
assessment. Patients subsequently received prophylaxis treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII, every 
other day, for 6 months. After 3 months, IVR of Human-cl rhFVIII was determined. A second PK 
assessment (Human-cl rhFVIII only) was performed after 6 months. 
GENA-04 was the extension study GENA-09. Of the 22 patients enrolled in the parent study, 18 
enrolled in the extension study. IVR was assessed at 3 months and subsequently every 3 months 
until study completion. The study was originally planned to continue until Human-cl rhFVIII was 
registered and launched in Russia. 
PK-results 
PK parameters were broadly comparable between the two products. When compared with the 
results of GENA-01 (adult population), the PK results of GENA-09 represent increased “FVIII-
turnover” with higher clearance (CL) and lower area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax), IVR and T1/2. However, data reflect a single-centre study, which has been 
conducted in a region with presumably reduced health care not comparable with Western 
European countries and has been conducted with a differing population of highly impaired health 
status. 
Mean and median IVRs were comparable for both assays at study start (GENA-09); at 3 and 6 
months, values obtained with the OS assay were lower than those obtained with the CHR assay. 
Nevertheless, the results confirm no marked changes in IVR of Human-cl rhFVIII over time. 
For GENA-04 results of IVR over time were stable. 
Special populations: Increased body weight 
Body mass index (BMI) has been identified to affect PK-results and consecutively posology. BMI-
dependent PK-results for adults are presented in Table 9.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacodynamic studies are not applicable as per the Guideline, nor do they seem 
meaningful since pharmacologic properties known or thought to be related to the desired clinical 
effects (biomarkers) and other properties not related to the desired clinical effect of FVIII are not 
applicable. 
Absorption studies are not applicable as per the IV route of administration; distribution, 
elimination and metabolism studies are not required in accordance with the guideline for the type 
of product. 
Pivotal PK-study GENA-01 in adolescents and adults was provided. In general, the study follows 
the currently valid Clinical Guideline with regard to study design and patient numbers: Overall, 
22 patients between 12 and 65 years of age were included. Numbers, dosage, PK parameters 
and sampling points were chosen according to the guideline. PK parameters were provided in 
comparison with a full-length rFVIII and determined by OS and CHR assays. Re-test PK for 
Human-cl rhFVIII was done after 6 months interval. The PK profile of Human-cl rhFVIII at 6 
months was generally comparable to study start, with the exception of results of outliers from 
the Bulgarian center. 
Overall repeat-PK data are considered to support efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII. Furthermore, IVR-
results over time were provided from study GENA-08 covering 32 PTPs 18-75 years of age. 
Overall in GENA-01, CHR assay PK parameters for Human-cl rhFVIII at a dose of 50 IU/kg in 
adult PTPs (age 18–65 years) with severe haemophilia A (N=20) were; AUC (hr*IU/mL) 22.6 ± 
8.0 [22.3 (8.4–38.1)], T1/2 (hr) 14.7 ± 10.4 [12.5 (5.4–55.6)] IVR (%/IU/kg) 2.5 ± 0.4 [2.5 
(1.7–3.2)]; and CL (mL/hr/kg) 3.0 ± 1.2 [2.7 (1.5-6.4)]. 
PK parameters are also presented in the SmPC as an analysis with respect to BMI; as per normal 
weight: BMI 18.5–25 kg/m2, pre-adipose: BMI 25–30 kg/m2, adipose: BMI >30 kg/m2. Body 
mass index (BMI) has been identified to affect PK-results and consecutively posology. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 33/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
BMI-dependent evaluation of PK parameters from studies GENA-01 and GENA-03 was performed. 
BMI-dependent trends (increasing AUC, T½, IVR and decreasing CL follow the assumption of 
FVIII being active in the intravascular space, mainly. As illustrated, BMI significantly changes PK 
parameters in haemophilia patients. It is agreed, that the low number of evaluated data-sets 
does not allow representative conclusions. For overweight patients (documented mainly for the 
adult population), over-dosing has to be assumed when dosage is based simply upon body 
weight as addressed in the SmPC. Moreover, a significant part of the paediatric population might 
be under-dosed with potential “artificially” reduced T½ and increased dosing frequency. 
Consequently, the issue was reflected in the SmPC with respect to posology (dose and frequency 
of administration - Section 4.2). 
Three subjects (ages 12, 12 and 14 years) have been included from the adolescent age-group. 
Paediatric population 
PK data from a paediatric study (GENA-03) was provided. In general, the study follows the 
currently valid Clinical Guideline with regard to patient numbers (overall 26 PP-PK patients, 13 in 
each age-group), dosage, PK parameters and sampling points. The latter slightly deviate from 
the 4 sampling points of the guideline (baseline, 1 hour, 10 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after 
infusion) and reflect baseline, 30 minutes and 2, 5, 10, 24 and 48 hours after the end of the 
infusion. Due to the known PK acceleration in paediatric age-groups the chosen adaptation is 
acknowledged. 
PK parameters were provided in comparison with previously used FVIII product. No relevant 
discrepancies were detected. Mean FVIII:C profiles over time, after standardising for actual dose 
for both products and according to both assays, were provided. Overall, all curves followed a 
similar pattern. 
As known from the literature, IVR and T1/2 is lower in young children than in adults and CL is 
higher, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma volume per kilogram body weight 
in younger patients. 
Comparison of PK results between both age-subgroups, a tendency to reduced AUC, Cmax and 
T1/2, together with increased CL, has been documented with decreasing age. This phenomenon is 
well known for similar factor substitutes. Results of IVR over time were stable. 
Other special populations 
In addition, data from a further study (GENA-09) were provided. This single-centre study 
comprised 22 patients and was conducted in a region of presumably reduced health care not 
comparable with Western European countries. Results of that study are therefore only considered 
to be supportive. 
When compared with the results of GENA-01 (adult population), the PK results of GENA-09 
represent increased “FVIII-turnover” with higher CL and lower AUC, Cmax, IVR and T1/2. This 
might be attributable to the impaired overall health status, e.g. highly relevant target joints in 
the GENA-09 study population.

GENA-04 was an extension study of GENA-09 providing stable IVR-results over time. 
Study design and results of the provided pivotal PK studies in adults and paediatric patients as 
well as supportive data from a special population are considered to adequately confirm an 
acceptable PK profile of Human-cl rhFVIII, in general.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology aspects of Human-cl rhFVIII are adequately addressed and fulfil the 
requirements to support marketing authorisation of Nuwiq. The results including BMI-dependent 
PK results have been reflected within the SmPC.

Treatments 
Human-cl rhFVIII was administered for treatment of BEs or in case of surgical procedures as an 
IV bolus injection at a maximum speed of 4 mL/minute. The required dosage was determined 
using the following formula: 
Required units = BW (kg) * desired FVIII rise (%) (IU/dL) * 0.5 (assuming that the IVR of FVIII 
is 2%/[IU/kg]) 
The required target peak levels were approximately 40–60% in case of minor haemorrhage; 60–
80% in case of moderate to major haemorrhage; 100–120% in case of major to life threatening 
BEs. 
 Recommended definitions and dosages for haemorrhages are given in Table 10.

Dose = target increase of FVIII (IU/dL) * BW/actual IVR (IU/dL)/(IU/kg). 
Additionally the following dosages were recommended: 
Minor surgeries including tooth extractions: 25–30 IU FVIII/kg within 3 hours prior to surgery to 
achieve an intended target peak level of about 50–60%, repeated every 12−24 hours until 
healing was complete. Trough level was to be maintained at approximately 30% (samples taken 
prior to the next infusion of the investigational medicinal product (IMP)). 
Major surgeries: 50 IU FVIII/kg within 3 hours prior to surgery to achieve an intended target 
peak level of approximately 100%, repeated if necessary after 6–12 hours initially and 
subsequently for at least 6 days until healing was complete. Trough levels were to be maintained 
at approximately 50% (samples taken prior to the next infusion of the IMP). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this clinical study was to determine the PK profile of Human-cl rhFVIII in 
terms of FVIII:C and to compare it with a licensed rFVIII concentrate in PTPs with severe 
haemophilia A. 
Secondary objectives of this study were to: 
• Calculate the incremental IVR of FVIII:C for Human-cl rhFVIII. 
• Investigate the immunogenic potential of Human-cl rhFVIII.

• Assess clinical efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in the treatment of BEs. 
• Assess clinical efficacy and safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in surgical prophylaxis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
After each infusion of IMP and at the end of a BE, the following efficacy assessment was made by 
the patient (together with the investigator in case of on-site treatment): 
• Excellent: Abrupt pain relief and/or unequivocal improvement in objective signs of a BE within 
approximately 8 hours after a single infusion. 
• Good: Definite pain relief and/or improvement in signs of a BE within approximately 8 to 12 
hours after an infusion requiring up to 2 infusions for complete resolution. 
• Moderate: Probable or slight beneficial effect within approximately 12 hours after the first 
infusion requiring more than two infusions for complete resolution. 
• None: No improvement within 12 hours, or worsening of symptoms, requiring more than 2 
infusions for complete resolution. 
•  Sample size 
It was planned to include a total of 20 patients in the study. After a further protocol amendment 
the following was added: Assuming independent binomially distributed success within subjects 
and centres, the expected ~1000 bleeding episodes in this study can serve to show that the rate 
of successful treatments (haemostatic efficacy rated good or excellent) is above 70 % (α=0.025, 
one sided) if the true success rate is 75% or better with a power of 94%. For the secondary 
hypothesis, 1000 bleedings can serve to show that the rate of successful treatments is above 80 
% (α=0.025, one sided) if the true success rate is 85% or better with a power of 98.6%.

•  Statistical methods 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was compiled where the statistical analysis of the primary, 
secondary and safety endpoints was to be understood in the exploratory sense. No confirmatory 
hypothesis testing was planned. 
The BLEED population (all BEs documented in the intention-to-treat [ITT] population which 
received any amount of Human-cl rhFVIII) was used to assess the efficacy in the treatment of 
BEs; The SURG population (documented surgical procedure in the ITT population which used 
Human-cl rhFVIII) was used to assess the efficacy of surgical prophylaxis.

•  Conduct of the study 
The protocol version at the time of study start (v. 7, dated 16-Mar-2010) included amendments 
1 to 3, during the study 3 further amendments were made. All 22 patients had a least one minor 
protocol deviation. Four patients used other FVIII after the start of the on-demand phase (major 
protocol deviations). Most minor protocol deviations were due to not respecting the 72-hour 
wash-out period, which occurred in 17 patients overall (77.3%). 
•  Baseline data 
Main historical BE sites were the ankle (54.5% of patients both sides, 9.1% each for left and 
right ankle), the knee (45.5% of patients both sides, 9.1% and 22.7% left and right knee, 
respectively) and the elbow (40.9% of patients both sides, 13.6% and 27.3% left and right 
elbow, respectively). 
Full information on the total number of EDs for previous FVIII concentrates per patient was 
available for 11 of 22 patients. Four of these received pdFVIII concentrates with a mean of 26.0 
EDs and 7 received rFVIII concentrates with a mean of 17.9 EDs within 6 months before the 
study start. 
Six patients were HIV-positive, all with CD4+ T cell counts higher than 200/μL and the HIV viral 
load as measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) well below 400,000 copies/mL. 
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of patients in GENA-01 are shown in Table 11.

•  Numbers analysed 
Efficacy results for Human-cl rhFVIII were based on the ITT dataset (N=22). Efficacy of Human-
cl rhFVIII was assessed in BEs for which any amount of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII was 
documented and which were experienced by patients from the ITT population between the start 
of home treatment after PK Cycle 2 and the completion visit (BLEED population, N=986 BEs).  
Efficacy during surgery was analysed for surgical procedures of patients from the ITT population 
for which any amount of Human-cl rhFVIII prior to, during or after the surgery was documented 
and no other FVIII concentrate was documented within 24 hours prior to the surgery (SURG 
population, N=2 surgeries). All subjects in the ITT analysis population who completed the trial 
without violating the inclusion/exclusion criteria or other aspects of the protocol considered to 
potentially affect the efficacy results were included in the PP population (N=14).

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Bleeding episodes 
In total there were 997 BEs that started after start of home treatment after PK Cycle 2. Thereof, 
986 BEs were documented BEs in patients in the ITT population for which any amount of 
treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII was documented and which started between initiation of home 
treatment after PK cycle 2 (i.e., one day after drawing of last blood sample for PK) and the 
completion visit. 
Of the 986 BEs, 642 (65.1%) were spontaneous, 341 (34.6%) were traumatic, and 3 (0.3%) 
were due to other causes. In total, 416 (42.2%) were minor, 566 (57.4%) were moderate to 
major and 3 (0.3%) were major to life-threatening. These 3 BEs are described in more detail 
below. The severity for one BE was unknown. 
The number of BEs treated with Human-cl rhFVIII per patient ranged from 15 to 93. The most 
common sites of bleeding were the knee (230 BEs 23.3%), the elbow (225 BEs, 22.8%), other 
sites (166 BEs, 16.8%) and the ankle (155 BEs, 15.7%). 
Two of the 3 major to life-threatening BEs were traumatic bleeds in one patient; the first BE was 
treated with 3 infusions on 2 EDs with a total of 7000 IU (104.5 IU/kg) of Human-cl rhFVIII with 
moderate efficacy; the second BE was treated with 2 infusions over 2 EDs with 5500 IU (82.1 
IU/kg) of Human-cl rhFVIII with good efficacy. The third major to life-threatening BE was a 
spontaneous right and left groin bleed in patient 010101 which required only 1 infusion of 
Human-cl rhFVIII (4000 IU; 45.5 IU/kg) to treat and the efficacy of that treatment was judged 
as good. 
A summary of the EDs and dosages with Human-cl rhFVIII for the treatment of BEs is shown in 
Table 12. 
Assessment report

Table 12: 
EDs  and  Human-cl  rhFVIII  dosages  for  treatment  of  BEs  (BLEED 
population, N=986) 
The mean duration of treatment of BEs overall was 1.1±0.75 days (range 1-19 days). Minor BEs 
required a mean of 1.0±0.17 days of treatment, moderate to major BEs 1.2±0.96 days and 
major to life-threatening 1.7±0.58 days. The one BE that was of unknown severity (spontaneous 
bleed in the right forearm in patient 010501) required 2 days of treatment. 
Personal efficacy assessments were used for analysis and were available for 985 BEs and missing 
for 1. Overall, 94.4% (931/986) of the BEs were treated with excellent or good efficacy (60.3% 
excellent, 34.1% good). Treatment efficacy was judged as moderate in 5.5% of BEs. In no BE 
was Human-cl rhFVIII treatment judged as having no efficacy. 
Efficacy assessment of each individual infusion revealed similar results. Overall, 90.4% 
(941/1041 infusions of BLEED population) infusions were judged as having excellent or good 
efficacy (48.2% excellent, 42.2% good). Treatment efficacy was judged as moderate in 88 
(8.5%) infusions and as none in 9 (0.9%) of infusions. Efficacy assessment was missing for 3 
infusions. 
Regarding the 9 infusions that were judged as having no efficacy, they were all administered for 
moderate to major BEs. Six of these infusions were given to the same patient for 2 BEs due to a 
trauma, 5 were received for one BE (all at the dose of 34.88 IU/kg), for a total Human-cl rhFVIII 
dose of 15,000 IU (174.4 IU/kg). Three infusions were rated as having no efficacy and 2 as 
having moderate efficacy. The overall assessment of Human-cl rhFVIII efficacy for this BE was 
moderate. For the second BE the patient received 3 infusions at the dose of 34.88 IU/kg, for a 
total Human-cl rhFVIII dose of 9,000 IU (104.7 IU/kg); the overall assessment of Human-cl 
rhFVIII efficacy for this BE was assessed as good. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014

The other 3 infusions that were judged as having no efficacy were administered for a single BE; 4 
infusions of Human-cl rhFVIII over 3 EDs (40.0 IU/kg for all) were administered for a total dose 
of 11,500 IU (153.3 IU/kg). Efficacy of 3 infusions for this BE was judged as none and for one 
infusion as moderate, and the overall efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII for this BE was moderate. 
Surgery 
During the study, 2 patients underwent 2 surgical procedures, one major (revision of right total 
knee – 15 infusions) and one minor (colonoscopy / oesophagogastrodudenoscopy – 5 infusions). 
The duration of the minor surgery was 51 minutes and of the major surgery 150 minutes. 
Efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII during surgeries was assessed intra-operatively by the surgeon and 
overall by the surgeon and haematologist. Both intra-operative and overall efficacy was rated as 
excellent for both surgeries.

Study GENA-08 
Methods 
•  Study participants  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were as described for GENA-01. 
•  Treatments 
Patients being treated prophylactically were to receive 30–40 IU FVIII/kg every other day until 6 
months and at least 50 EDs had been reached. Two dose escalations of +5 IU/kg each were 
allowed in case of an inadequate response (≥2 spontaneous BEs during one month). On-demand 
treatment and surgical prophylaxis followed the same methodology as described for GENA-01. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of this clinical study was to determine the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII 
during prophylactic treatment, in the treatment of BEs and in surgical prophylaxis in PTPs with 
severe haemophilia A. Secondary objectives of this study were as described for GENA-01.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in prophylaxis, in treatment of BEs 
and in surgical procedures. 
For prophylactic treatment, primary efficacy variables were the overall efficacy assessment after 
a total of at least 50 EDs at the end of the study and consumption of IMP (FVIII IU/kg per 
month, per year) per patient and in total. 
The frequency of spontaneous breakthrough BEs/month under prophylactic treatment was 
assessed as excellent, good, moderate or poor: 
−  Excellent: Less than 0.75 spontaneous BEs per month 
−  Good: Between 0.75 and 1 spontaneous BEs per month 
−  Moderate: Between 1 and 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
−  Poor: More than 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month 
In addition to the primary analysis of spontaneous BEs, an additional assessment of the monthly 
BE rate for all types of BE was performed.  
For on-demand treatment of BEs, the primary efficacy variable was the efficacy assessment at 
the end of the BE. Efficacy ratings were the same as described for GENA-01 (excellent, good, 
moderate and none). 
For surgical procedures, primary efficacy variables were the overall efficacy assessment after the 
end of the surgical prophylactic treatment phase and average and maximum expected estimated 
blood loss compared to the actual estimated blood loss. Efficacy was assessed at the end of 
surgery by the surgeon and postoperatively by the surgeon and the haematologist using an 
objective scale taking into account intra- and post-operative assessments. 
An overall efficacy assessment taking both the intra- and post-operative assessment into account 
was done by the surgeon and haematologist. 
•  Sample size 
It was planned to include a total of 32 evaluable patients into the study. No inferential analysis 
involving formal testing was planned and consequently no formal sample size estimation was 
performed. 
•  Randomisation 
This was not applicable as this was a single-arm study. 
Assessment report

•  Blinding (masking) 
This was not applicable as this was an open-label study. 
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical study conduct 
A SAP was compiled as a separate document. No inferential statistics were planned for this 
uncontrolled efficacy trial; planned statistics were exploratory and descriptive. The subject 
disposition, i.e. the identification of significant deviations to consider for the PP population and 
the assignment of each subject to these analysis populations, was to be the joint decision of the 
trial statistician and the responsible medical expert in a data review meeting prior to database 
lock. The final statistical analysis was to be conducted upon completion of all database release 
procedures (DBR) and sign-off of the DBR release form. 
Three populations were considered: 
Safety analysis population: All subjects who received at least one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII; 
Intent to Treat (ITT) analysis population: All subjects in the safety analysis population for whom 
any data was collected post treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII 
Per Protocol (PP) analysis population: All subjects in the ITT analysis population who completed 
the trial without significantly violating the inclusion/exclusion criteria or other aspects of the 
protocol considered to potentially affect the efficacy results.  
In addition to the basic populations the following subpopulations were defined (similar definitions 
were also made based on the PP population): 
Population of subjects on prophylactic treatment schedule (PROPH): All subjects in the ITT 
population who had at least one prophylactic treatment. The PROPH population was to be 
identical to the ITT population, if all subjects admitted to the trial underwent prophylactic 
treatment. 
Population of BEs (BLEED): All documented BEs of subjects in the ITT population which received 
any amount of treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Surgery population (SURG): All documented surgical interventions of subjects in the ITT 
population which received Human-cl rhFVIII prior to, during or after the surgery is documented, 
but did not receive any other FVIII concentrate within 24 hours prior to surgery. 
The ITT analysis was considered to be the most relevant for efficacy data. To evaluate the 
robustness of the study results, efficacy analyses were also to be done on the basis of the PP 
population. 
The primary objective of this clinical study was to determine the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in 
previously treated subjects suffering from severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C ≤1%). This intent was 
three fold, demonstration of efficacy of prophylactic treatment in the ITT/PROPH population, of 
treatment of breakthrough bleeds in the BLEED population as well as of treatment in the context 
of surgery in the SURG population.

Efficacy of Prophylactic Treatment 
The efficacy was to be evaluated by descriptive statistics on bleeding rates and was to be 
presented in summary tables. The frequency of BEs under prophylactic treatment was to be 
calculated after a total of 50 EDs and at the end of the study in order to assess overall efficacy. 
The frequency of BEs (overall and by type of BE) under prophylactic treatment was to be 
calculated using the following definitions for the prophylactic treatment time period: 
- The time between first prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII until the administration of 
the 50th ED for the 50 ED analysis minus time periods from start of treatment for surgery until 
restart of every other day prophylactic treatment 
- The time between first prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII until last prophylactic 
treatment +2 days or study completion whichever comes first minus time periods from start of a 
surgery until restart of every other day prophylactic treatment. 
As per the statistical analysis plan the overall efficacy assessment after a total of 50 EDs and 
after end of the study was to be assessed by the frequency of spontaneous BEs (i.e. traumatic, 
post-operative or “Other” BE not included) as the primary analysis for prophylactic treatment. 
The frequency of traumatic and all (spontaneous, traumatic, other) BEs were defined as 
secondary analyses. 
The frequency of breakthrough BEs/months under prophylactic treatment was to be calculated 
and assessed as excellent, good, moderate or poor: 
Excellent: Less than 0.75 spontaneous BE per month. 
Good: Between 0.75 and 1 spontaneous BE per month. 
Moderate: Between more than 1 and 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month. 
Poor: More than 1.5 spontaneous BEs per month. 
Treatment of Breakthrough Bleeding Episodes 
The efficacy was to be evaluated by descriptive statistics on treated bleeds. 
The clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in on-demand treatment of breakthrough BEs was to be 
assessed by analysing the following parameters: Efficacy assessment by the subject at the end of 
the bleeding episode, together with the investigator in case of on-site treatment (excellent, good, 
moderate, none). In addition to the four point scale the proportion of BEs successfully treated 
with Human-cl rhFVIII was to be evaluated for all BEs. “Successfully treated” are all “excellent” 
and “good” efficacy ratings of treated BEs. 
Haemostatic control in Surgical Procedures 
The efficacy in the context of surgeries was to be evaluated by descriptive statistics. 
Efficacy was to be evaluated by the surgeon and the haematologist at the end of the surgery and 
on the last post-operative day. In addition to the four point scale (very good, good, moderate, 
none), the proportion of surgeries with successful treatment according to the overall efficacy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 47/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
assessment was to be presented. “Successfully treated” was defined as all “excellent” and “good” 
efficacy ratings of surgical procedures.  
No missing data imputation was foreseen with the exception of bodyweight, where the last 
available weight measurement was to be used. Subjects who permanently switched to another 
FVIII product during their study participation were to be considered treatment failures, i.e. the 
efficacy was to be imputed to be “none” for each haemostatic efficacy assessment after the 
switch in the efficacy analyses, unless the infusion of another FVIII concentrate was due to an 
emergency situation and if the IMP was not available for the patient in time.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted in 11 investigational centres in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany and the UK. 
First Patient In: 22-Jun-2010; Last Patient Out: 31-Jan-2012. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol version at the time of study start (v. 7, dated 16-Mar-2010) included amendments 
1–3, and was further amended to change end of trial from Q1 2011 to Q4 2011 and with other 
minor changes and clarifications.  
Thirty-one patients had a least one minor protocol deviation. Major protocol deviations were 
recorded in 5 patients. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of patients in GENA-08 are shown in Table 13.

N=32) 
FVIII inhibitor levels were less than 0.6 BU in 31 patients at screening. Patient 082101 had a 
relatively high FVIII:C of 0.649 IU/mL as measured by the OS assay at screening, probably due 
to an infusion of FVIII 1 to 2 days before as the patient was still receiving prophylaxis with a 
different FVIII concentrate at that time. Consequently, the results for the inhibitor measurement 
were reported as indeterminate because a potential low-titre inhibitor may have been masked by 
the high FVIII:C. The patient had inhibitor titres of less than 0.6 BU in all further measurements.

Main historical BE sites were the ankle (59.4% of patients both sides, 15.6% and 3.1% left and 
right ankle, respectively), the elbow (40.6% of patients both sides, 12.5% and 21.9% left and 
right elbow, respectively) and the knee (31.3% of patients both sides, 25.0% and 18.8% left and 
right knee, respectively). 
All 8 patients from the centre in Bulgaria and 3 patients from two UK centres had previously 
received on-demand treatment with an FVIII concentrate; the remaining 21 patients had 
received FVIII concentrates as prophylaxis. Overall, pdFVIII concentrates had been used in 10 
patients and rFVIII concentrates in 22 patients. 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy results for Human-cl rhFVIII are based on the ITT dataset. The efficacy of prophylaxis 
was analysed for all patients who received at least one prophylactic dose of Human-cl rhFVIII 
(PROPH population, N=32). Efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII for the treatment of BEs in patients 
receiving Human-cl rhFVIII as prophylaxis were analysed for all BEs treated with at least one 
dose of Human-cl rhFVIII (BLEED population, 30 BEs in 15 patients). Efficacy during surgery was 
analysed for surgical procedures where at least one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII was administered 
(SURG population, 5 surgeries in 5 patients).  
The SAF population included all patients who received at least one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII 
(N=32); this population is identical to the ITT population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Prophylaxis 
All 32 patients started prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII and were included in the 
PROPH population. The total number of prophylactic injections was 2722. 
A summary of the EDs and dosages with Human-cl rhFVIII for the treatment of BEs is shown in 
Table 14 and the frequency of BEs is shown in Table 15.

population, N=32) 
Table 15: 
Frequency of BEs during the study (PROPH population, N=32) 
The mean total number of BEs during the study was 1.4±2.4 per patient (median 0.5; range 0–
8). When excluding BEs occurring under surgical prophylaxis and BEs occurring between the first 
recovery dosing and start of prophylactic treatment, the mean number of BEs per patient during 
the study was 0.6±1.2 for spontaneous BEs (median 0; range 0–4) and 1.1±1.8 for all types of 
BEs (median 0.5; range 0–7). 
The mean BE rates per patient during the prophylactic treatment period at the end of the study 
were 0.095/month for spontaneous BEs (median 0; range 0–0.71) and 0.188/month (median 
0.074; range 0–1.21) for all types of BE. Consumption (e.g. 450 IU/month or 5400 IU/year for 
adults in GENA 08) has been provided and reflected in the SmPC. 
In all 11 patients who had received on-demand treatment prior to the study, monthly BE rates 
were markedly reduced; the mean BE rate in these patients decreased from 3.924 to 0.043. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014

Eight patients experienced no BEs at all during the study and the remaining three had low 
monthly BE rates of 0.148–0.166. 
In all 32 patients, the overall efficacy for spontaneous BEs was excellent (100%); for all types of 
BEs efficacy was excellent or good in 31 out of 32 patients (96.9%) and moderate one patient 
(3.1%). 
Treatment of BEs 
Out of the 44 BEs occurring during the study, 30 were treated with at least one dose of Human-cl 
rhFVIII. Of the 30 treated BEs, 14 were spontaneous, another 14 were due to trauma, and the 
remaining two were classified as ”other”. The most frequent sites of BEs were the ankle and the 
knee, which together accounted for 60% of all BEs. Personal efficacy assessments were used for 
analysis and were available for 28 BEs, 14 of which were minor and 14 were moderate to major. 
Efficacy ratings on a four-point scale were excellent or good for all BEs (Table 16). 
Table 16: 
Personal  efficacy  assessment  for  treatment  of  BEs  according  to  severity 
(BLEED population, 28 BEs in 15 patients) 
For 2 BEs, no personal efficacy assessment was available. At the end of the study, the IDMC 
adjudicated on all personal efficacy assessments, primarily considering the number of infusions 
administered for each BE. In six cases the IDMC assessment differed from the personal 
assessment. In three cases in which the personal assessment had been 'good', efficacy was 
judged 'moderate'; in two cases in which the personal assessment had been 'good', efficacy was

rated as 'excellent'; and in one case where no personal assessment was available, efficacy was 
rated as 'excellent' by the IDMC. 
Surgery 
The SURG population comprised 1 minor and 4 major surgeries in 5 patients. An overview of all 
surgical procedures included in the analysis is provided in Table 17. 
Table 17:  Description,  blood  loss  and  efficacy  rating  of  surgical  procedures  (SURG 
population, 5 surgeries in 5 patients) 
For 3 surgeries, average and maximum expected and actual blood loss were reported. For 2 
procedures with an expected average blood loss of 20 and 500 mL, no actual blood loss was 
observed; for one surgery, the actual blood loss was 100 mL, which was 50 mL higher than the 
average expected blood loss, but still markedly below the expected maximum blood loss of 600 
mL. 
For 4 surgeries (the minor and 3 major procedures), efficacy was rated as excellent intra-
operatively and overall. For one major surgery (patient 080302), intra-operative efficacy was 
rated as good and overall efficacy as moderate.

Notes 
A total of 65 treatment-emergent AEs were recorded in 21 of the 32 
patients (65.6%). Of these, 59 (90.8%) were mild (69.2%) or moderate 
(21.5%) in severity, and all except one case of exacerbation of arthralgia in 
a target joint were resolved without sequelae. Six AEs in 4 patients were 
rated as severe and two of those (occurring in 2 patients) were also rated as 
serious; one patient died following a status epilepticus. These 6 AEs were 
either due to an accident or could be explained by the patients' medical 
history; none were deemed related to Human-cl rhFVIII administration.  
Two patients experienced a total of 5 possibly related AEs. One patient 
reported injection site pain after the first infusion; the second patient 
experienced vertigo, dry mouth and paraesthesia after the first and injection 
site inflammation after the 15th administration of Human-cl rhFVIII. All of 
these 5 AEs were mild, non-serious and fully resolved without requiring any 
action. 
Analysis description  Statistical Analysis 
The statistical analysis of all endpoints was exploratory. No confirmatory 
hypothesis testing was planned. 
Due to the limited number of patients, no stratification for any subgroup 
analyses was performed, except for the analysis of the subgroups of 
patients with BEs and those with surgeries. 
AE = adverse event; BE = bleeding episode; BW = body weight; ED = exposure day; FVIII:C = FVIII 
coagulant activity; IVR = in vivo recovery; ITT = intention-to-treat; PTP = previously treated patient. 
GENA-03 
Methods 
Study participants 
The study population were paediatric PTPs (age ≥2 and 12 years) with severe haemophilia A 
(FVIII:C <1%) with at least 50 EDs to their current FVIII product. Patients were 
immunocompetent (CD4+ count >200/μL); HIV-negative or respective viral load <200 
particles/μL or <400,000 copies/mL; and written informed consent obtained. 
Exclusion criteria included: Other coagulation disorder than haemophilia A; present or past FVIII 
inhibitor activity (≥0.6 BU); target joints; severe liver or kidney disease (ALT and AST levels >5 
times of upper limit of normal, creatinine >120 μmol/L); receipt or scheduled receipt of immuno-
modulating drugs (other than antiretroviral chemotherapy) such as alpha-interferon, prednisone 
(>10 mg/day), or comparable drugs; current participation in another clinical study.

Treatments 
For prophylactic treatment in Phase II, 30–40 IU FVIII/kg BW of Human-cl rhFVIII were 
administered every other day or 3 times weekly until 6 months and ≥50 EDs had been fulfilled. 
Two dose escalations of each +5 IU/kg BW were allowed in case of an inadequate response (≥2 
spontaneous BEs within one month). The dosage and duration of treating spontaneous or 
traumatic breakthrough BEs within the prophylactic treatment period and during surgeries 
depended both on the location and on the extent of the BE, and on the clinical condition of the 
respective patient. The required dosage and target peak plasma levels were the same as 
described for GENA-08. The required dosage and the dosing recommendations given for surgical 
prophylaxis were the same as described for GENA-01. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in terms of prevention 
(prophylactic treatment) and treatment of (breakthrough) BEs in previously treated children 
suffering from severe haemophilia A (FVIII:C <1%). 
Secondary objectives of this trial were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To determine PK parameters (in up to 13 patients [12 evaluable] of each age group, 2 to 5 
and 6 to 12 years) of Human-cl rhFVIII. 
To determine the incremental IVR of Human-cl rhFVIII – also over time. 
To investigate the immunogenic potential of Human-cl rhFVIII by inhibitor titre. 
To assess clinical efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in surgeries. 
To assess safety of Human-cl rhFVIII in terms of adverse event (AE) monitoring. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy of prophylactic treatment on the basis of the frequency of spontaneous 
breakthrough BEs/months under prophylactic treatment was assessed as excellent, good, 
moderate or poor as described for GENA-08. 
Efficacy assessments for the treatment of BEs and during surgery were the same as described for 
GENA-01 and GENA-08. 
Sample size 
No inferential analysis involving formal testing was planned in this uncontrolled study. 
Consequently, no formal sample size estimation was performed, but the sample size was chosen 
to satisfy current CHMP recommendations. According to the CHMP Guideline on the Clinical 
Investigation of new FVIII products, a study in children is to be performed in at least 50 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014

suffering from severe haemophilia A. Of those 50, at least 25 should be aged between 2 and 5 
and at least 25 aged between 6 and 12 years. It was thus planned to include a total of 60 
patients (30 aged 2–5 years and 30 aged 6–12 years) into the study in order to be able to 
compensate for discontinuations. 26 patients – 13 of each age cohort – were to participate in the 
PK phase (Phase I) of the study. 
Randomisation 
The study design did not require any randomisation. Study data were stratified as follows: 
- Patients aged 2–5 years / with PK 
- Patients aged 2–5 years / without PK 
- Patients aged 6–12 years / with PK 
- Patients aged 6–12 years / without PK. 
Blinding (masking)

Statistical methods 
Statistical Study Conduct 
A statistical analysis plan was compiled as a separate document. No inferential statistics, but 
rather exploratory and descriptive statistics were planned for this uncontrolled efficacy trial. The 
statistical analysis of the primary, secondary and safety endpoints was thought to be understood 
in the exploratory sense. 
The final subject disposition, i.e. the identification of significant violations to consider for the PP, 
the PK-PP, and the PROPH-PP population and the assignment of each subject to these analysis 
populations, was to be the joint decision of the trial statistician and the responsible medical 
expert in a data review meeting prior to database lock. 
Statistical analysis of the primary endpoints 
All results were stratified by the age groups (2-<6 years, 6-12 years) and in total. Efficacy was 
evaluated by descriptive statistics. The frequency of BEs under prophylactic treatment was 
calculated after a total of 50 EDs and at the end of the study in order to assess overall efficacy. 
The frequency of spontaneous BEs only and for all BEs under prophylactic treatment was 
calculated. The frequencies of traumatic BEs and of all (spontaneous, traumatic, other) BEs were 
defined as secondary analyses. The efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in the treatment of 
breakthrough BEs and during surgical prophylaxis were assessed as described for GENA-08.

See Figure 4. 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 15 investigational centres in the UK, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, 
Turkey, France and Romania. The trial was initiated on 27 December 2010 and completed on 6 
November 2012. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments to the CSP dated 22-Mar-2010. Amendment 1, dated 17-Jun- 
2011, addressed the issue of prophylactic dosing. After it was realised that patients were 
reluctant to enter the study because of the every-other-day dosing specified in the protocol, the 
dosing recommendation was changed to also allow 3-times-weekly dosing. 
Amendment 2, dated 07-Oct-2011, addressed the required number of evaluable patients for PK 
analysis. This was done in response to the change in EMA guideline specifying that 12, not 13, 
evaluable patients per age cohort need to undergo PK evaluation. 
There were several changes in the planned analyses compared with the latest version of the 
protocol expected to have limited impact on the study results.  
Major protocol deviations were recorded in 3 of the 59 patients. Two patients received other 
FVIII concentrate after the start of prophylaxis. One patient had an extremely long gap between 
2 doses after start of prophylactic treatment. Fifty-seven patients had a least one minor protocol 
deviation (higher prophylactic dose, wash-out period for recovery was not respected; FVIII 
sampling was outside the specified time window). 
Baseline data 
All patients enrolled in the study were male. In accordance with the inclusion criteria, patients 
were between 2 and 12 years of age, with a median age of 6 years. Total HJHS at baseline 
(range 0 [best] to 148 [worst]) ranged from 0 to 11, with a median score of 0, indicating good 
joint health, as expected in this paediatric population of PTPs. 
The main historical BE sites were the ankle (11.9% of patients both sides; 11.9% and 18.6% left 
and right ankle, respectively; 1.7% unknown), the knee (8.5% of patients both sides; 10.2% 
and 11.9% left and right knee, respectively) and the leg (10.2% of patients both sides; 5.1% 
and 3.4% left and right leg, respectively; 1.7% unknown).

All patients were white and not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; most patients had blood type O 
(25; 42.4%) or A (24; 40.7%). Known FVIII gene defects were documented for 56 out of the 59 
patients; most were single occurrence, except for intron 22 inversion and missense mutations, 
which were observed in 25 (42.4%) and 11 (18.6%) patients, respectively. A family history of 
haemophilia was documented in less than half of the patients (24; 40.7%); 4 patients (6.8%) 
had a family history of inhibitor activity. 
In the 6 months prior to the study, 33 of the 59 patients had received rFVIII concentrates and 27 
of the 59 patients had received pdFVIII concentrates; 5 of the 59 patients had received both 
pdFVIII and rFVIII concentrates in the previous 6 months. Six patients had previously received 
on-demand treatment and 53 patients had received FVIII concentrates as prophylaxis.

A total of 59 patients were enrolled in this study. Of these, 56 completed the study and 3 
prematurely discontinued. All 59 patients were included in the safety and the ITT populations. All 
59 patients received prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII (PROPH population). A total of 
108 breakthroughs BEs were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII (BLEED population) in 32 patients in 
the PROPH population. Surgery with at least one dose of Human-cl rhFVIII was performed in 6 
patients during 6 procedures. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Prophylaxis 
All 59 patients received prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII and were included in the 
PROPH population. The total number of prophylactic injections was 5316. 
The average dose per infusion (38.9 IU/kg) was towards the higher end of 30–40 IU/kg range 
due to the rounding up of doses to the nearest vial. As only whole 500 IU vials were infused, in 
patients in whom, for example, one vial would be at the lower end of, or below, the 
recommended range, the investigators chose to increase the dose at some point to two vials and 
have a dose at the top end of the range. 
EDs and dosage of Human-cl rhFVIII for prophylaxis are shown in Table 20. 
Table 20: 
EDs and dosage for prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII (PROPH 
population, N=59) 
A total of 129 BEs were experienced by 39 patients during the prophylactic treatment. Of these 
129 BEs, 74 (57.4%) were traumatic, 45 (34.9%) were spontaneous and 10 (7.7%) were 
classified as “other”. In the PROPH population, 20 (33.9%) patients did not experience any BEs 
and 14 patients (23.7%) experienced only one BE during the study. Overall efficacy assessments 
of Human-cl rhFVIII prophylaxis are shown in Table 21.

Table 21:  Overall efficacy assessment of prophylactic treatment at the end* of the 
study (PROPH population, N=59) 
The mean rate of spontaneous BEs was 0.123 BEs/month (median 0; range 0–1.13) at the end 
of the study; the monthly rate of spontaneous BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 5 than in 
those aged 6 to 12 years (0.089 vs. 0.156 BEs/month). The monthly rate of traumatic BEs was 
higher than that observed for spontaneous BEs, although rates in the two age groups followed a 
similar pattern. The mean rate of traumatic BEs was 0.192 BEs/month (median 0.129; range 0–
1.53) at the end of the study; the monthly rate of traumatic BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 
5 than in those aged 6 to 12 years (0.113 vs. 0.268 BEs/month). The mean rate of all BEs was 
0.338 BEs/month (median 0.156; range 0–1.70) at the end of the study; the monthly rate of all 
BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 5 than in those aged 6 to 12 years (0.213 vs. 0.459 
BEs/month).

Treatment of breakthrough BEs 
A total of 108 BEs (32 patients) were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII and comprised the BLEED 
population. 
Of the 108 BEs, 65 (60.2%) were traumatic, 36 (33.3%) were spontaneous and 7 (6.5%) were 
classified as “other”. Sixty-one (56.5%) of the BEs were minor, 46 (42.6%) were moderate to 
major and one (0.9%) was of unknown severity. There were no major to life-threatening BEs. 
The most frequent sites of BEs were the ankle (21 BEs) and the knee (15 BEs).  
When one infusion was given to treat several BEs simultaneously, the number of EDs and the 
number of dosages were counted only once. A total of 216 infusions were used in this analysis. 
The median number of infusions to treat a BE across all severities was 1.0 and the mean number 
was 2.1 (range 1–22). The difference between the mean and median values is mainly due to 1 
BE that was treated with 22 infusions.  
EDs and dosage of Human-cl rhFVIII for the treatment of BEs are shown in Table 22. For the 
whole BLEED population, the mean dose of Human-cl rhFVIII per infusion was 45.1±12.61 IU/kg 
(range 25–88 IU/kg) across all severities; it was 43.9±12.17 IU/kg for minor BEs and 
45.7±12.84 IU/kg for moderate to major BEs. The median total dose used for the treatment of a 
BE was 1,612.5 IU (range 500–33,000).

During the study, 68.6% BEs were treated with one infusion and 81.3% with one or 2 infusions. 
Six (5.9%) BEs required 3 infusions and 4 (3.9%) BEs required 4 infusions. Two BEs each (2.0% 
each) required 5, 6 and 8 infusions and 1 BE each (1.0% each) required 12, 15 and 22 infusions. 
Efficacy assessments for the treatment of BEs are shown in Table 23. 
Table 23: 
Efficacy assessment for treatment of BEs according to severity (BLEED 
population, 108 BEs in 32 patients) 
The 2 BEs for which Human-cl rhFVIII efficacy was rated as “none” were of moderate to major 
severity and are described in more detail: 
One patient experienced a spontaneous moderate to major bleeding in the right ankle that was 
treated with 12,000 IU of Human-cl rhFVIII over 10 EDs (12 infusions) -subsequently withdrawn 
from the study, after 71 days in the study, due to therapy failure. The second patient 
experienced a spontaneous moderate to major BE in the right arm that was treated with a total 
of 5,000 IU of Human-cl rhFVIII. He received 47.6 IU/kg (1000 IU) Human-cl rhFVIII daily over 5 
EDs, with no dose changes and no treatment with other FVIII concentrates. He was treated with 
Efferalgan and Doliprane (paracetamol) during the course of this BE. He experienced 8 other BEs, 
the treatment of which was rated as excellent or good in 5 and moderate in 3 BEs and the overall 
efficacy of prophylactic treatment for this patient was rated as moderate. This patient’s IVR 
values ranged from 1.24 to 1.59%/IU/kg. 
Assessment report

The IDMC adjudicated on all personal efficacy assessments for the treatment of BEs, primarily 
considering the number of infusions administered for each BE. In three cases the IDMC 
assessment differed from the personal assessment. In one case (patient 030202, BE no. 4) in 
which the personal assessment was rated as “good”, efficacy was judged “moderate” by the 
IDMC; in another case (BE no. 4) in which the personal assessment had been “excellent”, 
efficacy was rated as “good” by the IDMC. In addition, in another case (BE no. 1) in which the 
personal assessment was rated as “moderate”, efficacy was judged as “none” by the IDMC 
during the final IDMC meeting for this study after database lock. 
Surgery 
Six patients underwent 6 planned surgical procedures under Human-cl rhFVIII treatment (Table 
24). All surgeries were major. 
Table 24:  Description and efficacy rating of surgical procedures (SURG population, 6 
surgeries in 6 patients) 
Excluding the patient with VWD, individual doses for the 5 surgeries ranged from 28.25 IU/kg to 
56.50 IU/kg. All 5 patients received a 50 IU/kg loading dose before their surgeries, except 
patient 034114 who received 56.50 IU/kg. No maintenance doses during surgery were required 
for any patient. The number of infusions ranged from 3 to 5 and the number of EDs ranged from 
2 to 4, with the exception of one patient who underwent a port catheter implantation and 
received 20 infusions during 7 EDs. Blood loss during all these surgeries was minimal (2–10 mL), 
with the highest amount of 10 mL each for a port catheter implantation and a circumcision. One 
port catheter implantation surgery had higher than average expected blood loss; however, the 
actual blood loss was very low (4 mL) and not higher than the maximum expected blood loss (5 
mL). Efficacy was rated as excellent by both the surgeon and the haematologist for all 5 of these 
surgeries. One patient was treated with tranexamic acid during the hospitalisation after surgery. 
In the patient with VWD, a total dose of 160 IU/kg (4 infusions of 40 IU/kg) was administered for

a port catheter replacement. Actual blood loss (5 mL) was the same as the maximum expected 
volume. Efficacy was not assessed in the patient. The mean duration of surgeries was 33.3±6.06 
minutes, ranging from 30 to 45 minutes. The mean expected duration was 40 minutes for all 
surgeries.

Summary of main efficacy results 
Prophylactic efficacy 
The mean rate of all BEs was 0.338 BEs/month (median 0.156; range 0–1.70) at the end of the 
study; the monthly rate of all BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 5 than in those aged 6 to 12 
years (0.213 vs. 0.459 BEs/month). 
Haemostatic response 
Efficacy assessments were available for all 108 BEs treated with Human-cl rhFVIII, 61 of which 
were minor, 46 were moderate to major and the severity of 1 BE was unknown. Efficacy was 
rated as excellent or good for 89 BEs (82.4%; excellent 71.3%, good 11.1%); 17 (15.7%) BEs 
had an efficacy rating of moderate and 2 (1.9%) BEs had an efficacy rating of “none”.

Numbers of infusions needed to stop a BE 
During the study, 68.6% BEs were treated with one infusion and 81.3% with one or 2 infusions. 
Six (5.9%) BEs required 3 infusions and 4 (3.9%) BEs required 4 infusions. Two BEs each (2.0% 
each) required 5, 6 and 8 infusions and 1 BE each (1.0% each) required 12, 15 and 22 infusions. 
FVIII consumption 
For prophylaxis, the average dose per infusion was 38.9 IU/kg. The average amount of Human-cl 
rhFVIII per month was 527.7 IU/kg. 
For the treatment of BEs, the mean dose of Human-cl rhFVIII per infusion was 45.1±12.61 IU/kg 
(range 25–88 IU/kg) across all severities; it was 43.9±12.17 IU/kg for minor BEs and 
45.7±12.84 IU/kg for moderate to major BEs. The median total dose used for the treatment of a 
BE was 1612.5 IU (range 500–33,000). 
Haemostatic response surgery 
Six patients underwent 6 planned surgical procedures under Human-cl rhFVIII treatment. All 
surgeries were major. Excluding one patient who was subsequently diagnosed with VWD and for 
whom efficacy was not assessed, efficacy was rated as excellent by both the surgeon and the 
haematologist for all 5 major surgeries.

Clinical studies in special populations 
See Study GENA-03 in paediatric patients. 
Supportive studies 
Two studies (GENA-09 and its extension GENA-04) were conducted in a single centre in Russia. 
This patient population is characterised by less intensive haemophilia control and advanced 
sequelae e.g. target joints and a history of high rates of BEs with a high incidence of severe BEs. 
Prophylactic efficacy in study GENA-09 was lowest of all studies (90.9% excellent or good). Still, 
even in this study, there was only 1 patient with poor prophylactic efficacy and only 2 with 
moderate efficacy. Importantly, at the end of GENA-04, the extension of study GENA-09, efficacy 
ratings markedly improved to excellent in all but one patient (94.4%), suggesting that long-term 
prophylactic treatment with Human-cl rhFVIII may improve outcomes even in patients who have 
previously received inadequate treatment.  
Long-term prophylactic treatment (GENA-04) with Human-cl rhFVIII with an average dose of 
34.6 IU/kg resulted in a decrease in both HJHS (total and gait) and BE rates compared with the 
patients’ values prior to Human-cl rhFVIII prophylaxis. The overall efficacy of the prophylactic 
treatment was deemed excellent in 94% and good in 6% of the patients. With the average dose 
of 34.63 IU/kg per infusion for the treatment of BEs, the haemostatic efficacy rating of Human-cl 
rhFVIII was excellent or good for 83.7% of BEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 72/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
Overall surgical efficacy was rated as excellent in 14 minor surgical procedures in GENA-09 and 
as excellent for 4 minor surgical procedures and good for 3 major surgeries in GENA-04 by the 
surgeon and the haematologist. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the submitted pivotal clinical trials investigating the efficacy (GENA-01, GENA-08 
and GENA-03) of Human-cl rhFVIII follows the requirements of the guideline for rFVIII products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009). One trial (GENA-01) investigated the efficacy of Human-cl 
rhFVIII for the on-demand treatment of BEs in 22 patients with severe haemophilia A. Two trials 
investigated the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII for the prophylaxis and treatment of breakthrough 
BEs in 32 adults (GENA-08) and 59 children (GENA-03). In all three studies, the investigation of 
the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII for surgical interventions was foreseen. 
The included patient population of the three pivotal studies was multinational and comprised 
previously treated children (2-<12 years of age), 3 adolescents (12, 12 and 14 years) and adults 
suffering from severe haemophilia A, which was defined as FVIII levels <1% for the paediatric 
trial and ≤1% for the adult/adolescent trials. According to the current guideline, severe 
haemophilia patients with FVIII activity <1% should be enrolled. According to the guideline 
CPMP/BPWG/1561/99 rev.1 valid at the time of the initiation of the trials in the adolescent and 
adult population, patients with FVIII activity ≤1 were the target population. Therefore the 
definition of severe haemophilia A is considered acceptable.  
The primary efficacy analysis for GENA-01 (on-demand treatment) focused on the proportion of 
BEs with successful treatment (rated as “good” or “excellent” in the efficacy assessment at the 
end of the BE). A BE was considered as treatment failure, if the efficacy assessment was 
“moderate” or “none” or if another FVIII product was used.  
For GENA-08 (prophylaxis in adults), the overall efficacy assessment after a total of 50 EDs and 
after end of the study was based upon the frequency of spontaneous BEs (i.e. traumatic, post-
operative or “other” BE not included). The frequency of traumatic BEs and all (spontaneous, 
traumatic, other) BEs were addressed, in addition. 
For GENA-03 (prophylaxis in children), two calculations for the primary endpoint on BE rate 
during prophylaxis were specified (frequency of spontaneous BEs only and all BEs). The efficacy 
of Human-cl rhFVIII in on-demand treatment of breakthrough BEs was assessed by a four-point 
efficacy assessment at the end of a BE. Additionally, the proportion of BEs successfully treated 
with Human-cl rhFVIII was evaluated for all BEs. “Successfully treated” were all “excellent” and 
“good” efficacy ratings of treated BEs.  
For all surgical procedures, efficacy was to be evaluated by the surgeon and the haematologist at 
the end of the surgery and on the last post-operative day. In addition to the four-point scale 
(excellent, good, moderate, none), the proportion of surgeries with successful treatment 
according to the overall efficacy assessment was calculated. “Successfully treated” was defined 
as all “excellent” and “good” efficacy ratings of surgical procedures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 73/90 
 
 
  
  
Generally, dosing recommendations for prophylaxis and the treatment of BEs were in line with 
the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) Guideline recommendations as well as with the core 
SmPC. A higher consumption for prophylaxis per month was observed in the paediatric study 
(median: 521.9 IU/kg) as compared to prophylaxis for the adults (468.7 IU/kg/month). 
The protocol violations noted in each study were examined in a routine GCP inspection of trials 
GENA-01 and GENA-03 initiated by the EMA. The inspectors concluded that the data in the 
Clinical Study Report presented as a whole, was considered reliable and suitable for assessment 
in an MAA. 
In general, the clinical study programme follows the current Clinical Guideline regarding 
objectives, duration and outline. Prophylaxis, on-demand treatment and prophylaxis in surgical 
procedures have been documented and evaluated. 
Patient selection, in general, follows widely accepted use in comparable study-designs.  
Providing data from a differing patient population from Russia (GENA-09 and GENA-04) is 
considered to be supportive, only. However, these data are valuable with respect to efficacy of 
FVIII substitution in a specific and challenging patient population with advanced disease sequelae 
representing treatment conditions less developed than in Western European countries. 
According to long-standing experience with similar products, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of 
FVIII per kg body weight (IU/kg BW) at intervals of 2 to 3 days for prophylaxis against BEs in 
patients with severe haemophilia A. In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter 
dosage intervals or higher doses may be necessary. Presented dosages are within this range, 
although at the upper margins. These recommendations are included in the SmPC Section 4.2. 
The dosing interval has been chosen as “every other day” which is in line with recent positive 
experience with short dosing intervals with respect to overall FVIII consumption. Justification of 
such an interval to maintain stable FVIII concentrations above 1% activity – without reaching 
high peak levels, is acknowledged. 
The suggested assessment for efficacy in prophylaxis based upon monthly BE rates is considered 
to be acceptable. Furthermore, annual (monthly) consumption per kg BW (bodyweight) in 
prophylaxis is requested by the Clinical Guideline has been provided (see below). 
Recommended dosing for BEs and surgeries was in line with recommendations for clinical studies 
and the core SmPC. It is considered to be acceptable to allow individual dosage according to the 
clinical situation.  
An evaluation score for haemostatic efficacy has been used in addition to the number of infusions 
and the time for resolution after a BE, which is accepted. FVIII dosage per kg and BE has been 
presented, as well as differentiation of all evaluations for “true” on-demand BEs versus BEs 
under prophylaxis (breakthrough BEs). 
Evaluation of efficacy in surgery has been based upon objective criteria. Furthermore, data on 
blood loss, need for transfusions and FVIII consumption per kg and surgical procedure have been 
provided in accordance with the Clinical Guideline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 74/90 
 
  
  
Patient numbers in general meet the recommendations of the Guideline. A high number of 
protocol violations in each study was investigated in a routine GCP inspection of trials GENA-01 
and GENA-03, which had a positive outcome. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  GENA-01,  94.4%  (931/986)  of  the  BEs  were  treated  with  excellent  or  good  efficacy  (60.3% 
excellent,  34.1%  good).  A  large  majority  of  BEs  required  only  one  Human-cl  rhFVIII  infusion 
(841/986, 91.4%) and 53 BEs (5.8%) required 2 infusions. The mean BE rates per patient during 
the  prophylactic  treatment  period  at  the  end  of  GENA-08  study  were  0.188/month  (median 
0.074;  range  0–1.21)  for  all  types  of  BEs.  Personal  efficacy  assessments  were  available  for  28 
BEs.  Efficacy  ratings  on  a  four-point  scale  were  excellent  or  good  for  all  BEs  (71.4%  (20/28) 
excellent, 28.6% (8/28) good). 
Due to the small patient population uncertainty on the estimates is large. The applicant provided 
analyses across trials as an obvious means to increase efficiency and the precision of estimates, 
both  for  prophylactic  efficacy  and  for  haemostatic  success  in  treatment  of  BEs  with  Human-cl 
rhFVIII, and for the surgical procedure setting. 
Efficacy of prophylaxis: For prophylaxis, no specific guidance regarding efficacy evaluation is 
available through the Clinical Guideline. However, the suggested recording of monthly BE rates 
represents an instrument for describing efficacy in the respective regimen. Interpretation of the 
BE rates might well be influenced by age (children) or predisposition (target joints). From the 
presented data, differentiation of spontaneous, traumatic and overall BEs is considered to be of 
relevance. 
An overview on efficacy assessment based on monthly BE rates (spontaneous, traumatic and all 
BEs) has been provided.  
Efficacy of treatment of BEs: An individually driven 4-point scale is suggested by the Clinical 
Guideline, which has been met by the study design. From the study description, it might be 
assumed, that GENA-01 represents mostly “true” on-demand BEs whereas the BEs from other 
studies represent breakthrough BEs.  
Further variability between the studies may mainly be attributed to the differing patient 
population. However, the significant differences e.g. between GENA-09 and GENA-08 
demonstrate that efficacy assessment in this kind of condition remains highly challenging. 
According to the Clinical Guideline, dose per kg (IU/kg) per BE should be provided. Median dose 
per kg and BE was 30.9 IU/kg (range 8–657) in study GENA-01. For completeness, overall mean 
dose/kg per BE and mean dose/kg per major versus moderate versus minor BE have been 
provided. 
Monthly consumption of FVIII for prophylaxis in GENA-08 (468.7 IU/kg) and GENA-03 (521.9 
IU/kg) has been provided and is reflected in the SmPC.  
Consumption data in studies GENA-09 and GENA-04 are considered supportive, as these studies 
represent a specific patient population. Improvement of BE control and even joint health is 
noted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 75/90 
 
 
  
  
Efficacy of surgical prophylaxis: Data illustrate variability of dosage for minor vs. major surgical 
procedures and the differences of standards between Western European countries and e.g. 
Russia: Total doses as well as supportive measures differ substantially, but are considered to 
represent known variability. 
Taking all presented studies together, data regarding surgical procedures meet the requirements 
of the Clinical Guideline of a minimum of 10 major surgical procedures in at least 5 patients. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Paediatric patients were addressed in study GENA-03. Patient characteristics were well described. 
There were only 3 patients in the paediatric age-group between 12 and 18 years (ages 12, 12 
and 14 years), with a gap between the ages of 14 to 18 years. Dosing in paediatric patients will 
remain challenging due to specific needs in these age groups. Children of less than 2 years of 
age have not been included in the clinical trial. However, in the context of this congenital 
disease, there is a potential relevant use in children below 2 years. Taking into account the 
current data as well as the fact that it is a recombinant product, the knowledge with existing 
therapies could support the use of the product in this age group. As there is an absence of any 
concern (safety concern, posology or immunological aspect) that could impose a restriction, it 
was considered that the data can be extrapolated so this age range is covered by the indication, 
provided the patients are previously treated. 
The mean rate of all BEs in GENA-03 (prophylaxis) was 0.338 BEs/month (median 0.156; range 
0–1.70) at the end of the study; the monthly rate of all BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 5 
than in those aged 6 to 12 years (0.213 vs. 0.459 BEs/month). During the study, 68.6% of 
breakthrough BEs were treated with one infusion and 81.3% with one or 2 infusions. 
Differences in the monthly BE rate and dosage between paediatric and adult patients support the 
phenomenon of children requiring higher doses and shorter intervals of dosage for sufficient 
treatment. 
Analysis of BE frequency as an efficacy assessment in prophylaxis for two age-subgroups shows 
higher frequency for the older (6–12 years) than for the younger (2–5 years) age-group. 
Consumption was 519 IU/kg monthly or 6230 IU/kg per year, which has been reflected within 
the SmPC. 
The number of infusions for treatment of a breakthrough BE was between 1 and 22 with the 
majority being 1 or 2 infusions. However, BEs requiring 5, 6, 8, and even 12, 15 and 22 infusions 
were recorded. Median dose per kg and BE was 43.9 IU/kg (range 25-1521).  
Statistical analyses using methods compatible with the data type of BE rates with appropriate 
confidence intervals have been provided. Additional analyses were provided aiming to estimate 
the success of treating BEs in a manner which accounts for this situation or which is not prone to 
the correlated structure of the data. Furthermore, due to the small patient population analyses 
were performed across trials for prophylactic efficacy, for haemostatic success in treatment of 
BEs (in the on-demand and the prophylaxis setting), and for the surgical procedure setting which 
confirm the individual findings.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy has been analysed for prophylaxis, on-demand treatment, treatment of breakthrough 
BEs, and prophylaxis for surgical procedures. Study designs, selection and number of patients, 
assessment tools and results are in general adequate for supporting efficacy of Nuwiq. Minor 
additional changes or supplements to the SmPC were requested to adequately reflecting the 
efficacy profile.  
The available clinical data for Nuwiq suggest that it could be an efficacious new FVIII product for 
the prevention and treatment of BEs in PTPs with haemophilia A. Uncertainties concerning the 
multitude of protocol deviations were clarified by GCP inspections and adequately addressed by 
the applicant. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of Human-cl rhFVIII was assessed in 135 patients with severe haemophilia A 
in 5 studies with 59 patients under the age of 12 years. All clinical safety data were adjudicated 
by the IDMC. To date, there have been no reports of virus transmission, hypersensitivity, 
thromboembolism or inhibitor development related to Human-cl rhFVIII. 
Patient exposure 
135 individual patients received a mean of 104,813 to 585,489 IU (1835 to 6289 IU/kg) of 
Human-cl rhFVIII by a mean of 54.9 to 228 infusions over a mean of 53.3 to 226 EDs and over a 
mean period of 179.9 to 455.6 days during the clinical studies. Across the 5 studies, patients 
received a total of 32,650,787 IU (549,033 IU/kg) of Human-cl rhFVIII by 16,134 infusions over 
15,950 EDs (Table 30).

Adverse events 
Potential safety concerns associated with the use of rFVIII concentrates include allergic-type 
hypersensitivity reactions and the possibility of formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to 
FVIII. The risk of transmission of infective agents with rFVIII is virtually completely eliminated. 
Three aspects of the safety of Human-cl rhFVIII were evaluated: tolerability, immunogenic 
potential and safety laboratory tests. 
AEs (272) were reported in 79 patients. All of these events occurred in patients under treatment 
with Human-cl rhFVIII. The most commonly affected system organ class (SOC) was that of 
infections and infestations, which were recorded for 57 patients. 
Twelve of the 242 AEs in 9 patients were classified as serious. Eight AEs were considered to be 
possibly or probably related to Human-cl rhFVIII treatment (Table 31).

Table 31:  AEs possibly/probably related to treatment 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One death occurred in the GENA-08 study that was deemed not related to Human-cl rhFVIII 
administration. This patient had been diagnosed with epilepsy and had been taking an 
antiepileptic (oxycarbazepin, 300 mg twice a day) since 1997. The last documented IMP infusion 
according to the patient diary was 48 days before his death following a status epilepticus. The 
case record form (CRF) states acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure as the cause of death. 
There were 11 additional serious AEs (SAEs) in 8 patients in the 5 studies: 3 SAEs (in 2 patients) 
in GENA-01, 7 SAEs (in 5 patients) in GENA-03 and 1 SAE (in 1 patient) in GENA-08. An 
overview is presented in Table 32.

Listing of SAEs 
Laboratory findings 
Routine laboratory tests for haematology parameters, clinical chemistry and electrolytes were 
performed in all studies. Urinalysis was additionally performed in studies GENA-01 and GENA-09. 
If abnormal values of ALT or AST persisted for more than one week, viral serology (hepatitis B 
virus [HBV], hepatitis C virus [HCV]) and PCR testing was to be performed to rule out HBV and 
HCV infection. In addition, PCR testing of the corresponding IMP batches was to be performed. 
No patients have been found to be positive for these viruses in any studies so far. 
Safety in special populations 
No specific evaluation regarding paediatric safety has been provided. However, a comparative AE 
listing reflecting AEs by SOC and preferred term (PT) was provided showing accumulations for 
Assessment report

AEs typical for the paediatric age-group, such as upper respiratory infections or injuries. No 
evidence for additional age-specific signals can be identified according to this information. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One patient in the GENA-01 study terminated the study prematurely due to loss to follow-up. 
Two patients each did not complete the GENA-04 and GENA-08 studies. Three of these 4 
patients discontinued prematurely due to withdrawal of consent after 14, 17 and 117 EDs; in 
GENA-08 one patient died after 67 EDs following a status epilepticus that was deemed 
unrelated to study treatment. Two patients were withdrawn in the GENA-03 study. One patient 
was withdrawn due to protocol violation (a new diagnosis of VWD and thus a violation of the 
inclusion criteria after 24 EDs) and a second patient was withdrawn due to therapy failure after 
42 EDs. There were no premature discontinuations in the GENA-09 study. 
Post-marketing experience 
Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
135 individual patients were treated with Human-cl rhFVIII in 5 completed clinical studies 
(GENA-01, GENA-08, GENA-03, GENA-09 and GENA-04) and provided safety data that were 
adjudicated by the IDMC. 
Dosages with respect to PK, treatment for BEs, prophylaxis in surgery and prophylaxis regimen 
have been provided and are considered to range in the upper margins of common use of similar 
medicinal products. 
272 AEs were reported in 79 patients. All of these events occurred in patients under treatment 
with Human-cl rhFVIII. Twelve of the 242 AEs in 9 patients were classified as serious and eight 
AEs were considered to be possibly or probably related to the treatment. 
Description of common AEs is considered to reflect a profile of similar products. Outcome of the 
very low titre anti-FVIII antibody as measured by ELISA (inhibitor titre <0.6 BU) from GENA-04 
reflected as “unknown” was further discussed and found to be non-neutralising. Furthermore, the 
IDMC identified 3 cases of mild rash and 3 cases of mild to moderate chills in temporal 
relationship with the administration of the product in study GENA-03. Relevance of these cases 
has been subject to further evaluation which did not reveal any safety concern. All other 
described non-inhibitory antibodies that were already present at baseline are considered to 
reflect a low incidence of not well understood immunological responses. As Human-cl rhFVIII is 
produced in HEK cells lacking non-human material, other immunological responses might be of 
theoretical relevance, only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 81/90 
 
 
 
 
  
  
There were 11 additional SAEs in 8 patients in the 5 studies. None of the cases was considered to 
be related with the administration of Human-cl rhFVIII. The profile of the SAEs was considered to 
be in line with similar products. 
One death occurred in the GENA-08 study. The patient had been diagnosed with epilepsy and 
had been taking an antiepileptic therapy (oxycarbazepin, 300 mg twice a day) since 1997. The 
CRF states acute respiratory and cardiovascular failure as the cause of death. 
Routine laboratory investigations and evaluation of vital signs did not show any signals. Viral 
safety was described to follow accepted standards including two specific steps of viral removal. 
No seroconversions have been reported so far. 
To date, there have been no reports of virus transmission, hypersensitivity, thromboembolism or 
inhibitor development related to Human-cl rhFVIII. However, as the database is small, these 
potential risks as identified in the product class were reflected in the SmPC. 
A comparative AE listing reflecting AEs by SOC and PT has been provided for the clinical studies, 
showing accumulations of AEs typical for the paediatric age-group as upper respiratory infections 
or injuries. No evidence for additional age-specific signals has been identified according to this 
information. 
All the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials in the safety database have been included in 
the SmPC. As adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred only once and the total number of studied 
patients was 135, the frequency was reported as “uncommon”. These were paraesthesia, 
headache, vertigo, dry mouth, back pain, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, non-
neutralising anti-FVIII antibody positive. 
Even though no inhibitors were detected, as this is recognised as an important aspect across the 
class, and considering the limited database, it was decided that statements on the inhibitor 
development are reflected in the SmPC in Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 as warnings. The risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions is addressed as relevant warnings and contra-indications in the SmPC. 
Lack of knowledge in previously untreated patients (PUPs) and in children younger than 2 years 
is reflected in the posology section of the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Clinical safety has been analysed from the data of all clinical trial phases. Evaluation in general 
follows the currently valid Clinical Guideline. The presented results are considered to be 
acceptable.  
Particular emphasis during the analysis and discussion of the safety data was given to 
immunogenicity and development of FVIII antibodies. Further studies and registry data (see 
pharmacovigilance plan and RMP) will monitor safety issues of special interest.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Three pivotal clinical trials investigating the efficacy of simoctocog alfa for the prevention and 
treatment of BEs in PTPs with severe haemophilia A as well as the haemostatic efficacy for 
surgical procedures have been submitted. Study GENA-01 investigated the efficacy in on-demand 
treatment of BEs in 22 adolescent and adult patients. Study GENA-08 investigated the efficacy of 
simoctocog alfa for the prophylaxis of BEs and the treatment of breakthrough BEs in 32 adults. 
Study GENA-03 investigated the efficacy of simoctocog alfa in 59 paediatric patients between 2 
and 11 years of age. 
In GENA-01 in overall, 94.4% (931/986) of the BEs were treated with excellent or good efficacy 
(60.3% excellent, 34.1% good). A large majority of BEs required only one infusion (841/986, 
91.4%) and 53 BEs (5.8%) required 2 infusions.  
The mean BE rates per patient during the prophylactic treatment period at the end of GENA-08 
study were 0.188/month (median 0.074; range 0–1.21) for all types of BEs. Personal efficacy 
assessments were available for 28 BEs. Efficacy ratings on a four-point scale were excellent or 
good for all BEs (71.4% (20/28) excellent, 28.6% (8/28) good). 
The mean rate of all BEs in GENA-03 (prophylaxis) was 0.338 BEs/month (median 0.156; range 
0–1.70) at the end of the study; the monthly rate of all BEs was lower in patients aged 2 to 5 
than in those aged 6 to 12 years (0.213 vs. 0.459 BEs/month). For breakthrough BEs occurring 
during the study, 68.6% of BEs were treated with one infusion and 81.3% with one or 2 
infusions.  
Furthermore, the PK properties of simoctocog alfa were investigated in the PK part of the 
paediatric trial indicating that the PK profile of simoctocog alfa is comparable to that of other 
licensed FVIII products. Additionally, in GENA-01, the bioequivalence of simoctocog alfa and a 
full-length rFVIII could be demonstrated for AUCnorm (AUC normalised to the dose administered) 
in both the CHR and the OS clotting assay.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Simoctocog alfa is the first recombinant human FVIII intended for the treatment of haemophilia 
A that is produced in a human cell line (i.e. HEK 293F). Furthermore no animal derived proteins 
are added throughout the manufacturing process or to the final product. This could potentially 
offer the benefit of fully human PTMs and no foreign protein material in comparison to other 
commercially available FVIII concentrates, which are produced in hamster cell lines (Chinese 
hamster ovary [CHO] and baby hamster kidney [BHK] cells); however, there are no data to 
support such a claim. 
Efficacy in adolescents is based upon a narrow database with a gap for >14 and <18 year old 
patients. In study GENA-03, several patients received prophylactic doses outside the planned 
dose range with the majority of patients receiving doses higher than 45 IU/kg. This was reflected 
in the Product Information and more accurate dose recommendations for the paediatric 
population in the SmPC based on the study results are implemented. 
No data are available for PUPs. A trial investigating the safety and efficacy of simoctocog alfa in 
PUPs is however currently under way (GENA-05). 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The nature and frequency of the reported AEs do not give rise to concern and do not reveal 
unexpected safety signals. As ADRs reported (headache, injection site pain, back pain, vertigo) 
occurred only once, and the database consists of 135 patients, the frequency was reported as 
uncommon. The size of the safety database available at the moment is in compliance with 
guideline requirements. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Due to the rareness of the disease, the safety database is relatively small, although in line with 
guideline requirements. Data on long-term safety will be obtained in the post-marketing phase 
as foreseen by the relevant guideline. 
Clinical trials planned as extension studies to two of the pivotal trials (GENA-11 and GENA-13), 
post-marketing study GENA-99 and the data from a registry (EUHASS) are expected to bring 
more information on the occurrence of AEs of special interest, i.e. development of inhibitors, 
thromboembolic events or hypersensitivity, anaphylactic or allergic reactions and included in the 
pharmacovigilance plan.  
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Available clinical efficacy data for simoctocog alfa support that it is an efficacious new FVIII 
product for the prevention and treatment of BEs in PTPs with haemophilia A.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/279301/2014 
Page 88/90 
 
 
 
  
  
The number of included patients across all clinical trials is in accordance with guideline 
requirements and the safety database is considered sufficient to evaluate the tolerability of 
simoctocog alfa before marketing authorisation. The observed AE profile is considered similar to 
that of other licensed FVIII products. Importantly, no patients developed FVIII inhibitors and no 
thromboembolic events occurred. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, efficacy has been established by the provided clinical data as per the requirements of 
relevant Guidelines. The safety profile of Nuwiq is in line with what is expected.  
The benefit-risk balance in the indication of the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
paediatric and adult patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) is considered 
to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Overall, efficacy of simoctocog alfa in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A covering 
treatment of BEs, prophylaxis of BEs and prophylaxis in surgical procedures is adequately 
supported by submitted clinical data according to the currently valid Clinical Guideline. 
Furthermore, the documented safety profile is within the expected range for FVIII products. 
Studies detailed in the pharmacovigilance plan are expected to update the knowledge on issues 
of special interest in this class (development of inhibitors, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic or 
allergic reactions, safety in previously untreated patients). 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Nuwiq in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
in paediatric and adult patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to 
the following conditions:

4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology: 
One dose of 0.5 mL. 
Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy of Supemtek have not yet been established in individuals below 18 years of age.  
Method of administration: 
For intramuscular injection only. The preferred site is in the deltoid muscle. 
The vaccine must not be injected intravascularly and must not be mixed with other vaccines in the 
same syringe. 
For instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to any trace 
residuals such as octylphenol ethoxylate. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Intercurrent illness 
Vaccination should be postponed in patients with acute febrile illness until the fever is resolved. 
Immunodeficiency 
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be 
insufficient to prevent influenza. 
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders 
As with all injectable vaccines, Supemtek must be administered with caution to individuals with 
thrombocytopaenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular 
administration to these subjects. 
Syncope 
Syncope can occur following or even before any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the 
needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. Procedures should be 
in place to prevent falling and injury and to manage syncope. 
Protection  
As with any vaccine, vaccination with Supemtek may not protect all vaccinees. 
Sodium content 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say is 
essentially “sodium free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed, nor data to assess the concomitant administration of 
Supemtek with other vaccines. 
If Supemtek is to be given at the same time as another injectable vaccine, the vaccines should 
always be administered at different injection sites. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of Supemtek in pregnant women. 
One animal study performed with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo-foetal development or early post-natal 
development. 
An assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before 
administering Supemtek to a pregnant woman. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether Supemtek vaccine is excreted in human milk. 
An assessment of the risks and benefits should be performed by a health care professional before 
administering Supemtek to a breast-feeding woman. 
Fertility 
No human fertility data are available. 
The animal study with trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine did not indicate harmful effects on 
female fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Supemtek has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Supemtek has been administered to and safety data collected from 998 adults 18-49 years of age 
(Study 1) and 4328 adults 50 years of age and older (Study 2).  
The most common reactions occurring after vaccine administration were injection-site reactions 
(tenderness and pain) reported overall by 48% and 37% of study participants 18-49 years of age 
receiving Supemtek respectively. In study participants 50 years of age and older, injection site 
tenderness was reported by 34% and injection site pain reported by 19%. 
The severity of the reactions was mild to moderate. Onset usually occurred within the first 3 days 
after vaccination. All resolved without sequelae.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 
Immunogenicity 
Supemtek was evaluated in healthy adults of 18-49 years of age in a randomized, observer-blind, 
active controlled, non-inferiority immunogenicity, multi-center trial conducted during the 2014-
2015 influenza season in the United States (study 1).  
In the study 1, subjects received Supemtek (N=998) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated 
influenza vaccine (IIV4) (N=332). Immunogenicity was assessed before and 28 days after 
administration of a single dose of study vaccine. 
Haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) were determined for the two 
vaccine groups for each vaccine antigen. Immunogenicity was compared by calculating the 
difference in seroconversion rates (SCR) and the ratios of GMTs of Comparator to Supemtek.  
Study 1 had two co-primary endpoints: GMTs and Day 28 HAI seroconversion rates for each of the 
four antigens contained in the study vaccines.  
Supemtek met the success criterion for GMTs for three of the four antigens but did not meet the 
success criteria for the B/Victoria lineage antigen (Table 2). Antibody titres against the B/Victoria 
were low in both vaccine groups.

The study 1 in adults 18-49 years of age was conducted in parallel to the study 2 in adults of 
50 years of age and older. These adults 18-49 years of age were vaccinated during the same 
influenza season (2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere influenza season) and received the same 
Supemtek formulation (same vaccine strain composition) as adults of 50 years of age and older in 
the study 2. The immune response induced by Supemtek was assessed by the same HAI assay and 
performed by the same laboratory for both studies.  The immunogenicity results in adults 18-49 
years of age (study 1) and adults 50 years of age and older (study 2) are presented in table 4.

These immunogenicity data provide supportive information for the 18-49 years of age group in 
addition to vaccine efficacy data available in adults ≥ 50 years of age (see Clinical Efficacy). 
Clinical efficacy  
Supemtek efficacy in terms of prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness (ILI) 
caused by any strain of influenza, was evaluated in adults ≥ 50 years of age and conducted during 
the 2014-2015 influenza season in the United States (study 2). 
A total of 8963 healthy, medically stable adults were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 
dose of Supemtek (n=4474) or an egg-based quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (n=4489). 
A total of 5412 (60.4%) subjects were 50-64 years of age, 2532 (28.2%) were 65-74 years of age 
and 1019 (11.4 %) were ≥ 75 years of age. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 2 was reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(rtPCR)-positive, protocol-defined ILI due to any strain of influenza. 
Laboratory-confirmed protocol defined ILI was defined as having at least one symptom in each of 
two categories of respiratory and systemic symptoms, which could include sore throat, cough, 
sputum production, wheezing and difficulty breathing, or systemic symptoms such as fever > 99°F 
(>37°C) , chills, fatigue, headache and myalgia, laboratory-confirmed by rtPCR. 
US epidemiological data for the 2014-2015 influenza season indicated that Influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses predominated and that most influenza A/H3N2 viruses were antigenically dissimilar while 
A/H1N1 and B viruses were antigenically similar to vaccine antigens. Supemtek met the pre-
specified success criterion for non-inferiority to the comparator pre-defined as a lower bound of the 
two sided 95% CI >-20%.  
Of the 4474 participants exposed to Supemtek in a phase 3 active-controlled study (Study 2), a total 
of 1761 were 65 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed 
between older and younger participants, the number of patients aged 65 and over in this study was 
not sufficient to determine statistically whether this age group will respond differently from younger 
individuals.

4 Culture of rtPCR-positive samples was performed in MDCK cells. 
5 The lower bound (LB) of the 95% confidence interval met the pre-specified, exploratory criterion for superior relative 
vaccine efficacy, LB > 9%. 
Efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3)  
The efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) is relevant to Supemtek because 
both vaccines are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. 
The efficacy of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine in protecting against influenza illness was 
evaluated in a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial conducted in the 
United States during the 2007-2008 influenza season in adults 18-49 years of age (Study 3). 
Study 3 enrolled and vaccinated 4648 healthy adults randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 
dose of RIV3 (n=2344) or saline placebo (n=2304).  
The primary efficacy endpoint of Study 3 was defined as an influenza-like illness (ILI) with a 
positive culture for an influenza virus strain antigenically resembling a strain represented in RIV3. 
ILI is defined as fever of ≥100°F (37.8°C) oral accompanied by cough, sore throat, or both, on the 
same or consecutive days. Attack rates and vaccine efficacy (VE), defined as the reduction in the 
influenza rate for RIV3 relative to placebo, were calculated for the total vaccinated cohort (n=4648).  
Due to very small number of cultured confirmed influenza cases with matched strains, an 
exploratory analysis of VE of RIV3 against all strains, regardless of antigenic match, isolated from 
any subject with an ILI, not necessarily meeting ILI criteria was done, demonstrated an efficacy 
estimate of 44.8% (95% CI 24.4, 60.0). See Table 6 for VE by case definition.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Supemtek in children from 6 months to 3 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection.  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Supemtek in children from 3 years to 17 years of age for the prevention of influenza infection (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical safety data on the trivalent formulation revealed no special hazard for humans based on 
conventional studies of repeat dose and local toxicity, reproductive and developmental (including 
teratogenicity) toxicity and safety pharmacology studies. The results of these studies with trivalent 
recombinant influenza vaccine are relevant to Supemtek because both vaccines are manufactured 
using the same process and have overlapping compositions.

1.  What Supemtek is and what it is used for  
Supemtek is a vaccine for adults who are 18 years of age and older. This vaccine helps to protect 
you against flu (influenza). Supemtek is egg-free because of the technology used to produce it. 
How Supemtek works 
When a person is given Supemtek, the body’s natural defence (the immune system) produces 
protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can cause flu. 
As with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
When to have a flu vaccine 
Flu can spread very fast.  
• 
It is caused by different types of flu virus that can change every year. This is why you might 
need to be vaccinated every year.  
•  The greatest risk of catching flu is during the cold months between October and March.  
• 
If you were not vaccinated in the autumn, it is still sensible to be vaccinated up until the spring 
since you run the risk of catching flu until then.  
Your doctor will be able to recommend the best time to be vaccinated. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Supemtek 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use Supemtek if you are allergic to :  
• 
• 
the active ingredients or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
octylphenol ethoxylate, a trace residual from the manufacturing process.  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before receiving Supemtek. 
As with all vaccines, Supemtek may not fully protect all persons who are vaccinated. 
Before receiving the vaccine, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have a short-term illness with fever. Vaccination may need to be delayed until your 
fever has gone. 
you have a weakened immune system (immunodeficiency or you are taking medicines that 
affect the immune system such as cancer medicine (chemotherapy) or corticosteroid 
medicines). 
you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
you have fainted with an injection before. Fainting can happen after, or even before an 
injection. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure) talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
receiving Supemtek.  
Other medicines and Supemtek 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines, 
including medicines obtained without a prescription or if you have recently received any other 
vaccine.  
Supemtek may be given at the same time as other vaccines by using separate limbs. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before using this vaccine. Your doctor or pharmacist will help 
you to decide if you should receive Supemtek. 
Driving and using machines 
Supemtek has no or negligible effect on your ability to drive and use machine. 
Supemtek contains sodium   
This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, this means that it’s essentially 
‘sodium free’.  
3.  How Supemtek is given

top of the upper arm (deltoid muscle).

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
VAXELIS (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) is a hexavalent combination vaccine indicated for primary and booster 
vaccination in infants and toddlers for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, 
poliomyelitis caused by poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3, and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus 
influenzae type b. It can be used as a 2- or 3- dose primary series beginning at 6 weeks of age (with an 
interval of at least 1 month between doses), followed by a booster dose, given at least 6 months after the 
primary series. 
VAXELIS was approved in the EU in 2016 and is currently licensed in over 30 countries worldwide.  
VAXELIS is one of the 3 hexavalent paediatric vaccines approved in the EU, together with HEXYON 
(DTaP2-HB-IPV-Hib) and INFANRIX hexa (DTaP3-HBV-IPV/Hib). In clinical practice, switching between 
childhood hexavalent vaccines is sometimes necessary, which results in a “mixed” vaccine schedule. This 
may occur due to changes in vaccine availability, changes in procurement, vaccine shortages, relocation, 
or care provider preference.  
The purpose of the Phase 4 study V419-016 was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity 
of a booster dose of VAXELIS administered to healthy participants approximately 11 to 13 months of age 
who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON 
(Group 2: H,H,V) as part of their routine vaccinations.  
Data of this study could support switching to VAXELIS after a primary series with another hexavalent 
vaccine. The MAH proposed to update sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of VAXELIS with 
respect to the proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs), i.e. with solicited (from Days 1 to 5 
after study vaccination) and unsolicited (from Days 1 to 15 after study vaccination) AEs, and SAEs 
(including fatal SAEs, from Day 1 through completion of study participation i.e. 30 days post-vaccination). 
Body temperatures, concomitant medications, non-study vaccinations, use of any analgesic or antipyretic 
on the day of vaccination were also documented. There were no AEs of special interest in the study, nor 
laboratory evaluation.

The primary and secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the response rates to antigens 
contained in VAXELIS and/or HEXYON 30 days after the booster dose of VAXELIS. Description of the 
antigen-specific GMCs at pre-dose and 30 days post-booster with VAXELIS were amongst the exploratory 
objectives.  
The antibody (Ab) thresholds used as cut-offs for response rates for anti-DT Ab (0.1 IU/ml), anti-TT Ab 
(0.1 IU/ml), anti-poliovirus Ab (1:8 dilution), anti-HBs Ab (10 mIU/ml), anti-PRP Ab (1 µg/mL) are 
consistent with established immunological correlate of protection (ICP). For pertussis, there are currently 
no ICP established. The MAH proposed endpoints based on assay LLOQ for pertussis antigens. Those 
criteria are arbitrary and differ from those previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS and defined in the 
SmPC. However, as the aim of the study is to evidence a booster effect, vaccine response rate defined on 
arbitrary criteria is deemed acceptable as this cannot be avoided in the absence of ICP. In addition, GMCs 
were presented which allowed relevant assessment of the magnitude of the booster effect. 
As of database lock, 168 participants were enrolled in the study. A total of 85 and 82 toddlers were 
administered with a booster dose of VAXELIS respectively in Group 1 (V, V, V) and Group 2 (H, H, V). 
Most of the 167 toddlers who were administered with VAXELIS as a booster at the age of 11 to 13 
months, i.e. at least 6 months post-primary vaccination either with VAXELIS or HEXYON, experienced one 
or more solicited AEs (within 5 days post-vaccination). AEs were generally mild to moderate in intensity. 
Fever was observed in most of the children and was < 40°C for most of them. Unsolicited AEs were 
recorded up to 15 days post-vaccination and a total of 42.4% and 50.0% of the toddlers in Group 1 and 
Group 2 respectively experienced one or more unsolicited AEs related to the study vaccine. A total of 8 
toddlers (9.8%) in Group 2 experienced severe AEs. No severe AEs was recorded in Group 1. No SAE was 
deemed related to the vaccine. 
The boost with VAXELIS elicited specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and/or HEXYON. 
At least 89% of the children had a seroresponse defined as associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, and invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b 
disease. Higher immune responses to pertussis antigens were observed post-boost when compared to 
pre-boost, both in terms of seroresponse and Ab GMCs. 
There are various limitation to the study including the limited sample size, the open-label design and 
absence of participants randomization and stratifications by sex or other characteristics (such as 
concomitant medication or vaccination), which preclude appropriate interpretations of results comparison 
between groups. Number of participants enrolled in each country and in each site were not balanced 
between both groups. Prior and concomitant medications, treatment and vaccines were not balanced 
between groups, which is probably related to the local practices (country and region/site). Additional 
analyses by country and according to the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination are 
overall consistent with the results of the whole PP population in terms of seroresponder rates. Higher 
incidence of solicited systemic AEs was observed in participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the 
day of vaccination versus those who did not. Because of the limited number of toddlers per group, 
interpretation should be cautious and no firm conclusion can be drawn.  
The study was conducted in 3 countries (Germany, Spain and Italy: 13 sites). The recommendation in 
these 3 countries is a 2-dose regimen at 2 and 4 months of age, but other EU countries recommend a 3-
dose regimen. Age recommended for the primary vaccination but also for the booster dose also varies 
depending on EU countries, as well as the hexavalent vaccine to be used for both primary and boost 
vaccinations. These vaccines differ in terms of composition for the pertussis antigens, in terms of 
conjugate for the Haemophilus influenzae type B polysaccharide, and in terms of their respective amount

of some antigens. However, it is considered that the booster effect of VAXELIS will also be observed in 
these different settings. 
The benefit-risk balance of VAXELIS remains positive. There are various limitations to the submitted 
Phase 4 V419-016 study, but it is acknowledged that in clinical practice mixed schedules were and are 
probably used in different EU countries. In addition, the reactogenicity and safety profile of VAXELIS is 
well-known as it has been widely used since 2016. The application is recommended for approval.

5.  Introduction 
VAXELIS (DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib) is a hexavalent combination vaccine indicated for primary and booster 
vaccination in infants and toddlers for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, 
poliomyelitis caused by poliovirus Types 1, 2, and 3, and invasive disease caused by Haemophilus 
influenzae type b. It can be used as a 2- or 3- dose primary series beginning at 6 weeks of age (with an 
interval of at least 1 month between doses), followed by a booster dose, given at least 6 months after the 
primary series. 
VAXELIS was approved in the European Union (EU) in 2016 and is currently licensed in over 30 countries 
worldwide.  
VAXELIS is one of the 3 hexavalent paediatric vaccines approved in the EU, together with HEXYON 
(DTaP2-HB-IPV-Hib) and INFANRIX hexa (DTaP3-HBV-IPV/Hib).  
In clinical practice, switching between childhood hexavalent vaccines is sometimes necessary, which 
results in a “mixed” vaccine schedule. This may occur due to changes in vaccine availability, changes in 
procurement, vaccine shortages, relocation, or care provider preference. 
The purpose of the submitted Phase 4 study V419-016  was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of a booster dose of VAXELIS administered to healthy participants approximately 11 to 
13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series of either VAXELIS (Group 1: 
V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V) as part of their routine vaccinations. 
This application summarizes the safety and immunogenicity of VAXELIS when used as a booster dose in 
children who previously received a 2-dose primary series of VAXELIS or HEXYON from Study V419-016, in 
support of an update to VAXELIS Product Information. There is no proposed change in indication. 
6.  Clinical Immunogenicity aspects 
V419-016 is a Phase 4, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and 
Immunogenicity of VAXELIS in Healthy Children Previously Vaccinated With a 2-Dose Primary Infant 
Series of Either VAXELIS or HEXYON. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
6.1.1.  Study design 
The study was an open-label study of VAXELIS in healthy participants approximately 11 to 13 months of 
age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or 
HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V) at 2 and 4 months of age as part of routine vaccination. A 0.5-mL 
intramuscular dose of VAXELIS was to be administered to all study participants at Visit 1 (Day 1). 
The study was conducted at 13 centers in 3 countries. 
The study design is depicted in Figure 1 below.

Assessor’s comment 
V419-016 is a Phase 4 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
VAXELIS given to toddlers 11 to 13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series 
of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V). 
Data from this study would support switching to VAXELIS after a primary series with another hexavalent 
vaccine. The primary series consisted in 2 doses given 2 months apart. Either VAXELIS or HEXYON was 
given to infants at 2 and 4 months of age as part of their routine vaccination. The boost with VAXELIS, 
open-label, was administered approximately at 11-13 months of age (i.e. at least 6 months post-primary 
vaccination). 
The study was conducted in Germany, Spain and Italy. The 2-dose primary vaccination is recommended 
in those countries from 2 months of age. Refer to section 6.2.3.   
6.1.2.  Study participants

Assessor’s comment 
The Objectives are overall endorsed. 
Please refer to the section 7.1 for the safety endpoints. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints are overall endorsed. Seroprotection or seroconversion rates were 
to be measured at 30 days post-boost. 
The antibody (Ab) thresholds used for anti-DT Ab (0.1 IU/ml), anti-TT Ab (0.1 IU/ml), anti-poliovirus Ab 
(1:8 dilution), anti-HBs Ab (10 mIU/ml) are consistent with established immunological correlate of 
protection.

For diphtheria, it is commonly agreed that a level of 0.01 IU/mL is the lowest level providing some degree 
of protection, and 0.1 IU/mL is considered a protective level of circulating antitoxin. Levels of 1.0 IU/mL 
and greater are associated with long-term protection. 
Similarly, for tetanus, it is generally accepted that levels at 0.01 IU/mL provides considerable protection, 
whereas a level of 0.1 IU/mL corresponds to virtually complete protection against the disease.  
Poliovirus neutralizing antibody levels above the 1 : 8 dilution threshold are correlates of protection 
against clinical paralysis. 
Vaccine-induced protection against HBV infection is defined as having an anti-HBs level of 10 mIU/mL or 
higher, measured 1 to 3 months after receipt of a complete and adequately administered vaccination 
course. 
The threshold used for anti-PRP Ab (1 µg/mL) is the threshold associated with long-term protection. 
Serum anti-PRP Ab levels greater than 0.15 µg/mL are associated with short-term protection whereas 
anti-PRP Ab level required for protection against carriage is greater than 5 µg/mL. The selected threshold 
is endorsed. 
For pertussis, there are currently no immunological correlates of protection that are established. The MAH 
proposed endpoints based on assay LLOQ for pertussis antigens. The vaccine response is defined as 
follows:  
- If pre-vaccination Ab titers are < LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab titers should be ≥4x LLOQ 
- If pre-vaccination Ab titers are ≥ LLOQ but <2x LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab titers should be ≥4x pre-
vaccination values 
- If pre-vaccination Ab titers are ≥ 2x LLOQ, post-vaccination Ab titers should be ≥2x pre-vaccination 
values 
Those criteria are arbitrary and differ from those previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS and defined in 
the SmPC:  
‘Vaccine response: If pre-dose 1 antibody concentration < LLOQ, then post-booster antibody 
concentration should be ≥ LLOQ; If pre-dose 1 antibody concentration ≥ LLOQ, then the post-booster 
antibody concentration should be ≥ pre-dose 1 levels.’ 
The LLOQ of the assay used to measure the pertussis Ab is 2.00 EU/mL for each pertussis Ab, which also 
differ from those previously used (LLOQ = 4 EU/mL are for anti-PT, anti-PRN and anti-FIM; and LLOQ = 3 
EU/mL for anti-FHA). 
Different criteria were also used in the CDP of HEXYON and INFANRIX hexa. 
As the aim of the study is to evidence a booster effect, vaccine response rate defined on arbitrary criteria 
is deemed acceptable as this cannot be avoided in the absence of ICP. In addition, GMCs are presented 
which will allow relevant assessment of the magnitude of the booster effect. 
Please also refer to section 6.1.8 for the description of the assays. 
6.1.5.  Sample size 
This study plan to enrol approximately 160 participants (80 in each group), which will allow estimation of 
the primary immunogenicity endpoints with a reasonable 95% CI.  
This is based on the following assumptions: 1) a 5% non-evaluability rate (76 evaluable participants per 
group), and 2) underlying response rates for VAXELIS following a booster dose based on the study results 
from V419-008 [Silfverdal, S. A., et al 2016].

6.1.6.  Randomization and blinding 
Participants in this study were allocated by non-random assignment. No stratification based on age, sex, 
or other characteristics will be used in this study. 
Blinding was not applicable as this was an open-label study. 
Assessor’s comment 
Participants were not randomized, thus, the participant distribution per country and per site were not 
balanced, which might, in theory, bias the results. However, all participants received VAXELIS as a 
booster dose and no difference in the monitoring of the AEs is expected. In addition, protocol deviations 
were recorded. 
There were no stratifications by age which is acceptable as the age range of the participant to be enrolled 
was clearly defined and narrow (≥327 days to ≤396 days inclusive). There were no stratifications by sex or 
other characteristics (such as concomitant medication or vaccination) although this might have been of 
scientific value. 
The open-label design might bias the reactogenicity/safety results, but this is not considered as a major 
concern as the safety profile of VAXELIS is already well known. 
6.1.7.  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Per-protocol (PP) 
The PP population served as the population for the analysis of immunogenicity data. The PP population 
consists of all enrolled participants without deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the 
results of the immunogenicity endpoint. Potential deviations that may result in the exclusion of a 
participant from the PP population for all immunogenicity analyses include, but are not limited to: 
• 
Failure to receive study vaccine at Visit 1 (Day 1). 
•  Receipt of a prohibited medication or prohibited vaccine within the study window. 
•  Collection of blood sample at Visit 2 outside the prespecified window (Day 26 to Day 40). 
All Participants as Treated (APaT) 
The APaT population consists of all participants who received study vaccination. 
Statistical Methods for Key Immunogenicity Analyses 
No statistical hypothesis testing were performed for immunogenicity analyses. For the immunogenicity 
endpoints, the response rates to each antigen in VAXELIS and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were to be provided, for each group. The CIs were to be calculated based on the exact 
binomial method proposed by Clopper and Pearson. 
Please refer to section 7.1 for the statistical methods for key safety analyses. 
Interim analyses and multiplicity 
No interim analyses are planned. 
No multiplicity adjustment is needed for the primary immunogenicity objective as there is no hypothesis 
testing.

Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses based on receipt of pertussis vaccine during pregnancy by the participant’s biological 
mother (ie, received vs not received) were to be performed for the pertussis immunogenicity endpoints. 
6.1.8.  Immunogenicity assessment 
Sera from participants were used to measure the immune responses to the antigens summarized in Table 
4 and Table 5 using the assays provided below. 
Blood collection, storage, and shipment instructions for serum samples were provided in the 
operations/laboratory manual. 
Anti-Diphtheria Toxoid, Tetanus Toxoid, and Pertussis Antigen Serology Assay 
The Meso Scale Discovery Electrochemiluminescence is a multiplexed serological assay that allows for the 
simultaneous quantification of human antibodies to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis 
antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM). In this assay, each well of a 96-well microtiter plate is precoated in 
precise positions with the 6 different antigens in a multispot fashion. Following incubation with serum 
samples, antigen-specific antibodies bind to the respective antigens. The captured antibodies are then 
detected using a sulfotag conjugated anti-human IgG conjugate. Electrical stimulation of the conjugate in 
the presence of a chemiluminescent substrate results in the generation of a light signal from each specific 
spot that is captured by a camera in relative light units. The signal generated is directly proportional to 
the amount of antibodies present in the sample, which is quantified using software and based on an 
established reference standard sample curve. The LLOQ for diphtheria antibody is 0.005 IU/mL, for 
tetanus antibody is 0.01 IU/mL, and for each pertussis antibody is 2.00 EU/mL. 
Haemophilus Influenzae Type b IgG ELISA 
The Hib IgG ELISA for the in-vitro measurement of specific IgG antibodies against Hib capsular 
polysaccharide in human serum uses the Vacczyme Human Anti-Haemophilus influenzae Type b Enzyme 
Immunoassay Kit purchased from The Binding Site (catalog # MK016), which was further validated for 
use in clinical studies. The kit contains microtiter wells precoated with Hib polysaccharide antigen 
conjugated to human serum albumin. Diluted serum is added to the microtiter wells and allowed to 
incubate. After incubation and washing to remove non-bound serum proteins, HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-
human IgG is added, which binds to any captured Hib-specific IgG molecules. After another wash step, 
tetramethylbenzidine substrate is added; the ensuing color development reaction is then stopped at a 
defined time point by the addition of a dilute acid solution. The OD is measured at 450 nm and is directly 
proportional to the amount of anti-Hib IgG present in the serum specimen. Levels of anti-Hib IgG are 
quantified by interpolation from a standard curve that has been calibrated to the FDA lot 1983 reference 
serum. LLOQ and ULOQ are 0.15 and 5.29 µg/mL. 
Hepatitis B Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECi) Assay 
The purpose of the hepatitis B ECi assay is to detect total antibody to human plasma-derived HBsAg 
subtypes ad and ay before and after vaccination with HBsAg-containing vaccine(s). 
This is the primary assay used to evaluate the serological response to the vaccine(s). The assay is a solid 
phase sandwich enzyme-labeled immunoassay. Results for the assay are reported in mIU/mL. 
This assay involves the reaction of anti-HBs in a test sample with HBsAg coated onto the wells. A HRP-
labeled HBsAg conjugate then forms a complex with the bound anti-HBs, forming an “antigen sandwich”. 
Unbound materials are removed by washing. A reagent that contains luminogenic substrates (a luminol 
derivative and a peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound 
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light. The electron transfer agent 
Type II variation assessment report

Page 16/62 
 
 
 
 
increases the level and duration of the light produced. The amount of HRP conjugate bound and 
subsequent light produced is indicative of the concentration of anti-HBs present in the sample. 
Three internally prepared control serum pools, consisting of a high-positive, low-positive, and negative 
control, are used to monitor the performance of the assay. These pools are each prepared from 4 
individual human immune sera obtained from an external vendor. 
Additionally, there are anti-HBs positive and negative manufacturer-supplied controls, which are prepared 
from freeze-dried recalcified human plasma. The hepatitis B WHO International reference standard at 10 
mIU/mL is also run as a control in every assay. The LLOQ of the assay is 5 mIU/mL. 
Poliovirus Neutralization Assay 
Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 will be measured by neutralization assay. Serial dilutions of sera are 
mixed with challenge poliovirus and incubated with cultured Vero cells that are sensitive to poliovirus. 
Specific neutralizing antibodies contained in the sera bind to and neutralize the challenge poliovirus. The 
neutralized poliovirus does not affect cellular viability, and these cells continue to metabolize and release 
CO2, reducing the pH of the culture medium. Cell survival correlates with the change in the pH indicator 
(phenol red to yellow at pH ≤7.0) contained in the medium. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, the 
challenge poliovirus reduces cellular metabolism and CO2 production. Therefore, the pH does not 
decrease and a color change is not detected. The poliovirus mouse inoculation test measures the 
functional serum antibody response to poliovirus by utilizing Vero cells MEF-1, and Saukett, respectively) 
as the challenge virus. The Karber method is used to determine the serum dilution that neutralized 50% 
of the challenge virus. Results are expressed as titers (1:dilution). The LLOQ for each of the antibodies to 
poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 assays is 1:4. 
Assessor’s comment 
All the assays are validated. The MAH  clarified that, with the exception of the Hepatitis B ECi assay, 
assays were not previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS and provided with main characteristics of the 
assays. 
For Ab values below the LLOQ, the value of 0.5 × LLOQ was used for analysis when calculating GMCs. The 
value of the LLOQ was used for analysis when calculating the GMFR and proportions of participants with a 
≥4-fold rise in antibody level. For values greater than the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ), a value of 
the ULOQ was used for analysis. This is considered acceptable. 
6.2.  Results 
6.2.1.  Participant flow 
The planned enrolment total was 160 participants. As of database lock, 168 participants were enrolled 
across 13 study sites in Germany, Italy, and Spain. All but 1 enrolled participant in Group 1 (V,V,V) 
received VAXELIS at Day 1 and completed the study, and all 82 participants in Group 2 (H,H,V) were 
vaccinated with VAXELIS at Day 1 and completed the study. Three participants were not enrolled (screen 
failures). 
Important protocol deviations were reported for 14 (16.3%) participants in Group 1 (V,V,V), and 15 
(18.3%) participants in Group 2 (H,H,V). Of these, 11 (12.8%) participants in Group 1 (V,V,V) and 13 
(15.9%) participants in Group 2 (H,H,V) had important protocol deviations that were considered to be 
clinically important (The different objectives are listed in Table 6).  
No protocol deviations were classified as a serious GCP compliance issue.

Immunogenicity Analysis Populations 
The primary, secondary, and exploratory immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the PP 
population, defined as all enrolled participants without deviations from the protocol that may have 
substantially affected the results of the immunogenicity endpoints. 
The majority of enrolled participants (Group 1 [V,V,V]: 72 [83.7%], and Group 2 [H,H,V]: 77 [93.9%]) 
were included in the IgG analyses at both Day 1 and Day 30.

Safety Analysis Population 
Safety analyses were performed using the APaT population, defined as all enrolled participants who 
received study intervention. 
Assessor’s comment 
As of database lock, 168 participants were enrolled in the study. A total of 85 and 82 toddlers were 
administered with VAXELIS respectively in Group 1 (V, V, V) and Group 2 (H, H, V). All completed the 
study.  
As mentioned above, the study was conducted in 3 countries. There were 6 sites in Germany, 2 sites in 
Italy and 5 sites in Spain. Number of participants enrolled in each country and in each site were not 
balanced between both groups (Table 14.2-2, study report), which, together with the open-label design 
and the absence of data post-primary vaccination, add limitations to results interpretation (comparison 
between groups). 
Out of the 24 reported protocol deviations considered to be clinically important, the most frequent was 
that the participant blood sample could not be drawn or processed appropriately (n=22), which does not 
impact the safety reporting. One participant was outside the allowed age range at the time of obtaining 
informed consent (327 days to 396 days) and one participant received any prohibited, licensed, live or 
non-live vaccine during the conduct of the study, prior to the visit 2 blood draw.

Safety analyses were performed using the APaT population, defined as all enrolled participants who 
received study intervention, whereas immunogenicity analyses were conducted using the PP population, 
defined as all enrolled participants without deviations from the protocol that may have substantially 
affected the results of the immunogenicity endpoints. The number of participants included in the PP 
population varies by timepoint. A total of 79/86 subjects of Group 1 and 82/82 subjects of Group 2 were 
included in the PP population for the Day 1 timepoint. For Day 30 analyses, 74/86 toddlers of Group 1 
and 77/82 toddlers of Group 2 were included in the PP population. Thus, overall, a higher number of 
participants of Group 1 were excluded when compared to Group 2. The main reasons for exclusion were 
missing serology results and blood draw out of window. 
6.2.2.  Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 31 March 2022 (first participant first visit) and the last subject 
completed on 30 August 2022 (last participant last visit). The database lock date was 24 January 2023.

Medical History  
Reported medical history conditions by System Organ Class (SOC) are presented in Table 14.1-8 of the 
study report. A total of 38.8% and 40.2% of participants of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively had one or 
more conditions.  
Prior and Concomitant Medications/Treatments/Vaccines 
Prior medication (within 30 days prior to vaccination at Day 1) were reported for 58.8% and 29.3% of the 
participants in, respectively, Group 1 and Group 2 (Table 14.1-9 of the study report). Prior non-study 
vaccination (within 14 days prior to vaccination at Day 1) were reported for 3 Group 1-subjects only 
(Table 14.1-10 of the study report). 
Concomitant medications were reported for 80.0% and 64.6% of the participants in Group 1 and Group 2, 
respectively (Table 14.1-11, study report). 
In Group 1, concomitant non-study vaccinations were reported for 80.0% of the participants, and in 
Group 2 concomitant non-study vaccinations were reported for 92.7% of the participants (Table 10).

groups) (all participants as treated population) (Table 14.1-12, study report) 
Assessor’s comment 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the 2 groups.  
There was however a trend for relatively less males in Group 1 (48.2%) than in Group 2 (59.8%). Median 
age at inclusion was similar for both groups (341.0 days). Median age at primary vaccination first dose 
was overall comparable between countries and groups. Medians age range from 63.0 days (Italy, Group 
1) to 74.6 days (Germany, Group 1). Medians age at second vaccination were more variable, ranging 
from 126 days (Spain, Group1) to 150 days (Germany, Group 1).

Except 1 toddler, all were white with a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino in Group 2 (73.2%) when 
compared to Group 1 (52.9%). A total of 77.6% and 80.5% of the mothers included in Group 1 and 
Group 2 respectively had an history of maternal pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. 
As mentioned earlier, the study was conducted in different countries which might have an impact on the 
results. The MAH provided summaries of the proportions of participants meeting specified VAXELIS 
antigen responses at 30 days post-vaccination per country. GMTs were not provided. Overall, the 
immunogenicity results stratified by country are consistent with those of whole PP population. 
Seroresponder rates are comparable for Group 1 (Germany, Italy, Spain) and for Group 2 (Germany, 
Spain) across countries. For the safety results, refer to section 7.2.3. 
Medical history conditions were overall comparable between both groups. There was a trend for higher 
participants reporting with gastrointestinal disorders in Group 2 (13.4%, n=11/82) versus Group 1 
(7.1%,n= 6/85). The most frequently reported medical history conditions were all comprised in the SOC 
infections and infestations’ and were, in Group 1, nasopharyngitis (11.8%, n=10/85), upper respiratory 
tract infection (10.6%, n=9/85), and gastroenteritis (7.1%, n=6/85). The most frequently reported 
medical history conditions in Group 2 were upper respiratory tract infection (18.3%, n=15/82), 
conjunctivitis (12.2%, n=10/82), and bronchiolitis (8.5%, n=7/82). 
Prior and concomitant medications, treatment and vaccines are not balanced between groups, which is 
probably related to the local practices (country and region/site). 
Proportions of participants (treated population, Table 14.1-9 of the study report) with specific prior 
medications (within 30 days prior administration of VAXELIS) were 58.8% (n=50/85) in Group 1 and 
29.3% (24/82) in Group 2. Main differences between groups were for the following medication categories 
(difference ≥ 5%): stomatological preparations (8.2% vs 1.2%), vitamins (47.1% vs 23.2%), nasal 
preparations (9.4% vs 2.4%), and ophthalmologicals (11.8% vs 4.9%). 
It is not known whether prior medications could have an impact on the reactogenicity/safety and 
immunogenicity of the booster administration. This is a limitation of the study but it is acknowledged that 
study design would not allow to address this aspect.  
Proportions of participants (treated population, Table 14.1-11 of the study report) with specific 
concomitant medications were 80.0% (n=68/85) in Group 1 and 64.6% (n=53/82) in Group 2. Main 
differences were for the following medication categories (difference ≥ 5%): stomatological preparations 
(14.1% vs 2.4%), vitamins (47.1% vs 23.2%), anti-acne preparations (15.3% vs 9.8%), other 
dermatological preparations (16.5% vs 11.0%), other gynecologicals (15.3% vs 9.8%), urologicals (8.2% 
vs 2.4%), analgesics (45.9% vs 51.2%), nasal preparations (9.4% vs 2.4%), throat preparations (15.3% 
vs 9.8%) and otologicals (9.4% vs 2.4%). 
As for prior medications, it is not known whether concomitant medications could have an impact on the 
reactogenicity/safety and immunogenicity of the booster administration. This is a limitation of the study 
but it is acknowledged that study design would not allow to address this aspect.  
Proportions of participants (treated population, Table 10) with specific concomitant vaccinations were 
80.0% (n=68/85) in Group 1 and 92.7% (n=76/82) in Group 2. MMR vaccines were administered in 
44.7% of the toddlers in Group 1 versus 53.7% of toddlers included in Group 2. The MMR vaccine 
administered was always the same in Group 2, whereas 3 different vaccine types were administered in 
Group 1. A total of 43.5% and 54.9% of the toddlers of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively received a 
meningococcal vaccine (all except 2 subjects received the A/C/W/Y conjugated vaccine) and a total of

77.6% and 92.6% of the toddlers of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively received a conjugated 
pneumococcal vaccine (PPV13 for the majority of them). 
As indicated in the SmPC, section 4.5, VAXELIS may be administered simultaneously with pneumococcal 
polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, rotavirus vaccines, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and varicella 
containing vaccines and meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. 
Overall, all these differences between groups limit the result interpretation.

Assessor’s comment 
Specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and HEXYON were observed at 30 days post-
boost. 
At Day 1 (pre-vaccination), proportion of participants showing Ab titers equal or above the Ab thresholds 
associated with protection against diphtheria, tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses and hepatitis 
B were overall comparable between groups, with 95% CIs overlapping (Table 24). In contrast, anti-PRP 
Ab levels were not comparable between groups. Only 1 out of 81 participant of Group 2 (H,H,V) had anti-
PRP Ab levels equal or above the threshold associated with long-term protection, versus 51/79 (64.6%) 
of Group 1 (Table 24). Proportion of participants who achieved short term protective concentration of anti 
Hib-PRP ≥0.15 µg/mL was calculated (Table 25). Although the percentages of participants with Ab levels ≥
0.15 µg/mL was higher than those with Ab levels ≥1.0 µg/mL, the percentage observed in Group 2 was 
still lower than the percentage observed in Group 1 (27.2% [22/81] versus 87.3% [69/79]), indicating 
the importance of the booster dose. Proportion of responders at Day 1 (pre-vaccination) were not 
presented for the pertussis antigens PT and FHA because of no Ab threshold associated with protection. 
GMTs specific for PT and FHA at Day 1 were presented at initial submission, which is deemed sufficient. 
More than 98% of the participants of both groups reach the Ab threshold associated with protection 
against diphtheria and tetanus. Only 1 toddler from Group 2 did not mount Ab levels ≥0.1 IU/mL to 
diphtheria toxoid, and one toddler to tetanus toxoid. It is not known if it is the same child. More than 
95% are considered protected against clinical paralysis due to polioviruses based on results of the 
different poliovirus neutralization assays. Three subjects of Group 2 had anti-poliovirus 1 Ab titers and 2 
subjects of Group 1 had anti-poliovirus 3 Ab titers below the defined thresholds. The vast majority 
(>89%) of the participants had anti-PRP Ab levels equal or above the threshold associated with long-term 
protection (65/73 and 69/76 in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively). Anti-HBs Ab levels were ≥ 10 mIU/mL 
(associated with vaccine-induced protection) in more than 94% of the participants, corresponding to 4/69 
toddlers of Group 2 with an Ab level below the threshold of 10 mIU/mL. 
Percentages of participants reaching the Ab threshold associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, hepatitis B and long-term protection against Haemophilus 
Influenzae Type b at 1 month post-vaccination were always higher than at Day 1 (pre-vaccination). 
Vaccine response rates were >90% for common pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) in both groups. As 
expected, vaccine response rates were lower in Group 2 for PRN and FIM 2/3, both antigens being only 
contained in VAXELIS. Seroresponse rate for PRN in Group 2 was very low (22.5%). 
Participant’s legally acceptable representative were to document on the VRC the use of any analgesic or 
antipyretic on the day of vaccination.  A total of 55 participants used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination, n= 27/85 (32%) in Group 1 and n=28/82 (34%) in Group 2. No other analgesic/antipyretic, 
or immunosuppressant medication, than paracetamol or ibuprofen were reported on the day of 
vaccination.  
In terms of percentages of participants achieving thresholds associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, hepatitis B and long-term protection against Haemophilus 
Influenzae Type b, no differences were observed between participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on 
the day of vaccination and those who did not. Results were overall consistent with those of whole PP 
population.

Assessor’s comment 
Pre-boost (Visit 1), Ab-specific GMCs for DT, TT, PT, HBsAg and Polioviruses 1-3 were comparable 
between groups. 
Higher anti-PRP Ab GMC was observed in Group 1 (1.25, 95% CI of 0.92-1.70) when compared to Group 
2 (0.11, 95%CI of 0.10-0.13). Anti-PRP Ab GMC of Group 2 were lower than the LLOQ (0.15 µg/mL).  
Type II variation assessment report

Page 26/62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Specific Ab GMCs to FHA and to FIM 2/3 were respectively higher and lower in Group 2 when compared to 
Group 1 (FHA-Ab titers of 29.52 vs 8.39 and FIM 2/3-Ab titers of 1.21 vs 18.01 in Group 1 and Group 2 
respectively, 95% CI non-overlapping). PRN-Ab were low in both groups (2.68 and 1.39 for Group 1 and 
Group 2 respectively). FIM 2/3-Ab and PRN Ab titers of Group 2 were lower than the LLOQ (2.00 EU/mL). 
Responses post-primary vaccination are not known, no conclusion can thus be drawn on the kinetics of 
the persistence of the immune response following primary vaccination with VAXELIS or HEXYON. Maternal 
immunisation could also have an impact on the (memory) responses. 
At 30 days post-boost with VAXELIS specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and HEXYON 
were observed. Higher Ab GMCs were observed for DT, TT, PT, FIM 2/3, PRN and HBsAg in Group 1 when 
compared to Group 2. FIM 2/3 and PRN Ab titers remain low in Group 2 as expected since the infants 
were not primed with these antigens. 
Higher FHA-Ab titers were observed in Group 2 when compared to Group 1, as observed pre-boost.  
Ab titers specific to Hib-PRP and the 3 polioviruses were overall comparable between groups. 
Observation were confirmed by reverse cumulative distribution curves (Figures 14.2-1 to 14.2-11 of the 
study report). 
No conclusion can be drawn on these group comparisons as the study was open-label, non-randomized, 
conducted in 3 different countries (and 13 sites), with/without previous medication, and with/without 
concomitant administration of medication and/or vaccines. Subgroup analyses were not presented 
according to all these variables. 
Stratified descriptive immunogenicity data for participants with/without use of analgesic/antipyretic on 
the day of vaccination in terms of GMCs were provided. As mentioned above, a total of 55 participants 
used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination. However, GMC Ab responses are not available for all 
the participants, resulting in limited number of participants per group. Ab GMC results were overall 
consistent with those of whole PP population. 
Subgroup analysis of the vaccine responses to pertussis antigens according to pertussis maternal 
immunisation during the pregnancy was also presented (Tables 14.2-3 and 14.2-4 of study report). No 
data pre-boost were provided. GMCs post-primary vaccination, pre- and post-boost were neither 
provided. Only 11 infants in each group were born from mothers not vaccinated during their pregnancies, 
which also preclude appropriate comparison.  
The only conclusion that can be drawn is that maternal immunisation with pertussis antigen does not 
seem to interfere with a booster vaccination with VAXELIS, hence adequate memory induced by the 
primary vaccination, either with VAXELIS or HEXYON.  
6.3.  Discussion 
Methods 
V419-016 is a Phase 4 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
VAXELIS given to toddlers 11 to 13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series 
of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V). 
Data of this study would support switching to VAXELIS after a primary series with another hexavalent 
vaccine. The primary series consisted in 2 doses given 2 months apart. Either VAXELIS or HEXYON was 
given to infants at 2 and 4 months of age as part of their routine vaccination. The boost with VAXELIS, 
open-label, was administered approximately at 11-13 months of age (i.e. at least 6 months post-primary 
vaccination). 
Type II variation assessment report

The study was conducted in Germany, Spain and Italy. The 2-dose primary vaccination is recommended 
in those countries at 2 and 4 months of age, and the boost is recommended at 11 months.  
The primary immunogenicity objective was to describe the response rates to antigens contained in both 
VAXELIS and HEXYON 30 days after the booster dose of VAXELIS. The secondary objective was to 
describe the response rates to antigens contained in both VAXELIS, but not in HEXYON, 30 days after the 
booster dose of VAXELIS. Description of the antigen-specific GMCs at pre-dose and 30 days post-booster 
with VAXELIS were amongst the exploratory objectives. The Objectives are overall endorsed. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints are overall endorsed. Seroprotection or seroconversion rates were 
to be measured at 30 days post-boost. The antibody (Ab) thresholds used for anti-DT Ab (0.1 IU/ml), 
anti-TT Ab (0.1 IU/ml), anti-poliovirus Ab (1:8 dilution), anti-HBs Ab (10 mIU/ml), anti-PRP Ab (1 µg/mL) 
are consistent with established immunological correlate of protection (ICP). For pertussis, there are 
currently no ICP that are established. The MAH proposed endpoints based on assay LLOQ for pertussis 
antigens. Those criteria are arbitrary and differ from those previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS and 
defined in the SmPC. However, as the aim of the study is to evidence a booster effect, vaccine response 
rate defined on arbitrary criteria is deemed acceptable as this cannot be avoided in the absence of ICP. In 
addition, GMCs are presented which will allow relevant assessment of the magnitude of the booster 
effect. 
This study planned to enrol approximately 160 participants (80 in each group). Participants were not 
randomized, thus, the participant distribution per country and per site was not balanced, which might, in 
theory, bias the results. There was no stratification by age which is acceptable as the age range of the 
participants to be enrolled was clearly defined and narrow (≥327 days to ≤396 days inclusive). There was 
no stratifications by sex or other characteristics (such as concomitant medication or vaccination) although 
this might have been of scientific value. 
The PP population served as the population for the analysis of immunogenicity data. The PP population 
consists of all enrolled participants without deviations from the protocol that may substantially affect the 
results of the immunogenicity endpoint. No statistical hypothesis testing were performed for 
immunogenicity analyses. 
The different immunogenicity assays used are validated assays. With the exception of the Hepatitis B ECi 
assay, these assays were not previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS. Main characteristics of the assays 
are provided. 
Results 
Participants and baseline data 
As of database lock, 168 participants were enrolled in the study. A total of 85 and 82 toddlers were 
administered with VAXELIS respectively in Group 1 (V, V, V) and Group 2 (H, H, V). All completed the 
study. All participants included in Italy received a VAXELIS primary series (Group 1). Number of 
participants in this country is limited (n=11). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the 2 groups. There was 
however a trend for relatively less males in Group 1 (48.2%) as compared to Group 2 (59.8%). Median 
age was similar for both groups (341.0 days). Except for 1 toddler, all were white with a higher 
proportion of Hispanic/Latino in Group 2 (73.2%) when compared to Group 1 (52.9%). A total of 77.6% 
and 80.5% of the mothers included in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively, had an history of maternal 
pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. 
Proportions of participants with specific prior or concomitant medications or vaccinations were different 
between groups. It is not known whether prior or concomitant medications could have an impact on the 
reactogenicity/safety and immunogenicity of the booster administration, this is a limitation of the study.

Stratified descriptive data for participants with/without use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination, both for reactogenicity (solicited local and systemic adverse events) and for immunogenicity 
were nevertheless submitted (see below). 
Immunogenicity results 
VAXELIS elicited specific Ab to each antigens contained in both VAXELIS and HEXYON. 
At 30 days post-boost with VAXELIS, more than 98% of the participants of both groups reach the Ab 
threshold associated with protection against diphtheria and tetanus. More than 95% are considered 
protected against clinical paralysis due to polioviruses based on results of the different poliovirus 
neutralization assays. The vast majority (>89%) of the participants had anti-PRP Ab levels equal or above 
the threshold associated with long-term protection. Anti-HBs Ab levels were ≥ 10 mIU/mL (associated 
with vaccine-induced protection) in more than 94% of the participants. Vaccine response rates were 
>90% for common pertussis antigens (PT and FHA) in both groups. As expected, vaccine response rates 
were lower in Group 2 for PRN and FIM 2/3, both antigens being only contained in VAXELIS.  
Percentages of participants reaching the Ab threshold associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, hepatitis B and long-term protection against Haemophilus 
Influenzae type b at 1 month post-vaccination were always higher than at Day 1 (pre-vaccination), 
indicating the usefulness of a booster dose. 
At 30 days post-boost with VAXELIS, higher Ab GMCs were observed for DT, TT, PT, FIM 2/3, PRN and 
HBsAg in Group 1 when compared to Group 2. FIM 2/3 and PRN Ab titers remain low in Group 2 as 
expected since the infants were not primed with these antigens. Higher FHA-Ab titers were observed in 
Group 2 when compared to Group 1, as observed pre-boost. Ab titers specific to Hib-PRP and the 3 
polioviruses were overall comparable between groups.  
No conclusion can be drawn on these group comparisons as the study was open-label, non-randomized, 
conducted in 3 different countries (and 13 sites), with/without previous medication, and with/without 
concomitant administration of medication and/or vaccines. Subgroup analyses were not presented 
according to all these variables. Although, as per study design, no robust interpretation could be done, 
immunogenicity results stratified by country or for participants with/without use of analgesic/antipyretic 
on the day of vaccination were shown to be overall consistent with those of whole PP population 
(seroprotection rates). 
 Subgroup analysis  of the vaccine responses to pertussis antigens according to pertussis maternal 
immunisation during the pregnancy were also presented. Results suggest that maternal immunisation 
with pertussis antigen does not interfere with a booster vaccination with VAXELIS, hence adequate 
memory seems to be induced by the primary vaccination, either with VAXELIS or HEXYON. 
Conclusion 
A boost with VAXELIS given at least 6 months after primary vaccination with 2 doses of either VAXELIS or 
HEXYON elicited specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and/or HEXYON. 
At least 89% of the children had a seroresponse defined as associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, and invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b 
disease. Percentages of participants reaching these seroresponses at 1 month post-vaccination were 
always higher than at Day 1 (pre-vaccination). 
Higher immune responses to pertussis antigens were observed post-boost when compared to pre-boost, 
both in terms of seroresponse and Ab GMCs. 
Because of the various limitations of the study, results comparison between groups cannot be 
appropriately interpreted.

7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
V419-016, a Phase 4, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
VAXELIS (V419) given as a booster to healthy participants approximately 11 to 13 months of age who 
previously received a 2-dose primary infant series of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 
2: H,H,V). 
The primary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a booster dose of VAXELIS with 
respect to the proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). 
The safety endpoints include: 
•  Number of participants with solicited injection-site AEs from Day 1 through Day 5 post-vaccination 
with VAXELIS. 
•  Number of participants with solicited systemic AEs from Day 1 through Day 5 post-vaccination with 
VAXELIS. 
•  Number of participants with unsolicited AEs from Day 1 through Day 15 post-vaccination with 
VAXELIS. 
•  Number of participants with an SAE, a vaccine-related SAE, discontinuation due to an AE, and death, 
from Day 1 through completion of study participation. 
• 
Participants body temperature measured from Day 1 through Day 5 post-vaccination with VAXELIS. 
Body temperatures, solicited and unsolicited AEs, concomitant medications, non-study vaccinations, use 
of any analgesic or antipyretic on the day of vaccination were documented by the participant’s legally 
acceptable representative by using a paper vaccination report card (VRC). 
Solicited AEs for this study are summarized in Table 13. All solicited injection-site AEs are considered 
related to study intervention. 
Table 13. Solicited Adverse events (Table 6, Protocol) 
Unsolicited AEs for this study are events that are 1) not predefined in Table 13 or 2) predefined in Table 
13, but reported at any time outside the solicited time period. The investigator assessed unsolicited AEs 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE with respect to seriousness, intensity, and causality.

Safety analyses were performed using the APaT population, defined as all enrolled participants who 
received study intervention. At least 1 temperature measurement obtained after study intervention was 
required for inclusion in the analyses of temperature. 
Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of AEs and post-vaccination temperatures. The 
overall safety endpoints and specific AEs were summarized by providing the number and percentage of 
participants with AEs. The 95% within-group CIs for the percentages of participants with the event were 
provided. Within-group CIs were calculated based on the exact binomial method proposed by Clopper and 
Pearson. 
Table 14. Analysis strategy for safety parameters (Table 7, Protocol) 
There were no safety topics of special interest.  
There were no laboratory safety evaluations required by the protocol. 
If the underlying incidence of an SAE is 1.00% (1 of every 100 participants receiving the vaccine), there 
is an 80% chance of observing at least 1 SAE among 160 participants. If the underlying incidence of an 
SAE is 0.43% (1 of every 231 participants receiving the vaccine), there is a 50% chance of observing at 
least 1 SAE among 160 participants. If no SAEs are observed among the 160 participants, this study 
provides 95% confidence that the underlying percentage of participants with SAE is <1.85% (1 in every 
53 participants). 
The extent of exposure was summarized by the number and proportion of participants vaccinated with 
VAXELIS. 
Assessor’s comment 
V419-016 is a Phase 4 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
VAXELIS given to toddlers 11 to 13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series 
of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V). 
Reactogenicity and safety assessments included monitoring and recording of solicited and unsolicited AEs, 
SAEs (including fatal SAEs). Body temperatures, concomitant medications, non-study vaccinations, use of 
any analgesic or antipyretic on the day of vaccination were also documented.

Solicited AEs were evaluated from Days 1 to 5 after study vaccination. Solicited local AEs included 
swelling, redness (erythema), or pain (tenderness). All solicited injection-site AEs were considered related 
to study intervention. 
Solicited systemic AEs included vomiting, drowsiness (somnolence), appetite lost, and irritability. The 
causality of solicited systemic AEs was assessed by the investigators. 
The number of solicited AEs to be monitor were limited. However, VAXELIS is widely used with a well-
known reactogenicity/safety profile. 
Unsolicited AEs were evaluated from Days 1 to 15 after study vaccination. Those are AEs defined as a 
solicited AE but with an onset of more than 5 days following vaccination or are AEs with an onset within 
15 days following vaccination that are not defined as a solicited AE. 
The investigators used their clinical judgment to assess the causal relatedness and the intensity/size of an 
AE or SAE. 
Occurrence of SAEs, discontinuation due to an AE and death were reported from Day 1 through 
completion of study participation (i.e. 30 days post-vaccination). There were no AEs of special interest in 
the study, nor laboratory evaluation. 
Analyses were performed in the APaT population which consisted of all randomized participants who 
received study vaccination. 
Safety methods and endpoints are overall endorsed.

A trend for a higher proportion of participants with one or more adverse events was observed for Group 1 
when compared for Group 2, but still with 95% CI overlapping. All except 1 systemic AE were considered 
by the investigator as related to the vaccine. No vaccine-related SAEs, deaths, or discontinuations due to 
AEs were reported in the study.

Table 18. Summary of maximum temperature by Brighton collaboration cut points (all participants as

Assessor’s comment 
Most toddlers experienced one or more solicited AEs (96.5% in Group 1 and 86.6% in Group 2). Overall, 
a trend for higher proportions of toddlers experiencing one or more solicited injection site and solicited 
systemic AEs was observed in Group 1 when compared to Group 2. 95% CI were not overlapping for the 
solicited systemic AEs. These differences in percentages might be explained by the limited sample size 
but also by country-biased, differences in prior and concomitant medications or vaccinations. 
Overall, the solicited AEs results stratified by country are consistent with those of whole PP population. 
Percentage of solicited injection site AEs observed in Group 1 tends to be higher in Spain (93.2%, 95% 
CI: 81.3-98.6) when compared to those of Germany (73.3%, 95% CI: 54.1-87.7) and Italy (72.7%, 95% 
CI: 39.0-94.0). For solicited systemics AEs, percentage observed in Group 1 in Italy (63.6%, 95% CI: 
30.8-89.1) is lower than those of both other countries (Spain: 95.5%, 95% I: 84.5-99.4; Germany: 
96.7%, 95% 82.8-99.9) but the number of participants in Italy is too limited to draw definitive conclusion 
(n=11). 
A total of 55 participants used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, n= 27/85 (32%) in Group 
1 and n=28/82 (34%) in Group 2. No other analgesic/antipyretic, or immunosuppressant medication, 
than paracetamol or ibuprofen were reported on the day of vaccination.  
Solicited systemic AEs were reported in all Group 1 participants and in 23/28 (82.1) of the Group 2 
participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, which is higher than the 
Type II variation assessment report

percentages observed in participants who did not (87.9% and 63.0 % in Group 1 and in Group 2, 
respectively). A trend for higher percentage of Group 2 participants experiencing solicited injection site 
AEs was also observed in participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination (82.1%) 
versus those who did not (72.2%). In Group 1, the percentage of participants experiencing solicited 
injection site AEs was similar in participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination 
(85.2%) versus those who did not (82.8%). 
Because the limited sample size per group, interpretation should be cautious and no firm conclusion can 
be drawn. 
The most frequently reported solicited injection-site AE was injection-site pain, with a trend for a higher 
proportion of participants with this AE in Group 1 (74.1%) vs Group 2 (56.1%). Irritability was the most 
frequently reported solicited systemic AEs (77.6% in Group 1 vs 58.5% in Group 2). 
All solicited injection-site AEs were considered related to VAXELIS administration as per protocol. Most of 
the solicited systemic AEs were also considered vaccine-related by the investigator. 
A total of 80 and 66 participants of Group 1 and Group 2 respectively had one or more solicited AEs 
graded by intensity (Table 12-4, Study report). Of those 40.0% and 39.0% were considered as mild, 
47.1% (n=40/85) and 28.0% (n=23/82) as moderate and 7.1% (n=6/85) and 13.4% (n=11/82) as 
severe in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. 
Solicited injection-site erythema or swelling were also categorized by size (Table 12-5, Study report). 
Most of the injection-site erythema AEs were ≤1 inch (34/45 for Group 1 and 28/41 for Group 2). 4/45 
and 9/41 were between 1 and ≤2, 7/45 and 3/41 between 2 and ≤3, and 0/45 and 1/41 between 3 and 
≤4, for Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. The same trend was observed for the solicited injection-site 
swelling. 
Fever was collected from Day 1 to Day 5 post-vaccination. Fever ≥38°C was observed in 81.2% and 
71.6% of Group 1 and Group 2 subjects respectively. Fever ≥39°C was observed in 24.7% and 23.2% of 
Group 1 and Group 2 subjects respectively. Fever ≥40°C was measured in 3.5% and 4.8% of the 
subjects respectively included in Group 1 and Group 2.

Assessor’s comment 
A total of 44/85 (51.8%) and 52/82 (63.4%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited AEs. Percentages of unsolicited AEs per SOC were overall 
comparable except for the SOC General disorder and administration site conditions with a trend for higher 
percentages in Group 2 (53.7%) when compared to Group 1 (42.4%). There were 6/44 (7.3%) of the 
Group 2 participants who experienced induration at the site of injection versus 0 in Group 1. Although no 
difference of percentages between groups for the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders was observed, higher 
number of toddlers experienced diarrhoea in Group 2 (7.3%: 6/10) when compared to Group 1 (1.2%: 
1/9). 
A total of 36/85 (42.4%) and 41/82 (50.0%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited AEs related to the study vaccine. The main difference was the 7.3% 
of the Group 2 participants who experienced induration at the site of injection versus 0 in Group 1. 
Among the toddlers who experienced one or more unsolicited AEs, a higher percentage of toddlers in 
Group 2 versus Group 1 experienced severe AEs: 9.8% (8 severe AEs: 6 pyrexia, 1 nausea, 1 urticaria) 
vs 0%, respectively. 
7.2.5.  Serious adverse events and fatal serious adverse events 
One SAE of adenovirus gastroenteritis was reported for 1 participant in Group 2 and was considered by 
the investigator to be not related to study intervention. 
There were no deaths due to AEs reported in this study.

Assessor’s comment 
One SAE of adenovirus gastroenteritis was reported for 1 participant in Group 2. 
On Day 8 the participant experienced weight loss, vomiting, and diarrhoea and was admitted to the 
hospital. The participant was diagnosed with adenovirus gastroenteritis (moderate, onset on Day 3) and 
treated with IV fluid supplements. On Day 15 adenovirus gastroenteritis was considered resolved. 
The event was considered by the investigator to be not related to study intervention. 
On Day 37, the last known date, the participant completed the study. 
7.2.6.  Post-marketing experience 
VAXELIS was approved in the EU via Centralized Procedure on 15-FEB-2016 (including the UK), in the US 
on 21-DEC-2018, in Switzerland on 28-AUG-2019, and in Australia on 22-MAR-2022. A separate Great 
Britain registration was grandfathered in post-Brexit on 01-JAN-2021. VAXELIS is currently registered and 
approved in over 30 countries worldwide. 
The estimated number of marketed VAXELIS doses distributed worldwide since market introduction (15-
FEB-2016 to 28-FEB-2023) was approximately 14,306,679. Patient exposure estimates were calculated 
from the Company’s internal distribution data from the Worldwide Financial Reporting System and the 
Financial Sharing Area database. Patient exposure estimates were calculated from expanded distribution 
categories to provide a more accurate estimate of patient exposure worldwide. 
Cumulatively, approximately 3,576,669 to 14,306,679 individuals are estimated to have been exposed to 
the vaccine, based on the assumption that each individual received 1 to 4 doses depending on country-
specific vaccination schedules (2 + 1 or 3 + 1 schedule) and that all the distributed doses were 
administered. 
The EU Summary of Product Characteristics was updated in FEB-2020 to include “Hypotonic-
hyporesponsive episode” to the list of post-marketing AEs, based on a cumulative assessment of post-
marketing data from the Marketing Authorisation Holder global safety database. 
In DEC-2021, the EU Summary of Product Characteristics was updated to include “convulsions with or 
without fever” to the list of Other Side Effects, and on 26-JAN-2023 to add “Hypersensitivity” including 
“Anaphylactic reactions” to the list of adverse drug reactions with a frequency of “Rare”. 
No important identified risks, important potential risks, or missing information were associated with 
VAXELIS as described in the current EU Risk Management Plan (Version 3.1, dated 25-FEB-2020). Based 
on a review of post-marketing data available as of 13-FEB-2023, no new safety issues were identified 
from this review. The Applicant will continue to monitor the safety of VAXELIS through routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
7.3.  Discussion 
V419-016 is a Phase 4 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a booster dose of 
VAXELIS given to toddlers 11 to 13 months of age who previously received a 2-dose primary infant series 
of either VAXELIS (Group 1: V,V,V) or HEXYON (Group 2: H,H,V). 
Reactogenicity and safety assessments included monitoring and recording of solicited and unsolicited AEs, 
and SAEs (including fatal SAEs). Body temperatures, concomitant medications, non-study vaccinations, 
use of any analgesic or antipyretic on the day of vaccination were also documented. There were no AEs of 
special interest in the study, nor laboratory evaluation.

Analyses were performed in the APaT population which consisted of all randomized participants who 
received study vaccination. 
Safety methods and endpoints are overall endorsed. 
Exposure 
As of database lock, 168 participants were enrolled. A total of 85 and 82 toddlers were administered with 
VAXELIS (open-label) respectively in Group 1 (V, V, V) and Group 2 (H, H, V). 
Main demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between the 2 groups.  
Prior and concomitant medications, treatment and vaccines were not balanced between groups, which is 
probably related to the local practices (country and region/site). Indeed, the study was conducted in 3 
countries, 13 sites. Number of participants enrolled in each country and in each site were not balanced 
between both groups, which, together with the open-label design, add limitations to results interpretation 
(comparison between groups). 
Solicited AEs 
Solicited AEs were evaluated from Days 1 to 5 after study vaccination. Solicited local AEs included 
swelling, redness, and pain. Solicited systemic AEs included vomiting, drowsiness, appetite lost, and 
irritability. The number of solicited AEs to be monitor were limited. However, VAXELIS is widely used with 
a well-known reactogenicity/safety profile. 
Most toddlers experienced one or more solicited AEs (96.5% in Group 1 and 86.6% in Group 2). Overall, 
a trend for higher proportions of toddlers experiencing one of more solicited injection site and solicited 
systemic AEs was observed in Group 1 when compared to Group 2. 95% CI were not overlapping for the 
solicited systemic AEs. These differences in percentages might be explained by the limited sample size 
but also by country-biased, differences in prior and concomitant medications or vaccinations.  
The most frequently reported solicited injection-site AE was injection-site pain, with a trend for a higher 
proportion of participants with this AE in Group 1 (74.1%) vs Group 2 (56.1%). Irritability was the most 
frequently reported solicited systemic AEs (77.6% in Group 1 vs 58.5% in Group 2). 
All solicited injection-site AEs were considered related to VAXELIS administration as per protocol. Most of 
the solicited systemic AEs were also considered vaccine-related by the investigator. 
Most of the solicited AEs were of mild to moderate intensity (92.5% and 83.3% of the AEs graded by 
intensity in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively). Solicited injection-site erythema or swelling were also 
categorized by size, and most of them were ≤ 1 inch. 
Fever was collected from Day 1 to Day 5 post-vaccination. Fever ≥38°C was observed in 81.2% and 
71.6% of Group 1 and Group 2 subjects respectively. Fever ≥40°C was measured in 3.5% and 4.8% of 
the subjects respectively included in Group 1 and Group 2. 
Unsolicited AEs 
Unsolicited AEs were evaluated from Days 1 to 15 after study vaccination. Those are AEs defined as a 
solicited AE but with an onset of more than 5 days following vaccination or are AEs with an onset within 
15 days following vaccination that are not defined as a solicited AE. 
A total of 44/85 (51.8%) and 52/82 (63.4%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited AEs. A total of 36/85 (42.4%) and 41/82 (50.0%) of the toddlers in 
Group 1 and Group 2 respectively experienced one or more unsolicited AEs related to the study vaccine. 
The main difference was the 7.3% of the Group 2 participants who experienced induration at the site of 
injection versus 0 in Group 1.

Among the toddlers who experienced one or more unsolicited AEs, a higher percentage of toddlers in 
Group 2 versus Group 1 experienced severe AEs: 9.8% (8 severe AEs: 6 pyrexia, 1 nausea, 1 urticaria) 
vs 0%, respectively. . 
SAEs and fatal SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from the study 
Occurrence of SAEs, discontinuation due to an AE and death were reported from Day 1 through 
completion of study participation (i.e. 30 days post-vaccination).  
One SAE of adenovirus gastroenteritis was reported for 1 participant in Group 2. The event was 
considered by the investigator to be not related to study intervention. 
There were no deaths due to AEs reported in this study. There were no discontinuations due to an AE 
reported in this study. 
Conclusion 
The reactogenicity and safety profile of VAXELIS is well-known as it has been widely used since 2016. 
In study V419-016, most of the 167 toddlers who were administered with VAXELIS as a booster at the 
age of 11 to 13 months, i.e. at least 6 months post-primary vaccination either with VAXELIS or HEXYON, 
experienced one or more solicited AEs (within 5 days post-vaccination). AEs were generally mild to 
moderate intensity. Fever was observed in most of the children and was < 40°C for most of them. 
Unsolicited AEs were recorded up to 15 days post-vaccination and a total of 36/85 (42.4%) and 41/82 
(50.0%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively experienced one or more unsolicited AEs 
related to the study vaccine. A total of 8 toddlers (9.8%) in Group 2 experienced severe AEs. No severe 
AEs was recorded in Group 1. No SAE was deemed related to the vaccine. 
Because of the design and settings of the study, no strict comparison between groups can be done.  
8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated in order to add information 
on interchangeable use of Vaxelis with other hexavalent vaccines based on final results from Study V419-
016 (no update of the Package Leaflet (PL) needed). 
The SmPC changes to sections 4.2 and 5.1  initially proposed by the MAH were the following:

Q1 The study was conducted in Germany, Spain and Italy. The 2-dose primary vaccination is 
recommended in those countries, but based on information currently available at ECDC, it appears that 
the age for vaccination varies between these countries (2 and 4 months of age in Germany and Spain, 3 
and 5 months of age in Italy). In all 3 countries the boost is recommended at 11 months. The MAH is 
invited to provide the age of the participants at the time of primary vaccination.

not using qualified/validated tests (or at least IVD tests if applicable). 
Q3 The study was conducted in different countries which might have an impact on the results. The MAH is 
invited to present the results (for the safety and immunogenicity) by country. 
Q4 Specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and HEXYON were observed at 30 days post-
boost. Ab GMCs  but not seroprotection/seroresponse rates were presented at Day 1. Data should be 
presented. 
Q5 The MAH is required to submit stratified descriptive immunogenicity data for participants with/without 
use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, both in terms of seroprotection/seroresponse rates 
and in terms of GMCs, for the 2 groups and to discuss differences observed in each group and between 
groups. 
Q6 The MAH is required to submit stratified descriptive data for participants with/without use of 
analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, both for solicited local and for systemic adverse events, 
for the 2 groups, and to discuss differences observed in each group and between groups. 
Q7 For transparency and clarity in the EPAR (and even if it concerns only a limited number of AEs), it is 
requested to the MAH to clarify for each group: the percentage of unsolicited AEs in total and per SOC, of 
related unsolicited AEs in total and per SOC, and of unsolicited AEs by maximum intensity in total and per 
SOC. Any differences observed between the 2 groups should be discussed.

Clinical aspects 
Question 1  
The study was conducted in Germany, Spain and Italy. The 2-dose primary vaccination is recommended 
in those countries, but based on information currently available at ECDC, it appears that the age for 
vaccination varies between these countries (2 and 4 months of age in Germany and Spain, 3 and 5 
months of age in Italy). In all 3 countries the boost is recommended at 11 months. The MAH is invited to 
provide the age of the participants at the time of primary vaccination. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
Type II variation assessment report  
Error! Unknown document property name. 
Page 46/62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary series vaccination was performed at around 2 and 4 months as recommended per local 
standard of care in all countries participating in the trial. Of note, recommendations in Italy from the 
Ministero della Salute specify that the hexavalent vaccine primary series should be administered as soon 
as possible from the 61st day of life, that is two months of age, in line with what is prescribed in the 
other countries participating in the study. 
A summary of the age of the participants at the time of primary vaccination performed as part of the 
standard of care before entering the study is provided in Table 21. 
The language of the study protocol allowed some flexibility in the timing of the primary series and did not 
mandate a specific interval around the primary series vaccination dates, to account for the disruption 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the vaccination program with significant backlogs in the vaccination 
campaigns reported in all participating countries. Despite this allowed flexibility Table 1-1 illustrates that 
the mean age of first vaccination was similar between groups and countries. While there was somewhat 
more variation for the second vaccination, this variation is most conspicuous within the VVV group 
(particularly between Germany and Spain), but not between groups. When taken as a whole, as intended 
in the study, the mean age of vaccination for the first and second doses are similar between the VVV and 
HHV groups (Table 21). 
Table 21. Age at vaccination (Table 1-1 of RESPONSE TO AGENCY QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: 
interchangeable use of Vaxelis) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH clarified that the primary vaccination in Italy is also recommended from 2 months of age as per 
the recommendations from the Ministero della Salute. This is thus in line with the recommendations of 
both other countries.   
The MAH provided a Table presenting the age at vaccination per country and per group (overall and 
within in each country). Mean (SD) and Median (Min, Max) were included in the Table. 
Median age at first vaccination was overall comparable between countries and groups.  
Medians age range from 63.0 days (Italy, Group 1) to 74.6 days (Germany, Group 1). There were some 
flexibility for age at administration, most probably mimicking the real life. Minimum and maximum ages 
at first dose were 56.0 days (Germany, Group 2) and 140 days (Germany, Group 1). 
Medians age at second vaccination were more variable, ranging from 126 days (Spain, Group1) to 150 
days (Germany, Group 1). Minimum and maximum ages at first dose were 118 days (Germany, Group 2) 
and 217 days (Germany, Group 1).

Question 2  
The MAH is requested to provide the status of the serological assays, as well as main characteristics. The 
MAH should clarify if these assays were previously used in the CDP of VAXELIS. If the assays used are not 
those previously used and/or not validated, the MAH is invited to specify and justify reason(s) for not 
using qualified/validated tests (or at least IVD tests if applicable). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH specified that all serological assays used in V419-016 were validated. 
The MAH specified that since late stage Vaxelis Clinical Development Program (CDP) - primary conducted 
during the years 2011-2014 - adjustments and improvements have been made to certain assays and all 
assays have been validated. 
More specifically: 
Concerning the Hepatitis B Surface Antibody Enhanced Chemiluminescence (HBV ECiQ) Quantitative Test, 
used to quantitatively detect total antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (anti-HBs) in 
human serum : same assay was used as the one of Vaxelis’s CDP, transferred and revalidated at Q2 
solutions in 2022. Results of revalidation were submitted Table 22 and indicate that transferring this 
assay to a different laboratory did not affect its main characteristics in terms of limits of quantitation, 
precision, ruggedness, selectivity/recovery and dilutional linearity. 
Table 22: HBV ECiQ validation parameter summary (source Table 2-1 of RESPONSE TO AGENCY 
QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: interchangeable use of Vaxelis) 
Concerning the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) ELISA, for the 
measurement of specific IgG antibodies against the Hib capsular polysaccharide, polyribosylribitol- 
phosphate (PRP): the assay is different from the one that was used in the CDP of Vaxelis, which was the 
Hib total antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) retired in 2016. The novel assay to quantify anti-PRP specific

IgG (Hib EIA) is performed using the Binding Site Human Anti-Haemophilus influenzae type b Enzyme 
Immunoassay Kit. Diluted serum is added to microtiter wells coated with Hib polysaccharide antigen 
conjugated to human serum albumin. Anti-Hib IgG antibodies in the sample bind to the Hib 
polysaccharide antigen. After incubation and washing to remove unbound serum proteins, horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG is added and binds to any captured Hib-specific IgG 
molecules. After another wash step, tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate is added; the ensuing color 
development reaction is then stopped by the addition of a dilute phosphoric acid solution. The optical 
density (OD) is measured and is directly proportional to the amount of Hib IgG present in the serum 
specimen. Levels of Hib IgG are quantified by interpolation from a standard curve that is calibrated to the 
FDA Lot 1983 reference standard and are reported as μg/mL. This Hib-EIA assay used for V419-016 
clinical testing was validated at Q2 Solutions. Parameters assessed for validation were limits of 
quantitation, repeatability, intermediate precision, linearity and recovery and a summary of the validation 
parameter was presented in Table 23. 
Table 23: Hib EIA validation parameter summary (source Table 2-2 of RESPONSE TO AGENCY 
QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: interchangeable use of Vaxelis) 
Concerning the multiplexed serological assay used to measure IgG antibodies to Diphtheria Toxoid (DT), 
Tetanus Toxoid (TT), Pertussis Toxin (PT), Filamentous Haemagglutinin (FHA), Pertactin (PRN), and 
Fimbrial Agglutinogens (FIM 2/3): this assay is different from the 6 different assays used in the CDP of 
Vaxelis. For V419-016 clinical testing, IgG specific to these different antigens were measured using a 
validated multiplexed electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay format at Sanofi’s Global Clinical 
Immunology (GCI) lab (Swiftwater, PA). The aim was to improve efficiency and throughput compared to 
the previously utilized ELISA format for the CDP of Vaxelis. 
Concerning the Micro Metabolic Inhibition Tests (MIT) performed to measure functional anti-poliovirus 
types 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibodies: these assays are similar to the of the CDP of Vaxelis of Focus 
Diagnostics, Inc.. The novel MIT assays used for V419-016 clinical testing were validated at Sanofi’s 
Global Clinical Immunology (GCI) lab (Swiftwater, PA). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH specified in their answer that all serological assays used for V419-016 clinical testing were 
validated. 
The only assay that was equal to the one used in the CDP of VAXELIS, is the one to quantify total 
antibodies to hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (anti-HBs) in human serum (HBV ECiQ). This assay 
was transferred and revalidated at Q2 Solutions in 2022. The MAH provided a summary of the validation 
parameters of HBV ECiQ, which included the results of this revalidation of the assay. In terms of limits of 
quantitation, precision, ruggedness, selectivity/recovery and dilutional linearity results indicate that

transferring this assay to a different laboratory did not affect its main analytical characteristics. 
The serological assay to quantify specific IgG antibodies against the Hib capsular polysaccharide, 
polyribosylribitol- phosphate (PRP) that was used for the CDP of VAXELIS was no longer available and 
was replaced by the Hib-EIA assay. This assay is considered adequate for the purposes of V419-016 
clinical testing, in terms of the estimated ranges of the limits of quantitation, repeatability, intermediate 
precision, linearity and recovery (Table 23). 
The MAH did not submit the validation report of the multiplexed serological assay applied for the 
simultaneous quantification of human antibodies to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis 
antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM). This assay is different from the 6 separate assays that were used for 
the CDP of VAXELIS. 
The MAH did not submit the validation reports of the Micro Metabolic Inhibition Tests (MIT) performed to 
measure functional anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 neutralizing antibodies. 
Issue not pursued. 
Question 3  
The study was conducted in different countries which might have an impact on the results. The MAH is 
invited to present the results (for the safety and immunogenicity) by country. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, descriptive study in 3 countries (Spain, Germany, Italy), 
V419-016 was not designed to assess differences in safety and immunogenicity by country. Participants 
received their primary series of either Vaxelis or Hexyon prior to study participation. Of note, participants 
enrolled in Italy all received a Vaxelis primary series, as this was the vaccine offered at participating sites. 
Despite these caveats, the seroresponses and solicited adverse events results stratified by country show 
that the safety and immunogenicity of the Vaxelis booster dose does not meaningfully differ between 
countries, and the country specific immunogenicity and safety are consistent with the population as a 
whole, as shown in data below. 
Immunogenicity 
Vaxelis elicited antibody-specific responses to each antigen contained in both Vaxelis and Hexyon in each 
of the participating countries as assessed by the proportions of participants with antibody-specific 
responses at 30 days following a booster dose of Vaxelis. The proportions of participants with antibody-
specific responses to each antigen contained in both Vaxelis and Hexyon were generally comparable 
between the 2 groups at 30 days following a booster dose of Vaxelis, irrespective of the country 
considered. The proportions of participants with antibody-specific responses to pertussis FIM 2/3 and 
pertussis PRN (antigens contained only in Vaxelis) were higher in Group 1 (VVV) compared with Group 2 
(HHV) at 30 days following a booster dose of Vaxelis, irrespective of the country considered (Tables 3-1 
to 3-3). 
Overall, the immunogenicity results stratified by country are consistent with what is seen in the whole 
study population, with comparable immunogenicity observed between groups irrespective of the country 
considered. When considering the two groups separately among the countries that contributed with 
participants in the group, immunogenicity results were generally comparable for Group 1 (VVV) (Spain, 
Germany, Italy), as well as for Group 2 (HHV) (Spain, Germany). 
Safety

Overall, the solicited adverse events results stratified by country are consistent with what is seen in the 
whole study population. The proportions of participants with solicited AEs were generally comparable 
between the 2 groups following a booster dose of Vaxelis, irrespective of the country considered. When 
considering the two groups separately among the countries that contributed participants in that group, 
solicited adverse events where comparable for Group 1 (VVV) (Spain, Germany, Italy), as well as for 
Group 2 (HHV) (Spain, Germany) (Tables 3-4 to 3-6). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the MAH provided immunogenicity and safety results by country. It is acknowledge that the 
study was not designed for such comparison, results are nevertheless considered relevant/of interest for 
completeness in the reporting of V419-016 study results. 
All participants included in Italy received a VAXELIS primary series (Group 1). Number of participants in 
this country is limited (n=11). Overall, number of toddlers by group in each country is limited. 
The MAH provided summaries of the proportions of participants meeting specified VAXELIS antigen 
responses at 30 days post-vaccination per country. GMTs were not provided. Overall, the immunogenicity 
results stratified by country are consistent with those of whole PP population. Seroresponder rates are 
comparable for Group 1 (Germany, Italy, Spain) and for Group 2 (Germany, Spain) across countries. 
The MAH provided summaries of the proportions of participants with solicited AEs per country. Overall, 
the solicited AEs results stratified by country are consistent with those of whole PP population. Percentage 
of solicited injection site AEs observed in Group 1 tends to be higher in Spain (93.2%, 95% CI: 81.3-
98.6) when compared to those of Germany (73.3%, 95% CI: 54.1-87.7) and Italy (72.7%, 95% CI: 
39.0-94.0). For solicited systemics AEs, percentage observed in Group 1 in Italy (63.6%, 95% CI: 30.8-
89.1) is lower than those of both other countries (Spain: 95.5%, 95% I: 84.5-99.4; Germany: 96.7%, 
95% 82.8-99.9) but the number of participants in Italy is too limited to draw definitive conclusion 
(n=11). 
Issue resolved. 
Question 4 
Specific Ab to each antigen contained in both VAXELIS and HEXYON were observed at 30 days post-
boost. Ab GMCs but not seroprotection/seroresponse rates were presented at Day 1. Data should be 
presented. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The proportion of responders at Day 1 is presented for all antigens shared by Vaxelis and Hexyon in Table 
24. The endpoints used to evaluate the immune responses at Day 1 are the same used to evaluate the 
responses at Day 30 as per primary endpoint of the study with the addition of the short-term correlate of 
protection for Hib. Pertussis antigens are not presented in the table since there are currently no 
established immunological correlates of protection and the seroresponse rates calculated at Day 30 were 
dependent on the fold increase over Day 1 concentrations. 
Of note: Day 1 data reflect the 2 dose primary series given prior to study entry. Overall, the proportion of 
responders at Day 1 is comparable for all antigens between the groups, with the exception of Hib. At Day 
1 prior to the booster dose, the proportion of participants who achieved the long-term protective 
concentration of anti-Hib-PRP IgG ≥1.0 µg/mL was higher in the VVV group 51/79 (64.6%), compared to 
the HHV group 1/81 (1.2%). Additional post hoc analysis (Table 25) showed that the proportion of 
participants who achieved short term protective concentration of anti Hib-PRP ≥0.15 µg/mL was also 
higher in the VVV group (69/79, 87.3%) compared to the HHV group (22/81, 27.2%). These data further

support the evidence that the PRP-OMPC conjugation used in Vaxelis, result in a more robust immune 
response following even a 2-dose primary series as compared to the PRP-T conjugation used in Hexyon 
and Infanrix hexa , as already observed in previously published studies [2 – 4].

QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: interchangeable use of Vaxelis) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided a Table including the proportion of responders at Day 1 (pre-vaccination) for all 
antigens shared by VAXELIS and HEXYON, except for the pertussis antigens PT and FHA because of no Ab 
threshold associated with protection. GMTs specific for PT and FHA at Day 1 were presented at initial 
submission, which is deemed sufficient.  
Proportion of participants showing Ab titers equal or above the Ab thresholds associated with protection 
against diphtheria, tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses and hepatitis B were overall comparable 
between groups (95% CI overlapping). In contrast, anti-PRP Ab levels were not comparable between 
groups. Only 1 out of 81 participant of Group 2 (H,H,V) had anti-PRP Ab levels equal or above the 
threshold associated with long-term protection, versus 51/79 (64.6%) of Group 1. Proportion of 
participants who achieved short term protective concentration of anti Hib-PRP ≥0.15 µg/mL was 
calculated. Although the percentages of participants with Ab levels ≥0.15 µg/mL was higher than those 
with Ab levels ≥1.0 µg/mL, the percentage observed in Group 2 was still lower than the percentage 
observed in Group 1 (27.2% [22/81] versus 87.3% [69/79]), indicating the importance of the booster 
dose.

Question 5  
The MAH is required to submit stratified descriptive immunogenicity data for participants with/without use 
of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, both in terms of seroprotection/seroresponse rates and 
in terms of GMCs, for the 2 groups and to discuss differences observed in each group and between 
groups. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the MAH analyzed the use of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications on the 
immunogenicity of Vaxelis. A total of 55 participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination were identified (Group 1 VVV n=27; Group 2 HHV n=28). Analgesic/antipyretic reported as 
concomitant medications on the day of vaccination included paracetamol or ibuprofen. One participant 
reported the use of both paracetamol and ibuprofen. No other analgesic/antipyretic, or 
immunosuppressant medication, were reported on the day of vaccination. V419-016 was not designed to 
assess the effects of antipyretic/analgesic use on vaccination and only 33% of participants received these 
medications. Caution should be used when interpreting any differences in responses with these small 
numbers. 
Seroprotection/seroresponse rates stratified by use of analgesic/antipyretic are shown in Table 26 and 
Table 27 and are consistent with the population as a whole. 
The proportions of participants with antibody-specific responses to each antigen contained in both Vaxelis 
and Hexyon were generally comparable between the 2 groups at 30 days following a booster dose of 
Vaxelis, regardless of the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination. The proportions of 
participants with antibody-specific responses to pertussis PRN and FIM2/3 were higher in Group 1 (VVV) 
compared with Group 2 (HHV) regardless of the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination. 
Similarly, Day 30 postvaccination antibody GMCs for participants without and with analgesic/antipyretic 
use are shown in Table 28 and Table 29 and are consistent with the population as a whole. 
Analgesic/antipyretic use on the day of vaccination did not affect between-group comparisons for 
example: Antibody-specific GMCs for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis PT, pertussis FIM 2/3, 
pertussis PRN, and HBsAg were numerically higher in Group 1 (VVV) compared with Group 2 (HHV), 
regardless of the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination. Antibody specific GMC’s for 
poliovirus 1-3 were numerically lower in the HHV group participants and the antibody-specific GMCs for 
HBsAg in the VVV group participants who used analgesic/antipyretic. However the seroresponse rates 
remains generally comparable within the groups regardless of analgesic/antipyretics use and these 
differences are not considered clinically meaningful. 
Overall, the use of analgesic/antipyretic resulted in minimal, if any, differences in the immunogenicity 
profile between the two arms or within each arm of the study.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the requested analyses, i.e. immune responses at 1 month post-vaccination according 
to the use of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications on the day of vaccination. It is acknowledged 
that the study was not designed for such comparison, results are nevertheless of interest.  
A total of 55 participants used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, n= 27/85 (32%) in Group 
1 and n=28/82 (34%) in Group 2. However, GMC Ab responses are not available for all the participants, 
resulting in limited number of participants per group. No other analgesic/antipyretic, or 
immunosuppressant medication, than paracetamol or ibuprofen were reported on the day of vaccination.  
In terms of percentages of participants achieving thresholds associated with protection against diphtheria, 
tetanus, clinical paralysis due to polioviruses, hepatitis B and long-term protection against Haemophilus 
Influenzae Type b, no differences between participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination and those who did not were observed.  
Results were overall consistent with those of whole PP population. 
In terms of Ab GMCs, results were also overall consistent with those of whole PP population except for the 
specific responses to polioviruses, particularly for Group 2. In addition, trend for lower Ab GMCs for all 3 
polioviruses were observed for participants of Group 2 who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination versus those of Group 2 who did not. However, 95% CIs were large and still overlapping. A 
trend for lower anti-HBsAg Ab was observed in Group 1 participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on

the day of vaccination when compared to those who did not.  
Such results might be explained by the limited sample size per group. The clinical relevance is considered 
limited since percentages of participants reaching the Ab thresholds associated with protection were high 
in all groups. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 6  
The MAH is required to submit stratified descriptive data for participants with/without use of 
analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, both for solicited local and for systemic adverse events, 
for the 2 groups, and to discuss differences observed in each group and between groups. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
V419-016 was not designed to look at antipyretic/analgesic use with vaccination and only around 33% of 
participants received these medications. Therefore, any differences should be interpreted with caution. 
Solicited adverse events stratified by use of analgesic/antipyretic are shown in Table 30 and Table 31. 
There are 27 and 28 participants who used antipyretic/analgesic in Group 1 (VVV) and Group 2 (HHV) 
respectively. 
Overall, the proportions of participants with solicited AEs were generally comparable between the 2 
groups following a booster dose of Vaxelis, regardless of the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of 
vaccination. Within each group no clinically meaningful differences were seen in the reporting of solicited 
local or systemic AEs for those participants with or without analgesic/antipyretic use. 
Overall, no difference in the local and systemic solicited events profile was observed between and within 
groups regardless of the use of analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination.

participants as treated population) (Participants with analgesic or antipyretic administered on the day of 
vaccination) (Table 6-2 of AGENCY QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: interchangeable use of Vaxelis) 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the requested analyses, i.e. incidence of solicited AEs at 1 month post-vaccination 
according to the use of analgesic and anti-inflammatory medications on the day of vaccination. It is 
acknowledged that the study was not designed for such comparison, results are nevertheless considered 
relevant/of interest for completeness in the reporting of V419-016 study results. 
A total of 55 participants used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, n= 27/85 (32%) in Group 
1 and n=28/82 (34%) in Group 2. No other analgesic/antipyretic, or immunosuppressant medication, 
than paracetamol or ibuprofen were reported on the day of vaccination.  
Solicited systemic AEs were reported in all Group 1 participants and in 23/28 (82.1%) of the Group 2 
participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination, which is higher than the 
percentages observed in participants who did not (87.9% and 63.0% in Group 1 and in Group 2, 
respectively). A trend for higher percentage of Group 2 participants experiencing solicited injection site 
AEs was also observed in participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination (82.1%) 
versus those who did not (72.2%). In Group 1, the percentage of participants experiencing solicited 
injection site AEs was similar in participants who used analgesic/antipyretic on the day of vaccination 
(85.2%) versus those who did not (82.8%) 
Because of the limited sample size per group, interpretation should be cautious and no firm conclusion 
can be drawn. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 7 
For transparency and clarity in the EPAR (and even if it concerns only a limited number of AEs), it is 
requested to the MAH to clarify for each group: the percentage of unsolicited AEs in total and per SOC, of

related unsolicited AEs in total and per SOC, and of unsolicited AEs by maximum intensity in total and per 
SOC. Any differences observed between the 2 groups should be discussed.  
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The requested information is provided in:.

- 
Table 32 summarizes the number of participants with unsolicited adverse events per group in 
total and per SOC.  
Table 33 summarizes the number of participants with unsolicited adverse events related to study 
vaccine per group, in total and per event.  
Table 7-3 in the RESPONSE TO AGENCY QUESTIONS - Study V419-016: interchangeable use of 
Vaxelis summarizes the number of participants with unsolicited adverse events by maximum 
intensity per group, in total and per SOC. Of the participants with unsolicited AEs graded by 
intensity, the majority had events with a maximum intensity of mild or moderate in both groups.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH provided the requested analyses. 
A total of 44/85 (51.8%) and 52/82 (63.4%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited AEs. Percentages of unsolicited AEs per SOC were overall 
comparable except for the SOC General disorder and administration site conditions with a trend for higher 
percentages in Group 2 (53.7%) when compared to Group 1 (42.4%). There were 6/44 (7.3%) of the 
Group 2 participants who experienced induration at the site of injection versus 0 in Group 1. Although no 
difference of percentages between groups for the SOC Gastrointestinal disorders was observed overall, 
higher percentage of toddlers experienced diarrhea in Group 2 (7.3%: 6/10) when compared to Group 1 
(1.2%: 1/9). 
A total of 36/85 (42.4%) and 41/82 (50.0%) of the toddlers in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively 
experienced one or more unsolicited AEs related to the study vaccine. The main difference was the 7.3% 
of the Group 2 participants who experienced induration at the site of injection versus 0 in Group 1. 
Among the toddlers who experienced one or more unsolicited AEs, a higher percentages of toddlers in 
Group 2 versus Group 1 experienced severe AEs: 9.8% (8 severe AEs: 6 pyrexia, 1 nausea, 1 urticaria) 
vs 0%, respectively.  
Issue resolved.

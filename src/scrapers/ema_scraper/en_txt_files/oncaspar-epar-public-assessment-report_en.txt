2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoid neoplasms that result 
from monoclonal proliferation and accumulation of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral 
blood and other organs.  
ALL is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and represents 25% of cancer diagnoses 
among children younger than 15 years. In absolute terms, however, ALL is a very rare disease, 
even in children. Its incidence has a bimodal distribution with a sharp peak among children aged 2 
to 3 years (>90 per million per year), with rates decreasing to 30 per million by age 8 years  
(NCI at the NIH: Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment, March 2013). A second 
steady increase in the incidence of ALL begins at approximately 50 years of age, with a peak 
incidence of about 2 per 100,000. Overall, estimated incidence in the EU is 1.28 per 100,000 
persons, corresponding to a total of approximately 5,600 new cases per year. 
The recognised chromosomal abnormalities in ALL result in biological differences in the condition, 
and are important for prognosis and for therapeutic decisions. For example, Philadelphia 
chromosome positive (Ph+) ALL, which is caused by the translocation of the BCR and the ABL 
genes, is associated with a very poor prognosis. 
ALL is divided into subtypes based on the presence of B- or T-cell lineage-specific differentiation 
antigens detected on the surface of leukaemic blast cells. Precursor B-cell ALL (including early pre-
B and pre-B-cell ALL) is the most common (approximately 70% to 80%) subtype in both children 
and adults. Mature B-cell ALL (Burkitt’s leukaemia / lymphoma) has been reported in 2% to 5% of 
children and adults. T-cell ALL has been diagnosed in 15% to 25% of paediatric and adult patients 
with ALL. It occurs more commonly in older adolescents and young adults than in young children, 
with an incidence of approximately 25% of all ALL in patients 16 to 21 years of age. 
The treatment for ALL typically consists of a remission-induction phase, an intensification  
(or consolidation) phase and continuation / maintenance therapy to eliminate residual disease. 
Treatment is also directed to the Central Nervous System (CNS) early in the clinical course to 
prevent relapse attributable to leukaemic cells sequestered in this site (Pui et al, 2008).  
Treatment depends on the use of intensive multi-agent chemotherapy given over 6 to 9 months in 
combination with central nervous system prophylactic therapy with cranial radiation and intrathecal 
chemotherapy followed by maintenance chemotherapy for 2 to 3 years.  
All phases of treatment involve combination chemotherapy. Current treatment guidelines 
(European LeukemiaNet and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) recommend treatment with 
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs). In Europe, the following TKIs are currently approved for the 
treatment of ALL and LBL: Glivec (imatinib); Sprycel (dasatinib); Tasigna (nilotinib); Iclusig 
(ponatinib). 
Assessment Report 
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 9/122 
 
 
 
In addition, drugs used during induction typically include vincristine, prednisone, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and L-asparaginase. Cytarabine and methotrexate are often added 
during consolidation / intensification. Maintenance therapy frequently includes 6-mercaptopurine, 
methotrexate, steroids and vincristine (NCCN guideline, November 2015). 
Allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation is of great importance especially in patients at high risk 
or after a recurrence. 
All these protocols involve the use of L-asparaginase during induction and consolidation 
/intensification phases. The objective of asparaginase therapy is to deplete physiological 
asparagine so that it is unavailable to tumour cells. 
Historically, native E coli-derived asparaginase was used as the initial intervention. However, 
treatment-limiting immune response can occur.  Once hypersensitivity is apparent, it is necessary 
to switch to a different asparaginase preparation. Therapy can then continue until a treatment-
limiting immune response to the substituted asparaginase occurs. 
Pegaspargase (Oncaspar, Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc) was authorised in the US on 24 July 2006 
for the first-line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a component of a 
multi-agent chemotherapy regimen. Oncaspar was previously approved in the US in February 1994 
for the treatment of patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to native forms of L-asparaginase. 
In Europe, Oncaspar was authorised in 1994 in Germany and in Poland in 2008 for the treatment of 
patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to native forms of asparaginase. The national marketing 
authorisations in Germany and Poland will be withdrawn upon launch of the centrally-authorised 
product Oncaspar.   
Excellent progress has been made in the therapy of childhood ALL over the past five decades with 
combination chemotherapy and central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis having improved the 
cure rate from 5% in 1950 to 85% in 2000 (Bailey et al, 2008). In contrast, while dose-intense 
multi-agent regimens administered to adult patients with ALL now achieve remission rates 
exceeding 80%, 5-year survival is only around 40% (Faderl et al, 2008). 
About the product 
Oncaspar is a modified version of the enzyme L-asparaginase. The International Non-proprietary 
Name (INN) is pegaspargase. The chemical name is monomethoxypolyethylene glycol succinimidyl 
L-asparaginase. Asparaginase is modified by covalently conjugating units of 
monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG; molecular weight of 5,000) to the enzyme, forming the 
active ingredient pegaspargase.  
The mechanism of action of L-asparaginase is the enzymatic cleavage of the amino acid L-
asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. Depletion of L-asparagine in blood serum results in 
inhibition of protein-synthesis, DNA-synthesis and RNA-synthesis, especially in leukaemic blasts 
which are not able to synthetise L-asparagine, thus undergoing apoptosis. 
Normal cells, in contrast, are capable of synthesising L-asparagine and are less affected by its rapid 
withdrawal during treatment with the enzyme L-asparaginase. The PEGylation does not change the 
enzymatic properties of L-asparaginase, but it influences the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity 
of the enzyme (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The applied indication was as follows: 
“Oncaspar is indicated as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy in acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, adolescents and adult patients”. 
The recommended indication is as follows:  
Assessment Report 
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 10/122 
 
 
 
Oncaspar is indicated as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and adult patients (see SmPC section 
4.1) 
Oncaspar should be prescribed and administered by physicians and health care personnel 
experienced in the use of antineoplastic products. It should only be given in a hospital setting 
where appropriate resuscitation equipment is available. 
Oncaspar is usually employed as part of combination chemotherapy protocols with other 
antineoplastic agents (see also section 4.5). 
The recommended dose of Oncaspar in patients (including children) with a body surface area ≥ 0.6 
m2 and who are ≤ 21 years of age is 2500 U (equivalent to 3.3 ml Oncaspar)/m² body surface area 
every 14 days. Children with a body surface area <0.6 m² should receive 82.5 U (equivalent to 0.1 
ml Oncaspar)/kg body weight every 14 days. 
For adults >21 years, unless otherwise prescribed, the recommended posology is 2000 U/m2 every 
14 days (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Treatment may be monitored based on the trough serum asparaginase activity measured before 
the next administration of Oncaspar. If asparaginase activity values fail to reach target levels, a 
switch to a different asparaginase preparation could be considered (see section 4.4). 
Oncaspar can be given by intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion. For smaller volumes of 
Oncaspar, the preferred route of administration is intramuscular. When Oncaspar is given by 
intramuscular injection the volume injected at one site should not exceed 2 ml in children and 
adolescents and 3 ml in adults. If higher volume is given, the dose should be divided and given at 
several injection sites. Intravenous infusion of Oncaspar is usually given over a period of 1 to 2 
hours in 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection or 5% dextrose solution 
together with an already-running infusion (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Oncaspar solution for injection or infusion is a sterile, preservative-free, isotonic, single-dose 
solution of PEGylated L-asparaginase (INN: pegaspargase) in phosphate buffered saline intended 
for intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion. The product is proposed as a component of 
antineoplastic combination therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children, adolescents 
and adult patients. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
A) Asparaginase  
General information 
Asparaginase is a homotetrameric enzyme, comprised of four identical subunits with a mass of 
34,592 kDa coupled by weak, non-covalent, largely hydrophobic interactions. The tetrameric 
structure of the L-asparaginase enzyme is required for enzymatic activity. The asparaginase used 
for production of Oncaspar is a high-affinity type II asparaginase expressed in E. coli.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process starts with the thawing of the E. Coli working cell bank. The cells are 
expanded in shake flask prior transfer into seed and production bioreactor with appropriated 
controls which includes pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature.  
When the harvest criteria is achieved, the cells are harvested, homogenized and cell debris is 
separated prior to further purification. The different steps in purification includes hydrophobic 
interaction chromatography, anion and cation exchange chromatography as well as clearance steps 
to effectively deplete product and process related impurities. Following purification the active 
substance is dispended into sterile container and subjected to testing and release.  
The characterisation and testing of banked cell substrates were performed in accordance with ICH 
Q5D. Raw materials are tested according to European pharmacopoeia (where available), or 
according to in-house monographs. 
Process validation 
Process validation consisted in the analysis of data derived from three consecutive full-scale lots of 
asparaginase. Evaluation of in-process controls, analytical control of buffers, and release quality 
controls demonstrate that the manufacturing process of asparaginase is consistent. Removal of key 
impurities throughout the process was satisfactorily addressed at each step. The stability of 
process intermediates and buffers was appropriately evaluated. The lifetime of columns was 
evaluated. 
Characterisation 
Orthogonal methods have been applied to determine and confirm the expected primary structure of 
asparaginase, physicochemical properties and purity of asparaginase. This includes overall amino 
acid sequence, N-terminal sequence, disulphide bond configuration, molecular mass and isoelectric 
point as well as product and process related impurities. Furthermore biologic activity was 
determined by enzyme kinetics.  
Specification 
The proposed release tests are acceptable, including measures of enzymatic activity, and methods 
to control for product-related substances, product-related impurities and process-related 
impurities. During the procedure, some acceptance criteria were revised and the Applicant 
completed a review of all analytical procedure validation data, including results from original 
validation studies and subsequent analytical method transfers. As no international reference 
standard is available for asparaginase, the strength of the product is reported as product specific 
in-house units.  
Stability 
Data obtained from primary stability studies support the claimed shelf-life. The claimed holding 
time was also considered acceptable.

B) Pegaspargase active substance 
The active substance pegaspargase (pegylated asparaginase) is a covalent conjugate of E. coli-
derived asparaginase with monomethoxypropylene glycol. It results from the reaction between 
polyethylene glycol succinimidyl succinate (SS-PEG) and exposed primary amines on the 
asparaginase  
Manufacture 
The pegaspargase active substance manufacturing process starts with the pegylation reaction. 
Asparaginase is combined with polyethylene glycol succinimidyl succinate (SS-PEG) followed by 
clarification and purification steps. Finally the process solution is diluted to meet the final product 
specification of 750 U/mL. The active substance was subjected to testing and can be hold at 2-8°C 
prior to manufacturing of the final finished product. 
For the active substance manufacturing process asparaginase and SS-PEG are used. A flow chart of 
the manufacturing process of SS-PEG, as well as its specification, have been provided. The 
potential/actual impurities were also discussed and justified from the toxicological point of view.  
Other raw materials (including components of the final formulation) are tested according to 
European pharmacopoeia (where available), or according to in-house monographs.  
Process validation 
Process validation consisted in the analysis of data derived from three consecutive commercial lots 
of pegaspargase. All batches used asparaginase manufactured by the previous supplier M, which is 
not the proposed supplier L within the framework of this application. Considering that Supplier L 
and Supplier M products were demonstrated comparable, this approach can be considered 
acceptable. Evaluation of in-process controls, analytical control of buffers, and release quality 
controls demonstrate that the manufacturing process of pegaspargase is consistent. 
Changes were introduced during development. Batch testing results and comparability exercises 
that were executed to support these changes indicate a high degree of similarity between the pre- 
and post-change product. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation studies have been provided for structure and properties relevant for the pegylated 
enzyme. They included analyses of the number and sites of pegylation, higher order structures, 
purity and impurities, and enzyme kinetics. Elucidation of primary structure was not repeated since 
it was already done at the level of asparaginase.  
The secondary structure of the protein was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis 
of three L-ASNase conformance batches. 
Characterisation studies were derived from two batches that were used in the comparability 
program between pegaspargase manufactured from Supplier L asparaginase vs. pegaspargase 
manufactured from Supplier M asparaginase. Product- and process-related impurities which can be 
present in the active substance pegaspargase have been identified. They are controlled at release, 
and during stability if appropriate. The un-pegylated asparaginase, which was classified as product-
related substance, is monitored only by indirect methods. 
Specification 
The pegaspargase bulk solution (active substance) and the finished product manufacturing 
processes are continuous; thus, no formal batch release is performed at the active substance level. 
The proposed specification is a subset of the testing panel performed at the finished product batch 
release. All proposed acceptance criteria are identical, apart from potency which is slightly tighter.

Appropriate justification including clarification on the method used to calculate the acceptable 
ranges has been provided.  
Stability 
No formal shelf-life is claimed for the active substance and the claimed holding time before 
entering into the finished product manufacturing process was acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented in a vial (type I glass), with a fill volume of 5 mL, at the strength 
of 750 U/mL. The product is formulated in a buffer solution with sodium dihydrogen phosphate 
monohydrate/disodium phosphate heptahydrate and sodium chloride. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product was developed for parenteral administration in a phosphate buffered saline 
solution. Its formulation has remained unchanged since the start of product development. No 
overage is claimed however an overfill is applied to ensure an extractable volume of 5.0 mL.  
In 2008 an alternative manufacturer was added and thereafter, became the sole manufacturing 
site for Oncaspar production. Compatibility of the container closure system with the dosage form 
was assessed with respect to stability testing, media fill testing and container closure integrity 
testing. The microbiological quality complies with European requirements for sterile products. The 
integrity of the container closure system is monitored by both a dye ingress test and a bacterial 
immersion test. The compatibility of the finished product with diluent solution (0.9 % NaCl; 5% 
glucose solution) and representative catheters was appropriately addressed. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Overall the manufacturing process is well described and appropriately validated.  
The manufacturing process can be summarised as follows: the filling equipment is steam sterilised, 
the bulk substance solution passes through a filter and is subsequently filled into vials and closed 
by a stopper. After capping and sealing vials are subjected to release testing including visual 
inspection and are transferred into 2-8°C for storage.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes tests for general attributes, enzymatic activity, identity, 
and purity. The proposed specification for the finished product is identical to the specification for 
Quality Control testing of the active substance, with the exception of three tests which are only 
performed on the finished product (extractable volume, sub-visible particles, sterility) and one test 
for which the acceptance criteria differ between the active substance and the finished product 
(potency).   
The Applicant provided all the requested information and details in order to evaluate the 
appropriateness of the proposed specifications. Some of the acceptance criteria have been 
tightened if compared with the originally submitted ones. The specifications have to take into 
consideration that, using as starting material a SS-PEG containing a low level of impurities, a low 
and stable aggregates level is expected as demonstrated by the Applicant.

Stability of the product 
The Applicant originally claimed a 1-year shelf life at 2-8°C but stability data clearly show that 
there is a purity decrease due to the release of free PEG from the pegylated molecule. Moreover 
the enzymatic activity of pegaspargase increases over the claimed shelf-life. This is of concerns 
since the instability of the product could lead to administrate lower dose of pegaspargase and 
significant amount of asparaginase at end-of shelf-life, with potential in vivo effects of release of 
PEG from asparaginase (in vivo half-life, immunogenicity). The Applicant accepted to revise the 
shelf-life from 12 months to 8 months in order to limit de-PEGylation. As a result, the increasing of 
enzymatic activity of pegaspargase over the new proposed shelf-life has been limited and the 
Applicant’s proposal is endorsed. The potential impact in terms of efficacy and safety of the 
increasing of activity of pegaspargase over the new proposed shelf-life and related purity decrease 
is discussed in clinical assessment (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Adventitious agents 
Oncaspar is manufactured from an L-ASNase expressed in E. coli, a bacterial cell host which does 
not support replication of viral agents which may infect humans. The manufacturing process (cells 
banks and production) involves materials of biological origin that have been fully and appropriately 
documented regarding the viral safety. The adventitious agent safety evaluation presented is 
sufficient and adequate. 
Comparability exercise for finished product 
Oncaspar was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was authorised in the US in 1994 in 
second line use in ALL following the development of hypersensitivity to native asparaginase: 
authorisation in the first-line treatment of ALL was obtained in 2006. This was based primarily on 
clinical data obtained in Study CCG-1962 and CCG-1991. Oncaspar was registered in Germany in 
1994 and in Poland in 2008 for the treatment of patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to 
native forms of asparaginase.  
The US and German products used asparaginase from different sources. Oncaspar sold in the US 
used enzyme manufactured by Supplier M. Oncaspar authorised in Germany and Poland used 
enzyme manufactured by Supplier K. In both cases the PEGylation and subsequent manufacturing 
steps were performed by Sigma-Tau Inc in its Indianapolis manufacturing facility.  
In 2010 in US the enzyme manufacturer was switched from Supplier M to Supplier L in response to 
Supplier M discontinuing manufacture of asparaginase. The enzyme Master Cell Bank is a 
descendant of the Master Cell Bank used by Supplier M.  
In Europe, no change to the manufacturer of enzyme active substance has ever been made–all 
Oncaspar distributed in Europe has been manufactured using asparaginase from Supplier K. 
The Applicant strategy was to submit a MAA for a product containing the enzyme supplied by 
Supplier L on the basis that the active substance is comparable to the pegaspargase containing 
both Supplier M and K enzyme. To support the use of the Supplier L enzyme, the product was 
analytically compared with Supplier M asparaginase (to demonstrate comparability with the product 
used in all original development studies and commercially used in the USA for decades); and with 
Supplier K asparaginase (to demonstrate comparability with the product commercially used in the 
EU since 1994). Furthermore, the comparability studies between PEGylated Supplier L vs. 
PEGylated Supplier M asparaginase and between PEGylated Supplier L asparaginase vs. PEGylated 
Supplier K asparaginase were also performed at the finished product level. 
Due to discontinuation of asparaginase production by Supplier M, only limited data were available 
for the comparison between Supplier M and Supplier L batches. Based on few data provided, it 
appears that Supplier L and Supplier M asparaginase/pegaspargase are comparable in terms of 
Assessment Report

primary and higher order structure, extent of modification with PEG, activity and stability 
behaviour. Higher purity results are observed for Supplier L batches, especially at the level of 
asparaginase. Low levels of 3 impurities, proven to be product-related compounds, were reported 
to be found in Supplier L asparaginase however were not present at measurable levels in Supplier 
M asparaginase. Comparability between Supplier L and Supplier K asparaginase/pegaspargase 
included three batches of each supplier. As for Supplier L vs Supplier M, K and Supplier L 
asparaginase/pegaspargase were found to be essentially similar with respect to structure, 
pegylation, activity and stability behaviour. A certain variability has been observed for enzyme 
kinetics parameters however it remains within the pre-defined acceptance criteria. The overall 
purity profile of Supplier L asparaginase appears to be higher than K asparaginase. 
To enable a conclusion on comparability, further explanation was requested on the setting of 
acceptance criteria and the impact of using different PEG suppliers. The Applicant was also 
requested to perform a direct side-by-side comparison between release data for historical batches 
(Supplier M) and the batches produced using Supplier L asparaginase. The data range of lots of 
Supplier L asparaginase and lots of Supplier L-pegaspargase/finished product were compared to 
lots of Supplier M asparaginase and lots of Supplier M derived-pegaspargase/finished product. In 
addition, stability profiles of Oncaspar-Supplier M and Oncaspar-Supplier L were also assessed. 
Overall, data support the conclusion that both products derived from Supplier L and Supplier M 
asparaginase are comparable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information about the active substance was of acceptable quality. The active substance and 
finished product manufacturing processes have been satisfactorily described and the validation 
data shows consistent manufacture. 
Specification limits and analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of the active 
substance and finished product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and 
satisfactory documentation has been provided. The results indicate that the active substance as 
well as the finished product can be reproducibly manufactured and adequately controlled. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommended some additional points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  programme  for  Oncaspar  is  a  battery  of  studies  conducted  in  late  1980s-early 
1990s  in  compliance  with  the  standards  of  the  day.  These  studies  were  also  used  to  support  the 
marketing  authorisations  in  the  USA  (1994),  Germany  (1994)  and  Poland  (2008).  All  non-clinical 
studies were carried out testing PEG-L-asparaginase manufactured using native enzyme produced 
by  Supplier  M,  with  the  exception  of  a  pharmacokinetic  study  in  Rhesus  monkeys  where  PEG-L-

investigating L-Asparaginase at doses of 200, 800, 3000 IU/kg IV for a duration of 3 months did 
not show any effect on the general behavior and ECG.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated study aimed to assess the PD drug interaction was performed. 
Published information is available describing potential pharmacodynamic drug interactions of PEG-
L-asparaginase  with  other  drugs  that  are  used  for  the  treatment  of  tumours  in  different  animal 
models.  
The  antitumour  activity  was  studied  in  dogs  suffering  from  spontaneously  occurring  malignant 
lymphoma.  Twenty  dogs  were  treated  with  either  PEG-L-asparaginase  (10-30  IU/kg  i.p.,  weekly) 
alone  or  combined  with  one  cycle  of  chemotherapy  (vincristine,  cyclophosphamide,  methotrexate 
and  prednisone),  followed  by  maintenance  therapy  with  PEG-L-asparaginase  (30  IU/kg  i.p., 
weekly; n=17 dogs). With the addition of chemotherapy agents, the response rate (complete and 
partial  response)  was  88%  (15/17  dogs)  versus  70%  (14/20  dogs)  for  PEG-L-asparaginase  alone 
when used as a single agent (MacEwen, 1987).  
In  MiaPaCa-2  tumour  xenograft  mouse  model,  a  synergistic  anti-tumour  activity  was  noted  when 
PEG-L-asparaginase  was  combined  with  gemcitabine.  PEG-L-asparaginase  and  gemcitabine  were 
administered  alone  or  in  combination.  Observed  tumour  growth  inhibition  as  compared  to 
untreated  controls  was  59%  for  PEG-L-asparaginase  alone,  64%  for  gemcitabine  alone  and  86% 
for the combination of both drugs. No increase in response was seen with increased doses of PEG-
L-asparaginase.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two non-GLP pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic studies (#04-2861 and #04-3082), and two 
GLP toxicology/toxicokinetic studies (Studies #824-015 and #824-016) were carried out comparing 
PEG-L-asparaginase with new PEG-L-asparaginase conjugates. No non-clinical study was conducted 
with the PEG-L-asparaginase derived from Supplier L supplier which is proposed for marketing.

Absorption  
In mice, PEG-L-asparaginase was found to have a greatly extended plasma half-life compared to 
native L-asparaginase, of 3.75 days versus 0.21 days and immunization with PEG-L-asparaginase 
had no effect on the clearance of the drug (Abuchowski, 1984). Systemic exposure was similar in 
mice receiving the test drug via i.p. or i.v. routes and slightly lower with i.m. administration. 
However the t1/2 was similar for all three routes of administration and asparaginase activity was 
still detectable up to 13 days after dosing (Study #7). In mice dosed via the i.m. route, plasma 
asparaginase activity was significantly longer for PEG-L-asparaginase compared to native L-
asparaginase, 8 days versus less than 24 hours (Study #53). 
In rats, following i.m. and i.v. administration of PEG-L-asparaginase, Cmax and AUC values 
increased with the increasing dose in a proportional fashion (Study #04-2861). Study #824-015 
also supported that systemic exposure of rats increased with the increasing single dose: following a 
single i.v. administration of 100 and 500 IU/kg of PEG-L-asparaginase, plasma asparaginase 
activities were quantifiable up to 336 h post-dose except four female out of 8 given the low dose of 
100 IU/kg PEG-L-asparaginase and one female out of 8 given the high dose of 500 IU/kg. Plasma 
asparaginase activities were also increased in the plasma of rats after multiple dosing (Study #3).

In rabbits, plasma L-asparaginase activity dropped rapidly after the administration of native L- 
asparaginase (t1/2 of 20h) being barely measurable on day 4 following the injection. Plasma 
asparagine concentration returned to normal by day 6 after dosing. With PEG-L-asparaginase, 
plasma L-asparaginase activity remained detectable till day 27 with a t1/2 of 144 h and plasma 
asparagine levels were depressed for 27 days (Ho, 1988).  
In dogs, the i.m. bioavailability in dogs was around 100% independently by the administered dose. 
No dose-dependency of t1/2 or CL was observed after either i.v. or i.m. injection. Plasma 
asparagine concentration decreased to undetectable levels within 10 minutes following i.v. and i.m. 
administration of PEG-L-asparaginase. In the dogs treated with PEG-asparaginase i.m., asparagine 
did not recover until Day 17 and Day 23 for the mid-dose and low-dose group, respectively, while 
it was undetectable for the entire study (23 days) for the high-dose group (Study #04-3082). In 
another study (#824-016), following single intravenous administration of 100 and 500 IU/kg of 
PEG-L-asparaginase, plasma asparaginase activity was quantifiable for the entire 14-day sampling 
period except for one dog where activity was apparent through day 10 but not on day 14. The 
systemic exposure to asparaginase activity in males after intravenous administration of PEG-L-
asparaginase was approximately equal (within ± 30%) to that in females after 100 IU/kg doses, 
while it was slightly greater than that in females after 500 IU/kg doses. Dog studies #4a and #4b 
found no major differences in plasma L-asparaginase levels which may be attributed to gender 
effect.  
In monkeys, the pharmacokinetics of PEG-L-asparaginase produced using two different suppliers of 
native L-asparaginase, Supplier M and Supplier K showed no apparent differences in depletion of L-
asparagine from the plasma and CSF, with plasma L-asparagine undetectable for at least 14-25 
days after i.m. administration of PEG-L-asparaginase at the dose of 2,500 IU/m2.

* one dog excluded from case sensitive parameter means (i.e. t1/2, Vss or Vz, CL), because not reliable 
estimation of elimination rate constant   
Distribution 
The observed Vss evaluated in rats and dogs corresponded to about the plasma/blood volumes in 
the  respective  species,  indicating  that  PEG-L-asparaginase  showed  a  low  propensity  to  distribute 
outside the systemic circulation (Studies #04-2861, #824-015, #824-015 and #824-016). 
Few  information  are  available  regarding  the  tissue  distribution  of  PEG-L-asparaginase  in  animals. 
Asparaginase activity was not detected in the CSF from monkeys treated with PEG-L-asparaginase 
intramuscularly (Berg, 1993 and NIH Study) that it did not cross the blood CSF barrier. 
On the other hand, as observed by Adamson, 1970, L-asparaginase activity was found in yolk sac 
fluid of pregnant rabbits receiving an i.v. dose of L-asparaginase on day 8 of pregnancy. Two hours 
after  dosing  the  asparaginase  activities  in  yolk  sac  fluid  were  about  10%  respect  to  maternal 
plasma and eight hours after dosing L-asparaginase activity increased to about 27% in relation to 
that  of  maternal  plasma  at  the  corresponding  time,  indicating  that  at  least  native  L-asparaginase 
can cross the placental barrier.

PEG-L-asparaginase  might  cross  the  placental  barrier,  although  PEGylation  interferes  with  the 
movements of large molecules through body tissues and biological barriers (Caliceti, 2003). 
The  volume  of  distribution  in  rats  and  dogs  indicates  that  PEG-L-Asparaginase  does  not  largely 
distribute outside the systemic compartment.  
No data about tissue distribution were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).  
Metabolism and Excretion 
No  studies  were  submitted  to  specifically  address  the  metabolism  and  excretion  of  PEG-L-
asparaginase (see non-clinical discussion).  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
No other pharmacokinetic studies were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).

PEG-L-asparaginase  did  not  induce  mortality  in  rats  and  dogs  up  to  500  IU/kg.  In  mice,  deaths 
occurred at 250000 IU/kg and higher. PEG-L-asparaginase induced liver toxicity especially in mice 
and  had  some  effects  on  hematology  parameters  (decreased  reticulocytes  in  dogs)  and  lymphoid 
organs (decreased spleen weight in mice).

Table 12: TK parameters from study 824-016 (dog) 
Based  on  Cmax,  animals  treated  in  the  4-week  rat  studies  and  in  the  2-week  dog  studies  were 
exposed at higher levels than clinical exposure. 
In the 4-week rat studies, several animals died from pneumonia including animals from the control 
group.  A  non-consistent  decrease  in  white  blood  cells  was  also  observed  accompanied  by  a 
decreased spleen weight without histopathology changes.  
Local Tolerance  
The local tolerability after intramuscular administration of PEG-L-asparaginase was investigated in 
a 17-week toxicity study in mouse (Study #5). Gross pathology and histopathology of the injection 
site indicated that the test material was well tolerated.   
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Study #29 was conducted according to GLP to compare the immunogenic properties of PEG-L-
asparaginase with those of native L-asparaginase. Eight mice per group were injected 525 IU/kg of 
either PEG-L-asparaginase i.p., PEG-L-asparaginase i.m. or native asparaginase i.p. for 12 weeks. 
By week 3, mice immunized with native L-asparaginase demonstrated the presence of antibodies. 
By contrast mice treated with PEG-L-asparaginase by either the i.p. or i.m. route had antibody 
titres below 1:50 throughout the study. 
Immunotoxicity 
No studies were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).  
Dependence

Other studies 
PEG- toxicity  
The presence of such vacuolations was verified in 3 studies in rat (Studies #2, #3 and #8) where 
PEG-L-asparaginase  was  given  5  days  a  week  for  4  weeks,  and  in  one  study  in  mice  (Study  #5) 
where PEG-L-asparaginase was given once a week for 13 or 17 weeks i.p. or i.m., respectively.   
During routine examination, no histopathological lesions were identified in brain or kidney.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance, PEG-L-asparaginase, is a naturally occurring protein chemically modified by 
covalent binding with monomethoxy polyethylene glycol succinimidyl succinate (SS-mPEG). 
PEGylation  of  therapeutic  proteins  is  an  established  practice  to  alter  pharmacokinetic  properties 
and  reduce  unwanted  immunogenicity  and  antigenicity  by  attachment  of  an  inert  and  hydrophilic 
polymer to the target protein. The selected polymer, polyethylene glycol, is a hydrophilic and low-
toxic  compound  which  is  used  for  a  large  variety  of  applications,  across  many  industries  (Davis, 
2002). 
The Applicant has performed a phase I calculation of the predicted environmental concentration in 
surface water (PECsw) for PEG, which resulted in a value that is lower than the action limit of 0.01 
μg/L. Therefore a Phase II ERA is not required. This is acceptable according to the Guideline on the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 
corr 21*). 
In  conclusion  PEG-L-asparaginase  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment  following  its 
prescribed use in patients. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The  PEGylation  of  L-  asparaginase  is  not  expected  to  influence  the  mechanism  of  action  of  L-
asparaginase.  Since  Oncaspar  (PEGylated  L-  asparaginase  manufactured  by  ENZON  using  native 
enzyme  produced  by  Supplier  M)  has  been  approved  and  used  in  Germany,  Poland  and  US  for 
many years, no new PD studies were carried out which is considered acceptable.  
The  submitted  non-clinical  studies  are  mainly  old  (1980s)  published  studies  and  thus  they  do  not 
comply with up to date standards. In particular, the first three studies, described in Abuchowski et 
al. 1984, employed batches produced at Rutgers University for which a complete physico-chemical 
characterization is not available. Thus, these additional (older) studies cannot support the present 
application. However, a large clinical experience exists since Oncaspar is marketed in the US and in 
Germany since 1994. Therefore no additional non-clinical studies are considered needed. 
In  studies  with  mice  inoculated  lymphoma  or  lymphosarcoma  cells,  PEG-L-asparaginase  showed 
greater  efficacy  than  native  asparaginase  at  the  same  dose.  PEG-L-asparaginase  showed  also 
greater efficacy when administered via the i.p. route than via the i.m. route. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 31/122 
 
 
  
In  studies  with  dogs  bearing  spontaneous  lymphosarcomas,  PEG-L-asparaginase  alone  or  in 
combination with chemotherapy induced complete or partial responses even in dogs that received 
prior  chemotherapy.  PEG-L-asparaginase  was  generally  well  tolerated  but  adverse  effects  were 
observed in single dogs: fatal tumour massive breakdown, disseminated intravascular coagulation, 
anaphylactic reactions. 
No  study  aimed  at  predicting  potential  off-target  effects  of  PEG-L-asparaginase  was  performed. 
However  due  to  extensive  clinical  experience,  the  toxicological  profile  in  patients  overcomes  the 
need for secondary PD evaluation for PEG-L-asparaginase. 
The  applicant  did  not  conduct  dedicated  safety  pharmacology  and  relied  on  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies and a pharmacological study. No effects on behaviour, coagulation, cardiac and respiratory 
systems were observed according to the submitted studies. 
No non-clinical PD interaction studies were submitted with Oncaspar. The Applicant has described 
the potential for pharmacodynamic interactions with other chemotherapeutic agents on the basis of 
limited published data. This is acceptable given the significant clinical experience with Oncaspar.  
Pharmacokinetics 
PEG-L-asparaginase  pharmacokinetics  were  studied  in  mice,  rats,  dogs,  rabbits  and  monkeys 
through i.v., i.m. and/or i.p. routes. 
Compared  to  native  L-asparaginase,  PEG-L-asparaginase  showed  a  longer  half-life  (2-4  days  in 
rodents  and  5-12  days  in  non-rodents),  a  greater  exposure  at  the  same  dose  and  it  seems  that 
immunisation had no effect on PEG-L-asparaginase clearance in mice. 
PEG-L-asparaginase PK profile was comparable in mice after i.v. or i.p. administration. 
The  exposure  was  dose-proportional  in  rat  and  dogs.  In  the  rat,  there  was  no  gender-related 
difference in exposure at high doses whereas male exposure was greater than female exposure at 
lower doses. In the dog, exposure was generally similar in males and females except in one study 
at high doses where male exposure was greater than female exposure at lower doses. 
After PEG-L-asparaginase administration, asparaginase activity was dose-dependent in rat and can 
be  detectable  during  a  prolonged  period  in  mice  and  rabbits.  PEG-L-asparaginase  induced  a 
prolonged  depletion  in  plasma  asparagine  levels  that  started  very  shortly  after  administration.  In 
rat, no depletion in glutamine levels was observed. 
A study in monkeys compared PEG-L-asparaginase produced using two different suppliers of native 
L-asparaginase,  Supplier  M  and  Supplier  K.  No  significant  differences  in  PK  (Cl,  AUC)  and  in  PD 
(asparagine depletion) were noted. 
The  volume  of  distribution  in  rats  and  dogs  indicates  that  PEG-L-asparaginase  does  not  largely 
distribute outside the systemic compartment. 
No  data  about  tissue  distribution  are  available.  PEG-L-asparaginase  does  not  seem  to  cross  the 
blood–CSF barrier and no data are available regarding the placental barrier.  
There are no animal studies regarding PEG-L-asparaginase metabolism and excretion. Proteins are 
expected  to  be  eliminated  by  liver  uptake,  proteolysis  or  clearance  by  the  immune  system. 
However, the latter pathway is reduced by Pegylation. PEG released from the pegylated protein is 
expected to be in majority excreted as unchanged material in urine. 
No  studies  on  PK  drug  interactions  of  PEG-L-asparaginase  were  submitted  which  is  considered 
acceptable considering available clinical data in the literature.

Toxicology 
Most of toxicology studies provided to characterize the PEG-L-asparaginase toxicological profile for 
the  present  application,  were  conducted  during  1980s  and  early  1990s,  except  two  more  recent 
GLP studies performed in 2007 (Studies #824-015 and #824-016) with PEG-L-asparaginase using 
native enzyme produced by Supplier M. 
Single dose toxicity studies with PEG-L-asparaginase did not induce mortality in rats and dogs up 
to 500 IU/kg. In mice, deaths occurred at 250000 IU/kg and higher. PEG-L-asparaginase induced 
liver  toxicity  especially  in  mice  and  had  some  effects  on  haematology  parameters  (decreased 
reticulocytes in dogs) and lymphoid organs (decreased spleen weight in mice). 
Repeat-toxicity  studies  conducted  with  PEG-L-asparaginase  indicated  effects  on  haematology 
parameters  (decreased  RBC  and  leukocyte  counts  in  rats,  decreased  leukocyte  counts  in  dogs), 
lymphoid  organs  (decreased  spleen  weight  in  rats  with  no  histological  changes)  and  liver  tissue 
(changes in histology in mice, increased liver enzymes in rats and dogs). However, animals in the 
4-week rat studies and 2-week dog studies were exposed to higher than clinical levels of the drug.  
Three  months’  studies  with  L-asparaginase  in  rats  and  dogs  induced  effects  on  the  liver  (fatty 
infiltration of the liver cells) and thymus atrophy (Lorke, 1970). 
In the 4-week rat studies, several animals died from pneumonia including animals from the control 
group.  A  non-consistent  decrease  in  white  blood  cells  was  also  observed  accompanied  by  a 
decreased spleen weight without histopathology changes. Asparaginase is described in literature as 
immunosuppressive  in  animal  studies.  With  regards  to  the  provided  data,  it  appears  difficult  to 
assess 
the 
immunosuppressive  properties 
from  a  non-clinical  point  of  view.  The 
immunosuppressive properties have been further addressed from a clinical perspective (see section 
on clinical safety). 
PEG-L-asparaginase  did  not  show  genotoxicity  in  a  non-OECD  compliant  Ames  test  and  in  a 
published study assessing its effect on karyotypes.  
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted. This is in agreement with ICH S6. 
Embryotoxicity  studies  with  L-asparaginase  have  given  evidence  of  teratogenic  potential  in  rats 
treated  from  day  6  to  15  of  gestation  with  a  No  Observed  Effect  Level  (NOEL)  for  teratogenic 
effects  at  300  U/kg  i.v.  In  rabbits  doses  of  50  or  100  U/kg  i.v.  on  days  8  and  9  of  gestation 
induced  viable  fetuses  with  congenital  malformations:  no  NOEL  has  been  determined.  Multiple 
malformations  and  embryolethal  effects  were  observed  with  doses  in  the  therapeutic  range. 
Investigations  of  the  effect  on  fertility  and  peri-  and  postnatal  development  were  not  conducted 
(see SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 and RMP). 
No studies in juvenile animals were conducted. However clinical data are available to establish the 
safety profile in the paediatric population. 
Local tolerance was investigated in mice after I.M. administration showing no gross or microscopic 
pathological changes.  
PEG-L-asparaginase  was  less  immunogenic  than  native  asparaginase  in  mice.  However,  the 
immunogenic potential should be assessed in patients and is further discussed under the section on 
clinical aspects. 
The  presence  of  vacuolated  cells  was  identified  with  several  PEGylated  proteins.  Repeated 
parenteral administration of PEGylated proteins to animals has in some cases been associated with 
cellular  vacuolation  in  macrophages  and/or  histiocytes  in  various  organs.  No  histopathological 
lesions were identified in brain or kidney in studies in rat and mice.

Given  the  expected  clearance  of  PEG  by  mammalian  metabolism  and  the  very  low  PEC 
SURFACEWATER,  the  risk  posed  to  the  environment  by  PEG  modification  to  L-asparaginase  in 
Oncaspar is negligible. A Phase II ERA is therefore not applicable for Oncaspar. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering the available clinical data and clinical experience with pegaspargase, the non-clinical 
data are considered sufficient and have been adequately reflected in the product information.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Oncaspar pharmacokinetic assessments were based on an enzymatic assay measuring 
asparaginase activity (see SmPC section 5.2). Pharmacokinetics of asparaginase was assessed 
using traditional PK sampling approaches in the following clinical studies in patients (ALL and other 
haematological malignancies):  ASP-001, ASP-302, ASP-304, CCG-1962, DFCI-87-001/ASP.301. 
Absorption  
Oncaspar is not absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract. It can be administered either by 
intramuscular or intravenous route (see SmPC section 4.2).  
In adult ALL, intravenous Oncaspar resulted in peak enzymatic activity levels and asparagine 
depletion within 2 hours after administration. Depletion was sustained for approximately 3 weeks 
with a dose of 2,000 IU/m2. In paediatric ALL patients, asparagine depletion was maintained for 
approximately 5 weeks with a dose of 2,500 IU/m2 (Douer et al, 2007; Wenner et al, 2005). In 
adults, the plasma half-life of a single 2,000 IU/m2 dose was longer than that seen in paediatric 
trials with intramuscular Oncaspar (Douer et al, 2007).  
Following intramuscular administration of Oncaspar (25,000 IU/m2), levels of activity peaked at 72-
96 hours after the administration and then declined with a t1/2 of 5.73 ± 3.24 days (Asselin et al., 
1993).   
The mean ASNase activity over time after the first 2500 IU/m2 dose of Oncaspar was evaluated in 
study CCG-1962 which is further described under clinical efficacy. In this study, the determination 
of asparaginase activity, anti-asparaginase antibodies and amino acids, blood was collected during 
induction Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and cerebrospinal fluid was collected during induction Days 0, 7 
and 28. At least four blood samples were collected from 57 patients in the Oncaspar group and 
from 45 patients in the native E coli asparaginase group. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
analyses were conducted on the samples using a one-compartment open model to fit the serum 
asparaginase enzymatic activity and asparagine concentrations. 
The absorption and elimination of Oncaspar were described by single exponential functions. The 
mean half-time of absorption from the IM injection site was 1.7 days and the elimination half-life 
was 5.5 days (132 hours). A one-compartment population analysis yielded an apparent volume of 
distribution of 1.5 L/m2. The serum half-life for native E. coli asparaginase was 1.1 days (26 
hours). 
A new PK and PD analysis report was issued on March 2006 as per FDA request. The new PK 
analysis was carried out according to NCA and evaluated just T½ and terminal rate constant 
(lambda z). The mean apparent elimination half-lives of Oncaspar after a single IM injection were 
5.79, 5.90 and 5.55 days during Induction, and Delayed Intensification 1 and 2 phases. The mean 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016

apparent elimination half-life for Oncaspar across all phases was 5.75 days which is comparable to 
values reported in the literature for Oncaspar and approximately 5 times longer than those 
reported for native E coli asparaginase. 
Distribution 
Vd was calculated in studies ASP-001, CCG-1962, and AALL07P4. Study CCG-1962 is presented 
above and the other two studies are described below. 
•  ASP-001: Vd ranged from 1.87 to 2.55 L/m2, and was not dose-dependent  
•  CCG-1962: In the first data analysis, a one-compartment population analysis yielded an apparent 
volume of distribution of 1.5 L/m2. 
•  AALL07P4: Mean Vss was 2 L at induction and 1.8 L at consolidation. 
Study ASP-001 
The objectives of this trial were to define toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated dose and 
evaluate the clinical pharmacology and efficacy of Oncaspar administered as a 1-hour infusion 
every 2 weeks. This study enrolled 37 heavily pre-treated patients (17 males, 20 females) with 
refractory haematological malignancies ranging in age from 15 to 73 years (median 49 years). The 
median duration of disease was 1.6 years and a median of 8 prior anticancer drugs had been 
received by these patients. 
The study had an open-label, ascending multiple dose design. Cohorts of 3 patients were entered 
at each dose level, starting at 500 U/m2, with subsequent cohorts at higher doses until dose-
limiting toxicity was observed. Dose was also escalated in individual patients until a biological 
effect or a dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetic 
analysis. 
Patients were eligible as follows:  
•  Male or female ≥15 years of age. 
• 
Life expectancy ≥6 weeks. 
•  Histologically  proved  leukaemia  or  other  haematological  malignancy  refractory  to  conventional 
therapeutic regimens and with evidence of measurable disease. 
Exclusion criteria were: 
•  History of pancreatitis or coagulopathy.  
•  Chemotherapy or radiation within 3 weeks prior to study start, or failure to recover from any toxic 
effect  of  previous  therapy  (including  insufficient  time  since  last  treatment  to  show  expected 
delayed toxicities). 
Patients refractive to prior native asparaginase were not excluded. The investigator was permitted 
to make exceptions to the entry criteria at his/her discretion. 
The protocol specified a starting dose was 500 IU/m2, which was conservative based on nonclinical 
data with Oncaspar and clinical experience with native asparaginase. On subsequent courses the 
dose for individual patients could be doubled if there was no evidence of response and no 
dose-limiting toxicity. If a clinically significant response was observed the patient was to receive 2 
to 4 doses at the effective dose level. In patients who experienced dose-limiting toxicity after being 
re-treated, the Oncaspar dose was reduced by 50%. Subsequent cohorts were to be started at a 
dose that had been demonstrated to be safe in cohort 1. However, rather than following protocol 
guidelines, starting doses were selected by the investigator based on clinical judgment.  
Blood samples were collected from 31 patients. There were too few samples to allow calculation of 
pharmacokinetic parameters in 4 patients. In addition, 2 patients who experienced anaphylactic 
reactions were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis due to rapid disappearance of the

Plasma versus time profile for Oncaspar was monophasic with a mean elimination half-life across 
doses of 357 (±243) hours corresponding to 14.9 (±10.1) days. Peak plasma concentrations at the 
end of infusion trough concentrations at Day 14 and AUCs were approximately proportional to the 
dose. The volume of distribution and clearance were independent of the administered dose. One-
way analysis of variance was performed to determine whether there was a significant difference in 
the half-lives across the five dose groups. Resultant F-tests showed that there were no differences 
(F=1.604; p=0.213). At the higher dose levels, 2-weekly dosing could potentially result in 
significant accumulation of asparaginase.  
Study AALL07P4 
This was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, active comparator controlled trial in patients 
(>1 year and <31 years of age at the time of diagnosis) with newly diagnosed high-risk B-
precursor ALL. Eligible patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive the experimental drug at 
a dose of 2100 IU/m2 or 2500 IU/m2 IV or Oncaspar 2500 IU/m2 IV plus full augmented BFM 
Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) multi-agent chemotherapy. It was planned to recruit 186 patients 
(62 randomised to Oncaspar).  
The study design includes a 35-day Induction period, a 2-week Extended Induction period (for 
patients with M2 marrow or marrow with ≥1% MRD), an 8-week Consolidation period, up to two 
8-week IM periods, up to two 8-week drug induction (DI) periods, and Maintenance therapy. 
Maintenance therapy consists of repeated 12-week cycles. The total duration of therapy is 2 years 
from the start of Interim Maintenance I for female patients and 3 years from the start of Interim 
Maintenance I for male patients. 
Rapid early responders (RER) received one IM and one DI phase, and those classified as slow early 
responders (SER) and/or CNS3 positive received two IM, two DI phases. PEGylated asparaginase 
was administered on Day 4 of Induction, on Day 4 of Extended Induction (if applicable), on Days

15 and 43 of Consolidation, on Days 2 and 22 of both Interim Maintenance periods, and on Days 4 
and 43 of both DI periods.  All patients had PK and PD evaluations after administration of 
randomised study drug on Days 4, 5, 6, 8, 15, 22, and 29 of Induction, and Days 15, 16, 17, 22, 
29, 36, and 43 of Consolidation. Evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD) was performed at 
induction Day 29. 
All patients were to have had a complete PK and PD evaluation after administration of calaspargase 
pegol or Oncaspar on induction Day 4 and Consolidation Day 15 until it had been determined that 
135 patients were evaluable for full PK analyses.

Means in those two tables are arithmetic means. 
Exploratory analysis of PK parameters were performed based upon age, sex, and race. There was a 
limited number of patients in each group after the stratification. The following age–related trends 
were noted across all 3 treatment groups: 
The mean Cmax appeared to be higher in the youngest age stratification (1 to <3 years) and tended 
to decrease with age in the older age stratifications. 
The  mean  Vss  appeared  to  be  the  least  in  the  youngest  age  stratification  and  tended  to  increase 
with age in the older age stratifications. 
The mean AUC values showed a tendency to be higher in the lower age stratifications. This trend 
was more apparent with AUC0-25d as compared to AUC0-∞ and AUC0-t. 
The  mean  CL  appeared  to  be  the  least  in  the  youngest  age  stratification  and  tended  to  increase 
• 
• 
• 
• 
with age in the older age stratifications. 
In the Oncaspar group, there appeared to be an age-related increase in half life. The youngest age 
stratification (1 to <3 years) had the shortest mean half-life (106 hours) with the half-life 
increasing with increasing age to a mean half-life of 156 hours in the oldest age stratification (≥16 
years). 
The overall PK-evaluable population was evenly balanced between male (n=74) and female (n=71) 
patients. There were no clear trends that would suggest gender differences in the PK of 
asparaginase activity with the exception of CL and Vss, which were slightly higher in males than in 
females. 
Most patients in the PK-evaluable population in the calaspargase pegol and Oncaspar were white 
(122/145, 84%). The limited number of patients in other race groups (10 Black or African 
American, 2 native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, with 7 unknown and 2 other, not specified) 
was too limited to support discussion of race differences on PK of asparaginase activity.

Elimination 
Excretion pathways 
During Study ASP-001, asparaginase was not detected in urine samples collected from the first 
9 patients to be studied.  
During Study ASP-301, an ELISA was used to determine whether asparaginase protein could be 
detected in the urine samples of two patients. Results showed that only extremely low levels of 
asparaginase are detectable in urine (0.15 IU in a 24-hour sample, equivalent to 0.1% of the 
administered dose). 
No human mass-balance studies were provided. 
The disappearance of L- asparaginase activity from blood is at least partly due to the distribution of 
the enzyme into the extravascular fluid and clearance via the reticuloendothelial system. In one 
study in humans, the results of serum and urine ELISA suggest that PEG-L-asparaginase activity 
and the protein were cleared by mechanisms other than urinary excretion (Asselin, 1993). Possible 
mechanisms that are consistent with the results of this study include proteolysis of the enzyme 
and/or removal by an organ other than the kidneys. Authors suggested that, although previous 
reports suggest this might not be the case, PEG-L-asparaginase may be metabolized by the liver, 
excreted in the bile, or filtered from the plasma by the RES (Asselin, 1993). 
There are no data presented on the metabolism of the PEG associated with PEGylated proteins; 
information reported in literature suggests that urinary excretion of unchanged material will be the 
major route of clearance of any PEG released by degradation of conjugate. Human excretion 
balance studies have shown that 86% and 96% of PEG 1000 and PEG 6000 were excreted into the 
urine 12 hours after an intravenous administration. Biliary excretion of unchanged material would 
be expected to be a minor route (Webster, 2007). 
Terminal half-lives 
Terminal half-lives were calculated in all the studies below.: 
•  ASP-001: T1/2 was estimated to be 357 (±243) hours, corresponding to 14.9 (±10.1) days, and 
was independent of dose. 
•  ASP-301: T1/2 was estimated to be 5.73 ± 3.24 days with all patients, or 1.82 ± 0.26 days, in 
hypersensitive patients. 
•  ASP-302:  T1/2  was  estimated  to  be  2.69  ±  1.97  days  (ranging  from  1.17  to  5.90  days)  in 
hypersensitive  patients,  and  4.83  ±  2.62  days  (ranging  from  0.79  to  17.93  days)  in 
non-hypersensitive patients. 
•  ASP-304:  T1/2  was  estimated  to  be  2.88  ±  2.40  days  in  hypersensitive  patients  (ranging  from 
0.41  to  7  days),  and  3.41  ±  1.  75  days  (ranging  from  0.91  to  6.44  days)  in  non-hypersensitive 
patients.  Clearance  was  also  faster,  and  T1/2  shorter,  in  patients  with  high  antibody  levels, 
especially those who are hypersensitive. 
•  CCG-1962: T1/2 was estimated to be 5.79 days, 5.90 days and 5.55 days during Induction, and 
Delayed Intensification 1 and 2 phases. However, there was an outlier at induction with a terminal 
half-life of 215.7 days. 
•  DFCI-87-001: T1/2 was estimated to be 5.73 ± 3.24 days. Finally, in patients with low antibody 
titres  the  mean  half-life  of  Oncaspar  was  7.05  days.  This  compared  with  a  mean  of  2.59  days  in 
high titre patients. 
•  AALL07P4: T1/2 was estimated to be 126.9 ± 50.51 hours (5.29 ± 2.10 Days) in induction phase 
and 117.2 ± 49.36 hours (4.88 ± 2.06 Days) in consolidation phase.

Comparison with other L-asparaginases: 
•  ASP-301: T1/2 of native enzyme preparations Elspar was 1.24 ± 0.17 days (mean ± SD) in the 
high-dose group and 1.35 ± 0.30 days for the low-dose group. 
•  CCG-1962: The serum half-life for native E. coli asparaginase was 1.1 days (26 hours). 
•  DFCI-87-001:  The  half-lives  for  the  3  asparaginase  preparations  were  statistically  significantly 
different, with Oncaspar (5.73 ± 3.24 days) having a much longer half-life than the native enzyme 
preparations Elspar (1.28 ± 0.35 days) and Erwiniase (0.65 ± 0.13 days). 
Study ASP-301 
The objectives of this study were to determine the half-life of 3 different asparaginase preparations 
(asparaginase activity and protein level) and to examine the effect of single dose, repeated doses 
and hypersensitivity on the half-life of serum asparaginase activity in paediatric population. The 
three asparaginases investigated were: 
•  Oncaspar 
•  Native E coli L-asparaginase (Elspar). 
•  Native Erwinia L-asparaginase. 
After obtaining informed consent, children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated intramuscularly 
according to one of two sequential treatment protocols: 
•  Between  1985  and  1987,  patients  were  randomized  to  receive  25,000  IU/m2  (high  dose)  or 
2,500  IU/  m2  (low  dose)  native  E  coli  asparaginase  as  a  single  IM  injection  on  the  first  day  of 
therapy (Day 0). 
•  Between 1987 and 1991, the randomization was between the following treatments: 
o  25,000 IU/ m2 native E coli asparaginase 
o  25,000 IU/ m2 native Erwinia asparaginase 
o  2,500 IU/ m2 Oncaspar 
On Day 5, patients received five-agent induction therapy (vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, 
methotrexate and intrathecal cytarabine). Blood samples for analysis were drawn on Days 0 to 6, 
and then every 2 to 3 days through Day 26. 
Induction therapy was followed by multiple-drug intensification therapy, featuring administration of 
intensive native E coli asparaginase 25,000 IU/m2 IM weekly for at least 20 weeks but not longer 
than 36 weeks. Intensification therapy included cranial irradiation and combination chemotherapy 
with standard agents. For middle-dose studies, blood was obtained on each of 4 or 5 days in the 
1-week interval following one of the doses of asparaginase between the third and fifteenth dose. 
Blood samples for last-dose studies were obtained in the same manner following the final dose of 
asparaginase (usually the 20th to 36th dose of weekly asparaginase). 
Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected from two patients for 6 days following a single dose 
of 25,000 IU/ m2 native E coli asparaginase, concentrated approximately 15 times, and tested by 
ELISA. 
Effect of dose on serum asparaginase activity: 
In the first part of the study, 17 patients received high-dose native E coli asparaginase 
(25,000 IU/m2) and 16 patients were treated with the lower dose of 2,500 IU/m2. The decrease in 
serum asparaginase activity after the initial dose is shown in the figure below. The regression 
equation was calculated for Days 2-12 and Days 2-8 for high-dose and low-dose, respectively.

( 2,500 UI/m2;  25,000 UI/m2) (ASP-301) 
The correlation coefficient was highly significant for both regression lines (r=0.99). The doses 
administered differed by one order of magnitude and the extrapolated maximum serum levels 
(y-intercept) also differed by approximately an order of magnitude. For both groups, the peak 
serum level was achieved at 24 to 48 hours. Asparaginase activity was no longer detectable in sera 
by Day 10 (low-dose group) or Day 14 (high-dose group). The limit of detection for the assay was 
0.01 IU/mL. 
The serum half-lives were 1.24 ± 0.17 days (mean ± SD) in the high-dose group and 1.35 ± 
0.30 days for the low-dose group. The between-group difference in half-life was not statistically 
significant (p=0.2). 
The calculated half-lives for patients in each group were examined for the effect of age, sex and 
risk-category classification according to Clavell et al, 1986. No difference in apparent T½ was seen 
for patients aged <2 years as compared with those aged ≥2 years (p>0.2).  Similarly, there was 
no difference in T½ according to gender (p>0.5) or standard risk vs high risk or vs very high risk 
(p>0.15). 
Apparent T½ of asparaginase protein: 
Sera from eight patients were examined by both the activity assay and ELISA for protein 
determination. Five of these patients received high-dose asparaginase while the other three were 
randomised to the low dose. Similar to the enzyme activity, asparaginase protein was no longer 
detectable in sera by Day 9 in the low-dose group or by Day 14 in the high dose group. A log-linear 
rate of decrease in serum levels was observed for both the asparaginase activity and the protein 
itself. Mean half-lives calculated for each group are shown in the table below.

There was no statistically significant difference between the T½ of the immunologically detectable 
asparaginase molecule compared with the enzymatic activity. 
An ELISA was used to determine whether asparaginase protein could be detected in the urine 
samples of two patients. Results showed that only extremely low levels of asparaginase are 
detectable in urine (0.15 IU in a 24-hour sample, equivalent to 0.1% of the administered dose). 
Effect of repeated doses on serum asparaginase activity: 
The serum asparaginase activity were determined in blood samples collected over the time in 
patients receiving single and multiple doses of E. coli asparaginase. The mean T½ of the first dose 
of native E coli asparaginase for 9 patients was 1.21 days (SD ± 0.17 days). 
The T½ in these same 9 patients was re-assessed during intensification after 1-14 previous doses. 
The mean T½ after repeated doses was 1.28 days (± 0.35 days). There was no statistically 
significant difference between these half-lives (p=0.7). 
Serum asparaginase was then measured following the final (20th - 30th) intensification 
asparaginase dose. The mean T½ after the final dose was 1.14 days (± 0.28 days). Again, there 
were no statistically significant differences between the half-life after the first dose (p=0.3) or after 
middle doses (p=0.4). 
Effect of asparaginase preparation of serum asparaginase activity: 
In the second part of the study, the pharmacokinetics of the 3 different asparaginases were 
compared (n=10 for each asparaginase preparation). 
For native Erwinia asparaginase, serum activity levels were highest at initial sampling within 24 
hours after the dose and were no longer detectable by Day 7. The mean and standard deviation of 
T½ was 0.65 ± 0.13 days. This is significantly shorter than the T½ for native E coli asparaginase 
(p<0.001). 
For Oncaspar, asparaginase activity was measurable in the serum for the entire 26-day observation 
period. Peak levels of activity were measured at 72-96 hours after the dose, which is slightly later 
than seen with native E coli asparaginase. The mean and standard deviation for T½ of enzyme 
activity for Days 4-26 was 5.73 ± 3.24 days, significantly greater than the T½ for native E coli 
asparaginase (p<0.001). 
The decrease in serum activity was log-linear for all 3 enzymes during the initial 14-day 
observation period (see the figure below):

25,000 IU/ m2; () IM Erwinia 25,000 IU/ m2 or () or IM Oncaspar° 25,000 IU/ m2 (ASP-301) 
For 7 patients treated with Oncaspar, there were enough time points studied to allow calculation of 
the serum T½ between Days 4-14 and Days 15-26 separately. The mean ± SD T½ was 6.86 ± 
3.08 days and 2.99 ± 1.57 days for Days 4-14 and Days 15-26, respectively. Thus, the early T½ 
was significantly longer than the later T½ (p=0.001). 
Serum asparaginase activity following hypersensitivity reaction: 
Ten patients with known hypersensitivity to E. coli asparaginase were studied. Five patients had 
one or more asparaginase level(s) obtained in the week following an apparent hypersensitivity 
reaction: 1 with urticaria, 1 with a few hives and 3 with a minor local reaction of redness, swelling 
and pain at the injection site. Two of these patients were tested 1 day after the dose and in these 
patients the serum asparaginase activity levels were unusually low at 0.58 IU/mL and 0.05 IU/mL. 
The second of these patients was also tested on Day 3 when serum asparaginase activity was 
found not to be detectable (<0.01 IU/mL). In 2 further patients tested on Day 3 and on Days 6 and 
7, respectively, serum asparaginase activity was not detectable. Only in 1 patient tested on Day 7 
the asparaginase level was within the usual range (0.09 IU/mL). Therefore, in this group of 5 
patients asparaginase activity was markedly decreased when compared with predicted values in six 
of seven samples drawn between 1 and 7 days following the suspected reaction. 
Five patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to the native E. coli preparation were 
studied following a dose of Oncaspar. As shown in the table below, enzyme activity decreased, with 
an apparent T½ of 1.82 ± 0.26 days. This terminal half-life is significantly shorter than that 
observed in patients treated with Oncaspar who had not previously received any form of 
asparaginase (p<0.01).

Study ASP-302 
The purpose of this study was to obtain pharmacokinetic and long-term safety data on Oncaspar. It 
was conducted in 21 relapsed ALL patients (13 male, 8 female) ranging in age from 1 to 35 years 
old. Four of the male patients were known to be hypersensitive to native asparaginase prior to 
study participation. 
The study had an open-label design and was conducted in 3 phases: 
•  Phase I: Early therapy. 
•  Phase II: Re-induction therapy. 
•  Phase III: Remission therapy / maintenance. 
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had evidence of bone marrow relapse during or after 
treatment with multi-agent rotational chemotherapy. Patients were excluded if they had a history 
of life-threatening sensitivity to VM-26 (teniposide). A known hypersensitivity to other (non-
PEGylated) forms of L-asparaginase did not exclude a patient from participation. 
Oncaspar was administered IM at 2,500 IU/ m2 every 2 weeks during re-induction and remission 
therapy (a total of 29 doses) as part of a multi-drug chemotherapeutic regimen.  
Blood samples were collected for 11 of the 21 total patients, 2 of whom were hypersensitive. 
Evaluations were performed after either a single dose (n=6) or 2 doses (n=5) according to a 
non-compartmental approach. T½ and AUC from time 0 to infinity were calculated.  
The means and standard deviations of the data set are summarised in the table below according to 
hypersensitivity status.

Study ASP-304 
The objectives of the study were to compare the efficacy and toxicity of Oncaspar administration 
with that of native E coli-derived L-asparaginase when used as part of a standard combination

chemotherapy re-induction regimen in children with ALL who are in second hematologic relapse. 
The pharmacokinetic objectives were to determine the drug half-life for each product. In addition, 
antibodies to L-asparaginase were monitored in all patients.  
•  Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they met the following criteria: 
•  Diagnosis of ALL before age 21 years and in the second haematological relapse. 
•  Life expectancy ≥4 weeks. 
•  Adequate hepatic and renal function (SGPT <200 IU/L; creatinine <2 mg/dL). 
Exclusion criteria were as follows:  
•  Presence  of  CNS  disease  (unless  the  investigator  judged  it  appropriate  to  withhold  intrathecal 
chemotherapy during the 4 weeks of Oncaspar° combination chemotherapy; intrathecal medication 
could be given with the screening lumbar puncture at the discretion of the physician). 
•  Failure of other induction regimens which contained L-asparaginase.  
Patients without a history of hypersensitivity to native asparaginase (E coli or Erwinia) were 
randomised to receive either Oncaspar or native E coli-derived L-asparaginase (Elspar). Patients 
with known hypersensitivity to native enzyme were directly assigned to treatment with Oncaspar. 
The asparaginase treatment schedules were as follows:  
•  Oncaspar: 2,500 IU/ m2 by intramuscular route on Day 1 and Day 15 (2 doses in total). 
•  Elspar: 10,000 IU/ m2 by intramuscular route 3 times per week for 26 days (12 doses in total). 
In common with the other pre-authorisation clinical trials, the Oncaspar used in Study ASP-304 
was predominantly manufactured using asparaginase sourced from Supplier M. However, in this 
trial 7 patients were treated with Oncaspar manufactured using the Supplier K asparaginase (the 
source for commercial Oncaspar under the German and Polish MAs). 
The protocol allowed patients assigned to Oncaspar to continue into maintenance therapy with 
Oncaspar at the discretion of the physician. Patients assigned to Elspar were also allowed to 
continue maintenance therapy with Oncaspar following a protocol amendment. 
Plasma concentrations of L-asparaginase and anti-asparaginase antibody titres, were ascertained 
prior to administration of Oncaspar and on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. It was originally 
planned to measure plasma asparagine concentrations at the same time points but this was not 
done because the necessary sample preparation procedures could not be performed by the study 
personnel. 
A total of 76 patients participated in the study (47 male, 29 female). Of these, 16 completed the 
trial. The remaining patients were taken out from the study for the following reasons: 
•  Progressive disease (n=27).  
•  Relapse (n=18).  
•  Bone marrow transplant (n=7).  
•  Death (n=4).  
•  Toxicities (n=3).  
•  Refusal of further therapy (n=1).

Mean values for all parameters were lower for hypersensitive patients than for the non-
hypersensitive group. The AUC for the hypersensitive population was close to half that for non-
hypersensitive patients (5.52 IU*d/mL vs 9.27 IU*d/mL). 
Experimental  parameters  such  as  AUClast,  Tmax  and  Cmax  were  calculated  for  all  the  available 
patients,  T½ data  were  extrapolated  could  not  be  calculated  for  18  of the  hypersensitive  patients 
and for 7 of the non-hypersensitive group. The reasons for this were: 
•  Too few samples available (n=14).  
•  No terminal elimination phase due to curve plateau (n=6).  
•  No terminal elimination phase due to curve dropping rapidly (n=5).

This study investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of native E. 
coli L-asparaginase (Elspar), native Erwinia L-asparaginase (Erwiniase) and Oncaspar. The 
population studied was children with ALL on treatment protocols that included intramuscular 
asparaginase during remission induction and/or for at least 20 weeks after achieving remission. 
Children were treated according to one of a series of Dana Faber Cancer Institute (DFCI) or

Paediatric Oncology Group (POG) treatment protocols between 1987 and 1995. Between 1987 and 
1991, patients treated under DFCI protocol 87-001 were randomised to receive one of the 3 study 
drugs as a single intramuscular injection on the first day of therapy as part of a 5-day investigative 
window. Doses administered were as follows:  
•  Elspar: 25,000 IU/m2. 
•  Erwiniase: 25,000 IU/m2. 
•  Oncaspar: 2,500 IU/m2. 
Serial serum samples were taken throughout the 26-day induction period. 
Induction therapy was followed by multiple drug intensification therapy featuring intramuscular 
administration of Elspar (25,000 IU/m2) weekly for at least 20 weeks. For middle and last doses, 
blood was obtained on each of 4 or 5 days in the 1-week dosing interval. A "middle dose" was 
defined as between the 3rd and 15th dose. The final dose was usually the 20th to 30th 
administration. 
Asparaginase activity levels, asparagine concentrations and anti-asparaginase antibodies were 
analysed in study samples. The half-life data for the 3 study drugs are presented in the table 
below.

The data on Elspar serum asparaginase half-life as a function of repeated dosing (n=9) were also 
provided. The mean half-lives for first, middle and final doses were 1.28, 1.21, and 1.14 days, 
respectively. The differences were not statistically significant (p>0.3). 
In patients with low antibody titres the mean half-life of Oncaspar was 7.05 days. This compared 
with a mean of 2.59 days in high titre patients (p=0.0003). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Information about dose proportionality was provided from Study ASP-001. The volume of 
distribution and clearance were independent of the administered dose. Doses ranged from 500 
IU/m2 to 8,000 IU/m2 given intravenously every two weeks. In 25 of 37 patients, the median half-
life was 11.1 days and dose proportionality was observed.  
One-way analysis of variance was performed to determine whether there was a significant 
difference in the half-lives across the five dose groups. Resultant F-tests showed that there were 
no differences (F=1.604; p=0.213). 
In study ASP-301, for 7 patients treated with Oncaspar, there were enough time points studied to 
allow calculation of the serum T½ between Days 4-14 and Days 15-26 separately. The mean ± SD 
T½ was 6.86 ± 3.08 days and 2.99 ± 1.57 days for Days 4-14 and Days 15-26, respectively. Thus, 
the early T½ was significantly longer than the later T½ (p=0.001). 
Model and Simulation 
For study AALL07P4, a population pharmacokinetic (Pop PK) model was developed to describe the 
pharmacokinetics of Oncaspar, the factors affecting the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters

in this population, and to simulate single and steady state peak concentrations (Cmax) and 
exposure (AUC). A 2-compartment model with nonlinear clearance was found to be the best model 
for Oncaspar.

Simulations were performed using the subjects in the model building dataset. The new virtual 
subjects were created by using each subject’s unique covariate values at each treatment visit. 
The asparaginase activity versus time profiles were generated following administration of Oncaspar 
on day 4 (day 0 on the plots) of induction therapy and days 15 (46 day interval) and 43 (28 day 
interval) of consolidation therapy. The results showed that the asparaginase activity for Oncaspar 
drops off rapidly.  
The asparaginase activities versus time profiles were generated following multiple Oncaspar doses 
in order to estimate the asparaginase activity at steady state. The asparaginase activity was 
simulated for 1.7 years after 15 monthly (every 28 days) doses for the same dose levels as above. 
This long time period for the simulation was needed to estimate the AUC(0-inf) at steady state for a 
different PEG-asparaginase drug that would be compared to Oncaspar in this study. Results showed 
that with this dosing interval and duration, a little accumulation was apparent for Oncaspar. 
The AUC and Cmax values at steady state were also determined from the simulated data. The 
results are summarised in the table below.

Population PK analysis showed that children and adolescents exhibited a significantly lower volume 
of distribution normalized to BSA when compared to adults (1.05 vs 2.94 L/m2). On the other 
hand, the volume of distribution normalized to BSA remains stable for adults up to about 80 years 
of age. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-subject variability of PK parameters was large, including variability due to the differences 
between hypersensitive and non-hypersensitive patients. The CVs (%) found by parameters 
throughout the clinical studies were: 
•  T1/2: between 14.3% and 98.5% (excluding the extremely high CV at induction in study CCG-
1962 due to an outlier, already discussed), 
•  AUC: between 22.2% and 120.2%, 
•  Cmax: between 19.7% and 62.1%. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
•  No specific pharmacokinetic drug-interaction studies have been submitted (see clinical 
pharmacology discussion).

The in vivo early leukaemic cell kill using different formulation of L-asparaginase in children with 
newly-diagnosed ALL was determined in Study ASP-301 by the use of rhodamine-123 (RH-123). 
The results are shown in the following table.

Pharmacodynamic interactions 
•  Methotrexate 
Study ASP 102 investigated the use of sequential methotrexate and native L-asparaginase. The 
antitumor activity of the combination of methotrexate and native L-asparaginase was dose 
dependent. Pharmacokinetics synergy occurred when native L-asparaginase is administered 24 
hours after methotrexate.  
No studies have been submitted to determine the safety and optimal dose of methotrexate in 
combination with PEG-asparaginase. 
Additional analysis: PK/PD comparison between the Supplier L and Supplier M product 
A PK/PD analysis is ongoing to assess the PK comparability between the Supplier L and Supplier M 
product, among other objectives. Details regarding the PK/PD analysis are reported hereafter. 
Objectives 
This analysis is conducted in three parts: an assessment of the PK, an assessment of PD and an 
assessment of the immunogenicity. 
Study used in the analysis 
Details of the studies used to develop the PK model in this analysis are provided in the below table. 
All studies were open label clinical trials.

Datasets 
Study data which are utilized in the PK analysis include dosing histories (amounts, frequencies, 
dates and times of dosing), ASN activity (PK) and ASP (PD) with corresponding sample collection 
dates and times, demographic descriptors and laboratory values. 
Pharmacokinetic Model Database 
In order to examine potential PK differences between native ASN and PEG-ASN, the PK data 
obtained from study CCG-1962 which evaluated both types of ASN are used. In order to examine 
potential PK differences between Supplier M and Supplier L formulations of PEG-ASN, the PK data 
obtained from Study AALL07P4 (Supplier M formulation) and the Dana Farber study (Supplier L) 
formulation are used. 
Pharmacokinetic Pharmacodynamic Model Database 
In order to examine potential PKPD differences between native ASN and PEG-ASN, the PK and PD 
data obtained from study CCG-1962 which evaluated both types of ASN are used. PK and PD data 
from Study AALL07P4 may be used to supplement if needed. 
Immunogenicity Model Database 
In order to examine potential differences in the immunogenicity between native ASN and PEG-ASN, 
immunogenicity data obtained from study CCG-1962 which evaluated both types of ASN are used. 
In order to examine potential immunogenicity differences between Supplier M and Supplier L 
formulations of PEG-ASN, the PK data obtained from Study AALL07P4 (Supplier M formulation) and 
the Dana Farber study (Supplier L) formulation are used. 
Patient Descriptors and Laboratory Data 
Selected covariates are evaluated as possible predictors for the population PK and PK/PD models.

Table 32: Summary of Categorical Covariates and Data Items 
Interim results were provided and showed there were no differences in the asparaginase activity 
between the Supplier M and versions of Oncaspar. This was demonstrated graphically and by single 
covariate models that showed a decrease in the objective function of <3.5 points. Total bilirubin 
concentration was found to be a predictor of central volume of distribution (V1), increasing bilirubin 
concentration resulted in larger V1. BSA is a predictor of V1 and Vmax. Covariate evaluation of the 
model showed that gender and race did not affect PK parameters. Immunogenicity status was not 
associated with changes in asparaginase activity. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile of Oncaspar was assessed in patients with ALL or other haematological 
malignancies. Analytical validation reports were provided with satisfactory results taking into 
account the dates of the studies, except for some validation reports missing. General methods 
have been applied and considered acceptable for PK parameters calculation and statistical 
analyses. 
The distribution volume was in the range of the estimated plasma volume. After a one-hour 
intravenous infusion, asparaginase activity was detected for at least 15 days after the first 
treatment with Oncaspar (see SmPC section 5.2). 
In adults with leukaemia, the initial enzymatic activity after intravenous adminstration of Oncaspar 
was proportional to the dose. The elimination half-life from the plasma was between 1 and 6 days 
and appeared to be unaffected by the dose. It was also independent of age, sex, body surface 
area, renal and hepatic function, diagnosis and severity of the illness. However, terminal half-life 
was shorter in hypersensitive patients than in non-hypersensitive patients, and may be decreased 
due to the formation of high levels of anti-drug antibodies (see SmPC section 5.2). Oncaspar had a 
terminal half-life shorter in high antibody level patients than in low-antibody-level patients. 
Results from population PK analysis and simulations suggested that asparaginase activity after 
2500 IU/m2 Oncaspar administration every 28 days, as during consolidation therapy in the newly 
diagnosed high risk ALL population, underwent minimal and negligible accumulation. With a dosing 
scheme of an injection every 14 day, accumulation is expected in patients where the terminal half-
life is the longest, i.e. non-hypersensitive low-antibody level patients. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters showed a rather large inter-subject variability, including variability 
between hypersensitive and non-hypersensitive patients. Intra-subject variability was moderate.

L-asparaginase half-life after administration of Oncaspar was found to be statistically different from 
the half-life after administration of Elspar or Erwiniase. Patients with newly diagnosed ALL received 
a single intramuscular injection of Oncaspar (2500 U/m² body surface area) or native asparaginase 
from E. coli (25000 U/m² body surface area) or from Erwinia (25000 U/m² body surface area).  
The plasma elimination half-life of Oncaspar was statistically significantly longer (5.7 days) than 
the plasma elimination half-lives of the native asparaginases from E. coli (1.3 days) and Erwinia 
(0.65 days). The immediate cell death of leukaemic cells in vivo, measured by rhodamine 
fluorescence, was the same for all three L-asparaginase preparations (see SmPC section 5.2). 
ALL patients with several relapses were treated either with Oncaspar or with native asparaginase 
from E. coli as part of an induction therapy. Oncaspar was given in a dose of 2500 U/m² body 
surface intramuscularly on days 1 and 15 of induction. The mean plasma half-life of Oncaspar was 
8 days in non- hypersensitive patients (AUC 10.35 U/ml/day), and 2.7 days in hypersensitive 
patients (AUC 3.52 U/ml/day) (see SmPC section 5.2). 
There were no human mass-balance studies. However, as stated in the guideline on the clinical 
investigation of the pharmacokinetics of therapeutic proteins (CHMP/EWP/89249/2004), 
mass-balance studies for therapeutic proteins are not useful for determining the excretion pattern 
of the drug. There was no excretion of oncaspar in urine. This is consistent with the fact that 
pegaspargase is a protein with a high molecular weight. No change of pharmacokinetic of Oncaspar 
in patients with renal impairment is foreseen and thus no dose adjustment is necessary in patients 
with renal impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Reduced hepatic function may decrease the lack of elimination of a protein for which hepatic 
degradation is an important pathway, such as Pegaspargase. While the exact role of the liver in the 
metabolism of asparaginase is unknown, there is no realistic scope for decreases in liver function to 
present clinically relevant problems in the use of Oncaspar. Since the proteolytic enzymes 
responsible for oncaspar metabolism are ubiquitously distributed in tissues the exact role of the 
liver is unknown. However any decrease in liver function is not expected to present clinical relevant 
problems in the use of Oncaspar. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic 
impairment (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
No impact of genetic polymorphism is expected. 
There was little documentation about the influence of gender and race on pegaspargase 
pharmacokinetics. No effect was seen in the only study it was studied, and no effect is foreseen. 
Posology of pegaspargase is already dependant on body surface area (BSA). No other investigation 
on the effect of weight was performed or needed. 
The incidence of ALL by age has a bimodal distribution, with peaks around 2-3 years of age and 
50 years of age, therefore knowledge of those two special populations is crucial. The 
pharmacokinetic part of this application comes in vast majority from a paediatric or teenager 
population, in consequence, PK was mostly documented in children. The recommended posology is 
82.5 IU/kg body weight for children with a body surface area < 0.6 m². This was justified with data 
of previous use, and is usual in the paediatric oncology community (see also discussion on dose 
finding studies). 
There  is  limited  data  available  for  patients  older  than  65  years.  There  is  no  PK  data  available  for 
elderly patients (see SmPC section 5.2 and RMP). 
Population PK analysis showed that children and adolescents exhibited a significantly lower volume 
of distribution normalized to BSA when compared to adults (1.05 vs 2.94 L/m2). On the other 
hand, the volume of distribution normalized to BSA remained stable for adults up to about 80 years 
of age. Unless otherwise prescribed, the recommended posology in adults aged >21 years is 2000 
U/m2 every 14 days (see SmPC section 4.2).

Regarding pharmacodynamic effects, pharmacodynamics was assessed in Study 1 in 57 newly 
diagnosed paediatric patients with standard-risk ALL who received three intramuscular doses of 
Oncaspar (2500 Units/m2), one each during induction and two delayed intensification treatment 
phases.  Pharmacodynamic activity was assessed through serial measurements of asparagine in 
sera (n=57) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n=50) (see SmPC section 5.1).  The results are 
presented and discussed under clinical efficacy. 
No formal analysis of drug interactions occurring in the clinical trial program was submitted. 
Furthermore, no clinical pharmacology studies which formally investigated drug-drug interaction 
potential was submitted. There is no potential for drug-food interaction known. Potential 
interactions that are well known for asparaginase are further discussed below and reflected 
accordingly in section 4.5 of the SmPC and in the Risk Management plan.  
The decrease in serum proteins caused by Oncaspar can increase the toxicity of other medicinal 
products that are protein bound. 
In addition, by inhibiting protein synthesis and cell division, Oncaspar can disturb the mechanism 
of action of other substances which require cell division for their effect, e.g. methotrexate. 
Methotrexate and cytarabine can interfere differently: prior administration of these substances can 
increase the action of Oncaspar synergistically. If these substances are given subsequently, the 
effect of Oncaspar can be weakened antagonistically. 
Oncaspar can interfere with enzymatic detoxification of other medicinal products, especially in the 
liver. 
The use of Oncaspar can lead to fluctuating coagulation factors. This can promote the tendency to 
bleeding and/or thrombosis. Caution is therefore needed when anticoagulants such as coumarin, 
heparin, dipyridamole, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are given 
concomitantly. 
When glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisone) and Oncaspar are given at the same time, alterations in 
coagulation parameters (e.g. fall in fibrinogen and Antithrombin III deficiency, ATIII) can be more 
pronounced. 
Immediately preceding or simultaneous treatment with vincristine can increase the toxicity of 
Oncaspar and increases the risk of anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, vincristine should be given in 
a timely manner before administration of Oncaspar in order to minimise toxicity. 
An indirect interaction cannot be ruled out between pegaspargase and oral contraceptives due to 
pegaspargase hepatotoxicity that may impair the hepatic clearance of oral contraceptives. 
Therefore, the combination of Oncaspar with oral contraception is not recommended. Another 
method than oral contraception shoud be used in women of childebearing potential (see sections 
4.4 and 4.6). 
Simultaneous vaccination with live vaccines increases the risk of severe infections attributable to 
the immunosuppressive activity of Oncaspar and overall situation taking into account the 
underlying disease and the usually combined chemotherapy (see section 4.4). Vaccination with live 
vaccines should therefore be given 3 months at the earliest after termination of the entire 
antileukaemic treatment. 
De-PEGylation occurs over the course of PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) drug storage due to hydrolytic 
cleavage of the labile ester bond on the succinimidyl succinate polyethylene glycol (SS-PEG) linker. 
The drug product shelf life is limited to 8 months (see section on quality). An analysis was 
performed in Study AALL07P4 to determine whether there is a relationship between drug age at 
induction and clinical outcomes (data not shown). Since no assay was performed during stability 
studies, data on the extent of protein PEGylation at the time of dosing in study AALL07P4 are not 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 58/122 
 
 
  
available. However, indirect data on the extent of de-PEGylation could be obtained considering the 
difference between total free PEG measured at batch release and during the stability study. 
Overall, the provided data do not suggest any significant relationship between de-PEGylation and 
clinical outcomes, especially considering the proposed 8-month shelf-life. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data are considered sufficient and have been adequately reflected in the 
product information. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Oncaspar dosing and scheduling were first investigated in two studies (ASP-001 and ASP-102), in 
which, overall, a dose range of 500-8000 IU/m2 IV every 14 days was administered. 
ASP-001 was a phase I-II trial, conducted from 1984 to 1986 in order to evaluate the clinical 
pharmacology and efficacy of PEG-ASNase in malignant hematologic disorders, using an open-
label, ascending multiple dose design. Cohorts of 3 patients were entered at each dose level, 
starting at 500 IU/m2, which was conservative based on non-clinical data with PEG-ASNase and 
clinical experience with native ASNase, with subsequent cohorts at higher doses until dose-limiting 
toxicity was observed. Dose was also escalated in individual patients until a biological effect or a 
dose-limiting toxicity was observed. In total, 37 heavily pre-treated patients were enrolled and the 
distribution of first and final PEG-ASNase doses in the study is reported in the table below. 
Table 37: First and last Oncaspar dose levels – study ASP-001 
A preliminary assessment of efficacy showed 3 CR (1 ALL patient, 2 NHL patients) and 2 SD (1 
myeloma patient and 1 ALL patient). 
ASP-102 was a phase I, open-label, non-comparative trial conducted from 1987 to 1988 in patients 
with refractory solid tumours and lymphomas designed to investigate the maximally tolerated dose 
of Methotrexate when followed by PEG-ASNase, to determine a suitable PEG-ASNase dose for 
Phase II studies and to assess its activity. Five cohorts of 3 patients each were to be treated with 
ascending doses of Methotrexate (4 administrations every 6 hours), followed within 24 hours by an 
IM administration of 2.000 IU/m2 PEG-ASNase (subsequently reduced at 1.000 IU/m2 due to 
toxicity). The study accrued 11 patients, including 6 patients with breast cancer and 1 each with 
sarcoma of the spinal cord, common bile duct cancer, rectal cancer, ovarian cancer and NHL. Nine 
of the 11 patients were evaluated for clinical response. Five of them (56%) exhibited stable disease 
and 4 (44%) had progressive disease. Methotrexate was tolerated at doses ranging from 40 to 60 
Assessment report

mg/m2 when followed within 24 hours by 1,000 IU/m2 of Oncaspar. The maximum tolerated dose 
for Methotrexate when followed by 1,000 IU/m2 of Oncaspar was observed at 60 mg/m2.  
Dose information from other studies 
In all the pivotal studies supporting the first-line indication (CCG-1961, CCG-1962, DFCI-87-001 
and DFCI-91-01) PEG-ASNase was administered at the dose of 2.500 UI/m2 IM as single injection 
or every 2 weeks. The actual timing of administration differed widely between studies since PEG-
ASNase was just a single component of complex multidrug treatments.  
In the eight studies supporting the second-line indication, also including non-hypersensitive 
patients, PEG-ASNase was mainly administered at 2.000 – 2.500 IU/m2 IM every 2 weeks.  
Clinical response rates were higher at 2,000 IU/m2 in comparison to 2,500 IU/m2. However, the 
majority of data relating to the 2,000 IU/m2 dose (n=32 out of 51) came from Study ASP-
001C/003C in which PEG-ASNase could be given up to once weekly as opposed to every 2 weeks. 
Therefore, while the single actual dose administered may have been lower, the absolute amount of 
drug received during all the study period might have even exceeded that administered in most 
studies where PEG-ASNase was used at the dose of 2,500 IU/m2 every 2 weeks.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy data are presented for the first line indication, i.e. newly diagnosed patients never 
treated for their disease and second line indication, i.e. patients with one relapse/treatment failure, 
separately.  
First-line indication 
The efficacy results of four clinical trials (CCG-1961, CCG-1962, DFCI-87-001, DFCI-91-01) were 
submitted by the Applicant in support of the PEG-ASNase administration in first-line indication. 
Study CCG-1961: Treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with unfavourable 
features: A Phase III Group-wide Study. 
CCG-1961 was submitted in the format of bibliographical references: 
Grigoryan et al (2004): this publication reports on changes of amino acid serum levels in response 
to asparaginase therapy. Samples were collected from 1001 patients but only a subset of 73 
patients was randomly selected for analysis. No clinical efficacy endpoint data were reported. 
Panosyan et al (2004): the authors investigated anti-asparaginase antibodies and asparaginase 
enzymatic activity in the sera of 1001 patients. They presented an interim analysis of 280 patients 
followed for 30 months showing an association between antibody positivity and an increased rate 
of events. 
Seibel et al (2008): In this report 1299 patients with marrow blasts ≤25% on Day 7 of induction 
were defined rapid early responders (RER). These patients were randomly assigned in a 2x 2 
factorial design trial to standard or longer duration post-induction intensification (PII) and to 
standard or increased intensity PII. The effect on EFS after 5 years was reported. 
Nachman et al (2009): The authors investigated outcomes and proposed prognostic factors in a 
sub-population of CCG-1961 composed by 262 young adults (aged 16-21 years). EFS data 
following 5 years of follow-up are presented. 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from study CCG-1961 supporting the present 
application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

With respect to data from Panosyan et al., 61% of patients after exposure to native E.coli L-
asparaginase in induction showed at least one anti-asparaginase antibody positivity throughout all 
the treatment, while 39% had persistently no detectable antibodies. Once high-titre Ab-positivity 
appeared, generally it persisted throughout the all the treatment. 
The table below presents the Ab-positive ratio values over negative control per phase of treatment. 
Table 39: Average antibody titers over negative control per treatment phase for antibody positive 
patients 
No anticipated asparaginase activity was detected in 81 of 88 Ab-positive patients (thus, 94% 
neutralizing activity). The largest subset of patients developed anti-asparaginase antibody 
positivity and had obvious clinical allergy symptoms (115/280; 41%). These patients were 
switched to Erwinia asparaginase, which did not cross-react with anti-E. coli asparaginase antibody. 
In patients with no clinical signs of hypersensitivity and therefore not switched to Erwinia 
asparaginase), but with an anti-asparaginase antibody-positive status (81/280; 29%), the 
presence of antibodies reduced or completely negated asparaginase enzymatic activity. 
Study CCG-1962: A Randomised comparison of PEG-L-Asparaginase and Native E. coli 
Asparaginase in the standard treatment arm of CCG-1952 for standard-risk acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia, a Phase II Limited Institution Pilot Study. 
This was a multicenter, randomized study conducted as a sub-study of CCG-1952 designed to 
determine the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of PEG-ASNase compared with standard 
native ASNase as part of combination therapy in children with newly diagnosed SR-ALL.

Treatments 
The treatment used in the study is outlined in the table below. At the start of induction, patients 
were randomly assigned to receive either: 
•  Oncaspar (2,500 IU/m2 i.m.) on Day 3 of Induction and Day 3 of each Delayed Intensification. 
•  Native E coli asparaginase (6,000 IU/m2 i.m.) 3 times weekly for 9 doses during induction and 
for 6 doses during each delayed intensification phase.

Objectives 
Primary objectives: 
1. To compare, in a randomised fashion, the safety of PEG-ASNase and native ASNase 
administered in induction and in DI phases #1 and #2 in children with newly diagnosed SR-ALL. 
2. To determine, in a randomised fashion, whether the incidence of high-titer anti-ASNase 
antibodies in children treated with PEG-ASNase was decreased by at least 50% compared with 
children treated with native ASNase in DI phase #1. 
Secondary objectives: 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 65/122 
 
 
  
 
1. To determine, as a secondary endpoint, whether the incidence of high-titer anti-ASNase 
antibodies in children treated with PEG-ASNase was decreased by at least 50% compared with 
children treated with native ASNase in DI phase #2. 
2. To determine the duration that serum ASNase levels remained > 0.03 IU/mL and serum ASN 
concentration remained < 1 μM in children treated with PEG-ASNase or native ASNase in Induction 
and in DI phases #1 and #2. 
3. To compare pharmaco-economic data from PEG-ASNase with native ASNase in induction and 
both DI phases. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the incidence of high-titre asparaginase antibodies in Delayed 
Intensification #1. The objective was to determine if a greater than 50% reduction in high-titer 
ASNase antibodies could be observed in PEG-ASNase compared with native ASNase in DI #1. High-
titer antibody was defined as a level of antibody 2.5 times the average control level. Based on 
available data, the average antibody level for normal subjects and for patients before ASNase 
therapy was considered to be 2 U/mL, similar to that reported by Cheung et al. Consequently, 
high-titer antibody was defined as a level of 5 U/mL or greater and was used as the primary 
outcome index in the trial. 
Secondary endpoints were comparison of the two treatment arms for incidence of antibodies in DI 
#2; ASNase activity, ASNase protein, and ASN levels in serum during Induction and DI phases; 
and in the CSF during Induction. Analysis of clinical outcome included response rates during 
Induction at Day 7 and Day 14, and end of Induction marrow examinations. 
For the determination of asparaginase activity, anti-asparaginase antibodies and amino acids, 
blood was collected during induction Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and cerebrospinal fluid was collected 
during induction Days 0, 7 and 28. At least four blood samples were collected from each of 57 
patients in the Oncaspar group and from 45 patients in the native E coli asparaginase group. 
Routine physical examination and laboratory assessments were carried out at periodic intervals 
during the course of the trial. Bone marrow aspirates and lumbar punctures were conducted on 
Days 7 and 28 of Induction. Patients with blasts ≥5% on Day 7 had another bone marrow aspirate 
on Day 14. Bone marrow aspirates were also done at the end of Delayed Intensification #2 and at 
the end of Maintenance therapy.  
Bone marrow responses were defined as: 
-  M1: <5% lymphoblasts regardless of the proportion of mature lymphocytes. 
-  M2: 5-25% lymphoblasts. 
-  M3: >25% lymphoblasts. 
Remission also required normal marrow elements and cellularity. 
Analysis of disease outcome (EFS) was also examined (exploratory). However, it was recognized 
that only large differences in this index would be detectable. Event-free survival (EFS) events 
included induction death, no induction response, relapse at any site, and second malignant 
neoplasm. 
Sample size 
Based on the literature, it was assumed that 50% of patients treated with native ASNase would 
develop ASNase antibodies during the first DI phase. The study was designed to detect a change 
from 50% to 25% or less in incidence of antibodies, with a power of 80% for a 1-sided hypothesis 
test. This led to a sample requirement of approximately 106 patients, assuming that 10% of 
patients might not have samples available for testing (because of early relapse or noncompliance). 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 66/122 
 
 
  
Randomisation 
CCG-1962 had a randomised assignment of patients to receive either PEG-ASNase or native 
ASNase combined with the rest of the therapy program. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
For comparisons of actual values for ASNase antibodies and antibody ratio, the Wilcoxon 
nonparametric rank test was used. 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted on the Oncaspar samples using a 
one-compartment open model to fit the serum asparaginase enzymatic activity and asparagine 
concentrations. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for life-table estimation, and the log-rank test was used to 
compare EFS outcomes. Comparisons of induction response rates and some categorical analyses of 
antibody ratio levels and ASNase activity groupings used exact Chi2 tests that involved global tests 
of differences and tests for trend (ordering) when appropriate. 
Life-table comparisons of EFS outcomes for treatment regimens used intent-to-treat analyses that 
included all randomly assigned patients. 
No specific subsets of the data were defined in the protocol for analysis. Event-free survival (EFS) 
was computed based on the complete data set and a subset with three patients excluded (the 
three patients were taken of study because of Philadelphia and ALL, parental refusal to have a 
second DI phase, and pancreatitis preventing ASNase treatment) and the other measures of 
efficacy were determined based on the availability of the required samples and analytical 
determinations. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 118 patients were randomized, with 59 patients assigned to each treatment arm. Twelve 
patients (10%) were prematurely discontinued from the study before the Maintenance phase: 5 
patients (8%) who received PEG-ASNase and 7 patients (12%) who received native E. coli ASNase. 
The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation was M2 or M3 BM status: 3 patients in the 
native E. coli ASNase group and 1 patient in the PEG-ASNase group. (The location of BM status M2 
or M3 is listed in the database as “other reason” for discontinuation for 4 patients.) One patient in 
the native E. coli ASNase group discontinued treatment due to grade 4 acute pancreatitis, which 
resulted in hospitalization and required intervention to prevent permanent impairment. The patient 
did not have a history of organ dysfunction.  
Recruitment 
The study period was May 1997 to December 2001. Nine investigators at eight investigative sites in 
the U.S. enrolled patients into the study. 
Conduct of the study 
The clinical protocol was amended on 30 December 1997 to include a pharmaco-economic analysis 
of the two ASNase treatments. On 20 July 1998 minor modifications to clarify BM sample 
collection, the toxicity definition for hyperbilirubinemia and steroid dosing were made.

Baseline data 
Patient characteristics according to treatment group are summarised the table below. Patients were 
generally well matched and none of the characteristics was significantly different between the two 
groups. No patients had B-cell (L3) leukaemia. Three children had Down Syndrome and two of 
these were treated with Oncaspar. 
Two patients were excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis. One was Philadelphia chromosome 
positive (Ph+). Following Induction therapy, this patient was withdrawn from the study and given 
more intensive therapy. A second patient mistakenly received both native E coli asparaginase and 
Oncaspar during Induction. In accordance with the protocol, 5 children (4 randomized to native E 
coli asparaginase and 1 treated with Oncaspar) were removed from the study at the end of 
Induction because they had failed to achieve protocol-required bone marrow status. These children 
were treated with more intensive therapy than that used in the study. A total of 10 children (2 in 
the native E coli asparaginase group and 8 in the Oncaspar group) did not receive all the protocol-
specified doses of asparaginase in Delayed Intensification #1 or Delayed Intensification #2 due to 
toxicity, protocol violation or parental choice.

Numbers analysed 
The study enrolled 118 patients. All efficacy analyses (including demographics and baseline 
characteristics) were based on the intent-to-treat population (as randomised). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
At induction, the mean ± SEM anti-asparaginase antibody ratio for Oncaspar and native E.coli L-
asparaginase were 1.3 ± 0.2 (n=41) and 2.3+ 0.9 (n=47) (not statistically significant), while the 
mean ± SEM anti-asparaginase antibody ratio in DI 1 were 1.9 ± 0.8 (n=47) for children treated 
with Oncaspar and 3.0 ± 0.7 (n=43) for those treated with native E.coli L-asparaginase (P=0.001 
by Wilcoxon 2-sample test). 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 69/122 
 
 
  
 
Secondary endpoints 
A secondary endpoint was to show whether the same difference occurred in DI 2. The respective 
mean ± SEM anti-asparaginase antibody ratio for Oncaspar and native E.coli L-asparaginase in DI 
2 were 2.1+0.8 (n=45) and 2.1+0.6 (n=45) (not statistically significant).  
The difference in high-titer antibodies was especially evident in DI 1, in which 11/43 patients in the 
native E.coli ASNase arm had maximum ratios ≥ 2.5 compared with 1/47 in the PEG-ASNase arm 
(P=0.001, Wilcoxon test). The differences were less apparent in DI 2 (P=0.09, Wilcoxon test), and 
not significant during Induction (see Figure below).  
The percentage of patients with an anti-asparaginase antibody ratio > 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 were higher 
in the native enzyme arm both in Induction and DI 1. In DI 2 the advantage of Oncaspar over 
native L-asparaginase was less clear (see figure below).  
Figure 7: Percentage of patients with anti-ASNase antibody ratio over negative control > 1.5, 2.0, 
and 2.5 in CCG-1962 
Asparaginase activity was dependent on anti-asparaginase antibody titer. Table below shows the 
fraction of samples collected 3 to 14 days after the start of asparaginase with asparaginase activity 
> 0.1 IU/mL, a level usually considered adequate to deplete blood asparagine.

Asparagine concentrations 
In all phases of treatment, serum asparagine concentrations decreased within 4 days of the first 
dose of asparaginase in the treatment phase and remained low for approximately 3 weeks for both 
Oncaspar and native E. coli L-asparaginase arms. Serum asparagine concentrations during the 
induction phase are shown in Figure 8. The patterns of serum asparagine depletion in the 2 
delayed intensification phases are similar to the pattern of serum asparagine depletion in the 
induction phase. 
Figure 8: Mean (± standard error) serum asparagine during Study 1 induction phase 
Note:  Oncaspar (2500 Units/m2 intramuscular) was administered on Day 3 of the 4-week 
induction phase.  Native E. coli L-asparaginase (6000 Units/m2 intramuscular) was 
administered 3 times weekly for 9 doses during induction. 
CSF asparagine concentrations were determined in 50 patients during the induction phase. CSF 
asparagine decreased from a mean pre-treatment concentration of 3.1 µM to 1.7 µM on Day 4 ± 1 
and 1.5 µM at 25 ± 1 days after administration of Oncaspar.  These findings were similar to those 
observed in the native E. coli L-asparaginase treatment arm. 
Bone marrow status 
The table below presents the bone marrow status of the patients during Induction on Days 7 and 
14 (or Day 28, if the Day 7 marrow status was M1).

Table 43: Bone marrow status on days 7 and 14, study CCG-1962 
There was statistically significantly faster clearance of lymphoblasts with Oncaspar than with native 
E. coli asparaginase. Sixteen patients (29%) in the native E. coli asparaginase group had M3 
marrows on Day 7 compared to 8 (14%) in the Oncaspar group. All 4 patients with an M3 marrow 
on Day 14, which precipitated removal from the study, were in the native E. coli asparaginase 
group. At the time of the report, 7 patients had relapsed in the Oncaspar group (2x bone marrow, 
3x CNS, 1x combined bone marrow and CNS plus 1 death after bone marrow relapse). This 
compared with 8 relapses in the native E. coli asparaginase group (4x bone marrow and 4 x CNS).

Study DFCI-87-001 (ASP-301): A multicentre, randomized comparison of E. coli ASNase, 
Erwinia ASNase or PEG-ASNase in newly diagnosed ALL patients regardless of relapse risk status. 
This was an open-label study of children with newly-diagnosed ALL. The pharmacokinetics of 
different asparaginase preparations was studied in a subset of the DFCI-87-001 patients (see 
pharmacokinetic section). The data from this sub-study are recorded as Study ASP-301 and were 
published as Asselin et al (1993). 
The objectives of Study DFCI-87-001 were to investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of a single 
intramuscular dose of asparaginase and to correlate it with long-term outcome. 
The following table summarises the efficacy results from study DFCI-87-001 supporting the present 
application. This summary should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as

Two additional studies were presented in support of the first line indication: 
Study DFCI-05-001:  
ALL Consortium Protocol 05-001 was a treatment protocol for newly diagnosed children with ALL. 
Eligible patients must be at least 1 year old, but younger than 18. This protocol implemented the 
intensification of treatment based on end of induction MRD, and therefore built on the findings from 
DFCI 95-001. 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the relative toxicity, clinical efficacy and 
biologic efficacy of IV PEG asparaginase and IM E. coli asparaginase and was subject to monitoring 
by the DMC. Patients were randomized between IV PEG asparaginase and IM E. coli asparaginase 
to assess: 
a. Efficacy (disease-free survival, overall survival) 
b. Health related quality of life, focused on anxiety and pain

c. Trough serum asparaginase enzyme levels, asparagines levels and antiasparaginase antibody 
levels. 
Between 2005 and 2010, 551 evaluable patients were eligible for study treatment, of whom 526 
(95%) achieved CR. In total, 463 patients participated in the ASP randomization following the 
Induction phase and achievement of CR; 232 were randomized to PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) and 231 
were randomized to native E. coli ASP. 
In the Induction Phase (4 weeks), on Day 7, all patients received 1 dose of PEG-ASP (2500 IU/m2) 
by IV infusion in the multi-agent cytotoxic regimen. Following CR, risk stratification, and 
randomization, all patients began 30 consecutive weeks of assigned ASP treatment within the 
multi-agent cytotoxic regimen beginning at Week 7 of treatment: 
• Consolidation Phases (ten 3-week cycles for 30 weeks, VHR patients, for 27 weeks, SR/HR 
patients): 
- IV infusion PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) 2500 IU/m2 every 2 weeks or 
- IM native E. coli ASP 25000 IU/m2 weekly 
• CNS therapy (3 weeks) also included 
- IV infusion PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) 2500 IU/m2 or 
- IM native E. coli ASP 25000 IU/m2 weekly doses 
• Asparaginase continued through CNS phase and Consolidation phases until a total of 30 doses of 
native E. coli ASP (dosed 3 times every week) or 15 doses of PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) (dosed once 
every two weeks) were administered. 
The median follow-up overall for patients remaining alive is 6.0 years (range, 0.5 to 9.2). Event-
free survival (EFS or disease free survival, DFS, as appropriate for some characteristics) rates were 
calculated from date of registration, except for EFS by randomized arm, risk group, and end-
induction minimal residual disease (MRD), which were calculated from time of randomization. 
The 5-year EFS [95% CI] for all 551 patients was 85% [82-88%] and the 5-year OS was 91% [88-
93%] both calculated from the date of registration. No significant differences were observed 
between randomization arms for DFS (p=0.58) or OS (p=0.30). 
The DFS [95% CI] and OS [95% CI] for PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) vs native E. coli ASP regardless of 
risk group category was: 
• 5-year DFS rate: PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) 90% [86-94%] versus native E. coli ASP 89% [85-93%] 
• 5-year OS rate: PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) 96% [93-98%] versus native E. coli ASP 94% [89-96%] 
Serum Asparaginase Activity Levels 
Per protocol, asparaginase enzyme levels for native E. coli ASP and PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) were 
drawn at different time points as described in the study report . The majority of patients (87%) in 
induction had a therapeutic level (≥ 0.10 IU/mL) by day 25 in induction (or 18 days following the 
induction dose of PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) at 2500 IU/m2). The number of patients achieving a 
therapeutic level post-induction was significantly higher for patients who received PEG-ASP 
(Oncaspar) (99%) compared to those who received native E. coli ASP (71%) (p<0.001). 
Exploratory analysis: health related quality of life (HR-QoL) 
A health related quality of life (HR-QoL) analysis was conducted in 202 children and adolescents 
(2-18 years old) with newly diagnosed ALL randomized to receive either IM native E. coli ASP (97 
Assessment report

patients) weekly or IV PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) (105 patients) every other week over 30 weeks during 
DFCI-ALL protocol intensification therapy.  
Parents and patients (when age appropriate) filled out the surveys at 3 times points: after 
induction but before the first dose of asparaginase in CNS (baseline), between the 10th and 15th 
week of Consolidation II therapy, and one year after the initial diagnosis of ALL and enrollment 
onto 05-001. The patient and parent were analyzed separately. The survey was a 24-item HR-QoL 
questionnaire to measure anxiety domains, including treatment anxiety, procedural anxiety, 
emotional functioning, pain/hurt, general fatigue and sleep/rest fatigue. 
In parents-proxy reports for younger patients, treatment anxiety scores during asparaginase 
therapy were higher, indicating a better HRQoL treatment anxiety score, for parents whose children 
were randomized to receive PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) compared to native E. coli ASP (p=0.0242). 
Procedural anxiety scores were also higher for parents whose children were randomized to receive 
PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) compared to native E. coli ASP at baseline time point of assessment 
(p=0.0285) and persisted during therapy (p=0.0026).

for randomized patients 
Procedural anxiety scores for patients were also higher, indicating a better HRQoL procedural 
anxiety score, for those randomized to receive PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) (p=0.0288) during 
asparaginase therapy.

Study AALL07P4: A Pilot Study of intravenous EZN-2285 (SC-PEG E. coli L-asparaginase, IND# 
100594) or Intravenous Oncaspar in the Treatment of Patients with High-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic 
Leukaemia.  
This study was a COG study designed for newly diagnosed patients from 1 to 30 years of age with 
NCI HR B-precursor ALL (HRALL).  
White blood cell (WBC) criteria were a) Age 1-10 years: WBC ≥  50,000/μL; b) Age 10.000-30.999 
years: Any WBC; c) Prior steroid therapy: Any WBC. Patients were not allowed prior cytotoxic 
chemotherapy with the exception of steroids and intrathecal cytarabine. This was a controlled, 
randomized study comparing another PEG-ASP product, EZN-2285, versus PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) in 
the first line treatment of ALL.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the pharmacokinetic comparability of EZN-
2285 compared to PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) given IV during Induction and Consolidation in patients 
with high-risk ALL receiving augmented BFM therapy. 
Some of the secondary objectives were: 
•  To assess event-free survival (EFS) associated with the administration of EZN-2285 given 
during augmented post Induction intensification therapy to patients with high-risk ALL compared to 
Oncaspar 
•  To assess the tolerability and toxicities associated with the administration of EZN-2285 given 
during augmented post Induction intensification therapy to patients with HR ALL compared to 
Oncaspar  
•  To assess the immunogenicity of EZN-2285 including the detection of binding and neutralizing 
antibodies compared to Oncaspar  
•  To determine the proportion of patients with an asparaginase level of at least 0.1 IU/mL and the 
proportion with at least 0.4 IU/mL on Days 4, 15, 22 and 29 of induction compared to Oncaspar. 
A total of 166 patients were enrolled in this study, 54 patients were randomized to treatment with 
2500 U/m2 Oncaspar and 111 patients were randomized to another pegylated asparaginase 
product.

Treatments 
Treatment of these patients included combined, effective, cytotoxic multi-agent chemotherapeutic 
regimens for each treatment phase in the context of current practice and institutional guidelines 
combined with PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) to treat HR ALL. Treatment and randomization to PEG-ASP was 
as follows with patients continuing to receive the randomly assigned PEG-ASP product on the same 
schedule used in the PC arm (prednisone during Induction therapy and escalating methotrexate 
without leucovorin rescue during the first Interim Maintenance) of the current COG trial for high-
risk ALL, AALL0232: 
• Patients were randomized in a 2:1 manner to receive 2500 IU/m2/day EZN-2285 or 2500 
IU/m2/day PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) given by IV infusion on Day 4 of Induction. These doses were used 
throughout treatment. 
• For some patients, Extended Induction for an additional 2 weeks was based on the Day 29 bone 
marrow evaluation for patients having M2 marrow or an M1 marrow with ≥  1% MRD. Patients 
received the randomized PEG-ASP treatment on Day 4 of the Extended Induction 
• Consolidation therapy included EZN-2285 or PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) given by IV infusion on Days 15 
and 43 
• Following Consolidation therapy, Interim Maintenance I and II included EZN-2285 or PEG-ASP 
(Oncaspar) given by IV infusion on Days 2 and 22 of each cycle 
• Delayed Intensification I and II followed Interim Maintenance I and II, respectively, and included 
EZN-2285 or PEG-ASP (Oncaspar) given by IV infusion on Days 4 and 43 
Maintenance followed the final Delayed Intensification Phase and consisted of repeated 12 week 
cycles. The total duration of therapy was 2 years from the start of Interim Maintenance I for female 
patients, and 3 years from the start of Interim Maintenance I for male patients. 
The EFS and overall survival (OS) was determined by randomized treatment group.  
At 3-years, the EFS and overall survival (OS) for the Oncaspar treatment arm were 85.1% [95% CI 
72-92%] and 92.4% [95% CI 81-97%], respectively. Overall, in the group receiving Oncaspar, all 
grade of hypersensitivity was 9.8%, anaphylactic reactions was 19.6%, and pancreatitis 5.9%. 
Grade 3 or higher of febrile neutropenia was 37.9% (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Second-line population 
Study ASP-001  
The objectives of this trial were to define toxicities, determine the maximum tolerated dose, 
evaluate the clinical pharmacology and efficacy of Oncaspar administered as a 1-hour infusion 
every 2 weeks. Ascending multiple doses in the range 500-8,000 IU/m2 were administered i.v. 
The patient population included 37 pre-treated patients (17 males, 20 females) aged 15-73 years 
with refractory haematological malignancies. The study is described and discussed under the 
pharmacokinetics section. 
Only 1 hypersensitive ALL patient was enrolled in study ASP-001. No specific efficacy data could be 
inferred for the single hypersensitive patient enrolled in study ASP-001.

Study ASP-001C/003C 
Study ASP-001C/003C was an open label trial of PEG-L-asparaginase in the treatment of patients 
in relapse with malignant hematologic disorders. Patients in relapse with ALL, acute 
undifferentiated leukaemia or other hematologic disorders who, in the opinion of the sponsor and 
the investigator, might benefit from treatment with Oncaspar, were eligible for the study. 
Patients were eligible for inclusion into the study if they had one of the following: At least one 
relapse; Documented hypersensitivity to other forms of L-asparaginase. 
Patients were excluded if they had: Severe respiratory distress; A requirement for an endotracheal 
tube; An intracranial haemorrhage; An active symptomatic disease of the central nervous system; 
Rapidly progressing fatal illnesses other than haematological malignancies. 
History of prior hypersensitivity to either E.Coli and/or Erwinia L-asparaginase included local and 
systemic reactions ranging from grade 1 to grade 4 according to common toxicity criteria. 
PEG-ASNase was administered at a dose of 2,000 IU/m2 IM as a single agent or in combination 
therapy to induce remission during induction. A subsequent amendment allowed patients in CR to 
receive maintenance therapy, given as 2,000 IU/m2 IM either as a single agent or in combination 
with other chemotherapy agents, with a dosing interval of not less than one week (as determined 
by the investigator) until treatment with Oncaspar was no longer considered safe or beneficial to 
the patient. 
The study objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of Oncaspar as a single agent or in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents in inducing and maintaining remission in patients 
with refractory hematologic malignancies or in ALL patients who had known hypersensitivity to the 
native forms of L-asparaginase. 
A total of 41 relapsed patients with a variety of haematological malignancies were enrolled, ranging 
from 1 to 66 years old. Thirty-four of these patients had a diagnosis of ALL, five had other 
leukaemias, one had testicular lymphoma and one had a cutaneous T-Cell NHL (mycosis fungoides 
type). Thirty of the 41 total patients (73%) were hypersensitive to native L-asparaginase. Twenty-
nine of these patients had ALL and one had testicular lymphoma. 
Efficacy data for 38 patients were evaluated. Three hypersensitive patients were not evaluated for 
efficacy. Response rates in hypersensitive patients at the end of induction are summarized in table 
below: 
Table 49: Clinical response: hypersensitive patients in induction phase, study ASP-001C/003C 
One hypersensitive patient out of 4 (25%) obtained a CR when PEG-ASNase was administered as 
single agent, while the remaining 3 hypersensitive patients had no response. When Oncaspar was

administered in combined therapy, CR was reached by 2 hypersensitive patients (29%), with 1 
additional hypersensitive patient obtaining PR (14%).

The majority (17/19, 89%) of evaluable hypersensitive patients remain in CR during maintenance 
therapy with Oncaspar. A relapse occurred in 2 subjects. 
Study ASP-201A: An open label multicentre study of PEG-L-asparaginase in the treatment of 
acute lymphocytic leukaemia or acute undifferentiated leukaemia in children. 
ALL or AUL patients relapsed after exposure to native ASNase were enrolled. Nine patients with 
known hypersensitivity to native forms of L-asparaginase were also included. 
Inclusion criteria were:  Histological proof of ALL or AUL; At least one relapse; Patient entered at 
diagnosis of relapse; Measurable disease present; Patient classified as standard or high risk; Score 
of ≤ 2 on the Zubrod Scale;Patient had relapsed after exposure to native L-asparaginase. 
Exclusion criteria were: Severe respiratory distress; Requirement for an endotracheal tube; 
Intracranial haemorrhage; Septic shock; Anaphylactic reaction to prior treatment with native L-
asparaginase; Pancreatitis or history of pancreatitis; Rapidly progressing fatal illness other than 
haematological malignancies; History of coagulopathy; Other neoplasms (except skin non-

melanoma); Hyperuricaemia; Liver abnormalities (SGOT >200 IU/mL, SGPT >200 IU/mL); 
Impaired renal function (serum creatinine >2 mg% or >50 mM). 
Exceptions were permitted to allow patients with known hypersensitivity to native forms of L-
asparaginase to be enrolled. In addition, the protocol was amended to allow the investigator to 
continue treatment beyond the induction phase for any patient that was considered to have 
responded to the PEG-L-asparaginase treatment. 
PEG-ASNase 2,000 IU/m2 was administered once every two weeks (3 doses) during a five week 
induction period. Over a 14 day "investigational window" PEG-ASNase was administered as a single 
agent and, subsequently, in combination with Vincristine and Prednisone (standard induction 
agents for ALL), by intramuscular injection or 2-hour intravenous infusion at the investigator's 
discretion. Study protocol was amended to allow the investigator to continue treatment beyond the 
induction phase for any patient that was considered to have obtained a good response.  
The objective of this open-label trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of Oncaspar in 
inducing remission in relapsed children with ALL or acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) during a 
five week induction period. 
A total of 42 relapsed patients were enrolled in this study. Diagnoses were ALL (n=37), T-cell NHL 
(n=2), acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL; n=2) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML; 
n=1). Nine of the 42 patients had known hypersensitivity to the native forms of L-ASNase prior to 
study enrolment, including 7 cases of ALL.  
A total of 44 doses of PEG-ASNase were administered to the 9 hypersensitive patients (range 2-10 
doses per patient). Response rates reported for the 9 hypersensitive patients are summarised 
below. 
Table 34: Highest therapeutic response in hypersensitive patients, study ASP-201A 
Hypersensitive patients had an overall PEG-ASNase response rate of 50% (single agent) and 63% 
(as part of standard combination induction therapy).  
The  highest  therapeutic  responses  achieved  by  the  non-hypersensitive  patients  are  shown  in  the 
table below:

Table 35: Highest therapeutic response in non-hypersensitive patients, Study ASP-201A 
Overall, the non-hypersensitive patients had an Oncaspar response rate of 57% as a single agent 
and 84% as part of standard combination induction therapy. 
Study ASP-302: Intensified therapy based on patient specific system exposure to VM-26 in 
children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
The study had an open-label design and was conducted in 3 phases:  
Phase I: Early therapy. 
Phase II: Re-induction therapy. 
Phase III: Remission therapy / maintenance. 
The study was conducted in relapsed ALL patients. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had 
evidence of bone marrow relapse during or after treatment with multi-agent rotational 
chemotherapy.  Patients were excluded if they had a history of life-threatening sensitivity to VM-26 
(teniposide). A known hypersensitivity to other (non-PEGylated) forms of L-asparaginase did not 
exclude a patient from participation. 
PEG-ASNase 2,500 IU/m2 was administered IM every 2 weeks during re-induction and remission 
therapy, for a total of 29 administrations as part of a multi-drug chemotherapy protocol. Twenty-
one relapsed ALL patients were enrolled, including 4 patients hypersensitive to native ASNase.  
The main purpose of this study was to obtain pharmacokinetic and long-term safety data on 
Oncaspar. 
The study was conducted in 21 relapsed ALL patients (13 male, 8 female) ranging in age from 1 to 
35 years old. Four of the male patients were known to be hypersensitive to native asparaginase 
prior to study participation.  
The 4 hypersensitive patients received a collective total of 72 doses of Oncaspar ranging from 10 to 
29 doses per patient. The 17 non-hypersensitive patients received a collective total of 107 doses of 
Oncaspar ranging from 2 to 15 doses per patient. 
Although efficacy evaluation was not a formal objective of this study, some assessments of efficacy 
were anyway performed and a summary of response is shown below:

Study ASP-304: PEG-L-asparaginase vs native-L-asparaginase in combination with standard 
agents as second induction therapy in children with ALL in bone marrow relapse. 
Inclusion criteria: Diagnosis of ALL before age 21 years and was in the second hematological 
relapse; Life expectancy ≥ 4 weeks Adequate hepatic and renal function (SGPT <200 IU/L; 
creatinine <2 mg/dL). 
Exclusion criteria were as follows: Presence of CNS disease (unless the investigator judged it 
appropriate to withhold intrathecal chemotherapy during the 4 weeks of Oncaspar combination 
chemotherapy; intrathecal medication could be given with the screening lumbar puncture at the 
discretion of the physician); Failure of other induction regimens which contained L-asparaginase. 
Patients without a history of hypersensitivity to native (E coli or Erwinia) asparaginase were 
randomised to receive either PEG-ASNase 2,500 IU/m2 IM (2 total doses: Day 1 and Day 15) or 
native E coli-derived ASNase 10,000 IU/m2 IM (12 total doses: 3 times per week for 26 days). In 
case of known hypersensitivity to native enzyme, patients were directly assigned to treatment with 
PEG-ASNase.  
In the PEG-ASNase arm, treatment continuation in the maintenance phase was at the physician’s 
discretion. Patients assigned to native E.coli ASNase were also allowed to continue maintenance 
therapy with PEG-ASNase following a protocol amendment. 
The objectives of the study were to compare the efficacy and toxicity of Oncaspar administration 
with that of native E coli-derived L-asparaginase when used as part of a standard combination 
chemotherapy re-induction regimen in children with ALL who are in second haematologic relapse. 
The pharmacokinetic objectives were to determine the drug half-life for each product. In addition, 
antibodies to L-asparaginase were monitored in all patients. 
Plasma concentrations of L-asparaginase and anti-asparaginase antibody titres were ascertained 
prior to the administration of Oncaspar and on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36. Patients were 
evaluated on Day 29 for evidence of clinical response and were followed to Day 36 for toxicities 
and adverse experiences. 
Objective responses to Oncaspar were recorded on Day 35 by the investigators against the 
following criteria: 
•  Complete remission: M1 marrow (<5% blasts). 
•  Partial remission: M2 marrow (≥ 5 to ≤ 25% blasts). 
•  Minor response: A 75% decrease in circulating blasts or organomegaly, without a change in 
marrow status. 
•  Stable disease: No change in clinical or marrow status. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 86/122 
 
 
  
 
 
•  No response: M3 marrow (>25% blasts), without improvement in peripheral blood counts or 
organomegaly. 
•  Progressive disease: >25% increase of blasts in the marrow or peripheral blood, or rapid and 
advancing organomegaly. 
In addition, at each clinic visit the investigator evaluated the patient's response to treatment based 
upon clinical symptomatology, measurements of the liver, spleen and lymph nodes plus profiles of 
peripheral blood or bone marrow. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were repeated at the time of 
a patient's termination from the study where possible. 
A total of 76 patients participated in the study (47 male, 29 female). Of these, 16 completed the 
trial. The remaining were terminated from the study for the following reasons: Progressive disease 
(n=27); Relapse (n=18); Bone marrow transplant (n=7); Death (n=4); Toxicities (n=3); Refusal 
of further therapy (n=1). Forty patients were directly assigned to Oncaspar treatment and 19 
further patients were randomized to Oncaspar therapy. These patients received 2 doses of the drug 
intramuscularly at 2,500 IU/m2 every 14 days. Seventeen patients were randomized to treatment 
with 10,000 IU/m2 intramuscular native E. coli L-asparaginase (Elspar) 3 times per week for a total 
of 12 doses. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics are presented in the table below:

The ORR for the two randomized populations was similar (56% vs 47%) and the difference was not 
statistically significant (chi squared test, p=0.615). The rate of CR in the randomised populations 
was 39% vs 47% (p=0.625).  
The clinical response data were summarised by Day 0 and Day 28 anti-L-asparaginase antibody 
levels to determine if there was a correlation and data are presented below:

Study ASP-400: A pilot study for the evaluation of PEG-L-asparaginase in the treatment of 
patients in relapse with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. 
This is an open-label multicentre study. The study was conducted in Germany. 
Patients were eligible as follows: Age ≤21 years; Histological proof of ALL, AUL or NHL; ≥1 relapse. 
Exclusion criteria were: Age >21 years; Severe respiratory distress; Requirement for an 
endotracheal tube; Intracranial haemorrhage; Septic shock. 
The study was divided into 3 phases: 
Phase I: Induction treatment lasting 15 days in which PEG-ASNase 2,000 IU/m2 IV was 
administered on Day 12. The other drugs used during this phase were cisplatin, vincristine, 
methotrexate and prednisone.

Phase II: Consolidation treatment C1, starting at Week 3 and lasting 7 days, in which PEG-ASNase 
2,000 IU/m2 IV was administered on Day 5. The other drugs used during this phase were 
methotrexate, HD Ara-C and VP-16. 
Phase III: Consolidation treatment C2, starting at Week 6 and lasting 7 days, in which PEG-ASNase 
2,000 IU/m2 IV was administered on Day 5. The other drugs used during this phase were HD 
prednisone, DDP or ifosfamide, daunorubicin and methotrexate. 
Phase II therapy was repeated on Week 9 of treatment after a bone marrow aspirate was obtained. 
At Week 12, if the patient achieved (or had been maintained in) CR, the possibility to perform an 
autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant was evaluated. All patients were to be terminated 
from the study at Week 12. The analysis comprises 44 patients, 13/44 (30%) were known to be 
hypersensitive to native L-ASNase. All 13 hypersensitive patients had a diagnosis of ALL. 
The primary objective of this open-label multicenter study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of Oncaspar in patients who relapsed within 15 months of diagnosis or had shown evidence of 
refractory disease. A secondary purpose was to induce a complete remission so that patients could 
qualify for autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 
A total of 51 patients were enrolled and, of these, records were available for analysis from 47 
patients. Two patients were excluded from the analysis for protocol violations. In addition, one 
patient was enrolled twice with different investigator/patient numbers and was considered as a 
single patient in the data analysis. Therefore the analysis comprises 44 patients (26 males, 18 
females). Thirteen of these patients (6 males, 7 females; 30% of total) were known to be 
hypersensitive to native L-asparaginase. All hypersensitive patients had a diagnosis of ALL. 
31 of the 44 patients were not hypersensitive to native L-asparaginase and ranged in age from 2 to 
18 years old. Among them, 29 had a diagnosis of ALL and 2 had a diagnosis of NHL. 
The highest objective response achieved by each patient was considered the highest therapeutic 
response.

Clinical studies in special populations 
The age distribution of hypersensitive ALL patients included in the PEG-ASNase clinical trials in the 
second-line population (excluding Study ASP-400) is shown below: 
Figure 10: Age distribution of hypersensitive ALL patients studied (all Oncaspar trials; n=82) 
Almost all the studied hypersensitive patients were paediatric with none being more than 20 years 
old. Therapeutic responses by age for hypersensitive ALL patients participating in Studies ASP-001, 
ASP-001C/003C, ASP-302 and ASP-304 are shown below. These data are related to 77 patients, 
including 51 with a clinical response (66%) and 25 patients who had no clinical response (34%). 
Figure 11: Hypersensitive ALL patients by age and clinical response (n=76) 
The diagram shows that the pattern of response/no response is evenly distributed at least up to 
the early teenage years. Although the number of hypersensitive ALL patients aged ≥14 years is 
small (n=15), only 1 of these patients (7%) did not respond to treatment with PEG-ASNase. 
Twenty-five out of 43 hypersensitive ALL patients aged 1 to <10 years (58%) had a clinical 
response, while twenty-six out of 33 higher risk patients aged <1 year or ≥10 years (79%) had a 
clinical response.

With respect to non-hypersensitive patients, the four studies investigating Oncaspar use in the 
first-line population all reported sub-group data in slightly different ways and/or studied differing 
patient populations. Accordingly, direct comparison of the results in sub-populations is not possible. 
Table below summarises the main efficacy sub-group data from these studies. 
Table 61: Subgroup analyses in clinical trials investigating first-line use of Oncaspar 
Supportive studies 
As supportive data a review of published literature relevant to the indication in the first-line and 
second line population was conducted. The searching and selection strategy resulted in the 
inclusion of 23 relevant publications that were covered by the analysis for the first line indication. 
Eighteen out of 23 publications related to children, while 6 out of 23 were relevant to adults (but 4 
of the “paediatric” papers include patients up to age 21 years). Fourteen papers globally concerned 
newly-diagnosed patients, 1 paper concerned a pre-induction treatment window, 5 studied initial 
induction and 8 looked at consolidation/intensification. Eleven papers studied relapsed/refractory 
patients. 
Four papers (Barry et al. 2007; Jarrar et al. 2006; Salzer et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2006) discussed 
the efficacy results from studies investigating the use of 2.500 IU/m2 Oncaspar every 2 weeks. 
Efficacy results showed better responses in young, newly-diagnosed patients with ALL (Barry et al, 
2007). Jarrer et al (2006), Salzer et al (2007) and Winter et al (2006) all studied higher risk

groups so the lower reported efficacy rates are to be expected. It is not possible to establish the 
effect of the switch from 2-weekly to 4-weekly dosing on efficacy outcomes in Winter et al (2006).  
Six publications discuss the efficacy results from studies investigating the use of Oncaspar in 
children at doses and schedules other than 2.500 IU/m2 every 2 weeks. Three of these (Appel et 
al. 2008; Sedki et al. 2008; Vora et al. 2013) concerned less intensive therapy and three look at 
more intensive therapy. Efficacy with reduced intensity Oncaspar treatments was good in the 
easier-to-treat populations (i.e. new diagnosis pre-B ALL patients and patients with low-risk 
disease following initial Induction therapy). Efficacy was also good in terms of re-induction in 
relapsed/refractory ALL (Sedki et al, 2008) although this was a very small study. Of note, the 
patients in this study who achieved remission underwent BMT, which made assessment of 
Oncaspar role in long-term outcome challenging. 
Efficacy in harder-to-treat populations (i.e. pre-T ALL and BCR-ABL positive disease) was more 
modest. The relationship between good early clinical response (in terms of MRD) and favourable 
long-term outcome is confirmed. All the reported efficacy results are consistent with expectations. 
With regards to the efficacy data relative to children treated with more intensive Oncaspar regimes, 
three studies (Raetz et al. 2008; Saarinen-Pihkala et al. 2012; Thomson et al. 2004) where more 
intensive Oncaspar therapy was administered were conducted in children with relapsed ALL. There 
was no evidence that a more intensive therapy might be beneficial in newly-diagnosed disease. All 
studies used Oncaspar for either 2 or 4 consecutive weeks in the context of re-Induction. There is 
therefore no suggestion that more intensive therapy might be beneficial over longer periods during 
consolidation and/or intensification. The success rate for achieving remission is consistently high 
(≥ 89%) except for patients with early relapse (a known poor prognostic factor). For these 
patients, remission achievement was 68% (Raetz et al, 2008). EFS for patients with isolated extra-
medullary relapse was good (75% after 4 years), but 4-year EFS in general was much lower 
(49%). This is consistent with the relapsed setting. Literature data show that Oncaspar had been 
effectively used in every paediatric ALL setting and with variable doses and schedules of 
administration. Results are dependent on the population which has been investigated. 
Two publications (Aguayo et al. 1999; Ayoubi et al. 2009) discussed the efficacy results from 
studies investigating the use of Oncaspar at the dose of 2.500 IU/m2 every two weeks in adults. 
The efficacy results were disappointing, as expected given that the trial investigated a 
refractory/relapsed adult populations characterized by a known poor prognosis. In both studies the 
median duration of remission in those patients who achieved it was similar (3-4 months). Overall, 
the results confirmed that the prognosis for adults with relapsed ALL is weak. 
Three publications (Kozlowski et al. 2012; Douer et al. 2007; Vora et al. 2013) discussed the 
efficacy results from studies investigating the use of Oncaspar in adults at doses and schedules 
other than 2.500 IU/m2 every 2 weeks. All of these concern less intensive therapy than is proposed 
for marketing. Kozlowski et al (2012) studied relapsed adult patients (similar to Aguayo et al, 1999 
and Ayoubi et al, 2009; see above) but with a very low Oncaspar dose (500 IU/m2). An 
encouraging 63% of patients achieved remission but only 15% were still alive at 5 years. The data 
from Douer et al (2007) showed that Oncaspar is efficacious in inducing remission in newly-
diagnosed adult patients.  The dose used was slightly lower than is proposed for marketing (2.000 
IU/m2 vs 2.500 IU/m2). Remission was achieved in 96% of cases, which is comparable to the 
remission rate seen in children. Unfortunately, relapse rate and overall survival are much worse 
than is the case for children. The Study by Vora et al (2013) was large, but only a small subset of 
patients (n=20) were aged ≥ 16 years and none was aged >25 years. Furthermore, the patients 
were treated according to paediatric oncology approaches. The inclusion of this trial under “adults” 
here is therefore dictated by the conventional approach to age categorization rather than by the 
philosophy of the study. Detailed efficacy outcomes for the “adult” sub-group are not reported. A 
hazard ratio for older age with relatively narrow confidence intervals was obtained from so few 
Assessment report

Page 92/122 
 
 
  
older patients. All three publications concern less intensive Oncaspar therapy; more intensive use 
has not been investigated despite the relatively poor outcomes for adults with ALL.  
Complete remission rates and OS outcomes across publications are very heterogeneous, confirming 
the scarce information about the use of Oncaspar in adult patients, especially in the first-line 
setting.  
Regarding publications relevant to the indication in the Second-Line Population, a relative small 
number of literature papers about Oncaspar administration have been produced as compared to 
first-line patients. In the publication of Kurtzberg et al. in both the Oncaspar directly assigned and 
the Oncaspar randomized group, when a high titre of anti-asparaginase antibodies was detected, 
CR rates dropped from 75-85% to 40%. The importance of anti-asparaginase antibody status in 
second-line patients treated with Oncaspar is therefore confirmed.Abishire et al. (2000) 
investigated every week vs 2-weekly administration of Oncaspar (2.500 IU/m2) in relapsed ALL 
patients. Weekly Oncaspar in hypersensitive patients conferred a 7-fold decrease in risk of 
induction failure (OR 0.13, 95%CI 0.028-0.599).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The sources of native E. coli L-asparaginase drug substance used in the manufacture of Oncaspar 
has varied through the development of the product and thus differed between the clinical trials 
conducted (the majority of proprietary clinical trials used the enzyme from Supplier M except study 
ASP-304 which used the enzyme from Supplier K) and from the native E coli L-asparaginase 
expected to be used in the commercial product (enzyme from Supplier L). Analytical comparability 
exercises showed that the resulting products were comparable (see quality aspects). In addition, a 
PK comparison of Supplier L and Supplier M enzymes established the relevance of the Supplier M 
data (see data presented under pharmacology aspects). The applicant is recommended to submit 
the final results of the PK/PD analysis to further assess the PK comparability between the Supplier 
L and Supplier M products (REC). 
Oncaspar has been administered in dose-response studies with different doses (range 500 IU/m2 – 
8.000 IU/m2), schedules (every week / every two weeks) and routes of administration (IM or IV). 
Most patients were eventually treated at the dose of 2.000 – 2.500 IU/m2 every other week, 
consistent with the dose proposed in the SmPC. The 2500 U/m² body surface area every 14 days 
for patients with a body surface area ≥0.6 m2 and who are ≤21 years of age can be considered 
well justified, taking into account the comprehensive data submitted. 
For children with BSA <0.6m2, it is acknowledged that the optimum dosage has not been rigorously 
investigated in clinical trials. However, the recommended posology of 82.5 IU/kg body weight for 
children with a body surface area < 0.6 m² every 14 days is justified based on data available 
experience (see SmPC section 4.2). 
In patients under 55 years old, the optimal posology of Oncaspar appears to be 2000 IU/m2 with a 
2 – weekly dosing schedule. Data in elderly patients are scarce (see SmPC section 4.2).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The applicant presented data to support the use of Oncaspar in the treatment of patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) which includes both first line and second line treatment. The 
first line treatment concerns newly diagnosed patients never treated for their disease (patients non 
hypersensitive to native asparaginase) and the second line treatment concerns patients with one 
relapse/treatment failure. In the context of a second line treatment, Oncaspar has been assessed

when it is used in first intention, i.e. when native asparaginase could be used and also when it is 
used in second intention, i.e. when native asparaginase cannot be used due to hypersensitivity. 
Four clinical trials (CCG-1961, CCG-1962, DFCI-87-001, DFCI-91-01) were initially provided in 
support of the indication in first line non-hypersensitive population. The main study supporting the 
use of Oncaspar in first line, non-hypersensitive patients is study CCG-1962. The applicant also 
submitted the CSR of study AALL07P4 as well as the statistical report of study DFCI 05-001 in 
support of this indication. Overall, 720 patients were treated with Oncaspar in first-line across 
these three studies. 
Study CCG-1962 compared a single injection of Oncaspar (2.500 IU/m2) during induction and 
Delayed Intensifications vs. 9 injections of native E-coli L-asparaginase (6.000 IU/m2) during 
induction and 6 during each Delayed Intensification. From an efficacy point of view, this study was 
not specifically powered to detect event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) differences 
between treatment groups. However, the results were considered clinically relevant. The overall 3 -
year EFS was 83% in Oncaspar arm and 79% in native asparaginase arm. The 7-year EFS were 
75% in Oncaspar versus 66% in native asparaginase arm.  
With regards to immunogenicity data collected in study CCG-1962, as tests used to detect 
antibodies were different from an arm to another, no conclusion can be drawn on the comparability 
between the immunogenicity of pegaspargase versus native asparaginase. Nevertheless, 
immunogenicity data were obtained in several studies through the development program indicating 
reduced immunogenicity for pegaspargase. 
With regards to study DFCI-05-001, only patients with an optimal response with an Oncaspar 
containing induction regimen could be randomised to receive either Oncaspar (2.500 UI/m2 every 
two weeks) or weekly doses of native E. coli L-asparaginase (25.000 IU/m2) in all the subsequent 
treatment phases. However, from a PD point of view, data from this study are reassuring: in the 
87% of patients asparaginase activity measured at day 25 of induction (i.e. approximately 18 days 
after a single dose of Oncaspar) was not below the therapeutic level (> 0.10 IU/ml). Moreover, in 
all subsequent treatment phases, asparaginase activity was constantly significantly higher in 
patients treated with Oncaspar compared with native E. coli asparaginase. From an efficacy point of 
view, no significant differences between treatment groups in study DFCI-05-001 with respect to 5-
year EFS and OS rates could be observed. However, it should be pointed out that, since all patients 
were treated with Oncaspar during induction (i.e. the treatment phase in which the bulk of 
cytoreduction is achieved), any possible difference in efficacy between the two asparaginases might 
have been lessened. The 5-year OS rates in both treatment arms in this study were clinically 
relevant (96% with Oncaspar and 94% with native E. coli asparaginase). 
Results from study AALL07P4 supported the efficacy of Oncaspar when used in first-line (3-year 
EFS 85%, 3-year OS 92.4%). 
The Applicant also conducted an additional systematic review of the literature to provide additional 
data to support the non-inferiority of Oncaspar compared to native E. coli asparaginase in first-line 
(data not shown). Overall, 646 publications were identified, and only 40 publications were 
considered for analysis. Due to the lack of direct and indirect comparison data, however, no meta-
analysis exercise could eventually be performed. The Applicant provided separate pooled estimates 
of outcomes and events. Overall, results from all pooled analyses did not show any significant 
reduction in the efficacy outcomes observed when Oncaspar is used upfront. 
Overall, the administration advantages of Oncaspar compared with native E. coli asparaginase 
(including reduced immunogenicity) are acknowledged. The advantages in terms of posology with 
Oncaspar (i.e. less frequent administrations) were supported by an exploratory HR-QoL analysis 
performed in study DFCI-05-001. Reduced procedural anxiety scores in parents-proxy as well as in 
patients were observed with Oncaspar compared with native E. coli L-asparaginase.  
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016

The efficacy of Oncaspar was also assessed in patients with ALL with one relapse/treatment failure 
(second line indication). Most of the relevant data submitted in this application concerning the 
benefit of Oncaspar in second line indication comes from a single comparative study ASP-304. 
Additional supportive studies provided relevant data in patients previously treated and 
hypersensitive to native asparaginase. Five open-label studies (ASP-001, ASP-001C/003C, ASP-
201A, ASP-302, ASP-400) evaluated Oncaspar in relapse/refractory haematological diseases.  
In these six studies a total of 94 patients with ALL diagnosis with a history of prior clinical allergic 
reaction to native E. coli L-asparaginase were exposed to Oncaspar. One patient received Oncaspar 
doses of 250 and 500 Units/m2 intravenously. The remaining patients were treated with 2000 or 
2500 U/m2 administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Patients received Oncaspar as a single 
agent or in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Overall, from five studies analysed (ASP-
001, ASP-304, ASP-201A, ASP-302, ASP-400) based on 65 ALL patients exposed to Oncaspar using 
the highest therapeutic response during the entire study, complete remission were observed in 30 
patients (46%), partial remission in 7 patients (11%) and haematological improvement in 1 patient 
(2%). In study ASP-001C/003C, with 29 hypersensitive ALL patients exposed to Oncaspar, 11 
patients were evaluated for response during induction. Of these, 3 patients achieved complete 
remission (27%), 1 patient had partial remission (9%), 1 patient had haematologic improvement 
(9%) and 2 patients had therapeutic efficacy (18%). Therapeutic efficacy was defined as a clinical 
improvement which did not meet the criteria for other beneficial outcomes. During the 
maintenance phase, 19 patients were evaluated, with 17 patients achieving complete remission 
(89%), and 1 patient with therapeutic efficacy, (5%) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
In this population of patients hypersensitive to native asparaginase, no direct randomised 
comparative study versus native asparaginase is warranted and the provided data are considered 
sufficient. Results of study ASP-304 show that in ALL patients, in second relapse, Oncaspar, as part 
of the induction regimen permits to obtain a complete remission rate of 41%. These results taken 
together with the impossibility to reintroduce the native E. coli asparaginase in hypersensitive 
patients are sufficient to establish the efficacy of Oncaspar in second line in patients hypersensitive 
to native asparaginase.  
Patients who are not hypersensitive to asparaginase still have the option to receive native 
asparaginase in second line treatment. Results from the comparative randomised study ASP-304 
versus native E. coli asparaginase showed a negative trend concerning Oncaspar in terms of 
complete remission rates. However, the observed CR difference lacks statistical significance, 
possibly due to the fact that inclusions were stopped before reaching the planned sample size. 
Moreover, results from the additional single arm studies are of poor reliability and are difficult to 
interpret, especially since they show contradictory trends. Overall, even though the absence of 
evidence of inferiority does not imply that non-inferiority has been proved, it should also be taken 
into account that, after the observation by Tong at al. (Blood 2014) that the use of native E coli 
asparaginase in first-line induction led to high hypersensitivity rates to PEGasparaginase in the 
subsequent intensification phase (the so called silent inactivation), in the clinical practice the use of 
native E. coli L-asparaginase in first-line has seen a significant reduction. In patients treated with 
PEGasparaginase in first line there is no clinical rationale to switch to native asparaginase in second 
line, due to the potential occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore the issue of the lack of 
compelling comparative data between Oncaspar and native asparaginase in the second line is 
considered to not significantly impact on the efficacy assessment of Oncaspar. 
Based on the totality of the data, the use of Oncaspar in patients non-hypersensitive to native 
asparaginase in first line and in second line is considered adequate. However, the CHMP considered 
that further data were needed to further characterise the efficacy of Oncaspar in this subpopulation 
of patients who are non-hypersensitive to native asparaginase. Therefore, the Applicant will submit 
results from a post- authorisation efficacy study CAALL-F01 to further investigate the efficacy,

safety and PK/PD/immunogenicity of Oncaspar when used in first-line in paediatric setting. The 
final clinical study report is expected by 31 December 2025 (Annex II condition). Interim report 
after 3 year of inclusion will be provided by 31 December 2019 as detailed in the RMP. 
Most of the trials have been performed in children, adolescents and young adults. However, it is 
considered shown that asparaginase has a benefit in ALL adult patients based on available 
literature data (see supportive studies). Therefore, the CHMP does not recommend a restriction of 
the use of Oncaspar according to age.  
Furthermore, additional efficacy data will be provided in this subpopulation (adult patients) from a 
clinical trial investigating safety and efficacy when Oncaspar is used in the first-line treatment 
along with multi-agent chemotherapy in adults with ALL (Annex II condition). The final study report 
of this a post- authorisation efficacy study is to be provided by 31 December 2018. This trial will 
also provide further supportive data to characterise the efficacy of Oncaspar in patients non-
hypersensitive to asparaginase. 
No data are available in high risk ALL Ph+ patients and, as a consequence, a warning has been 
included in the SmPC of Oncaspar (see SmPC section 4.4). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the provided data support the efficacy of Oncaspar in ALL patients who are hypersensitive 
to native asparaginase. In addition, the many studies supporting the efficacy of the product, and 
the clinical experience that has been gained on this product in post-marketing, efficacy can be 
considered established in patients non-hypersensitive to native asparaginase both in first line and 
second treatment. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The CHMP consider that additional data are necessary to confirm the benefit of Oncaspar in the 
subgroup of ALL patients who are non-hypersensitive to native asparaginase and in the subgroup 
of adult patients with ALL respectively:

•  The original package submitted in the second-line MAA filed in 1994 in Germany (studies ASP-
001, ASP-001C/ASP-003, ASP-102, ASP-201A, ASP-203, ASP-302, ASP-304 and ASP-400). These 
data are mostly on patients hypersensitive to native E.coli ASNase before exposure to PEG-
ASNase; 
•  Studies performed to support the first-line indication in US (studies CCG-1961, CCG-1962, 
DFCI-87-001 and DFCI-91-01). Study CCG-1991 is also included in this group, although PEG-
ASNase is part of the background therapy. The majority of patients included in this study were 
naive to asparaginase and therefore can be considered not-hypersensitive; 
•  Post-marketing use, including data collected by the original MAH of pegasparagase in EU (PSUR 
version 4.0), data from commercialisation in US and those from academic, studies in which PEG-
ASNase is part of a combination regimen (i.e, AIEOP-BFM, ALL-2009, ALL-MB 2008, CO-ALL-08-09,

PEGASP.1/Adults, NOPHO ALL2008, UK ALL 2011, UK ALL14). 
The majority of the clinical trials enrolled ALL paediatric patients, but other haematological 
malignancies (e.g, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma) were also represented. In addition, adult patients with 
solid tumours and NHL were included in study ASP-102 and ASP-203. 
Preliminary safety data of study AALL07P4, that is part of the development program for a new 
pegylated ASNase and in which PEG-ASNase was used as a control treatment, were also submitted. 
Patient exposure 
Patient exposure from clinical trial experience was 5,304 patients and in post-marketing experience 
was 91,833 patients. The paediatric population represented the main target population for 
pegasparagase (more than 95%). The IM route of administration was mainly used during clinical 
trials (more than 95%). 
The method used to calculate patient exposure was as follows: The average dosage per patient per 
application is established as 3,750 IU (content of a single vial of pegasparagase) and the average 
duration of treatment as four applications per patient. Therefore, the number of patients exposed 
to pegasparagase was calculated as an average dose of 15,000 IU per patient.

Overall data on exposure are available for second line studies. 
PEG-ASNase was administered intravenously in 92 patients (18 hypersensitive and 74 non- 
hypersensitive), while the intramuscular route was used in 158 patients (60 hypersensitive and 98 
non- hypersensitive). 
Table 64: Summary of PEG-ASNase doses and routes of administration 
Overall, 384 doses were administered to the 78 hypersensitive patients and 650 to the non-
hypersensitive patients. 
Long term safety data (defined as any patient who received >2 doses of PEG-ASNase which is 
equivalent to at least 4 weeks of therapy with native E coli L-asparaginase) were available for 121 
patients.  
The range of treatment days and the number doses of PEG-ASNase for the hypersensitive and non-
hypersensitive patients are presented below: 
Table 65: Summary of days on study for patients on PEG-ASNase therapy 
The median number of days on study was 43 (range 1 to 640 days) for all patients, 43 days (range 
1  to  559  days)  for  the  hypersensitive  patients  and  43  days  (range  1  to  640  days)  for  the  non-
hypersensitive patients.  
Table 66: Summary of PEG-ASNase doses for patients on therapy 
The median number of doses administered was 2 (range 1 to 37 doses) for all patients, 2 (range 1 
to  29  doses)  for  the  hypersensitive  patients,  and  3  (range  1  to  37  doses)  for  the  non-
hypersensitive patients.

Regarding studies investigating first line use, the extent of exposure to study medication has been 
retrieved  for  study  CCG-1962  for  whom  a  clinical  study  report  has  been  provided.  Details  are 
reported in the following table: 
Table 67: Extent of exposure to PEG-ASNase and native ASNase in CCG-1962

In study DFCI-05-001, the target number of doses administered for each treatment arm (30 for 
native E. coli ASP administered weekly and 15 for PEG-ASP [pegasparagase] administered every 2 
weeks) in the first line treatment of ALL is shown in the Table below.

Based on data from Periodic Safety Update Reports and sales data, it is estimated that PEG-
ASNase has been used to treat more than 42.000 in European countries and further 57.000 
patients in other regions including North America. 
Therefore, the overall estimated number of patients treated with PEG-ASNase through 20 years is 
over 100.000, combining clinical trials and commercial use.  
Adverse events 
The applicant's safety databases include data from all available sources (i.e. clinical trials, 
spontaneous reporting and published literature). The total number of patients covered by the 
safety database is estimated at 101,200.  
The table is the result of combining sub-tables corresponding to reports of adverse events following 
exposure to Oncaspar Supplier M (n=50,646), Oncaspar Supplier K (n=31,477) and Oncaspar 
Supplier L (n=19,077).

Results from the following eight clinical studies were provided: ASP-001, ASP-001C, ASP-102, ASP-
201A, ASP-203, ASP-302, ASP-304 and ASP-400.  Two-hundred-and-fifty (250) patients were 
assessable for safety in all second-line studies.  
IM administration: A total of 57 (44%) of the 126 patients reported CTC grade 3 or 4 non-allergic 
reactions, which were possibly, probably or definitely related to pegasparagase. Changes in 
coagulation profiles were noted in 31 patients. Changes in liver function tests were noted in 41 
patients. A total of 3 patients reported other CTC grade 3 or 4 non-allergic, known L-asparaginase 
toxicities (other than chemical coagulopathies and chemical hepatotoxicities), which were possibly, 
probably or definitely related to pegasparagase. The probability of not developing a non-allergic 
CTC grade 3 or 4 reaction by the third dose for the 60 hypersensitive and 66 non-hypersensitive 
patients was 58% and 13%, respectively. 
IV administration: A total of 47 of the 92 patients reported CTC grade 3 or 4 non-allergic toxicities, 
which were possibly, probably or definitely related to pegasparagase. Changes in coagulation 
profiles were noted in 11 patients. Changes in liver function tests (CTC grades 3 and 4) were noted 
in 35 patients (38%). The probability of not developing a non-allergic CTC grade 3 or 4 reaction by 
the third dose for the 18 hypersensitive and 74 non-hypersensitive patients was 49% and 48%, 
respectively. 
Safety regardless of route of administration: A total of 104 (48%) of the 218 patients (26 
hypersensitive and 78 non-hypersensitive) who received pegasparagase reported CTC grade 3 or 4 
non-allergic toxicities, which were possibly, probably or definitely related to pegasparagase. 
Changes in coagulation profiles were noted in 42 patients. Changes in liver function tests were 
noted in 76 patients. Finally, six patients (3%) experienced CTC grade 3 increases in BUN and 2 
(1%) had neurological dysfunctions. 
Study ASP-304 
The  most  frequently  occurring  toxicities  (regardless  of  CTC  grade),  were  hepatotoxicity  and 
coagulopathy, the majority of which were laboratory abnormalities without clinical manifestations. 
An examination of the expended toxicologic data demonstrated that there was a high incidence of 
hypoproteinemia observed during induction therapy for this study. Although 16 (40%) of 40 
pegasparagase direct assigned patients, 9 (47%) of 19 randomized pegasparagase patients and 11 
(65%) of 17 Elspar patients experienced hypoproteinemia during therapy, there was no significant 
difference in incidence between the two randomized treatment groups (p=0.335). There were no 
incidences of bleeding disorders or increased creatinine in any of the treatment groups. The overall

incidence of known L-asparaginase toxicities which occurred during induction therapy similar for 
randomized pegasparagase and Elspar patients, with coagulopathy being the only toxicity 
demonstrating a significant difference (p=0.003) in favour of the pegasparagase patients. Of all of 
the coagulation abnormalities reported (regardless of CTC grade), decreased fibrinogen 
demonstrated a significant difference between the two randomized patient populations during 
therapy (p=0.006). 
Fifteen (79%) of 19 patients randomized to pegasparagase had a total of 26 drug related adverse 
experiences with an average duration of 10.3 days. The most common (greater than ten percent) 
ONCASPAR related adverse experiences were hypoproteinemia (47%), increased SGPT (32%) and 
hyperbilirubinemia (16%), decreased fibrinogen (11%), and increased partial thromboplastin time 
(11%). There was no difference in the incidence of adverse experiences between the "regardless of 
relationship to study drug" and ''related to study drug" tables. 
Thirty-three (83%) of 40 patients directly assigned to pegasparagase had a total of 75 drug related 
adverse experiences with an average duration of 13.5 days. The most common (greater than five 
percent) oncaspar related adverse experiences were increased SGPT (45%), hypoproteinemia 
(40%), decreased fibrinogen (30%), increased partial thromboplastin time (15%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (15%), and fever (8%) and allergic reactions. The only adverse experiences 
that demonstrated an increased frequency of occurrence from the "related to study drug" to 
"regardless of relationship to study drug" tables were fever (from 8% to 10%) and urticaria (from 
3% to 8%). 
The most frequent adverse events observed in second-line use studies, (except immunological 
events) were abnormal liver test (hyperbilirubinemia, increased SGPT/SGOT, decreased albumin, 
hypoproteinemia and fatty liver), pancreatitis (hyperamylaseamia), coagulopathy (decreased 
fibrinogen, increased partial thromboplastin time), central nervous system thrombosis. Other 
adverse events (less frequent) were gastro-intestinal disorder (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea), chills, 
fever, neurologic disorder (peripheral neuritis, pain in extremity). 
First line treatment 
Results taken from the following four clinical studies were provided: CCG-1962, CCG-1991, DFCI-
87-001 and DFCI-91-01. 
Study  CCG-1962:  Infections  were  the  most  toxic  events.  As  regards  CNS  thrombosis,  among  the 
occurrence in the PEG-ASNase treatment, one occurred during induction and the second Day 22 of 
delayed  intensification  #1.  As  regards  pancreatitis,  one  event  occurred  in  each  arm  during 
induction.  There  were  two  additional  occurrences  of  pancreatitis  in  the  PEG-ASNase  group  and 
during  delayed  intensification  #2.  For  some  other  adverse  events  (allergic  events,  pancreatitis, 
abdominal  pain),  more  cases  have  been  reported  with  pegasparagase  than  with  Elspar.  As  an 
example,  there  were  3  cases  of  pancreatitis  with  pegasparagase  versus  1  case  for  native 
asparaginase  whatever  the  treatment  phase.  There  was  however  no  quantitative  measurable 
difference in the safety profile between pegasparagase and Elspar.  
Study  CCG-1991:  The  main  reported  adverse  events  were  immune  system  disorders,  CNS 
disorders, blood and lymphatic systems and gastrointestinal disorders. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse event 
From the initiation of the pegasparagase program on March 31, 1984 through to the cut-off date 
for the analysis of May 31, 1990, 28 serious adverse drug experiences were reported to the United 
States FDA. Fifteen of these reports occurred with the intravenous administration of pegasparagase 
during study ASP-001. Eight of these 15 reports from ASP-001 were on-study deaths due to 
Assessment report

progressive disease. These deaths were expected because at study entry the patients had life 
expectancies of approximately six weeks. In addition, 4 other disease-related deaths were reported 
for studies ASP-201A, ASP-203 and ASP-302. Thirteen other patients reported serious adverse 
drug experiences which included anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, convulsions, CNS haemorrhage, 
disorientation, pancreatitis, thrombosis, paresthesia, a systemic hypersensitivity reaction and 
haemolytic anaemia. None of the 10 E coli L-asparaginase patients, to the applicant's knowledge, 
experienced any serious adverse experiences. 
Study CCG-1962: A total of five patients (4.2%) had non-fatal SAEs (3 Peg-asp patients and 2 
native asp patients). The following SAEs were reported: Grade 3 or 4 coagulopathy, Grade 3or 4 
pancreatitis, and Grade 4 neurologic dysfunction; foot pain; Grade 4 CNS toxicity; and Grade 3 or 
4 coagulopathy and Grade 4 neurologic dysfunction. 
Deaths 
There were 102 deaths among the 250 patients treated with pegasparagase in the clinical trials 
investigating second-line use of pegasparagase. Of these deaths, 22 occurred on-study and 80 off-
study. The off-study deaths occurred between 2 and 453 days after study termination. All deaths, 
were considered to be disease-related. There were 5 deaths among the 10 patients treated with 
native E coli-derived L-asparaginase in the clinical trials investigating second-line use of 
pegasparagase. All these deaths were considered to be disease-related and all occurred off-study 
between 62 and 307 days after study termination. 
Clinical study reports and publications for studies in which pegasparagase was used in first-line 
therapy (CCG-1961, CCG, 1962, CCG-1991, DFCI-87-001 and DFCI-91-01) identify 39 deaths of 
which 32 occurred in patients receiving pegasparagase, 6 in patients treated with native E coli-
derived L-asparaginase and 1 in a patient treated with Erwinia-derived enzyme. None of these 
deaths was specifically attributed to asparaginase therapy. 
Immunological events  
Data on immunological events are based on studies that supported the Marketing Authorization in 
1994. The main allergic AEs are urticarial, rash, dyspnea, bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypotension 
and anaphylactic shock. One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) has been 
described.  
The analysis of patients included in the 1994 MAA for whom both the following were as follows: 
• 
• 
Nature and grade of hypersensitivity reaction to native asparaginase. 
Nature and grade of hypersensitivity reaction to pegasparagase 
8 of the 13 patients with previous Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions did not experience any 
hypersensitivity after pegasparagase administration (61.5%). Two patients had a Grade 1 reaction 
(15.4%), 2 had a Grade 2 reaction (15.4%) and 1 patient had a Grade 4 reaction (7.7%). Only 1 
patient (7.7%) with previous Grade 4 hypersensitivity to native enzyme had a hypersensitivity 
reaction >Grade 2 when given pegasparagase. A similar analysis has been conducted for patients 
who suffered a Grade 3 reaction to native asparaginase prior to treatment with pegasparagase. 17 
of the 21 patients with previous Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions did not experience any 
hypersensitivity after pegasparagase administration (81%). Two patients had a Grade 1 reaction 
(10%) and 2 had a Grade 3 reaction (10%). There were no Grade 2 or Grade 4 reactions. Only 2 
patients (10%) with previous Grade 3 hypersensitivity to native enzyme had a hypersensitivity 
reaction >Grade 2 when given pegasparagase. 
Study CCG-1962: There were two hypersensitivity reactions in the pegasparagase treatment group 
(3.4%); one case of Grade 1 allergy and one case of Grade 3 hives. No cases of hypersensitivity to 
native asparaginase were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 104/122 
 
 
  
Study CCG-1991: In accordance with the study protocol, Grade 1 & 2 allergic reactions were not 
recorded. 
There were 9 reports of Grade 3 hypersensitivity and 5 reports of Grade 4 hypersensitivity (14 
reports in all; 0.5%). The exact nature of the hypersensitivity reactions was not reported. 
Study AALL07P4: There were 20 hypersensitivity reactions recorded in 15 patients. The main 
allergic AEs are urticarial, rash, dyspnea, bronchospasm, tachycardia, hypotension and 
anaphylactic shock. One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) has been described. 
The probability of Grade 3/4 toxicity in hypersensitive patients was higher with PEG-ASNase 
administered intravenously than intramuscular. Data supporting the role of neutralising antibodies 
in leading the different risk based on route of administration were not available. 
Post-marketing 
Post-marketing ADRs of hypersensitivity reports received during 1984 to 2014 via safety reports 
that include US, Canada, and EU were analysed. Postmarketing safety data were retrieved from the 
Applicant’s Drug Safety Database and the hypersensitivity reactions reported remains 
approximately 13.7% of all reported postmarketing adverse drug reactions. Overall, allergic 
reactions/hypersensitivity in the 3 clinical studies with CSRs using PEG-ASP  in first line ALL 
patients did not reach the 54%, as reported for CCG-1961 ( CCG-1962, 5%; DFCI-05-001, 12%; 
AALL07P4, 9.8% hypersensitivity and 19.6% anaphylactic reaction). In the publication for study 
CCG-1962, Seibel et al (2008) reported that 54% of patients treated on increased intensity post-
induction intensification arms experienced an allergic reaction to PEG-ASNase. However, there is no 
indication of the seriousness or severity of these allergic reactions in the publication or whether 
these events occurred in the longer duration or standard duration PII phases. No further 
information on hypersensitivity or allergic reactions were reported in available publications. 
Laboratory findings

A total of 55 terms were reported. Of these, 34 terms (62%) were reported fewer than 5 times and 
a further 11 terms (20%) were reported 5-9 times.  
Three terms were reported 10-14 times (aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) increased, 
hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia). Regarding age distribution: 
•  8/12 cases of ASAT increase were in adults and 5 of these were in patients aged ≥40 years.  
•  10/12 cases of hyperlipidaemia were in children, while the remaining 2 cases were in patients of 
unknown age.  
•  Hyperglycaemia appeared to be evenly distributed across the age range. Two terms were 
reported 15-19 times (blood triglycerides increased and neutropenia).  
•  For neutropenia, 8/15 cases (53%) occurred in patients aged 2 to <12 years.  
Five terms were reported >20 times: 
•  There were 22 cases of increased alanine aminotransferase (ALAT). 19/22 (86%) occurred in 
adults and 12/22 (55%) were in patients aged ≥40 years. 
•  There were 23 reports of abnormal liver function. A high proportion of these reports did not 
include the age of the patient (6/23; 26%). Nevertheless, an increasing risk with advancing age 
appears likely with 13/23 reports (57%) occurring in adults and 7/23 (30%) in those aged ≥40 
years. 
•  There were 27 reports of febrile neutropenia, increasing risk with age as 20/27 reports (74%) 
concerned adults. Most cases (13/27; 48%) were in young adults aged 18-40 years. 
•  There were 30 reports of increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) of which 29/30 (97%) were in 
adults and the age of the other case was unknown. The majority of reports (22/30; 73%) were in 
patients aged ≥40 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016

•  There were 52 reports of increased blood bilirubin. Here again, older patients were more at risk 
with 42/52 cases (81%) occurring in adults and 35/52 (67%) occurring in patients aged ≥40 
years. 
Regarding neutropenia, 10/12 reports for which the patient's age is known (83%) occurred in 
children. However, for febrile neutropenia the situation is reversed with 21/25 cases for which the 
patient's age is known (84%) occurring in adults. 
Combining the 2 terms and disregarding reports for which the patients' ages are not known: 
•  There were 14 cases of neutropenia in children of which 4 were febrile (29%). 
•  There were 23 cases of neutropenia in adults, of which 21 were febrile (91%). 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy 
A single case of pegasparagase use in a pregnant woman was reported to the applicant. The 
patient concerned was 28 weeks pregnant and received 2 doses of pegasparagase i.m. which was 
well tolerated (no coagulopathy, mild hypertriglyceridaemia). The foetus reportedly gained 260g in 
the 3-week interval between the first pharmacovigilance communication (believed to be pre-
pegasparagase dosing) and the follow-up notification confirming that two doses of pegasparagase 
had been administered. Delivery was induced at 33 weeks and resulted in a female child weighing 
2,113g. Foetal hypoxia was noted during delivery. Cardiac ultrasound revealed multiple muscular 
septal defects. In the literature, 6 cases of pregnancy (and 7 births) have been reported with an 
exposure to L-asparaginase during the second and third trimester of pregnancy (Okun 1979, 
Khurshid 1978, Karp 1983, Awidi 1983, Turchi 1988, Schlieuning 1987). However, no case has 
been reported with an exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. 
Concerning foetotoxic effect of ONCASPAR, leucopenia has been reported in two cases in new-
borns following in utero exposure to L-asparaginase in combination with others therapies (Okun 
1979, Khurshid 1978). 
There is no data submitted on pegaspargase excretion into breast milk. 
Age 
The majority of the clinical data has been collected in patients 2-21 years old, especially in second 
line clinical trials which almost exclusively featured patients in this age range. Broader age 
representation has been accumulated in first-line ALL clinical studies, in study INTERFANT-06 
(specifically for infants aged <1 year), and commercial sales.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant did not submit studies on drug-drug interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Thirty-seven patients (14 patients hypersensitive and 23 non-hypersensitive) had their treatment 
with pegasparagase discontinued due to adverse experiences. Seventeen patients (12 
hypersensitive and 5 non-hypersensitive) experienced either local or systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions (CTC grades 1 to 4). Ten patients (2 hypersensisitive and 8 non-hypersensisitve) 
experienced non-allergic toxicities (CTC grades 1 to 4) to pegasparagase and 1 non-hypersensitive 
patients from studies ASP-102 and ASP-103 experienced known L-asparaginase toxicities to 
pegasparagase. These toxicities included chemical coagulopathy and hepatoxicity, gastrointestinal 
disorders, disorientation, thrombosis, convulsion, nausea, weight loss, erythema simplex, myalgia 
and pain at the injection site.

Post marketing experience 
Exposure data are presented under patient exposure.  
Medac was the original MA holder for pegasparagase in the EU and remained so until the 
authorisation was transferred to the Sigma-Tau group 2012. 
The latest available Medac PSUR (version 4.0) for pegasparagase summarised the safety data 
received from worldwide sources between August 2009 and July 2012. In addition to the German 
and Polish MAs, authorisations in Argentina, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine were 
included in the PSUR scope. US post-authorisation data were excluded. 
Approximately 207,352,500 IU of product were sold worldwide during the monitoring period for 
PSUR version 4.0 which corresponded to an estimated number of 13,824 treated patients. Overall, 
93 case reports were received. These included 128 listed reactions and 9 unlisted reactions (4 of 
which were serious). Of these, 27 were spontaneous reports received from regulatory authorities 
and health professionals, 55 were derived from studies and the remaining 11 cases were identified 
in literature. 
The 4 unlisted serious reports were hyponatremia (n=2), acute cholangitis (n=1) and 
aemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n=1). 
It was concluded in the PSUR that these data did not change the risk / benefit profile of Ocaspar 
and no regulatory action was taken. 
Data from commercialisation in the US 
A preferred term analysis of 843 post-authorisation safety reports covering reaction onset dates 
from September 1994 to March 2012 was submitted. This covers a period during which the total 
exposure to pegasparagase in the territories concerned is estimated at approximately 57.000.

The data shows that there were 25 spontaneous reports. The first-listed events were 
hypersensitivity (n=11), hypertriglyceridemia (n=3), pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, sepsis and 
depressed consciousness (n=2 each) and renal failure, infection and disease progression (n=1 
each). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The submitted safety data were taken from a limited number of well-designed or up to date 
studies. Additional safety data were presented based on spontaneous reporting and published 
literature data. 
Patient exposure can be considered as substantial from both clinical trial experience (5,304 
patients) and post-marketing (91,833 patients). The paediatric population represents the main 
target population for pegasparagase (more than 95%). IM route of administration has been mainly 
used during clinical trials (more than 95%). 
Adverse events 
The safety data were taken from the following eight clinical studies: ASP-001, ASP-001C, ASP-102, 
ASP-201A, ASP-203, ASP-302, ASP-304 and ASP-400.  Two-hundred-and-fifty (250) patients were 
assessable for safety in all second-line studies.  
Overall, the most frequent adverse events observed in second-line use studies (except 
immunological events) are abnormal liver test (hyperbilirubinemia, increased SGPT/SGOT, 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 109/122 
 
 
  
 
decreased albumin, hypoproteinemia and fatty liver), pancreatitis (hyperamylaseamia), 
coagulopathy (decreased fibrinogen, increased partial thromboplastin time), and central nervous 
system thrombosis. Other adverse events (less frequent) are gastro-intestinal disorder (nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhoea), chills, fever, neurologic disorder (peripheral neuritis, pain in extremity). 
For patients that received IM administration, a total of 57 (44%) of the 126 patients reported CTC 
grade 3 or 4 non-allergic reactions, which were possibly, probably or definitely related to 
pegasparagase. Changes in coagulation profiles were noted in 31 patients. Changes in liver 
function tests were noted in 41 patients. A total of 3 patients reported other CTC grade 3 or 4 non-
allergic, known L-asparaginase toxicities (other than chemical coagulopathies and chemical 
hepatotoxicities), which were possibly, probably or definitely related to pegasparagase. The 
probability of not developing a non-allergic CTC grade 3 or 4 reaction by the third dose for the 60 
hypersensitive and 66 non-hypersensitive patients was 58% and 13%, respectively. 
For patients that received IV administration, a total of 47 (51%) of the 92 patients reported CTC 
grade 3 or 4 non-allergic toxicities, which were possibly, probably or definitely related to 
pegasparagase. Changes in coagulation profiles were noted in 11 patients. Changes in liver 
function tests (CTC grades 3 and 4) were noted in 35 patients (38%). The probability of not 
developing a non-allergic CTC grade 3 or 4 reaction by the third dose for the 18 hypersensitive and 
74 non-hypersensitive patients was 49% and 48%, respectively. 
For the safety in patients regardless of route of administration, a total of 104 (48%) of the 218 
patients (26 hypersensitive and 78 non-hypersensitive) who received pegasparagase reported CTC 
grade 3 or 4 non-allergic toxicities, which were possibly, probably or definitely related to 
pegasparagase. Changes in coagulation profiles were noted in 42 patients. Changes in liver 
function tests were noted in 76 patients. Finally, six patients (3%) experienced CTC grade 3 
increases in BUN and 2 (1%) had neurological dysfunctions. 
Although a difference in the rate of patients that undergo allergic AE between the two routes of 
administration was observed (51% with intravenous administration versus 44% with intramuscular 
administration), no statistical comparison was performed between the routes of administration for 
non-immunological adverse events. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Based on all 
available data, it is considered that Oncaspar can be given by intramuscular injection or 
intravenous infusion. For smaller volumes of Oncaspar, the preferred route of administration is 
intramuscular. Safety following IV route of administration will continue to be monitored as reflected 
in the RMP. 
The safety data in first line treatment were taken from studies CCG-1962 and CCG-1991. 
Study CCG-1962 
Overall, the incidences and types of toxic events were very similar between PEG-ASNase and 
native E.coli ASNase arms. Infections were the most toxic events. CNS thrombosis, among the 
occurrence in the PEG-ASNase treatment, occurred once during induction and the second Day 22 of 
delayed intensification #1. Pancreatitis occurred once in each arm during induction. 
Study CCG-1991 
The main reported adverse events were immune system disorders, CNS disorders, blood and 
lymphatic systems and gastrointestinal disorders.  
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Oncaspar can cause mild to moderate myelosuppression, and all three blood cell lines can be 
affected. About half of all serious haemorrhages and thromboses affect cerebral vessels and can 
lead e.g. to stroke, seizures, headache or loss of consciousness. Myelosuppression and associated 
effects (including infections) has been identified as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 110/122 
 
 
  
Considering that oncaspar may possess immunosuppressive activity, it is possible that use of this it 
promotes infections in patients (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The decrease in the number of circulating lymphoblasts is often quite marked, and normal or too 
low leukocyte counts are often seen in the first days after the start of therapy. This can be 
associated with a marked rise in the serum uric acid level. Uric acid nephropathy may develop. To 
monitor the therapeutic effect, the peripheral blood count and the patient’s bone marrow should be 
monitored closely (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders 
Oncaspar may cause Central Nervous System dysfunctions manifesting as convulsion, and less 
frequently confusional state and somnolence (mildly impaired consciousness). In rare cases, a 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) may occur. In very rare cases, mild 
tremor in the fingers has been described. Neurotoxicity has been identified as an important 
identified risk in the RMP. Reversible posterior leukencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been 
inlcuded as an important potential risk. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
About half of patients develop mild to moderate gastrointestinal reactions such as loss of appetite, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and weight loss. 
Acute pancreatitis can occur commonly. There have been isolated reports of formation of 
pseudocysts (up to four months after the last treatment). Appropriate investigations (e.g. 
ultrasound) should therefore be performed up to four months after termination of Oncaspar 
therapy. As the precise pathogenesis is unknown, only supportive measures can be recommended. 
Disturbances of exocrine pancreatic function can result in diarrhoea. Pancreatitis has been 
identified as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Haemorrhagic or necrotising pancreatitis occurs rarely. One case of pancreatitis with simultaneous 
acute parotitis has been described with L-asparaginase treatment. In single cases, haemorrhagic or 
necrotising pancreatitis with fatal outcome has been reported. Serum amylase can rise during and 
also after the conclusion of Oncaspar therapy. Haemorrhage has been identified as an important 
identified risk in the RMP. 
Blood and urine glucose levels should be monitored during treatment with Oncaspar as they may 
rise. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Acute renal failure may develop in rare cases during treatment with L-asparaginase-containing 
regimens.  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Allergic reactions can manifest in the skin. One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell‘s 
syndrome) has been described in association with L-asparaginase. 
Endocrine disorders 
Alterations in endocrine pancreatic function are observed commonly and are expressed mainly in 
the form of abnormal glucose metabolism. Both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar 
hyperglycaemia have been described, which generally respond to administration of exogenous 
insulin. Hyperglycaemia has been identified as an importna identified risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 111/122 
 
 
  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
An alteration in serum lipid levels was observed and changes in serum lipid values, in most cases 
without clinical symptoms, are very common. A rise in serum urea occurs regularly, is dose-
independent and nearly always a sign of pre-renal metabolic imbalance. Hyperlipidaemia has been 
identified as an importna identified risk in the RMP. 
General disorders and administration side conditions 
Pyrexia can occur after the injection, which usually subsides spontaneously.  
Hepatobiliary disorders 
Alteration of liver parameters are very common. A dose-independent rise in serum transaminases, 
and serum bilirubin is commonly observed. Fatty liver can be observed very frequently. There have 
been rare reports of cholestasis, icterus, hepatic cell necrosis and hepatic failure with fatal 
outcome. Impaired protein synthesis can lead to a decline in the serum proteins. There is a dose-
independent decrease in serum albumin in the majority of patients during the treatment. The range 
of side effects of Oncaspar largely coincides with that of native non-pegylated L-asparaginase (e.g. 
native E. coli asparaginase). Hepatotoxicity has been identified as an important identified risk in 
the RMP. 
Adverse events with a long latency have been included as missing information in the RMP. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
From the initiation of the pegasparagase program on March 31, 1984 through to the cut-off date 
for this analysis of May 31, 1990, 28 serious adverse drug experiences were reported to the United 
States FDA. Fifteen of these reports occurred with the intravenous administration of pegasparagase 
during study ASP-001. Eight of these 15 reports from ASP-001 were on-study deaths due to 
progressive disease. These deaths were expected because at study entry the patients had life 
expectancies of approximately six weeks. In addition, 4 other disease-related deaths were reported 
for studies ASP-201A, ASP-203 and ASP-302. Thirteen other patients reported serious adverse 
drug experiences which included anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, convulsions, CNS haemorrhage, 
disorientation, pancreatitis, thrombosis, paresthesia, a systemic hypersensitivity reaction and 
haemolytic anaemia. None of the 10 E coli L-asparaginase patients experienced any serious 
adverse experiences. For Study CCG-1962, a total of five patients (4.2%) had non-fatal SAEs (3 
Peg-asp patients and 2 native asp patients). The following SAEs were reported: Grade 3 or 4 
coagulopathy, Grade 3or 4 pancreatitis, and Grade 4 neurologic dysfunction; foot pain; Grade 4 
CNS toxicity; and Grade 3 or 4 coagulopathy and Grade 4 neurologic dysfunction. 
Therefore, the SmPC section 4.3 contains contraindications for patients with hypersensitivity to the 
active substance or to any of the excipients listed in SmPC section 6.1, history of serious 
thrombosis with prior L-asparaginase therapy, history of pancreatitis including pancreatitis related 
to prior L-asparaginase therapy (see SmPC section 4.4) and history of serious hemorrhagic events 
with prior L-asparaginase therapy (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity reactions to Oncaspar, e.g. life-threatening anaphylaxis, can occur during the 
therapy, particularly in patients with known hypersensitivity to the other forms of L-asparaginase. 
As a routine precautionary measure the patient should be monitored for an hour after 
administration, having resuscitation equipment and other means required for the treatment of 
anaphylaxis in readiness (epinephrine, oxygen, intravenous steroids etc.). Oncaspar should be 
discontinued in patients with serious allergic reactions (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).  Depending on 
the severity of the symptoms, administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids and possibly 
circulation-stabilising medical product is indicated as counter-measure. Hypersensitivity has been 
identified as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 112/122 
 
 
  
Serious thrombotic events, including sagittal sinus thrombosis can occur in patients receiving 
Oncaspar. Oncaspar should be discontinued in patients with serious thrombotic events.  
Thromboembolic events have been identified as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
There have been reported adverse reactions of pancreatitis. Patients should be informed of the 
characteristic symptom of pancreatitis that, if left untreated, could become fatal: persistent 
abdominal pain that could be severe, which may radiate to the back. If pancreatitis is suspected, 
Oncaspar should be discontinued; if pancreatitis is confirmed, Oncaspar should not be restarted. 
Appropriate investigations (e.g. ultrasound) should therefore be performed up to four months after 
termination of Oncaspar therapy. As the precise pathogenesis is unknown, only supportive 
measures can be recommended. Disturbances of exocrine pancreatic function can result in 
diarrhoea. 
Serum amylase measurements should be carried out frequently to identify early signs of 
inflammation of the pancreas.  
Increased prothrombin time (PT), increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and 
hypofibrinogenemia can occur in patients receiving Oncaspar. Coagulation parameters should be 
monitored at baseline and periodically during and after treatment; particularly when other 
medicinal products with coagulation-inhibiting effects such as acetylsalicylic acid and nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory medicinal products are used simultaneously (see SmPC section 4.5).  
Regular monitoring of the coagulation profile is necessary. Fibrinogen can be regarded as a 
parameter of the pro- and anticoagulatory system. When there is a marked drop in fibrinogen or 
AntithrombinIII (ATIII) deficiency, consider targeted substitution (e.g. fresh frozen plasma). 
Combination therapy with Oncaspar can result in severe hepatic toxicity and central nervous 
system toxicity. 
Caution is required when Oncaspar is given in combination with other hepatotoxic substances, 
especially if there is pre-existing hepatic impairment. In this case, patients should be monitored for 
liver impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 times upper limit of normal [ULN]; transaminases > 10 
times ULN) is also a contraindication (see SmPC section 4.3). 
In the presence of symptoms of hyperammonemia (e.g. nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritation), 
ammonia levels should be monitored closely (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Safety and efficacy in Philadelphia chromosome-positive patients has not been established. A 
possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity when combining imatinib with L-asparaginase therapy 
should be taken into account prior deciding to use Oncaspar in this patient population (see SmPC 
section 4.4). 
Safety in special populations 
There have been no further published cases of leucopenia following in utero exposure to L-
asparaginase in the 36 years since. The two published case reports mentioned in the question pre-
date pegasparagase by more than a decade. The history of commercial pegasparagase use covers 
more than 20 years, during which time it is estimated that almost 70,000 patients have been 
exposed. No case of leucopenia following in utero exposure has been reported during this period. 
Therefore, there is no need to include the theoretical risk of leucopenia in the SmPC. However, the 
applicant has updated the RMP with the 2 case reports referred to in the question and, in the event 
of a spontaneous case of pregnancy being reported in a patient undergoing treatment with 
pegasparagase, routine pharmacovigilance practice would ensure that all pregnancies are followed 
up and any problems with mother or foetus would be identified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 113/122 
 
 
  
There are limited amount of data from the use of L-asparaginase and no data from the use of 
Oncaspar, in pregnant women. No reproduction studies in animals with pegaspargase were 
performed but studies in animals with L-asparaginase have shown teratogenicity (see section 5.3). 
Taking into account teratogenic effects of L-asparaginase observed in rat and rabbit studies and 
due to its pharmacological properties, Oncaspar should not be used during pregnancy unless the 
clinical conditions of the woman requires treatment with pegaspargase. This is in line with the 
guideline on risk assessment of medicinal product on human reproduction and lactation: from data 
to labelling (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). Teratogenicity has been identified as an important 
identified risk in the RMP. Effective contraception must be used during treatment and for at least 6 
months after Oncaspar discontinuation. Since an indirect interaction between components of the 
oral contraception and pegaspargase cannot be ruled out, oral contraceptives are not considered 
sufficiently safe in such clinical situation (see sections SmPC 4.5 and 4.6). 
Concerning the breast feeding, it is not known whether pegaspargase is excreted into breast milk. 
Based on its pharmacological properties any risk to the breastfed newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. As a precautionary measure, breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with Oncaspar and should not be resumed after discontinuation of Oncaspar. The use of Oncaspar 
in pregnant or lactating women has been included as missing information in the RMP. 
There is limited data available for patients older than 65 years. Therefore, the safety in elderly 
patients has been included as missing information in the RMP. 
There is limited information in patients with severe liver impairment and patients with renal 
impairment. Therefore the safety in these patients will be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP 
under missing information. 
Immunological events 
The main described allergic AEs are urticarial, rash, dyspnea, bronchospasm, tachycardia, 
hypotension and anaphylactic shock. One case of toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell’s syndrome) has 
been described. The overall rate of hypersensitivity reactions with pegasparagase has been 
reasonably stable taking in consideration the large patient exposure over 20 years. The data 
presented does not suggest an increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions over time. 
Specific antibodies to pegaspargase have been measured; uncommonly they were associated to 
hypersensitivity reactions. Neutralising antibody reducing clinical efficacy were also recorded. 
Immunogenicity has been included as a potential risk in the RMP. In addition, treatment may be 
monitored based on the trough serum asparaginase activity measured before the next 
administration of Oncaspar. If asparaginase activity values fail to reach target levels, a switch to a 
different asparaginase preparation could be considered (see section 4.2). Measurement of the 
asparaginase activity level in serum or plasma may be undertaken in order to rule out accelerated 
elimination of asparaginase activity.  Low asparaginase activity levels are often accompanied by 
the appearance of anti-asparaginase antibodies. In such cases, a switch to a different asparaginase 
preparation should be considered. Expert advice should first be sought (see section 4.4). 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Oncaspar may have a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines, by altering the 
ability to react. 
Patients should be advised not to drive or operate machinery if they experience confusion or 
somnolence or other adverse reactions which can impair their ability to drive or operate machinery. 
Overdose 
There have been a few cases of overdose due to accidental mistakes reported with Oncaspar. 
Following overdose, increased liver enzymes, rash and hyperbilirubinaemia have been observed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016 
Page 114/122 
 
 
  
There is no specific pharmacological treatment. In case of overdose, patients must be carefully 
monitored for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriately managed with 
symptomatic and supportive treatment. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing 
have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on available safety data, it is concluded that the safety of pegasparagase does not differ 
dramatically from native asparaginase. Overall, the most common adverse reactions in the 
(>=20%) are hypersensitivity including anaphylactic reaction, febrile neutropenia, anaemia, 
hyperglycaemia platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, blood bilirubin increased. 
The treatment of ALL patients with pegasparagase is considered to be well tolerated and the 
toxicities manageable, as per the recommendations stated in the SmPC and the risk minimisation 
measures in the RMP. Furthermore, additional safety data will be available from the two post-
authorisation efficacy studies (PAES) (see discussion on clinical efficacy) and enable to further 
characterise the safety profile of oncaspar:   
•  Study CAALL-F01, a prospective multicentre cohort study evaluating Oncaspar used in the first-
line treatment of children and adolescents with ALL along with multi-agent chemotherapy. 
•  A multicentre, open label single arm phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and toxicity of 
treatment regimens including Oncaspar in adults (aged 18-60) with newly diagnosed ph negative 
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The applied indication in the treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) covers 
both first line treatment (newly diagnosed patients never treated for their disease, non-
hypersensitive population) and second line treatment (patients with one relapse/treatment failure). 
In the context of a second line treatment, Oncaspar can be given in first intention in patients non-
hypersensitive to native forms of asparaginase or in second intention, i.e. when native 
asparaginase cannot be used due to hypersensitivity. Clinical data were provided to support the 
use of Oncaspar both in hypersensitive patients and non-hypersensitive patients.  
In the main study CCG-1962 to evaluate the use of Oncaspar in first line treatment of ALL (non-
hypersensitive population), 118 paediatric patients aged 1 to 9 years with previously untreated 
standard-risk ALL were randomised to Oncaspar or native E. coli L asparaginase as part of 
combination therapy. The pattern of asparagine depletion was quite similar in all phases of 
treatment, and for both asparaginases The overall 3-year, 5-year and 7-year event-free survival 
(EFS) were 83%, 78% and 75% in the Oncaspar group versus 79%, 73% and 66% in the native E. 
coli asparaginase group. This study was not specifically powered to detect event free survival (EFS) 
and overall survival (OS) differences between treatment groups. However, significant differences in 
efficacy between treatment groups can be excluded. 
Supportive data were provided from a controlled, randomised study comparing Oncaspar to 
another pegylated asparaginase product in combination with multi-agent chemotherapy in the first 
line treatment of newly diagnosed patients from 1 to 30 years of age with high risk B-precursor ALL 
(N=166). At 3-years, the EFS and overall survival (OS) for the Oncaspar treatment arm were 
85.1% [95% CI 72-92%] and 92.4% [95% CI 81-97%], respectively.  
Separate pooled estimates of outcomes and events from a systematic review of all the available 
clinical trials in which only Oncaspar or E. coli L-Asparaginase were used in first-line were also 
provided to support the non-inferiority of Oncaspar compared to native E. coli asparaginase. 
Overall, results from all pooled analyses do not show any significant reduction in the efficacy 
outcomes observed when Oncaspar is used upfront. Immunogenicity data also support the use of 
Oncaspar in first-line. 
With regards to the use of Oncaspar in second-line treatment of ALL patients, study ASP-304 was 
the only comparative study versus native asparaginase of the dossier and is considered the most 
relevant study. Complete remission rates were respectively 41% in hypersensitive patients directly 
assigned to Oncaspar, 39% in non-hypersensitive patients randomised under Oncaspar, and 47% 
in patients randomised in the asparaginase treatment arm. 
Supportive data were provided from five open-label studies (ASP-001, ASP-001C/003C, ASP-201A, 
ASP-302, ASP-400) evaluating Oncaspar in relapse/refractory haematological diseases. Overall, in 
the six studies (ASP-001, ASP-001C/003C, ASP-201A, ASP-302, ASP-400, ASP-304) a total of 94 
patients with ALL diagnosis with a history of prior clinical allergic reaction to native E. coli L-
asparaginase (HS-ALL) were exposed to Oncaspar. One patient received Oncaspar doses of 250 
and 500 Units/m2 intravenously. The remaining patients were treated with 2000 or 2500 U/m2 
administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Patients received Oncaspar as a single agent or in 
combination with multi-agent chemotherapy. Overall, from five studies (ASP-001, ASP-201A, ASP-
302, ASP-304, ASP-400) analysed based on 65 ALL patients exposed to Oncaspar using the highest 
therapeutic response during the entire study, complete remission were observed in 30 patients 
(46%), partial remission in 7 patients (11%) and haematological improvement in 1 patient (2%).

In study ASP-001C/003C among the 29 hypersensitive ALL patients exposed to Oncaspar, 11 
patients were evaluated for response during induction. Of these, 3 patients achieved complete 
remission (27%), 1 patient had partial remission (9%), 1 patient had haematologic improvement 
(9%) and 2 patients had therapeutic efficacy (18%). Therapeutic efficacy was defined as a clinical 
improvement which did not meet the criteria for other beneficial outcomes. During the 
maintenance phase, 19 patients were evaluated, with 17 patients achieving complete remission 
(89%), and 1 patient with therapeutic efficacy, (5%) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
No data are available in high risk ALL Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) patients and a 
warning has been included in the SmPC concerning the uncertain benefit of Oncaspar in such a 
population.  
Some uncertainties were raised with regards to ALL patients non-hypersensitive to native forms of 
asparaginase considering the absence of primary analysis in terms of clinical efficacy or PD to 
support the use of oncaspar in the first line setting (study CCG-1962). Furthermore, results 
obtained in non-hypersensitive patients in the second line setting from study ASP-304 indicate that 
the observed complete remission rates in ALL patients to native asparaginase was lower with 
Oncaspar than with native asparaginase (p=0.625). However, the observed CR difference lacks 
statistical significance, possibly due to the fact that inclusions were stopped before reaching the 
planned sample size.  
Despite the above uncertainties, the results obtained in ALL patients non-hypersensitive to native 
asparaginase in study CCG-1962 in first line treatment were considered clinically relevant. In 
addition, further efficacy and PD data will be available in the subpopulation of patients non-
hypersensitive to native asparaginase from a post-marketing efficacy study (PAES): study CAALL-
F01. This trial will be conducted in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (see Annex II condition).  
Finally, since most of the studies presented were conducted in children, adolescents and young 
adults, there are only limited data available in the adult population. A post-authorisation efficacy 
study (PAES) investigating safety and efficacy when PEG-ASP is used in the first-line treatment 
along with multi-agent chemotherapy in adults with ALL will provide relevant efficacy data in this 
subpopulation (see Annex II conditions). This trial will also allow collecting further data to 
characterise the efficacy of Oncaspar in patients non-hypersensitive to asparaginase. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the most frequent adverse events observed in second-line use studies (except 
immunological events) were hyperbilirubinemia, increased SGPT/SGOT, decreased albumin, 
hyperproteinaemia, fatty liver, hyperamylaseamia, decreased fibrinogen, increased partial 
thromboplastin time, central nervous system thrombosis. Other adverse events (less frequent) 
were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, chills, fever, peripheral neuritis and pain in extremity. 
The most frequently occurring toxicities in the main study (ASP-304) in the second line setting 
were hepatotoxicity and coagulopathy, the majority of which were laboratory abnormalities without 
clinical manifestations. An examination of the expended toxicological data showed a high incidence 
of hypoproteinaemia observed during induction therapy in the treatment groups. There was no 
incidence of bleeding disorders or increased creatinine in any of the treatment groups.  
Thirty-three (83%) of 40 patients directly assigned to Oncaspar had a total of 75 drug related 
adverse experiences with an average duration of 13.5 days. The most common (greater than five 
percent) oncaspar related adverse experiences were increased SGPT (45%), hypoproteinemia

(40%), decreased fibrinogen (30%), increased partial thromboplastin time (15%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (15%), and fever (8%) and allergic reactions.  
Overall, the incidences and types of toxic events in studies in first line setting were very similar 
between PEG-ASNase and native E.coli ASNase arms. Infections were the most toxic events. CNS 
thrombosis occurred in the PEG-ASNase treatment, once during induction and on the second Day 
22 of delayed intensification #1. There was one event of pancreatitis in each arm during induction. 
There were two additional occurrences of pancreatitis in the PEG-ASNase group and during delayed 
intensification #2.  
28 serious adverse drug experiences were reported while the product was in the US market. In 
study CCG-1962, a total of five patients (4.2%) had non-fatal SAEs (3 pegaspargase patients and 2 
native asparaginase patients). Grade 3 or 4 coagulopathy, Grade 3 or 4 pancreatitis, and Grade 4 
neurologic dysfunction; foot pain; Grade 4 CNS toxicity; and Grade 3 or 4 coagulopathy and Grade 
4 neurologic dysfunction were reported. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The submitted safety data were taken from a limited number of well-designed and/or up to date 
studies. Therefore, the safety database is considered limited and no long term safety data was 
available. The safety profile of Oncaspar will be closely monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance as reflected in the RMP. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The endpoints of complete remission after induction and the pharmacodynamics data (asparagine 
blood levels) were considered as acceptable main efficacy endpoints.  
Results of study ASP-304 show that, in ALL hypersensitive patients in second relapse, Oncaspar 
treatment induced a complete remission rate of 41% as part of the induction regimen. These 
results are considered clinically relevant, especially taking into consideration that hypersensitive 
patients cannot be retreated with the native E coli asparaginase. Furthermore, the results obtained 
in ALL patients non-hypersensitive to native asparaginase in study CCG-1962 are considered 
clinically relevant. 
Although the safety can be considered established, albeit based on a limited safety database,  
further measures stated in the RMP will ensure that further safety data will be collected in adults 
and in patients non-hypersensitive to native asparaginase. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Taking into account the efficacy of PEG-asparaginase in terms of serum asparagine depletion and 
complete response rate, and the safety of Oncaspar, the Benefit/Risk balance of Oncaspar is 
considered positive in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients 
from birth to 18 years, and adult patients, as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The initial proposed indication by the applicant included all ALL treatment phases (induction-
consolidation/intensification-maintenance). It was considered debatable that the reported use of 
Oncaspar in the interim-maintenance phases, which are limited in time and interspersed between 
more intensive treatment phases, truly qualified as maintenance treatment. Therefore, the 
indication wording not referring to maintenance phase but more generally to the use of Oncaspar 
as a component of antineoplastic combination therapy is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/826135/2016

There were uncertainties in the use of Oncaspar in patient who are not hypersensitive to native 
asparaginase (i.e. use in first intention) due to the limitations of the data provided in the first line 
and second line setting. In particular, study CCG-1962 was not specifically powered to detect event 
free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) differences between treatment groups. However, the 
observed efficacy results were adequate. 
Results from study CAALL-F01, investigating safety and efficacy of Oncaspar used in the first-line 
treatment along with multi-agent chemotherapy in children with ALL, will allow to further 
characterise the benefit/risk balance of Oncaspar in patients who are not hypersensitive to native 
asparaginase (see Annex II conditions). 
Finally, most of the trials were performed in children, adolescents and young adults. However, 
asparaginase has been shown to have a benefit in ALL adult patients based on literature data and 
clinical experience. Therefore, the CHMP does not recommend a restriction concerning the use of 
Oncaspar according to age. However, additional data are necessary to further define the efficacy, 
safety and immunogenicity of Oncaspar in adults and will be available from a clinical study 
evaluating Oncaspar in adults with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome negative acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (see Annex II conditions).  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Oncaspar is not similar to Atriance (nelarabine), 
Evoltra (clofarabine), Iclusig (ponatinib), Xaluprine (mercaptopurine), Sprycel (dasatinib) and 
Blincyto (blinotumomab) within the meaning of Article 3(3)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/2000. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Oncaspar as a component of antineoplastic combination 
therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in paediatric patients from birth to 18 years, and 
adult patients is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation 
subject to the following conditions:

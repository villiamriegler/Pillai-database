2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application is for marketing authorisation of Arsenic trioxide medac 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion and is based on Directive 2001/83/EC Article 10 (1): a generic application, referring to the reference 
Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion of Teva B.V. which has been authorised in accordance 
with Union provisions in force for not less than 10 years in the EEA. Trisenox 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution 
for infusion was first authorised within the EU on the 05-03-2002 under registration number EU/1/02/204/001. 
The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is not completely understood. Arsenic trioxide causes morphological 
changes and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in NB4 human promyelocytic 
leukaemia cells in vitro. Arsenic trioxide also causes damage or degradation of the fusion protein Pro-Myelocytic 
Leukaemia/Retinoic Acid Receptor-alpha (PML/RAR alpha). 
The reference product Trisenox is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer products 
in  treatment  of  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia  (APL).  The  currently  approved  indication  for  Trisenox  is  as 
follows: 
TRISENOX is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
•  Newly  diagnosed  low-to-intermediate  risk  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia  (APL)  (white  blood  cell 
count, ≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
• Relapsed/refractory APL (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised  by  the  presence  of  the  t(15;17)  translocation  and/or  the  presence  of  the  promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been examined.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 1 mg/ml of arsenic trioxide. 
Other ingredients are sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid (as pH adjusters), and water for injections. 
The product is available in a type I glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper, an aluminium shell 
and a plastic flip-off button as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of arsenic trioxide is Arsenic (III) oxide corresponding to the molecular formula As2O3. It has 
a relative molecular mass of 197.84 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by a combination of crystallography (XRD) for 
characterization of the cubic crystal form, thermogravimetric analysis, hygroscopy, and IR spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to off white crystalline powder, practically insoluble to sparingly 
soluble in water. It dissolves in solutions of alkali hydroxides (1M NaOH) but is less soluble in acids. It is 
practically insoluble in ethanol, chloroform and ethyl ether.  
Arsenic trioxide has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed. The cubic crystal form 
is used. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the 
ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is synthesized in 3 main steps using commercially available well-defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The specifications and control methods for starting materials and reagents have 
been presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/411838/2020 
Page 8/18 
 
  
  
 
 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in white opaque high-density polyethylene bottles with blue polypropylene 
closure containing a lid of polyethylene foam which complies with the Ph. Eur. Monographs, and the EC 10/2011 
as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification from the finished product manufacturer includes tests for appearance 
(visual), identification (Ph. Eur.), appearance of the solution (Ph. Eur.), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(potentiometric titration), heavy metals (ICP-OES), iron (ICP-OES), As(0) content (ion chromatography), As2O5 
content (ion chromatography), water content (coulometry), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.), and endotoxins 
(Ph. Eur.).   
The validation data of the ICP-OES method to test metallic arsenic is currently not available, due to social 
distancing practice in the lab as a result of COVID-19 and the method validation and report cannot be completed 
by the time of the opinion. However, an appropriate method description for the ICP-OES analytical method for 
determination of metallic arsenic (As0) is provided. The CHMP recommended to provide the validation data of 
the ICP-OES method to test metallic arsenic together with the next variation. Impurities are not present at 
higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A. Appropriate specifications have been set.  
The controls that are currently associated with the active substance process ensure that the levels of potential 
elemental impurities are maintained below their respective PDEs as established for the parenteral route of 
administration in the finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described or referenced, where relevant, and 
non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) for the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long-term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 
75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided.  
The tests and analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
All results comply with the specification. The long-term data and accelerated data show no changes over time 
and only little variability. Based on this data, an extrapolation of the retest period beyond the period covered by 
long term data is proposed according to ICH Q1E “Note for guidance on evaluation of stability data” and it is 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/411838/2020 
Page 9/18 
 
  
  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months if it is preserved in tight containers 
protected from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Arsenic trioxide concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear and colourless solution. Each 10 mL contains 10 
mg arsenic trioxide as the active substance. It is a sterile solution for single use and contains no antimicrobial 
preservative. The pH of arsenic trioxide concentrate is between 6.0-8.0. Arsenic trioxide concentrate is diluted 
before use.  
The finished product has been developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product Trisenox 
1 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion. Consequently, the objective was to prepare a parenteral 
formulation being essentially similar to the reference medicinal product. 
The active substance is sparingly soluble in cold water and dissolves readily in alkaline solutions to give 
arsenites. Arsenic trioxide is compatible with the excipients sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, nitrogen gas 
and water for injections. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The commercial formulation of Trisenox utilises 1.2 mg/mL of sodium hydroxide for solubilisation and 
hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment. Given the stated use of sodium hydroxide in the formulation, the 
formulations of the reference and generic medicinal product are equivalent in this respect. The reference 
medicinal product is adjusted to a pH range of 7.0 to 9.0. These minor differences in formulation between the 
reference and the generic medicinal product would have no effect on the bioequivalence of the two intravenous 
injections. 
The finished product is manufactured for the market as an aqueous, sterile injection intended for single use only. 
The general manufacturing methodology for producing aqueous, sterile injectable involves blending, filling the 
solution into vials, sealing of the vials, terminal steam sterilization, visual inspection and labelling and 
packaging. The manufacturing process was developed using Good Manufacturing Practice and In House 
Standard Operating Procedures to produce a sterile solution in a glass, rubber capped vial. The manufacturing 
process has been validated. Autoclave studies were carried out and the formulation was found to be stable when 
steam sterilised. The sterilisation method complies with the British Pharmacopeia (BP) sterility methods. 
The primary packaging is comprised of a type I glass vial, chlorobutyl rubber stopper and seal. The materials 
comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. To ensure compatibility of the stopper with the 
product, an extractables and leachables study as well as container integrity was conducted. No concerns were 
identified.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: dissolution of the active substance and pH adjustment, 
filtration, filling the solution into vials, sealing of the vials, terminal steam sterilization, visual inspection and 
labelling and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturer of the finished product has a large portfolio of sterile injectable drugs that have been 
manufactured by the company for over two decades. The experience and the know-how gained have been used 
during the development of manufacturing process for this product. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated in three consecutive production scale batches by 
a  number  of  studies.  It has  been demonstrated that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type 
of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance  (visual),  visible  particles  (Ph.  Eur.),  identification  (Ph.  Eur.),  pH  of  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  related 
substances (HPLC), assay (titration), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.).   
The in-use specification for the finished product after dilution include appropriate tests: appearance (visual), 
clarity of solution (visual), visible particles (Ph. Eur.), pH of the solution (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), 
sub-visible particles (Ph. Eur.) and assay (HPLC). 
There is no Ph. Eur. monograph for arsenic trioxide injection on which to base the specifications for arsenic 
trioxide concentrate. There is a monograph Arsenii trioxidum ad praeparationes homoeopathicas in Ph. Eur. on 
which the raw material specification is partially based. Arsenic trioxide 1mg/ml concentrate complies with the 
requirements stated under the general Ph. Eur. monograph for parenteral preparations. 
Potential impurities and degradation products are controlled during the synthesis of the active substance. For 
the major impurity the finished product specification provides a limit and limits for unidentified impurities and 
total impurities are also provided. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data were provided for 4 
batches. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary 
to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is considered satisfactory. 
The risk assessment into the presence of nitrosamines has shown that there is no significant risk of 
N-nitrosamine impurities being present within the finished product. As such, a test for these impurities is not 
required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term 
conditions (30ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are representative to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were stored upside-down, so that product is 
in contact with stoppers and leakages can be detected. 
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, pH, related substances, extractable volume, sub-visible particles, 
bacterial endotoxins and sterility. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Under long term and accelerated stability conditions, the results were all within the proposed specification. No 
trends were noted. 
Stability data for the next three batches indicate there is no change to the stability of product due to the change 
in batch size. Results for vials stored under accelerated conditions for 6 months indicate the product is stable. 
Available results for vials stored at 30°C (1 batch for 18 months and two for 24 months) indicate the product will 
continue to be stable up to 36 months when stored below 30°C 
In addition, 2 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. Two storage conditions were used – dark control and exposed to light test. The 
differences  in  results  between  the  dark  control  samples  and  the  exposed  test  samples  were  within  the 
acceptance  limits.  Thus,  it  is  confirmed  that  the  finished  product  is  not  light  sensitive  when  stored  in  the 
container packaging. 
A compatibility study which also addressed in-use stability has been completed. Two batches were diluted in 
both 100 mL and 250 mL of 5% glucose, and also in 100mL and 250mL of 0.9% NaCl. The diluted solutions were 
stored at 2-8°C and at 30°C and tested up to 72 hours. All test results were within specification. Thus, it is 
confirmed that the finished product when diluted in 100 mL or 250 mL of glucose or saline intravenous solution 
is chemically stable for up to 72 hours when stored at 2-8°C or 30°C. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
After dilution in intravenous solutions, the finished product is chemically and physically stable for 24 hours at 
15°C-30°C and 48 hours when refrigerated (2°C-8°C). From a microbiological point of view, the product must 
be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C-8°C, unless dilution has taken 
place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To provide the validation data of the ICP-OES method to test metallic arsenic in the active substance together 
with the next variation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant performed the Phase I of the ERA according to the ERA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 
2). The calculated PECsurfacewater is below the threshold value of 0.01 µg/L stated in the ERA guideline, therefore 
a Phase II assessment is not required. As PBT and vPvB criteria do not apply to inorganic substances, log Kow 
determination for Arsenic trioxide medac is not required, either. Considering the above-presented data, Arsenic

2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview provides a sufficient outline on the available literature concerning the non-clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of arsenic trioxide which is considered adequate. 
Cross-references to the scientific literature proposed by the Applicant have been included in each part of the 
Non-Clinical Overview, as requested by the CHMP.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Arsenic trioxide medac is a generic of the reference product Trisenox. The 
literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-clinical 
aspects of Arsenic trioxide medac in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of arsenic trioxide based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) is 
relevant.  
Exemption  
This is a generic application for a medicinal product supplied as a concentrate for solution for infusion in glass 
vials  for  single  use.  According  to  the  Appendix  II  of  the  Guideline  on  the  investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/Corr**):  “Bioequivalence  studies  are  generally  not  required  if  the  test 
product is to be administered as aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the 
currently approved product”. No bioequivalence study was conducted, and none is required, since the product is 
to  be  administered  as  an  aqueous  solution  for  injection  for  intravenous  administration  containing  the  same 
active substance in the same concentrations, the same pharmaceutical form and route of administration as the 
currently  authorised  reference  medicinal  product.  In  addition,  Arsenic  trioxide  medac  contains  the  same 
excipients  as  the  reference  medicinal  product  and  the  excipients  are  not  known  to  interact  with  the  drug 
substance or to otherwise affect the disposition of the drug substance. 
Therefore, for the current generic application, the essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is 
only based on pharmaceutical equivalence, which is accepted by the CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The product is to be administered as an intravenous infusion containing the same active substance and the same 
excipients as the reference product. For this type of product, no bioequivalence studies are required according 
to the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence.  
The essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is based only on pharmaceutical equivalence. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics  
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application and this is acceptable as being in accordance 
with the Appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **). 
Arsenic trioxide medac is considered essentially similar to Trisenox Teva B.V. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Arsenic trioxide medac and justifications that the 
active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference 
product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Arsenic trioxide medac 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The indication of the reference product Trisenox is as follows:  
TRISENOX is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
• Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, ≤10 x 
103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
• Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (previous treatment should have included a retinoid 
and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been examined.  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well 
as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Arsenic trioxide medac is favourable in the following indication: 
“Arsenic trioxide medac is indicated for induction of remission, and consolidation in adult patients with: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/411838/2020 
Page 17/18 
 
  
  
 
 
•  Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) (white blood cell count, 
≤10 x 103/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) 
•  Relapsed/refractory APL (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and chemotherapy) 
characterised by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic 
leukaemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene. 
The response rate of other acute myelogenous leukaemia subtypes to arsenic trioxide has not been examined”.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

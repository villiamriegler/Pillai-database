1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Emgality 120 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each pre-filled pen contains 120 mg of galcanezumab in 1 mL. 
Galcanezumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
cells. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.  
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection (injection). 
The solution is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Emgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per 
month. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 120 mg galcanezumab injected subcutaneously once monthly, with a 
240 mg loading dose as the initial dose. 
Patients should be instructed to inject a missed dose as soon as possible and then resume monthly 
dosing. 
The treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further 
decision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to 
continue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
There is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years. No dose adjustment is required as the 
pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab are not affected by age.   
Renal impairment/hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of galcanezumab in children aged 6 to 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available.

There is no relevant use of galcanezumab in children below the age of 6 years for the prevention of 
migraine.  
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous use. 
A patient may self-inject galcanezumab by following the Instructions for Use. Galcanezumab is to be 
injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, back of the upper arm, or in the gluteal region. After 
training, patients may self-inject galcanezumab if a healthcare professional determines that it is 
appropriate. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the Package Leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Cardiovascular risk 
Patients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see 
section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. 
Serious hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and urticaria have been 
reported (see section 4.8). Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur within 1 day after 
galcanezumab administration, however cases with a delayed onset (ranging from more than 1 day to 
4 weeks after administration) have been reported. In some cases, hypersensitivity reactions had a 
prolonged duration. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of galcanezumab 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated (see section 4.3). Patients should 
be informed on the possibility of a delayed onset hypersensitivity reaction and instructed to contact 
their physician.  
Excipients  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No drug interaction studies were conducted. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected based 
on the characteristics of galcanezumab.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of galcanezumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Human immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it 
is preferable to avoid the use of galcanezumab during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether galcanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. 
Afterwards, use of galcanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed.  
Fertility 
The effect of galcanezumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Fertility studies in animals do 
not indicate harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Galcanezumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo may 
occur following the administration of galcanezumab (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Over  2 500 patients  were  exposed  to  galcanezumab  in  migraine  prophylaxis  studies  supporting  the 
initial  registration  of  galcanezumab.  Over  1 400 patients  were  exposed  to  galcanezumab  during  the 
double-blind treatment phase of the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies. 279  patients were exposed for 
12 months. 
The reported adverse drug reactions for 120 mg and 240 mg in the migraine clinical trials were injection 
site pain (10.1 %/11.6 %),  injection site reactions (9.9 %/14.5 %), vertigo (0.7 %/1.2 %), constipation 
(1.0 %/1.5 %), pruritus (0.7 %/1.2 %) and urticaria (0.3 %/0.1 %). Most of the reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity. Less than 2.5 % of patients in these studies discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site pain or reactions  
The majority of reactions related to the injection site were mild to moderate and less than 0.5 % of 
patients exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies discontinued the treatment due to an 
injection site reaction. The majority of injection site reactions were reported within 1 day and on 
average resolved within 5 days. In 86 % of the patients reporting injection site pain, the reaction 
occurred within 1 hour of injection and resolved on average in 1 day. One percent of the patients 
exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies experienced severe pain at the injection site. 
Urticaria 
While urticaria is uncommon, serious cases of urticaria have been reported in galcanezumab clinical 
studies. 
Immunogenicity 
In the clinical studies, the incidence of anti-drug antibody development during the double-blind 
treatment phase was 4.8 % in patients receiving galcanezumab once monthly (all but one of whom had 
in vitro neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment, up to 12.5 % of galcanezumab-treated 
patients developed anti-drug antibodies, most of which were of low titre and tested positive for 
neutralising activity in vitro. However, the presence of anti-drug antibodies did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of galcanezumab. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose  
Doses up to 600 mg have been administered subcutaneously to humans without dose-limiting toxicity. 
In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC 
code: N02CD02 
Mechanism of action 
Galcanezumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) thus preventing its biological activity. Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been 
associated with migraine attacks. Galcanezumab binds to CGRP with high affinity (KD = 31 pM) and 
high specificity (> 10 000-fold vs related peptides adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin and intermedin).  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of galcanezumab has been studied in 3 phase 3, randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind studies in adult patients (N = 2 886). The 2 episodic migraine studies 
(EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) enrolled patients who met International Classification of Headache 
Disorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura with 4-14 migraine 
headache days per month. The chronic migraine study (REGAIN) enrolled patients who met ICHD 
criteria for chronic migraine with ≥ 15 headache days per month, of which at least 8 had the features 
of migraine. Patients with recent acute cardiovascular events (including MI, unstable angina, CABG, 
stroke, DVT) and/or those deemed to be at serious cardiovascular risk were excluded from the 
galcanezumab clinical trials. Patients > 65 years of age were also excluded. 
Patients received placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the 
first month) or galcanezumab 240 mg/month and were allowed to use medication for the acute 
treatment of migraine. Across the 3 studies, patients were predominantly female (> 83 %) with a mean 
age of 41 years, and an average migraine history of 20 to 21 years. Approximately one-third of 
patients across the studies had at least 1 prior failure on a migraine prophylactic treatment for efficacy 
reasons and approximately 16 % of patients across the studies had at least 2 prior failure on a 
prophylactic treatment for efficacy reasons. 
In all 3 studies, the overall mean change from baseline in number of monthly Migraine Headache 
Days (MHDs) was the primary efficacy measure. Response rate is the mean percentage of patients 
meeting a defined threshold in the reduction of the number of monthly MHDs (≥ 50 %, ≥ 75 % and 
100 %) across the double-blind treatment period. The impact of migraine on functioning was assessed 
by the Role Function-Restrictive domain of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(MSQ) version 2.1, and by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire. The MSQ 
measures impact of migraine on work or daily activities, relationships with family and friends, leisure 
time, productivity, concentration, energy, and tiredness. Scoring ranges from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating less impairment , that is, patients experience fewer restrictions on the performance of 
day-to-day activities. For the MIDAS, higher scores indicate more disability. The baseline scores of 
the MIDAS reflected severe migraine related disability of patients in EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 
(mean of 33.1) and a very severely disabled population (mean of 67.2) in REGAIN.

Episodic migraine 
Studies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 had a 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment 
period. Completion rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab 
ranged from 82.8 % to 87.7 %.  
Both galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see 
Table 2). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the 
number of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. 
Galcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ 
Role Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at 
month 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of 
improvement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) 
compared with those treated with placebo. Galcanezumab was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction in disability over placebo. 
Compared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had 
significantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at month 1 and at 
all subsequent months up to month 6 (see Figure 1). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated with 
galcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs compared 
with placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.

In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2, in patients who failed one or more 
prophylactic treatments for efficacy reasons, the treatment difference for the reduction of mean 
monthly MHDs observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo was -2.69 days (p < 0.001) and 
between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo -2.78 days (p < 0.001). In patients failing two or more 
prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference was -2.64 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and 
placebo and -3.04 days (p < 0.001) between 240 mg and placebo.  
Chronic migraine 
Study REGAIN had a 3 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a 
9 month open-label extension. Approximately 15 % of the patients continued concurrent treatment 
with topiramate or propranolol as allowed by the protocol for prophylaxis of migraine. Completion 
rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab was 95.3 %.  
Both galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see 
Table 3). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the 
number of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. 
Galcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ 
Role Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at 
month 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of 
improvement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) 
compared with those treated with placebo. The 120 mg dose was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction in disability over placebo.  
Compared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had 
significantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at the first month 
and at all subsequent months up to month 3 (see Figure 2). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated 
with galcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs 
compared with placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.

placebo was -3.54 days (p < 0.001) and between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo -1.37 days 
(p < 0.05). In patients failing two or more prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference 
was -4.48 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and placebo and -1.86 days (p < 0.01) between 240 mg 
and placebo. 
Sixty-four percent of the patients had acute headache medication overuse at baseline. In these patients, 
the treatment difference observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo and between 
galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo for the reduction of MHDs in these patients was 
respectively -2.53 days (p < 0.001) and -2.26 days (p < 0.001).  
Long term efficacy 
Efficacy was sustained for up to 1 year in an open-label study in which patients with either episodic or 
chronic migraine (with an average baseline of 10.6 monthly MHDs) received galcanezumab 
120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the first month) or galcanezumab 
240 mg/month. 77.8 % of patients completed the treatment period. The overall mean reduction from 
baseline in the number of monthly MHDs averaged over the treatment phase was 5.6 days for the 
120 mg dose group and 6.5 days for the 240 mg dose group. Over 72 % of patients completing the 
study reported a 50 % reduction in MHDs at month 12. In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and 
EVOLVE-2, more than 19 % of the patients treated with galcanezumab maintained a ≥ 50 % response 
from Month 1 to Month 6 versus 8 % of the patients on placebo (p < 0.001). 
Phase 3 study in a population with previous failure to 2 to 4 migraine preventive medication 
categories  
Study CONQUER, in episodic and chronic migraine patients that experienced previous failures to 2 to 
4 prophylactic medication categories in the past 10 years, supports the main findings of the previous 
migraine efficacy studies, i.e. galcanezumab treatment led to a mean reduction in monthly migraine 
headache days (4.1 days compared to 1.0 days in the placebo group; p<.0001).  Mean reduction in 
monthly migraine headache days was also observed within the subpopulations of episodic migraine 
(2.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 0.3 days for placebo; p<.0001) and chronic migraine 
(5.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 2.2 days for placebo; p<.0001). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
galcanezumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis of migraine 
headaches (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following a loading dose of 240 mg the 
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of galcanezumab was approximately 30 μg/mL 
(27 % coefficient of variation, (CV)) and the time to Cmax was 5 days postdose.  
Monthly doses of 120 mg or 240 mg achieved a steady-state Cmax (Cmax, ss) of approximately 28 μg/mL 
(35 % CV) or 54 μg/mL (31 % CV), respectively. The galcanezumab Cmax, ss at monthly doses of 
120 mg is achieved after the 240 mg loading dose. 
Injection site location (abdomen, thigh, buttocks and arm) did not significantly influence the 
absorption of galcanezumab. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of galcanezumab was 7.3 L. 
Biotransformation 
As a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody, galcanezumab is expected to be degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
Elimination 
Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance of galcanezumab was approximately 
0.008 L/hour and the half life of galcanezumab was 27 days.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Galcanezumab exposure increases proportionally with dose. 
Based on a population PK analysis that included doses ranging from 5 – 300 mg, the rate of 
absorption, apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution was independent of dose. 
Age, sex, weight, race, ethnicity 
No dose adjustment is needed on the basis of age (18 to 65 years), sex, weight, race or ethnicity as 
there was no clinically meaningful effect of these factors on the apparent clearance or apparent volume 
of distribution of galcanezumab.  
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of galcanezumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of IgG 
monoclonal antibody is low. Similarly, IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via 
intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence the clearance of 
galcanezumab. Based on a population PK analysis, bilirubin concentration or Cockcroft-Gault 
creatinine clearance (range: 24 to 308 mL/min) did not significantly influence the apparent clearance 
of galcanezumab. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazards for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies 
conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and safety pharmacology evaluations conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys at exposures approximately 10 to 80 times higher than clinical exposures in 
patients receiving 240 mg. 
Nonclinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of 
galcanezumab. There is no evidence to suggest that chronic treatment with galcanezumab would 
increase the risk of carcinogenesis based on data from pharmacology and chronic toxicology studies 
with galcanezumab, as well as an assessment of the literature regarding CGRP.  
No effects on fertility parameters such as oestrous cycle, sperm analysis, or mating and reproductive 
performance were observed in rats that were administered galcanezumab (exposures approximately 4 
to 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg). In male fertility study, right testis weight was 
significantly reduced at exposures to 4 times the human exposure at 240 mg. 
At Gestational Day 20, an increase in the number of foetuses and litters with short ribs and a decrease 
in the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae occurred in the rat embryo-foetal toxicity 
development study at an exposure approximately 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg. These 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
findings were noted at no maternal toxicity and were considered to be related to galcanezumab but 
non-adverse.  
At Gestational Day 29, in rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study skull anomaly was found in 
one male foetus from mother treated with galcanezumab at an exposure approximately 33 times the 
human exposure at 240 mg. 
In a juvenile toxicology study in which rats were administered galcanezumab twice weekly from 
Postnatal Day 21 through 90, systemic effects were limited to reversible, minimal, nonadverse 
decreases in total bone mineral content and bone mineral density at exposures approximately 50 times 
the human exposure at 240 mg.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Emgality is indicated for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per 
month. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration  
Treatment should be initiated by physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of migraine. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 120 mg galcanezumab injected subcutaneously once monthly, with a 
240 mg loading dose as the initial dose. 
Patients should be instructed to inject a missed dose as soon as possible and then resume monthly 
dosing. 
The treatment benefit should be assessed within 3 months after initiation of treatment. Any further 
decision to continue treatment should be taken on an individual patient basis. Evaluation of the need to 
continue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
There is limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years. No dose adjustment is required as the 
pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab are not affected by age.   
Renal impairment/hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment (see section 5.2).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of galcanezumab in children aged 6 to 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no relevant use of galcanezumab in children below the age of 6 years for the prevention of 
migraine.  
Method of administration  
Subcutaneous use. 
A patient may self-inject galcanezumab by following the Instructions for Use. Galcanezumab is to be 
injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh, back of the upper arm, or in the gluteal region. After 
training, patients may self-inject galcanezumab if a healthcare professional determines that it is 
appropriate. Comprehensive instructions for administration are given in the Package Leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Cardiovascular risk 
Patients with certain major cardiovascular diseases were excluded from clinical studies (see 
section 5.1). No safety data are available in these patients. 
Serious hypersensitivity 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including cases of anaphylaxis, angioedema and urticaria have been 
reported (see section 4.8). Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur within 1 day after 
galcanezumab administration, however cases with a delayed onset (ranging from more than 1 day to 
4 weeks after administration) have been reported. In some cases, hypersensitivity reactions had a 
prolonged duration. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of galcanezumab 
should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated (see section 4.3). Patients should 
be informed on the possibility of a delayed onset hypersensitivity reaction and instructed to contact 
their physician.  
Excipients  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 120 mg dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction  
No drug interaction studies were conducted. No pharmacokinetic drug interactions are expected based 
on the characteristics of galcanezumab.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of galcanezumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Human immunoglobulin (IgG) is known to cross the placental barrier. As a precautionary measure, it 
is preferable to avoid the use of galcanezumab during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether galcanezumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG is known to be excreted 
in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. 
Afterwards, use of galcanezumab could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed.  
Fertility 
The effect of galcanezumab on human fertility has not been evaluated. Fertility studies in animals do 
not indicate harmful effects with respect to male and female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Galcanezumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Vertigo may 
occur following the administration of galcanezumab (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Over  2 500 patients  were  exposed  to  galcanezumab  in  migraine  prophylaxis  studies  supporting  the 
initial  registration  of  galcanezumab.  Over  1 400 patients  were  exposed  to  galcanezumab  during  the 
double-blind treatment phase of the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies. 279  patients were exposed for 
12 months. 
The reported adverse drug reactions for 120 mg and 240 mg in the migraine clinical trials were injection 
site pain (10.1 %/11.6 %),  injection site reactions (9.9 %/14.5 %), vertigo (0.7 %/1.2 %), constipation 
(1.0 %/1.5 %), pruritus (0.7 %/1.2 %) and urticaria (0.3 %/0.1 %). Most of the reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity. Less than 2.5 % of patients in these studies discontinued due to adverse reactions.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site pain or reactions  
The majority of reactions related to the injection site were mild to moderate and less than 0.5 % of 
patients exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies discontinued the treatment due to an 
injection site reaction. The majority of injection site reactions were reported within 1 day and on 
average resolved within 5 days. In 86 % of the patients reporting injection site pain, the reaction 
occurred within 1 hour of injection and resolved on average in 1 day. One percent of the patients 
exposed to galcanezumab during the phase 3 studies experienced severe pain at the injection site. 
Urticaria 
While urticaria is uncommon, serious cases of urticaria have been reported in galcanezumab clinical 
studies. 
Immunogenicity 
In the clinical studies, the incidence of anti-drug antibody development during the double-blind 
treatment phase was 4.8 % in patients receiving galcanezumab once monthly (all but one of whom had 
in vitro neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment, up to 12.5 % of galcanezumab-treated 
patients developed anti-drug antibodies, most of which were of low titre and tested positive for 
neutralising activity in vitro. However, the presence of anti-drug antibodies did not affect the 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety of galcanezumab. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose  
Doses up to 600 mg have been administered subcutaneously to humans without dose-limiting toxicity. 
In case of an overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: analgesics, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, ATC 
code: N02CD02 
Mechanism of action 
Galcanezumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds calcitonin gene-related peptide 
(CGRP) thus preventing its biological activity. Elevated blood concentrations of CGRP have been 
associated with migraine attacks. Galcanezumab binds to CGRP with high affinity (KD = 31 pM) and 
high specificity (> 10 000-fold vs related peptides adrenomedullin, amylin, calcitonin and intermedin).  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of galcanezumab has been studied in 3 phase 3, randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blind studies in adult patients (N = 2 886). The 2 episodic migraine studies 
(EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2) enrolled patients who met International Classification of Headache 
Disorders (ICHD) criteria for a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura with 4-14 migraine 
headache days per month. The chronic migraine study (REGAIN) enrolled patients who met ICHD 
criteria for chronic migraine with ≥ 15 headache days per month, of which at least 8 had the features 
of migraine. Patients with recent acute cardiovascular events (including MI, unstable angina, CABG, 
stroke, DVT) and/or those deemed to be at serious cardiovascular risk were excluded from the 
galcanezumab clinical trials. Patients > 65 years of age were also excluded. 
Patients received placebo, galcanezumab 120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the 
first month) or galcanezumab 240 mg/month and were allowed to use medication for the acute 
treatment of migraine. Across the 3 studies, patients were predominantly female (> 83 %) with a mean 
age of 41 years, and an average migraine history of 20 to 21 years. Approximately one-third of 
patients across the studies had at least 1 prior failure on a migraine prophylactic treatment for efficacy 
reasons and approximately 16 % of patients across the studies had at least 2 prior failure on a 
prophylactic treatment for efficacy reasons. 
In all 3 studies, the overall mean change from baseline in number of monthly Migraine Headache 
Days (MHDs) was the primary efficacy measure. Response rate is the mean percentage of patients 
meeting a defined threshold in the reduction of the number of monthly MHDs (≥ 50 %, ≥ 75 % and 
100 %) across the double-blind treatment period. The impact of migraine on functioning was assessed 
by the Role Function-Restrictive domain of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(MSQ) version 2.1, and by the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) Questionnaire. The MSQ 
measures impact of migraine on work or daily activities, relationships with family and friends, leisure 
time, productivity, concentration, energy, and tiredness. Scoring ranges from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating less impairment , that is, patients experience fewer restrictions on the performance of 
day-to-day activities. For the MIDAS, higher scores indicate more disability. The baseline scores of 
the MIDAS reflected severe migraine related disability of patients in EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 
(mean of 33.1) and a very severely disabled population (mean of 67.2) in REGAIN.   
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Episodic migraine 
Studies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2 had a 6 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment 
period. Completion rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab 
ranged from 82.8 % to 87.7 %.  
Both galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see 
Table 2). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the 
number of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. 
Galcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ 
Role Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at 
month 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of 
improvement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) 
compared with those treated with placebo. Galcanezumab was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction in disability over placebo. 
Compared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had 
significantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at month 1 and at 
all subsequent months up to month 6 (see Figure 1). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated with 
galcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs compared 
with placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.

In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2, in patients who failed one or more 
prophylactic treatments for efficacy reasons, the treatment difference for the reduction of mean 
monthly MHDs observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo was -2.69 days (p < 0.001) and 
between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo -2.78 days (p < 0.001). In patients failing two or more 
prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference was -2.64 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and 
placebo and -3.04 days (p < 0.001) between 240 mg and placebo.  
Chronic migraine 
Study REGAIN had a 3 month, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment period followed by a 
9 month open-label extension. Approximately 15 % of the patients continued concurrent treatment 
with topiramate or propranolol as allowed by the protocol for prophylaxis of migraine. Completion 
rate of the double-blind treatment phase for patients who received galcanezumab was 95.3 %.  
Both galcanezumab 120 mg and 240 mg treatment groups demonstrated statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful improvements from baseline compared to placebo on mean change in MHD (see 
Table 3). Patients treated with galcanezumab had greater response rates and greater reductions in the 
number of monthly MHDs that acute medication was taken compared with placebo-treated patients. 
Galcanezumab-treated patients had a greater improvement in functioning (as measured by the MSQ 
Role Function-Restrictive domain score) compared with placebo-treated patients, beginning at 
month 1. More patients treated with galcanezumab achieved clinically significant levels of 
improvement in functioning (responder rate based on MSQ Role Function Restrictive domain) 
compared with those treated with placebo. The 120 mg dose was associated with a statistically 
significant reduction in disability over placebo.  
Compared with placebo-treated patients, patients treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg had 
significantly greater mean decreases from baseline in the number of monthly MHDs at the first month 
and at all subsequent months up to month 3 (see Figure 2). Additionally, in month 1, patients treated 
with galcanezumab (loading dose of 240 mg) demonstrated significantly fewer weekly MHDs 
compared with placebo-treated patients, at week 1 and each subsequent week.

In patients who failed one or more prophylactic treatments for efficacy reasons, the treatment 
difference for the reduction of mean monthly MHDs observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and 
placebo was -3.54 days (p < 0.001) and between galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo -1.37 days 
(p < 0.05). In patients failing two or more prophylactic treatments, the treatment difference 
was -4.48 days (p < 0.001) between 120 mg and placebo and -1.86 days (p < 0.01) between 240 mg 
and placebo. 
Sixty-four percent of the patients had acute headache medication overuse at baseline. In these patients, 
the treatment difference observed between galcanezumab 120 mg and placebo and between 
galcanezumab 240 mg and placebo for the reduction of MHDs in these patients was 
respectively -2.53 days (p < 0.001) and -2.26 days (p < 0.001).  
Long term efficacy 
Efficacy was sustained for up to 1 year in an open-label study in which patients with either episodic or 
chronic migraine (with an average baseline of 10.6 monthly MHDs) received galcanezumab 
120 mg/month (with an initial loading dose of 240 mg for the first month) or galcanezumab 
240 mg/month. 77.8 % of patients completed the treatment period. The overall mean reduction from 
baseline in the number of monthly MHDs averaged over the treatment phase was 5.6 days for the 
120 mg dose group and 6.5 days for the 240 mg dose group. Over 72 % of patients completing the 
study reported a 50 % reduction in MHDs at month 12. In pooled data from studies EVOLVE-1 and 
EVOLVE-2, more than 19 % of the patients treated with galcanezumab maintained a ≥ 50 % response 
from Month 1 to Month 6 versus 8 % of the patients on placebo (p < 0.001). 
Phase 3 study in a population with previous failure to 2 to 4 migraine preventive medication 
categories  
Study CONQUER, in episodic and chronic migraine patients that experienced previous failures to 2 to 
4 prophylactic medication categories in the past 10 years, supports the main findings of the previous 
migraine efficacy studies, i.e. galcanezumab treatment led to a mean reduction in monthly migraine 
headache days (4.1 days compared to 1.0 days in the placebo group; p<.0001).  Mean reduction in 
monthly migraine headache days was also observed within the subpopulations of episodic migraine 
(2.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 0.3 days for placebo; p<.0001) and chronic migraine 
(5.9 days for galcanezumab compared with 2.2 days for placebo; p<.0001). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
galcanezumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the prophylaxis of migraine 
headaches (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
Absorption 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, following a loading dose of 240 mg the 
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of galcanezumab was approximately 30 μg/mL 
(27 % coefficient of variation, (CV)) and the time to Cmax was 5 days postdose.  
Monthly doses of 120 mg or 240 mg achieved a steady-state Cmax (Cmax, ss) of approximately 28 μg/mL 
(35 % CV) or 54 μg/mL (31 % CV), respectively. The galcanezumab Cmax, ss at monthly doses of 
120 mg is achieved after the 240 mg loading dose. 
Injection site location (abdomen, thigh, buttocks and arm) did not significantly influence the 
absorption of galcanezumab. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent volume of distribution of galcanezumab was 7.3 L. 
Biotransformation 
As a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody, galcanezumab is expected to be degraded into small 
peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG. 
Elimination 
Based on a population PK analysis, the apparent clearance of galcanezumab was approximately 
0.008 L/hour and the half life of galcanezumab was 27 days.  
Linearity/non-linearity 
Galcanezumab exposure increases proportionally with dose. 
Based on a population PK analysis that included doses ranging from 5 – 300 mg, the rate of 
absorption, apparent clearance and apparent volume of distribution was independent of dose. 
Age, sex, weight, race, ethnicity 
No dose adjustment is needed on the basis of age (18 to 65 years), sex, weight, race or ethnicity as 
there was no clinically meaningful effect of these factors on the apparent clearance or apparent volume 
of distribution of galcanezumab.  
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of galcanezumab have not been conducted. Renal elimination of IgG 
monoclonal antibody is low. Similarly, IgG monoclonal antibodies are mainly eliminated via 
intracellular catabolism and hepatic impairment is not expected to influence the clearance of 
galcanezumab. Based on a population PK analysis, bilirubin concentration or Cockcroft-Gault 
creatinine clearance (range: 24 to 308 mL/min) did not significantly influence the apparent clearance 
of galcanezumab. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
Non-clinical data revealed no special hazards for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies 
conducted in rats and cynomolgus monkeys and safety pharmacology evaluations conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys at exposures approximately 10 to 80 times higher than clinical exposures in 
patients receiving 240 mg. 
Nonclinical studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of 
galcanezumab. There is no evidence to suggest that chronic treatment with galcanezumab would 
increase the risk of carcinogenesis based on data from pharmacology and chronic toxicology studies 
with galcanezumab, as well as an assessment of the literature regarding CGRP.  
No effects on fertility parameters such as oestrous cycle, sperm analysis, or mating and reproductive 
performance were observed in rats that were administered galcanezumab (exposures approximately 4 
to 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg). In male fertility study, right testis weight was 
significantly reduced at exposures to 4 times the human exposure at 240 mg. 
At Gestational Day 20, an increase in the number of foetuses and litters with short ribs and a decrease 
in the mean number of ossified caudal vertebrae occurred in the rat embryo-foetal toxicity 
development study at an exposure approximately 20 times the human exposure at 240 mg. These 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
findings were noted at no maternal toxicity and were considered to be related to galcanezumab but 
non-adverse.  
At Gestational Day 29, in rabbit embryo-foetal development toxicity study skull anomaly was found in 
one male foetus from mother treated with galcanezumab at an exposure approximately 33 times the 
human exposure at 240 mg. 
In a juvenile toxicology study in which rats were administered galcanezumab twice weekly from 
Postnatal Day 21 through 90, systemic effects were limited to reversible, minimal, nonadverse 
decreases in total bone mineral content and bone mineral density at exposures approximately 50 times 
the human exposure at 240 mg.

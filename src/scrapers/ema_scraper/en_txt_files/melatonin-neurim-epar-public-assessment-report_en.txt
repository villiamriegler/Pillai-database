2.  Scientific discussion 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. 
Accordingly, the MAH of the reference product, Circadin has provided consent to allow access to 
Module 2 to Module 5 of the initial dossier and any subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, 
assessed and approved. The complete assessment history of Circadin is available on the EMA website. 
The proposed indication for Melatonin Neurim is the same as the approved indication for the reference 
product.  
2.1.  Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Circadin application, the quality data in support of 
the Melatonin Neurim application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Circadin dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Circadin application, the non-clinical data in 
support of the Melatonin Neurim application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Circadin 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
The Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Melatonin Neurim 2 mg prolonged-release tablets was 
performed according to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2, 2006, and the Question and Answers document of the 
same Guideline (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1, 2016). 
Melatonin Neurim is considered to be a true duplicate of Circadin since it will have the same of 
qualitative and quantitative composition in terms of active substance and the same pharmaceutical 
form. In this context, the authorization of the present applicant will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the active substance in the environment. Therefore, Melatonin Neurim 2 mg prolonged-
release tablets is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Circadin application, the clinical data in support of 
the Melatonin Neurim application are identical to the up-to-date quality data of the Circadin dossier, 
which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.4.  Risk Management Plan 
The RMP is in line with the approved EU-RMP version 8.0 of the cross-referred medicinal product. 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 8 is acceptable.

2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
the package leaflet is identical in layout and core content to the approved leaflet for Circadin 2 mg 
prolonged-release tablets, additional readability testing is not considered necessary.

The overall benefit/risk balance of Melatonin Neurim is positive, subject to the conditions stated in 
section ‘Recommendations’.

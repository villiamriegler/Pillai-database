2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Acute  Bacterial  Skin  and  Skin  Structure  Infections  (ABSSSI)  are  among  the  most  common  human 
bacterial infections and include cellulitis, erysipelas, wound infections (traumatic or post-surgical) and 
major  abscesses.  Cellulitis  and  abscesses  are  commonly  encountered  in  the  community  setting  and 
frequently result in hospitalisation. ABSSSI such as surgical site infections and burn infections are also 
seen in the hospital setting. Both erysipelas and cellulitis are characterised by rapidly spreading areas of 
oedema, redness, and heat, sometimes accompanied by lymphangitis and enlargement of the regional 
lymph  nodes.  ABSSSI  are  a  common  indication  for  antibiotic  use  in  Europe  and  are  associated  with 
considerable  morbidity.  Data  from  the  European  Centre  for  Disease  Prevention  and  Control  (ECDC) 
estimated  that  4%  of  all healthcare-acquired  infections  (HAI)  reported  between  2011  and  2012  were 
ABSSSI,  with  surgical-site  infections  being  the  second  most  frequently  reported  HAI  (19.6%)  (ECDC, 
Surveillance report 2011–2012). 
Management of ABSSSI is dependent on the clinical presentation and the severity of the infection. Initial 
treatment  of  ABSSSI  is  usually  empirical  because  culture  results  are  not  immediately  available,  and 
patients with ABSSSI benefit from rapid initiation of appropriate therapy (Clinical guideline (CG74), NICE 
2014).  Most  streptococci  remain  susceptible  to  penicillin  and  β-lactam  antibiotics,  providing  many 
treatment options for adults when culture results are known. Infections due to MRSA are more complex in 
terms of management in hospital because of the additional steps that must be implemented for their 
treatment (e.g. decolonisation, protective clothing for nurses, isolation units, more expensive antibiotics, 
frequent laboratory tests, or blood cultures).  
When MRSA is identified as a single pathogen, a number of treatment options are available in Europe, 
including  vancomycin,  daptomycin,  linezolid,  tigecycline,  tedizolid,  oritavancin,  dalbavancin,  and 
ceftaroline.  Agents  like  vancomycin,  linezolid,  and  daptomycin  have  been  available  for  some  time. 
However, these older agents, along with many of the drugs more recently approved for ABSSSI, provide 
only  Gram-positive  coverage.  In  particular,  linezolid  is  one  of  the  most  used  agents  for  an  empirical 
starting of the treatment due to its activity against aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive organisms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 9/123 
 
 
 
 
 
Ceftaroline and tigecycline are active against Gram-negative organisms but are only available in an IV 
formulation.  Cephalosporins,  carbapenems  (meropenem,  imipenem),  and  ureido-penicillins  (such  as 
piperacillin),  aminoglycosides,  or  quinolone  antibacterials  can  be  used  to  provide  Gram-negative 
coverage in these situations, as well. In cases where MRSA and Gram-negative organisms are isolated, 
these  agents  can  be  added  to  MRSA  active  agents.  Among  the  fluoroquinolone  class,  levofloxacin, 
ofloxacin and moxifloxacin may be indicated for complicated Skin and Soft Structure Infections (cSSSI) 
with some limitations, on the basis of the high rate of MRSA resistant to both levofloxacin and ofloxacin 
and the known safety profile of fluoroquinolones. It should be considered that in the EU moxifloxacin and 
levofloxacin are currently only approved as last line indication cSSTI due to safety concerns. Furthermore, 
the originator of ofloxacin adapted the PI regarding the indication cSSTI (last line) to be in line with the 
approved indications of levofloxacin.  
Delafloxacin possesses both Gram-positive / MRSA and Gram-negative activity and a potential improved 
safety profile in respect to the other fluoroquinolones. It offers the flexibility of both IV and oral treatment 
of ABSSSI, with a considerable reduction of hospitalisation costs and related risks and does not require 
therapeutic  drug  monitoring.  These  factors  support  the  addition  of  delafloxacin  to  the  ABSSSI 
armamentarium. 
The most common bacteria identified in ABSSSI are Gram-positive pathogens, including streptococci and 
staphylococci.  In  Europe,  the  most  frequently  isolated  Gram-positive  ABSSSI  pathogen  is  S.  aureus 
(including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA)), followed 
by β-haemolytic streptococci. The prevalence of MRSA has increased worldwide in both healthcare- and 
community-based settings. In Europe, the prevalence of MRSA varies greatly across countries, with much 
higher frequencies seen in southern and south-eastern countries. Based on the European Antimicrobial 
Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net), the European population-weighted mean percentage for 
MRSA  was  13.7%  in  2016,  ranging  from  1.2%  in  the  Netherlands  to  50.5%  in  Romania  (ECDC, 
Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Europe, 2016).  
In particular, in patients with comorbidities and those previously treated with antibiotics, ABSSSI can 
often  be  polymicrobial,  with  Gram-negative  and  obligate  anaerobic  pathogens  found  together  with 
Gram-positive  organisms.  Gram-negative  aetiology  is  common  in  surgical-site  infections  setting  as 
reported in the SENTRY programme (1998 – 2004), with P. aeruginosa being the second most important 
pathogen after MRSA, followed by E. coli.  
Drug-resistant bacteria are playing an increasing role as causative pathogens in ABSSSI.  
P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. can play an important 
role in polymicrobial long-standing infections such as diabetic foot infection and decubiti, but are also 
increasingly  recognised  in  monomicrobial  ABSSSI.  The  presence  of  MRSA  in  surgical  site  infections  is 
independently associated with mortality compared with patients with MSSA. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Delafloxacin N-methylglucamine salt (delafloxacin meglumine) hereafter referred to as delafloxacin is an 
anionic  fluoroquinolone  with  broad-spectrum  activity  including  Gram-positive  and  Gram-negative 
bacteria. It binds to both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV thereby preventing bacterial DNA replication 
and transcription. Unlike other fluoroquinolones it is anionic at physiological pH and uncharged at acidic 
pH  (≤  5.5).  As  the  non-ionised  form  of  a  drug  better  penetrates  through  biological  membranes, 
delafloxacin accumulates particularly in bacteria in acidic environments such as infection sites thereby 
improving its potency.

2.2.3.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of delafloxacin meglumine is (D-glucitol, 1-deoxy-1-(methylamino)-, 
1-(6-amino-3,5-difluoro-2-pyridinyl)-8-chloro-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(3-hydroxy-1-azetidinyl)-4-oxo-3 
quinolinecarboxylate) corresponding to the molecular formula C18H12ClF3N4O4.C7H17NO5. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 635.97 Da g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of delafloxacin meglumine was elucidated by a combination of IR, UV-VIS, 
1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and 19F-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Information on molar absorptivity 
has also been provided.  
The delafloxacin meglumine is a crystalline white to tan powder, it belongs to BCS Class 4, has pH 
dependent solubility in aqueous media and is hygroscopic in nature. The aqueous solubility of delafloxacin 
meglumine increases with pH (from < 0.10 mg/mL to 32 mg/mL at pH values ≤ 6 and pH 9, respectively). 
The solubility of delafloxacin meglumine in most organic solvents is low (< 3 mg/mL in acetone,

Page 11/123 
 
 
 
 
 
acetonitrile, 1-butanol, dichloromethane, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate). Higher solubility was 
measured for the compound in methanol (6 mg/mL). 
The acid component (delafloxacin) has no chiral centres. The base component (N-methylglucamine = 
meglumine) exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres.  
Polymorphism has been observed for delafloxacin meglumine. A stable form 1A, a metastable form 1B 
and a trihydrate have been observed. Form 1A is a variable hemihydrate, which is kinetically stable over 
a wide relative humidity range and only converting to the trihydrate at very high relative humidity (> 
90%).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Delafloxacin meglumine is synthesized in five main steps using well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
Potential and actual impurities have been adequately discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been 
justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered 
to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in in double low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags sealed and placed 
inside a high density polyethylene (HDPE) drum and secured with a HDPE pail cover. The LDPE bags are 
manufactured  from  granules  complying  with  Ph.  Eur.  3.1.4  and  the  food  contact  EC  directive  (EU 
10/2011). 
Specification 
The active substance specification shown in Table 1 includes tests for appearance, identity (FT-IR), 
identification of delafloxacin (HPLC), identification of N-methylglucamine (ion chromatography, IC), 
assay (HPLC), N-methylglucamine content (IC), impurities (HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), residual 
solvents (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur), particle size (light scattering), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.), and 
bacterial endotoxin (Ph. Eur.). 
The limits set two specified identified impurities have been tightened in line with batch and stability data. 
The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate the limit of one impurity as soon as additional batch data 
will become available. The omission of the test for polymorphic form 1A from the specifications is justified 
based on the presence of the IPC during the manufacturing process and the provision of stability data.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. However, the applicant is recommended to develop and 
validate an improved method for assessing the microbiological purity of the active substance and the 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis data on 14 batches of active substance, of which 4 were manufactured at commercial 
scale, were provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three pilot-scale and three commercial-scale batches of active substance 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure system representative of that 
intended for the market for up to 36 months (pilot batches) and 24 months (commercial batches) under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The parameters tested were appearance, water 
content, assay, related substances, particle size, polymorphic form and microbial testing. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. All tested parameters were 
within the specifications. Only minimal degradation was observed under accelerated conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Minor photolytic 
degradation was observed with light exposure in an open container. No photolytic degradation was 
observed when the active substance was packaged in the representative container. Results under 
stressed conditions (heat, heat with humidity and exposure to oxygen) were also provided on one batch 
and confirm that delafloxacin meglumine in the solid state is stable under stressed conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable when packaged in a light protective container. The stability results justify the proposed 
retest period of 36 months with the recommendation for storage “Store in the original package, in order 
to protect from light”.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. During the procedure, 
it has been confirmed that sulfobutylbetadex sodium is compliant with the recently implemented 
monograph published in version 9.6 of the Ph. Eur., which came into force in July 2019. Throughout the 
report sulfobutylbetadex sodium is also referred to as sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBECD), betadex 
sulfobutyl ether sodium or Captisol; these names are used interchangeably. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility of the active 
substance with the excipients was confirmed via means of binary studies and stability data. 
Prior to administration, the powder is reconstituted with sterile 5% dextrose solution or 0.9% saline 
solution for a final volume of 12.4 mL, equivalent to the target fill volume in the vial prior to lyophilisation. 
The target fill volume has been adjusted to allow withdrawal of the labelled amount of active substance. 
Each 12.0 mL of the reconstituted solution provides a 300 mg dose. The reconstituted solution is further 
diluted with 5% dextrose solution or 0.9% Saline solution in a 250 mL infusion bag for administration. The 
variability in appearance has no impact on reconstitution of the powder under the proposed conditions. 
There are no accompanying reconstitution diluents with the finished product. The description of 
reconstitution and dilution process and use of acceptable diluents have been evaluated during the 
development and are further described and discussed under the finished product stability section. 
The formulation used during phase III clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. The 
formulation development has been described in sufficient details.  
The development of Delafloxacin 300 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is considered a 
traditional development program from a Quality by Design perspective. However principles, as described 
in ICH Q8, were utilised to guide the formulation and manufacturing process development.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as: 
•  A dosage form for IV administration as a concentrate for dilution (preferred) or as a lyophilized 
powder for reconstitution and dilution; 
•  A shelf life of at least 18 months at room temperature (preferred) or refrigerated conditions; 
•  Well tolerated formulation; 
• 
•  Use of compendially precedented excipients. 
Product to be manufactured using a standard and scalable manufacturing process; 
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were: appearance of the product before and after 
reconstitution, appearance of the vial and closure, identification, assay, impurities, uniformity of dosage 
units, pH of the reconstituted solution, sterility, bacterial endotoxin, particulate matter, water content, 
reconstitution time and container closure integrity. Adequate argumentation has been provided in 
support of the fact that osmolarity of the reconstituted solution, extractable volume/container content 
and polymorphic form are not considered CQAs.  
The formulation development has been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the 
critical material attributes. The risk identification was based on experience from formulation and process 
development. The critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
The primary packaging is 20 ml clear type I glass vials outfitted with 20 mm type I rubber stoppers and 
20 mm flip-off caps. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process,  shown  in  Figure  3  along  with  the  IPCs,  consists  of  five  main  steps: 
preparation of bulk solution, sterile filtration, filling and pre-stoppering of vials, lyophilisation, stoppering, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 14/123 
 
 
 
 
 
and capping/crimping of vials. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process 
(sterile  filtration).  In  response  to  a  major  objection  raised  during  the  procedure,  the  applicant  has 
adequately  justified  the  choice  of  the  sterilisation  method  according  to  the  Ph.  Eur.  5.1.1  and  the 
“Decision Trees for the Selection of sterilization Methods” (CPMP/QWP/054/98): both the dry heat and the 
gamma  irradiation  terminal  sterilisation  methods  would  lead  to  an  unacceptable  increase  in  impurity 
content and decrease in assay. 
The critical manufacturing steps have been identified (pH adjustment prior to active substance addition, 
complete dissolution of the active substance, bioburden test before second filtration and vial filling). The 
process is sufficiently controlled by IPCs (test on bulk solution, filter integrity test, and fill weight) and are 
adequate for a product manufactured by sterile filtration. The suitability of the manufacturing process has 
been  sufficiently  demonstrated  by  process  validation  data  on  three  consecutive  commercial  scale 
batches. The suitability of the aseptic processing has been demonstrated by media fill studies.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  powder  for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  release  specifications  shown  in  Table  3  include 
appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance of the product before and after reconstitution, 
appearance  of  the  vial  and  closure,  identification  (HPLC  and  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), pH of the reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins, (Ph. 
Eur.) sterility (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), and reconstitution time 
and container closure integrity (in-house method, visual). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The analysis of the 
contribution of the finished product components to the elemental impurity levels confirms that all 
elements of concern that are potentially present in the finished product would be present at levels 
significantly below the PDE stated in ICHQ3D. Based on the risk assessment, it can be concluded that it 
is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental 
impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for four commercial scale batches and three pilot scale batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from four pilot scale batches (validation batches) of finished product stored for up to 48 
months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  ICH  stability  studies  for  one 
commercials-scale batch over 24 months at long-term conditions and 6 months at accelerated conditions 
have been provided. The batches of Quofenix powder for concentrate for solution for infusion are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.

Samples were tested according to the stability specification which includes all the release specification 
tests. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The results meet the specifications and no 
significant changes or trends in any of the tested parameters were observed. The proposed limits are 
considered acceptable; however, the applicant is recommended to evaluate tightening the assay limit in 
the shelf-life specification as soon as additional stability data for commercial scale batches are available 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant trend is also observed in the photostability study. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months and without any particular storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.5.  Finished medicinal product: Tablets 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Delafloxacin tablet, 450 mg, is an immediate release, capsule-shaped tablet, of beige to mottled beige

update the specification of microcrystalline cellulose and crospovidone with the defined functional 
characteristics. The specification of microcrystalline cellulose has been integrated with particle size 
distribution and bulk density. The specification of crospovidone was updated with loss on drying only. The 
applicant is recommended to evaluate the functional characteristics of crospovidone and update the 
excipient specification as applicable

The aim of the oral formulation development was to achieve in vivo exposure equivalent to that of the 300 
mg IV formulation to allow for switching between the two formulations. 
Delafloxacin formulations were initially developed by two different companies. For Phase I and Phase II 
clinical studies, two capsule formulations were developed: 1. Formulation A consisting of active substance 
only and 2. Formulation B consisting of formulated capsules (wet granulation of delafloxacin meglumide 
with povidone, pre-gelatinised starch, microcrystalline cellulose, and silicon dioxide). In addition, two 
prototype tablet formulations (Formulations C and D) were developed for use in a comparative 
bioavailability study; each tablet contains delafloxacin meglumide, povidone (in formulation C only), 
crospovidone, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate. Several other oral formulations 
(formulations E through J), were developed to be used in the clinical trials together with IV formulation.  
The formulation development has been described in sufficient details. 
The development of the dissolution method has been described. The dissolution test used for Phase 3 was 
modified so that the solubility is less than sink conditions with the proposed acceptance criteria. A study 
has demonstrated that the dissolution rates and discriminatory ability of the two methods are comparable 
over  the  entire  range  of  formulation  and  manufacturing  variables  explored;  hence,  methods  are 
comparable at all time points tested. Data generated on tablet alterations that would potentially produce 
slower  dissolution  profiles  (i.e.  reducing  the  amount  of  disintegrant  in  both  the  intra-granular  and 
extra-granular  portions  of  the  tablet  blend,  increasing  the  amount  of  magnesium  stearate  and  the 
wet-massing  time  of  the  granulation,  and  compressing  the  tablets  to  different  hardness  values), 
confirmed that the discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated.  
The primary packaging is unit dose laminated aluminium/aluminium foil blisters. The materials comply 
with EC requirements. The blisters are purged with ultra-high purity nitrogen just prior to heat sealing to 
reduce  oxidation  of  the  tablets.  Both  aluminium-aluminium  foil  blistering  materials  provide  suitable 
protection in terms of providing a barrier to light and in preventing oxygen and moisture vapour ingress. 
Absence of pinholes is assured by the pinhole detector of the blistering machine.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: high-shear granulation, fluid bed drying, screening 
and  milling  of  dried  granules,  blending  and  lubrication,  compression,  and  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The IPCs and associated acceptance criteria are provided. The critical steps of the manufacturing process 
are the fluid bed drying of the wet granules and compression of the final blend and both are considered to 
be adequately controlled. Three consecutive commercial scale batches have been manufactured using the 
commercial manufacturing process, demonstrating that the process consistently produces delafloxacin 
tablets, 450 mg that meet the predetermined specifications and quality attributes. 
Product specification  
The tablet release and shelf life specifications shown in Table 7: Tablet release and shelf-life specifications 
include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, identification (HPLC and UV), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of Dosage Units (HPLC), water (Ph. Eur.) and 
microbial testing (Ph. Eur.). The shelf-life specification is identical to the release specification. The limits 
proposed have been adequately justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 17/123 
 
 
 
 
assessment it was concluded that the risk of contamination with elemental impurities is low so it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information 
on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three commercial batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  During  the  review,  data  from  three  commercial  scale 
batches  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under  long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH),  were  provided  to 
address a major objection. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for 
marketing and packed in the primary packaging representative of the primary container closure proposed 
for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the same tests listed in the release specification. The analytical procedures used 
are  stability  indicating.  The  results  meet  the  specifications  and  no  significant  trend  in  any  of  the 
parameters tested was observed.  
In addition, three batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of  New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  During  the  study,  a  change  in  the  colour  of  the  tablets  was 
observed. The recommendation for storage (light sensitivity) is therefore required and included in the 
SmPC and PIL. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months stored in the original package in 
order to protect from light as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented and updated in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the two finished products should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major 
objections on the justification of the choice of the sterilisation method for the concentrate for solution for 
infusion and on the substantiation of the proposed shelf life of the tablet have been satisfactorily 
addressed during the procedure. Clear instructions for preparation and handling of the reconstituted 
solutions for infusion have been included in the SmPC.

2.2.7.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of the two products is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.8.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP the CHMP recommends several points for investigation as described above.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Delafloxacin meglumine is a novel anionic fluoroquinolone with binding affinity to both DNA gyrase and 
topoisomerase IV. The delafloxacin molecule exhibits different chemical features compared to other 
fluoroquinolones, i.e. delafloxacin shifts from an anion at physiological pH to a non-ionised (zwitterion) 
structure at acidic pH (≤ 5.5). 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Refer to the clinical assessment. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamics  program  explored  potential  off-target  activity  of  delafloxacin  in 
screens  including  75  radioligand  binding  assays.  These  assessments  included  in  vitro  evaluations  of 
receptor subtypes for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), benzodiazepine (BZD), N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA), adenosine, and muscarinic ligands, targets previously implicated in the neurological symptoms 
of marketed fluoroquinolones, as well as in tendinopathies. The results of these studies demonstrated no 
noteworthy or clinically relevant inhibition of radioligand binding to such receptors. For the metabolites 
M3 and M5 (ester glucuronides), major metabolites of delafloxacin seen in rats, dogs, and humans, no 
further pharmacological characterization or specific studies are required based on calculated exposure 
rates  in  performed  toxicological  studies  and  data,  which  clearly  demonstrate  that  the  unchanged 
delafloxacin is the predominant circulating compound in urine and plasma following oral and intravenous 
administration. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
An extensive core battery of central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and respiratory evaluations 
were conducted with delafloxacin, including supplemental gastrointestinal (GI) evaluations. In several 
studies, the effects of delafloxacin were compared to those of other fluoroquinolones. These studies did 
not indicate a risk to human safety at delafloxacin plasma concentrations exceeding those observed in 
clinical studies.  
These studies were originally conducted prior to full implementation of the ICHS7 guidance on Safety 
Pharmacology and thus were not conducted in accordance with GLP but were more extensive than those 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 19/123 
 
 
 
 
 
outlined in the ICHS7 Core Battery. Furthermore, these studies were conducted under compliance with 
standard operating procedures ensuring data quality, integrity and reliability. 
CNS: An extensive battery of CNS evaluations was conducted with delafloxacin after oral administration 
in  mice  and  rats.  Doses  in  mice  up  to  300  mg/kg  (a  dose  associated  with  mean  Cmax  values  at  least 
approximately 5-fold greater than that observed in humans following therapeutic IV dosing (9.29 µg/mL) 
had no consistent effects on general behaviour, motor coordination, body temperature, nociception, and 
barbital- or ethanol-induced sleep, although transient sedation was observed. At a high dose of 1000 
mg/kg, transient signs of CNS stimulation (excitation with hypersensitivity to external stimuli) prior to 
sedation were observed. Delafloxacin also had no meaningful effects on the electro-shock threshold and 
latency  to  pentylenetetrazole  (PTZ)-induced  convulsions  in  mice  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested  (300 
mg/kg). In contrast, trovafloxacin, and norfloxacin decreased the time to PTZ-induced tonic convulsions 
and / or death at comparable doses. Delafloxacin did not cause convulsions when co-administered with 
fenbufen, a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) reported to induce seizures in humans when 
co-administered with enoxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone; accordingly, a non-convulsant dose 
of enoxacin induced convulsions in mice when co-administered with fenbufen. 
Taken together, these results suggest the absence of clear CNS activity for delafloxacin in mice and rats 
after p.o. administration up to 300 mg/kg. 
Cardiovascular:  There  was  no  significant  inhibition  of  the  delayed  rectifier  potassium  current  in 
hERG-transfected  HEK-293  cells  up  to  75  µg/mL  and  no  significant  prolongation  of  action  potential 
duration  in  dog  Purkinje  fibres  up  to  50  µg/mL,  both  concentrations  being  the  highest  tested.  The 
no-effect concentration of 50 µg/mL is 33-fold greater than the unbound human Cmax plasma level at the 
therapeutic IV dose. 
Also, QTc prolongation was not observed in instrumented dogs following IV administration of delafloxacin 
up to plasma concentrations of 121 µg/mL (13 x therapeutic Cmax following repeat IV dosing). At these 
high plasma concentrations there was a transient increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and a transient 
decrease in mean arterial pressure and contractile function which quickly returned to baseline as peak 
plasma levels declined. 
A  thorough  contemporary  QT  clinical  study,  which  included  the  positive  control  moxifloxacin, 
demonstrated no QT prolongation risk following administration of delafloxacin to humans. 
Respiratory  System:  delafloxacin  produced  no  statistically  significant  effects  on  any  respiratory 
parameter relative to the vehicle and thus does not affect respiratory function in rats at oral doses up to 
600 mg/kg, a dose which corresponds to at least twice the mean plasma Cmax observed in humans after 
IV administration. 
Gastrointestinal System: delafloxacin had no significant effect on GI transit times in rats up to  
100 mg/kg orally, indicating no physiologically significant effect on stomach emptying or small intestinal 
motility. However, the ferret model indicated a potential for emesis and diarrhoea. 
In toxicology studies, GI effects have been observed in rats and dogs with delafloxacin administered 
either orally or IV and are characterized primary as abnormal stool, dilated caecum, and decreased food 
intake and / or body weight in rats, and emesis and abnormal stool / diarrhoea in dogs. As no microscopic 
signs of GI injury have been seen with delafloxacin in rats and dogs up to 3 months in duration, the GI 
effects observed in toxicology studies were not considered serious or adverse.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  specific  studies  on  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  have  been  conducted  but  in  safety 
pharmacology studies no meaningful pharmacodynamic drug interactions of delafloxacin with fenbufen, 
barbital, or ethanol in mice did occur. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  conducted  pharmacokinetic  (ADME)  studies  were  conducted  in  mice,  rats,  dogs,  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys  following  oral  and  /  or  IV  administration  of  delafloxacin  and  used  analytical  methods  were 
sufficiently validated and are considered adequate for toxicokinetics of the toxicology studies. 
Delafloxacin was rapidly absorbed from the GI tract following oral administration of solution formulations 
to mice, rats and dogs, with absolute bioavailability of > 50% in mice and dogs and approximately 28% 
in rats when tested at 5 mg/kg. PK of delafloxacin was linear, it did not change with repeat doses and it 
did not show potential for accumulation or gender-related differences. Food was shown to decrease the 
systemic exposure to orally administered delafloxacin by about 2-fold in rats and dogs independent of 
formulation  used.  Similar  to  delafloxacin,  the  meglumine  salt  of  delafloxacin  (the  salt  form  used  for 
clinical trials) was also rapidly absorbed from the GI tract when delivered as an oral suspension in 0.2% 
hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) to rats or as neat drug substance in gelatin capsules to dogs.  
Delafloxacin  exhibits  a  high  protein  binding,  the  rank  order  for  mean  protein  binding  across  various 
species was mouse (97.0%) > rat (91.5%) > human (83.7%) > monkey (78.9%) > dog (75.1%). The 
majority of delafloxacin protein binding in human plasma has been identified as albumin.  
Delafloxacin PK in animals is characterised by low plasma clearance (relative to hepatic blood flow) and a 
moderate to high volume of distribution (i.e. indicating good-to-excellent distribution into the tissues) 
followed  by  rapid  elimination  from  non-pigmented  as  well  as  pigmented  tissue.  Unlike  other 
fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin does not specifically bind to melanin as it is anionic at physiological pH. 
Little-to-no tissue uptake is seen in CNS tissues or cartilage, but trace levels of 14C-delafloxacin were seen 
in bone up to 3 weeks following a single dose. In the whole-body autoradiography study the trace levels 
of  14C-delafloxacin were seen in bone up to 3 weeks (504 h) following a single dose (RBX-01). A new 
tissue  distribution  study  (MEL/01),  completed  in  2018,  used  a  more  sophisticated  quantitative 
whole-body autoradiography technology that allows differentiation between labelling of mineral bone and 
labelling of the endosteum. In this study only Below the Limit of accurate Quantification (BLQ) levels in 
bone (true mineral bone) following similar oral and IV doses to pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were 
observed.  The  applicant  has  also  clarified  that  the  reversible  delayed ossification in  foetuses  in  study 
R&D/01/534, is a sign of growth retardation due to decreased food consumption in treated mothers and 
the direct effect of delafloxacin on foetal tissue is negligible.  
Placental  transfer  of  delafloxacin  was  shown  after  single  dose  application  in  pregnant  rats  with  foetal 
levels approximately reaching 10% of maternal blood levels. A study comparing the tissue distribution of 
oral  and  the  Captisol  containing  IV  formulation  showed  that  the  distribution  of  delafloxacin  in  foetal 
tissues, maternal reproductive organs and maternal organs (blood, brain, liver, muscle) was not altered 
by the presence of Captisol.  
Delafloxacin is minimally metabolised by CYP450 and undergoes direct glucuronidation. In rats, dogs and 
humans, unchanged delafloxacin was the major radioactive species in plasma.  
Following both oral and IV dosing, unchanged delafloxacin is the major radioactive component in faeces 
from rats (70% to 80% of total dose), dogs (62% to 64% of total dose), and humans (oral  
~ 48%, IV ~ 28% of total dose). The ester glucuronide of delafloxacin is also found in plasma of rats, 
dogs, and humans. Although plasma levels of the ester glucuronide in rats and dogs are low relative to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 21/123 
 
 
 
 
humans, high levels of these metabolites (M3, M5) are found in bile of rats and dogs indicating substantial 
hepatic exposure. Ester glucuronides are also found in urine of rats, dogs, and humans. All metabolites 
found in vivo in humans have been found in rats and dogs, except M6A, a minor ether glucuronide found 
in human urine at 1.5% of the total dose and also identified in human urine (1.5% of total dose).  
After  oral  and  IV  dosing  in  rats  and  dogs,  approximately  90%  of  delafloxacin-derived  radioactivity  is 
eliminated after dosing within 96 h (rats), 120 h (dogs), and 72 h (humans). Of the total radioactive dose, 
faecal elimination accounted for 70% to 80% in rats, 85% to 88% in dog, and 48% (oral) and 28% (IV) 
in humans, with the remaining eliminated via urine. Biliary excretion is a major route of elimination in rats 
and dogs. Although at a lesser extent than rats and dogs, biliary clearance and transintestinal elimination 
may also play a role in the excretion of delafloxacin in humans. In humans, 50% to 65% of the dose is 
eliminated via urine. 
Radiolabelled  delafloxacin  was  orally  applied  to  nursing  rats.  Radiolabel  was  detected  in  the  milk  of 
nursing rats with milk to plasma ratios of 8.5 to 4.0 and in the stomach of nursed pups at approximately 
10-fold maternal plasma levels. 
The potential of delafloxacin to precipitate DDIs appears minimal, if any. The metabolism of the drug by 
cytochromes P450 is negligible, and the drug does not inhibit drug transporters such as MDR1 and BCRP 
at  clinically  relevant  concentrations.  Likewise,  only  a  minor  inhibitory  effect  of  the  drug  on 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferases was detected at very high concentrations. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
Single- and Repeat-dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity of delafloxacin was studied in mice, rats and dogs. Following single oral doses mortality in 
mice and rats occurred at doses ≥ 1664 mg/kg, however, no deaths occurred in rats administered twice 
daily (BID) doses of 800 mg/kg / dose (1600 mg/kg). In dogs, single doses of up to 320 mg/kg were 
non-lethal, but dose-related emesis or diarrhoea occurred at ≥ 40 mg/kg or ≥ 80 mg/kg following oral as 
well  as  IV  administration.  Following  single  60  minute  IV  infusion  of  120  and  150  mg/kg,  no 
delafloxacin-related deaths occurred in rats and dogs. 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  and  dogs  administered  either  oral  doses  of 
delafloxacin for up to 13 weeks in duration or by IV infusions (60 to 90 minute) for up to 4 weeks. Thus, 
treatment periods in animal studies are well beyond the recommended clinical use, which is limited to 5 
to 14 days. The pivotal studies in rats and dogs included clinical and anatomic pathology examinations 
along with toxicokinetic (TK) evaluations. 
Oral administration to rats for 3 months (with 4 week reversal period) resulted in caecal dilatation in both 
studies at all doses (BID 100, 300 or 600/800 mg/kg i.e. total daily exposure of 200, 600 and 1200/1600 
mg/kg). At the highest dose at 1600 mg/kg, reversible decreased body weight, food consumption and 
abnormal  stool  in  both  sexes  were  noted.  Parallel  to  the  clinical  signs,  a  reversible,  dose-dependent 
decrease  in  serum  globulin  levels  occurred  at  ≥  600  mg/kg.  Other  clinical  signs  noted  were  noisy 
respiration and matted hair on muzzle; at the highest dose (1600 mg/kg) animals of both sexes exhibited 
statistically  significant  increases  in  adrenal  gland  weight,  and  decreases  in  the  absolute  prostate  and 
thymus weights in males. As there were no histopathologic changes in the examined tissues, these organ 
effects  are  considered  stress  related.  NOAEL  in  rats  following  oral  administration  for  3  months  was 
established in both genders as 600 mg/kg.  
Oral administration to dogs for 3 months (with 4-week recovery period) resulted in emesis, salivation, 
and abnormal stool / diarrhoea (0, 80, 160 and 320 mg/kg/day). The incidence and severity of these 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 22/123 
 
 
 
 
findings  were  dose-dependent.  At  various  time  points  during  this  study  increased  alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and / or gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) was 
noted  (3M,  1F),  but  returned  to  near  baseline  at  the  end  of  the  recovery  period.  No  histopathologic 
changes were observed in the livers of these dogs and, electron microscopy of samples of liver from 2 of 
the  males  showed  no  ultrastructural  changes.  Thus,  the  NOAEL  identified  for  dogs  administered 
delafloxacin via gelatine capsule for 3 months was considered 160 mg/kg / day. 
In rats IV infusions of delafloxacin was administered in two pivotal studies, i.e. daily for a duration of 60 
minutes (0, 10, 60 and 180 mg/kg) or 90 minutes (0, 10, 75 and 150 mg/kg/day) for two or four weeks 
(with 1-week or 2-week recovery). Mortality occurred at doses ≥ 150 mg/kg/day. Decreases in mean 
body  weights  (males)  and  /  or  food  consumption  (males  and  females)  occurred  at  doses  of  ≥  120 
mg/kg/day. In the 2-week study, reversible, statistically significant decreases in mean absolute / relative 
liver,  spleen  and  or  thymus  weights  occurred  at  ≥  60  mg/kg  /  day.  Similar  to  the  effects  after  oral 
administration, the decreases in organ weights were without histopathologic correlates and thus, were 
considered associated to the changes of body weight, food intake and / or stress-related. Histopathologic 
changes  in  the  rat  IV  toxicity  studies  secondary  to  the  dosing  procedure  (i.e.,  inflammation  at  the 
injection sites, thrombosis of the vena cava) were seen at all doses (including control). Based on the 
mortality  at  150  mg/kg/day,  the  NOAEL  in  both  male  and  female  rats  following  IV  infusion  for  4 
consecutive weeks was established as 75 mg/kg/day.  
In dogs two pivotal studies were performed following IV infusion for daily 60 minutes duration in both 
studies resulting into administered doses of 0, 10, 25 and 75 mg/kg for two or four weeks (with 1 or 2 
week(s) recovery), respectively. For doses of up to 75 mg/kg/day no deaths occurred, however, as seen 
with oral dosing, gastrointestinal (GI)-related clinical observations (e.g., emesis, mucoid or discoloured 
stools, diarrhoea) occurred at ≥ 25 mg/kg/day. At the high-dose in the 4-week study (75 mg/kg/day), 
notable increases in ALT and ALP occurred in 1 male and, slight increases in ALT and / or ALP were noted 
in 2 males and 1 female; no histopathologic changes were noted in any of the tissues examined from 
these dogs. In addition, reversible decreases in total protein and globulin values were recorded at the end 
of the treatment period for the 75 mg/kg/day males and were most likely secondary to the antibiotic 
related  changes  in  the  intestinal  environment  and  /  or  decreased  nutritional  status  resulting  from 
frequent emesis. Reversible increases in absolute / relative adrenal weights and kidney weights for the 75 
mg/kg  /  day  males,  without  histopathologic  correlates,  were  most  likely  stress-related.  Local 
histopathologic  changes  were  observed  at  or  near  the  injection  sites  in  dogs  at  all  doses  (including 
controls)  and  were  secondary  to  the  dosing  procedure  (i.e.,  inflammation,  haemorrhage,  and  muscle 
degeneration  /  regeneration  at  the  injection  sites).  Delafloxacin-related  changes  observed  during  the 
study essentially reversed at the end of the recovery period. Based on post-dose observations and the 
elevations in serum enzymes during the treatment period, the NOAEL in dogs administered delafloxacin 
by IV infusion for 4 consecutive weeks was set at 25 mg/kg/day. 
In the 4-week dog IV study the vehicle was a mixture of Captisol, meglumin, EDTA and sterile water, 
which is also used in the clinical IV formulation. Captisol (sulfobutyl ether of beta cyclodextrin) is a known 
excipient and functions as a solubilizer and stabilizer in infusion solutions. Reversible mild renal tubule 
vacuolation is known to be caused by Captisol in animal studies, but no cellular degeneration or loss of 
kidney function has been reported. More recently, the safe parenteral use for sulfobutyl ether of beta 
cyclodextrin doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and use for > 2 weeks was confirmed by the CHMP in the revised 
Q&A document on cyclodextrins (EMA/CHMP/495747/2013, published 09/10/2017). The intended clinical 
use of Quofenix 300 mg IV (contains 2.4 g SBECD per dose) twice a day results in an exposure below the 
reported safe dose of 10 g SBECD per day considering a body weight of 50 kg. 
Based on TK parameters established at NOAELs of the pivotal (oral/IV) repeat dose toxicity studies in rats 
and dogs and reported human plasma level following therapeutic treatment corresponding animal:human 
exposure multiples (“safety margins”) were calculated. In rats, safety margins are in the range of 1.3 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 23/123 
 
 
 
 
4 for AUC and in the range of 1.9 to 7.3 for Cmax, respectively. Comparably, the safety margins in dogs are 
lower,  i.e.  in  the  range  of  0.5  to  0.8  for  AUC  and  in  the  range  of  1.6  to  2.3  for  Cmax.  Taking  into 
consideration  the  good  toxicity  profile  of  delafloxacin,  the  established  exposure  margins  of  both 
formulations (oral and IV) do support therapeutic doses and a treatment duration up to 2 weeks. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity  
Delafloxacin was tested in vitro and in vivo for genotoxicity in a standard battery of test. The test results 
did not provide evidence for any clinically relevant genotoxic potential. 
Delafloxacin  is  not  intended  for  long  term  treatment  requiring  carcinogenicity  testing.  Therefore,  no 
carcinogenicity studies were performed. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity of delafloxacin was investigated in a study on fertility and early 
embryonic development and a pre-postnatal study with intravenous application of delafloxacin in the rat. 
Furthermore, embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with oral application 
of  delafloxacin.  Concomitantly  with embryo-foetal  development  studies  toxicokinetic  parameters  were 
evaluated. 
No adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development were noticed with IV administration of 
delafloxacin in rats up to 120 mg/kg/day. Parental toxicity was observed at 10 mg/kg/day. 
In  embryo-foetal  development  studies,  oral  application  of  delafloxacin  to  pregnant  rats  resulted  in 
reduced foetal weights at 1600 mg/kg/day and maternal toxicity and reversible foetal ossification delays 
at all doses studied. No malformations were observed. The maternal and developmental NOAEL was less 
than  200  mg/kg/day.  After  oral  application  to  pregnant  rabbits  no  adverse  effects  on  embryo-foetal 
development were observed up to the highest dose of 1.6 mg/kg/day. Since maternal toxicity was noticed 
the maternal NOAEL was established at 0.4 mg/kg/day. Altogether, rabbits are more susceptible towards 
some antibiotics and to disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, doses and resulting plasma 
levels of delafloxacin were much lower in the embryo-foetal development studies in rabbits than in rats. 
In  a  pre-postnatal  development  study  with  IV  administration  of  delafloxacin,  lower  body  weights  and 
longer gestation length were noticed for high dose dams (120 mg/kg/day). Adverse effects were also 
observed on F1 pups at that dose and included increased mortality during lactation, lower body weights 
and  small  stature.  However,  sexual  maturation,  sensory  function,  learning  and  memory  were  not 
affected. Reproductive performance of the F1 generation was also not impacted by delafloxacin treatment 
as well as F2 neonatal and early postnatal development. The NOAEL was established at 120 mg/kg/day. 
Exposure margin calculations were performed at the NOAEL of the reproductive toxicity studies towards 
human therapeutic exposure based on AUC. No effects were detected on male and female fertility in rats 
at 5-times human therapeutic exposures. Foetal effects occurred at an exposure level of about 2-fold in 
rats and below human therapeutic exposures in rabbits. Severe toxicity on neo-natal rats was observed in 
the  pre-postnatal  development  study  at  exposures  about  5-times  higher  than  in  humans  with  an 
exposure level of about two at the NOAEL. 
Local tolerance 
The haemolytic potential of delafloxacin and various delafloxacin placebo formulations was assessed in 
rat,  rabbit,  dog  and  human  blood.  The  local,  venous  and  peri-venous  irritation  of  delafloxacin  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 24/123 
 
 
 
 
assessed  in  rats  and  rabbits.  Delafloxacin  was  not  haemolytic  in  rat,  dog,  or  human  plasma;  but, 
produced local (subplantar), venous, and peri-venous irritation. However, these effects are not regarded 
as clinically relevant, but as a stress reaction to the dosing procedure. In the IV infusion studies in rat and 
dog on the general toxicology, various histopathological changes occurred at the injection sites, both in 
the treated animals and in the control animals. In Phase 3 clinical trials, such effects were not considered 
as a concern. 
There were no specific toxicology data regarding the antigenicity and immunotoxicity presented. With 
regards to immunotoxicity, a 3-month oral repeat dose toxicity study in rats indicated decreased thymic 
weight (atrophy). This is considered likely to be a treatment-related stress reaction, as following repeated 
delafloxacin IV administration there was no significant thymic atrophy seen in rats.  
Juvenile Toxicity 
To  elucidate  whether  delafloxacin  shows  chondrotoxicity  like  known  for  some  quinolone  antibiotics,  a 
study was performed in juvenile Beagle dogs. Up to the highest dose of 320 mg/kg/day p.o. no adverse 
effects were observed. However, delafloxacin is not currently intended for paediatric use and the study 
was therefore not considered for the present application.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Delafloxacin meglumine is a novel anionic fluoroquinolone with binding affinity to both DNA gyrase and 
topoisomerase  IV.  The  delafloxacin  molecule  exhibits  different  chemical  features  compared  to  other 
fluoroquinolones, i.e. delafloxacin shifts from an anion at physiological pH to a non-ionised (zwitterion) 
structure at acidic pH (≤ 5.5). Thus in acidic environments, characteristic of the milieu at infection sites, 
a  better  penetration  through  biological  membranes  may  lead  to  higher  accumulation  in  bacteria  and 
enhanced antimicrobial effectiveness.  
Results  from  a  core  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  including  the  CNS-,  cardiovascular-, 
respiratory- and gastrointestinal system did not indicate any risk to human safety at delafloxacin plasma 
concentrations  exceeding  those  observed  in  clinical  studies.  The  no  effect  concentration  for  in  vitro 
cardiovascular effects such as hERG current and action potential duration exceeds the unbound human 
Cmax plasma level at the therapeutic IV dose by ≥ 33-fold, and also in vivo in anesthetized dogs no QTc 
prolongation was recorded up to plasma concentration of 121 µg/mL, which is 13-fold greater than Cmax 
at therapeutic levels in humans following repeat IV dosing.  
In several studies, the effects of delafloxacin were compared to those of other fluoroquinolones. Following 
co-administration with the NSAID fenbufen, enoxacin but not delafloxacin did induce convulsions in mice. 
A  thorough  contemporary  QT  clinical  study,  which  included  the  positive  control  moxifloxacin, 
demonstrated no QT prolongation risk following administration of delafloxacin to humans. 
A complete set of pharmacokinetic studies addressing relevant ADME aspects of delafloxacin has been 
conducted in rodents and dogs. Delafloxacin PK in animals is characterized by low plasma clearance and 
a moderate to high volume of distribution followed by rapid elimination from non-pigmented as well as 
pigmented  tissue.  The  lack  of  binding  to  melanin  differs  from  other  fluoroquinolones  and  is  probably 
related to the fact that only delafloxacin is anionic at physiological pH. Little-to-no tissue uptake is seen 
in CNS tissues or cartilage. The distribution profile of delafloxacin in rats and dogs indicate that the new 
fluoroquinolone may offer some safety advantages with respect to uptake in CNS tissues or cartilage. 
Placental transfer of delafloxacin and excretion into milk was shown in rats. In the absence of human data 
and  findings  in  non-clinical  studies  at  human  therapeutic  exposures,  delafloxacin  is  contraindicated 
during pregnancy and lactation.  
One  additional  tissue  distribution  study  was  performed  to  compare  distribution  of  IV  and  oral 
14C-delafloxacin  in  pregnant  rats  during  the  period  of  organogenesis  in  order  to  determine  whether 
Captisol  might  provoke  differences  in  distribution  of  delafloxacin  to  foetal  and  maternal  tissues.  No 
differences in tissue distribution were detected. 
In  rats,  dogs  and  humans,  unchanged  delafloxacin  was  the  major  radioactive  species  in  plasma. 
Delafloxacin is minimally metabolised by CYP450 and undergoes direct glucuronidation. All metabolites 
found in vivo in humans have been found in rats and dogs, except M6A, a minor ether glucuronide found 
in human urine at 1.5% of the total dose. Thus, the chosen animal species and the proposed routes of 
administration are adequate for the performed toxicity studies. 
Faecal  elimination  (with  biliary  excretion)  predominates  in  rats  and  dogs  compared  to  lower  rates  in 
humans (48% oral, 28% IV), where 50% to 65% of the dose is eliminated via urine.

Based  on  in  vitro  drug  transporter  studies  (MDR1  and  BCRP)  and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases  data 
generated  at  clinically  relevant  doses,  there  is  only  a  low  potential  for  DDIs  following  delafloxacin 
administration. 
The conducted toxicology programme is considered appropriate for the proposed clinical use of the new 
fluoroquinolone antibiotic delafloxacin, i.e. the chosen animal species (rat and dog) are appropriate based 
on performed PK studies, toxicity in animals following both clinically relevant routes of administration 
(oral/IV) has been examined, and treatment periods in animal studies are well beyond the recommended 
clinical use.  
Repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs  following  both  routes  of  drug  administration  (oral/IV) 
revealed mainly dose-dependent gastrointestinal related clinical symptoms, such as caecal dilatation and 
abnormal stool (rat) or emesis, salvation, discoloured stools and diarrhoea (dog) beside decreased body 
weight. The repeated IV administration (up to two weeks/rats and up to four weeks/dogs) resulted in both 
species into local inflammatory reactions and secondary local histopathological changes at the injection 
site, which are not relevant for the intended short-term clinical use. In rats, stress related effects on 
adrenal gland weight (both sexes) and decreases in prostate and thymus (males) occurred and NOAEL 
was established as 600 mg/kg (oral) or 75 mg/kg/day (IV). In dogs, elevations in liver enzymes (ALT, ALP 
and/or GGT) occurred, but no corresponding histopathologic changes were noted in any of the tissues 
examined, thus NOAEL was considered 160 mg/kg/day (oral for 3 months ) or was set 25 mg/kg/day (IV 
for 4 weeks). Based on TK parameters established at NOAELs of the pivotal (oral/IV) repeat dose toxicity 
studies  and  reported  human  exposure  following  therapeutic  treatment  exposure  multiples  were 
calculated. In rats, safety margins are in the range of 1.3 to 4 for AUC and in the range of 1.9 to 7.3 for 
Cmax, respectively. Comparably, the safety margins in dogs are lower, i.e. in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 for 
AUC  and  in  the  range  of  1.6  to  2.3  for  Cmax.  Taking  into  consideration  the  good  toxicity  profile  of 
delafloxacin, the established exposure margins of both formulations (oral and IV) do support therapeutic 
doses and a treatment duration up to 2 weeks. In the 4-week dog IV study the vehicle was a mixture of 
Captisol,  meglumin,  EDTA  and  sterile  water,  which  is  also  used  in  the  clinical  IV  formulation.  More 
recently, the safe parenteral use for sulfobutyl ether of beta cyclodextrin doses up to 200 mg/kg/day and 
use for > 2 weeks was confirmed by the CHMP in the revised Q&A document on cyclodextrins, thus there 
is no safety concern with respect to the intended clinical use of Quofenix 300 mg IV. 
Delafloxacin was tested in vitro and in vivo for genotoxicity in a standard battery of test. The test results 
did not provide evidence for any clinically relevant genotoxic potential. No carcinogenicity studies were 
performed, which is acceptable as delafloxacin is not intended for long term treatment. 
No effects on fertility or early embryonic development were observed in a study with IV administration of 
up to 120 mg/kg/day delafloxacin to rats.  
No malformations were noticed in embryo-foetal development studies performed with oral application of 
delafloxacin to rats or rabbits. Reversible ossification delays and maternal toxicity were the main findings 
in rats starting at the lowest dose of 200 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, no adverse effects on embryo-foetal 
development were observed up to 1.6 mg/kg/day. However, rabbits were extremely sensitive towards 
treatment with delafloxacin. It is known that antibiotics may lead to disturbances of the gastrointestinal 
tract.  Therefore,  doses  and  resulting  plasma  levels  in  the  embryo-foetal  development  studies  with 
delafloxacin in rabbits are much lower than in rats. 
In  a  pre-postnatal  development  study  with  i.v.  administration  to  rats  maternal  toxicity  and  impaired 
neonatal development of F1 pups was observed along with the excretion of delafloxacin in maternal milk 
with  a  respective  NOAEL  of  60  mg/kg/day.  Therefore,  the  contraindication  of  delafloxacin  during 
breast-feeding is recommended.

Delafloxacin was not haemolytic in rat, dog, or human plasma, but produced local (subplantar), venous, 
and peri-venous irritation. However, these effects are not regarded as clinically relevant, but as a stress 
reaction to the dosing procedure.  
Twenty-seven  potential  impurities  were  screened  in  silico  or  tested  in  follow  up  genotoxicity  tests  or 
repeated dose toxicity studies and did not raise relevant concerns. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the non-clinical data do not point to any major concerns and that the clinically 
relevant findings have been adequately addressed in the Quofenix product information. 
The  conducted  toxicology  programme  is  considered  appropriate  for  the  proposed  clinical  use  of 
delafloxacin, as both clinical routes of administration (oral/IV) and the intended treatment duration of up 
to 2 weeks have been sufficiently studied in animals. 
No final conclusions on the environmental risk assessment is currently possible and the CHMP considers 
the following measure to be necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
The  applicant  commits  to  complete  Phase  II  of  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  and  provide  the 
updated ERA including all study reports.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical development of delafloxacin commenced in 2001 with the development of an oral formulation 
up  to  Phase  II  study.  In  2006  a  programme  was  completed  covering  an  oral  and  intravenous  (IV) 
formulation. The aim of the oral formulation development was to achieve in vivo exposure equivalent to 
that of 300 mg delafloxacin IV to allow for switching between these two formulations. Based on the results 
of clinical exposure data, the applicant selected the 450 mg tablet as the to-be-marketed formulation that 
was evaluated in Phase II and Phase III studies in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure 
infections (ABSSSI). 
A total of 23 Phase I studies have been conducted with 14 different formulations of delafloxacin (10 oral 
and 4 IV formulations; see Table 8).

Absorption  
Following IV and oral administration to healthy subjects, delafloxacin is rapidly absorbed with Tmax of 0.75 
– 2 h. The absolute oral bioavailability of the to-be-marketed 450 mg delafloxacin tablet was estimated to 
be 58.8%. 
•  Influence of food 
The influence of food on the bioavailability (BA) of delafloxacin has been evaluated at dosages of  
250 mg and 400 mg of formulation A (neat drug substance in capsule), at 200 mg of formulation B (wet 
granulation capsule), and at 900 mg of the intended commercial tablet formulation (formulation J). Four 
clinical studies (M00-224, M02-422, RX-3341-109, RX-3341-115) demonstrated that administration of 
delafloxacin with food delays absorption (Tmax) and reduces Cmax. The impact of food on the total exposure 
depends  on  the  formulation.  AUC  after  administration  of  900  mg  of  the  intended  commercial  oral 
formulation  was  comparable  when  taken  under  fasted  and  fed  conditions  (geometric  LS  mean  ratio: 
AUC0-t: 101.79, AUC0-∞: 105.0). Cmax of the to-be-marketed tablet formulation was about 20.5% reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 35/123 
 
 
 
 
after a high-fat meal taken prior to administration. Food taken 2 h after dosing did not have any effect on 
the relevant PK parameters. 
•  Bioequivalence 
Study RX-3341-115 
The aim of the oral formulation development was to achieve in vivo exposure equivalent to that of  
300 mg delafloxacin IV to allow for switching between these two formulations. In Part 1 of study  
RX-3341-115 the bioavailability of the to-be-marketed oral formulation (450 mg compressed tablet) and 
IV formulation (300 mg lyophilised Captisol-containing formulation) were compared in healthy subjects. 
This  was  a  single-dose,  open-label,  randomised,  2-period,  2-sequence  study  in  56  healthy  male  and 
female subjects in fasted state. The wash-out time between periods was 7 days. 54 subjects completed 
the study.  
The  overall  exposure  of  delafloxacin  (AUC)  following  administration  of  a  single  450  mg  tablet  was 
bioequivalent to that following 300 mg IV infusion, although both AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were lower after oral 
treatment  (84.5%  and  87.7%,  respectively;  Table  9).  There  was  a  significant  difference  in  Cmax after 
administration of the 450 mg tablet and thus Cmax did not meet bioequivalence criteria (51.5%-59.1%; 
Table 9). Median Tmax of delafloxacin occurred at 0.82 h following the administration of the  
450 mg tablet and at 1 h following 300 mg infused over 1 h. The mean t1/2 of delafloxacin ranged from 
10.90 h to 14.06 h across the two treatments. 
Table 4: Statistical analysis of plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of delafloxacin after 
single oral administration of 450 mg delafloxacin (to-be-marketed tablet; treatment A) and 
IV infusion of 300 mg delafloxacin (to-be-marketed lyophilised Captisol-containing 
formulation; treatment B) over 1 h

Distribution 
Delafloxacin is well distributed with a mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of 30.2 l to  
48.3 l across clinical studies with 300 mg delafloxacin IV (infused over 1 h) which is just below or in the 
range of total body water (~ 42 l). Protein binding in plasma ranged between 71-85%. 
Metabolism 
Metabolism accounts for ≤ 20% of the elimination of delafloxacin with glucuronidation being the primary 
metabolic pathway. Four metabolites of delafloxacin have been designated as M3, M5, M6A, and M7. The 
metabolites  M3  and  M5  have  been  identified  as  ester  glucuronide  metabolites  of  the  parent  drug. 
Metabolite  M6A  has  been  identified  as  an  ether  glucuronide  of  delafloxacin  and  M7  is  an  oxidative 
metabolite.  
In vitro metabolism and pharmacokinetic data suggest that the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A1, 
UG1A3 and UGT2B15 are involved in the glucuronidation of delafloxacin. 
Elimination 
Delafloxacin  is  excreted  in  both  urine  and  faeces.  After  IV  administration  64.5%  and  28.4%  of  the 
administered dose were recovered in urine and faeces, respectively. After oral administration delafloxacin 
was almost equally distributed in urine (50.2%) and faeces (47.7%).  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Simulations were carried out to evaluate dose proportionality (00432-1/PK-3341-009). Based on AUC0-∞, 
the lack of dose proportionality was reported at a dose of 500 mg IV (i.e., the point at which the 90% 
confidence interval is not fully contained within the range of 80-125%). No lack of dose proportionality 
was observed based upon Cmax. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability (IIV) was estimated for almost all PK parameters of the developed population 
PK model (00432-1 / PK-3341-009) for delafloxacin; CLLN (30% CV), CLR (45.9% CV), Vc (38.9% CV), 
Vmax (45.4% CV), Km (60.7% CV), distributional clearance to the peripheral compartment 1 (CLD1, 52.4% 
CV ), volume of distribution for the peripheral compartments 1 and 2 (Vp1 55.8% CV and Vp2 27.5% CV). 
No IIV was found for distributional clearance to the peripheral compartments 2 (CLD2). The model derived 
total exposure based on Bayesian estimates for ABSSSI patients in studies RX-3341-202, RX-3341-302, 
and RX-3341-303 on Day 1 varied from 41.5 µg*h/mL (35.3% CV) to 49.8 (30.9 %CV). Day 3 AUC0-24 
ranged from 31.6 (41.4 %CV) to 52.2 (37.5 %CV). 
Mean day 1 AUC0-24 and Cmax for the ABSSSI patients from study RX-3341-202 (N=75) (report  00242-1) 
were 43.3 µg*h/mL (38.3% CV) and 0.259 µg/mL (71.2% CV), respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
For the IV formulation PK samples were collected in both healthy volunteers and patients. Under the same 
dosing regimen, the overall exposure (AUC) of delafloxacin was comparable between healthy volunteers 
(Phase I studies) and patients with ABSSSI (Phase II and III studies).

For the oral formulation, a PK comparison is not available between healthy volunteers and patients. In the 
Phase  III  study  RX-3341-303  patients  switched  from  300  mg  delafloxacin  IV  twice  daily  to  450  mg 
delafloxacin orally twice daily at Day 4 of treatment. Blood samples for PK analysis were only collected at 
Day 3 of treatment, and thus patient PK data for the oral formulation were not obtained. 
The population PK model was refined using pooled data after IV and PO administration of delafloxacin. 
Data from Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies (i.e. RX3341-104, -108, -110, -111, -114, -115, -116, -118, -202, 
-302, an -303) were used for population PK model development.  The refined model is documented in 
00526-3 (Date: 1st August 2019).    
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Study RX-3341-110 is an open-label, parallel group, single dose, cross-over study in 44 male and female 
subjects to determine if altered renal function affects the plasma pharmacokinetics of delafloxacin. For 
this, the pharmacokinetics of delafloxacin administered as a 400 mg oral dose (formulation A; Table 8) 
and a 300 mg IV infusion (intended commercial formulation) in healthy subjects (eGFR>80 ml/min/1.73 
m2; group A) and subjects with mild (eGFR >50-80 ml/min/1.73 m2; group B), moderate (eGFR >30-50 
ml/min/1.73 m2; group C), and severe renal impairment (eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2; group D) were 
compared. An additional treatment group (E) of subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) received a 
300 mg delafloxacin IV infusion (intended commercial formulation) before and after haemodialysis.  
The  intended  commercial  IV  formulation  of  delafloxacin  contains  2400  mg  Captisol  (sulfobutylether 
β-cyclodextrin; SBECD) per dose to improve drug solubility. In humans, SBECD is eliminated unchanged 
almost entirely by renal filtration, and thus SBECD accumulates in subjects with impaired renal function. 
To  assess  any  potential  effect  of  SBECD  on  delafloxacin  PK,  IV  delafloxacin  (containing  Captisol),  IV 
placebo  containing  Captisol  and  oral  delafloxacin  without  Captisol,  were  administered  to  subjects  in 
groups A-D. The 3 periods were separated by a wash-out-period of 14 days. 
Subjects in group E participated in 2 treatment periods with a wash-out period of 14 days. 
• 
• 
Period 1: 300 mg delafloxacin (containing Captisol) 1 h IV infusion starting approximately 1 h 
before initiation of the last haemodialysis session of the week (E1) 
Period  2:  300  mg  delafloxacin  (containing  Captisol)  1  h  IV  infusion  starting  within  1  h  after 
completion of the last haemodialysis session of the week (E2) 
Results: 
Plasma PK data  
After  300  mg  IV  dosing  or  400  mg  oral  dosing,  the  total  exposure  (AUC)  of  delafloxacin  increased 
consistently as the degree of renal impairment increased.  
For  delafloxacin  IV,  mean  AUC0-t for  the  severe  renal  impairment  group  was  2.1-fold  higher  than  the 
exposure observed for the healthy group. Mean AUC0-t for the ESRD group without haemodialysis after 
dosing (Group E2) was 4.1-fold higher than the exposure observed for the healthy group. Cmax was similar 
for the healthy group and the mild and moderate renal impairment groups. Arithmetic mean Cmax values 
for the severe renal impairment group and for group E2 were 2.1-fold and 6.4-fold higher, respectively, 
than the corresponding value observed for the healthy group (Table 10).  
The elimination half-life (t1/2) was also meaningfully increased only for the severe renal impairment group 
and the ESRD group without haemodialysis after dosing (group E2). Mean t1/2 was 9.3 h for the healthy

group and increased to 15.0 h for the ESRD group without haemodialysis after dosing (group E2) (Table 
10). 
After  the  400-mg  oral  delafloxacin  dose,  the  healthy  group  had  nearly  the  same  total  exposure  as 
observed  following  the  300-mg  delafloxacin/Captisol  IV  dose  (23.64  µg*h/ml  and  25.75  µg*h/ml, 
respectively).  Mean  AUC0-t  values  for  the  moderate  and  severe  renal  impairment  groups  were 
approximately 1.5-fold higher than the corresponding value for the healthy group. Mean Cmax varied little 
across the various renal function groups after oral dosing, with a slightly higher mean Cmax of 7.2 μg/mL 
for the healthy group (Table 10).

It was noted that three PK samples from one individual had to be excluded from the tabulated data since 
deviation was very high (>10-fold higher than the next highest subject’s concentration at these time 
points), probably due to drawing from the infusion line. This explains the very high Cmax mean values for 
ESRD patients reported in the summary statistics.

Statistics  for  plasma  PK  data  of  SBECD  are  shown  in  Table  11.  A  significant  increase  of  total  SBECD 
exposure was observed in the severe renal impairment and ESRD groups compared to the healthy control 
group. Arithmetic mean AUC0-t for the severe renal impairment group was about 5-fold higher than the 
AUC0-t of the healthy group while the increase for the ESRD group without haemodialysis after dosing 
(Group E2) was about 30-fold higher. However, for the healthy group and the mild, moderate, and severe 
renal impairment groups that received both the delafloxacin/Captisol IV infusion and the placebo/Captisol 
IV infusion, the arithmetic mean AUC0-t values appeared to be similar. 
Urine PK data 
After the 300-mg delafloxacin/Captisol IV dosing, the fraction of the delafloxacin dose excreted in urine 
during  48  h  after  dosing  declined  from  45.3%  for  the  healthy  group  to  5.5%  for  the  severe  renal 
impairment group. The vast majority of the urinary excretion of delafloxacin occurred in the first 12 h 
after  dosing.  The  CLcr  decreased  from  6.03  l/h  for  the  healthy  group  to  0.40 l/h  for  the  severe  renal 
impairment group. The CLcr after oral dosing was similar to the values and pattern observed for the IV 
dosing and decreased from 5.09 l/h for the healthy group to 0.29 l/h for the severe renal impairment 
group.  
As expected, CLcr of SBECD decreased with decreasing renal function. Mean CLcr was 5.43 l/h for the 
healthy group and declined to 1.13 l/h for the severe renal impairment group. The mean CLcr of SBECD 
was similar for the delafloxacin/Captisol administration and the placebo/Captisol administration. 
Dialysate PK data 
For  delafloxacin,  when haemodialysis  occurred 1  h after  delafloxacin/Captisol  IV  infusion  in  the  ESRD 
group, the mean fraction of administered delafloxacin recovered in the dialysate (Frem%0-4) was 19.2%. 
Mean CLd was 4.21 l/h.  
For  SBECD,  when  haemodialysis  occurred  1  h  after  the  delafloxacin/Captisol  IV  infusion  in  the  ESRD 
group,  the  mean  fraction of  administered  SBECD  recovered  in  the  dialysate  (Frem%0-4)  was  56.1%. 
Mean CLd was 4.74 L/h. 
PopPK 
The impact of renal impairment, independent of weight or sex indicates that patients with severe renal 
impairment and patients with ESRD are expected to have substantial increases in delafloxacin exposure 
if given the full clinical dose of 300 mg IV Q12h. Simulations were conducted for patients with different 
status  of  renal  impairment  and  reduced  doses  were  proposed  for  severely  renal  impaired  patients 
(00432-1).  With  the  reduced  dose  of  200  mg  IV  Q12h  in  this  patient  population,  simulated  AUC  was 
between AUC values of patients with normal renal functions and those with mildly impaired renal function 
(00432-1). 
Oral administration of 450 mg (report 00517): For the simulated patient population which was generated 
using  bootstrapping  to  reflect  patients  in  Studies  RX-3341-202,  RX-3341-302,  and  RX-3341-303 
(n=3,913), median free-drug and total-drug plasma AUC values on day 1 were 6.43 (min 2.07, max 22.9) 
and  40.2  (min  12.9,  max  143)  mg*h/L,  respectively.  The  median  CLCr  was  95.2  (min  21,  max  244) 
mL/min/1.73 m2. 
00432-2 (PK-3341-015): Patients with normal renal function, mild or moderate impairment received 300 
mg IV Q12h followed by 450 mg PO Q12h while patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease received 200 mg IV Q12h followed by 450 mg PO Q24h delafloxacin. For the simulated patient 
population  which  was  generated  using  bootstrapping  to  reflect  patients  in  studies  RX-3341-202, 
RX-3341-302, and RX-3341-303 (n=3,913), median (min, max) free drug plasma AUC values on Days 1

Delafloxacin was administered to simulated patients with normal renal function, mild and moderate renal 
impairment as 300 mg IV Q12h on Days 1-3 and 450 mg PO Q12h on Day 4. Simulated patients with 
severe renal impairment and ESRD received delafloxacin 200 mg IV Q12h on Days 1 to 3 followed by 450 
mg PO Q12h on Day 4 (00432-2 addendum1 / PK-3341-021). 
Overall, AUC values range roughly from 36 to 57 µg*h/mL (total-drug) and 6 to 9 µg*h/mL (free-drug), 
respectively,  for  patients  with  normal  renal  function  and  mild  or  moderate  impaired  renal  function 
(00517,  00432-2,  and  00432-2  addendum1).  AUC  values  in  patients  with  severe  renal  function  or 
end-stage renal disease tend to rise 2-fold after oral administration of 450 mg Q12h compared to 450 mg 
Q24h (e.g. total AUC 34 to 68 µg*h/mL). 
The impact of dialysis on delafloxacin exposure in patients with end-stage renal disease was quantified by 
adjusting  the  simulated  exposures  in  those  patients  using  the  distribution  ratio  of  AUC0-24  when 
delafloxacin was administered just before and after dialysis in Study RX-3341-110. This study showed 
that AUC0-24 was approximately 20% lower when delafloxacin was administered just before dialysis. 
The refined model (report 00526-1, date: 10 December 2018) reveals that after IV administration of 300 
mg Q12h patients with mild and moderate renal impairment and patients with ESRD receiving a reduced 
IV dose of 200 mg Q12h are expected to have up to about 2-fold higher exposure compared to patients 
with normal renal function (report 00526-1). After oral administration of 450 mg Q12h, patients with mild 
to severe renal impairment and ESRD are expected to have approximately up to 2- to 3.5-fold increase in 
AUC compared to patients with normal renal function (report 00526-1).  
Simulations  were  performed  in  order  to  evaluate  the  differences  in  expected  exposure  (AUC)  when 
delafloxacin  is  administered  with  or  without  dialysis  (report  00526-1).  The  impact  of  dialysis  on 
delafloxacin exposure in patients with ESRD was quantified to be approximately 20% at Day 1 as well as 
at Day 4, following 3 days of delafloxacin Q12h administration. 
In the PoP-PK model, only the renal impairment was identified as the only intrinsic factor warranting dose 
adjustment.  The  other  covariates  such  as age,  gender,  weight  and  disease  status have  not  shown to 
significantly impact delafloxacin exposure.   
Disease status: Disease status (patients vs. healthy) was not a statistically significant predictor of the IIV 
in delafloxacin PK (00432-1). 
Impaired hepatic function 
Study ML-3341-112 was a multi-centre, open-label study to evaluate the PK profile of a single 1-hour 
infusion of 300 mg delafloxacin (intended commercial formulation) in healthy subjects and subjects with 
mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. A total of 39 male and female subjects were enrolled and 
stratified into groups based on hepatic function as defined by the Child-Pugh classification system. 
AUC0-t  in  subjects  with  mild,  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  increased  by  1.1  to  1.4-fold 
compared to healthy subjects. For Cmax either no change (mild impairment) or just a slight reduction (10% 
for moderate impairment and 8% for severe impairment) was observed. 
Drug-Drug-Interactions 
Similar to other fluoroquinolones, delafloxacin is minimally metabolised by CYP450 and undergoes direct 
glucuronidation. Delafloxacin neither inhibits or induces CYP450, nor inhibit drug transporters at clinically 
relevant concentrations.

In in vitro studies, delafloxacin was shown to be a substrate for BCRP (efflux ratio of 8.86) and a possible 
substrate for P-gp (efflux ratio of 2.1). A clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) study to evaluate the in vivo 
DDI potential between delafloxacin and P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors has not been conducted. 
The effect of delafloxacin on midazolam was studied in vivo indicating that delafloxacin is not a CYP3A 
inducer. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Delafloxacin, like other fluoroquinolones, is a novel anionic fluoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits DNA 
synthesis in bacteria by binding to bacterial type II topoisomerases DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. 
Since delafloxacin shows a similar affinity for both types of enzymes, it is depicted as a dual-targeting 
fluoroquinolone. A key feature of delafloxacin is its unique chemical structure among the fluoroquinolone 
class antibiotics. These chemical properties seem to correlate with a highly improved potency relative to 
other fluoroquinolones against Gram-positive bacteria and an enhanced activity in acidic environments. 
Spectrum of antimicrobial activity 
The in vitro activity of delafloxacin against selected clinically prevalent Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
pathogens including anaerobes has been determined via both preclinical profiling studies and surveillance 
studies. 
Delafloxacin was shown to have potent in vitro activity for bacteria traditionally related to ABSSSI such as 
several staphylococci or streptococci. Compared to levofloxacin and other antibiotics delafloxacin had an 
overall  enhanced  activity  against  Gram-positive  isolates.  Additionally,  potent  activity  was  also 
demonstrated against strains with quinolone resistance like MRSA. Delafloxacin was also shown to be 
active  against  Gram-negative  isolates,  although  activity  was  decreased  in  isolates  with  high 
fluoroquinolone-resistance rates.  
The  spectrum  of  activity  of  delafloxacin  also  includes  potent  activity  against  the  atypical  pathogens 
(L. pneumophila, Legionella spp., M. pneumoniae, M. fermentans, M. genitalium; M. hominis, Ureaplasma 
spp., Chlamydophila trachomatis, and  Chlamydophila pneumoniae). Delafloxacin also demonstrates in 
vitro  activity  against  B.  anthracis,  Y.  pestis,  B.  mallei  and  B.  pseudomallei,  bacteria  that  can  cause 
naturally acquired infections but may also be used as biological weapons. 
Bactericidal and intracellular activity / PAE  
In in vitro studies delafloxacin was bactericidal against several staphylococci species including MSSA and 
MRSA strains as well as against other clinical Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates.  
Resistance mechanisms 
Delafloxacin had a low rate of spontaneous mutations leading to resistance in the in vitro  single-step 
mutational studies and a comparable occurrence of resistance development in multiple-steps mutational 
studies with regard to the tested comparator fluoroquinolones. In the clinical studies, no emergence of 
resistance was observed.

Animal studies  
The activity of delafloxacin was evaluated in several infection models against ABSSSI target pathogens 
and other relevant pathogenic bacteria. The data of most importance in this application were those used 
to support the PK/PD analyses. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
The provided studies demonstrated that delafloxacin shows no positive or negative interactions with other 
antibiotics and thus a co-administration with the tested agents is thought to have no impact. Macrolides 
which could be indicated in case of ABSSSI were not tested for antimicrobial interaction to delafloxacin 
due to potential adverse reactions. Furthermore, concomitant administration of both antibiotic classes is 
not recommended for the management of ABSSSI according to current guidelines  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The proposed dose regimen for IV treatment of ABSSSI is 300 mg delafloxacin every 12 hours by 60 
minutes-infusion for 5 to 14 days. It is planned that a switch to the proposed oral dose can be done at the 
discretion of the physician as stated in the product information. 
The proposed oral (PO) treatment of ABSSSI is 450 mg delafloxacin every 12 hours for a total duration of 
5 to 14 days.  
These dose regimens for Phase 2 and 3 studies were selected based on in vitro microbiological testing, in 
vivo  animal  models  of  infection  with  PK/PD  analysis,  target  attainment  analysis  using  MCS,  clinical 
exposure  -response  modelling,  and  clinical  experience.  The  refinement  of  the  popPK  models  and  PTA 
analyses has been achieved in an iterative manner as more human PK data became available from clinical 
studies. 
Non-clinical  PK-PD  targets  for  efficacy  were  determined  using  data  from  a  neutropenic  murine  thigh 
infection model. The AUC/MIC ratio based on free-drug plasma data were found to be the most predictive 
of  efficacy  (r2=0.74  for  S.  aureus).  These  findings  are  in  line  with  PK-PD  relationship  for  other 
fluoroquinolones. 
The free-drug plasma AUC/MIC ratio target associated with net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU reductions 
from baseline for S. aureus were 9.3 and 14.3, respectively.  
Clinical  efficacy-response  relationship  could  not  be  established  due  to  high  percentage  of  successful 
clinical response in clinical efficacy studies. The high percentages of clinical success (improved + cured) 
overall (86.6 to 98.7% across endpoints and populations) and distribution of fAUC24/MIC ratios observed 
relative to the murine non-clinical targets suggest that patients achieved delafloxacin exposures on the 
plateau of the PK/PD relationships for efficacy.  
Based on a refined popPK model (00562-3), MCS were conducted to determine % PTA by MIC values for 
S. aureus on Days 1 and 4 among delafloxacin dose regimens (IV, IV-to-PO, and PO). 
Following the IV dosing regimen of 300 mg delafloxacin IV Q12h for simulated patients with normal renal 
function, mild or moderate renal impairment or 200 mg IV Q12h for patients with severe renal impairment 
or ESRD the percent probabilities of PK/PD target attainment at a MIC value of 0.25 μg/mL based on the 
median fAUC/MIC ratio target associated with net bacterial stasis was nearly 100% on Days 1 and 4 in all 
populations,  respectively.  At  the  MIC  value  of  0.5  μg/mL,  percent  probabilities  of  PK  -  PD  target 
attainment on Days 1 and 4 were 88.4% and 90.7% for the clinical trial population, respectively.

For the IV to PO dosing regimen for delafloxacin (300 mg IV, Q12h on Days 1 to 3 followed by 450 mg PO, 
Q12h on Day 4 [normal renal function and mild/moderate renal impairment] or 200 mg IV, Q12h on Days 
1 to 3 followed by 450 mg PO, Q12h on Day 4 [severe renal impairment or ESRD]), the % PTAs for all 
patients (including those with varying degrees of renal function) on Day 1 and 4 at a MIC90 value of 0.25 
µg/mL associated with net bacterial stasis were 99.8% and 99.7 %, respectively. At a MIC value of 0.5 
μg/mL,  percent  probabilities  of  PK  -  PD  target  attainment  on  Days  1  and  4  were  88.4%  and  82.3%, 
respectively. 
Percent probabilities of target attainment for the oral dosing regimen of 450 mg delafloxacin PO Q12h for 
the clinical trial population (including patients with normal renal function as well as mild/moderate/severe 
renal impairment or patients with ESRD) were 99.5% and 99.7% on Day 1 and 4 at MIC90 value of 0.25 
µg/mL associated with net bacterial stasis, respectively.  
The % PTA for E. coli following IV dosing at stasis which was predicted by simulations was 98% at a MIC 
value of 0.25 µg/mL. For a 1-log10 bacterial reduction, the % PTA was 99% for MICs up to and including 
0.12 μg/mL. 
The % PTA for P. aeruginosa following IV dosing were ≥ 97.3% for stasis (fAUC24/MIC ratio target of 3.81) 
at a MIC value of 1 µg/mL, and 99.9% for 1-log10 CFU reduction (fAUC24/MIC ratio target of 5.02) at a 
MIC value of 0.5 µg/mL. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of delafloxacin as oral and intravenous formulation has 
been well characterised in 23 Phase I studies. 
AUC after administration of 900 mg of the intended commercial oral formulation was comparable when 
taken  under  fasted  and  fed  conditions,  but  a  high-fat  meal  taken  30  min  before  delafloxacin 
administration delayed absorption (Tmax) and reduced Cmax (90% CI: 73.13, 86.44).  
Bioequivalence between the to-be-marketed 450 mg tablet and the to-be-marketed 300 mg IV infusion 
was demonstrated under fasting conditions in terms of AUC. However, both AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were at the 
lower end of the confidence interval after oral administration (mean AUC0-t: 84.5% (CI: 80.90; 88.15), 
mean AUC0-∞: 87.7% (CI: 83.56; 92.00)) and this difference could impact on efficacy when using the oral 
formulation  alone  or  switching  from  IV  to  oral  formulation.  Mean  Cmax  was  about  45%  reduced  after 
administration of the 450 mg tablet under fasting conditions compared to Cmax after intravenous infusion. 
As the PK parameters of IV and oral formulations were not studied in a bioequivalence study under fed 
conditions, a direct comparison of the influence of food on Cmax is not possible. However, the results of 
studies  RX-3341-115  (bioequivalence  study)  and  RX-3341-116  (food  effect  study)  indicate  that  the 
difference in Cmax may be even higher between the two formulations when the 450 mg tablet is taken with 
a meal. Nevertheless, since the relevant PK-PD index of delafloxacin is fAUC24/MIC a decrease in Cmax is 
not expected to affect the probability of target attainment.  
A  population  PK  model  was  developed  describing  data  from  Phase  1,  2,  and  3  studies  after  IV 
administration of delafloxacin and served as basis for various simulations (00432-1 / PK-3341-009). This 
initial model has been updated using pooled data after IV and PO administration. The final model 0526-3 
served as basis for PKPD target attainment analysis.   
In  the  PopPK  model  renal  impairment  was  identified  as  the  only  intrinsic  factor  warranting  dose 
adjustment.  
In  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  mean  AUC0-t was  1.3-fold  and  1.7-fold  higher, 
respectively, compared to healthy subjects. The CHMP agreed that no dose adjustment is required in 
Assessment report

those patients (as reflected in the product information). The safety assessment for patients with mild and 
moderate  renal  impairment  included  in  the  Phase  II  study  RX-3341-201  and  the  Phase  III  studies 
RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 did not identify any additional TEAEs compared to other patients. 
Based on the results from study RX-3341-110 and the popPK analysis the applicant proposed to reduce 
the delafloxacin dose in patients with severe renal impairment (to 200 mg IV every 12 h. Alternatively 
patients should receive 450 mg delafloxacin orally every 12 hours. For delafloxacin IV, mean AUC0-t for 
the severe renal impairment group was 2.1-fold higher than the exposure observed for the healthy group. 
After oral administration of 400 mg delafloxacin in patients with severe renal impairment mean AUC0-t was 
about  1.5-fold  higher  than  the  corresponding  value of  the  healthy  group,  mean Cmax  was  about  25% 
decreased. A dose reduction of the IV formulation for patients with severe renal impairment is therefore 
considered adequate.  
With respect to patients with severe renal impairment, simulated AUCs after dosing with 200 mg 
delafloxacin revealed that exposure will be in the same range as for patients with normal to moderate 
renal function receiving a 300 mg dose. The model used to simulate the exposure underpredicted the 
concentrations in severe renal impairment, resulting in lower predicted AUCs compared to expected 
observed data. But even taking this into account, it is still agreed that exposures after 200 mg dosing IV 
in severe renal impairment will result in exposures in the range of that seen in the clinical trials. 
Differences in Cmax values between renal function groups, associated with safety, were less pronounced. 
The CHMP therefore agreed with the recommendation to reduce the delafloxacin dose in patients with 
severe renal impairment (to 200 mg IV every 12 h and that alternatively patients should receive 450 mg 
delafloxacin orally every 12 hours. 
For the ESRD group without haemodialysis after dosing (Group E2), mean AUC0-t was 4.1-fold higher and 
mean  Cmax  values  for  group  E2  were  6.4-fold  higher  than  the  corresponding  values  observed  for  the 
healthy group. Additionally, the elimination half-life (t1/2) increased from 9.3 h for the healthy group to 15 
h for E2. In order to determine the dose recommendation in patients with ESRD, the CHMP took into 
account data on SBECD exposure. 
Delafloxacin for IV administration is formulated with SBECD which is primarily excreted by glomerular 
filtration  in  the  kidney.  Consistently,  SBECD  exposure  was  shown  to  increase  with  decreased  renal 
function in study RX-3341-110, but SBECD seems not to affect delafloxacin PK. Mean SBECD AUC0-t of 
patient with severe renal impairment was about 5-fold higher, while AUC0-t increased about 30-fold in 
ESRD patients after haemodialysis (group E2). Accumulation of SBECD at supra-clinical concentrations 
has resulted in renal vacuolation and appearance of pulmonary foamy macrophages in animal studies 
(Luke  et  al.,  2010:  review  on  the  basic  and  clinical  pharmacology  of  sulfobutylether-ß-cyclodextrin, J 
Pharm Sci 99: 3291-3301). However, SBECD-associated toxicity in humans that would prevent its use 
has not been described so far. Nevertheless, there are other IV drugs approved that contain SBECD.  
Study RX-3341-110 showed that SBECD is removed from blood by haemodialysis. However, 
haemodialysis is usually performed intermittently (every 2 or 3 days) in ESRD patients and thus SBECD 
is expected to accumulate extensively on interdialytic days which raises a potential safety concern. Based 
on the available data, no dose recommendation for ESRD patients can be supported. In addition, 
predicted exposures of SBECD in ESRD patients were high and clinical safety data in these patients are 
lacking. Therefore, the applicant agreed to not further pursue the recommendation of IV delafloxacin 
dosing in ESRD patients and to modify the product information accordingly. The CHMP considered that the 
dose reduction of 200 mg IV in patients with severe renal impairment remains appropriate and agreed, 
but the risk of renal damage secondary to SBECD accumulation in patients with severe renal impairment 
is seen as an important potential risk necessitating close monitoring and is therefore included in the RMP. 
In in vitro studies, delafloxacin was shown to be a substrate for BCRP and a possible substrate for P-gp. 
However,  a  clinical  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  study  to  evaluate  the  in  vivo  DDI  potential  between

delafloxacin and P-gp and/or BCRP inhibitors has not been conducted. The applicant argues that inhibition 
of these transporters would likely increase delafloxacin Cmax modestly due its good oral bioavailability 
(58.8%),  and  the  increases  in  exposure  would  likely  not  be  clinically  relevant  due  to  the  safety  of 
delafloxacin at oral doses up to 1200 mg/day (study M00-224) and IV doses of 450 mg Q12h (study 
RX-3341-103). This was agreed by the CHMP. In clinical trials 28 patients received a P-gp/BCRP inhibitor 
concomitantly (from start of delafloxacin to EOT). 17 of these patients experienced at least one TAE; 4 of 
them were serious but were not considered to be treatment-related by the applicant. Post-hoc analyses 
indicates that the PK of delafloxacin is not impacted by the presence of P-gp or BCRP inhibitors. 
The  spectrum  of  antimicrobial  activity  has  been  assessed  via  susceptibility  testing  in  both  preclinical 
profiling studies and surveillance studies. Several surveillance studies from different regions in the period 
of 2014 to 2018 were compared and analysed, accordingly. Delafloxacin showed a good activity against 
several gram-positive as well as gram-negative pathogens.  
In vitro experiments were conducted to evaluate the bactericidal effect of delafloxacin and its ability to 
concentrate  inside  cells  with  antibacterial  activity.  The  impact  on  the  proposed  breakpoints  of  the 
post-antibiotic effect and the delayed re-growth of bacteria following exposure to an antibiotic should be 
observed in order to investigate the possibility of resistance development. The CHMP recommended that 
this data should be submitted as a post-authorisation measure by the end of February 2020. 
Concerning  the  testing  of  resistance  mechanisms,  no  resistance  development  was  detected  in  clinical 
studies.  However,  the  development  of  resistance  to  delafloxacin  will  be  monitored  by  the  applicant 
post-authorisation. 
With regard to the aspect of cross-resistance which is commonly observed between fluoroquinolones, a 
summarising comment on cross-resistance of delafloxacin with other antibiotics was implemented in the 
product information.  
The  selection  of  the  IV  dosing  regimen  (300  mg  IV  Q12h)  for  the  clinical  efficacy  studies  has  been 
adequately justified and predicted to be effective via MCS, PK/PD target attainment analysis and a review 
of delafloxacin exposure data obtained from patients enrolled in a Phase 2 ABSSSI study (RX-3341-202). 
The oral dose regimen (450 mg PO Q12h) was selected based on the fact that the 450 mg tablet was 
shown to be bioequivalent to the IV dose. PTA analyses of several oral dosing regimens revealed that a 
dosing  regimen  of  450  mg  PO  Q12h  should  be  sufficiently  effective  in  all  of  the  simulated  patient 
populations even with renal impairment.  
With regard to the evaluation of the PK/PD relationship for efficacy the dosing regimens of IV, IV-to- PO 
and PO only for patients with ABSSSI were evaluated. Based on a popPK model, MCS were conducted to 
determine %PTA by MIC values for S. aureus on Day 1 and 4 among delafloxacin dose regimens (IV, 
IV-to-PO,  and  PO).  Results  of  the  PTA  analyses  for  the  different  dosing  regimens  revealed  sufficient 
coverage (>90%) of the target associated with net bacterial stasis for the different patient populations at 
a MIC representing the clinical breakpoint of 0.25 µg/mL. Thus, the presented data are supportive for the 
proposed  dosing  recommendations.  Therefore,  the  PK/PD  target  attainment  in  simulated  patients 
receiving delafloxacin for all of the proposed dosing regimens are considered acceptable. In the context of 
the exposure-response analysis for clinical endpoints the applicant analysed different efficacy endpoints 
with regard to successful clinical responses. In relation to the primary efficacy endpoint in the pivotal 
trials  (Investigator-assessed  outcome  of  clinical  cure  at  the  FU  visit)  no  relationship  between 
Investigator-assessed clinical response at FU and fAUC/MIC ratio could be identified.  
The applicant has presented a rationale for the proposed MIC interpretive breakpoints and has 
approached EUCAST to set interpretive breakpoints for delafloxacin in the EU. 
The final susceptibility testing breakpoints established by the EUCAST were:

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
With regard to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics the documentation of delafloxacin is considered 
satisfactory.  
Data generated under fasted and fed conditions support the conclusion that delafloxacin can be taken 
with or without food. 
In patients with ESRD, the accumulation of delafloxacin in the two to three days in between two dialysis 
sessions with Q12h dosing still remains unknown but may be pronounced in these patients. No PK data in 
this period are available and model predictions for this period were not possible according to the applicant 
and would be very uncertain given the performance of the model for this subpopulation. Overall, with the 
available data, no dose recommendation for ESRD patients is therefore possible. In addition, predicted 
exposures of SBECD in ESRD patients were high and clinical safety data in these patients are lacking.  
With  respect  to  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment,  simulated  AUCs  after  dosing  with  200  mg  IV 
delafloxacin revealed that exposure will be in the same range as for patients with normal to moderate 
renal  function  receiving  a  300  mg  dose,  even  taking  the  underprediction  by  the  model  for  this 
subpopulation into account. Differences in Cmax values between renal function groups, associated with 
safety, were less pronounced. Regarding the oral formulation, the justification for keeping the 450 mg 
oral dosage in patients with severe renal impairment is supported by popPK model. 
In conclusion, the applicant agreed not to recommend the use of IV and oral delafloxacin dosing in ESRD 
patients in the product information while in patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended IV 
dose is reduced to 200 mg IV every 12 hours. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with severe 
renal impairment for the oral formulation. The risk of renal damage secondary to SBECD accumulation in 
patients with severe renal impairment is seen as an important potential risk necessitating close 
monitoring and is therefore included in the RMP.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Phase 2 study RX-3341-201 
Study RX 3341-201 was a randomised, double blind, Phase II, multicentre study comparing the efficacy 
and safety of IV delafloxacin to that of IV tigecycline when used to treat adults with cSSSI. In total, 150 
patients were randomly assigned, in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, to delafloxacin 300 mg Q12h, delafloxacin 450 mg 
Q12h, or tigecycline 100 mg initially, followed by 50 mg Q12h. Treatment was given for 5 to 14 days, 
based  on  the  investigator’s  judgment.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  clinical  response  in  the  CE 
population at TOC visit (14 to 21 days after the final dose of study drug). Clinical cure was defined as 
resolution  of  baseline  signs  and  symptoms  of  cSSSI  or  improvement  to  an  extent  that  no  additional 
antibiotic treatment is necessary.

The clinical cure rate in CE population was comparable between delafloxacin arms and tigecycline arm. In 
the ITT population the clinical cure rate was numerically higher in the delafloxacin arms compared to the 
tigecycline arm. Regarding safety more AEs were reported for the 450 mg delafloxacin group compared to 
the lower dose. In particular, higher incidences of gastrointestinal disorders (450 mg delafloxacin: 43.1% 
vs. 300 mg delafloxacin: 24.5%) and low serum glucose values (450 mg delafloxacin: n=9 vs. 300 mg 
delafloxacin: n=3) were detected.  
As a conclusion, the 300 mg IV dose of delafloxacin, given its clinical and microbiological effect and its 
tolerability profile, was selected to be evaluated in the next Phase II and larger Phase III studies. 
Overall, the selection of the 300 mg IV dose based on the efficacy and safety results of phase II studies 
seems to be appropriate. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  performed  by  the  applicant.  Study  RX-3341-302  investigated  the 
efficacy of IV delafloxacin vs vancomycin + aztreonam in the treatment of patients with ABSSSI for 5 to 
14  days  (n=  660)  and  was  conducted  in  the  years  2013-2014.  Study  RX-3341-303  investigated  the 
efficacy  of  IV  (3  days)  followed  by  oral  delafloxacin  vs  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  in  the  treatment  of 
patients with ABSSSI for overall 5 to 14 days (n= 850) and was conducted between 2014 and 2016.

Methods  
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
Eligible patients in pivotal studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 were male or female ≥18 years of age 
with a diagnosis of ABSSSI, i.e., an infection involving skin and/or subcutaneous tissues of at least 1 of 
the following 4 types (only the primary infection type was followed for study purposes): 
•  Cellulitis/erysipelas: diffuse skin infection, minimum surface area of 75 cm2 
•  Wound infection: infection characterised by purulent drainage from a traumatic or surgical wound 
with surrounding redness of a minimum surface area of 75 cm2 
•  Major  cutaneous  abscess:  infection  characterised  by  a  collection  of  pus  within  the  dermis  or 
deeper that is accompanied by redness of a minimum surface area of 75 cm2  
•  Burn infection: infection characterised by purulent drainage that is accompanied by redness of a 
minimum surface area of 75 cm2, patients with burn infections were only enrolled if the area of 
the burn comprised ≤10% of the patient’s body surface as determined by the investigator 
AND at least 2 of the following signs of systemic infection: 
• 
Lymph node enlargement due to the present infection 
•  Documented  fever  ≥38°C/100.4°F  taken  orally  (or  the  equivalent  value  for  the  temperature 
recording method used) 
• 
Lymphangitis 
•  Elevated white blood cells (WBCs) of ≥10 000 cells/µL in the 48 hours prior to first dose of study 
drug

Objectives 
In both pivotal trials, the primary endpoint was the investigator's clinical assessment at the FU Visit (i.e., 
Day 14 + 1 from randomisation) with duration of treatment lasting up to 14 days for both delafloxacin and 
the comparator arm. The analysis was performed considering the outcome of cure and of clinical success 
on the ITT and CE populations. 
The TOC visit was timed 14 + 1 day from randomisation. Taking the treatment duration of 5 to 14 days 
into account, the TOC visit was performed between day 0 and day 9 after the last day of treatment. In 
order  to  be  compliant  with  the  addendum  to  the  guideline,  the  applicant  defined  several  additional 
analyses as sensitivity analysis. A new definition of investigator assessment at PTE was introduced within 
a window of 7 - 14 and 6 - 15 days after EOT (PTE7-14 - PTE6-15); all the assessments outside that window 
were considered missing, and therefore counted as failure. If, instead, both the assessments are within 
the defined window after EOT the earliest one (i.e., FU visit) was taken. 
Clinical cure was defined as complete resolution of all baseline signs and symptoms of ABSSSI at EOT, FU, 
and LFU visits; however, if erythema was the only sign of infection remaining at EOT or FU visit, and the 
erythema was absent at LFU visit, then the case was classified as a cure at EOT (derived), FU (derived), 
and LFU visits. 
The primary analysis was performed for the ITT and CE population. The endpoint was prespecified for 
noninferiority testing with a margin of 10%. 
Secondary objectives were as follows:

To evaluate the safety of delafloxacin compared with vancomycin + aztreonam 
Sample size 
In both pivotal studies a sample size of 660 randomly assigned patients (330 per treatment group) was 
calculated  provided  greater  than  90%  power  to  demonstrate  the  noninferiority  of  delafloxacin  with 
respect to the objective response rate of vancomycin + aztreonam with a noninferiority margin of 10%. 
Randomisation 
Patients who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to 
1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio to receive either delafloxacin or vancomycin + aztreonam. 
Randomization was stratified by type of infection and designed so that no more than 25% of enrolled 
patients were treated for a major cutaneous abscess, and no more than 35% (Study RX-3341-302) or 
30%  (Study  RX-3341-303)  of  enrolled  patients  were  treated  for  wound  infections.  The  remaining 
infection types (cellulitis/erysipelas or burn infection) were not limited. Patients who had received 1 dose 
of either a single, potentially effective, short-acting antimicrobial drug or regimen for treatment of the 
ABSSSI  under  study  in  the  14  days  before  study  entry  were  limited  to  no  more  than  25%  of  total 
randomly assigned patients. 
In study RX-3341-303 randomisation was also stratified by baseline BMI (< 30 kg/m2 and ≥ 30 kg/m2). 
Patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 comprised at least 40% but no more than 50% of the enrolled population. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
 
ITT Analysis Set: Includes all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment. Patients were 
grouped and analysed according to their assigned treatment. 
  MITT  Analysis  Set:  Includes  all  patients  in  the  ITT  analysis  set  who  had  a  bacterial  pathogen 
identified at baseline that was known to cause ABSSSI. Patients were analysed according to their 
assigned treatment. 
  CE Analysis Sets: There are several CE analysis sets, each based on the time of assessment. The 
sets include all patients in the ITT analysis set  who had a relevant (at the specific timepoint) 
non-missing assessment, an ABSSSI, who received ≥ 80% of their assigned treatment, had the 
required  clinical  assessments  within  the  appropriate  window,  did  not  receive  systemic 
antibacterial therapy with activity against the causative pathogens through the time period in 
question, and had no protocol deviations that would have affected efficacy assessments through 
the time period in question. Patients were analysed according to their assigned treatment.  
  ME  Analysis  Sets:  There  are  several  ME  analysis  sets,  which  include  all  patients  in  the  MITT 
analysis set who also met the criteria for the corresponding CE analysis set for either objective or 
investigator-assessed response. Patients in the ME analysis sets were analysed according to their 
assigned treatment. 
Primary analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the investigator-assessed response of signs and symptoms of infection 
at  the  Follow-up  Visit.  Levels  of  the  endpoint  were  classified  as  cure,  improved,  success,  failure,  or 
indeterminate.  Indeterminate  responses  were  considered  failures  in  the  ITT  and  MITT  analyses  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019  
Page 55/123 
 
 
 
 
excluded  from  the  CE  and  ME  analysis  sets.  For  all  efficacy  analyses,  patients  were  analysed  in  the 
treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. Patients who received the study drug other than 
the study drug to which they were randomly assigned were not included in the CE and ME analysis sets. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT and the CEFUI analysis sets. 
Cure  rate  was  defined  as  cure  rate=  cure  /  (cure  +  failure),  with  as  improved,  failure,  indeterminate 
(excluded for CEFUI) and missing classified failure. 
The null (H0) and alternative (Ha) hypotheses to be tested in order to establish the non-inferiority of 
delafloxacin were: 
H0: Pd – Pv ≤ -0.10 
Ha: Pd – Pv > -0.10 
where Pv and Pd are the probabilities of the investigator assessed cure for vancomycin + aztreonam and 
delafloxacin, respectively. 
Superiority was tested for secondary hypotheses (H0: Pd – Pv ≤ 0; Ha: Pd – Pv > 0). 
A two-sided 95% CI for non-inferiority testing was computed based on the difference in sample responder 
rates  for  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  and  using  a  non-stratified  method  proposed  by  Miettinen  and 
Nurminen. If the lower limit (LL) of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than -0.10, it was concluded that 
delafloxacin is noninferior to vancomycin + aztreonam. If noninferiority was met superiority was tested. 
If  the  LL  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  is  greater  than  0,  then  delafloxacin  will  be  declared  superior  to 
vancomycin + aztreonam.  
Secondary analyses 
Secondary analyses were performed using non-stratified Miettinen and Nurminen methodology for binary 
endpoints and a mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) analysis for the reduction in pain endpoint. 
Other continuous secondary efficacy measures were analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment, infection type, site of infection, and prior antimicrobial therapy as main effects and 
the  baseline  measure  as  the  covariate.  All  secondary  statistical  tests  and  confidence  intervals  were 
two-sided with a testwise type I error rate at alpha = 0.05. 
Multiplicity 
If the NI of delafloxacin was declared in the primary analysis the secondary endpoints (ITT analysis set or 
for the MEFUI analysis set) were tested for superiority in a hierarchical approach. No interim analysis was 
performed in the studies. 
Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis of the primary endpoint were performed to investigate the 
robustness of the primary efficacy results. 
Subgroups analysis 
An  initial  exploration  of  homogeneity  of  efficacy  across  subgroups  was  undertaken  by  constructing 
two-sided 95% CIs for the treatment groups’ differences in rates of the primary efficacy endpoint, similar 
to  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  using  Miettinen  and  Nurminen  methodology  without  stratification. 
Pre-specified subgroups included demographic stratification (age category, sex, diabetes, BMI groups, 
ethnicity,  race  category  and  region),  baseline  infection  type,  prior  antibiotics  use,  bacteraemia  at 
baseline, quartiles of baseline erythema area, major surgical procedures.

Table 13: Number of Patients With Significant Protocol Deviations, ITT Analysis 
There were an additional 20 patients (10 patients in the delafloxacin treatment group and 10 patients in 
the vancomycin + aztreonam treatment group) who had protocol deviations that impacted evaluability 
but that were not considered significant. These protocol deviations were all related to procedural errors. 
Overall, the occurrence of protocol deviations was balanced across treatment arms for the entire study 
population.

Study drug exposure and days between time points 
Most patients received study drug for 4 to <8 days (study RX-3341-302: delafloxacin group 69.8% vs. 
vancomycin + aztreonam group 73.3%; study RX-3341-303: delafloxacin group 59.9% vs. vancomycin + 
aztreonam  group  61.4%).  In  study  RX-3341-302  less  patients  received  study  drug  for  8  to  14  days 
compared to study RX-3341-303 (RX-3341-302: delafloxacin group 19.1% vs. vancomycin + aztreonam 
group 17.9%; study RX-3341-303: delafloxacin group 35.7% vs. vancomycin + aztreonam group 32%). 
In study RX-3341-302 in 65.9% of the patients the TOC visit (FU visit) was investigated 7 to 14 days after 
EOT. In study RX-3341-303 in 58.6% the TOC visit was performed 7 to 14 days after EOT.

Supportive study 
Phase II study RX-3341-202 
Study RX 3341-202 was a stratified, randomized, double blind, Phase II, multicentre study conducted in 
the US comparing the efficacy and safety of IV delafloxacin to that of IV linezolid and IV vancomycin in the 
treatment of ABSSSI. This study was initiated prior to the release of the current EMA guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections, when the presence of only 
one systemic sign of infection was required to be enrolled. A total of 256 adult patients were randomly 
assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to delafloxacin IV 300 mg Q12h, linezolid IV 600 mg Q12h, or vancomycin IV 
15 mg/kg Q12h. Subjects whose microbiological cultures grew Gram-negative bacteria could have had 
aztreonam added to their treatment regimen at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment was given 
for 5 to 14 days, based on the investigator’s judgment.

Subjects  aged  18  and  above,  who  had  a  diagnosis  of  ABSSSI,  defined  as  cellulitis/erysipelas,  wound 
infection, major cutaneous abscess, or burn infection, of a minimum surface area of 75 cm2; had lymph 
node enlargement caused by the present infection or at least one of the following symptoms of systemic 
infection:  fever  ≥  38°C,  lymphangitis,  white  blood cell  (WBC)  count  ≥  15,000  cells/µL,  or  CRP  >  5.0 
mg/L; and who required and was a suitable candidate for IV antibiotic therapy.  
Randomization was stratified by category of infection with no more than 30% of enrolled subjects having 
cutaneous  abscess.  The  remaining  infection  types  were  not  limited  but  were  stratified  for  balance 
between treatment groups. Randomization was also stratified equally across treatment groups by prior 
antibiotic therapy exclusion criteria, and subjects with prior antibiotic therapy were limited overall to ≤ 
30%. 
Clinical response was determined at Follow-up (Day 14 ± 1) and Late Follow-up (Day 21 to 28) based on 
the  investigator’s  assessment  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  infection.  Microbiological  response  was 
determined  for  subjects  in  the  microbiologically  evaluable  (ME)  population  at  the  Follow-up  and  Late 
Follow-up assessments at both the subject and pathogen levels. 
The investigator assessed outcomes were classified as cure, improved, failure and indeterminate. Cure 
was defined as the complete resolution of all baseline signs and symptoms of ABSSSI at FU and LFU. 
However, if erythema was the only sign of infection remaining at FU, and the erythema was absent at LFU, 
then  the  case  was  classified  as  a  cure. Improved  was  defined  as  some  symptoms  remaining,  but the 
patient  had  improved  to  an  extent  that  no  additional  antibiotic  treatment  was  necessary.  However, 
improved responses were considered failures for purposes of the primary analysis. The primary endpoint, 
clinical response in the ITT population, was determined by the success rate based on the investigator's 
assessment at the Follow-up visit and expressed as (cure) / (cure + failure) in percentage, in which "cure" 
was classified as success, and improved, indeterminate, and failure responses were treated as failures.  
A total of 210 (82.0%) subjects completed the study: 69 (85.2%) in the delafloxacin group, 63 (81.8%) 
in the linezolid group, and 78 (79.6%) in the vancomycin group. Overall, the most frequent reasons for 
withdrawal  were  lost  to  follow-up  (22  [47.8%]  subjects),  other  reasons  (10  [21.7%]  subjects),  and 
subject withdrew consent (9 [19.6%]). Across the 3 treatment groups, demographic characteristics (age, 
sex, ethnicity group, race, height, weight, and BMI) were generally similar. A majority of subjects were 
men (59.4%), Caucasian (76.2%), and not Hispanic or Latino (77.7%). The mean age of subjects was 
43.2 years (range, 18-91 years); and the mean BMI (SD) was 29.5 kg/m2 (6.58). 
At Baseline, 175 of 256 (68.4%) subjects had at least 1 pathogen and 29 of 256 (11.3%) subjects had 
multiple  pathogens.  Among  the  delafloxacin,  linezolid,  and  vancomycin  treatment  groups,  a  similar 
percentage of subjects had at least 1 pathogen at Baseline (63.0%, 74.0%, and 68.4%, respectively); 
whereas a higher percentage of subjects in the linezolid group (19.5% [15 of 77]) had multiple pathogens 
at Baseline than in the delafloxacin (7.4% [6 of 81]) and vancomycin (8.2% [8 of 98]) groups. Overall, 
205  gram-positive  pathogens  (58  in  the  delafloxacin  group,  83  in  the  linezolid  group,  and  74  in  the 
vancomycin group), 6 gram-negative pathogens (4 in the delafloxacin group, 0 in the linezolid group, and 
2 in the vancomycin group), and 3 anaerobes (2 in the delafloxacin group and 1 in the linezolid group) 
were isolated. The most common pathogen was S. aureus (177 isolates: 119 MRSA; 58 MSSA) in all 3 
treatment groups (48 isolates [36 MRSA; 12 MSSA] in the delafloxacin group, 65 isolates [45 MRSA; 20 
MSSA] in the linezolid group, and 64 isolates [38 MRSA; 26 MSSA] in the vancomycin group). Of the 256 
subjects overall, 159 (62.1%) had at least 1 S. aureus pathogen: 106 (41.4%) subjects had at least 1 
MRSA pathogen and 53 (20.7%) subjects had at least 1 MSSA pathogen.

Given  the  statistically  superior  result  in  the  investigator  assessment  of  cure  at  FU  in  the  overall  ITT 
population, subgroups were analysed to assess factors that contributed to this difference. In a post hoc 
analysis, non-obese patients (BMI < 30 kg/m2) showed no statistically significant difference in cure rate 
between  delafloxacin  and  the  other  2  agents.  However,  for  obese  patients  (BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2),  who 
comprised 42% of the study population, the proportion of patients with the investigator assessment of 
cure was significantly higher for delafloxacin (78.8%) than for vancomycin (48.8%; mean difference from 
delafloxacin:  30.0%;  95%  confidence  interval  (CI),  9.3%,  50.7%).  It  was  numerically  higher  for 
delafloxacin compared to linezolid but not statistically different (linezolid outcome 58.8%).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application concerns delafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, for the treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin 
and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI) in adults. The efficacy of delafloxacin was evaluated in two pivotal 
Phase III studies (RX-3341-302 [IV] and RX-3341-303 [IV to oral]) and one supportive Phase II study 
(RX-3341-202 [IV]. 
Design and conduct of pivotal studies 
The  Phase  III  studies  RX-3341-302  and  RX-3341-303  were  multi-centre,  randomized,  double  blind 
efficacy  and  safety  studies  (Study  RX-3341-303  in  addition  double-dummy).  Study  RX-3341-302 
investigated  IV  formulation  of  delafloxacin,  whereas  study  RX-3341-303  investigated  oral  and  IV 
formulation of delafloxacin. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
In both pivotal studies specific definitions of ABSSSI infection types (cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, 
major  cutaneous  abscess,  burn  infection)  with  prespecified  minimum  surface  area  of  75  cm2  and 
definition of at least two of signs of systemic inflammation were included as inclusion criteria to ensure 
that only severely infected patients were included into the studies. 
For burn infections the maximum extent was further specified in the inclusion criteria. Patients with burn 
infections were only enrolled if the area of the burn comprised ≤ 10% of the patient`s body surface as 
determined by the investigator. 
Randomisation was stratified by type of infection and designed so that no more than 25% of enrolled 
patients were treated for a major cutaneous abscess, and no more than 35% (Study RX-3341-302) or 
30%  (Study  RX-3341-303)  of  enrolled  patients  were  treated  for  wound  infections.  The  remaining 
infection types (cellulitis/erysipelas or burn infection) were not limited.  
The exclusion of patients with diabetic foot, which would be considered a complicated infection, is in line 
with  the  recommendation  in  the  Addendum  to  the  guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products 
indicated for treatment of bacterial infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) where diabetic foot infections 
are advised to be evaluated in separate dedicated studies.  
Overall,  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  in  line  with  the  recommendations  in  the  Addendum  and 
therefore acceptable. Patients included on the basis of these criteria meet the requirements for ABSSSI. 
Treatments 
Study RX-3341-302 investigated 300 mg IV delafloxacin every 12 hours for a minimum of 5 days and a 
maximum of 14 days, whereas study RX-3341-303 investigated 300 mg IV delafloxacin every 12 hours 
for 6 doses followed by 450 mg oral delafloxacin, given every 12 hours (without regard to food) for an 
additional 4 to 22 doses with the same treatment duration as in study RX-3341-302 (5-14 days). 
In  both  studies,  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  were  chosen  as  comparator.  Aztreonam  was  added  for 
treatment  of  Gram-negative  ABSSSI  and  was  to  be  stopped  after  baseline  cultures  were  confirmed 
negative for Gram-negative pathogens.  
Vancomycin is a well-established antibiotic that has been used as comparator in several cSSTI studies. 
Even if vancomycin may not be the optimal choice of treatment of MSSA and streptococci and linezolid 
would have been the more appropriate comparator, it is considered acceptable as a high proportion of 
MRSA is aimed at. Weight-based dosage of vancomycin and used dosage of aztreonam are in line with 
approved dosages in the EU.

Primary endpoint  
In both pivotal trials, the primary endpoint was the investigator's clinical assessment at the FU Visit (i.e., 
Day 14 + 1 from randomization) with duration of treatment lasting up to 14 days for both delafloxacin and 
the comparator arm. The analysis was performed considering the outcome of cure and of clinical success 
on the ITT and CE populations. 
According to the Addendum as primary analysis clinical outcome documented at a TOC visit timed from 
randomisation  so  that  it  occurs  within  a  window  of  approximately  7-14  days  after  the  last  day  of 
treatment would be an acceptable primary endpoint. In the pivotal studies the TOC visit was timed 14 + 
1 day from randomisation, which is not in line with this recommendation. Taking the treatment duration 
of 5 to 14 days into account, the TOC visit was performed between day 0 and day 9 after the last day of 
treatment. The applicant addressed this point in its application dossier. In order to be compliant with the 
EMA antibacterial guideline, the applicant defined several additional analyses as sensitivity analysis. A 
new definition of investigator assessment at PTE was introduced within a window of 7 - 14 and 6 - 15 days 
after EOT (PTE7-14 - PTE6-15); all the assessments outside that window were considered missing, and 
therefore counted as failure. If, instead, both the assessments are within the defined window after EOT 
the  earliest  one  (i.e.,  FU  visit)  was  taken.  Overall,  the  used  time  point  of  TOC  visit  is  not  optimal. 
Nevertheless,  since  finally  the  results  of  the  additional  sensitivity  analysis  at  PTE7-14  and  PTE6-15 
supported the results of the primary analysis the approach as used in the pivotal studies is acceptable.  
Clinical cure was defined as complete resolution of all baseline signs and symptoms of ABSSSI at EOT, FU, 
and LFU visits; however, if erythema was the only sign of infection remaining at EOT or FU visit, and the 
erythema was absent at LFU visit, then the case was classified as a cure at EOT (derived), FU (derived), 
and LFU visits. 
Clinical success was defined as a response of cure or improved where the investigator felt that no further 
antibiotics were needed. 
The primary analysis was performed for the ITT and CE population. This is in accordance with current 
recommendations in the antibacterial guideline where it is suggested that the all-treated population and 
the clinically evaluable population should be viewed as co-primary. For the primary efficacy endpoint it is 
further stated that the endpoint was prespecified for non-inferiority testing with a margin of 10%. The 
non-inferiority margin of 10 % is in line with the recommendation in the Addendum to the guideline. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods used for the primary analysis are considered adequate. Non-inferiority of the new 
treatment compared to a comparator treatment was assessed using an appropriate confidence interval 
approach  without  stratification.  The  approach  to  address  multiplicity  is  unproblematic  in  the  pivotal 
studies  with  a  hierarchical  approach  used  for  secondary  endpoints.  There  was  no  multiplicity  due  to 
interim analysis. 
Study protocol amendments and changes to analysis plans are acceptable had no relevant impact on the 
interpretation of results. Missing data is not a major problem in both pivotal studies, 86% to 91% of 
patients completed the studies at clinical follow-up in the study arms of the ITT population (94% to 95% 
in the CEFUI population). The applicant also addressed the problem that patients were excluded from the 
CEFUI  population  if  the  investigator  clinical  assessment  at  follow  up  was  not  available  with  a 
post-treatment  evaluation  analysis.  The  originally  provided  analyses  in  the  clinically  evaluable 
population, conducted as standard “per-protocol” analysis, with varied windowing for the visits for Study 
-303 indicated that delafloxacin cannot be considered non-inferior to the comparator in the study, while 
the ITT analysis allows concluding that delafloxacin is non-inferior to the comparator. As the ITT analysis 
can generally be considered anti-conservative for equivalence or non-inferiority trials it is usually required

that  the  analyses  in  the  “per-protocol”  and  ITT  populations  lead  to  similar  conclusions  for  a  robust 
interpretation of results. The per-protocol set is defined by post randomisation (intercurrent) events and 
may be biased or difficult to interpret. In study -303, there was a larger proportion of patients excluded 
in the vancomycin + aztreonam arm compared to the delafloxacin arm. 
The applicant provided two additional analyses that addressed the issue. The first analysis was performed 
as proposed by the CHMP in form of a sensitivity analysis, evaluating non-inferiority using a principle 
stratum analysis to test the causal treatment effect for patients who would be part of the clinical evaluable 
population  under  both  delafloxacin  and  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  (using  a  “Survivor  Average  Causal 
Effect  (SACE)  as  in  Lou  YL  and  Sun  W,  J  Biopharm  Stat  2018).  The  second  analysis  is  an  additional 
analysis  using  a  hypothetical  strategy  to  impute  excluded  observations  in  the  clinically  evaluable 
population. Results show that for study -303 non-inferiority could be concluded in a range of scenarios in 
the sensitivity analysis and that results are closer to the non-inferiority margin with imputed observations 
compared to the original “per protocol” analysis (although based on the missing at random assumption). 
Results of the analyses also confirm the robustness of the Study -302 results. 
Baseline data 
Baseline data were comparable between treatment arms. In both pivotal studies most patients were aged 
≤ 65 years and Whites. More than half of patients were male. When comparing pivotal studies, in study 
RX 3341-303 more patients were aged >65 years, more patients were from Europe, more patients had a 
BMI ≥ 30 and slightly more patients had diabetes compared to study RX 3341-302. 
The baseline infection type was comparable between delafloxacin and vancomycin + aztreonam groups. 
Less than 30% of patients had a major cutaneous abscess and less than 1% had a burn infection as base 
line infection in delafloxacin and vancomycin + aztreonam groups. In study RX 3341-302 more patients 
with  wound  infection  were  included  into  the  study  compared  to  study  RX  3341-303  (35%  vs.  26%), 
whereas study RX 3341-302 included less patients with cellulitis/erysipelas as base line infection (39% 
vs. 48%).  
Overall,  the  most  common  location  of  the  infection  site  was  the  lower  and  upper  extremities.  The 
distribution  by  anatomical  site  was  similar  between  the  delafloxacin  group  and  the  vancomycin  + 
aztreonam group for sites of infection. 
The  mean  (SD)  size  of  the  erythema,  using  digital  methods,  was  slightly  smaller  in  the  delafloxacin 
treatment groups compared with the vancomycin + aztreonam treatment groups (RX 3341-302: 294.8 
cm2 vs. 319.1 cm2; RX 3341-303: 341.5 cm2 vs. 364.4 cm2). However, there was a wide range in the 
measurements  of  erythema  area.  Similarly,  the  mean  size  of  the  induration,  using  digital  methods, 
tended to be smaller in the delafloxacin treatment group compared with the vancomycin + aztreonam 
treatment group and there was a wide range in the measurements of induration area. 
More  than  55%  of  the  patients  had  3  or  more  systemic  signs  of  infection  in  both  treatment  groups. 
Overall, the most frequent systemic sign reported was lymph node enlargement due to present infection 
with similar numbers between the 2 treatment groups. The other frequently reported systemic sign was 
the  presence  of  purulent  or  seropurulent  drainage  or  discharge  with  similar  numbers  between  the  2 
treatment groups. Approximately half of the patients had the systemic sign of elevated white blood cell 
(WBC) ≥ 10,000 cells/µL. Overall, fewer than 50% of the patients reported the systemic sign of elevated 
C reactive protein, fever ≥ 38ºC/100.4ºF, lymphangitis, or bacteraemia. 
Overall,  baseline  disease  characteristics  are  in  line  with  the  recommendation  in  the  Addendum  and 
severity of disease was supported by baseline data.

In study RX-3341-302 in 65.9% of the patients the TOC visit (FU visit) was investigated 8 to 14 days after 
EOT (as recommended in the Addendum). In study RX-3341-303 in 58.6% the TOC visit was performed 
8 to 14 days after EOT.  
The percentage of patients who had the FU visit within 3 days and within 6 days from EOT was higher in 
the study RX-3341-303 versus study RX-3341-302 (i.e.: 17.8% vs 11.4% within 3 days and 40.2% vs 
25.6% within 6 days, respectively); however, there was no difference in the distribution of patients by 
treatment arm. 
The pathogens isolated at baseline reflected the most commonly detected causal pathogens for ABSSSI. 
Baseline pathogens were in general comparable between treatment groups.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses of pivotal studies 
Primary EP 
Study RX 3341-302 (delafloxacin IV):  
In the ITT population the cure rate at FU visit was 52.0% in the delafloxacin group and 50.5% in the 
vancomycin + aztreonam group. In the CE population (CEFUI) the cure rates at FU visit were comparable 
as  well  (delafloxacin  59.2%  vs.  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  58.2%).  The  cure  rates  are  relatively  low 
compared to some other studies in ABSSSI. However, this could be explained by early time point of FU 
visit  and  strict  definition  of  clinical  cure  (complete  resolution  of  all  baseline  signs  and  symptoms  of 
ABSSSI at FU). Non-inferiority of delafloxacin to vancomycin + aztreonam has been demonstrated, since 
the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval was above the pre-specified margin -10% for the 
primary endpoint in both the ITT (-6.1%) and CE (-7.8%) population. 
The success rates (cure + improved where the investigator felt that no further antibiotics were needed in 
the respective populations) in the ITT population at FU were 81.6% in the delafloxacin group an 83.2% in 
the vancomycin + aztreonam group (95% CI -7.6, 4.1). In the CE-Population the success rates were 
97.1% in the delafloxacin group and 97.5% in the vancomycin + aztreonam group (95% CI -3.7, 2.7). 
The reasons for clinical failure at FU visit were generally well balanced between treatment groups in the 
study.  
Cure rates at FU visit in the MITT and ME population as well as cure rates in the ITT and CE population at 
PTE, PTE7-14 and PTE6-15 were comparable between delafloxacin and vancomycin + aztreonam group. 
The results of these sensitivity analyses support the results of the primary analysis.  
Study RX 3341-303 (delafloxacin IV 6 doses followed by oral): 
The cure rates at FU visit in the ITT population were 57.7% in the delafloxacin group and 59.7% in the 
vancomycin + aztreonam group, which were slightly higher rates compared to study RX 3341-302. For 
the ITT population the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval was above the pre-specified 
margin -10% (-8.6%). 
In the CE population (CEFUI) the cure rates at FU visit were 62.3% (delafloxacin) vs. 68.1% (vancomycin 
+ aztreonam), 95% CI -12.9, 1.4. The lower limit of the 95% CI was below the non-inferiority (NI) margin 
(-10%).  
The success rates (cure + improved where the investigator felt that no further antibiotics were needed in 
the respective populations) in the ITT population at FU were 87.2% in the delafloxacin group an 84.8% in 
the vancomycin + aztreonam group (95% CI –2.2, 7.2). In the CE-Population the success rates were 
96.3% in the delafloxacin group and 97.0% in the vancomycin + aztreonam group (95% CI -3.5, 2.2).

The reasons for clinical failure at FU visit were generally well balanced between treatment groups in the 
study.  
The cure rates in the MITT population (all patients in the ITT analysis set who had a bacterial pathogen 
identified  at  baseline  that  was  known  to  cause  ABSSSI)  were  comparable  (delafloxacin  57.5%  vs. 
vancomycin + aztreonam 58.8% (95% CI -9.6, 6.8). However, in the ME population (all patients in the 
MITT  analysis  set  who  also  met  the  criteria  for  the  CE  analysis  set  for  either  objective  or 
investigator-assessed response) the cure rate in the delafloxacin group was slightly lower compared to 
vancomycin + aztreonam group (61.0% vs. 67.9%, 95% CI -15.7, 2.1), which are in line with the results 
of the cure rates in the CE population.  
In addition, in the ITT population the cure rates at PTE, PTE7-14 and PTE6-15 were comparable between 
delafloxacin and vancomycin + aztreonam group. However, in the CE population the cure rates at PTE, 
PTE7-14  and  PTE6-15  tended  to  be  in  disfavour  of  delafloxacin.  Overall,  these  sensitivity  analyses 
supported that non-inferiority can be concluded for the ITT population; however, non-inferiority could not 
formally be concluded for the CE population.  
The applicant was requested to further discuss possible implications of the early TOC visit on the results 
of the primary analysis. It was quantified how many patients had the FU assessment outside the window 
of 7 - 14 days after EOT, and in particular, how many patients had an earlier time of FU assessment which 
has been categorised as FU at < 3 days from EOT and < 6 days from EOT and of early TOC visit on the 
results of the primary analysis. The percentage of patients who had the FU visit within 3 days and within 
6 days from EOT was higher in the study RX-3341-303 versus study RX-3341-302 (i.e.: 17.8% vs 11.4% 
within 3 days and 40.2% vs 25.6% within 6 days, respectively); however, there was no difference in the 
distribution of patients by treatment arm. 
Furthermore, shift tables of clinical assessment from FU to LFU for patients with FU visit < 3 and ≤6 days 
from EOT were provided. In the vast majority of cases the investigator’s assessment at FU < 3 days and 
≤6 days from EOT was confirmed at the subsequent LFU visit. 
Considering the FU assessment ≤ 3 days from EOT, only two patients per each treatment arm in study 
RX-3341-302, and 14 and 11 patients in the delafloxacin and vancomycin arm in study RX-3341-303, 
respectively, were evaluated at the earlier assessment as improved whereas the outcome could have 
potentially been assessed as cure if the TOC was performed later, being cure recorded at the LFU. 
However, only one patient allocated to vancomycin in each pivotal study was assessed as cure at this 
much earlier assessment, while at later FU visit the response was de-escalated to improved. Finally, in 
study RX-3341-302 only one patient on delafloxacin and one patient on vancomycin treatment arm had 
the earlier assessment (improved and cure, respectively) without any confirmatory later assessment. 
Regarding the FU assessment ≤6 days from EOT, similar results were obtained for the evaluation of the 
impact of early assessments on the clinical response. A total of 22 and 45 patients in RX-3341-302 study 
and in RX-3341-03 study respectively, similarly distributed between the treatment arms, were evaluated 
at the earlier assessment as improved whereas the outcome could have potentially been recorded as cure 
if the TOC was performed later. The number of patients who have been assessed as cured at FU and then 
de-escalated to improved at LFU was negligible in both studies.  
Overall, the analysis supported that the FU assessment performed earlier than the window of 7 - 14 days 
after the EOT had a negligible effect on the evaluation of the primary endpoint in both pivotal studies.  
Results of two additional analysis showed that for study -303 non-inferiority could be concluded in a range 
of  scenarios  in  the  sensitivity  analysis  and  that  results  are  closer  to  the  non-inferiority  margin  with 
imputed observations compared to the original “per protocol” analysis (although based on the missing at 
random assumption). Results of the analyses also confirmed the robustness of the Study -302 results.

Furthermore, additional analysis supported that no relationship between exposure and clinical response 
could be identified. In addition, no relevant differences of the predicted plasma exposures (measured at 
day 1 and day 3 after IV delafloxacin) in those who did and did not fail between studies RX-3341-302 and 
RX-3341-303 were detectable. 
Subgroup analyses in studies RX 3341-302 and RX 3341-303 
Eradication rates as presented by the applicant were in general high and comparable between treatment 
groups. Eradication rates of delafloxacin for MRSA were 100% (58/58) in study RX 3341-302 and 96% 
(48/50) in study RX 3341-303.  
In both studies cure rates were considerably higher at FU visit in patients in Europe (study RX 3341-302: 
delafloxacin 85.7%, vancomycin + aztreonam 70.9%, n=118; study RX 3341-303: delafloxacin 67.9%, 
vancomycin + aztreonam 69.9%; n=338) compared to North America (study RX 3341-302: delafloxacin 
44.0%, vancomycin + aztreonam 46.4%, n=542; study RX 3341-303: delafloxacin 46.5%, vancomycin 
+ aztreonam 49.5%; n=398).  
In  study  RX  3341-302  cure  rate  at  FU  visit  in  women  was  considerably  higher  in  delafloxacin  group 
(58.4%)  compared  to  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  (47.5%).  In  men  cure  rates  were  slightly  lower  in 
delafloxacin  group  (48.1%  vs.  52.2%).  In  study  RX  3341-303  cure  rate  at  FU  visit  in  women  was 
comparable between treatment groups. In men the cure rate was slightly lower in the delafloxacin group 
(54.6% vs. 58.7%). In both studies cure rates at FU visit were considerably higher in women compared 
to men. 
In study RX 3341-302 the cure rate at FU visit in patients with renal impairment (CLcr < 90 mL/min) was 
higher in the delafloxacin group (delafloxacin 60.4% (n=53); vancomycin + aztreonam 52.7% (n=55)), 
whereas in study RX 3341-303 the cure rates were comparable (delafloxacin 68.1% (n=69); vancomycin 
+  aztreonam  68.7%  (n=67)).  In  addition,  the  number  of  patients  with  different  degree  of  renal 
impairment in pivotal studies and respective cure rates was provided. Overall, 167 patients with mild 
renal impairment (CLcr≥60 mL/min and CLcr < 90 mL/min), 75 patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CLcr  ≥30  mL/min  and  CLcr  <  60  mL/min)  and  four patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  (CLcr  <  30 
mL/min) were included in the pivotal studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303. In the Phase III pool cure 
rates  in  the  delafloxacin  group  were  numerically  higher  in  patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal 
impairment compared to cure rate in patients with normal renal function. When comparing delafloxacin 
group  and  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  group,  the  cure  rate  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  was 
comparable  and  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment,  the  cure  rate  was  numerically  higher in 
delafloxacin  group.  Since  only  four  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  included  into  pivotal 
studies, no conclusion about efficacy in this population is possible. Overall, efficacy of delafloxacin in mild 
and moderate renal impaired patients seems to be adequate. The data available in patients with severe 
renal impairment is too limited to draw a conclusion regarding efficacy. 
Cure rates at FU visit in patients with cellulitis/erysipelas were higher in delafloxacin group compared to 
comparator group in study RX 3341-302 (delafloxacin: 67.2% n=128; vancomycin + aztreonam: 60.9% 
n=128), whereas in study RX 3341-303 cure rates at FU visit were slightly lower in delafloxacin group 
compared to comparator group (delafloxacin 59.9% n=202 vs. vancomycin + aztreonam 63.1% n=202). 
In  patients  with  major  abscess  cure  rates  at  FU  visit  were  higher  in  delafloxacin  group  compared  to 
vancomycin + aztreonam group in both pivotal studies (study RX 3341-302: delafloxacin 52.4% n=84; 
vancomycin + aztreonam 48.2% n=83; study RX 3341-303: delafloxacin 64.2% n=106; vancomycin + 
aztreonam 57.5% n=106). 
In contrast, in case of wound infection cure rates were considerably lower in delafloxacin group compared 
to comparator group in both pivotal studies (study RX 3341-302: delafloxacin 33.6% n=116; vancomycin 
+ aztreonam 41.4% n=116; study RX 3341-303: delafloxacin 46.8% n=111; vancomycin + aztreonam 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 86/123 
 
 
  
54.5% n=112). However, further analysis indicated that a different treatment effect for the cure rate in 
patients with wound infection could not be statistically claimed. Furthermore, it was highlighted that in 
terms of success rate (cured or improved) the differences at FU between treatment arms in patients with 
wound infection were negligible in the RX-3341-302 study and the rate of success was even higher in 
patients  treated  with  delafloxacin  in  the  RX-3341-303  study.  In  addition,  the  cure  rates  in  patients 
treated with delafloxacin were also similar to those in patients treated with vancomycin + aztreonam 
when the analysis considered the assessment at the LFU. 
Phase  II  study  RX  3341-202  was  investigated  to  evaluate  efficacy  and  safety  of  delafloxacin  (IV) 
compared to treatment with IV linezolid or IV vancomycin in patients with ABSSSI. In comparison with 
pivotal studies in study RX 3341-202 the presence of only one systemic sign of infection was necessary to 
be enrolled. However, further analysis indicated that in this Phase II study in a substantial proportion of 
patients two or more systemic signs of infection were detectable which suggest that a sufficiently ill study 
population was investigated. 
The TOC visit was performed on day 14 ± 1 after initiation of treatment, which relates to day 0-9 after 
EOT. Definition of cure was acceptable.  
In general, baseline characteristics were comparable. There were small differences in mean age. In the 
delafloxacin group mean age was 39.7 years, whereas in linezolid group mean age was 44.8 years and in 
the vancomycin group the mean age was 44.8 years. Regarding the baseline infection slightly more cases 
of  wound  infection  compared  to  comparator  groups  were  detectable  (delafloxacin  48.1%,  linezolid 
41.6%,  vancomycin  44.9%).  Furthermore,  the  total  area  of  infection  was  slightly  smaller  in  the 
delafloxacin group. Baseline pathogens were as expected for ABSSSI. 
Cure  rates  at  TOC  visit  (ITT  population)  were  numerically  higher  in  the  delafloxacin  group  (70.4%) 
compared to linezolid group (64.9%) and significantly higher compared to vancomycin group (54.1%). 
Overall, it can be concluded that results of phase II study RX 3341-202 support efficacy of delafloxacin IV 
in patients with ABSSSI. 
Surveillance studies to monitor the susceptibility of representative clinical isolates against delafloxacin 
were  conducted  between  2014-2017  in  the  EU  (including  Israel)  and  USA,  as  part  of  the  SENTRY 
Antimicrobial  Surveillance  Program  in  which  the  activity  of  delafloxacin  is  compared  to  numerous 
broad-spectrum  agents  when  tested  against  contemporary  clinical  isolates  collected  in  European  and 
United States medical centres. 
Delafloxacin is depicted as a dual-targeting fluoroquinolone showing similar affinity to the bacterial type 
II topoisomerases DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and thus might exhibit an advantageous resistance 
profile compared to other fluoroquinolones. Thus, the conduct of surveillance studies as a statutory 
requirement to determine if resistance to delafloxacin has developed in target organisms specific to the 
indication in the label for ABSSSI is regarded necessary. Accordingly, the applicant confirmed that all data 
on resistance surveillance retrieved from SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and future 
surveillance programs will be presented and discussed in future PSURs in the context of efficacy. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In  study  RX-3341-302  non-inferiority  of  delafloxacin  (IV)  has  been  demonstrated  (which  was  further 
supported by results of phase 2 study RX 3341-202). 
In  study  RX-3341-303  (IV  followed  by  oral  delafloxacin),  non-inferiority  of  delafloxacin  towards 
vancomycin + aztreonam for the primary endpoint clinical cure at FU visit has only been demonstrated for 
the ITT population. In the CE population the lower limit of the 95% CI was below the non-inferiority (NI) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 87/123 
 
 
  
margin (-10%) which was further supported by sensitivity analysis. The CHMP considered it acceptable to 
consider the single primary population ITT (all randomised patients) for primary analysis and to regard 
the CE population as secondary. 
In study RX-3341-303 the success rates (cure + improved where the investigator felt that no further 
antibiotics were needed in the respective populations) at FU visit were comparable between treatment 
groups  in  both  the  ITT  and  CE  population.  Furthermore,  non-inferiority  of  delafloxacin  towards 
vancomycin + aztreonam for the endpoint success at FU visit has been demonstrated for both the ITT and 
CE population. 
Furthermore, the applicant provided two additional analyses where results showed that for study -303 
non-inferiority could be concluded in a range of scenarios in the sensitivity analysis and that results are 
closer to the non-inferiority margin with imputed observations compared to the original “per protocol” 
analysis (although based on the missing at random assumption).  
In addition, no relevant differences of the predicted plasma exposures (measured on day 1 and day 3 
after IV delafloxacin) in those who did and did not fail between studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 
were detectable which support the conclusion of non-inferiority. 
Overall, non-inferiority of IV as well as IV followed by oral delafloxacin is concluded. 
Development  of  resistance  is  regarded  as  efficacy  concern  and  should  be  closely  monitored  during 
post-marketing period. Any information that becomes available to the applicant on emerging resistance, 
changing patterns of resistance or new mechanisms of resistance to the antibacterial agent should be 
notified  promptly  to  EU  regulators  with  a  discussion  of  the  possible  implications  for  the  product 
information. The applicant should follow up and report this issue in the Periodic Safety Update Reports. In 
this  regard,  the  applicant  confirmed  that  all  data  on  resistance  surveillance  retrieved  from  SENTRY 
Antimicrobial Surveillance Program and future surveillance programs will be presented and discussed in 
future PSURs in the context of efficacy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Delafloxacin has been evaluated in 30 completed Phase I to Phase III clinical studies comprising a total of 
2658  delafloxacin-treated  subjects.  Safety  data  from  the  delafloxacin  clinical  program  have  been 
assessed using the following analysis sets: 
• 
• 
Integrated Phase I Safety analysis set (including 20 Phase I studies)  
Phase II and III Safety Pooled Analysis Set (including two Phase II and two Phase III studies: 
RX-3341-201,  RX-3341-202,  RX-3341-302  and  RX-3341-303;  includes  1840  subjects  with 
ABSSSI who received delafloxacin or comparator, of these 868 patients who received multiple 
doses of delafloxacin 300 mg IV/ 450 mg oral delafloxacin Q12h) 
• 
Non-integrated studies (three studies evaluated delafloxacin in indications AECB (M01-298), CAP 
(M01-344) and urogenital gonorrhoea (ML-3341-304) in doses that were not used in the ABSSSI 
studies, one Phase I study in subjects with renal impairment (RX-3341-110), one Phase I study in 
subjects  with  hepatic  impairment  (ML-3341-112)  and  one  Phase  I  drug  interaction  study 
(ML-3341-118) with midazolam). Additionally, one Phase II study (RX-3341-201) included in the 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set also enrolled 51 subjects who received 450 mg IV delafloxacin 
Q12h for 5 to 14 days. The data from these subjects are not included in the pooled analysis set 
since the 450 mg IV dose provides higher exposure than the to-be-marketed 300 mg IV dose.

Phase I Safety Analysis Set 
In the Phase I Safety Analysis Set, a total number of 340 TEAEs were reported for delafloxacin. Out of the 
814  subjects  included  in  the  20  studies  in  the  Phase  I  Safety  Analysis  Set,  no  deaths  or  SAEs  were 
reported.  One  subject  had  a  severe  TEAE  (dysphagia)  which  was  assessed  as  unrelated  to  the  study 
treatment  by  the  investigator.  42.5%  of  subjects  experienced  any  TEAE  and  30.6%  of  subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019

experienced a treatment-related TEAE which were all of mild or moderate severity. In 1.5% of cases, 
TEAEs lead to premature study drug discontinuation and 1.4% of cases were treatment-related.  
By SOC, the most commonly reported TEAEs were related to SOC gastrointestinal tract, nervous system 
disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (IV  formulation).  By  preferred  term,  the  most  commonly 
reported TEAEs (i.e., incidence of ≥ 5% in combined doses and regimens) were the following: diarrhoea 
(13.3%), nausea (10.2%), headache (9.3%), vomiting (4.4%), dizziness (3.9%) and infusion site pain 
(3.7%;  IV  formulation).  The  integrated  data  suggest  a  higher  frequency  of  gastrointestinal  and 
infusion-related (with IV dosing) TEAEs at higher doses. During the clinical development program, 10 oral 
formulations  of  delafloxacin  have  been  studied,  in  part  to  mitigate  gastrointestinal  events,  and  4  IV 
formulations have been studied. The incidence of diarrhoea (7.6%) and nausea (7.8%) and headache 
(3.2%) reported in pooled Phase III studies were reduced with the improved formulations. 
TEAEs related to study drug 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
The table below presents TEAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in pooled phase 
II and phase III studies and Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set, which occurred in ≥ 2% of patients in

TEAEs by severity 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
The overall incidence of moderate TEAEs was 16.5% due to a higher incidence in the phase II studies 
(26.0%) compared to phase III studies (14.8%). Severe TEAEs were documented in < 4% of patients in 
either group. Most of severe TEAEs were also categorised as serious adverse events (SAEs). Patients with 
SAEs are discussed in section 4.4. Mostly, serious TEAEs were not related to delafloxacin treatment. The 
most  common  severe  TEAEs  in  the  delafloxacin  group  in  Phase  II  and  III  Safety  Analysis  Set  were 
infections and infestations (2.0%). 
AEs of special interest (AESIs) 
AESIs were selected based on medical issues of interest for the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics such 
as  follows:  C.  difficile  diarrhoea,  dysglycaemia,  potential  hepatic-related  events,  potential  QT 
prolongation,  potential  seizures,  potential  myopathy,  potential  neuropathy,  potential  tendon  disorder, 
potential phototoxicity and potential allergic reaction.

0.9%,  potential  peripheral  neuropathy  in  0.9%,  potential  QT  prolongation  in  0.4%,  and  C.  difficile 
diarrhoea in 0.1%. Few subjects (2.7%) had AESI that were considered to be treatment-related by the 
investigator, i.e. potential allergic reactions (1.6%), hepatic related events (0.7%), C. difficile diarrhoea 
(0.1%), potential myopathy (0.1%) and potential QT prolongation (0.1%). 
AESIs lasting longer than 30 days 
In  the  Phase  II  and  III  Safety  Analysis  Set  AESIs  with  longer  than  30  days  duration  occurred  in  the 
categories hepatic events, dysglycaemia, potential peripheral neuropathy, potential myopathy, potential 
tendon disorder, potential allergic reactions and potential phototoxicity. 
In the Phase I Safety Analysis Set, four subjects had an AESI lasting longer than 30 days: 2 with rash 
(potential  allergic  reaction),  1  with  C.  difficile  colitis,  and  1  with  blood  creatinine  increased  (potential 
myopathy).

Phase II data 
Study report of RX-3341-201 states that low serum glucose values were observed in 1 tigecycline treated 
patient and 11 delafloxacin-treated patients (9 patients in the 450 mg delafloxacin group and 3 patients 
in  the  300  mg  delafloxacin  group).  Only  1  patient  in  the  450  mg  group  reported  an  AE  of  true 
hypoglycaemia.  Since  the  450mg  IV  delafloxacin  treatment  arm  was  excluded  from  phase  II  and  II 
integrated data set, this event is not listed in the phase II data pool table.  
AESIs related to study drug 
Rates of treatment-related hyperglycaemia (0.3% and 0.4%) and hypoglycaemia (0.1% and 0.2%) were 
similar between patients in the delafloxacin and comparator groups, respectively. No major differences in 
the incidence of dysglycaemia-related preferred terms were detected. 
Potential neuromuscular and convulsion events 
Potential myopathy 
Rates of events for potential myopathy were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group versus comparator 
group  (2.1%  and  3.9%,  respectively).  The  term  potential  myopathy  included  renal  failure,  which 
contributed  to  the  higher  rate  in  the  comparator  group  due  to  vancomycin  nephrotoxicity.  Rates  of 
potential myopathy lasting longer than 30 days were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group versus 
comparator group (0.6% and 1.2%, respectively [data not shown]). These events were mild or moderate 
in  severity  and  non-serious.  No  treatment  discontinuations  or  SAEs  were  attributed  to  myopathy  in 
patients treated with delafloxacin 
Potential neuropathy 
Rates of events for potential peripheral neuropathy were similar between patients in the delafloxacin and 
comparator  groups  (0.6%  and  0.7%,  respectively).  Rates  of  potential  peripheral  neuropathy  lasting 
longer than 30 days were similar between patients in the delafloxacin and comparator groups (0.1% and

0.3%, respectively [data not shown]). These events were mild or moderate in severity and non-serious. 
No treatment discontinuations or SAEs were attributed to peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with 
delafloxacin. 
Potential tendon disorder 
Rates of potential tendon disorder were similar between the delafloxacin and comparator groups (0.3% 
and 0.1%, respectively). No cases of tendon rupture were reported. Rates of potential tendon disorder 
lasting longer than 30 days were similar between the delafloxacin and comparator groups (0.2% and 
0.1%,  respectively).  These  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  and  non-serious.  No  treatment 
discontinuations or SAEs were attributed to tendon disorders in patients treated with delafloxacin.  
Potential seizures 
Rates of convulsions were the same between patients in the delafloxacin and comparator groups (0.1% in 
both treatment groups). No patients in either treatment group had convulsions lasting longer than 30 
days (data not shown). There were no premature discontinuations from delafloxacin due to an event of 
convulsions.  Case  narratives  with  comprehensive  causality  assessment  of  patients  experiencing 
convulsions and potential seizure events including syncope were provided for the three patients included 
in  Phase  II  studies  who  experienced  events  of  convulsion/potential  seizure  or  syncope,  two  of  them 
possibly related to delafloxacin use. 
AESIs related to study drug 
Rates of treatment-related potential myopathy were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group versus 
comparator  group  (1.0%  and  2.4%,  respectively).  Rates  of  treatment-related  potential  peripheral 
neuropathy were similar between patients in the delafloxacin and comparator groups (0.2% and 0.3%, 
respectively). No patients in either treatment group had treatment-related potential tendon disorder. One 
patient  in  the  comparator  group  had  treatment-related  convulsions  compared  with  no  patients  in  the 
delafloxacin group.

AESIs related to study drug 
Rates of treatment-related potential allergic reactions were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group 
versus  comparator  group  (1.3%  and  3.5%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  urticaria,  dermatitis,  and 
hypersensitivity was higher in pooled phase III compared to pooled phase II. In contrast, in pooled phase 
II the incidences of pustular rash and rash were higher than in pooled phase III.  
Potential QT prolongation 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
Three patients (0.3%) in the delafloxacin group had events for potential QT prolongation (preferred term: 
syncope)  compared  with  1  patient  (0.1%)  in  the  comparator  group  (preferred  term:  loss  of 
consciousness).  No  patients  in  either  treatment  group  had  an  event  lasting  longer  than  30  days.  No 
treatment discontinuations or SAEs were attributed to potential QT prolongation in patients treated with 
delafloxacin. Baseline electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected and only repeated as clinically necessary. 
No follow-up ECGs were performed for cause. 
AESIs related to study drug 
The  events  in  the  delafloxacin  group  were  considered  unrelated  to  treatment,  while  the  event  in  the 
comparator  group  was  considered  related  to  treatment.  The  individual  case  reports  for  all  events  of 
potential  QT  prolongation in  the  delafloxacin  group were  provided  and  critically  discussed  in  terms  of 
underlying  concomitant  disease,  concomitant  drug  medications  and  potential  relation  to  delafloxacin 
treatment.  Three  cases  of  syncope  were  classified  as  ‘potential  QT  prolongation  based  on  the 
Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs). The investigator did not consider them as due to QT prolongation 
and as such did not consider ECGs necessary. Patient narratives were provided with plausible causality 
assessment and the events of syncope were considered unrelated to delafloxacin. 
Phase I Cardiac Safety Studies M01-365 and RX-3341-111 
As part of the ongoing cardiovascular assessment, 2 detailed evaluations of the effect of delafloxacin on 
the QT interval have been conducted: M01-365 and RX-3341-111. Delafloxacin did not have an effect on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019

the QTcF interval, nor was there any evidence of a significant effect on atrioventricular conduction or 
cardiac depolarisation as measured by the PR and QRS interval durations. 
C. difficile diarrhoea 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
Two  patients  (0.2%)  in  the  delafloxacin  group  had  C.  difficile  diarrhoea  compared  with  none  in  the 
comparator group, i.e. patient 840 363 3931 and patient 203 0030 from RX 3341-303 and RX-3341-201, 
respectively).  Patient  840-363-3931  entered  the  study  as  a  prior  treatment  failure  with  previous 
treatment  with  Bactrim  (sulfamethoxazole  /  trimethoprim)  and  clindamycin.  Neither  patient  had  C. 
difficile diarrhoea lasting longer than 30 days (data not shown). In both patients, the events of diarrhoea 
were considered related to treatment and of mild severity. No treatment discontinuations or SAEs were 
attributed to C. difficile diarrhoea in patients treated with delafloxacin.  
AESIs related to study drug 
Both events of C. difficile diarrhoea in RX-3341-303 and RX-3341-201 were considered at least possibly 
related to delafloxacin treatment. Case narratives were provided for both patients.  
Potential phototoxicity 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
One patient (0.1%) in the 300 mg delafloxacin group experienced an event of potential phototoxicity 
(RX-3341-201, Patient 201-215-0005) compared with none in the comparator group. The event lasted 
longer than 30 days (data not shown). Because this event onset was 11 days after the end of treatment 
in a patient who worked outdoors in construction, the investigator considered it unrelated to treatment. 
No treatment discontinuations or SAEs were attributed to phototoxicity events in patients treated with 
delafloxacin. 
Phase I Phototoxicity Study M01-284 
Delafloxacin’s potential for photosensitivity was evaluated in M01-284. Delafloxacin failed to 
demonstrate a significant phototoxic effect at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. In particular, the 
classical pattern of fluoroquinolone phototoxicity as detected in previous phototoxicity studies (i.e., an 
ultraviolet A (UVA) phenomenon maximal at 24 h) was not seen.  
AESIs related to study drug 
In RX-3341-201, the one case report of potential phototoxicity in patient 201-215-0005 was considered 
unrelated to delafloxacin-treatment. 
Serious adverse event and deaths 
Deaths 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
There were a total of 4 TEAEs leading to death, 1 in the delafloxacin group (septic shock [RX-3341-302]) 
and  3 
in  the  comparator  group  (myocardial 
infarction  [RX-3341-303]; 
intestinal 
ischemia 
[RX-3341-303]; and pulmonary embolism [RX-3341-302], all of which were unrelated to treatment. 
In RX-3341-302, Patient #376 081 0724, an 89-year old male was treated with delafloxacin for 14 days 
for cellulitis of the left leg; a causative pathogen was not identified. The patient had a complicated medical 
history including diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, placement of a cardiac assist device, cerebrovascular 
accident,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  chronic  renal  failure,  congestive  heart  failure,  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019

myocardial  ischemia.  He  had  signs of  systemic  infection  at  baseline.  The patient  was  discharged to  a 
rehabilitation institute after 14 days of treatment with delafloxacin and assessed as failure. There is no 
record of any discharge antibiotics given after end of study treatment. The patient returned to the hospital 
5 days after the last dose of delafloxacin. The patient died on the same day following cellulitis and sepsis 
leading to septic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest in the setting of ischemic heart disease and atrial 
fibrillation assessed as unrelated to study treatment by the investigator. 
Pooled Phase 1 studies and non-integrated studies 
No deaths were reported in the pooled Phase 1 studies or in the non-integrated studies. 
Serious adverse events 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
The  incidence  of  SAEs  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  (3.7%  with  delafloxacin  and  3.8%  with 
comparators).  The  most  common  system  organ  class  of  events  was  infections  /  infestations  (2.2%) 
followed  by  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (0.5%),  injury  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications (0.3%), psychiatric disorders (0.2%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.2%). 
Events of more than 1 report in the delafloxacin group include cellulitis (4 patients), skin infection (4 
patients),  infection  (2  patients),  and  pulmonary  embolism  (2  events).  The  majority  of  events  were 
considered unrelated to treatment. Six patients were assessed as having SAEs related to treatment, 2 
delafloxacin  patients  (1  patient  with  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase 
(AST) increased and 1 patient with urticaria), and 4 comparator treated patients (2 patients with renal 
failure, 1 patient with acute renal failure, and 1 patient with rash). 
Phase I Safety Analysis Set 
No serious treatment - emergent adverse events were reported in the pooled Phase 1 studies.

kg/m2  or  ≥  30  kg/m2),  diabetic/not  diabetic,  renal  function,  history  of  hepatitis).  Regarding  intrinsic 
factors,  no  major  safety  signals  were  obvious  regarding  age,  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  BMI,  having 
diabetes, or a history of hepatitis (as assessed by the SOC and preferred terms of TEAE regardless of the 
treatment causality).  
Age 
The majority of patients in the analysis set were ≤ 65 years (N=759 in the delafloxacin group). In the 
pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, 26.7% (203 / 759) of patients ≤ 65 years of age experienced TEAEs 
that were considered to be delafloxacin-related compared to 17.4% (19 / 109) of patients treated with 
delafloxacin who were > 65 years of age. The majority of TEAEs recorded were mild in intensity. The 
incidence of moderate and severe TEAEs was rather comparable between patients ≤ and > 65 years of 
age. In the group of subjects ≤ 65 years, 28 patients (3.7%) experienced a serious TEAEs out of which 1 
was considered related to delafloxacin treatment. Similarly, 4 patients (3.7%) and 1 treatment-related 
case were reported in subjects > 65 years. The incidence of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation 
was similar in both age groups (1.6% versus 1.8%) whereas the incidence of related TEAEs was slightly 
lower in subjects ≤ 65 years (N= 4; 0.5%) compared to subjects >65 years (N=2; 1.8%). AESIs were 
equally reported in both age groups (11.1% versus 11.0%, respectively). 
Gender 
In the pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, 23.5% (126 / 536) of male patients and 28.9% (96 / 332) 
of  female  patients  treated  with  delafloxacin  reported  TEAEs  that  were  considered  to  be  drug  related. 
TEAEs presented by maximum intensity were mostly mild and equally distributed between both genders. 
Similarly, for both genders 1 case of serious TEAE was reported. The incidences of TEAEs leading to study 
drug discontinuation, related TEAE leading to premature study drug discontinuation and AESIs were low 
and comparable between both genders.

The  majority  of  patients  in  the  analysis  set  were  White  (N  =  736  patients  in  the  delafloxacin  group) 
followed by Black or African American, (N = 54 patients). Of these White patients, 26.2% (193 patients) 
reported treatment-related AEs. Black or African American patients treated with vancomycin experienced 
treatment-related  TEAEs  at  a  higher  rate  (41.9%  (31  /  74  patients))  compared  to  those in  the  same 
subgroup treated with delafloxacin (24.1% (13 / 54 patients)). The incidences of related serious TEAEs, 
TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation,  related  TEAE  leading  to  premature  study  drug 
discontinuation and AESIs were low and comparable between races. The numbers of patients in the other 
race subgroups (American Indian or Alaska native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or 
“Other”) were insufficient to provide meaningful comparisons between the delafloxacin and comparator 
arms. 
Body mass index category 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
In the pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, 125 / 497 (25.2%) of patients with BMI < 30 kg/m2 reported 
treatment - related TEAEs compared to 97 / 371 (26.1%) of patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 treated with 
delafloxacin. About 40% of patients in the treated population in the Phase III ABSSSI studies were obese 
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Two subjects (0.5%) with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 experienced a delafloxacin-related serious 
TEAE whereas no patients with BMI < 30 kg/m2. The TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, related 
TEAE leading to premature study drug discontinuation and AESIs were low and comparable between both 
groups. One patient with BMI < 30 kg/m2 died in the delafloxacin group. Assessment of this single case 
is provided in section 4.4.1. 
RX-3341-302 
For patients with BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥30 kg/m2, lower percentages of patients experienced TEAEs 
in  the  delafloxacin  treatment  group  than  in  the  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  treatment  group.  For  the 
delafloxacin treatment group, the incidences of TEAEs were similar between patients with BMI <30 kg/m2 
(45.6%  [94  of  206])  and  patients  with  BMI  ≥30  kg/m2  (50.8%  [60  of  118]).  For  the  vancomycin  + 
aztreonam treatment group, the incidences of TEAEs were similar between patients with BMI <30 kg/m2 
(58.8% [137 of 233]) and patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (60.2% [56 of 93]). 
Additionally, in obese subjects, a lower percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group compared with 
the vancomycin + aztreonam group experienced TEAEs related to study drug (27.1% vs 32.3%), TEAEs 
of  special  interest  (11.0%  vs  21.5%),  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  study  drug  discontinuation  (0  vs 
3.2%), and TEAEs related to study drug and leading to premature study drug discontinuation (0 vs 2.2%). 
A slightly higher percentage of subjects in the delafloxacin group than in the vancomycin + aztreonam 
group  experienced  TEAEs  assessed  as  moderate  or  severe  in  intensity  (21.2%  vs  19.4%).  In  obese 
subjects, 1 subject (in the vancomycin + aztreonam group) had an SAE leading to death.  
There  were  no  clear  differences  in  haematology  or  chemistry  outcomes  between  delafloxacin  and 
vancomycin and no evidence of major dysglycaemias with either drug. 
RX-3341-303 
No comprehensive safety evaluation for delafloxacin in patients with BMI <30 kg/m2 and BMI ≥30 kg/m2 
was provided.  
Diabetes 
In the pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, 15 / 93 (16.1%) patients with diabetes reported treatment 
- related TEAEs compared to 207/775 (26.7%) of non - diabetic patients treated with delafloxacin. For the 
subgroup of patients with diabetes, treatment - related TEAEs were more common in the comparator

group versus the delafloxacin group. Two (0.3%) non-diabetic patients experienced a delafloxacin-related 
serious TEAE whereas no patients in the diabetic group. Similarly, no diabetic patient experienced TEAEs 
leading to study drug discontinuation and related TEAE leading to premature study drug discontinuation 
compared to 14 (1.8%) and 6 (0.8%) respectively of non-diabetic patients. 
Renal impairment 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
Patients with mild to moderate renal impairment were eligible for inclusion in RX-3341-201, RX-3341-202 
and RX-3341-302, and patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment were eligible for inclusion 
in RX-3341-303. 
A total of 139 (16%) patients treated with delafloxacin had creatinine clearance < 90 mL/min at baseline. 
In the pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, 32 (23.0%) patients with creatinine clearance < 90 mL/min 
treated with delafloxacin reported treatment - related TEAEs. No serious treatment-related TEAEs were 
reported for renal impaired patients. The incidences of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation and 
related  TEAE  leading  to  premature  study  drug  discontinuation  were  low  (3  [2.2%]  and  1  [0.7%] 
respectively. 
Phase  I  Study  RX-3341-110:  Effect  of  Renal  Impairment  on  the  Safety  of  Oral  and  IV 
Delafloxacin, IV Captisol, and IV Placebo 
RX-3341-110  was  an  open-label,  placebo-controlled  single  daily  oral  and  IV  dose  study  designed  to 
assess  the  pharmacokinetics  of  delafloxacin  in  normal  healthy  subjects  and  in  subjects  with  mild, 
moderate, and severe renal disease. In a crossover study design, subjects received single oral doses of 
400 mg, single 300 mg IV infusions formulated in Captisol, as well as a single 1 h IV infusion of Captisol 
placebo.  An  additional  treatment  group  included  subjects  with  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD)  who 
received  a  300  mg  delafloxacin  IV  infusion  approximately  1  h  prior  to  initiation  of  dialysis  and,  on  a 
subsequent haemodialysis session, a 300 mg delafloxacin infusion approximately 1 h after the completion 
of dialysis. 
A total of 44 subjects were assessed for safety. Overall, 28 of 44 (63.6%) reported 1 or more TEAEs. The 
most  common  TEAEs  reported  included  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  fatigue,  headache,  dizziness, 
hypoglycaemia, and pruritus. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 2 of 9 subjects (22.2%) in the 
healthy group, 5 of 8 subjects (62.5%) in the mild renal impairment group, 3 of 8 subjects (37.5%) in the 
moderate renal impairment group, and 5 of 9 subjects (55.6%) in the severe renal impairment group 
after the 300-mg delafloxacin/Captisol IV infusion. For the ESRD group, TEAEs were reported by 8 of 10 
subjects  (80.0%)  when  the  300-mg  delafloxacin/Captisol  IV  infusion  was  administered  1  hour  before 
haemodialysis  and  by  7  of  10  subjects  (70.0%)  when  administered  1  hour  after  haemodialysis.  In 
subjects who reported treatment-related TEAEs, the majority had TEAEs that were considered possibly 
(22.7%) or probably (15.9%) related to study drug. With the exception of 31 moderate TEAEs and 1 
severe  TEAE,  all  TEAEs  were  of  mild  severity.  Two  subjects  (4.5%)  were  discontinued  due  to  TEAEs. 
Subject  0001102  (healthy  group)  was  discontinued  due  to  a  severe,  unrelated  TEAE  of  Clostridium 
difficile  colitis  and  Subject  0001406  (severe  renal  impairment  group)  was  discontinued  due  to  a 
moderate, unrelated TEAE of musculoskeletal pain in the left shoulder. There were no deaths, SAEs, or 
other  AEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation.  Overall,  there  were  no  apparent  treatment-related  trends 
observed  in  the  clinical  laboratory  assessments,  vital  sign  measurements,  ECG  results,  or  physical 
examination findings. 
Hepatic impairment 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 105/123 
 
 
  
 
A total of 233 (27%) patients treated with delafloxacin had a history of infectious hepatitis. In the pooled 
Phase  II  and  Phase  III  studies,  68  (29.2%)  patients  with  hepatitis  B  or  C  in  the  delafloxacin  group 
reported  treatment  -  related  TEAEs.  Three  subjects  (1.3%)  experienced  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug 
discontinuation.  No  cases  of  related  serious  TEAEs,  related  TEAE  leading  to  premature  study  drug 
discontinuation and death were reported for patients with history of infectious hepatitis.  
Phase I Study ML-3341-112: Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the Safety of IV Delafloxacin 
ML-3341-112 was a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, single-dose, pharmacokinetic study. A total of 40 
subjects were stratified into groups based on hepatic function as defined by the Child Pugh classification 
system. All subjects received a single 1 h IV infusion of 300 mg delafloxacin. 
A total of 39 subjects were assessed for safety. Overall, 11 TEAEs were reported and 10 of 39 subjects 
(25.6%) reported at least 1 TEAE. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported by 1 of 7 subjects (14.3%) in 
the  mild  hepatic  impairment  group,  no  subjects  in  the  moderate  hepatic  impairment  group,  2  of  6 
subjects (33.3%) in the severe hepatic impairment group, and 7 of 20 subjects (35.0%) overall in the 
healthy  subjects group  (3  of  7  subjects  [42.9%]  in the  mild hepatic impairment  match  group,  3 of  7 
subjects [42.9%] in the moderate hepatic impairment match group, and 1 of 6 subjects [16.7%] in the 
severe  hepatic  impairment  match  group).  In  subjects  who  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs,  the 
majority reported TEAEs that were considered probably (7.7%) to study drug or possibly (5.1%) related 
to study drug. With the exception of 2 moderate TEAEs, all TEAEs were of mild severity. Moderate TEAEs 
reported included headache and drug hypersensitivity. Three subjects (7.7%) were discontinued due to 
TEAEs. Subject 1101 (mild hepatic impairment group) was discontinued due to a mild, probably related 
TEAE of drug hypersensitivity, Subject 1113 (healthy subject, mild hepatic impairment match group) was 
discontinued  due  to  a  mild,  possibly  related  TEAE  of  presyncope,  and  Subject  2211  (healthy  subject, 
moderate hepatic impairment match group) was discontinued due to a moderate, probably related TEAE 
of drug hypersensitivity. All TEAEs resolved by the end of the study. 
No  deaths  or  SAEs  were  reported  in  this  study.  There  were  no  apparent  treatment-related  trends  or 
clinically significant findings observed in the clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, 
ECG results, or physical examination findings. 
Immunological events 
Potential  allergic  reaction  was  considered  an  adverse  event  of  special  interest  and  3  premature 
discontinuations  from  delafloxacin  were  reported  (2  patients  with  urticaria,  1  patient  with  allergic 
dermatitis). One patient in the delafloxacin group experienced a treatment-related SAE of urticaria. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Phase I Study ML-3341-118: Effect of Repeated Oral Doses of Delafloxacin Co-administered 
with a Single Oral Dose of Midazolam on Safety in Healthy Subjects 
ML-3341-118  was  a  Phase  I,  non-randomized,  open-label  study  designed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of 
repeated  oral  doses  of  delafloxacin  on  the  PK  profile  of  a  single  oral  dose  of  midazolam  in  healthy 
subjects. Twenty-two male and female subjects received a single 5 mg oral dose of midazolam on Day 1, 
oral delafloxacin (450 mg) twice-daily (Q12h) doses on Days 3 to 8, and co administered a single 5 mg 
oral dose of midazolam in the morning on Day 8.  
A total of 22 subjects were assessed for safety. A total of 5 subjects (22.7%) reported at least 1 TEAE; 1 
subject (4.5%) after receiving midazolam alone, 4 subjects (18.2%) after receiving delafloxacin alone, 
and no subjects after receiving midazolam co administered with delafloxacin. In subjects who reported

TEAEs, the majority had TEAEs that were considered probably related to study drug (3 subjects, 13.6%), 
which were reported after administration of delafloxacin alone. All TEAEs were mild in severity. The most 
frequently  reported  TEAE  overall  was  diarrhoea  (3  subjects,  13.6%).  All  events  of  diarrhoea  were 
reported  after  administration  of  delafloxacin  alone,  were  mild,  and  did  not  lead  to  treatment 
discontinuation. The single TEAE reported after administration of midazolam alone was headache, which 
was considered not related to study drug by the investigator. There were no deaths, serious AEs, or TEAEs 
leading  to  study  discontinuation.  All  TEAEs  resolved  by  the  end  of  the  study.  With  the  exception  of 
increased  blood  creatinine  in  1  subject,  there  were  no  clinically  significant  findings  noted  or  TEAEs 
reported resulting from clinical laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, physical examination 
findings, or ECG results. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set 
Fewer  patients  had  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  study  drug  discontinuation  in  the  delafloxacin  group 
versus the comparator group (1.6% and 3.8%, respectively). Most of study drug discontinuations were 
reported in phase III studies (13 [1.8%]) compared to phase II studies (1 [0.8%]. Events of more than 
1 report in the delafloxacin group include urticaria (2 patients) and hypersensitivity (2 patients). Fewer 
patients  had  treatment  -  related  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  study  drug  discontinuation  in  the 
delafloxacin group versus the comparator group (6 (0.7%) and 23 (2.4%) patients, respectively). In the 
delafloxacin  group  treatment-related  TEAEs  leading  to  premature  study  drug  discontinuation  were 
urticaria (2 [0.2%]), hypersensitivity (2 [0.2%]), dermatitis allergic (1 [0.1%]) and vomiting (1 [0.1%]). 
In  the  phase  II  studies  only  one  case  of  bacteraemia  and  one  of  pyrexia  occurred  whereas  all  other 
treatment discontinuations were counted in phase III studies. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety Database 
Delafloxacin has been evaluated in 30 completed Phase I to Phase III clinical studies comprising a total of 
2658 delafloxacin-treated subjects. The Phase I Safety analysis set included 814 subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of IV or oral delafloxacin in 20 completed Phase I single or multiple dose regimen studies with 
different formulations. The Phase II and III Safety Analysis set included 1840 subjects with ABSSSI who 
received delafloxacin or comparator, 868 of whom received multiple doses of delafloxacin in the 300 mg 
IV / 450 mg oral delafloxacin Q12h treatment arms in 4 controlled Phase II and III studies (RX-3341-201, 
RX-3341-202,  RX-3341-302  and  RX-3341-303).  Moreover,  additional  safety  data  was  provided  from 
Non-integrated studies (3 Phase I, 2 Phase II and 1 Phase III) and six phase I studies performed in special 
populations.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  in  the  integrated  studies  as  well  as  in  the  single  pivotal 
studies  ranged  from  4.6  days  to  7.3  days.  Overall,  the  size  of  safety  database  can  be  regarded  as 
sufficient to evaluate the safety of delafloxacin in patients with ABSSSI. 
Adverse events 
The CHMP noted that for other fluoroquinolones, the indication cSSTI/ABSSSI is restricted to second/last 
line indication based on evaluated risks. In order to evaluate the first line indication initially claimed by the 
applicant,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  safety  profile  of  delafloxacin  based  on  the  data  submitted  by  the 
applicant, literature data and the product information of other fluoroquinolones, in the absence of direct 
in vivo comparisons between delafloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. 
Common adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 107/123 
 
 
  
In the Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set a total number of 868 subjects were treated with delafloxacin 
and experienced an absolute number of 1008 TEAEs. The most common TEAEs in the delafloxacin group 
were  nausea  (9.1%),  diarrhoea  (8.6%),  infection  (5.2%),  infusion  site  extravasation  (4.7%),  and 
headache  (3.5%).  Notably,  the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  was  higher  in  the  delafloxacin  group  (8.6%) 
compared  to  the  comparator  (3.9%)  whereas  the  other  SOCs  were  rather  comparable  between  both 
groups. Overall, the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders for delafloxacin was higher in the Phase II and 
III Safety Analysis Set (16.5%) compared to the pooled phase III study data (14.4%) due to higher rates 
in Phase II studies. A higher frequency of GI disorders appears to occur at higher doses of delafloxacin. 
Use of a suboptimal formulation and higher than the selected ready-to-market dose of delafloxacin in 
Phase II studies was the likely cause for the higher frequency of gastrointestinal disorders observed in 
Phase II studies. The incidences of gastrointestinal disorders were comparable between the two pivotal 
studies. Additional data were provided for TEAEs and ADRs with incidence ≤ 2% or 5% in phase II and III 
Safety Analysis Set and both pivotal studies and showed no major discrepancies. 
Relationship, Severity and Time to Onset of TEAEs 
The  TEAEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  Safety 
Analysis Set were largely in concordance with the overall reported TEAEs. As expected, gastrointestinal 
TEAEs dominated. The most common severe TEAEs in the delafloxacin group in Phase II and III Safety 
Analysis Set were infections and infestations (2.0%). Additional data were provided for treatment-related 
TEAEs with incidence ≤ 2% or 5% in phase II and III Safety Analysis Set and both pivotal studies. Onset 
of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea within the first 5 days was similar for delafloxacin and comparators in 
the pooled analysis. Individual data for the onset of these gastrointestinal events in study RX-3341-303 
with respect to switch from intravenous to oral therapy as well as time to onset data for both Phase III 
studies were provided. The increase in the incidence in overall GI events was mostly due to an increase in 
the incidence in diarrhoea which might be caused by switching from IV formulation to oral but also by the 
cumulative dose administered. 
Adverse events of special interest 
In  general,  some  rare  or  very  rare  adverse  events  know  to  be  associated  with  the  class  of 
fluoroquinolones such as psychiatric disorders. All TEAEs and ADRs that were reported for delafloxacin 
and comparator arms were provided for the individual Phase III studies and the Phase II and III safety 
pool.  Based  on the  limited  size  of  the  safety  database,  it  is not possible to detect  rare  and  very  rare 
events. Therefore, the possibility of these class effects cannot be excluded for delafloxacin. 
Different headings were used to count events of potential seizure including syncope which may also be 
used to evaluate cardiovascular events. The respective term was re-evaluated in the context of system 
organ class. The applicant specified the preferred term syncope based on underlying cause and adjusted 
tabular  calculations  for  potential  QT  prolongation  and  potential  seizures.  Case  narratives  for  patients 
experiencing syncope were provided and supported the re-categorisation all three of these events under 
‘potential QT prolongation’. No event was considered as ‘potential for seizure’. 
The CHMP noted that for other fluoroquinolones, the indication cSSTI/ABSSSI is restricted to second/last 
line indication based on evaluated risks. In order to evaluate the first line indication initially claimed by the 
applicant,  the  CHMP  reviewed  the  safety  profile  of  delafloxacin  based  on  the  data  submitted  by  the 
applicant, literature data and the product information of other fluoroquinolones, in the absence of direct 
in vivo comparisons between delafloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. 
Based on preclinical data, a potentially favourable safety profile of delafloxacin was anticipated regarding 
cardiac  effects  (including  QT  prolongation),  hepatotoxicity,  CNS  effects,  and  based  on  Phase  I  data 
phototoxicity.  Some  data  suggest  a  possible  safety  benefit  of  delafloxacin  compared  to  other 
fluoroquinolones, in particular for QT prolongation phototoxicity. Some favourable trends were observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 108/123 
 
 
  
also  for  nervous  system  disorders,  psychiatric  effects,  and  potentially  blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders. However, for other ADRs, delafloxacin showed a trend to a less favourable safety profile, e.g. 
in the gastrointestinal disorder SOC. 
Rates  of  treatment  -  related  hepatic  events  were  similar  between  patients  in  the  delafloxacin  and 
comparator groups. The incidence of hepatic-related TEAEs for delafloxacin was comparable to those of 
moxifloxacin and levofloxacin as reported in the originator SmPC’s. In addition, the applicant has provided 
published  data  for  moxifloxacin  and  compared  those  to  delafloxacin  and  vancomycin  +  aztreonam, 
respectively. A comparison regarding hepatitis as well as acute and severe liver injury remains difficult 
given that these events are rare and very rare for moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. As such, the comparison 
is based mostly on transaminase elevations and increases in hepatic enzymes which seem to occur with 
similar frequency for moxifloxacin and levofloxacin. Since the occurrence of increased liver parameters as 
well as infectious hepatitis is common in this patient group, the assessment of the impact of delafloxacin 
itself on the liver is hampered. This concern also applies to the comparator group, since hepatobiliary 
disorders are not listed in section 4.8 for vancomycin following latest Article 31 referral. The applicant 
presented an overview on patient demographic with history of drug and/or alcohol abuse and analysed 
the occurrence of hepatic-related TEAEs in the delafloxacin group and vancomycin + aztreonam group, 
respectively. Considering the high number of drug and alcohol abusive patients included in the Phase III 
studies, confounding of hepatic-related ADRs remains a possibility. However, no significant safety signals 
in drug/alcohol abusive patients compared to non-abusers were apparent in the Phase II and III Pool. 
Upon assessment of an additional comparison of ADR frequencies in patients with and without hepatic 
impairment  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  safety  pool  and  between  individual  Phase  III  studies  in  order  to 
evaluate hepatic effects of delafloxacin, the CHMP considered that overall, the safety of delafloxacin in 
patients  with  hepatic  impairment  compared  to  patients  without  hepatic  impairment  appears  to  be 
comparable, without need for dose adjustment. 
Rates  of  treatment-related  hyperglycaemia  and  hypoglycaemia  were  similar  between  patients  in  the 
delafloxacin and comparator groups. Compared to other approved fluoroquinolones and given the limited 
size  of  the  delafloxacin  safety  database,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  delafloxacin  can  favour 
dysglycaemias.  Regarding  diabetic  patients,  the  safety  profile  of  delafloxacin  appears  to  be  similar  in 
diabetic and not diabetic patients. The case narrative of one diabetic patient who experienced an event of 
borderline hypoglycaemia was provided and considered unrelated to delafloxacin. 
Rates of treatment-related potential myopathy were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group versus 
comparator group (1.0% and 2.4%, respectively). Overall, the incidences of myopathy-related preferred 
terms  were  lower  for  delafloxacin  compared  to  comparators.  Rates  of  treatment-related  potential 
peripheral neuropathy were similar between patients in the delafloxacin and comparator groups. The total 
number and incidence of delafloxacin-related paraesthesia was higher in pooled Phase III than in pooled 
phase II studies and the comparator groups. Case narratives for patients experiencing paraesthesia were 
provided. Overall, the potential of delafloxacin to induce peripheral neuropathy cannot be excluded. 
Three cases of potential tendinopathy were reported in the RX-3341-303 study, but no patients in either 
treatment group were considered to have treatment-related potential tendon disorder.  
One patient in study RX-3341-302 had a possibly treatment-related event of convulsions compared with 
no and one in study RX-3341-201. Case narratives were provided. Based on the available data it cannot 
be fully excluded that delafloxacin may have lowered the seizure threshold in these patients further. 
The incidence of treatment-related renal impairment was higher for delafloxacin than for the comparator 
and  few  cases  of  renal  failure  were  reported.  The  applicant  clarified  that  none  of  the  cases  of 
treatment-related “CPK increase” were reported together with renal impairment / failure. Case narratives 
of patients with treatment-related CPK increase and of patients with renal impairment/renal failure were 
provided.

Rates of treatment-related potential allergic reactions were lower in patients in the delafloxacin group 
versus comparator group. The incidence of urticaria, dermatitis, and hypersensitivity was higher in pooled 
phase III compared to pooled phase II. In contrast, in pooled phase II the incidences of pustular rash and 
rash were higher than in pooled phase III. There were three premature discontinuations from delafloxacin 
due to an event of potential allergic reaction (2 patients with urticaria, 1 patient with allergic dermatitis). 
One  delafloxacin-treated  patient  experienced 
the  SAE  of  urticaria  which  was  considered 
treatment-related. Compared to other approved fluoroquinolones, it cannot be ruled out that delafloxacin 
can favour urticarial, rash, dermatitis and hypersensitivity. Additional data for pruritus, rash and urticarial 
were  provided.  The  number  of  patients  with  overall  pruritus,  rash  and  urticaria  was  higher  in 
RX-3341-302 study than in RX-3341-303 study (7.8% vs 4.3%, respectively), this was also the case 
considering each term separately. When considered separately, pruritus, rash and urticaria incidences in 
the delafloxacin group remained below 2% in both studies. This was not the case in the vancomycin + 
aztreonam group in which pruritus and rash incidences were higher than 2% in both trials. The driver of 
the study difference appears to be the high incidence of pruritus for the vancomycin + aztreonam arm in 
the RX-3341-302 study vs RX-3341-303. 
Three patients in the delafloxacin group had events for potential QT prolongation (syncope) compared 
with 1 patient in the comparator group (loss of consciousness). No patients in either treatment group had 
an event lasting longer than 30 days. No treatment discontinuations or SAEs were attributed to potential 
QT  prolongation  in  patients  treated  with  delafloxacin.  The  events  in  the  delafloxacin  group  were 
considered unrelated to treatment, while the event in the comparator group was considered related to 
treatment. No cardiac safety signal was identified for delafloxacin investigated in phase I studies M01-365 
and  RX-3341-111.  The  individual  case  reports  for  all  events  of  potential  QT  prolongation  in  the 
delafloxacin group were provided. Three cases of syncope were classified as ‘potential QT prolongation’ 
based on the Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs). The investigator did not consider them as due to QT 
prolongation  and  as  such  did  not  consider  ECGs  necessary.  Patient  narratives  were  provided  with 
plausible causality assessment and the events of syncope were considered unrelated to delafloxacin. 
For Cardiac Safety Study RX-3341-111 clarification on 3 subjects who had a change in QT/ QTc interval 
from  baseline  >  60  msec  was  provided.  Given  that  none  of  the  patients  experienced  an  event  of 
arrhythmia and QT prolongations were still below 500ms, no clinically significant QT prolongations seems 
to be apparent. 
With regard to C. difficile diarrhoea no relevant signal could be identified for delafloxacin based on pooled 
and individual study data. The missing case narrative of the one case of C. difficile diarrhoea case in study 
RX-3341-201  was  provided.  Based  on  the  available  data,  a  statement  was  added  to  the  product 
information  that  Clostridioides  difficile-associated  disease  has  been  reported  in  users  of  nearly  all 
systemic antibacterial medicinal products, with severity ranging from mild diarrhoea to fatal colitis. 
In  RX-3341-201,  the  one  case  of  potential  phototoxicity  in  patient  201-215-0005  was  reported  and 
considered unrelated to delafloxacin-treatment. Phase I Study M01-284 was designed to investigate the 
photosensitizing potential of oral delafloxacin at 200 mg and 400 mg doses. No safety signal for potential 
phototoxicity was identified for delafloxacin based on pooled and individual study data. 
Serious AEs and deaths 
Deaths 
There were a total of 4 TEAEs leading to death, 1 in the delafloxacin group (septic shock [RX-3341-302]) 
and  3 
in  the  comparator  group  (myocardial 
infarction  [RX-3341-303]; 
intestinal 
ischemia 
[RX-3341-303];  and  pulmonary  embolism  [RX-3341-302]).  All  of  these  events  were  considered 
unrelated to treatment.  
Serious adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 110/123 
 
 
  
In Phase II and III safety analysis set, six patients were assessed as having SAEs related to treatment, 2 
delafloxacin  patients  (1  patient  with  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  aminotransferase 
(AST) increased and 1 patient with urticaria), and 4 comparator treated patients (2 patients with renal 
failure, 1 patient with acute renal failure, and 1 patient with rash). The overall incidence of SAEs in the 
Phase II and III safety analysis was similar between the delafloxacin treatment group and the comparator 
group (3.7% vs. 3.8%, respectively). There were no differences in the overall incidence of SAEs as well as 
incidences for any SOCs reported except for cellulitis, skin infection, infection and pulmonary embolism 
which were slightly higher in pooled phase III studies compared to phase II studies. In RX-3341-302 and 
RX-3341-303 the most frequent SAE for delafloxacin was cellulitis and skin infection, respectively. One 
AESI  of  urticaria  occurred  in  one  patient  that  was  probably  related  to  delafloxacin  treatment.  The 
applicant sufficiently provided a case narrative for this subject. No differences in the incidence of SAE 
could  be  observed  between  oral  and  intravenous  formulations  of  delafloxacin.  Cases  of  pulmonary 
embolism  were  described  in  more  detail.  No  further  cases  of  VTE  occurred  in  the  delafloxacin  arm  in 
addition to the two cases which have already been reported in the RX-3341-303 trial. Details on the cases 
of pulmonary embolism were provided. VTE and pulmonary embolism were not related to delafloxacin. 
Pregnancies 
There  has  been  one  pregnancy  reported  in  RX-3341-302  which  resulted  in  an  SAE  when  the  patient 
experienced a spontaneous abortion. The event was considered unrelated to study drug. However, based 
on  the  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  use  of  delafloxacin  should  be  contraindicated  in 
pregnancy, in women of childbearing potential not using contraception and in breast-feeding. 
Laboratory findings 
The most common reported laboratory-related TEAEs in the Phase II and III Safety Analysis Set were 
increases in ALT,  AST, serum creatinine and decrease in blood glucose concentration. In general, the 
incidences  of  laboratory-related  TEAEs  were  comparable  between  both  groups  except  for  increase  in 
serum creatinine which was slightly higher in the comparator group then in the delafloxacin group. Based 
on  data  provided  in  the  Phase  II  and  III  Safety  Analysis  Set  no  laboratory-related  safety  signal  was 
identified for delafloxacin. Of note, both pivotal studies enrolled a considerable number of patients with 
documented history of drug and/or alcohol abuse and known hepatitis C infection. No major safety signals 
were apparent in patients with and without a documented history of drug and/or alcohol abuse and known 
hepatitis C infection. 
Safety in special populations 
In the pooled Phase II and Phase III studies, no clinically relevant differences in the safety profile of oral 
and intravenous delafloxacin for the intrinsic factors age, gender, race, ethnicity, BMI category, diabetes 
and  the  extrinsic  factor  geographic  region  was  identified.  Data  on  geriatric  patients  as  well  as  a 
comprehensive  overview  on  preferred  terms  and  SOC’s  for  each  intrinsic  factor  were  provided  and 
showed no major safety signal.  
For patients with renal impairment a comparative description of absolute and relative numbers of TEAEs 
observed in patients with creatinine clearance < and > 90 mL/min stratified by grade of renal impairment 
was  provided.  Separate  tables  with  TEAEs  and  ADRs  (>0.4%)  by  SOC  and  PT  in  patients  with  renal 
impairment and stratified by degree of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe) were presented. No 
safety signal was identified for the different formulations and methods of administration of delafloxacin 
investigated in patients mild to moderate renal impairment. The patients with severe renal impairment 
treated with delafloxacin were too limited to conclude on safety in this population.

Adverse events of delafloxacin in hepatic impaired patients were assessed under the term “History of 
infectious hepatitis”. However, this term does not capture all possible causes for hepatic impairment. In 
addition, patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C liver disease and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3 × ULN 
where  excluded  from  the  two  pivotal  studies.  An  overview  on  safety  data  in  patients  with  hepatic 
impairment included in studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 with or without history of hepatitis was 
provided.  A  comparison  of  ADR  frequencies  by  SOC  and  PT  in  patients  with  and  without  hepatic 
impairment in the Phase II and III safety pool and between individual Phase III studies did not reveal a 
safety signal in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Results  of  safety  analysis  in  study  ML-3341-118  revealed  that  the  most  commonly  treatment-related 
TEAE observed only with oral delafloxacin was diarrhoea which was reported by 3 subjects (13.6%). No 
safety signal was identified for delafloxacin after concomitant administration with midazolam in study 
ML-3341-118. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Summary of phase II and phase III analysis set as well as single reports from the pivotal studies revealed 
that most TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation related to delafloxacin treatment were categorised 
as  hypersensitivity  reactions  such  as  urticaria.  In  both  pivotal  studies  only  AESIs  related  to  potential 
allergic reaction occurred that led to discontinuation of delafloxacin. All cases reported were considered 
related to delafloxacin treatment. Two (0.6%) SAEs in the delafloxacin group led to discontinuation of 
study  drug  in  RX-3341-302  which  were  as  follows:  cellulitis  (unrelated)  and  pyoderma  gangrenosum 
(unrelated). In RX-3341-303, 5 (1.2%) patients in the delafloxacin group experienced a SAE that led to 
study  drug  discontinuation  which  were  as  follows:  acute  respiratory  failure  (unrelated),  urticaria 
(probable related), subdural haematoma (unrelated), pulmonary embolism (unrelated), hypersensitivity 
(probable related) and skin infection (unrelated). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  delafloxacin  was  well  tolerated  during  the  clinical  studies.  By  SOC,  gastrointestinal  disorders 
namely nausea and diarrhoea dominated in the delafloxacin group.  
Overall, the safety profile of delafloxacin appears to be comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones. It is 
acknowledged that the data provided for delafloxacin so far are too limited to conclude on the risk of 
serious ADRs with frequency rare (e.g. tendon rupture) and no comprehensive conclusions on such ADRs 
can  be  drawn.  Nevertheless,  an  improved  safety  profile  compared  to  those  of  other  fluoroquinolones 
could not be demonstrated for delafloxacin. Therefore, a restricted indication (similar to the wording of 
the indication of moxifloxacin) is recommended, which was agreed by the applicant.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of delafloxacin with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers delafloxacin to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Quofenix (delafloxacin) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Skin and soft tissue infections are among the most common infections in both hospitals and community 
settings  and  remain  a  significant  source  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  Acute  Bacterial  Skin  and  Skin 
Structure Infections (ABSSSI) are more serious than uncomplicated skin infections and include cellulitis, 
erysipelas, wound infections and major abscesses which may require significant surgical intervention and 
parenteral antibiotic therapy.  
The most common bacteria identified in ABSSSI are Gram-positive pathogens, including streptococci and 
staphylococci. The most frequently isolated Gram-positive ABSSSI pathogens are S. aureus (including 
methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  (MRSA)  and  methicillin-susceptible  S.  aureus  (MSSA)),  followed  by 
β-haemolytic  streptococci.  However,  in  approximately  14%  of  ABSSSI,  Gram-negative  pathogens  are 
detectable. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A number of antimicrobial agents are available for the treatment of ABSSSI and the benefit of systemic 
antimicrobial  therapy,  accompanied  by  surgical  intervention  as  necessary,  is  clearly  established. 
According to the clinical presentation and including other patient co-morbidities, treatment strategies in 
ABSSSI include both oral therapy and an IV-to-oral switch treatment regimen. In the latter case, since 
therapy on an outpatient basis provides for greater patient convenience and reduced healthcare costs, 
the switch to oral therapy generally occurs as soon as clinically indicated. 
Currently, the only approved agents for the first line treatment of ABSSSI with adequate efficacy against 
MRSA allowing an IV-to-oral switch treatment scheme without necessitating a change in antibiotic and/or 
dose are linezolid and tedizolid phosphate. In particular, linezolid is increasingly utilised in the treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 115/123 
 
 
  
of ABSSSI, particularly if MRSA is considered a likely pathogen. However, its use may be associated with 
myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and lactic acidosis, particularly with therapy longer 
than  typical  for  the  treatment  of  ABSSSI.  These  adverse  effects  have  been  linked  mechanistically  to 
mitochondrial protein synthesis (MPS) inhibition. 
During  the  last  decades,  S.  aureus  has  become  progressively  resistant  to  methicillin  and  has  spread 
worldwide, with an increasing prevalence of community-acquired (CA) MRSA observed in many intensive 
care units and emergency departments. Furthermore, resistance to currently available MRSA drugs has 
increased.  There  is  growing  concern  about  linezolid-resistant  strains,  especially  due  to  the  cfr  gene 
conferring  resistance  to  other  classes  of  ribosome-targeting  antibiotics,  including  clindamycin, 
streptogramins, phenicols, 16-C macrolides, and pleuromutilins. 
Most approved agents for treatment of ABSSSI are only susceptible against Gram-positive pathogens. 
However,  since  Gram-negative  pathogens  may  be  the  causing  pathogens  in  ABSSSI  as  well,  a  new 
antibiotic covering both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria may be of significant benefit. 
Several  fluoroquinolones  (moxifloxacin,  levofloxacin,  ofloxacin)  are  approved  for  the  indication 
cSSTI/ABSSSI as second/last line indication. For moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, the indication cSSTI was 
restricted to second line indication during referral procedures in 2008 and 2012 due to safety concerns. 
During national variation procedures, the SmPC of ofloxacin (originator) was adapted to be in line with the 
outcome of the referral procedure of levofloxacin and accordingly the indication cSSTI was restricted to 
last line indication as well. 
Overall, new antibacterial drugs, especially those available as an oral formulation, are needed to treat 
infections due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in both hospital and community settings. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study RX-3341-302: A randomized, double-blind, multi-center Phase III study investigated the efficacy 
of IV delafloxacin vs vancomycin plus aztreonam in the treatment of patients with ABSSSI for 5 to 14 days 
(n= 660).  
Study  RX-3341-303:  A  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  multi-center  Phase  III  study 
investigated the efficacy of IV (3 days) followed by oral delafloxacin vs vancomycin plus aztreonam in the 
treatment of patients with ABSSSI for overall 5 to 14 days (n= 850). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
IV treatment - Study RX-3341-302: 
Non-inferiority  of  IV  delafloxacin  to  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  was  demonstrated  for  the  co-primary 
analysis populations: ITT and CE. Clinical cure in the ITT population at FU visit was 172/331 (52.0%) in 
the delafloxacin group vs. 166/329 (50.5%) in the vancomycin + aztreonam group, and clinical cure in 
the  CE  population  at  FU  visit  142/240  (59.2%)  in  the  delafloxacin  group  vs.  142/244  (58.2%)  in the 
vancomycin + aztreonam group. The lower limits of the 95% CIs for both co-primary endpoints were 
within -10% (i.e. 1.5% [-6.1, 9.1] for the ITT population and 1.0% [-7.8, 9.7] for the CE population). 
These results were supported by the sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy outcomes.  
Overall, the cure rates were relatively low compared to other studies in ABSSSI. However, this could be 
explained by early time point of the FU visit and strict definition of clinical cure (complete resolution of all 
baseline  signs  and  symptoms  of  ABSSSI  at  FU)  in  line  with  the  recommendation  of  the  antibacterial 
guideline  and  its  Addendum.  It  should  be  considered  that  in other  studies  in the indication  ABSSSI  a 
broader definition for treatment success was chosen (e.g. clinical success defined as improved so far that 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 116/123 
 
 
  
no further antibiotic treatment is necessary). In study RX-3341-302, in the ITT population, success (cure 
+  improved)  at  FU  visit  was  detectable  in  270/331  (81.6%)  in  the  delafloxacin  group  vs.  274/329 
(83.3%) in the vancomycin + aztreonam group. Success (cure + improved) in the CE population at FU 
visit  was  detectable  in  233/240  (97.1%)  in  the  delafloxacin  group  vs.  238/244  (97.5%)  in  the 
vancomycin + aztreonam group.  
IV (3 days) followed by oral treatment - Study RX-3341-303: 
For the primary endpoint of clinical cure, non-inferiority of IV followed by oral delafloxacin to vancomycin 
+ aztreonam was not demonstrated for both co-primary populations. Clinical cure in the ITT population at 
FU  visit  was  244/423  (57.7%)  in  the  delafloxacin  group  vs.  255/427  (59.7%)  in  the  vancomycin  + 
aztreonam group, and clinical cure in the CE population at FU visit 220/353 (62.3%) in the delafloxacin 
group vs. 224/329 (68.1%) in the vancomycin + aztreonam group. The lower limits of 95% CIs were 
within -10% (-2.0% [-8.6, 4.6]) for the ITT population, but not greater than -10% (-5.8% [-12.9, 1.4]) 
in the CE population.  
As stated for study RX-3341-302, the cure rates were relatively low compared to other studies in ABSSSI. 
However, this could be explained by the early time point of the FU visit and strict definition of clinical cure 
(complete  resolution  of  all  baseline  signs  and  symptoms  of  ABSSSI  at  FU)  in  line  with  the 
recommendation of the antibacterial guideline and its Addendum. It should be considered that in other 
studies  in  the  indication  ABSSSI  a  broader  definition  for  treatment  success  was  chosen  (e.g.  clinical 
success defined as improved so far that no further antibiotic treatment is necessary). The success rates 
(cure + improved where the investigator felt that no further antibiotics were needed in the respective 
populations)  in  the  ITT  population  at  FU  were  87.2%  in  the  delafloxacin  group  an  84.8%  in  the 
vancomycin + aztreonam group (95% CI –2.2, 7.2). In the CE-Population the success rates were 96.3% 
in  the  delafloxacin  group  and  97.0%  in  the  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  group  (95%  CI  -3.5,  2.2). 
Accordingly, for the endpoint success at FU visit, non-inferiority of delafloxacin towards vancomycin + 
aztreonam  has  been  demonstrated  for  both  the  ITT  and  CE  population.  Furthermore,  the  applicant 
provided  two  additional  analyses  showing  that  for  study  -303  non-inferiority  could  be  concluded  in  a 
range of scenarios in the sensitivity analysis and that results are closer to the non-inferiority margin with 
imputed observations compared to the original “per protocol” analysis (although based on the missing at 
random assumption). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In  study  RX-3341-302,  non-inferiority  of  IV  delafloxacin  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  ITT  and  CE 
populations (which was further supported by results of phase 2 study RX-3341-202). However, in study 
RX 3341-303, for the primary endpoint of clinical cure, non-inferiority of delafloxacin to vancomycin + 
aztreonam  has  only  been  demonstrated  in  the  ITT  population.  The  CHMP  considered  it  acceptable  to 
consider the single primary population ITT (all randomised patients) for primary analysis and to regard 
the CE population as secondary. 
In the pivotal studies, the TOC visit was timed 14 + 1 days from randomisation (recommended TOC visit 
in the Addendum 7-14 days after last day of treatment). Taking the treatment duration of 5 to 14 days 
into account, the TOC visit was performed between day 0 and day 9 after the last day of treatment. The 
applicant  addressed  this  issue  and  defined  several  additional  analyses  as  sensitivity  analysis.  A  new 
definition of investigator assessment at PTE was introduced within a window of 7 - 14 and 6 - 15 days after 
EOT  (PTE7-14  -  PTE6-15);  all  the  assessments  outside  of  that  window  were  considered  missing,  and 
therefore counted as failure. If, instead, both the assessments are within the defined window after EOT, 
the  earliest  one  (i.e.,  FU  visit)  was  taken.  Overall,  the  used  time  point  of  TOC  visit  was  not  optimal. 
However, additional analyses supported that the FU assessment performed earlier than the window of 7 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/471386/2019 
Page 117/123 
 
 
  
- 14 days after the EOT had a negligible effect on the evaluation of the primary end-point in both pivotal 
studies.  
In study RX-3341-302, the cure rates in the ITT and CE population at PTE, PTE7-14 and PTE6-15 were 
comparable  between  delafloxacin  and  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  groups  and  the  results  of  these 
sensitivity analyses supported the results of the primary analysis.  
In  study  RX-3341-303,  in  the  ITT  population  the  cure  rates  at  PTE,  PTE7-14  and  PTE6-15  were 
comparable between delafloxacin and vancomycin + aztreonam groups. However, in the CE population 
the cure rates at PTE, PTE7-14 and PTE6-15 tended to be in disfavour of delafloxacin (the lower limits of 
95% CIs were below -10%). Overall, the sensitivity analyses supported the results of the primary analysis 
of clinical cure where for the CE population the lower limit of 95% CI was below -10%. 
In study RX-3341-303, the success rates (cure + improved where the investigator felt that no further 
antibiotics were needed in the respective populations) at FU visit were comparable between treatment 
groups  in  both  the  ITT  and  CE  population.  Furthermore,  non-inferiority  of  delafloxacin  towards 
vancomycin + aztreonam for the endpoint success at FU visit has been demonstrated in both the ITT and 
CE population. 
Furthermore, the applicant provided two additional analyses where results showed that for study -303 
non-inferiority could be concluded in a range of scenarios in the sensitivity analysis and that results are 
closer to the non-inferiority margin with imputed observations compared to the original “per protocol” 
analysis (although based on the missing at random assumption).  
In addition, no relevant differences of the predicted plasma exposures (measured on day 1 and day 3 
after IV delafloxacin) in those who did and did not fail between studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 
were detectable which supports the conclusion of non-inferiority. 
Overall, non-inferiority of IV as well as IV followed by oral delafloxacin is concluded. 
In  both  pivotal  studies,  cure  rates  were  considerably  higher  at  FU  visit  in  patients  in  Europe  (study 
RX-3341-302:  delafloxacin  85.7%,  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  70.9%,  n=118;  study  RX-3341-303: 
delafloxacin  67.9%,  vancomycin  +  aztreonam 69.9%;  n=338)  compared to North  America  (study  RX 
3341-302:  delafloxacin  44.0%,  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  46.4%,  n=542;  study  RX  3341-303: 
delafloxacin 46.5%, vancomycin + aztreonam 49.5%; n=398).  
Cure rates at FU visit in patients with cellulitis/erysipelas were higher in delafloxacin group compared to 
comparator group in study RX 3341-302 (delafloxacin: 67.2% n=128; vancomycin + aztreonam: 60.9% 
n=128), whereas in study RX 3341-303 cure rates at FU visit were slightly lower in delafloxacin group 
compared to comparator group (delafloxacin 59.9% n=202 vs. vancomycin + aztreonam 63.1% n=202). 
In  patients  with  major  abscess  cure  rates  at  FU  visit  were  higher  in  delafloxacin  group  compared  to 
vancomycin + aztreonam group in both pivotal studies (study RX 3341-302: delafloxacin 52.4% n=84; 
vancomycin + aztreonam 48.2% n=83; study RX 3341-303: delafloxacin 64.2% n=106; vancomycin + 
aztreonam 57.5% n=106). 
In  contrast,  in  case  of  wound  infection  cure  rates  were  considerably  lower  in  the  delafloxacin  group 
compared  to  the  comparator  group  in  both  pivotal  studies  ((study  RX  3341-302:  delafloxacin  33.6% 
n=116;  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  41.4%  n=116;  study  RX  3341-303:  delafloxacin  46.8%  n=111; 
vancomycin + aztreonam 54.5% n=112). However, further analysis indicated that a different treatment 
effect for the cure rate in patients with wound infection could not be statistically claimed. Furthermore, it 
was  highlighted  that  in  terms  of  success  rate  (cured  or  improved)  the  differences  at  FU  between 
treatment arms in patients with wound infection were negligible in the RX-3341-302 study and the rate of 
success was even higher in patients treated with delafloxacin in the RX-3341-303 study. In addition, the 
Assessment report

Page 118/123 
 
 
  
cure  rates  in  patients  treated  with  delafloxacin  were  also  similar  to  those  in  patients  treated  with 
vancomycin + aztreonam when the analysis considered the assessment at the LFU. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, delafloxacin was well tolerated during clinical studies in the applied IV and oral dosages. The size 
of  the  presented  safety  database  can be  regarded as  appropriate to  characterize  the  safety  profile of 
delafloxacin.  The  overview  of  the  safety  data  suggested  comparable  profiles  for  delafloxacin  and 
comparator vancomycin + aztreonam. The most common TEAEs after administration of delafloxacin were 
nausea (9.1%), diarrhoea (8.6%), infection (5.2%), infusion site extravasation (4.7%), and headache 
(3.5%).  In  the  SOC  gastrointestinal  disorders  more  TEAEs  related  to  study  drugs  were  reported  for 
delafloxacin compared to comparator in Phase 3 studies (10.9 vs. 6.0%) and in Phase 2 studies (25.2 
vs.20.8%). In particular, diarrhoea was regarded as related to study drug more frequently in delafloxacin 
groups (Phase II and III safety analysis set: delafloxacin 6.9% vs. comparator 2.5%). However, most 
cases  of  diarrhoea  were  mild  in  intensity  and  did  not  result  in  a  discontinuation  of  therapy.  When 
comparing both pivotal studies RX-3341-302 and RX-3341-303 no significant differences in safety profile 
could  be  identified.  In  general,  study  RX-3341-303,  which  investigated  intravenous  followed  by  oral 
delafloxacin, tended to have a slightly better safety profile which would be in accordance with the lower 
Cmax  observed  after  a  single  450  mg  oral  dose  of  delafloxacin  compared  to  300  mg  intravenous 
delafloxacin in BE study RX-3341-115.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of delafloxacin appears to be comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones. The 
limitations of direct comparisons of clinical trial results to published meta-analyses across different and 
older studies are acknowledged. It is acknowledged that the data provided for delafloxacin are too limited 
to  conclude  on  the  risk  of  serious  ADRs  with  frequency  rare  and  very  rare  and  no  comprehensive 
conclusions on such ADRs can be drawn. 
No  significant  safety  advantage  over  the  other  fluoroquinolones  is  obvious  that  would  justify  an 
unrestricted  indication  in  ABSSSI.  Therefore,  a  restricted  indication  (in  line  with  the  wording  of  the 
indication of moxifloxacin) is recommended, which was agreed by the applicant.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While for the primary endpoint of clinical cure in study RX-3341-302 non-inferiority of IV delafloxacin has 
been shown in the ITT and CE population, in study RX 3341-303 non-inferiority of IV followed by oral 
delafloxacin  towards  vancomycin  +  aztreonam  was  only  demonstrated  in  the  CE  population.

Nevertheless, when considering the endpoint clinical success at FU visit as accepted in other procedures 
and taking into account the additional analyses provided by the applicant, non-inferiority of IV followed by 
oral delafloxacin towards vancomycin + aztreonam can be concluded as well. 
Overall, the safety profile of delafloxacin appears to be comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones.  
No  significant  safety  advantage  over  the  other  fluoroquinolones  is  obvious  that  would  justify  an 
unrestricted  indication  in  ABSSSI.  Therefore,  a  restricted  indication  (in  line  with  the  wording  of  the 
indication of moxifloxacin) is recommended, which was agreed by the applicant. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the CHMP assessment of the available data, the applicant agreed to restrict the indication. The 
CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  for  acute  bacterial  skin  and  skin  structure  infections 
(ABSSSI)  in  adults  when  it  is  considered  inappropriate  to  use  other  antibacterial  agents  that  are 
commonly recommended for the initial treatment of these infections is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Quofenix is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Quofenix is favourable in the following indication: 
Quofenix is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in 
adults when it is considered inappropriate to use other antibacterial agents that are commonly 
recommended for the initial treatment of these infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that delafloxacin is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

Clinical Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of 
Bulevirtide in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis Delta. 
As a result of this variation, the SmPC, Annex II and 
PL are also updated to reflect the completion of the 
specific obligation and the CHMP recommendation to 
grant a marketing authorisation no longer subject to 
specific obligations. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement editorial changes in the SmPC. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 4.0 
of the RMP has also been approved (Study MYR301 
was reclassified from a Category 2 to a Category 3 
study).

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP 
considered that the Specific Obligation has been fulfilled, 
therefore there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisation to remain conditional and therefore 
recommends the granting of a standard marketing 
authorisation not subject to Specific Obligations for 
Hepcludex.

Following a safety review based on pooled data from clinical 
the warnings for the ADRs ’Increase of bile salts’ and 
’Administration site reactions’ to section 4.8 of the 
SmPC as additional describing information to the 
listed PTs , together with the addition of a new ADR: 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic 
reaction). Further to a safety review based on pooled 
data from clinical trials and post-marketing 
experience, editing of existing ADRs in Section 4.8 
was also carried out. The Package Leaflet was 
updated accordingly.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce minor editorial changes to the PI and to 
bring it in line with the EU QRD template v10.2.

the ADRs ‘Increase of bile salts’ and ‘Administration site 
reactions’ from Section 4.4 to Section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Several PTs in different SOCs from the ADR list in section 
4.8. of the SmPC were also updated. Additionally, a new 
ADR: hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic 
reaction) was included, together with descriptive text of 
“eosinophilia” and the update of the frequency of the ADR 
headache from common to very common, based on the 
frequency observed in the clinical trial programme.

Annex II 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for Hepcludex, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the opinion. 
During the annual renewal procedure, it was brought to 
EMA and the CHMP and the PRAC Rapporteur’s attention by 
Page 9/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the MAH that there was a discrepancy between the PI 
(Annex II.E) and the RMP referring to the classification 
category of the additional pharmacovigilance activities. The 
studies’ classification was adequately reflected in the RMP, 
but not in the PI (Annex II.E) in the list of specific 
obligations. Therefore, amendments to the list of specific 
obligations are required, since only the MYR301 study 
should be classified as category 2 and therefore subject to 
specific obligation listed in the PI (Annex II.E). As 
requested in the RfSI the MAH has corrected the Annex II.E 
to include only MYR301 study as Specific Obligation. 
In addition, milestones of the MYR301 study and MYR-HDV 
registry have been updated in the RMP version 1.1 dated 
17 June 2021. The MAH has also updated the expected 
completion dates for the studies and further aligned the 
RMP with the GVP Module V guidance as requested by EMA.

ADVL0912 and A8081013; as a consequence,

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

in the presence of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily), a 
strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in increases in crizotinib 
systemic exposure, with crizotinib area-under-the-plasma-
concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity 
(AUCinf) and maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax) values that were approximately 3.2 fold and 1.4 
fold, respectively, those seen when crizotinib was 
administered alone. 
Coadministration of repeated doses of crizotinib (250 mg 
once daily) with repeated doses of itraconazole (200 mg 
once daily), a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resulted in increases 
in crizotinib steady-state AUCtau and Cmax, that were 
approximately 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, those 
seen when crizotinib was administered alone. 
Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(including but not limited to atazanavir, ritonavir, 
cobicistat, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, 
voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, and 
erythromycin) should be avoided. Unless the potential 
benefit to the patient outweighs the risk, in which case 
patients should be closely monitored for crizotinib adverse 
events (see section 4.4). 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations 
predicted a 17% increase in crizotinib steady-state AUC 
after treatment with the moderate CYP3A inhibitors, 
diltiazem or verapamil. Caution is therefore recommended 
in case of coadministration of crizotinib with moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors. 
Finally in line with the current recommendations in sections 
4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC, a new warning has been included 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC that grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice should be avoided as it may increase plasma

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

crizotinib should be used with caution in patients with 
hepatic impairment. Based on the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) classification, no starting dose adjustment of 
crizotinib is recommended for patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (either AST > Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) and 
total bilirubin ≤ULN or any AST and total bilirubin >ULN but 
1.5 × ULN). The starting crizotinib dose for patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin 
>1.5 × ULN and 3 × ULN) is recommended to be 200 mg 
twice daily. The starting crizotinib dose for patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (any AST and total bilirubin >3 
× ULN) is recommended to be 250 mg once daily. 
Crizotinib dose adjustment according to Child-Pugh 
classification has not been studied in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Section 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.2 were 
updated to reflect these recommendations, the results from 
study A8081012 and remove the contraindication of 
crizotinib in severe hepatic impairment.

the rifampicin DDI substudy report, a study 
undertaken in order to evaluate the effect of 
rifampicin (a strong inducer of CYP3A) on multiple-
dose PK of crizotinib in advanced cancer patients. 
The provision of the study report addresses a part of 
the post-authorisation measure MEA 009. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
contact details of the local representatives in the

inhibitors or with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
should be avoided. Coadministration of repeated doses of 
crizotinib (250 mg twice daily ) with repeated doses of 
rifampicin (600 mg once daily), a strong CYP3A4 inducer, 
resulted in 84% and 79% decreases in crizotinib steady 
state AUCtau and Cmax, respectively, compared to when 
crizotinib was given alone. The concurrent use of strong 
CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, and 
St. John’s wort, should be avoided. The effect of a 
moderate inducer including but not limited to efavirenz or 
rifabutin is not clearly established therefore, their 
combination with crizotinib should be also avoided.

The following information on the ECG sub-study was 
included in the SmPC: 
An ECG substudy using blinded manual ECG measurements 
was conducted in 52 ALK-positive NSCLC patients who 
received crizotinib 250 mg twice daily. Eleven (21%) 
patients had an increase from Baseline in QTcF value ≥ 30 
to < 60 msec and 1 (2%) patient had an increase from 
Baseline in QTcF value of ≥ 60 msec. No patients had a 
maximum QTcF ≥ 480 msec. The central tendency analysis 
indicated that all upper limits of the 90% CI for the LS 
mean change from Baseline in QTcF at all Cycle 2 Day 1 
time points were < 20 msec. A 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis suggested a 
relationship between crizotinib plasma concentration and 
QTc. In addition, a decrease in heart rate was found to be 
associated with increasing crizotinib plasma concentration 
(see section 4.4), with a maximum mean reduction of 17.8 
beats per minute (bpm) after 8 hours on Cycle 2 Day 1.

non-small cell lung cancer conducted by the MAH confirmed 
there is no need to adjust the dose in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment. The very limited data in 
patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal 
disease did not allow determining the need for dose 
adjustment. This analysis showed that age, body weight 
and gender have no clinically meaningful effect on crizotinib 
pharmacokinetics.  
An in vitro study evaluating the effect of crizotinib as an 
inhibitor of BSEP and renal secretory transporters 
confirmed that crizotinib is an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2 
and could increase plasma concentrations of co-
administered drugs that are substrates of these 
transporters. However crizotinib did not inhibit OAT1 or 
OAT3. 
The in vitro study investigating the effect of crizotinib on 
UGT (notably UGT1A1) indicated that crizotinib is a weak 
inhibitor of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 and may potentially 
increase plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs 
metabolised predominantly by UGT1A1 or UGT2B7. 
Drug-drug interaction studies with proton pump inhibitor 
(PPI) and H2 antagonists were conducted. The extent of 
the change in total exposure of crizotinib observed in these 
studies was not clinically meaningful and therefore co-
administration of PPI and H2 antagonists does not require 
dose adjustment.

Study XT123005 investigating the potential for crizotinib to 
to include the outcome of in vitro studies indicating 
II and PL 
induce CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro using cryopreserved 
that crizotinib is an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and may be 
an inducer of CYP3A4. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet. 
The MAH took also the opportunity of this variation 
to introduce editorial changes in the SmPC and to 
correct discrepancies between section 4 of the PL 
and section 4.8 of the SmPC regarding frequency of 
rash, and leukopenia. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 9.0. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
human hepatocytes was not conclusive and did not rule out 
the potential role of crizotinib as an inducer of CYP3A4. 
Study XT125002 investigated the potential for crizotinib to 
inhibit CYP2B6 activity in vitro, using pooled human liver 
microsomes.  Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC were 
updated to reflect the role of crizotinib as an inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 and as a potential inducer of CYP3A4. The PL was 
updated accordingly.

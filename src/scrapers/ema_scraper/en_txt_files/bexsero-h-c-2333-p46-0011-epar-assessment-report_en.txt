Safety Objectives: 
Primary 
To assess the safety and tolerability of one or two booster doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ 
administered to children starting at 40 months of age who previously received one or four doses 
of the same vaccine in parent study V72P6. 
Secondary 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a two-dose catch-up regimen of rMenB+OMV NZ 
administered to naive children starting at 40 and 60 months of age. 
•  Study design 
This study was an extension of study V72P6. It was conducted as an open-label, single center 
study (Oxford Vaccine Group, Oxford University Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, 
Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK). 
•  Study population /Sample size 
A maximum number of 126 subjects from parent study V72P6 were eligible to participate in this 
extension study. These were the subjects who successfully completed study V72P6 at the Oxford 
Vaccine Group study site. This number excluded V72P6 subjects from the Gloucester Vaccine 
Evaluation Unit, as this center did not participate in the extension study. The actual number of 
subjects enrolled from the parent study was 70, and all subjects were exposed to the study 
vaccine. 
Two groups of around 50 newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 and 60 months of age, were also to 
be enrolled into the study: 43 subjects aged 40 months were actually enrolled and 42 were 
exposed to the study vaccine; 50 subjects aged 60 months were enrolled and 50 were exposed to 
the study vaccine. In total, 163 subjects were enrolled in this study. 
Individuals eligible to be enrolled in the study were healthy 40-44 months old children: 
▫ who participated and completed the V72P6 study (or naive subjects 40 or 60 months of age); 
▫ for whom a parent/legal guardian had given written informed consent after the nature of the 
study had been explained; 
▫ were available for all the visits scheduled in the study; 
▫ were in good health as determined by: medical history, physical examination and clinical 
judgment of the investigator. 
Treatments 
• 
Subjects who completed study V72P6 at the Oxford Vaccine Group study site and who met all other 
enrollment criteria were eligible to participate in this extension study. 
These subjects were treated as follows: 
o  Group 5rMenB (referred to as Group I in protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, 
and 12 months of age with rMenB vaccine in study V72P6 were vaccinated with a single 
booster vaccination of the same vaccine at 40 months of age. 
o  Group 5rMenB+OMV (referred to as Group II in protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated at 
2, 4, 6, and 12 months of age with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in Study V72P6 were vaccinated 
with a single booster vaccination of the same vaccine at 40 months of age. 
o  Group 3rMenB (referred to as Group III in study protocol): Subjects who were vaccinated 
with a single dose of rMenB vaccine in Study V72P6 were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of the 
same vaccine at 40 and 42 months of age.  
o  Group 3rMenB+OMV (referred to as Group IV in study protocol): Subjects who were 
vaccinated with a single dose of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine in study V72P6 were vaccinated with 
2 vaccinations1 of the same vaccine at 40 and 42 months of age.

Two additional vaccine groups, each consisting of 50 newly recruited, naive subjects, 40 and 60 
months of age, were enrolled in the study. These subjects were treated as follows:  
o  Group Naive_4042 (referred to as Group V in the protocol): Naive subjects recruited at 40 
months of age were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months 
apart, at 40 and 42 months of age. 
o  Group Naive_6062 (referred to as Group VI in the protocol): Naive subjects recruited at 60 
months of age were vaccinated with 2 vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ, given two months 
apart, at 60 and 62 months of age. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Serum bactericidal activity was measured against N meningitidis serogroup B indicator strains 
H44/76, 5/99, NZ98/254 and M10713. Data was summarized by calculating hSBA geometric mean 
titers (GMTs), percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥ 1:4 and ≥ 1:8, and percentage of subjects with 
four-fold increase over baseline. Antibody response to vaccine antigen 287-953 was also to be 
determined by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and summarized by geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) and four-fold rises. 
Antibody persistence and booster immune responses were interpreted using data from the naive 
groups of children recruited at 40 and 60 months of age, as indicated below. 
o  Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 40 months of age (group 
Naive_4042) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 40 
months of age for groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 3rMenB+OMV. 
o  Responses to the first and second catch-up vaccinations of rMenB+OMV NZ administered to 
naive subjects at 40 and 42 months of age (group Naive_4042) served as a descriptive 
comparator to evaluate booster responses and, in turn, the presence of immunological 
memory in groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 3rMenB+OMV. 
o  Baseline antibody levels measured in naive subjects at 60 months of age (group 
Naive_6062) served as a descriptive comparator to evaluate antibody persistence at 60 
months of age postbooster vaccination in groups 5rMenB, 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB, and 
3rMenB+OMV, and post-2 dose catch-up in group Naive_4042.  
Safety Endpoints 
All subjects who received at least one vaccination of rMenB±OMV NZ and provided some safety data 
postvaccination with rMenB±OMV NZ (defined as the safety population) were included in the safety 
and tolerability analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive. 
Local and Systemic Adverse Events 
Incidences of local AEs (ie, pain, erythema, induration, swelling) and systemic AEs (ie, fever 
[defined as axillary temperature ≥ 38°C], change in eating habits, sleepiness, irritability, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring during the 7 days following each study 
vaccination were summarized by maximal severity and vaccine group. Additionally, the numbers of 
subjects who used analgesic or antipyretic medication (prophylactically or therapeutically) within 7 
days of study vaccination were summarized. Erythema, induration and swelling were categorized as 
none, 0<-10 mm, 10 < -25 mm, 25 < -50 mm, 50 < -100 mm and > 100 mm. Temperature taken 
by the axillary route were categorized as < 38°C, 38- < 38.5°C, 38.5- < 39°C, 39- < 39.5°C, 39.5- 
< 40°C, and ≥ 40°C. All other systemic AEs were categorized as present or not present, and if 
present as mild, moderate or severe. 
Unsolicited Adverse Events 
All unsolicited AEs that occurred during the 7 days following each study vaccination were collected. 
All SAEs, as well as AEs that required a medical visit and/or resulted in premature withdrawal from 
the study were collected throughout the study period, except for the 7 days after each vaccination 
with rMenB±OMV NZ in which all AEs were collected. 
All reported unsolicited AEs, as well as AEs that were at least possibly related to rMenB±OMV NZ 
were summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within each system organ 
class. These summaries were presented by vaccine group. When an AE occurred more than once for 
a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine were counted. 
Additionally, separate summaries of AEs were generated as follows: (i) SAEs, (ii) AEs that were 
possibly or probably related to vaccine, and (iii) AEs that were unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of

all AEs were provided by subject. In addition, a summary of the primary termination reasons, a 
listing of subjects withdrawn from the study because of an AE, and a listing of all termination 
reasons were presented. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Due to the small sample size in each vaccine group, the analyses of safety and immunogenicity 
were purely descriptive. As such, no statistical tests were performed. The primary analysis of the 
immunogenicity results were based on the modified Intention-to-treat population (MITT). All safety 
analyses were based on the safety population. 
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 163 subjects were enrolled in this extension study and 162 received at least one study 
vaccination. Of the 126 subjects that were eligible from the parent study 70 were enrolled in this 
extension study. Two groups of newly recruited, naive subjects were enrolled; a total of 43 
subjects aged 40 months and 50 subjects aged 60 months.  
A summary of the number of subjects who were enrolled, who completed or discontinued the 
study, by vaccination group, is provided in Table 10.1-1. Among enrolled subjects, a total of 23 
(14%) discontinued the study. Most subjects who discontinued withdrew consent or were lost to 
follow-up. Three (3) subjects discontinued due to protocol violations (moved out of area) and one 
(1) subject discontinued due to inappropriate enrolment.  
The immunogenicity MITT analyses for persistence at 40 months included 108 subjects, while the 
MITT population for analysing persistence at 60 months included 134 subjects. One hundred and 
sixty (160) subjects were included for the MITT booster analyses and 82 were part of the MITT 2-
dose catch-up analyses (table 11.1-1)

Assessor´s comment: It is noted that the number of enrolled subjects is limited and that less than half 
of the eligible subjects from the parent study were enrolled into this extension study. The study groups 
are small and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should therefore be made with 
caution. Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from 
this study.

•  Baseline data 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were similar across groups, except for gender 
differences. A higher percentage of male subjects were enrolled in groups 5rMenB+OMV (53%) 
and 3rMenB+OMV (63%), while a higher percentage of females were enrolled in groups 
Naive_4042 (53%) and Naive_6062 (54%).  
Efficacy results 
• 
Primary endpoint. 
To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 40 months of age who previously 
received four doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age in parent study 
V72P6.

Prior to booster vaccination at 40 months of age, GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects in 
the vaccinated group had decreased to low levels approaching baseline and were comparable to 
those of the naïve group for all reference strains except strain 5/99. For strain 5/99 vaccinated 
subjects had a mean GMT of 28 (10-77) compared to 1.11 (0.9-1.36) of naive subjects, and 76% of 
vaccinated subjects were seropositive whereas 3% (one individual) of naïve subjects were 
seropositive. 
Assessor´s comment: The decrease in GMTs and proportion of seropositive subjects was not 
unexpected and could indicate the need for a booster vaccination at 40 months of age. However, the 
number of subjects is very small, and confirmation is needed from larger studies.

Secondary endpoints 
a.  To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 40 months of age who previously 
received a single dose of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ at 12 months of age in parent study 
V72P6 
At 40 months of age GMTs and the proportion of seropositive subjects had decreased to 
approximately baseline levels. 
Assessor´s comment: During initial assessment for market authorization this vaccination regime was 
considered insufficient to provide relevant protection, and the persistence antibodies at 40 weeks of 
age is therefore regarded to be of limited interest. 
b.  To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or 
rMenB+OMV NZ administered at 40 months of age to children who previously received four 
doses of the same vaccine as infants in parent study V72P6.

One month post booster or first vaccination in the extension study individuals receiving booster 
vaccinations had higher levels of GMTs and a greater proportion of subjects were seropositive as 
compared to naïve individuals indicating the presence of immunological memory. The levels of 
GMTs after booster at 40 months of age were at the same level or slightly higher than those 
induced by the previous booster vaccination at 12 months of age. 
c.  To characterize the bactericidal antibody response of a booster dose of rMenB or 
MenB+OMV NZ administered at 40 months of age and a second booster dose administered 
at 42 months of age to children who previously received a single dose of the same vaccine 
as infants in parent study V72P6.

One month post booster at 42 months of age or post second vaccination of naïve individuals both 
groups showed an increase in GMTs as well as a greater proportion of seropositive subjects 
indication the presence of immunological memory. The levels were comparable to those of group 
5rMenB+OMV one month after the single booster dose (secondary endpoint b).

One month post second vaccination an increase in GMTs and the proportion of seropositive 
subjects against all strains was demonstrated compared to baseline in both groups. In naïve 
subjects vaccinated at 40 and 42 weeks of age the magnitude of GMTs were comparable to those 
5rMenB+OMV one month after the booster dose at 40 weeks of age (secondary endpoint b) 
whereas levels appeared slightly lower in naïve subjects vaccinated at 60 and 62 weeks of age. 
The proportions of seropositive subjects one month after second vaccination were comparable to 
those of 5rMenB+OMV one month after the booster dose at 40 weeks of age for both groups of 
naïve subjects. 18 months after the second vaccination GMTs and proportions of seropositive 
subjects in group Naïve_4042 had decreased and approached the levels at baseline for all 
antigens except strain 5/99. 
Assessor´s comments: It is noted that it appears that older children (60 months of age) had a lower 
response than 40 month old children. The clinical relevance of this is, however, unclear. 
e.  To explore bactericidal antibody persistence in children at 60 months of age who received 
one or two booster doses of rMenB or rMenB+OMV NZ, or a two-dose catch-up regimen of 
rMenB+OMV NZ starting at 40 months of age in the present extension study.

At 60 months of age a decrease in GMTs and proportions of seropositive subjects were 
demonstrated in groups 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB+OMV and Naïve_4042 as compared to one month 
after the last vaccination (secondary endpoints b, c and d). In group 5rMenB+OMV GMTs had 
returned to similar levels as baseline in the extension study (prior to the booster dose at 40 
months of age). In group 3rMenB+OMV, GMT levels decreased but were still above baseline.

Booster doses/repeated doses resulted in a substantial increase in GMCs across all groups. At 60 
months of age in groups 5rMenB+OMV, 3rMenB+OMV and Naive_4042, levels of GMCs had been 
reduced about 10-fold but remained above baseline.  
Assessor’s general comment on efficacy results:  
Due to the limited sample size, no firm conclusions are drawn from the data presented from this study 
and interpretation of data and comparisons between groups should be made with caution. During initial 
assessment for market authorisation it was noted that immune responses to vaccination with 
rMenB+OMV NZ in the parent study V72P6 were lower than those of other studies, including the 
pivotal study V72P13. Responses presented in this extension study are also comparatively low, but 
considering the levels of the parent study and the limited sample size, there is not enough concern to 
indicate reduced immunogenicity of vaccination from the data presented here. 
It is also noted that baseline values for strain M10713 in the newly recruited groups Naive_4042 and 
Naive_6062 are high. The analytical method for this strain was, however, subject to discussion during 
initial assessment, and the ELISA was also considered relevant. This issue will not be commented on 
further in this report.

The study was considered a success if, at one month following the second vaccination, the two-
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio of the hSBA GMTs for each of 3 serogroup B 
reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) and the twosided 95% CI of the ratio of the ELISA 
GMCs against vaccine antigen 287-953 are contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0). 
Secondary objectives: 
a)  To assess the immune response at one month after a primary vaccination course of two 
rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 and as measured by the ratio of hSBA postvaccination to pre-
vaccination GMTs [GMR] against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 
5/99, and NZ98/254). 
b)  To assess the immune response at one month after a primary vaccination course of two 
rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by the ratio of ELISA 
post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs [GMR] against vaccine antigen 287-953. 
c)  To evaluate the immune response at two weeks after a primary vaccination course of two 
rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by hSBA GMT, the ratio 
of hSBA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMTs [GMR], and the percentage of subjects 
with hSBA ≥1:5 against 3 N. meningitidis  serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, 
and NZ98/254). 
d)  To evaluate the immune response at two weeks after a primary vaccination course of two 
rMenB+OMV NZ doses administered one month apart as measured by ELISA GMC and the 
ratio of ELISA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs [GMR] against vaccine antigen 
287-953. 
Analyses related to the secondary objectives are descriptive only. There are no statistical 
hypotheses related to the secondary immunogenicity objectives. 
Safety Objective: 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two doses of two rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine lots formulated 
with OMV manufactured at 2 different manufacturing sites, given one month apart, in healthy 
adolescents. 
•  Study design 
This was a Phase 3, multicenter (7 sites in Canada and 6 sites in Australia), observer-blind 
randomized trial in adolescents (11-17 years, inclusive). All subjects received two rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccinations one month apart and were followed for a total of 2 months. Subjects were randomized 
to 1 of 2 treatment arms to receive either two doses of rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine Lot 1 or 2 doses of 
rMenB+OMV NZ Lot 2. Lot 1 was formulated with OMV manufactured in Novartis Rosia facility and 
Lot 2 from Novartis Siena facility. 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Overall, 320 subjects were planned to be enrolled, with 160 subjects per lot who were to be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Estimating a total drop-out rate of 15%, a sample size of 135 evaluable 
subjects per arm were planned to be vaccinated with rMenB+OMV NZ in the groups Lot 1_Rosia 
and Lot 2_Siena, respectively. Assuming an underlying GMT (or GMC) ratio of 1.0 and that the 
results for the three strains and vaccine antigen 287-953 are independent, the overall power to 
demonstrate immunologic consistency is approximately 93.6%. The power to reject the null 
hypothesis associated with the primary immunogenicity objective is the probability that, for each 
strain or vaccine antigen 287-953, the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of 
GMTs (or GMCs) at 1 month after the second vaccination is entirely contained within the interval 
(0.5, 2.0).  
All subjects who received at least one vaccination were to be included in the safety analyses.  
Individuals eligible were to be enrolled into this study were male and female subjects:  
o  11-17 years of age inclusive who had given their written assent and whose parents or legal 
guardians provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment;  
o  who were available for all the visits scheduled in the study (i.e., did not leave the area 
before the end of the study period);  
in good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination, and 
clinical judgment of the investigator.

Treatments 
• 
Enrolled subjects were randomised into two groups and vaccinated with Novartis Meningococcal B 
Recombinant+OMV NZ vaccine (rMenB+OMV NZ); 
o  Group Lot 1_Rosia; Lot 1 formulated with OMV manufactured in Rosia site 
o  Group Lot 2_Siena: Lot 2 formulated with OMV manufactured in Siena site  
Treatments were given twice one month apart followed by a one month long follow up period. The 
total study period was two months. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity endpoints 
The Serum Bactericidal Assay (SBA) using human serum as the source of exogenous complement 
(hSBA) was used to measure the induction of functional bactericidal antibodies directed against 
serogroup B meningococci following vaccination with rMenB+OMV. An Enzyme-Linked 
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was also used to measure immune response to vaccination.  
The primary immunogenicity variables were:  
o  The ratio of the vaccine lot hSBA GMTs for each of the three serogroup B reference strains 
(H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254) at one month after the second vaccination.  
o  The ratio of the vaccine lot ELISA GMCs for the 287-953 vaccine antigen at one month 
after the second vaccination.  
Equivalence of the immune response of the two lots of rMenB+OMV NZ, each formulated with OMV 
manufactured at a different sites, assessed at one month after the second vaccination based on 
the ratio of the vaccine lot hSBA GMTs for each of three serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 
5/99, and NZ98/254) and based on the ratio of ELISA GMCs for vaccine antigen 287-953. The 
equivalence interval was (0.5, 2.0). An additional blood draw in a subset of subjects at two weeks 
after the second dose was also collected. 
Additional secondary analyses at each time point included the percentage of subjects with hSBA 
≥1:5, which is above the historically defined threshold titer (1:4) that correlates to clinical 
protection, and the GMR to baseline at each time point.  
Safety endpoints 
All subjects who received at least one vaccination of rMenB+OMV NZ and provided some safety 
data post vaccination were included in the safety analyses. All safety analyses were descriptive. 
Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions 
Post-vaccination reactions reported from day 1 to day 7 after each vaccination were summarized 
by maximal severity and by vaccine group. The severity of local reactions, including injection-site 
erythema, induration, and swelling was categorized as none (0 mm), 1 to <25 mm, 25 to <50 
mm, 50 to <100 mm and ≥100 mm (severe local reactions). The severity of pain and systemic 
reactions (i.e., nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache and rash) occurring up to 7 days 
(including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination was categorized as none, mild (transient 
with no limitation in normal daily activity), moderate (some limitation in normal daily activity), and 
severe (unable to perform normal daily activity). Rash was categorized as none, urticarial, and 
other. Frequencies and percentages of subjects experiencing each local and systemic reaction 
during days 1 to 3 after vaccination were similarly summarized, as well as daily frequencies and 
the time of onset of the first reactions. Each local and systemic reaction was also categorized as 
none vs. any. Body temperature (regardless of the route of measurement) was analyzed in 0.5°C 
increments as follow <38.0°C (no fever), 38.0-38.4°C, 38.5°C - 38.9°C, 39.0°C – 39.4°C, 39.5°C 
– 39.9°C, ≥40.0°C. Additionally, the number and percentage of subjects who used analgesic or 
antipyretic medication were summarized in addition to the number and percentage of subjects who 
stayed home due to a reaction.  
Other Adverse events 
All reported adverse events, as well as adverse events judged as at least possibly related to study 
vaccine, were summarized according to system organ class and preferred term within system 
organ class. These summaries were presented by vaccination group. When an adverse event 
occurred, more than once for a subject, the maximal severity and strongest relationship to the 
vaccine group was counted. Additionally, three separate summaries were produced: (i) serious 
adverse events, (ii) adverse events that are possibly or probably related to vaccine, and (iii) 
adverse events that are unrelated to vaccine. Data listings of all adverse events were provided by 
subject. In addition, a listing of subjects withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event 
was presented, as well as a listing of adverse events leading to hospitalization.

•  Statistical Methods 
The null hypothesis associated with the lot-to-lot immunogenicity objective was that for at least 
one strain at one month after the second vaccination, the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of hSBA 
GMTs (strains H44/76, 5/99, or NZ98/254) or the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of the ELISA 
GMCs (vaccine antigen 257-953) was outside the interval (0.5, 2.0).  
For each of the three strains and the 287-953 vaccine antigen, lot-to-lot consistency for the 2 lots 
of rMenB+OMV NZ was assessed in terms of log10-transformed hSBA GMTs or log10-transformed 
ELISA GMCs at one month after the second vaccination.  
Analyses related to the secondary objectives were descriptive only. Therefore, there were no 
statistical hypotheses related to the secondary immunogenicity objectives.  
  Results 
•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, 344 subjects aged 11 to 17 years were enrolled in the study. Of these, 170 were included 
in Lot1_Rosia and 174 subjects in Lot2_Siena. The immunogenicity per protocol population (PP) 
comprised of 299 subjects, 147 subjects from Lot1_Rosia and 152 subjects from Lot2_Siena. An 
immunogenicity subset PP population of 147 subjects (76 in Lot1_Rosia and 71 in Lot2_Siena) was 
analyzed at two weeks after second vaccination. 
The safety population was composed of 342 subjects; 169 subjects in Lot1_Rosia and 173 subjects 
in Lot2_Siena. Two of the enrolled subjects (59/001/Lot1_Rosia and 52/023/Lot2_Siena) did not 
receive any vaccination at all, and were therefore excluded from safety analyses.  
A summary of the number of subjects who were enrolled, who completed or discontinued the 
study, by vaccination group, is provided in table 2-2. Among enrolled subjects, a total of 6 subjects 
(2%) discontinued the study. Five of the six subjects who discontinued withdrew consent whereas 
one subject from Lot2_Siena reported an adverse event “Infectious Mononucleosis” with moderate 
severity which led to premature withdrawal from the study.  
•  Baseline data 
The demographic and other baseline characteristics for the enrolled population in the Lot1_Rosia 
and Lot2_Siena were well matched, except for gender differences. There was a 5% difference in 
percentage of males (58% and 53%) and females (42% and 47%) between Lot1_Rosia and 
Lot2_Siena, respectively. The majority of subjects in the Lot1_Rosia and Lot2_Siena groups were 
White. These gender differences did not affect the lot consistency conclusions for this study.

Assessor’s comment: It is unclear how the GMT for the total population can be higher than the 
GMTs for each group for strain 44/76-SL at one month after the 2nd vaccination, and lower for the 
total population for strain 5/99 than in each for the groups. This should be clarified.  
Post-script: The company responded to the Assessor’s request for clarification in August 2014. The 
apparent mistake is due the use of adjusted and unadjusted GMTs values for different groups in 
the same Table. The responses were accepted and the submission is considered fulfilled 
The primary objective to demonstrate equivalence of rMenB+OMV NZ lot 1 to rMenB+OMV NZ lot 2 
at one month after second vaccination was met for the 3 N. meningitidis serogroup reference 
strains H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254 and for the vaccine antigen 287-953. The two-sided 95% CI 
of the ratio of the hSBA GMTs for each of the 3 serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and 
NZ98/254) and the two-sided 95% CI of the ratio of the ELISA GMCs against vaccine antigen 287-
953 were each contained within the interval (0.5, 2.0  
Secondary endpoints: 
Immune response at one month after second vaccination: Percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 
and as measured by the ratio of hSBA postvaccination to pre-vaccination GMTs [GMR] against 3 N. 
meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, and NZ98/254).

Ratio of ELISA post-vaccination to pre-vaccination GMCs (GMR) against vaccine antigen 287-953.  
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) GMR to baseline at one month after second 
vaccination, against vaccine antigen 287-953, was found to be slightly higher in Lot2_Siena (154) 
when compared to Lot1_Rosia (115), but the GMRs for each lot had overlapping 95% CIs (Table 2-
6).  
Immune response at two weeks after second vaccination: Human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) 
GMT, the ratio of hSBA post-vaccination to prevaccination GMTs (GMR), and the percentage of 
subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 against 3 N. meningitidis serogroup B reference strains (H44/76, 5/99, 
and NZ98/254).  
In general, there was a decline in hSBA GMT levels and GMRs measured at one month after the 
second vaccination when compared to the respective titer levels and GMRs measured at two weeks 
after the second vaccination, for all three reference strains and for both Lot1_Rosia and 
Lot2_Siena.  
At two weeks and one month after the second vaccination, all subjects (100%) receiving 
Lot1_Rosia and Lot2_Siena attained hSBA levels ≥1:5, against N. meningitidis serogroup B 
reference strains H44/76 and 5/99. However against reference strain NZ98/254, for both lots, the 
percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:5 was higher at two weeks compared to one month after 
vaccination (96% and 84% at 2 weeks post vaccination vs. 80% and 64% one month after 
vaccination, for Lot2_Siena and Lot1_Rosia, respectively.

Assessor´s comment: the primary objective was met and similarity between lots 1 and 2 was 
demonstrated. Levels of GMTs and GMCs were comparable to those of other studies. A decrease in 
GMTs and GMCs was demonstrated between the time points two weeks after second vaccination and 
one month after second vaccination. This was not unexpected. No European centers were included in 
the study, the lack of data from European adolescents was discussed during initial assessment, and it 
was concluded that the applicant should provide data on adolescent in the EU.  
The data presented from this study gives no reason for concern regarding immunogenicity of 
vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ. 
•  Safety results 
An overview of subjects with adverse events is provided in table 2-9 and numbers of subjects with 
local and systemic reactions, by vaccination, are summarized in tables 2-10 and 2-11, respectively.  
One subject from Lot2_Siena (51/013) withdrew from the study on day 34 due to an adverse event 
of infectious mononucleosis that started on day 14, with moderate severity and was judged as 
unrelated to the study vaccine by the investigator

Overall, percentages of subjects who reported with solicited systemic reaction appeared to be 
slightly higher in Lot2_Siena when compared to Lot1_Rosia. The most frequently reported solicited 
systemic reaction after any vaccination was myalgia, reported in 59% of subjects in Lot1_Rosia 
and 68% of subjects in Lot2_Siena. The majority of the solicited local reactions reported were of 
mild to moderate intensity. Severe intensity of pain was reported in 14% of subjects in Lot1_Rosia 
and 17% of subjects from Lot2_Siena. Fever (≥ 38°C) was an uncommon symptom, reported in 
5% of subjects in Lot 1_Rosia and 3% of subjects in Lot 2_Siena.  
. 
Assessor’s comment: Although systemic adverse reactions appeared to be more common in 
Lot2_Siena, the clinical relevance of this is unclear. Apart from this the data from the two groups were 
similar and the safety results presented in this study are in agreement with previously presented 
results. No new safety concerns are raised based on this study.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The submitted studies were intended to explore aspects of persistence of immunogenicity and safety 
following different vaccination schedules in children aged up to 60 months of age as well as the 
similarity in immunogenicity and safety profile between two lots of vaccine with OMV produced at 
different sites in adolescents aged 11 to 17 years. The results of the studies generally confirm what is 
already known regarding immunogenicity and safety of Bexsero, although there is an apparent 
inconsistency in the results as described in the comments above. This should be clarified. Therefore no 
further regulatory action regarding Bexsero is required based on the presented results.

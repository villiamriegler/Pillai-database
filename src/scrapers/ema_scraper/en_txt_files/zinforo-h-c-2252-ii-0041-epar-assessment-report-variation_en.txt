Ceftaroline fosamil is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to one 
or more penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). As a results built up of bacterial cell wall is disturbed and that leads 
to cell death. Ceftaroline fosamil exhibits unique properties that distinguish it from other β lactams, due to 
its high affinity for PBP2a in MRSA and PBP2x in PRSP that contribute to its potent antibacterial activity 
against these organisms. 
Ceftaroline fosamil is currently approved for adults and children above the age of 2 months for the treatment 
of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and community acquired pneumonia (CAP).  
The paediatric approval for the above mentioned age groups was granted in the EU in June 2016. 
This application is to extend the approved indications to children aged from birth to less than 2 months of 
age and includes the appropriate dose recommendations for this age subgroup. Both cSSTI and CAP are 
relatively rare in children aged less than 2 months; neonates are often affected by the late onset neonatal 
sepsis (LOS), disease with high mortality and disability rates.  
Data on prevalence of cSSTI in neonates are hectic and appropriate epidemiological studies are still scarce. 
Superficial skin infections have been described but likely do not need systemic antibacterial treatment. 
Despite this, in hospitalised patients antibacterial treatment is usually employed.   
Another group of neonates with skin and soft tissue infections are those admitted to neonatal intensive care 
unit and having surgical wounds or indwelling catheters. Similar to adults, the SSTI are mostly caused by 
S.aureus, but may be caused by Gram negative microorganisms if occurring in perianal area. Coagulase

negative staphylococci (CoNS) that do not cause cSSTI in adults and older children may be identified as 
causative agents, especially if cSSTI is related to indwelling catheters. The rates of infections caused by 
MRSA depend on the geographical location, similar to adults. Worldwide most CoNS have acquired mecA 
gene and thus are resistant to classical staphylococcal antibiotics like oxacillin and first/second generation 
cephalosporins.  
CAP is rare in neonates as well. However, if it occurs, then it is mostly caused by group B streptococci, 
followed by S.aureus and E.coli. This is in contrast to adults and older children in whom Streptococcus 
pneumonia and Mycoplasma dominate (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2012;00: e78–85). 
There are no specific guidelines for treatment of cSSTI in neonates. Therefore recommendations similar to 
older children should apply. Antistaphylococcal beta-lactams are most commonly recommended and used in 
case of methicillin susceptible S.aureus (MSSA).  
Vancomycin or clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxasol are recommended if MRSA is suspected or 
confirmed (Clinical Infectious Diseases 2014;59(2):e10–52; Arch Dis Child. 2016 Jan;101(1):72-6). 
Surgical treatment is employed similar to adults and older children. 
Ampicillin + aminoglycoside or alternatively third generation cephalopsorins are recommended for 
treatment of CAP in neonates (The Paediatric Infectious Disease Journal. 31(6):e78–e85). In case of 
staphylococcal pneumonia, antistaphylococcal penicillins are used. 
Ceftaroline fosamil as an agent with the antibacterial activity against S.aureus, CoNS and non-ESBL 
producing Enterobactriaceae is an alternative antibiotic for treatment of cSSTI and CAP in neonates.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology profile of ceftaroline fosamil was described 
and assessed in the initial marketing authorization application. Subsequently, addenda to the nonclinical 
summaries (additional pharmacology information and juvenile toxicity studies conducted to support the 
paediatric development program) were submitted and assessed by CHMP in 2015. They are summarised 
below:

Updated  in  vitro  susceptibility  data  were  also  submitted  and  assessed  by  CHMP  in  2015,  in  the  initial 
paediatric extension of indication.  
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019 
Page 9/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
There are no additional in vitro microbiology studies performed for the current submission, which was 
considered acceptable by CHMP. 
In  summary,  the  in  vitro  activity  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  has  been  reported  against  clinically  important 
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and complicated skin and soft tissue (cSSTI) pathogens, relevant to 
the Zinforo prescribing information. 
Ceftaroline fosamil activity was assessed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from 
adult  and  paediatric  infected  patients.  Overall,  susceptibility  to  ceftaroline  fosamil  was  similar  between 
isolates  from  paediatric  and  adult  age  groups  for  the  relevant  pathogens  causing  skin  and  respiratory 
infections. However, susceptibility varied ±1 doubling dilution in the  MIC90 values for S. aureus (MRSA) 
depending  on  the  geographic  region.  MRSA  isolates  from  children  were  generally  more  susceptible  to 
ceftaroline fosamil than adult isolates by one doubling dilution. 
The fastidious Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae, β-haemolytic streptococci) and Gram-negative (Haemophilus 
species)  isolates  obtained  from  both  age  groups  were  highly  susceptible  to  ceftaroline  fosamil  when 
assessed using established interpretative criteria on susceptibility.  
Against Enterobacteriaceae ceftaroline fosamil is active only against non-ESBL-producing strains. Isolates 
from adult and paediatric patients showed comparable susceptibilities across different geographic regions. 
The MAH has concluded that ceftaroline fosamil is equally active against adult and paediatric isolates that are 
clinically  important  in  the  two  indicated  infection  types.  CHMP  agreed  to  this  conclusion.  During  the 
assessment,  CHMP  requested  the  MAH  to  provide  in  vitro  data  about  the  microorganisms  relevant  for 
neonates (CoNS and non-ESBL producing Enterobacteria). The MAH has provided MIC distribution data for 
CoNS  and  non-ESBL  Enterobacteriaceae  which  showed  good  susceptibility  of  these  microorganisms  to 
ceftaroline. These data are reassuring and suggest that ceftaroline could potentially be used for treatment of 
infections caused by abovementioned microorganisms. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  additional  nonclinical  pharmacokinetic  data  were  submitted  for  assessment,  which  was  considered 
acceptable by CHMP.  
The originally intended doses of ceftaroline fosamil proposed by the MAH in paediatric patients with normal 
renal function and mild renal impairment are 12 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 400 mg) administered 
every 8 hours as a 1 hour infusion to paediatric patients ≥2 years and 8 mg/kg ceftaroline fosamil every 8 
hours as a 1 hour infusion in children 2 months to <2 years.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was given to male and female neonatal rats by slow intravenous bolus dose for 14 days 
from  PND  7  to  21.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  was  well  tolerated,  no  new  target  organs  were  identified  and  the 
NOAEL was the highest dose tested (270 mg/kg).  
Exposure  levels  (AUC(0-t))  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  tested  in  the  juvenile  rat  at  270  mg/kg/day  were 
approximately  2  to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline 
fosamil (based on simulations) in patients with mild renal impairment.  
The  maximum  plasma  levels  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  tested  in  the  juvenile  rat  at  270  mg/kg/day  were 
approximately 20 to 28-fold higher than the predicted median steady state Cmax values of ceftaroline fosamil 
(based on simulations) in patients with mild renal impairment.

Other toxicity studies 
Ceftaroline  fosamil:  14  day  intravenous  dose  range  finding  toxicity  study  in  the  neonatal  rat 
(study number: 20011802 (3011LR))  
Ceftaroline fosamil was administered once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley rat pups (Crl:CD[SD]) from 
Post Natal Day (PND) 7 to 21 via an intravenous (bolus) injection (lateral tail vein) at 0, 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg 
to groups of 4 males and 4 females (main study) and 24 males and 24 females (toxicokinetic [TK] study) 
(20011802 (3011LR)). Controls were given 39.5 mg/mL of L-Arginine in 0.9% (w/v) Sodium Chloride for 
Injection.  Dams  were  not  given  the  test  or  control  articles.  Clinical  signs,  body  weights,  body  weight 
changes,  urine  analysis,  toxicokinetic  parameters  (ceftaroline,  ceftaroline  fosamil,  or  ceftaroline  M-1 
metabolite  [primary  inactive  metabolite]),  organ  weights,  and  gross  and  microscopic  observations  were 
measured/conducted.  
There  were  no  test  article-related  clinical  signs,  however  injection  site  reactions  occurred  at  all  doses, 
including  controls.  Body  weights  and  body  weight  gains  were  not  affected  at  any  dose.  Urine  analysis 
parameters  were  comparable  among  the  doses.  There  were  no  test  article-related  gross  lesions  or 
microscopic  findings,  or  any  changes  in  organ  weights  at  any  dose  that  were  considered  related  to 
ceftaroline fosamil (brain, paired kidneys and spleen).

Ceftaroline  fosamil:  14  day  intravenous  toxicity  study  in  the  neonatal  rats  with  a  4-week 
recovery period (20011803 (3012LR))  
Ceftaroline fosamil was given once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD[SD]) rat pups from PND 7 to 
21 via an intravenous injection at 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg to groups of 20 males and 20 females (main and 
recovery study) and 36 males and 36 females (TK study) (20011803 (3012LR)). Controls were given 35.5 
mg/mL of L-arginine in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride for injection.  
Dams  were  not  dosed  during  this  study,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  body  weight  changes,  functional 
observational battery (FOB), urine analysis, haematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights, and gross and 
microscopic observations were investigated.  
There were no test article-related deaths during this study. Morbidity and/or mortality occurred in 7 rats (3 
main and 4 satellites). The premature decedents occurred in the control group and at 30 and 90 mg/kg (2, 
3 and 2 rats respectively). In these seven animals, four were related to an injury (i.e., broken limb at 30 
mg/kg, laceration on the chest at 30 mg/kg, laceration on the back at 0 mg/kg, or de-sheathing of the tail 
at 90 mg/kg), one was considered secondary to the intravenous dosing procedure (i.e., an embolism in the 
lungs), and two (one at 0 mg/kg and one at 30 mg/kg) had no known cause of death. All other animals 
survived to scheduled euthanasia on PND 22 (end of dose period) or PND 50 (end of recovery period). 
Injection site reactions (swelling, discoloration or ulceration) were seen at all doses, including the controls; 
however,  these  injection  site  reactions  were  attributed  to  the  route  of  administration.  At  the  end  of  the 
dosing and recovery periods, body weight gains in both sexes were comparable with controls.  
There were no test article-related effects on clinical pathology parameters (haematology and urine analysis) 
at the end of the dosing or recovery periods. There were no test article-related effects on organ weights 
(brain, paired kidneys and spleen) at the end of the dosing and recovery periods.  There was an equivocal 
test article-related increase in the incidence of cysts/pitted surfaces of the kidneys in both sexes at PND 50.  
Cysts were lined by a single layer of epithelium with a lumen size at least the diameter of two tubules in the 
region and involved a small area of the kidney. Minimal fibrosis occasionally encircled the cysts and, due to 
of its focal nature, was considered not to be of toxicological concern. 
Table 4 Summary of Microscopic Findings (PND 22) 
Microscopic findings in the kidney, observed at the end of the recovery period (PND 50), were similar in 
appearance to those observed at PND 22 (i.e., renal cyst with occasional minimal fibrosis).

Table 5 Summary of Microscopic Findings (PND 50) 
An increased macroscopic incidence of kidneys with cysts or pitted surfaces was observed at the end of the 
recovery period (PND 50) in both sexes at all doses (when compared to published background macroscopic 
and microscopic renal findings in Sprague-Dawley rats).  
Microscopically, an increased and variable incidence of renal cysts was present at all doses at PND 22 and 
PND 55 in rats, including controls (Owen et al 1986). The incidence was also increased when compared to a 
recent  histological  review of  renal  cysts  in  45  day old  control  Sprague  Dawley  rats  (McKay  2012)  which 
revealed  an  overall  incidence  of  renal  cysts  of  less  than  10%.  This  observation  may  suggest  a  possible 
procedural-related effect in the current study. This is supported by current literature in which it is suggested 
that glucocorticoids play a key role in nephrogenesis in young rodents and that excess corticosteroids can 
potentially lead to cystogenesis (McDonald et al., 2011, Gupta et al., 2001, Chan et al., 2010).  
The  juvenile  rats  in  this  study  were  being  dosed  during  a  time  period  which  coincides  with  active 
nephrogenesis (PND 1 to PND 11) (Zoetis et al., 2003) and so a potential stress-associated effect on tubule 
development,  secondary  to  the  intravenous  dosing  procedure  should  be  considered.  An  additional 
consideration is that all animals received a high volume daily bolus injection of ceftaroline fosamil or the 
control article. This could also cause altered electrolyte and fluid homeostasis in the kidney and contribute to 
renal tubule dilatation and cyst formation. This phenomenon has been described in the beagle dog following 
administration of high oral doses of potent diuretics. 
This finding did not fully correlate with the microscopic findings, as cysts were also identified histologically in 
control rats.  As these findings involved only a small portion of the kidney, were present in control, and 
occurred in the absence of significant changes in renal function or urinary parameters, they were considered 
not to be adverse.  
At the end of the recovery period (PND 50) there was an increase in the incidence of cysts at all doses in 
males  and  at  270  mg/kg/day  in  females.  This  was  accompanied  by  an  increased  incidence  of  pericystic 
fibrosis at 90 and 270 mg/kg/day (both sexes). 
When the males were evaluated on PND 50, the maximum and average values recorded in the forelimb grip 
test  were  decreased  at  270  mg/kg.  Conversely,  in  females,  increased  maximum  (p≤0.05)  and  average 
values were recorded in the fore- and hind limb grip tests in this same dose group on PND 50. The differences 
observed in these tests were considered incidental, and not related to the test article as: 1) alterations in 
movement were not observed in these rats; and 2) opposing observations occurred in males (i.e., decrease 
in grip strength) and females (i.e., increase in grip strength). There were no other test article-related effects 
on neurobehavioral endpoints. 
A significant elevation (p ≤0.05) of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was observed on PND 22 in males at 270 
mg/kg. As individual variation was large and there was no correlation of higher values with cyst occurrence, 
this was considered not to be of toxicological significance. There were no other test article-related effects on 
clinical chemistry endpoints.

The NOAEL was considered to be 270 mg/kg in juvenile, suckling rats.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has submitted an Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) as part of the application. 
In accordance with the SmPC, the maximum daily dose of ceftaroline fosamil is 1200 mg/day. For infections 
caused by S. aureus in adults, the maximum dose may be increased to 1800 mg/day. After administration, 
ceftaroline fosamil is converted to microbiologically active ceftaroline in the body. Following administration 
87.5 % of the dose was excreted in the urine and 5.95 % in faeces. About 64 % of the dose was excreted in 
urine as ceftaroline fosamil, in faeces ceftaroline fosamil was detected only 0.05 %. Ceftaroline fosamil was 
not detected in urine or faeces in humans. 
The MAH has provided its Phase I assessment. Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity (PBT) 
 <0, i.e. less than trigger 
was performed. At all environmentally relevant pHs ceftaroline fosamil has logDow
value 4.5. The study data have been already provided during the initial marketing authorization application. 
Further PBT screening is not required.  
Further, data for Fpen refinement have been provided. Patient consumption of the prodrug in Slovenia has 
been used to calculate the market penetration factor. Based on historical data from 2013-2017 Slovenia was 
the EU country with the highest per capita use of cetraroline fosamil. The maximum annual consumption 
from all products used in Slovenia was 1.12 kg in 2015. Based on existing data the proposed new indication 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019 
Page 14/74 
 
  
  
 
 
is  expected  to  increase  overall  consumption  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  by  less  than  3%:  for  CAP  increase  of 
0.0074%,  and  for  cSSTi  ca  2.354  %  occurs.  Taking  into  account  the  predicted  future  consumption  in 
Slovenia is not expected to exceed 1.15 kg per year, and dose 1200 mg/inh/d, refined Fpen is 0.000113% 
(population of Slovenia taken 2.064 million). 
Considering  the  conversion  from  ceftaroline  fosamil  to  ceftaroline  in  the  body,  PECsw(using  refined  Fpen 
value)  is  0.00068  µg/L  (phase  II  trigger  value  is  0.01  µg/L),  the  MAH  has  concluded  that  a  Phase  II 
assessment is not required. CHMP agreed to this conclusion. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Exposure  levels  (AUC(0-t))  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  tested  in  the  juvenile  rat  at  270  mg/kg/day  were 
approximately  2  to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline 
fosamil  (based  on  simulations)  in  paediatric  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.  The  maximum  plasma 
levels of ceftaroline fosamil tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 20 to 28-fold 
higher than the predicted median steady state Cmax values of ceftaroline fosamil (based on simulations) in 
paediatric patients with mild renal impairment. 
Therefore, in the studies number: 20011802 (3011LR) and 20011803 (3012LR) the pharmacokinetics and 
toxicity of ceftaroline fosamil and the major metabolite M1 were assessed in the early life of rats (PND 7 - 
50), which in humans corresponds to the term newborn infants. Studies showed that ceftaroline fosamil and 
metabolite M1 do not cause significant toxicological changes. CHMP agreed that no additional non-clinical 
toxicology studies are required. Of note, section 5.3 of Zinforo SmPC already includes a description of the 
juivenile toxicity data: “Juvenile toxicity Intravenous bolus dosing of ceftaroline fosamil to suckling rats from 
post-natal day 7 to 20 was well tolerated at plasma exposures approximately 2-fold higher than those for 
paediatric patients. Renal cortical cysts were observed in all groups, including controls, on PND50. The cysts 
involved a small portion of the kidney and occurred in the absence of significant changes in either renal 
function or urinary parameters. Therefore, these findings were not considered to be adverse.”  
ERA 
As previously discussed, during the initial marketing authorization application in 2013, a full ERA programme 
was  performed.  While  using  default  Fpen,  value  PECsw  was  6  µg/L.  The  provided  study  results  on 
physical-chemical properties, fate, and effects resulted in low risk levels: PEC/PNEC value for surface water 
was 0.025, for ground water 0.003, and for sewage treatment plant microorganisms 0.001. The lowest PNEC 
value  is  for  the  Cyanobacterium  Anabaena  flos-aquae,  based  on  the  lowest  No  Observed  Effect 
Concentration (NOEC): 1.2 μg/L. An assessment factor of 10 is applied, in accordance with EMA guidance, 
resulting in PNEC = 1.2 μg/L /10 = 0.12 μg/L. 
Using PECsw for increased consumption (provided above), the PEC/PNEC value for surface water is 0.00068 
/ 0.12 = 0.00567.  
CHMP  noted  that  the  MAH  also  published  the  environmental  risk  assessment  data  on  its  website.  The 
PEC/PNEC ratio is currently indicated as 2.4 x 10-4, which is a lower prevalence/consumption data ratio than 
that used than in the ERA submitted for assessment. It is recommended that this information is updated on 
the MAH website. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Two juvenile toxicity rat studies were conducted in support of the use of Zinforo in paediatric patients aged 
from 2 months to less than 18 years with CAP or cSSTI and were submitted and assessed by CHMP in an 
earlier regulatory procedure.  To summarise, in the non-GLP dose range finding study ceftaroline fosamil

was  given  once  daily  to  neonatal  Sprague-Dawley  rat  pups  from  Post  Natal  Day  (PND)  7  to  21  via  an 
intravenous injection at 0, 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg. In this study ceftaroline fosamil was well tolerated and did 
not result in any mortality or clinical signs. There were no apparent changes in body weight, body weight 
gains, organ weights (brain, paired kidneys and spleen) or urine analysis parameters. There were no gross 
and microscopic findings considered related to ceftaroline fosamil at any dose.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was given once daily to neonatal Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD[SD]) rat pups from PND 7 to 
21 via an intravenous injection at 30, 90 or 270 mg/kg (GLP study). Transient reductions in body weight 
gains occurred in both sexes at all doses at the start of the dosing period; however, these reductions did not 
persist. At the end of study, there were no relevant test article-related effects on clinical signs, body weight, 
neurobehavioral parameters, clinical pathology parameters or organ weights. 
Exposure  levels  (AUC0-t)  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  tested  in  the  juvenile  rat  at  270  mg/kg/day  were 
approximately  2  to  3-fold  higher  than  the  predicted  median  steady  state  AUC(0-24)  values  of  ceftaroline 
fosamil  (based  on  simulations)  in  paediatric  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.  The  maximum  plasma 
levels of ceftaroline fosamil tested in the juvenile rat at 270 mg/kg/day were approximately 20 to 28-fold 
higher than the predicted median steady state Cmax values of ceftaroline fosamil (based on simulations). 
Exposures at 30 and 90 mg/kg/day were at or below the predicted clinical exposures. 
There were observations of microscopic renal cysts in male rats at 90 mg/kg (PND 22) and in both sexes at 
(PND  55)  there  were  considered  possibly  test  article-related,  but  not  adverse,  due  to  the  small  area 
involved, presence in control, normal morphology of the overall kidney, and lack of changes in renal function 
or urine parameters. Based on the results of this study, CHMP considered 270 mg/kg to be the No Observed 
Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL).  
However at the end of the recovery period (PND 50) there was an increase in the incidence of cysts at all 
doses  in  males  and  at  270  mg/kg/day  in  females.  This  was  accompanied  by  an  increased  incidence  of 
pericystic fibrosis at 90 and 270 mg/kg/day (both sexes). Since this could indicate a progression of these 
effects, which were not present in the controls and therefore cannot be attributed to procedural factors, and 
considering  that the  kidney  has  been  identified  as the  primary  target organ  of  toxicity  in  adult  rats  and 
monkeys,  and  that  the  extension  of  the  indication  sought  includes  very  young  children  (from  birth  to  2 
months of age) the MAH was asked by CHMP to further discuss the renal findings in juvenile rats, and to 
justify the conclusion that these findings are not adverse. 
The MAH clarified that overall, the cysts involved only a small area of the kidney and the fibrosis was focal 
and  minimal  in  nature,  both  occurred  in  the  absence  of  significant  changes  in  renal  function  or  urinary 
parameters and they did not appear to have any significant implications for the animals (no adverse clinical 
signs; only transient effects were noted on body weight gain and no significant changes were observed in 
clinical pathology or organ weights. It is therefore considered that they are considered not to be adverse. 
CHMP agreed to this position. 
Therefore, in the studies number: 20011802 (3011LR) and 20011803 (3012LR) the pharmacokinetics and 
toxicity of ceftalorine and the major metabolite M1 were assessed in the early life of rats (PND 7 - 50), 
which  in  humans  corresponds  to  the  term  newborn  infants.  Studies  showed  that  ceftaroline  fosamil  and 
metabolite M1 do not cause significant toxicological changes. CHMP agreed that no additional non-clinical 
toxicity studies are required. 
In vitro microbiology 
There were no additional in vitro microbiology studies performed for the current application. The relevant 
data has been reported and assessed by CHMP in the frame of the previous paediatric extension of indication 
application (II/022). At CHMP request, additional data about the microorganisms relevant to the neonates 
were submitted and assessed.

ERA 
According  to  the  guideline  EMA/CHMP/44609/2010  “Questions  and  answers  on  'Guideline  on  the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use”, in Phase I it is allowed to perform 
PECsw refinement based on prevalence data. 
In the same document in answer to Question 2 “What is required for an ERA for a type II variation or an 
extension application?”, it is stated that the submission of a new ERA is needed for a type II variation or a 
line extension if an increase in environmental exposure is expected. For these types of applications, the 
environmental data previously submitted in the original dossier of the same MAH can be used. Nevertheless, 
the ERA dossier may need to be updated. There is no unique value of what constitutes a significant increase. 
This will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. 
CHMP noted that in the case of the present application, there is an increase in the overall consumption of 
ceftaroline fosamil, but by less than 3%. When considering the data provided in the original ERA dossier 
(PEC/PNEC value for surface water was 0.025), it appears that due to using actual prevalence data, the 
updated PEC/PNEC value for surface water is 0.00567, i.e. less than initially indicated. As the outcome of 
ERA is also not changed (“No environmentally related labels are proposed for ceftaroline fosamil”), there is 
no need to further update the dossier. 
CHMP agreed that the updated data submitted in this application show that the extended indication does not 
lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo). 
Considering the available data, Zinforo is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Special populations 
Selection of Doses in Study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 
The safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetics of ceftaroline fosamil at a dose of 600 mg every 12 hours 
(q12h) were established in adults with normal renal function or mild renal impairment.   
In adolescent subjects (12 to 17 years; Study P903-15) with normal renal function who received 8 mg/kg 
ceftaroline  fosamil  (or  600  mg  for  subjects  weighing  >  75  kg),  the  mean  values  for  Cmax  and  AUC  for 
ceftaroline fosamil were about 10% and 23% less, respectively, than the values observed in adults following 
administration of a 600-mg dose of ceftaroline fosamil. 
In Study D3720C00006 (P903-21), at a dose of 10 mg/kg, the predicted ceftaroline fosamil AUC and Cmax 
for children 6 to 11 years of age with normal renal function were within 10% and 30%, respectively, of the 
predicted AUC and Cmax in adults dosed with 600 mg ceftaroline fosamil every 12 hours (q12h).   
Because ceftaroline fosamil is mainly cleared via renal excretion, and renal function in children (adjusted for 
body size) is at adult levels by the age of 2 years, the dose in subsequent cohorts of descending age was 
modified to achieve appropriate exposure. 
After at least 4 evaluable subjects (defined as subjects who received the entire dose of ceftaroline fosamil 
and from whom at least 3 PK samples were collected) were enrolled in each cohort (up to and including 
Cohort 3 [young infants and toddlers ages ≥ 28 days to < 2 years]), PK samples from these subjects were 
analyzed to obtain plasma concentrations and the data were added to the population PK model.   
The dosing regimens (a single dose administration) evaluated were as follows: 
•  Cohort 1 (≥ 6 years to < 12 years): 10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg for subjects ≥ 60 kg) as a 1-hour 
infusion 
•  Cohort 2 (≥ 2 to < 6 years): 15 mg/kg as a 1.5-hour infusion 
•  Cohort 3 (≥ 28 days to < 2 years): ≥ 5 months: 12 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion; < 5 months: 8 mg/kg 
as a 1-hour infusion  
•  Cohort  4  (term  [gestational  age  ≥  38  weeks]  neonates  <  28  days)  and  Cohort  5  (preterm 
[gestational age 32 to 37 weeks] neonates ages < 28 days): 8 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion 
Selection of Doses in Study D3720C00009 (C2661002) 
Study D3270C00009 was an open label, single-arm steady state study with no randomization.  At least 24 
patients with LOS were to be enrolled and treated within 3 age cohorts of 8 patients each: young infants 
aged >28 days to <60 days, term neonates aged 7 to ≤28 days, and preterm neonates aged 7 to ≤28 days.    
Patients treated under protocol editions 1 and 2 were dosed with ceftaroline fosamil 4 mg/kg as a 60 minute 
infusion every 8 hours (q8h).  This initial dosing regimen was based on the exposure observed in adolescent 
patients in Study P903-15, single-dose safety study and PK data in patients from birth to <12 years in Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019

P903-21, and predicted exposures from a population PK model.  After updating the population PK model with 
additional paediatric data (described below), the ceftaroline fosamil dose was adjusted to 6 mg/kg as a 60 
minute infusion q8h in protocol version 3. All patients treated under protocol edition 3 forward received 
ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg q8h. 
The dosing regimen for ceftaroline fosamil (6 mg/kg q8h as a 60 [±10] minute infusion) was chosen based 
on a population PK model updated with PK data from 3 multiple-dose safety and efficacy studies in children 
aged 2 months to <18 years (Studies P903-23, P903-31 and P903-24). These data were used in conjunction 
with  adult  patient  and  healthy  volunteer  data  and  data  from  single-dose  ceftaroline  fosamil  PK  studies 
conducted  in  children  from  neonates  to  <18 years.    The  ceftaroline  fosamil  population  PK  model 
incorporated allometric scaling for body weight and maturation of renal function.  This model was used in 
Monte Carlo simulations to choose and justify the dose regimens for children aged 2 months to 18 years, 
now included in the European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).   
CHMP noted that the dose selection in infants less than 2 months of age seemed well justified and agreed 
that a stepwise modification of the final ceftaroline fosamil dose based on the cumulating evidence from the 
clinical PK studies and modelling and simulation are clearly explained and supported by data.  
Summary of PK results of study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 
A single dose paediatric PK study (Study P903-21) enrolled 23 neonates (11 preterm GA 32 to 37 weeks and 
12 term neonates ≤28 days) receiving a dose regimen of ceftaroline fosamil 8 mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion.  
The young infant cohort in that study comprised ages >28 days to <2 years (n=12) and did not enroll any 
subjects between the ages of >28 and ≤60 days. 
In Study D3720C00006 (P903-21), after ≥4 evaluable subjects had been enrolled in a cohort (up to and 
including Cohort 3), PK samples from these subjects were analyzed for ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline 
fosamil (prodrug) concentrations. Because this study used a sparse sampling strategy, PK parameters were 
not calculated for each subject by noncompartmental analysis. Plasma concentration data for ceftaroline 
fosamil and ceftaroline fosamil were pooled with data from other studies in adults and adolescent subjects in 
a population PK analysis.   
Ceftaroline fosamil was measureable in all PK samples collected from all subjects.  The doses used in this 
study  achieved  ceftaroline  fosamil  exposures  in  paediatric  subjects  that  exceeded  the  minimum 
concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC90) for ceftaroline fosamil against S. 
aureus for more than 50% of an 8-hour dosing interval. The values of T<MIC were taken from preclinical 
studies. Findings based on ceftaroline fosamil concentrations in the plasma samples taken at the end of the 
ceftaroline  fosamil  infusion  suggest  that  ceftaroline  fosamil  was  cleared  more  slowly  by  the  youngest 
subjects (term and preterm neonates < 28 days), consistent with immature renal function in this younger 
age range and that maturation of renal function may impact ceftaroline fosamil clearance in the youngest 
subjects. 
Ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations were variable, and were typically only measureable in plasma 
samples taken at the end of the ceftaroline fosamil infusion or 15 to 45 minutes after the end of infusion. This 
is  expected  based  on  the  rapid  conversion  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  to  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  plasma.    Eight 
subjects  had  no  measureable  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  any  of  their  plasma  samples;  however,  all  of  these 
subjects  had  significant  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  ceftaroline  fosamil  M-1  levels  that  were  consistent  with 
appropriate dosing of ceftaroline fosamil.  Two subjects did not have the first 2 PK samples collected and did 
not have measureable ceftaroline fosamil in the last 2 PK samples. 
Ceftaroline fosamil M-1 was measureable in all plasma samples collected from all subjects.  Results were 
consistent with data in healthy adult subjects and reflective of the longer T1/2 of ceftaroline fosamil M-1 
compared to ceftaroline fosamil.

Summary of PK results of Study D3720C00009 (C2661002) 
In  Study  D3720C00009  (C2661002),  patients  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  at  enrollment  to  1  of  2  PK 
sampling schedules; 2 samples were to be collected at steady-state.  Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) 
at the time of enrolment to one of the PK sample collection schedules: 
• PK Schedule 1: at the end of the ceftaroline fosamil infusion (±5 minutes) and 3 to 4 hours after the end 
of the infusion; 
• PK Schedule 2: 15 minutes to 2 hours after the end of the ceftaroline fosamil infusion and 5 to 7 hours after 
the end of the infusion (before the start of the next infusion). 
At  the  time  of  early  study  closure,  eleven  (11)  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  received  study 
treatment: 4 (36.4%) patients were in Cohort 1 (young infants), 5 (45.5%) in Cohort 2 (term neonates), 
and 2 (18.2%) in Cohort 3 (preterm neonates).  All enrolled patients completed the study.   
All patients (N=11) contributed at least 1 PK sample for a total of 19 plasma samples; 8 patients contributed 
2 samples and 3 patients contributed 1 sample each. No cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected 
from any patients in the study.  Ceftaroline fosamil was measurable (> lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) 
in only 3 plasma samples while ceftaroline fosamil and ceftaroline fosamil M-1 (inactive metabolite) were 
measurable in all 19 plasma samples.   
The sparse ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations were evaluated using graphical analysis, comparing 
with plasma concentration data from previous ceftaroline fosamil studies in paediatric patients aged from 
birth to <2 years old, and by using a predictive check (simulation) approach.  
CHMP noted that a sparse strategy was used to collect PK samples and agreed to this approach, considering 
the vulnerability of the study population, the relatively rare clinical indication, and the availability of PK data 
in older infants. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
(PBP), which inhibits their function and produces the death of bacteria.  Ceftaroline fosamil exhibits unique 
properties that distinguish it from other β-lactams due to its high affinity for PBP2a in MRSA and PBP2x in 
PRSP that contribute to its potent antibacterial activity against these organisms. 
As  with  other  β-lactam  antibiotics,  the  percentage  of  time  that  free  drug  concentrations  are  above  the 
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria during a dosing interval (%fT>MC) has been shown 
to be the PK/(PD) index associated with efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in the murine thigh and lung infection 
models.  In these models, median values of 36% and 44% fT>MIC were associated with 1-log kill of S. 
aureus and S. pneumoniae, respectively. 
CHMP noted that no new studies have been conducted in regard to this application, and this was considered 
acceptable. The appropriateness of the PD targets of 36% and 44% of fT>MIC was discussed and the MAH 
was asked to perform further simulations by using microorganisms that are relevant for neonates (CoNS and 
non-ESBL producing enterobacteria) and fT>MIC values of 60% and 100%, to address some concern that 
higher PDT may be needed for preterm neonates, which is a special vulnerable and relatively immune 
deficient population. The additional analyses performed by the MAH (simulations made using MIC values of 
0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L) have shown that the required PTA was above 90% for 60% fT>MIC; CHMP considered 
this to be acceptable; if 100% fT>MIC was considered, the PTA was well below 90%. It cannot be excluded

that, as for adults and older paediatric age groups, a higher dose may need to be considered in case of skin 
infections produced by pathogens with higher MICs. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The dosing regimen for ceftaroline fosamil (6 mg/kg q8h as a 60 [±10] minute infusion) was chosen based 
on a population PK model updated with PK data from 3 multiple-dose safety and efficacy studies in children 
aged 2 months to <18 years (Studies P903-23, P903-31 and P903-24). The ceftaroline fosamil population 
PK model incorporated allometric scaling for body weight and maturation of renal function. 
This model was also used in the Monte Carlo simulations to choose and justify the dose regimens for children 
aged 2 months to 18 years, at the time of approval in the EU.   
The same model was used to predict doses for children <2 months of age, including preterm neonates (with 
a postmenstrual age of 28 to 41 weeks).  Postmenstrual age is defined as gestational age plus chronological 
age. Various dosing regimens were simulated using body weights for each simulated patient based on age in 
accordance with either Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts for neonates that 
were  born  to  term  or  in  accordance  with  intrauterine  growth  curves  for  preterm  to  term  neonates 
(gestational age 32-40 weeks).  One hundred simulations were performed for each dose with 600 (300 male 
and 300 female) patients from each age group.  The age groups were categorized as follows: 28 to <30, 
30 to <32, 32 to <34, 34 to <36, 36 to <38, 38 to <40 postmenstrual weeks; 0 to <1, 1 to <2, 2 to <6, 
6 to <12, 12 to <18, 18 to <24 months. 
Using the updated model, several dose regimens were assessed and a dose of 6 mg/kg ceftaroline fosamil 
q8h as a 60-minute infusion was predicted to achieve >90% probability of target attainment (PTA) for MICs 
≤2 mg/L.  Predicted ceftaroline fosamil exposures (based on steady-state maximum concentration [Cmax, ss] 
and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC24,ss]) in paediatric patients younger 
than 2 months old and of gestational age 32-48 weeks dosed with 6 mg/kg q8h as a 60-minute infusion do 
not appreciably exceed ceftaroline fosamil exposures in adults dosed with the currently approved ceftaroline 
fosamil regimen of 600 mg every 12 hours (q12h).  The median ceftaroline fosamil Cmax values in paediatric 
patients in this age range dosed with the proposed regimen (6 mg/kg q8h) were predicted to be less than the 
median ceftaroline fosamil value in adults dosed with 600 mg q12h.  Median steady-state ceftaroline fosamil 
 values in paediatric patients younger than 2 months old and of gestational age 32-48 weeks dosed 
AUC24
with the proposed regimen were predicted to be no more than 17% higher than the median adult value.   
Based on these findings, the updated model was used to optimize the dose for neonates and young infants 
(6 mg/kg q8h as a 60-minute infusion) in Study D3720C00009 (C2661002).   
PK Modelling and Simulation (PMAR-EQDD-C266b-Other-809) 
After completion of Study C2661002, PK data from that study were assessed in population PK modelling and 
simulation analyses.  
The updated population PK model described previously to support the approved paediatric doses for children 
>2 months (CPT-MS-08), and to select the doses for the neonatal study (Study C2661002), including the 
change of dose from 4 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, was utilized for these analyses.  A pooled Pop PK analysis data set 
for the 10 adult Phase 1 studies, 6 adult Phase 2/3 studies, 2 paediatric Phase 1 studies, and 3 paediatric 
Phase 2/3/4 studies was available from the analysis for CPT-MS-08.   
Only data from paediatric subjects aged <2 years old were extracted from this data set for use in the current 
analysis.    A  total  of  87  paediatric  subjects  <2  years  of  age  contributing  59  ceftaroline  fosamil  and  227 
ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations were available in the previous Pop PK data set for the CPT-MS-08 
report.

A single dose paediatric PK study (Study P903-21) enrolled 23 neonates (11 preterm GA 32 to 37 weeks and 
12 term neonates ≤28 days) receiving a dose regimen of ceftaroline fosamil 8 mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion.  
The young infant cohort in that study comprised ages >28 days to <2 years (n=12) and did not enrol any 
subjects  between  the  ages  of  >28  and  ≤60  days.  The  other  paediatric  studies  enrolled  subjects  aged  2 
months  and  above.  However,  the  data  from  this  age  cohort  remain  relevant  for  comparison  of  model 
predictions with the observed data from Cohort 1 of Study C2661002, as the relevant covariates of size and 
renal function are continuous in the Pop PK model and thus allow interpolation. 
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the ceftaroline and ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations in all 
the paediatric studies was 0.05 mg/mL. Plasma ceftaroline and ceftaroline fosamil samples below limit of 
quantification (BLQ) were excluded from graphical and Pop PK analyses. 
Simulation was conducted using the parameter estimates from the previous Pop PK final model, with all 
covariate effects maintained (allometric scaling by weight, body surface area (BSA)-normalised creatinine 
clearance (CLcr), age (maturation), population (patients)). Only inter-individual and residual random effects 
were  used.  Assessment  was  based  on  the  median  and  90%  prediction  interval  (PI)  constructed  from  a 
simulation  with  1000  subproblems,  and  overlaid  with  the  observed  ceftaroline  fosamil  plasma 
concentration-time data from Study C2661002. It should be noted that concentrations were normalised to 6 
mg/kg for 3 subjects (1 subject in each cohort) who received the lower dose of 4 mg/kg prior to protocol 
amendment 2. 
Due  to  early  study  closure,  a  total  of  11  subjects  (originally  planned  for  24  subjects)  contributed  3 
ceftaroline  fosamil  and  19  ceftaroline  fosamil  non-BLQ  plasma  concentrations  to  the  final  data  of  Study 
C2661002. All 11 subjects received at least 1 dose of ceftaroline fosamil and had at least 1 PK sample. 
Results from PK modeling and simulation 
Graphical data analysis was conducted with R (version 3.2.2) and R libraries (such as ggplot2 version 1.0.1, 
dplyr version 0.4.3). The sparse steady-state ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations (normalised to 6 
mg/kg)  obtained  from  the  neonatal  Study  C2661002  are  consistent  with  concentrations  observed in  the 
earlier paediatric studies (Studies P903-21, P903-23, P903-24, and P903-31). 
The  following  figure  shows  the  dose-normalised  ceftaroline  fosamil  plasma  concentrations  from  Study 
C2661002, overlaid with the concentration-time data included in the previous Pop PK data set for similar age 
cohorts. The observed data (normalised to 6 mg/kg) from the neonatal Study C2661002 are consistent with 
concentrations  observed  in  the  earlier  paediatric  studies  (Studies  P903-21,  P903-23,  P903-24,  and 
P903-31), which provides support for the use of the predictive check approach.

The  following  figure  shows  a  non-linear  relationship  (consistent  with  the  modified  Rhodin  maturation 
function) of nCRCL and post-natal age in days, with the x-axis limited to 200 days. In general, the nCRCL 
from the 11 paediatric subjects in Study C2661002 lie within the distribution of the prior data. This supports 
the continuous size and the renal maturation function in the Pop PK model and thus supports interpolation / 
extrapolation.

Simulations of individual profiles (87 paediatric subjects from birth to <2 years old [of which 52 subjects 
were from the safety / efficacy studies] from the previous Pop PK data set) with 1000 sub-problems were 
performed. The Pop PK analysis was performed using a nonlinear mixed effects modelling methodology as 
implemented  in  the  NONMEM  software  system,  version  7.3.0.  All  subjects  assumed  a  dose  regimen  of 
ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg q8h IV infusion given over 1 hour for 14 days.

Cohort  for  Ceftaroline  fosamil  based  on  1000  Simulations  (6  mg/kg  q8h,  1  hour  infusion  at 
steady-state)  Overlaid  with  Observed  Data  (normalized  to  6  mg/kg)  from  Study  C2661002 
(blue X). 
All of the observed steady-state ceftaroline fosamil plasma concentrations (normalised to 6 mg/kg) from the 
neonatal  Study  C2661002  laid  within  the  90%  PI  with  the  exception  of  2  observations  in  the  full-term 
neonate cohort. These samples were collected at approximately 2 hours and 6 hours after the start of the 
same infusion from the same subject (ID = 9046005) and have most likely been inadvertently switched 
when  labeled  with  collection  times,  as  there  is  no  plausible  biological  explanation  for  increasing  drug 
concentrations  after  end  of  infusion.  A  switch  of  time  for  the  values  brings  both  these  values  into  the 
predicted range. 
Predicted ceftaroline fosamil exposures (maximum concentration at steady-state (CmaxSS) and area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve over 24 hours at steady-state (AUC24SS)) in paediatric subjects aged 
<2 months with normal renal function or mild renal impairment dosed with ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg q8h 
as  a  1  hour  (or  a  5  minute)  IV  infusion  are  similar  to  and  do  not  exceed  ceftaroline  fosamil  exposures 
(CmaxSS) in adults dosed with the approved ceftaroline fosamil regimen of 600 mg every 12 hours (q12h). 
Target attainment simulations 
Ceftaroline fosamil steady-state PK exposure and PTA simulations for paediatric subjects with normal renal 
function  or  mild  renal  impairment  had  been  performed  previously  for  a  wide  range  of  mg/kg  doses 
administered  q8h;  2  to  14  mg/kg  over  l  hour  infusion,  and  2  to  18  mg/kg  over  2  hour  infusion  in  the 
CPT-MS-08 report, and 2 to 14 mg/kg over 5 minute infusion in the CPT-MS-08 addendum, for MIC value of 
0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/L. Simulations for paediatric subjects with moderate and severe renal 
functions were also available in the CPT-MS-08 report and addendum.

For paediatric patients ≤2 years old, the renal maturation function (fractional change in clearance due to 
maturation  (FPMA))  was  adjusted  to  allow  for  the  simulation  of  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  renal 
impairment. The FPMA was scaled from 0.625 (50/80) to 0.988 (79/80) for mild renal impairment, 0.375 
(30/80) to 0.613 (49/80) for moderate renal impairment, and 0.125 (10/80) to 0.363 (29/80) for severe 
renal impairment. (The divisor for the scaling was set to 80 because this represents the lowest nCRCL that 
was classified as normal renal function. The dividend for the scaling was set to the upper and lower bounds 
of creatinine clearance denoting mild (50/80–79/80), moderate (30/80–49/80), and severe (10/80–29/80) 
renal impairment.) This resulted in paediatric patients ≤2 years old that had the same renal maturation 
pattern  with  respect  to  PMA  as  those  with  normal  renal  function  but  a  lower  fractional  increase  in  renal 
function due to maturation at any given value of PMA. To support the dosing regimens for neonates and 
young  infants  up  to  2  months  of  age  with  LOS,  ceftaroline  fosamil  steady-state  PK  exposure  and  PTA 
simulations for 4 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg (maximum of 400 mg) q8h IV infusions given over 1 hour or 5 minutes 
for  subjects  with  normal  renal  function  and  mild  renal  impairment  were  summarized  from  the  previous 
reports (CPT-MS-08 and Addendum).

Considering the PK/PD target of 35% and 44% free percent of time above minimum inhibitory concentration 
(%f T>MIC) for S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, respectively, ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg administered q8h as 
a 1 hour (or a 5 minute) IV infusion in paediatric subjects aged <2 months with normal renal function or mild 
renal  impairment  would  achieve  >95%  PTA  for  an  MIC  of  up  to  2  mg/L.  The  exception  is  for  preterm 
neonates with GA 28 to <30 weeks and normal renal function receiving 6 mg/kg administered q8h as a 5 
minute IV infusion for the 35% f T>MIC with an MIC of 2 mg/L where >90% PTA would be achieved.

The median AUC24SS values in preterm neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 months with 
mild renal impairment given a dose of 6 mg/kg q8h were up to 48% higher than median AUC24SS values in 
adults with normal renal function given a dose of 600 mg q12h. The median AUC24SS values in adults with 
mild renal impairment were within approximately 25% of those in adults with normal renal function given a 
dose of 600 mg q12h. 
CHMP noted that the previous pop PK model has been updated using data from the P903-21 study. The 
updated model was also used to modify dose of ceftaroline fosamil after enrolment of first patients into the 
study C2661002. As shown by the MAH via graphical data analysis and Visual Predictive Checks, the updated 
model predicted concentrations are well overlaid with the observed sparse data samples. 
The updated model was used to simulate ceftaroline fosamil median AUCss in preterm neonates, term 
neonates and infants up to 2 months of age, the predicted PK parameters were within the range of 89% to 
118% of the adult median values. Similarly, the median %fT>MIC for MICs of 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L were 
similar to or exceeded median %fT>MIC values in adults.  
As discussed above, there was some concern that  fT>MIC values >35% for S. aureus may not be sufficient 
and the MAH was requested to perform similar simulations for relevant microorganisms with fT>MIC values 
of 60% and 100%, both for patients with normal renal function and for patients with mild renal impairment. 
In summary, a dose of ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg administered q8h as a 1 hour infusion to preterm or term 
neonates (GA: 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 months provided: 
In patients with normal renal function:

regimen of 600 mg every 12 hours (q12h) as a 1 hour infusion in patients with normal renal function), 
median ceftaroline CmaxSS that ranged from 47.5% to 67.0% of the adult median CmaxSS. 
o  >95% PTA against a PK/PD target of 60% fT>MIC for non-ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (MIC of 
0.5 mg/L) and CoNS (MIC of 1 mg/L) in children of less than 2mo of age. 
o  PTA against a PK/PD target of 100% fT>MIC for non-ESBL producing Enterobacteriaceae (MIC of 0.5

In comparison, a dose of ceftaroline fosamil 4 mg/kg administered q8h as a 1 hour infusion to preterm/term 
neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants <2 months provided: 
In patients with mild renal impairment:

In addition, a dose of ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg administered q12h as a 1 hour infusion to preterm or term 
neonates (GA: 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 months with mild renal impairment provided: 
•  Median ceftaroline AUC24SS that ranged from 88.3% to 107% of the adult median AUC24SS (adult

•  <90% PTA against a PK/PD target of 100% fT>MIC for CoNS (MIC of 1 mg/L) for all age groups. 
CHMP agreed that according to the data presented the dose 6 mg/kg q8h is adequate. It cannot be excluded 
that higher doses might be required for patients infected with microorganisms with higher MICs (similar to 
adults and older children). Simulations for microorganisms with higher MICs (2 mg/L and 4mg/L) would be 
needed in the future to have a definitive view on the matter.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This  application  contains  two  clinical  studies  and  population  PK  analysis  using  the  previously  validated 
model.  
Study  P903-21  enrolled  23  neonates  (11  preterm  GA  32  to  37  weeks  and  12  term  neonates  <28  days) 
receiving a single dose regimen of ceftaroline fosamil 8 mg/kg as a 1 hour infusion.  The young infant cohort 
in that study comprised ages >28 days to <2 years (n=12), but and did not enrol any subjects between the 
ages of >28 and <60 days. 
Study  C2661002  was  closed  prematurely,  and  at  the  time  of  early  closure  11  patients  were  enrolled, 
received study treatment, and completed the study: 4 patients were in Cohort 1 (young infants aged >28 
days to <60 days), 5 in Cohort 2 (term neonates aged 7 to <28 days), and 2 in Cohort 3 (preterm neonates, 
postmenstrual age of 28 to 41 weeks, aged 7 to <28 days).  
Both studies used a sparse sampling strategy, therefore PK parameters were not calculated for each subject 
by noncompartmental analysis. Therefore, real life sparse PK data are available from 13 (11+2) preterm 
neonates,  17  (12+5)  term  neonates,  and  4  young  infants  aged  >28  days  to  <60  days.  Considering  the 
vulnerability of the study population, the relatively rare clinical indication, and the availability of PK data in 
older infants, CHMP agreed that this approach is acceptable. 
The dosing regimen for ceftaroline fosamil (6 mg/kg q8h as a 60 [±10] minute infusion) was chosen based 
on a population PK model updated with PK data from 3 multiple-dose safety and efficacy studies in children 
aged 2 months to <18 years (Studies P903 23, P903 31 and P903 24). This model was used in Monte Carlo 
simulations to choose and justify the dose regimens for children aged 2 months to 18 years, now approved 
in the US and the EU. The same model was used to predict initial doses for children <2 months of age, 
including preterm neonates (with a postmenstrual age of 28 to 41 weeks), and later change the dose from 
4 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg in the study C2661002 via protocol edition 3.   
The ceftaroline fosamil population PK model incorporated allometric scaling for body weight and maturation 
of  renal  function.  Validity  of  the  model  was  analysed  by  graphical  data  check,  the  observed  plasma 
concentrations from the study C2661002 were overlaid with the model predicted Cmax24ss and AUC24ss. The 
model predicted Cmax24ss and AUC24ss in various age groups of neonates and infants after administration of 
ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg q8h as 1h infusion were compared with the median adult Cmax24ss and AUC24ss 
after administration of ceftaroline fosamil 600mg q12h as 1h infusion. The predicted AUC24ss parameters in 
neonates  and  infants  were  within  the  range  of  89%  to  118%  of  the  adult  median  values.  Similarly,  the 
median %fT>MIC for MICs of 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L that were similar to or exceeded median %fT>MIC values 
in adults. Similar predictions were simulated for various age groups of neonates and infants with mild renal 
impairment. The median AUC24SS values in preterm neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 
months  with  mild  renal  impairment  given  a  dose  of  6  mg/kg  q8h  were  up  to  48%  higher  than  median 
AUC24SS values in adults with normal renal function given a dose of 600 mg q12h. Based on the additional 
simulations submitted by the MAH (see above), the proposed dosing of ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/mg q8h as 
1h infusion, was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The median AUC24SS values in preterm neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 months with 
mild renal impairment given a dose of 6 mg/kg q8h were up to 48% higher than median AUC24SS values in 
adults  with  normal  renal  function  given  a  dose  of  600  mg  q12h.  Based  on  the  additional  simulations 
submitted by the MAH (see above), the proposed dosing of ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/mg q8h as 1h infusion, 
was considered acceptable by CHMP.

Study P903-26 (D3720C00009/C2661002) 
Title of Study: Open-label, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Ceftaroline fosamil in Neonates and Young Infants (7 to <60 
days) with Late-Onset Sepsis 
Methods 
The  study  design  was  open-label,  multicentre,  multi-national  and  single  treatment  arm  with  no 
randomisation. The patients enrolled were neonates and young infants with late-onset sepsis (LOS). The 
open-label design allowed for close clinical monitoring by the Investigator. Given the risk to patients and the 
severity of disease, a placebo-controlled trial was not ethically appropriate.  
The study was to be conducted in approximately 30 centres worldwide. At least 24 patients with LOS were 
to be enrolled and treated within 3 age cohorts of 8 patients each:  
Cohort 1: young infants aged >28 days to <60 days of postnatal age 
Cohort 2: term neonates (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks) aged 7 to ≤28 days of postnatal age

Cohort 3: preterm neonates (defined as gestational age ≥34 to <37 weeks) aged 7 to ≤28 days of postnatal 
age 
An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was used in this study to evaluate the safety of the 
study at periodic intervals. 
CHMP noted that a request to close this study was submitted by the MAH to the EMA through a modification 
to the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) based on the fact that there was sufficient data available to 
provide ceftaroline fosamil dosing recommendations for neonates. There was agreement from the Paediatric 
Committee with early closure of the study with the enrolment of 11 patients. Of note, the same request was 
submitted to the US FDA and was agreed upon.  
Study participants 
Eleven (11) patients were enrolled in the study and received study treatment: 4 (36.4%) patients were in 
Cohort  1  (young  infants),  5  (45.5%)  in  Cohort  2  (term  neonates),  and  2  (18.2%)  in  Cohort  3  (preterm 
neonates). All enrolled patients completed the study.  
Patients had to meet all inclusion criteria and not to meet any exclusion criteria to participate in the study. 
Main inclusion criteria 
-  Gestational age ≥34 weeks, chronological age 7 to <60 days at the time of screening. 
-  Diagnosis of sepsis within 36 hours before enrolment, defined as the presence of at least 2 clinical 
criteria and at least 1 laboratory criterion in the presence of or as a result of suspected or proven 
bacterial infection that required IV antibiotic therapy. 
- 
At  least  2  of  the  following  clinical  criteria:  hypothermia  or  fever;  bradycardia  or  tachycardia  or 
rhythm  instability;  Urine  output  0.5  to  1  mL/kg/h  OR  hypotension  OR  mottled  skin  OR  impaired 
peripheral perfusion; Petechial rash OR sclerema neonatorum; New onset or worsening of apnea 
episodes OR tachypnea episodes OR increased oxygen requirements OR requirement for ventilation 
support;  Feeding  intolerance  OR  poor  sucking  OR  abdominal  distension;  Irritability;  Lethargy; 
Hypotonia  
- 
At least 1 of the following laboratory criteria: WBC count ≤4.0 × 109/L OR ≥20.0 × 109/L; Immature 
to total neutrophil ratio >0.2; PLT count ≤100 × 109/L; CRP >15 mg/L OR procalcitonin ≥2 ng/mL; 
Hyperglycemia OR Hypoglycemia; Metabolic acidosis.  
Main exclusion criteria 
-  Refractory septic shock within 24 hours before enrolment that did not resolve after 60 minutes of 
vasopressor therapy 
-  Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as serum creatinine ≥2 times (2 ×) the upper limit of 
normal  (ULN)  for  age  OR  urine  output  <0.5  mL/kg/h  (measured  over  at  least  8  hours)  OR 
requirement for dialysis. 
During the course of the study, there were no cases of patients failing to meet all eligibility criteria. 
CHMP noted that, although there are no validated inclusion and exclusion criteria of LOS, the criteria 
selected by the applicant seem to adequately reflect a population with LOS and are considered acceptable.

Treatments 
Patients received a combination of:  
• 
• 
• 
IV ceftaroline fosamil 4 mg/kg (patients enrolled prior to amendment 2) or 6 mg/kg (after 
protocol amendment 2) IV over 60 (±10) minutes q8h (±1 hour) and  
IV ampicillin for at least 48 hours (after 48 hours, the duration of treatment with ampicillin 
was at the discretion of the Investigator), plus  
an optional aminoglycoside (gentamicin was the preferred aminoglycoside) of choice as 
empiric therapy for LOS.  
The  total  duration  of  study  therapy  was  between  48  hours  (minimum)  and  14  days  (maximum).  Three 
patients enrolled prior to amendment 2 (Protocol edition 3) received ceftaroline fosamil at a dose of 4 mg/kg 
over 60 (±10) minutes q8h (±1 hour). Remaining 8 patients received 6 mg/kg q8h ceftaroline fosamil. 
If the presence of an organism that required treatment with ampicillin could not be excluded, then the use 
of IV ampicillin for the first 48 hours was mandatory. If the results of additional microbiology, PCR or other 
investigations indicated that ampicillin during the first 48 hours of treatment was not required, then its use 
was at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Nine  (9)  of  the  11  patients  received  ampicillin  with  the  mean  duration  of  exposure  of  4.8  ±2.86  days 
(median 3.0, range 2-11 days). Patients in Cohort 1 had the shortest mean exposure (3.0 ±0.0 days), while 
mean exposure in Cohorts 2 (6.0 ±3.74 days) and 3 (5.0 ±2.83 days) was similar. 
Aminoglycoside  could  be  started  and  stopped  at  any  time  during  the  study  at  the  discretion  of  the 
Investigator. The use of an aminoglycoside was optional from Baseline through the entire study.  
Six (6) patients received aminoglycoside and the mean duration of exposure was 7.7 ±3.78 days (median 
7.5, range 3-12 days). Brulamycin, gentamycin, and tobramycin were the aminoglycosides administered to 
2 patients each.  
CHMP noted that the use of combination therapy is not ideal, but accepted in the patients with LOS. 
However, concomitant medication may affect safety profile/assessment of ceftaroline fosamil. It was also 
noted that the sample size of the study was lower than initially planned (24 vs 11, especially in cohort 3 in 
which only 2 patients out of 8 planned were recruited). And that not all patients received the dose that was 
proposed to be recommended (6 mg/kg q8h) but received 4 mg/kg q8h. In view of the above, it was agreed 
that interpretation of these data is difficult.

Baseline  microbiological  assessments  were  to  be  performed  preferably  before  any  antibiotics  were 
administered. Blood, urine, CSF and other specimens/tissue samples were collected at Baseline if clinically 
indicated and performed as part of the patient’s regular medical care. 
From Baseline through the TOC visit, blood and urine samples were to be repeated per standard of care upon 
knowledge of a positive result until sterilization was confirmed. CSF or other specimens/tissue samples were 
to be repeated per standard of care upon knowledge of a positive result.

Sample size 
The  study  was  not  powered  for  inferential  statistical  analysis.  The  planned  sample  size  (24  patients;  3 
cohorts of 8 patients each) was considered adequate to evaluate the safety of ceftaroline fosamil in neonates 
and young infants with LOS. 
Randomisation 
This study was with no randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  study  was  not  blinded.  The  Investigators,  pharmacists  or  designees,  study  centre  personnel,  and 
parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) were aware of study treatment being administered. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive  statistics  (number,  mean,  standard  deviation  [SD],  median,  minimum,  and  maximum)  is 
provided  for  continuous  variables,  and  frequency  distributions  (counts  and  percentages)  are  shown  for 
categorical variables. All variables are summarized overall and by age cohort. 
Patient  disposition  (enrolment,  discontinuations  from  the  study)  overall  and  within  each  age  cohort  is 
provided based on the ITT Analysis Set. 
Demographics (age, race, gender), medical and surgical history including antepartum/peripartum period, 
microbiological assessment of blood, CSF, urine, and other specimens or tissue samples are summarized for 
the ITT, MITT, and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets. 
Efficacy response was analysed using the ITT, MITT and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets. 
Proportions of patients with a favourable efficacy response are displayed overall and within each age cohort. 
The number and percentage of patients classified as a clinical cure at EOT and TOC are tabulated in the ITT, 
MITT and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  clinical  failure  and  with  indeterminate  clinical  response  was  calculated 
analogously.  For  the  proportion  of  patients  with  clinical  cure,  clinical  failure,  and  indeterminate, 
indeterminate or missing assessments were included in the denominator for calculation of the proportions 
for the ITT, MITT and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets.

CHMP noted that the main objective of the study was to describe safety and agreed to describing the 
observed efficacy results. It was agreed that while no efficacy conclusions can be derived from this study 
alone, based on the very small sample size, extrapolation of efficacy from adults would be according to 
existing guidelines and would be acceptable.

Conduct of the study 
Efficacy analyses were conducted in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT), modified-ITT (MITT) and Microbiological-ITT 
(Micro-ITT) Analysis Sets. The number and percentage of patients with a clinical cure, clinical failure, and 
indeterminate clinical response at EOT and TOC were tabulated overall, by baseline pathogen, and within 
each age cohort. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the observed clinical cure rate overall and within 
each cohort was constructed using the Jeffreys method. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the overall 
response excluding indeterminate responses. Microbiological outcome at EOT and TOC was summarized by 
patient and by pathogen. 
All  11  experienced  at  least  1  important  protocol  deviation.  The  most  common  protocol  deviation, 
experienced by 5 patients, was “lab not done”, followed by dosing schedule and antibiotic switch deviations, 
experienced by 4 patients each. The clinical response for the 4 patients with antibiotic switch deviations was 
considered  indeterminate,  thus  impacting  efficacy  evaluation.  None  of  the  other  investigational  product 
(IP)-related deviations had an impact on the efficacy evaluation and none were considered safety issues.

Demographics 
Table 21 Demographic Characteristics (ITT Analysis Set) 
The mean age was 30.3 ±14.8 days (median 24.0, range 12-53 days). 
Gender  across  all  cohorts  was  nearly  evenly  divided.  Ten  (10,  90.9%)  patients  were  White  (1  [9.1%] 
Hispanic or Latino), and 1 (9.1%) patient was Asian.

The length and  weight of  the patients in the ITT Analysis Set were as expected for infants in these age 
groups.  
Baseline Medical and Surgical History 
The most frequently reported medical history terms were anaemia and pyrexia, both reported for 3 (27.3%) 
patients, followed by pyelonephritis, irritability, respiratory distress, and caesarean section, all reported for 
2 (18.2%) patients. 
Baseline Microbiology 
Table 23 Summary of Baseline Pathogens (Micro-ITT Analysis Set) 
E. coli was the most commonly identified organism at Baseline within the Micro-ITT Analysis Set, identified 
in 1 blood sample, 5 urine samples and 3 “other” samples.  
The organisms identified at Baseline within the MITT Analysis Set showed a similar pattern; however, the 
number of E. coli isolates was reduced, as 2 isolates (urine, nose) were resistant to ceftaroline fosamil, and 
the E. faecalis isolates were not included because ceftaroline fosamil is not active against this organism. 
Numbers analysed 
Outcomes and estimation 
At both EOT and TOC (MITT analysis set), all patients were classified as either clinical cure (4, 50%) or 
indeterminate  (4,  50%).  The  4  patients  with  indeterminate  outcomes  had  improved  clinically  and  were 
discharged  from  the  hospital  with  standard  of  care  antibacterial  treatment.  Based  on  the  definitions  for 
clinical outcome these patients did not meet the definition for cure or failure.  
Clinical response was similar for the ITT and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets (Please refer to the Table 4.4.2-15 and 
Table 4.4.2-16). Clinical cure rates were 63.6% (7/11) and 70.0% (7/10) in the ITT and Micro-ITT Analysis 
Sets, respectively. There were no clinical failures at EOT or TOC in any analysis set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019 
Page 43/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
All patients in the MITT Analysis Set had a favourable or indeterminate microbiological response at EOT and 
TOC with the exception of 1 patient with persistent E. coli in urine at TOC (MIC = 0.12 mg/L, ESBL negative, 
clinical cure). 
Within  the  MITT  Analysis  Set,  the  per-pathogen  microbiological  response  was  favourable  for  all baseline 
pathogens with the exception of 1 E. coli at TOC (as mentioned above). 
The per-patient and per-pathogen microbiological responses were similar between the MITT and Micro-ITT 
Analysis Sets. There was an additional unfavourable microbiological response in the Micro-ITT Analysis Set 
for an E. coli with a ceftaroline fosamil MIC >32 mg/L at baseline. 
A  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  clinical  responses  was  conducted,  which  excluded  the  indeterminate  clinical 
responses.  The  results  for  the  number  of  patients  experiencing  clinical  cure  at  EOT  and  TOC  were 
unchanged; all patient were cures with no clinical failures in the MITT, ITT and Micro-ITT Analysis Sets.

a. Confidence intervals (CIs) for rates within cohort are calculated using the Jeffreys method. 
Clinical response rates by baseline pathogen were summarized for the Micro-ITT and MITT Analysis Sets. In 
the Micro-ITT Analysis Set, results at EOT were unchanged at TOC. The clinical response was cure for all 
baseline pathogens with the exception of S. agalactiae (1), E. aerogenes (1), and E. coli (1), all of which 
were  assessed  as  indeterminate.  For  these  3  pathogens,  each  patient  was  discontinued  from  study 
treatment to allow for hospital discharge, resulting in a clinical outcome of indeterminate (despite improving 
clinically). There were no clinical failures by baseline pathogen in any analysis set.

Per-patient  microbiological  response  at  EOT  and  TOC  was  categorized  as  favourable  (eradication  or 
presumed  eradication),  unfavourable  (persistence  or  presumed  persistence),  or  indeterminate.  In  the 
Micro-ITT Analysis Set, 5 (50%) patients had favourable response at TOC. Three (3) patients had a response 
of  indeterminate.  Each  of  these  3  patients  was  discontinued  from  study  treatment  to  allow  for  hospital 
discharge, resulting in a clinical outcome of indeterminate (despite improving clinically). In the absence of 
follow-up  culture  data  for  these  patients,  the  per-pathogen  response  was  indeterminate  by  definition. 
Because  the  protocol  did  not  require  that  post-baseline  cultures  be  collected,  it  is  not  unexpected  that 
patients who were improving clinically would have no follow-up culture data available. Two patients had an 
unfavourable response in the Micro-ITT Analysis Set. One of the patients with an unfavourable response had 
an E. coli at baseline in urine that was not susceptible to ceftaroline fosamil (MIC >32 mg/L), but no follow 
up urine culture was available for this patient at TOC. The other patient had and E. coli (urine, MIC = 0.12 
mg/L, ESBL negative) that was persistent at TOC. Both of the patients with unfavourable microbiological 
response were clinical cures at the EOT and TOC assessments.

Per-pathogen  microbiological  response  at  EOT  and  TOC  was  categorized  as  favourable  (eradication  or 
presumed  eradication),  unfavourable  (persistence  or  presumed  persistence),  or  indeterminate.  The 
per-pathogen microbiological response in the Micro-ITT population at TOC was favourable in all baseline 
pathogens or indeterminate response at TOC, with the exception of 2 E. coli. 
The  results  for  the  MITT  analysis  are  similar  to  the  Micro-ITT  population.  All  baseline  pathogens  had  a 
favourable or indeterminate response at TOC, with the exception of 1 E. coli. Of note, the second patient with 
unfavourable microbiological response was not included in the MITT Analysis Set because this patient had a

baseline E. coli which was resistant to ceftaroline fosamil (MIC >32 mg/L). 
Table  29  Per-pathogen  Favorable  Microbiological  Response  Rate  at  Test-of-Cure  by  Baseline 
Pathogen and Baseline Ceftaroline fosamil MIC (Micro-ITT Analysis Set) 
The  numbers  of  baseline  pathogens  by  MIC  are  low,  but  there  were  high  favourable  responses  against 
baseline  pathogens  with  low  MICs  (≤  1  mg/L).  The  per-pathogen  microbiological  response  was 
indeterminate for all baseline pathogens without favourable response, with the exception of an unfavourable 
response for 2 E. coli strains with MICs = 0.12 mg/L and >32 mg/L.  
CHMP noted again that, due to the much smaller size of the study than planned (24 vs 11 subjects) due to 
the fact that ceftaroline fosamil was given in 2 dosages – 4 mg/kg q8h (3 patients) and 6 mg/kg q8h and 
because not all subjects could be evaluated (out of 11 patients 4 discontinued the study prematurely leaving 
only 7 patients (2 in cohort 1, 3 in cohort 2 and 2 in cohort 3) fully evaluable) results are difficult to 
interpreted.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
According to existing guidelines, no appropriately powered efficacy studies are requested in children from 
birth to less than 2 months of age, as efficacy can be extrapolated from adults and older children provided 
that  similar  exposure  is  achieved  in  this  paediatric  age  group.  The  applicant  conducted  one  study  that 
included  patients  with  late  onset  neonatal  sepsis  (LOS).  In  total  11  term  and  preterm  neonates  were 
included. The study population was heterogeneous and only 2 patients were born prematurely. The study 
was planned to enrol 24 patients (aged 28 to <60 days, term neonates with GA >37 weeks and PNA <28 
days, and preterm neonates with GA 32-37 weeks and PNA <28 days). The study was stopped prematurely 
after it had recruited 11 subjects- 4, 5 and 2, respectively. 3 patients received ceftaroline fosamil at doses 
of  4  mg/kg  q8h  and  remaining  8  patients  received  doses  of  6  mg/kg  q8h.  The  final  dataset  included  7 
patients as 4 patients discontinued treatment prematurely. This very small dataset does not allow drawing 
any  meaningful  conclusion  on  efficacy  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  neonates  and  young  infants  with  LOS.  It 
should be noted that LOS is not an indication proposed for this application, in which the MAH is not seeking 
an approval of a new indication. 
Noting that there were no efficacy data generated in patients aged from birth to less than two months of age 
with cSSTI or CAP, CHMP agreed that, based on the similar exposure achieved, efficacy of ceftaroline in the 
proposed indications can be extrapolated from adults and from older paediatric age groups. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
CHMP agreed that, based on the similar exposure achieved, efficacy of ceftaroline in the proposed 
indications can be extrapolated from adults and from older paediatric age groups.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Ceftaroline  fosamil  is  a  cephalosporin,  which  has  antibacterial  activity  against  aerobic  and  anaerobic 
Gram-positive  (including  MRSA,  VISA,  methicillin  resistant  coagulase  negative  staphylococci,  and  drug 
resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae) and common Gram-negative organisms (such as Escherichia coli and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, although its activity is restricted to strains that do not produce ESBL). Ceftaroline 
fosamil is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermenters. Similar to other β-lactam 
antibiotics, ceftaroline fosamil’s bactericidal mode of action involves targeting penicillin-binding proteins to 
inhibit biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. 
Important  identified  risks,  as  per  Summary  of  safety  concerns  in  the  RMP,  for  ceftaroline  fosamil  are 
Clostridium  difficile-associated  diarrhoea  (CDAD)  and  hypersensitivity/  anaphylaxis;  important  potential 
risks  are  bacterial  resistance  development,  convulsions/  seizures,  drug-induced  liver  injury  (DILI), 
haemolytic anaemia, renal impairment (including potential drug interactions with nephrotoxic agents), and 
potential for off-label use.  
Coombs seroconversion is a well-characterized side effect of the cephalosporin class and has been observed 
in higher frequency in adults and children after ceftaroline fosamil administration. The incidence was higher 
in  adult  patients  who  received  600  mg  q8h  as  compared  to  those  receiving  600  mg  q12h.  However, 
haemolytic anaemia was not observed. 
Missing  information,  as  per  Summary  of  safety  concerns  in  the  RMP,  includes  immunocompromised 
population, lactation, paediatric population exposure, pre-existing seizure disorder, pre-existing significant 
hepatic disease, pregnancy exposure and efficacy in MRSA community acquired pneumonia (CAP).  
Patient exposure 
The  summary  of  safety  data  for  ceftaroline  fosamil  includes  data  from  2  studies:  Study  D3720C00006 
(P903-21, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety and tolerability IV ceftaroline 
fosamil) and Study D3720C00009 (C2661002, multiple-dose study to assess the safety and tolerability, PK 
and efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil and ampicillin, plus an optional aminoglycoside in neonates and young 
infants with LOS).

Ceftaroline fosamil was to be given as a single IV infusion at the following doses: 
-  Cohort 1: 10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg for subjects ≥ 60 kg) as a 1-hour infusion 
-  Cohort 2: 15 mg/kg as a 1.5-hour infusion 
-  Cohort 3: ≥ 5 months: 12 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion; < 5 months: 8 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion 
-  Cohort 4 and Cohort 5: 8 mg/kg as a 1-hour infusion 
Patients were administered study drug on Day 1, the EOT Visit was on Day 2, and the F/U Evaluation visit 
was on Day 4 (±1 day). 
Fifty-two (52) subjects completed the study and 1 subject was lost to follow-up, which was considered a 
premature discontinuation from the study. 
ITT population consisted of all enrolled subjects. Summaries of subject disposition were conducted using 
the ITT Population.  
The  Safety  Population  consisted  of  all  subjects  who  received  any  amount  of  ceftaroline  fosamil.  All 
demographic and safety summaries were conducted using the Safety Population.  
The PK Population consisted of subjects who received the entire 60-minute ceftaroline fosamil infusion on 
Study Day 1 and from whom any scheduled PK samples were obtained.  
All 53 subjects were included in each population. 
The  main  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  single-dose  PK  profile,  safety,  and  tolerability  of 
ceftaroline fosamil administered by IV infusion in children ages ranging from birth to younger than 12 years 
who were receiving systemic antibiotic therapy for suspected or confirmed infection. Plasma concentrations 
of ceftaroline fosamil, ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug), and ceftaroline fosamil M-1 (inactive metabolite) were 
reported. Safety outcome measures included AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, clinical laboratory 
parameters (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, chemistry panel), vital signs, and pain scale 
parameters).

Table 34 Summary of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics by Cohort Substrata (Cohorts 
3, 4, and 5 only)—Safety Population 
CHMP noted that study D3720C00006 (P903-21) was a single dose PK study that also included patients 
appropriate  for  this  application.  From  the  data  initially  presented  by  the  MAH  it  was  unclear  how  many 
patients were at age 0 to <2 months and CHMP asked for a clarification during the assessment. The MAH 
clarified that a total of 34 infants aged <60 days received ceftaroline fosamil as study treatment and were 
evaluated for safety (4 infants aged >28 to<60, 17 infants term, aged <28, 13 infants preterm, aged <28 
days). Of 34 infnants, 11 received multiple doses of ceftaroline fosamil and 23 received a single dose. 
Though the number of patients aged <60 days was small, the incidence of TEAE in SOC Blood and lymphatic 
systems disorders, Hepatobiliary disorders and Investigations  was numerically higher in infants <60 days 
compared to older age groups. 6 patients (5 [9.4%] in P903-21 and 1 [9.1%] in D3720C00009) had 8 PCS 
laboratory abnormalities which were all assessed by the Investigator as unrelated to study treatment.  
In  multidose  study  D3720C00009  with  11  patients  there  was  only  1  serious  AE  (Salmonellosis),  which 
started  21  days  after  last  dose  of  ceftaroline  and  was  assessed  as  unrelated  to  study  treatment  by  the 
Investigator.  
CHMP agreed that based on the additional information, there were no additional specific safety concerns. 
Study  D3720C00009  (C2661002):  The  study  was  to  be  conducted  in  approximately  30  centres 
worldwide. At least 24 patients with late-onset sepsis (LOS) were to be enrolled and treated within 3 age 
cohorts  of  8  patients  each.  11  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  study  and  received  study  treatment  with 
ceftaroline fosamil. 
Cohort 1: young infants aged >28 days to <60 days (4 patients) 
Cohort 2: term neonates (defined as gestational age ≥37 weeks) aged 7 to ≤28 days (5 patients) 
Cohort 3: preterm neonates (defined as gestational age ≥34 to <37 weeks) aged 7 to ≤28 days (2 patients) 
Patients received a combination of IV ceftaroline fosamil and ampicillin, plus an optional aminoglycoside of 
choice  as  empiric  therapy  for  LOS.  The  total  duration  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  treatment  was  48  hours 
(minimum)  to  14  days  (maximum).  Hospitalization  was  required  during  IV  study  treatment.  Patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019 
Page 55/74 
 
  
  
 
 
received ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg as a 60-minute (±10 min) infusion q8h (±1 hour). Patients treated 
prior  to  protocol  amendment  2  were  dosed  with  ceftaroline  fosamil  4  mg/kg  as  a  60  minute  (±10  min) 
infusion every 8 hours (q8h) (±1 hour). 
If the presence of an organism that required treatment with ampicillin could not be excluded, the use of IV 
ampicillin  for  the  first  48  hours  was  mandatory.  If  the  results  of  additional  microbiology,  PCR  or  other 
investigations indicated that ampicillin during the first 48 hours of treatment was not required, then its use 
was  at  the  discretion  of  the  Investigator.  The  use  of  an  aminoglycoside  was  considered  optional  from 
Baseline through the entire study and could be started and stopped at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Patients participated in the study for up to 49 days. The Safety Follow up (SFU) visit occurred 21 to 35 days 
after the last dose of study treatment. 
All  enrolled  patients  completed  the  study.  The  4  (36.4%)  patients  who  were  discontinued  from  study 
treatment had improved to the extent that a switch to other standard of care oral/IV antibacterial therapy 
was made so that discharge from the hospital was possible. 
Evaluating the safety and tolerability of ceftaroline fosamil for the treatment of LOS in neonates and young 
infants aged 7 to <60 days was a primary objective, and all safety analyses were performed on the Safety 
Analysis Set. Outcome measures included AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, clinical laboratory 
parameters (eg, complete blood count [CBC] with differential, chemistry panel), and vital signs. 
An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was used in this study to monitor the safety of the 
study at periodic intervals. DSMB members were familiar with AEs and SAEs likely to occur in this patient 
population, based on experience in adults and children older than 2 months of age, as well as with this class 
of drugs (cephalosporins). During the study, the DSMB conducted pre-planned reviews of accumulated data. 
Over the course of the study, the only recommendation from the DSMB was to continue the study without 
modification. 
As  per  the  protocol,  the  duration  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  therapy  was  48  hours  (minimum)  up  to  14  days 
(maximum). Across all patients in the Safety Analysis Set, the mean duration of ceftaroline fosamil exposure 
was  8.5  ±3.53  days  (median  8.0  days,  range  3-15  days).  Mean  duration  of  exposure  in  the  individual 
cohorts was similar. 
Nine (9) of the 11 patients in the study received ampicillin and the mean duration of exposure was 4.8 ±2.86 
days (median 3.0, range 2-11 days). Patients in Cohort 1 had the shortest mean exposure (3.0 ±0.0 days), 
while mean exposure in Cohorts 2 (6.0 ±3.74 days) and 3 (5.0 ±2.83 days) was similar.  
The use of an aminoglycoside was optional from Baseline through the entire study. Six (6) patients received 
aminoglycoside and the mean duration of exposure was 7.7 ±3.78 days (median 7.5, range 3-12 days). 
Brulamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin were the aminoglycosides administered to 2 patients each.  
Please refer to the Table 4.4.2-10 (p 48) for demographic characteristics of ITT analysis set.  
Across all patients, the mean age was 30.3 ±14.8 days (median 24.0, range 12-53 days). 
Gender across all cohorts was nearly evenly divided, with 5 (45.5%) females and 6 (54.5%) males, although 
the distribution varied by cohort. Ten (10, 90.9%) patients were White (1 [9.1%] Hispanic or Latino), and 1 
(9.1%) patient was Asian.  
The length and  weight of  the patients in the ITT Analysis Set were as expected for infants in these age 
groups.  
Baseline Medical and Surgical History 
The most frequently reported medical history terms were anaemia and pyrexia, both reported for 3 (27.3%) 
patients, followed by pyelonephritis, irritability, respiratory distress, and caesarean section, all reported for 
Assessment report

2 (18.2%) patients.  
Relevant surgical history was only recorded for 1 patient (Cohort 1) who had a thoracostomy prior to study 
entry.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 
AEs that occurred from the signing of the informed consent form through the F/U Evaluation were collected. 
All unresolved AEs and SAEs, and any spontaneously reported up through 14 days (Study Day 15) after 
ceftaroline fosamil administration, were followed by the study staff for resolution or stabilization. 
Safety  evaluations  were  conducted  in  the  Safety  Population  (all  patients  who  received  any  amount  of 
ceftaroline  fosamil).  The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  was  presented  by  system  organ 
class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to the MedDRA®, version 15.1, relationship to ceftaroline 
fosamil, and severity. Descriptive statistics of clinical laboratory results and the change from baseline were 
presented as well as a summary of potentially clinically significant (PCS) laboratory abnormalities. 
This was an exploratory study and was therefore not powered for inferential statistical analyses. 
Common AEs

A  total  of  44  AEs  were  reported  in  23  (43.4%)  patients.  The  most  common  TEAEs  overall  were  ALT 
increased,  AST  increased,  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK)  increased,  blood  lactate  dehydrogenase 
(LDH) increased, and prothrombin time prolonged (2 subjects each). 
Most  TEAEs  were  mild  (56.8%)  or  moderate  (31.8%)  in  severity,  and  only  5  (11.4%)  TEAEs  were 
Assessment report

determined  to  be  severe  in  intensity  by  the  Investigator.  Out  of  the  44  AEs,  4  (9.1%)  events  were 
considered to be related to treatment by the Investigator. 
There were no deaths among patients who participated in this study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Three (3) SAEs were reported in 3 (5.7%) subjects in the study (Subject 01121005, Cohort 1: rash; Subject 
02021003, Cohort 3: tremor; Subject 01021004, Cohort 5: anaemia neonatal). All SAEs were resolved and 
did not result in discontinuation from the study. Subject 02021003 (Cohort 3) was a 20-month-old white 
male, out of the range of age of interest for the current procedure.  
Subject 01021004 (Cohort 5) was a 9-day-old white Hispanic female of a gestational age of 36 weeks who 
experienced a mild SAE of anaemia neonatal (ie, anaemia of prematurity) on Study Day 2 (1 day after study 
infusion).  Medical  history  included  anaemia,  bilateral  Grade  1  hydronephrosis,  hypoalbuminemia, 
hypovolemia,  and  status  post  gastroschisis  closure.  She  was  treated  with  ampicillin  and  gentamicin  for 
suspected  neonatal  sepsis.  She  was  treated  with  packed  RBCs  for  the  anaemia.  On  Study  Day  2,  her 
haematocrit and haemoglobin levels dropped and she received another treatment with packed RBCs. This 
was considered clinically significant, and per the Investigator, the study required blood draws that may have 
contributed to the decrease. The event was not considered study drug related. To prevent additional blood 
loss,  no  additional  haematology  testing  was  ordered  at  that  time;  however,  on  Study  Day  13,  her 
haemoglobin and haematocrit levels decreased again. The subject continued to receive additional packed 
RBCs during the following month. The subject recovered from the SAE of anaemia neonatal on Study Day 47.

Out of the 44 AEs, 4 (9.1%) events were considered to be related to treatment by the Investigator (Subject 
01121005,  Cohort  1:  infusion  site  pain;  Subject  01521001,  Cohort  1:  abdominal  pain,  nausea;  Subject 
01721003, Cohort 5: neutrophil count decreased).  
Neutrophil  count  decrease  in  Subject  01721003  in  Cohort  5  (preterm  (gestational  age  32-37  weeks) 
neonates  <28  days))  was  considered treatment  related  by  the  Investigator.  The  patient  was  7  days  old 
male, Neutrophils Absolute Cell Count 2.83x109/L (25%). Subject 01721003 in Cohort 5 had an unusually 
high ceftaroline fosamil concentration in the plasma sample taken 3 to 4 hours after the end of infusion. 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment.  
Study D3720C00006 (P903-21) was a single dose study – no dose reductions due to AEs.  
CHMP noted that all the reported AEs related to study drug are listed ADRs: Infusion site pain, abdominal 
pain and nausea are common ADRs and Neutropenia is uncommon ADR. The data from Study D3720C00006 
(P903-21) correspond to the known safety profile of ceftaroline fosamil.  
Study D3720C00009 (C2661002) 
AEs were reviewed at Baseline, throughout the treatment period, and at EOT, TOC, and SFU.  
Safety  evaluations  were  conducted  in  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  (patients  who  received  any  amount  of 
ceftaroline  fosamil).  The  number  and  percentage  of  patients  with  AEs  occurring  after  the  start  of 
administration of the first dose of study therapy, including AEs that started prior to treatment and worsened 
on  treatment,  up  to  the  SFU  visit  are  summarized  for  the  Safety  Analysis  Set.  Descriptive  statistics 
(including n, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum) of observed results (eg, laboratory data and vital 
signs) and change from baseline were presented for continuous results by age cohort and overall for the 
Safety  Analysis  Set.  The  study  was  not  powered  for  inferential  statistical  analysis  and  was  intended  to 
provide descriptive statistics only. 
Common AEs

Page 59/74 
 
  
  
Table 36 Treatment-Emergent AEs, by System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
A total of 10 AEs were reported in 5 (45.5%) patients. Diarrhoea was reported for 2 patients, while all other 
reported AEs were reported for 1 patient each. Of the 10 AEs reported, all except 1 were mild in severity. 
One severe AE, salmonellosis, was experienced by a patient in Cohort 3; this was an SAE.  
Out of the 10 AEs, only 1 event, diarrhoea, was assessed by the Investigator as related to study treatment. 
This event of diarrhoea was mild in severity and was resolved. No action was taken in regards to the study 
treatment.  
There were no deaths among patients who participated in this study. 
CHMP noted that diarrhoea is one of the most common ADR of ceftaroline fosamil. Out of the 10 AEs, only 1 
event, diarrhoea, was assessed by the Investigator as related to study treatment. The numbers are very 
small and thus not conclusive. 
Still TEAE were more common in cohort 4 and cohort 5 as compared to cohort 1 and cohort 2 in study 
P903-21. The reasons for that were not entirely elucidated. 
In a multiple dose study almost a half of patients (45.5%) had TEAE; the rate is very similar with older 
children who received ceftaroline fosamil for treatment of cSSTI (48%) (The Pediatric Infectious Disease 
Journal: August 2016 - Volume 35 - Issue 8 - p e239–e247).  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
One SAE, salmonellosis, was reported for 1 (9.1%) patient in Cohort 3.  
The SAE started on Day 29 (21 days after last dose of ceftaroline fosamil), was severe, resolved and was 
considered  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  This  AE  does  not  raise  any  additional  safety  issues  related  to 
ceftaroline fosamil treatment.

Adverse Events Related to Study Drug 
The single AE deemed related to study drug, diarrhoea, is a recognized side-effect of ceftaroline fosamil 
treatment and is listed in the prescribing information as occurring in ≥3% of patients treated with ceftaroline 
fosamil. This AE does not raise any additional safety issues related to ceftaroline fosamil treatment. 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. 
There were no AEs leading to dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of study treatment.  
CHMP agreed that, according to the results of this very small study, the safety profile of ceftaroline fosamil 
remains unchanged. 
Laboratory findings 
As  per  the  protocols  for  both  Study  D3720C00006  (P903-21)  and  Study  D3720C00009  (C2661002), 
haematology,  chemistry,  and  urinalysis  were  collected  at  Baseline  and  EOT;  additional  samples  were 
collected as clinically indicated. Given the limited time points when laboratory assessments were required by 
the protocol, the ability to make conclusions related to laboratory results is limited. 
Study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 
For each of the clinical laboratory parameters, mean changes from Baseline were small and considered not 
clinically meaningful.  
In  amendment  2  (12  Jul  2011) of  the  study  was  removed  references  to  Coombs  tests  (except  from the 
Summary of Known and Potential Risks Section of the protocol), as these tests were not required; added the 
instruction to perform a workup for haemolytic anaemia per standard of care should a subject’s haemoglobin 
or  haematocrit  decrease  significantly  (in  the  Investigator’s  judgment)  after  administration  of  ceftaroline 
fosamil; and added haemolytic anaemia to the nonexclusive list of categories of safety data to be monitored.  
Cephalosporins  are  known  to  be  associated  with  positive  direct  Coombs  test  results.  Although  rates  of 
seroconversion from a negative to a positive direct Coombs test in the pooled data from Phase 3 cSSSI and 
CAP studies were higher in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with the comparator groups (10.7% vs 
4.4%,  respectively)  this  was  within  the  expected  range  of  Coombs  seroconversion  associated  with 
cephalosporins, and no subject was identified with clinical findings or laboratory results that were consistent 
with haemolytic anaemia. 
For  each  of  the  clinical  laboratory  parameters  shifts  (from  Baseline  to  EOT  relative  to  individual  normal 
ranges in haematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation parameters) were infrequent and consistent with 
the underlying infection of each subject.

Individual Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities 
The  incidence  of  potentially  clinically  significant  (PCS)  laboratory  abnormalities  was  generally  low.  Five 
(9.4%) subjects (Cohorts 4 and 5) had 7 PCS laboratory abnormalities. All PCS laboratory abnormalities that 
were reported as AEs were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator.  
Subject 01121013 (Cohort 4) had ALT and AST elevations at EOT/Study Day 2 that met PCS criteria. The 
subject's baseline AST value was high, but did not meet PCS criteria. In addition, the subject had AEs of 
severe  blood  LDH  increased,  moderate  coagulopathy  (elevated  INR),  and  moderate  prothrombin  time 
prolonged, all at EOT/Study Day 2. All AEs were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator and 
with the exception of blood LDH increased, all were resolved. 
Subject 01121015 (Cohort 4) had AST and CPK elevations at EOT/Study Day 2 that met PCS criteria. These 
abnormalities were reported as severe AEs on Study Day 2. In addition, the subject had severe AEs of ALT 
increased and blood LDH increased, both reported on Study Day 2. All AEs were considered not related to 
study drug by the Investigator and were ongoing at the time of study completion. 
Subject 02221006 (Cohort 4) had a high absolute neutrophil count at baseline, he had decrease in absolute 
neutrophil count at EOT/Study Day 2 that met PCS criteria. Other laboratory abnormalities included high 
absolute basophil count at Baseline, high absolute eosinophil count at EOT, low absolute lymphocyte count 
at  EOT,  high  absolute  monocyte  count  at  Baseline  and  EOT,  low  blood  LDH  at  Baseline  and  EOT,  high 
phosphorus  at  EOT,  and  high  total  bilirubin  at  Baseline  and  EOT.  Medical  history  included  ongoing 
meningitis, sepsis, neutrophilia, and hyperbilirubinemia; and resolved respiratory distress. He was treated 
with ampicillin, gentamicin, and penicillin for the infections. No AEs were reported for this subject. 
Subject 01021003 (Cohort 5) had decreased haematocrit at Baseline/Study Day 1 and EOT/Study Day 2. 
The subject also had 2 separate AEs of respiratory acidosis, both at EOT/Study Day 2, which were considered 
to be mild and not related to the study drug by the Investigator and were resolved. A decrease in RBC count 
from Baseline met PCS criteria at EOT. Because the child was anaemic prior to study entry, this was not 
reported as an AE by the Investigator. 
Subject  01521006  (Cohort  5)  had  a  decrease  in  percent  neutrophils  at  EOT/Study  Day  2  that  met  PCS 
Assessment report

criteria. However, the subject was neutropenic at Baseline. A mild AE of candidiasis was also reported at 
EOT. The AE was considered not related to the study drug by the Investigator and was ongoing at the time 
of study completion. 
Elevated post-baseline chemistry values for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and laboratory criteria for potential 
Hy’s  law  were  assessed  by  cohort.  Elevated  liver  chemistry  values  were  reported  in  3  subjects  (ALT,  1 
subject;  AST,  2  subjects;  total  bilirubin,  1  subject)  were  reported  in  Cohort  4.  After  clinical  review,  no 
subjects met potential Hy’s law criteria. 
CHMP noted that increased transaminases are known ADRs in Hepatobiliary disorders SOC with frequency of 
common for ceftaroline fosamil. This study was SD study and included patients of age up to 12 years. During 
the assessment the MAH also provided some data for the age group of interest (less than 60 days), which did 
not lead to additional safety concerns. CHMP also noted that, similar to other TEAE they were more common 
in cohort 4 and 5 as compared to cohort 1 and cohort 2 – 60% of TEAE occurred in 2 former cohort while only 
43% of patients were included to those two cohorts. 
Study D3720C00009 (C2661002) 
There were 5 patients with changes in chemistry values and 7 patients with changes in hematology values. 
None  of  these  changes  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  clinically  significant  and  no  AE  was 
reported. There were no changes in laboratory values for any patient between Baseline and the laboratory 
tests done at SFU.  
Individual Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities 
A single laboratory value considered to be potentially clinically significant was reported during the study. The 
hematocrit (ratio) value for 1 patient in Cohort 3 (Male, aged 19 days) at TOC (Day 19) had dropped to 0.237 
from a Baseline (Day -2) value of 0.360.  
An AE of anaemia was reported, mild in severity, and considered unrelated to study treatment. On Day 47, 
hematocrit (ratio) had increased to 0.271. The outcome of the AE was reported as recovering/resolving. The 
anaemia  was  mild  in  severity,  but  there  is  no  information  available  about  the  Coombs  test.  Generally 
anaemia is a listed ADR for Ceftaroline fosamil, but in this case it was considered unrelated to the study drug.  
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety  
Study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 
Patients’ vital signs were monitored throughout the study. 
Vital signs and pain scale assessments were similar at end of therapy (EOT) in comparison to baseline.

Slight improvements in pain scale evaluations at EOT were noted in all cohorts. These improvements were 
most likely related to the overall improvement of the underlying infection. 
No other clinically significant safety observations were noted. 
Study D3720C00009 (C2661002) 
Patients’ vital signs were monitored throughout the study. 
In regards to physical exam, only a single clinically significant change from Baseline was noted: dermatitis 
was reported as an AE, mild in severity, onset Day 5, resolved.  
No other clinically significant safety observations were noted. 
CHMP agreed that the safety profile of ceftaroline fosamil remained unchanged based on the data from 
studies D3720C00009 (C2661002) and D3720C00006 (P903-21). It was noted that the use of ceftaroline 
fosamil in paediatric population aged <2 mo is very limited, but the safety profile in children was similar to 
that observed in the adult population.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the study D3720C00006 (P903-21) 52 subjects completed the study and 1 subject was lost to follow-up 
and considered as a premature discontinuation from the study. There were no premature discontinuations 
due to an AE.  
There were neither deaths nor AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in the study D3720C00009 
(C2661002).  The  4  (36.4%)  patients  who  were  discontinued  from  study  treatment  had  improved to the 
extent that discharge from the hospital was desired.  
Post marketing experience 
Forest Laboratories received US NDA approval from the FDA on 29 October 2010 under the brand name 
TEFLARO, which was the first approval worldwide. TEFLARO was launched in the US on 03 January 2011.

The exposure tables are based on the number of vials sold available from January 2011 to June 2018. 
The European Commission granted marketing approval (Centralised Procedure) for ceftaroline fosamil on 23 
August  2012  under  the  brand  name  ZINFORO.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  has  been  approved  in  69  countries 
worldwide under the brand name ZINFORO. 
The exposure tables are based on the number of vials sold from post-approval date 23 August 2012 to June 
2018. 
It is estimated that approximately 615,450 patients, equivalent to 12,260 patient-years, were exposed to 
ceftaroline fosamil worldwide since the product was first approved. The estimated patient exposure is based 
on worldwide sales of 8,616,304 vials containing 600 mg of ceftaroline fosamil and on the assumption that 
the average dose and duration of ceftaroline fosamil treatment is 600 mg every 12 hours for 7 days (equals 
fourteen 600 mg vials) in adults with normal renal function across all approved indications. 
Table 39. Cumulative Estimated Exposure by Region

AEs in Post-Marketing Experience 
A cumulative search of post marketing paediatric AE reports was conducted through 30 June 2018. 
Thirty-six (36) events included in 19 individual case safety reports (ICSR) were identified, of which one (1) 
originated in a European Union Member state (France) and the remaining 18 concern patients in the US (11), 
Argentina (2), Australia (2), Malaysia, Mexico and South Africa (1 each). 
The ICSRs concerned 2 children 4 to 9 years old and 15 paediatric patients 10 to 17 years old. Age was not 
provided in 2 ICSRs. 
The most frequently reported PTs (≥2) were Off label use (5), Product use issue (3), Neutropenia (2), Drug 
ineffective (2), Drug administered to patient of inappropriate age (2), Product use in unapproved indication 
(2) and Rash (2).

Seven  cases  were  reported  as  serious,  2012SE95404  reporting  eosinophilia,  2014SE39478  reporting 
neutropenia, anaemia and off label use (CF exacerbation, MRSA and pneumonia), 2015SF05601 reporting 
seizure, 2017374644 reporting neutropenia, drug ineffective for unapproved indication (failure of treatment 
after  1  year/product  was  indicated  for  bone  and  joint  infections)  and  product  use  issue  (patient  was 
administered with 600 mg three times a day), 2018079133 reporting febrile neutropenia, agranulocytosis, 
rash papular and rash erythematous, 2018111011 reporting pancytopenia and product use in unapproved 
indication (culture-negative osteomyelitis) and 2018263754 reporting meningitis pneumococcal. 
The  reported  post  marketing  paediatric  AEs  are  consistent  with  safety  data  and  ADRs  included  in  the 
ceftaroline  fosamil  SmPC.  No  new  safety  concerns  with  regard  to  the  use  of  ceftaroline  fosamil  in  this 
population have been identified from assessment of these cases. The MAH will continue to review the safety 
of ceftaroline fosamil, including all reports of adverse experiences and will revise the product documents if 
an evaluation of the safety data yields significant new information. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant has conducted two studies that included patients relevant for this application. Study P903-21 
was a single dose PK study that recruited 11 preterm and 12 term neonates. There might have been more 
patients aged below 2 months in cohort 3 but this has not been reported separately. The other study was a 
single arm MD study in patients aged <2 months with LOS.  Ceftaroline fosamil was given in 2 doses (4 
mg/kg q8h for 3 patients and 6 mg/kg q8h for remaining 8 patients) in multiple dose study while a dose of 
8 mg/kg was used in a SD study for term and preterm neonate cohorts. Most patients received ceftaroline 
fosamil in combination with other antibiotics in MD study. The latter study was planned to enrol 24 subjects 
equally distributed between premature, term babies aged <28 days and those aged between 28 and 60 
days. The study, however, was prematurely discontinued due to MAH opinion that there was sufficient data 
available to provide ceftaroline fosamil dosing recommendations for neonates and that standard practice has 
changed to minimise intravenous antibiotics. Thus the study only recruited 11 patients. The small sample 
size,  very  low  number  of  premature  babies,  heterogenous  population  in  multiple  dose  study  and  use  of 
concomitant antibiotics do not allow drawing firm conclusions. As much as one can observe from this limited 
dataset no new safety concerns were raised. In addition, in both studies the majority of AEs were mild to 
moderate and non-serious, there were no AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug, there were no death, 
for all laboratory parameters mean changes from screening were small and clinically not significant. Some of 
the class effects of cephalosporins (e.g. Clostridium difficile colitis, seizures) cannot be evaluated due either 
because of different pathomechanims (CID colitis) or small sample size (seizures).  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
CHMP agreed that the safety dataset was very limited (23 patients in a SD study and 11 patients in a MD 
study). In addition the population was heterogeneous. No new safety concerns were observed.  
The majority of AEs were mild to moderate and non-serious, there were no AEs that led to discontinuation of 
study drug, there were no death, for all laboratory parameters mean changes from screening were small and 
clinically not significant.  
Some of the class effects of cephalosporins (e.g. Clostridium difficile colitis, seizures) could not be evaluated

due either because of different pato-mechanims (CID colitis) or small sample size (seizures).  
In addition, CHMP requests that the MAH should submit the following safety data in next PSUR: a detailed 
review of all neonatal cases. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 18.1 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex 
I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted 
to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 18.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
See full changes to the Product Information in the attached Appendix. As a consequence of this new 
indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: there have been 
no significant changes to the package leaflet to warrant a readability test to be included with this submission. 
In  accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  as  amended  a  readability  test  is 
carried out at the next substantial change.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Ceftaroline fosamil is a beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by binding to 
one or more penicillin-binding proteins (PBP). As a results built up of bacterial cell wall is disturbed and that 
lead to cell death. Ceftaroline fosamil exhibits unique properties that distinguish it from other β-lactams due 
to its high affinity for PBP2a in MRSA and PBP2x in PRSP that contribute to its potent antibacterial activity 
against these organisms. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ceftaroline fosamil is approved for adults and children above 2 months of age for treatment of cSSTI and 
community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). This is an extension of indication application aiming to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/455556/2019

include  paediatric  patients  from  birth  to  less  than  2  months  and  also  to  include  subsequent  dosing 
recommendations for the proposed paediatric population for the treatment of cSSTI and CABP. 
These indications, approved in adults and older children, are extremely rare in neonates and young infants 
(age ≤ 2 mo) as generalised rather than local disease is characteristic for this age group. The causative 
agents of cSSTI are likely to be similar in older children and neonates although well conducted studies are 
largely missing. With regards to community acquired pneumonia (CAP), the frequency of causative agents 
may  differ  in  older  children  and  adults  vs  neonates.  While  Group  B  streptococci  (GBS)  and  S.aureus 
predominate and S.pneumoniae is very rare in neonates, the latter is the most common in older children and 
adults.   
Late-onset sepsis (LOS) is still one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in developing 
but also in highly developed countries. The most affected populations are premature or extremely premature 
neonates. Mortality rate varies form 6-8% in highly developed countries up to 30% in developing world. 
Furthermore, even if the babies survive they may suffer from long-term side effects such as developmental 
delay, motor defects or seizures. LOS is predominantly caused by coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) 
(36-66% of cases), other organisms such as S.aureus and Gram-negative rods account for about 26-36% of 
cases (Hornick et al. 2012; Cohen-Wolkowiez et al. 2009). This indication is not applied for in this 
application. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  early  use  of  antibiotic  regimens  remains  the  cornerstone  for  the  treatment  of  CAP  and  cSSTI.  It  is 
characteristic for neonatal population that systemic antibiotics will be used in hospitalised children even if 
they do not full-fill all the criteria of cSSTI used in adults and older children. There is no specific treatment 
guidelines for neonates with SSTI and thus those used for treatment of older children and adults will be 
followed. Antistaphylococcal beta-lactams are most commonly recommended and used in case of methicillin 
susceptible  S.aureus  (MSSA).  Vancomycin  or  clindamycin  or  trimethoprim/sulfamethoxasol  are 
recommended if MRSA is suspected or confirmed (Clinical Infectious Diseases 2014;59(2):e10–52; Arch Dis 
Child. 2016 Jan;101(1):72-6). Surgical treatment is employed similar to adults and older children. 
For  neonatal  CAP,  ampicillin  plus  an  aminoglycoside  or  alternatively  third  generation  cephalopsorins  are 
recommended for treatment of CAP in neonates (The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal. 2012; 00:e78–
e85). In case of staphylococcal pneumonia antistaphylococcal penicillins are used. 
For LOS which was the clinical condition studied in the very small clinical study supporting this application, 
most treatment guidelines recommend using combination of the penicillins (ampicillin or penicillin G) and 
aminoglycoside  as  a  first  choice.  Broad  spectrum  antibiotics  such  as  3rd  generation  cephalosporins  or 
beta-lactam lactamase inhibitors are used in some centres. Vancomycin is often given if CoNS are suspected 
or  confirmed  because  most  CoNS  species  are  resistant  to  oxacillin  worldwide.  Vancomycin  and 
aminoglycosides, however, have safety concerns and thus require therapeutic drug monitoring, especially if 
administered to vulnerable populations such as premature neonates.  
New antibiotics effective against CoNS, S.aureus and non-ESBL producing Enterobactriaceae are especially 
needed for treatment of LOS but this is not the indication sought in this application. New antibiotics may 
have added value as alternative treatment of cSSTI and CAP but as mentioned above both diseases are rare 
in  neonates  and  infants  ages  <  2  mo.  Ceftaroline  as  an  agent  active  against  S.aureus  and  non-ESBL 
producing Enterobactriaceae is an appropriate candidate for treatment of CAP and cSSTI in this paediatric 
age group.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application aims to extend dosing recommendation to neonates and young infants aged <2 months with 
cSSTI and CAP. The applicant presents 2 studies:  one is a single-dose PK study that included 23 subjects 
(11 with GA of 32-37 weeks and 12 term babies aged <28 days). There might have been infants aged < 60 
days recruited also into 3rd cohort (infants <2 years) but these are not specifically outlined in the application. 
The  second  study  was  a  multiple  dose  safety/PK  study  that  enrolled  11  patients  aged  <60  days  with 
suspected or proven LOS. No patients with cSSTI or CAP were included in this study. Ceftaroline fosamil was 
given in different doses and often concomitantly with other antibiotics. There were 7 patients in total who 
completed the study.  
Both studies used sparse sampling methodology to evaluate PK profile of ceftaroline fosamil.  The dosing 
regimen for ceftaroline fosamil was chosen based on a population PK model updated with PK data from 3 
multiple-dose safety and efficacy studies in children aged 2 months to <18 years. The studies were sufficient 
to  define  dosing  recommendations  for  children  aged  <2  months  by  showing  similar  exposure  to  adults. 
However, in terms of efficacy in patients with LOS the study is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions; 
in addition, this indication was not applied for. The safety dataset did not reveal any new safety concerns but 
similar to efficacy results no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The model predicted Cmax24ss and AUC24ss in various age groups of neonates and infants after administration 
of ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/kg q8h as 1h infusion were compared with the median adult Cmax24ss and AUC24ss 
after administration of ceftaroline fosamil 600mg q12h as 1h infusion. The predicted AUC24ss parameters in 
neonates  and  infants  were  within  the  range  of  89%  to  118%  of  the  adult  median  values.  Similarly,  the 
median %fT>MIC for MICs of 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L that were similar to or exceeded median %fT>MIC values 
in adults. Similar predictions were simulated for various age groups of neonates and infants with mild renal 
impairment. The median AUC24SS values in preterm neonates (GA 28 to <40 weeks) and infants up to <2 
months  with  mild  renal  impairment  given  a  dose  of  6  mg/kg  q8h  were  up  to  48%  higher  than  median 
AUC24SS values in adults with normal renal function given a dose of 600 mg q12h. The proposed dosing of 
ceftaroline fosamil 6 mg/mg q8h as 1h infusion, was up to 25% higher in infants aged >2 months, but in 
infants younger than 2 months the current dosing may result in unnecessary overexposure.  
Ceftaroline fosamil was in general well tolerated, the AEs were mostly mild to moderate, none of them 
resulted in discontinuation of study drug, there were no death and no unexpected AEs were identified. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are several uncertainties with in this application: 
CoNS  may  cause  cSSTI  in  neonates  and  young  infants  but  no  in  vitro  susceptibility  data  of  CoNS  are 
presented in this application. Based on the data presented in the application, ceftaroline fosamil seemed 
equally effective against various species of CoNS, including against strains of neonatal origin. 
The  PK/PD  analysis  considered  the  PK/PD  target of  35%  and  44%  free  percent  of  time  above  minimum 
inhibitory  concentration  (%f  T>MIC)  for  S.  aureus  and  S.  pneumonia.  These  targets  were  identified  in 
preclinical studies. To address some concerns expressed during the assessment with regard to the adequacy 
of  these  PD  targets,  the  MAH  performed  simulations  using  MIC  values  of  CoNS  and  ESBL  negative 
Enterobacteriaceae by targeting greater T>MIC values (e.g. 60% fT>MIC and 100% fT>MIC). 
The applicant conducted additional analyses as requested by CHMP and the required PTA was above 90% . 
for 60% fT>MIC, which was considered acceptable by CHMP. In addition, CHMP noted that in the additional 
simulations, the MAH did not consider GA adequately. The GA was entered into simulation but it only reflects

time at birth, the time period when ceftaroline is hardly needed or administered. It cannot be excluded that 
a higher dose might be needed to treat infections produced by pathogens with higher MICs, as is the case for 
adults and older children, but this is not subject to this application. 
Despite the fact that the submitted studies did not generate conclusive efficacy data for treatment of cSSTI 
or CAP in neonates or young children, the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in this age group can be extrapolated 
from adults and older children, provided that similar exposure is achieved.  
CHMP  noted  that  this  application  did  not  seeking  approval  for  treatment  of  LOS,  a  common  neonatal 
infection for which new treatments are much needed.  
The safety database is very limited and safety data were provided for children  with LOS rather than  for 
patients with cSSTI or CAP. Furthermore the study population was very heterogeneous. There were in total 
of 23 patients aged <2 months who received single dose and 11 who received multiple dose of ceftaroline 
fosamil. Different doses of ceftaroline fosamil were used, most patients received concomitant antibiotics and 
not all patients in MD study completed study treatment. Therefore less frequent AEs like seizures are likely 
missed  and  CID  colitis  can  hardly  be  diagnosed  in  neonatal  age.  Still,  no  unexpected  side  effects  were 
identified. Furthermore, cephalosporins have been used in clinical practice for several decades including in 
neonatology. In adults the safety profile of ceftaroline fosamil is similar to other cephalosporins therefore it 
is unlikely that unexpected side effects will emerge with the inclusion of the additional population. Hence 
CHMP agreed that a  detailed review of all neonate cases should be provided in next PSUR, as it will allow a 
continued and thorough assessment. 
As in adults, there is always a risk of out-selection of resistance, especially if cephalosporins are misused 
(wrong indication or wrong dosing regimen). Thus, development of emergent resistance should be 
monitored in post marketing studies. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No new unfavourable effects were reported in the clinical studies presented in this application. The majority 
of AEs were mild to moderate and non-serious, there were no AEs that led to discontinuation of study drug, 
there were no deaths, for all laboratory parameters mean changes from screening were small and clinically 
not significant. 
3.5.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.5.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Ceftaroline  fosamil  is  an  antibiotic  that  belongs  to  the  cephalosporin  class  of  antibacterial  medicinal 
products.  Cephalosporins  have  been  in  clinical  use  for  several  decades,  including  in  the  treatment  of 
neonatal sepsis. They are effective against most microorganisms that cause cSSTI and CAP in neonates and 
young infants and are generally well tolerated.  
During this application the MAH provided the data that underpin the fact that the chosen dosing regimen that 
achieves a similar exposure in term and preterm neonates with cSSTI and CAP to that observed in adults 
(and older children). CHMP therefore agreed that safety and efficacy can be extrapolated to children from 
birth to less than 2 months of age for the dosing regimen the 6 mg/kg q8h given via 1-h infusion. 
Several uncertainties, mainly driven by relatively limited development programme, consist in the limited 
number of subjects in the safety dataset and the fact that no clinical data were generated from patients with 
cSSTI or CAP.

3.5.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There is a moderate need for the new effective and well tolerated antibiotic for neonates in treatment of 
cSSTI  and  CAP,  as  both  diseases  are  relatively  rare  in  this  population  and  mostly  covered  by  available 
antibiotics.  Ceftaroline  fosamil  is  a  cephalosporin  that  has  a  good  activity  against  most  microorganisms 
causing  cSSTI  and  CAP.  Furthermore,  ceftaroline  fosamil  belongs  to  well-known  class  of  antibiotics 
(cephalosporins)  that  have  been  in  clinical  use  for  several  decades  and  have  demonstrated  good  safety 
profile. Cephalosporins are commonly used in neonatal units world-wide.  
CHMP noted that the applicant is not seeking approval for LOS, the disease that is more common than cSSTI 
and CAP with poor outcome and limited treatment options in neonates and young children. As ceftaroline 
fosamil is theoretically a good candidate to improve treatment options for LOS there is a risk of off-label use.  
Although cephalosporins are well tolerated there are some AEs related to their use as well. All beta-lactams 
have  risk  of  seizures  and  can  cause  CID  colitis.  The  latter  is  still  very  rare  and  difficult  to  diagnose  in 
neonates and young infants. Coombs seropositivity is a well-known side effect of cephalosporins including 
ceftaroline fosamil that is sometimes accompanied by haemolytic anaemia that has not been observed with 
ceftaroline fosamil in adults or older children. 
As with all antibiotics ceftaroline fosamil has potential to out-select resistant microorganisms especially in 
cases of inappropriate consumption. 
3.6.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zinforo is positive. 
In addition the applicant should submit the following safety data in the next PSUR: a detailed review of all 
neonatal cases treated with ceftaroline fosamil.

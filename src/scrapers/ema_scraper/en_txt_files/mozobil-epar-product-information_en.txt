CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications  
Adult patients 
Mozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance 
mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent 
autologous transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise 
poorly (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years)  
Mozobil is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells 
to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with 
lymphoma or solid malignant tumours, either: 
- 
pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after 
adequate mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be 
insufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or 
-  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells (see section 4.2). 
4.2 
Posology and method of administration  
Mozobil therapy should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in oncology and/or 
haematology. The mobilisation and apheresis procedures should be performed in collaboration with an 
oncology-haematology centre with acceptable experience in this field and where the monitoring of 
haematopoietic progenitor cells can be correctly performed. 
Age over 60 and/ or prior myelosuppressive chemotherapy and/or extensive prior chemotherapy 
and/or a peak circulating stem cell count of less than 20 stem cells/microliter, have been identified as 
predictors of poor mobilisation.

Posology  
Adult 
The recommended daily dose of plerixafor by subcutaneous injection (SC) is:  
•  20 mg fixed dose or 0.24 mg/kg of body weight for patients weighing ≤ 83 kg (see section 
5.2).  
•  0.24 mg/kg of body weight for patients weighing > 83 kg. 
Paediatric (1 to less than 18 years) 
The recommended daily dose of plerixafor by subcutaneous injection (SC) is: 
•  0.24 mg/kg of body weight (see section 5.1). 
Each vial of plerixafor is filled to deliver 1.2 ml of 20 mg/ml plerixafor aqueous solution for injection 
containing 24 mg of plerixafor. 
Plerixafor has to be drawn up into a syringe size type which should be selected according to the weight 
of the patient. 
For low weight patients, up to 45 kg of body weight, 1 ml syringes for use in infant patients can be 
used. This type of syringe has major graduations for 0.1 ml and minor graduations for 0.01 ml and 
therefore is suitable to administer plerixafor, at a dose of 240 µg/kg, to paediatric patients of at least 
9 kg body weight. 
For patients of more than 45 kg, a1 ml or 2 ml syringe with graduations that allow a volume to 0.1 ml 
to be measured can be used. 
It should be administered by subcutaneous injection 6 to 11 hours prior to initiation of each apheresis 
following 4 day pre-treatment with G-CSF. In clinical trials, Mozobil has been commonly used for 2 
to 4 (and up to 7) consecutive days. 
The weight used to calculate the dose of plerixafor should be obtained within 1 week before the first 
dose of plerixafor. In clinical studies, the dose of plerixafor has been calculated based on body weight 
in patients up to 175% of ideal body weight. Plerixafor dose and treatment of patients weighing more 
than 175% of ideal body weight have not been investigated. Ideal body weight can be determined 
using the following equations:  
male (kg): 
female (kg): 
50 + 2.3  x  ((Height (cm)  x  0.394) – 60); 
45.5 + 2.3  x  ((Height (cm)  x  0.394) – 60).  
Based on increasing exposure with increasing body weight, the plerixafor dose should not exceed 
40 mg/day. 
Recommended concomitant medicinal products 
In pivotal clinical studies supporting the use of Mozobil, all patients received daily morning doses of 
10 µg/kg G-CSF for 4 consecutive days prior to the first dose of plerixafor and on each morning prior 
to apheresis.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Patients with creatinine clearance 20-50 ml/min should have their dose of plerixafor reduced by 
one-third to 0.16 mg/kg/day (see section 5.2). Clinical data with this dose adjustment are limited. 
There is insufficient clinical experience to make alternative posology recommendations for patients 
with a creatinine clearance <20 ml/min, as well as to make posology recommendations for patients on 
haemodialysis. 
Based on increasing exposure with increasing body weight the dose should not exceed 27 mg/day if 
the creatinine clearance is lower than 50 ml/min. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Mozobil in children (1 to less than 18 years) were studied in an open label, 
multicenter, controlled study (see sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2). 
Elderly patients (> 65 years old) 
No dose modifications are necessary in elderly patients with normal renal function. Dose adjustment 
in elderly patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min is recommended (see Renal impairment 
above). In general, care should be taken in dose selection for elderly patients due to the greater 
frequency of decreased renal function with advanced age.   
Method of administration 
Mozobil is for subcutaneous injection. Each vial is intended for single use only. 
Vials should be inspected visually prior to administration and not used if there is particulate matter or 
discolouration. Since Mozobil is supplied as a sterile, preservative-free formulation, aseptic technique 
should be followed when transferring the contents of the vial to a suitable syringe for subcutaneous 
administration (see section 6.3). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Tumour cell mobilisation in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
When Mozobil is used in conjunction with G-CSF for haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation in 
patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma‚ tumour cells may be released from the marrow and 
subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. Results showed that, in case tumour cells are 
mobilised, the number of tumour cells mobilised is not increased upon Mozobil plus G-CSF compared 
to G-CSF alone.  
Tumour cell mobilisation in leukaemia patients 
In a compassionate use programme, Mozobil and G-CSF have been administered to patients with 
acute myelogenous leukaemia and plasma cell leukaemia. In some instances, these patients 
experienced an increase in the number of circulating leukaemia cells. For the purpose of 
haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation, plerixafor may cause mobilisation of leukaemic cells and 
subsequent contamination of the apheresis product. Therefore, plerixafor is not recommended for 
haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation and harvest in patients with leukaemia. 
Haematological effects 
Hyperleukocytosis 
Administration of Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF increases circulating leukocytes as well as 
haematopoietic stem cell populations. White blood cell counts should be monitored during Mozobil 
therapy. Clinical judgment should be exercised when administering Mozobil to patients with 
peripheral blood neutrophil counts above 50 x 109/L.  
Thrombocytopenia 
Thrombocytopenia is a known complication of apheresis and has been observed in patients receiving 
Mozobil.  Platelet counts should be monitored in all patients receiving Mozobil and undergoing 
apheresis. 
Allergic reactions 
Mozobil has been uncommonly associated with potential systemic reactions related to subcutaneous 
injection such as urticaria, periorbital swelling, dyspnoea, or hypoxia (see section 4.8). Symptoms 
responded to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or 
resolved spontaneously. Cases of anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock, have been 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reported from world-wide post-marketing experience. Appropriate precautions should be taken 
because of the potential for these reactions. 
Vasovagal reactions 
Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur following subcutaneous 
injections (see section 4.8). Appropriate precautions should be taken because of the potential for these 
reactions. 
Effect on the spleen 
In preclinical studies, higher absolute and relative spleen weights associated with extramedullary 
haematopoiesis were observed following prolonged (2 to 4 weeks) daily plerixafor subcutaneous 
administration in rats at doses approximately 4 fold higher than the recommended human dose. 
The effect of plerixafor on spleen size in patients has not been specifically evaluated in clinical 
studies. Cases of splenic enlargement and/or rupture have been reported following the administration 
of Mozobil in conjunction with growth factor G-CSF. Individuals receiving Mozobil in conjunction 
with G-CSF who report left upper abdominal pain and/or scapular or shoulder pain should be 
evaluated for splenic integrity.  
Sodium 
Mozobil contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium- free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. In vitro tests showed that plerixafor was not metabolised 
by P450 CYP enzymes, did not inhibit or induce P450 CYP enzymes. Plerixafor did not act as a 
substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an in vitro study.  
In clinical studies of patients with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, the addition of rituximab to a 
mobilisation regimen of plerixafor and G-CSF did not impact patient safety or CD34+ cell yield. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of plerixafor in pregnant women. 
Based on the pharmacodynamic mechanism of action, plerixafor is suggested to cause congenital 
malformations when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown teratogenicity 
(see section 5.3). Mozobil should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the 
woman requires treatment with plerixafor.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether plerixafor is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with Mozobil. 
Fertility 
The effects of plerixafor on male and female fertility are not known (see section 5.3). 
4.7 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Mozobil may influence the ability to drive and use machines. Some patients have experienced 
dizziness, fatigue or vasovagal reactions; therefore caution is advised when driving or operating 
machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile 
Safety data for Mozobil in conjunction with G-CSF in oncology patients with lymphoma and multiple 
myeloma were obtained from 2 placebo-controlled Phase III studies (301 patients) and 10 uncontrolled 
Phase II studies (242 patients). Patients were primarily treated with daily doses of 0.24 mg/kg 
plerixafor by subcutaneous injection. The exposure to plerixafor in these studies ranged from 1 to 
7 consecutive days (median = 2 days). 
In the two Phase III studies in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients 
(AMD3100-3101 and AMD3100-3102, respectively), a total of 301 patients were treated in the 
Mozobil and G-CSF group and 292 patients were treated in the placebo and G-CSF group. Patients 
received daily morning doses of G-CSF 10 µg/kg for 4 days prior to the first dose of plerixafor or 
placebo and on each morning prior to apheresis. Adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with 
Mozobil and G-CSF than placebo and G-CSF and were reported as related in ≥1% of the patients who 
received Mozobil, during haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation and apheresis and prior to 
chemotherapy/ablative treatment in preparation for transplantation are shown in Table 1.  
From chemotherapy/ablative treatment in preparation of transplantation through 12 months 
post-transplantation, no significant differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed 
across treatment groups.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are listed by System Organ Class and frequency. Frequencies are defined according 
to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data).

* The frequency of allergic reactions presented is based on adverse reactions that occurred in the oncology studies 
(679 patients). Events included one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), periorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnoea 
(n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). These events were generally mild or moderate and occurred within approximately 30 min 
after Mozobil administration. 
** From post-marketing experience 
The adverse reactions reported in patients with lymphoma and multiple myeloma who received 
Mozobil in the controlled Phase III studies and uncontrolled studies, including a Phase II study of 
Mozobil as monotherapy for haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation, are similar. No significant 
differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed for oncology patients by disease, age, 
or gender. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myocardial infarction 
In clinical studies, 7 of 679 oncology patients experienced myocardial infarctions after haematopoietic 
stem cell mobilisation with plerixafor and G-CSF. All events occurred at least 14 days after last 
Mozobil administration. Additionally, two female oncology patients in the compassionate use 
programme experienced myocardial infarction following haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation with 
plerixafor and G-CSF. One of these events occurred 4 days after last Mozobil administration. Lack of 
temporal relationship in 8 of 9 patients coupled with the risk profile of patients with myocardial 
infarction does not suggest Mozobil confers an independent risk for myocardial infarction in patients 
who also receive G-CSF. 
Hyperleukocytosis 
White blood cell counts of 100 x 109/L or greater were observed, on the day prior to or any day of 
apheresis, in 7% patients receiving Mozobil and in 1% patients receiving placebo in the Phase III 
studies. No complications or clinical symptoms of leukostasis were observed. 
Vasovagal reactions 
In Mozobil oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, less than 1% of subjects experienced 
vasovagal reactions (orthostatic hypotension and/or syncope) following subcutaneous administration 
of plerixafor doses ≤0.24 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of Mozobil 
administration. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
In Mozobil clinical studies of oncology patients, there have been rare reports of severe gastrointestinal 
events, including diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 
Paraesthesia 
Paraesthesia is commonly observed in oncology patients undergoing autologous transplantation 
following multiple disease interventions. In the placebo-controlled Phase III studies, the incidence of 
paraesthesia was 20.6% and 21.2% in the plerixafor and placebo groups, respectively. 
Elderly patients 
In the two placebo-controlled clinical studies of plerixafor, 24% of patients were ≥ 65 years old. No 
notable differences in the incidence of adverse reactions were observed in these elderly patients when 
compared with younger ones. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population  
Thirty patients were treated with 0.24 mg/kg of Mozobil in an open label, multicenter, controlled study 
(DFI 12860) (see section 5.1). 
The safety profile in this paediatric study was consistent with what has been observed in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9 
Overdose 
No case of overdose has been reported. Based on limited data at doses above the recommended dose 
and up to 0.48 mg/kg the frequency of gastrointestinal disorders, vasovagal reactions, orthostatic 
hypotension, and/or syncope may be higher.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other immunostimulants; ATC code: L03AX16 
Mechanism of action 
Plerixafor is a bicyclam derivative, a selective reversible antagonist of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor 
and blocks binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), also known as 
CXCL12. Plerixafor-induced leukocytosis and elevations in circulating haematopoietic progenitor cell 
levels are thought to result from a disruption of CXCR4 binding to its cognate ligand, resulting in the 
appearance of both mature and pluripotent cells in the systemic circulation. CD34+ cells mobilised by 
plerixafor are functional and capable of engraftment with long-term repopulating capacity. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In pharmacodynamic studies in healthy volunteers of plerixafor alone, peak mobilisation of CD34+ 
cells was observed from 6 to 9 hours after administration. In pharmacodynamic studies in healthy 
volunteers of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF administered at identical dose regimen to that in 
studies in patients, a sustained elevation in the peripheral blood CD34+ count was observed from 4 to 
18 hours after plerixafor administration with peak response between 10 and 14 hours. 
In order to compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of plerixafor following 0.24 mg/kg 
based and fixed (20 mg) doses, a trial was conducted in adult patients with NHL (N=61) who were 
treated with 0.24 mg/kg or 20 mg of plerixafor. The trial was conducted in patients weighing 70 kg or 
less (median: 63.7 kg , min: 34.2 kg, max: 70 kg). The fixed 20 mg dose showed 1.43-fold higher 
exposure (AUC0-10h) than the 0.24 mg/kg dose (Table 2). The fixed 20 mg dose also showed 
numerically higher response rate (5.2% [60.0% vs 54.8%] based on the local lab data and 11.7% 
[63.3% vs 51.6%] based on the central lab data) in attaining the target of ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
than the mg/kg-based dose. The median time to reach ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg was 3 days for both 
treatment groups, and the safety profile between the groups was similar. Body weight of 83 kg was 
selected as the cut-off point to transition patients from fixed to weight based dosing (83 kg x 0.24 mg 
= 19.92 mg/kg).

Clinical efficacy and safety 
In two Phase III randomised-controlled studies patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma or multiple 
myeloma received Mozobil 0.24 mg/kg or placebo on each evening prior to apheresis. Patients 
received daily morning doses of G-CSF 10 μg/kg for 4 days prior to the first dose of plerixafor or 
placebo and on each morning prior to apheresis. Optimal (5 or 6 x 106 cells/kg) and minimal 
(2 x 106 cells/kg) numbers of CD34+ cells/kg within a given number of days, as well as the primary 
composite endpoints which incorporated successful engraftment are presented in Tables 3 and 5; the 
proportion of patients reaching optimal numbers of CD34+ cells/kg by apheresis day are presented in 
Tables 4 and 6.

Rescue patients 
In study AMD3100-3101, 62 patients (10 in the Mozobil + G-CSF group and 52 in the placebo + G-
CSF group), who could not mobilise sufficient numbers of CD34+ cells and thus could not proceed to 
transplantation, entered into an open-label Rescue procedure with Mozobil and G-CSF. Of these 
patients, 55 % (34 out of 62) mobilised ≥ 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had successful engraftment. In 
study AMD3100-3102, 7 patients (all from the placebo + G-CSF group) entered the Rescue procedure. 
Of these patients, 100% (7 out of 7) mobilised ≥ 2 x106/kg CD34+ cells and had successful 
engraftment. 
The dose of haematopoietic stem cells used for each transplant was determined by the investigator and 
all haematopoietic stem cells that were collected were not necessarily transplanted. For transplanted 
patients in the Phase III studies, median time to neutrophil engraftment (10-11 days), median time to 
platelet engraftment (18-20 days) and graft durability up to 12 months post-transplantation were 
similar across the Mozobil and placebo groups. 
Mobilisation and engraftment data from supportive Phase II studies (plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg dosed on 
the evening or morning prior to apheresis) in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s 
disease, or multiple myeloma were similar to those data for the Phase III studies. 
In the placebo-controlled studies, fold increase in peripheral blood CD34+ cell count (cells/µl) over 
the 24-hour period from the day prior to the first apheresis to just before the first apheresis was 
evaluated (Table 7). During that 24-hour period, the first dose of plerixafor 0.24 mg/kg or placebo was 
administered 10-11 hours prior to apheresis.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Mozobil in children aged 0 to 1 year in myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy to treat malignant 
disorders, which requires an autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy and safety of Mozobil were evaluated in an open label, multi-center, controlled study in 
paediatric patients with solid tumors (including neuroblastoma, sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) or 
lymphoma who were eligible for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (DFI12860). 
Patients with leukemia, persistent high percentage marrow involvement prior to mobilization, or 
previous stem cell transplantation were excluded. 
Forty-five paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) were randomised, 2:1, using 0.24 mg/kg of 
Mozobil plus standard mobilisation (G-CSF plus or minus chemotherapy) versus control (standard 
mobilisation alone). Median age was 5.3 years (min: max 1:18) in the Mozobil arm versus 4.7 years 
(min:max 1:17) in the control arm. 
Only one patient aged less than 2 years old was randomized to the plerixafor treatment arm. There was 
an imbalance between treatment arms in peripheral blood CD34+ counts on the day prior to first 
apheresis (i.e. prior to administration of plerixafor), with less circulating PB CD34+ in the plerixafor 
arm. The median PB CD34+ cell counts at baseline were 15 cells/µl in the Mozobil arm versus 
35 cells/µl in control arm. The primary analysis showed that 80% of patients in the Mozobil arm 
experienced at least a doubling of the PB CD34+ count, observed from the morning of the day 
preceding the first planned apheresis to the morning prior to apheresis, versus, 28.6 % of patients in 
the control arm (p=0.0019). The median increase in PB CD34+ cell counts from baseline to the day of 
apheresis was by 3.2 fold in the Mozobil arm versus by 1.4 fold in the control arm. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties  
The pharmacokinetics of plerixafor have been evaluated in lymphoma and multiple myeloma patients 
at the clinical dose level of 0.24 mg/kg following pre-treatment with G-CSF (10 µg/kg once daily for 
4 consecutive days). 
Absorption 
Plerixafor is rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, reaching peak concentrations in 
approximately 30-60 minutes (tmax). Following subcutaneous administration of a 0.24 mg/kg dose to 
patients after receiving 4-days of G-CSF pre-treatment, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and 
systemic exposure (AUC0-24) of plerixafor were 887 ± 217 ng/ml and 4337 ± 922 ng·hr/ml, 
respectively. 
Distribution 
Plerixafor is moderately bound to human plasma proteins up to 58%. The apparent volume of 
distribution of plerixafor in humans is 0.3 l/kg demonstrating that plerixafor is largely confined to, but 
not limited to, the extravascular fluid space.  
Biotransformation 
Plerixafor is not metabolised in vitro using human liver microsomes or human primary hepatocytes 
and does not exhibit inhibitory activity in vitro towards the major drug-metabolising CYP450 enzymes 
(1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4/5). In in vitro studies with human hepatocytes, 
plerixafor does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4 enzymes. These findings suggest that 
plerixafor has a low potential for involvement in P450-dependent drug-drug interactions. 
Elimination 
The major route of elimination of plerixafor is urinary. Following a 0.24 mg/kg dose in healthy 
volunteers with normal renal function, approximately 70% of the dose was excreted unchanged in 
urine during the first 24 hours following administration. The elimination half-life (t1/2) in plasma is 
3-5 hours. Plerixafor did not act as a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein in an in vitro study with 
MDCKII and MDCKII-MDR1 cell models. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
Following a single dose of 0.24 mg/kg plerixafor, clearance was reduced in subjects with varying 
degrees of renal impairment and was positively correlated with creatinine clearance (CrCl). Mean 
values of AUC0-24 of plerixafor in subjects with mild (CrCl 51-80 ml/min), moderate 
(CrCl 31-50 ml/min) and severe (CrCl ≤ 30 ml/min) renal impairment were 5410, 6780, and 
6990 ng.hr/ml, respectively, which were higher than the exposure observed in healthy subjects with 
normal renal function (5070 ng·hr/ml). Renal impairment had no effect on Cmax.. 
Gender  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect of gender on pharmacokinetics of plerixafor. 
Elderly  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no effect of age on pharmacokinetics of plerixafor.  
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of plerixafor were evaluated in 48 paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) 
with solid tumours at subcutaneous doses of 0.16, 0.24 and 0.32 mg/kg with standard mobilisation (G-
CSF plus or minus chemotherapy). Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and similar to 
adults, µg/kg-based dosage results in increase in plerixafor exposure with increasing body weight in 
paediatric patients. At the same weight-based dosing regimen of 240 µg/kg, the plerixafor mean 
exposure (AUC0-24h) is lower in paediatric patients aged 2 to <6 years (1410 ng.h/mL), 6 to <12 years 
(2318 ng.h/mL), and 12 to <18 years (2981 ng.h/mL) than in adults (4337 ng.h/mL). Based on 
population pharmacokinetic modeling, the plerixafor mean exposures (AUC0-24h) in paediatric patients 
aged 2 to <6 years (1905 ng.h/mL), 6 to <12 years (3063 ng.h/mL), and 12 to <18 years 
(4015  ng.h/mL), at the dose of 320 µg/kg are closer to the exposure in adults receiving 240 µg/kg.  
However, mobilization of PB CD34+ count was observed in stage 2 of the trial. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data  
The results from single dose subcutaneous studies in rats and mice showed plerixafor can induce 
transient but severe neuromuscular effects (uncoordinated movement), sedative-like effects 
(hypoactivity), dyspnoea, ventral or lateral recumbency, and/or muscle spasms. Additional effects of 
plerixafor consistently noted in repeated dose animal studies included increased levels of circulating 
white blood cells and increased urinary excretion of calcium and magnesium in rats and dogs, slightly 
higher spleen weights in rats, and diarrhoea and tachycardia in dogs. Histopathology findings of 
extramedullary haematopoiesis were observed in the liver and spleen of rats and/or dogs. One or more 
of these findings were usually observed at systemic exposures in the same order of magnitude or 
slightly higher than the human clinical exposure.  
The results of the dose range-finding study in juvenile miniature pigs and the range-finding and 
definitive studies in juvenile rats were similar to those observed in adult mice, rats, and dogs. 
Exposure margins in the juvenile rat study at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were ≥18 fold when 
compared with the highest clinical paediatric dose in children up to 18 years of age. 
An in vitro general receptor activity screen showed that plerixafor, at a concentration (5 µg/ml) several 
fold higher than the maximum human systemic level, has moderate or strong binding affinity for a 
number of different receptors predominantly located on pre-synaptic nerve endings in the central 
nervous system (CNS) and/or the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (N-type calcium channel, 
potassium channel SKCA, histamine H3, acetylcholine muscarinic M1 and M2, adrenergic α1B and α2C, 
neuropeptide Y/Y1 and glutamate NMDA polyamine receptors). The clinical relevance of these 
findings is not known. 
Safety pharmacology studies with intravenously administered plerixafor in rats showed respiratory and 
cardiac depressant effects at systemic exposure slightly above the human clinical exposure, whilst 
subcutaneous administration elicited respiratory and cardiovascular effects only at higher systemic 
levels. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
SDF-1α and CXCR4 play major roles in embryo-foetal development. Plerixafor has been shown to 
cause increased resorptions, decreased foetal weights, retarded skeletal development and increased 
foetal abnormalities in rats and rabbits. Data from animal models also suggest modulation of foetal 
haematopoiesis, vascularisation, and cerebellar development by SDF-1α and CXCR4. Systemic 
exposure at No Observed Adverse Effect Level for teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits was of the 
same magnitude or lower as found at therapeutic doses in patients. This teratogenic potential is likely 
due to its pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. 
In rat distribution studies concentrations of radiolabelled plerixafor was detected in reproductive 
organs (testes, ovaria, uterus) two weeks after single or 7 daily repeated doses in males and after 
7 daily repeated doses in females. The elimination rate from tissues was slow. 
The potential effects of plerixafor on male fertility and postnatal development have not been evaluated 
in non-clinical studies. 
Carcinogenicity studies with plerixafor have not been conducted. Plerixafor was not genotoxic in an 
adequate battery of genotoxicity tests. 
Plerixafor inhibited tumour growth in in vivo models of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, glioblastoma, 
medulloblastoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia when dosed intermittently. An increase of non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma growth was noted after a continuous administration of plerixafor for 28 days. 
The potential risk associated with this effect is expected to be low for the intended short term duration 
of dosing plerixafor in humans.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mozobil is and what it is used for 
Mozobil contains the active substance plerixafor which blocks a protein on the surface of blood stem 
cells. This protein “ties” blood stem cells to the bone marrow. Plerixafor improves the release of stem 
cells into the blood stream (mobilisation). The stem cells can then be collected by a machine that 
separates blood constituents (apheresis machine), and subsequently frozen and stored until your 
transplant. 
If mobilisation is poor, Mozobil is used to help collect blood stem cells from the patient, for collection, 
storage and reintroduction (transplantation), 
• 
In adults who have lymphoma (a cancer of the white blood cells) or multiple myeloma (a cancer 
that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow). 
In children age 1 to less than 18 years of age with lymphoma or solid tumours.  
• 
2.  What you need to know before you use Mozobil 
Do not use Mozobil  
• 
if you are allergic to plerixafor or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before using Mozobil.  
Tell your doctor:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you have or have had any heart problems. 
if you have kidney problems. Your doctor may adjust the dose. 
if you have high white blood cell counts.  
if you have low platelet counts. 
if you have a history of feeling faint or lightheaded on standing or sitting or have fainted before 
upon injections. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Your doctor may perform regular blood tests to monitor your blood cell count. 
It is not recommended to use Mozobil for stem cell mobilisation if you have leukaemia (a cancer of 
the blood or bone marrow). 
Other medicines and Mozobil 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
You should not use Mozobil if you are pregnant, since there is no experience with Mozobil in pregnant 
women. It is important to tell your doctor if you are, think you may be or are planning to become 
pregnant. It is recommended to use contraception if you are of child-bearing age.  
You should not breast-feed if you are using Mozobil, since it is not known if Mozobil is excreted in 
human milk.  
Driving and using machines 
Mozobil may cause dizziness and fatigue. Therefore, you should avoid driving if you feel dizzy, tired 
or unwell. 
Mozobil contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Mozobil 
Your medicine will be injected by a doctor or a nurse.  
You will first receive G-CSF, then you will be given Mozobil 
Mobilisation will be started by first giving you another medicine called G-CSF (granulocyte-colony 
stimulating factor). G-CSF will help Mozobil to work properly in your body. If you want to know 
more about G-CSF ask your doctor and read the corresponding package leaflet. 
How much Mozobil is given? 
The recommended adult dose is either a 20 mg (fixed dose) or 0.24 mg/kg body weight/day.  
The recommended dose for children, 1 to less than 18 years of age is 0.24 mg/kg of body weight/day.  
Your dose will depend on your body weight, which should be measured the week before you receive 
your first dose. If you have moderate or severe kidney problems, your doctor will reduce the dose.  
How is Mozobil given? 
Mozobil is given by subcutaneous injection (under your skin). 
When is Mozobil given for the first time? 
You will receive your first dose 6 to 11 hours before apheresis (collection of your blood stem cells). 
How long will Mozobil be given? 
Treatment lasts 2 to 4 consecutive days (in some cases up to 7 days), until enough stem cells have 
been collected for your transplant. In a few cases, enough stem cells may not be collected, and the 
collection attempt will be stopped. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Please tell your doctor immediately if  
• 
shortly after receiving Mozobil, you experience rash, swelling around the eyes, shortness of 
breath or lack of oxygen, feeling lightheaded on standing or sitting, feeling faint or fainting 
you have pain in the upper left abdomen (belly) or your left shoulder 
• 
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
• 
• 
diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), injection site redness or irritation 
low red blood cell count by laboratory test (anaemia in children) 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
headache  
dizziness, feeling tired or unwell  
difficulty in sleeping 
flatulence, constipation, indigestion, vomiting  
stomach symptoms such as pain, swelling or discomfort  
dry mouth, numbness around the mouth  
sweating, generalised redness of the skin, joint pains, pains in muscles and bones 
Uncommon side effects (may affect up to 1 in 100 people) 
•

allergic reactions such as skin rash, swelling around the eyes, shortness of breath 
anaphylactic reactions, including anaphylactic shock 
abnormal dreams, nightmares 
Rarely, gastrointestinal side effects may be severe (diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain and nausea). 
Heart attacks 
In clinical trials, patients with risk factors for a heart attack uncommonly suffered heart attacks after 
being given Mozobil and G-CSF. Please inform your doctor immediately if you experience chest 
discomfort. 
Pins and needles and numbness 
Pins and needles and numbness are common in patients being treated for cancers. About one in five 
patients suffered from these feelings. However, these effects do not seem to occur more frequently 
when you use Mozobil. 
You may also have an increase in white blood cells count (leucocytosis), in your blood tests. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or nurse. This includes any possible side effects not 
listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in 
Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of this

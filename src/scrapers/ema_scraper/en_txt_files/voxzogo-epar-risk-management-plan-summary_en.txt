PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN BY PRODUCT 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Voxzogo (vosoritide) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Voxzogo. The RMP details important risks of 
Voxzogo, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Voxzogo’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Voxzogo’s SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Voxzogo should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Voxzogo should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Voxzogo’s RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Voxzogo is indicated for the treatment of achondroplasia in patients 2 years of age and 
older whose epiphyses are not closed (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains 
vosoritide as the active substance and it is given by daily subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Voxzogo’s benefits can be found in 
Voxzogo’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/voxzogo  
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Voxzogo, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Voxzogo 's risks, are outlined below. 
•  Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate 
 
 
 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Voxzogo is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A.  List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Voxzogo are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Voxzogo. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the longterm 
use of the medicine);

2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1. 
Introduction 
Ellaone is a tablet containing 30 mg of micronized ulipristal acetate. 
The proposed indication is: Emergency contraception within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sexual 
intercourse or contraceptive failure. 
The proposed posology is one tablet to be taken orally as soon as possible, but no later than 120 hours 
(5 days) after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. 
Despite the availability of highly effective methods of contraception, many pregnancies are unplanned. 
Emergency contraception (EC), defined as treatments aimed at preventing pregnancy after unprotected 
sexual intercourse, is an important means of preventing unwanted pregnancy following unprotected 
intercourse (UPI). It is intended as a backup for occasional, emergency use only. 
The history of emergency contraception dates back to the 1960s when hormonal regimens were first 
introduced.  
•  Following  the  introduction  of  high-dose  oestrogens,  the  so-called  Yuzpe  regimen,  involving  the 
combined  use  of  oestrogen  (100  microgram  ethinylestradiol)  and  progestogen  (0.5  mg 
levonorgestrel or 1 mg dl-norgestrel) repeated once 12 hours apart with the first dose given within 
72 hours of UPI, became popular in the late 70s and early 80s of last century1. The Yuzpe regimen 
was associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting due to the high oestrogen content.  
•  Since 1990s the potential of levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestagen, was recognised and was set to 
replace the previous Yuzpe regimen of combined high-dose oral contraceptives. Levonelle-2 and 
Norlevo were approved in a two dose regimen by a mutual recognition procedure (UK/H/363/01 
and FR/H/146/01 respectively), i.e. two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel, the first tablet to be taken 
within  72  hours  of  UPI  and  the  second  tablet  12  hours  later.  After  studies  showing  the  same 
efficacy  of  two  doses  of  0.75  mg  levonorgestrel  12  hours  apart  compared  with  1.5  mg 
levonorgestrel  given  at  once,  1.5  mg  tablets  of  levonorgestrel  were  also  granted  marketing 
authorisation  by  a  mutual  recognition  procedure  (Norlevo  FR/H/146/02  and  Levonelle  1500  µg 
UK/H/803/01). 
•  Recent interest in the development of alternative regimens has led to trials of the antigonadotropin 
danazol,  and  antiprogestogens  including  mifepristone2,  but  not  to  marketing  authorisation  in  the 
EU. 
•  Another option to prevent pregnancy after UPI is the postcoital insertion of a copper intra-uterine 
device  (although  not  approved  or  labelled  for  such  use)  that  can  be  used  up  to  5  days  after  the 
estimated time of ovulation, keeping it in the uterus as a long-term regular contraceptive method. 
The chemical structures of progesterone, mifepristone and ulipristal (CDB-2914) are shown in the 
figure below.

The  National  Institute  of  Child  Health  and  Human  Development  (NICHD)  initiated  the  clinical 
development  phase  of  ulipristal  acetate for  use  as  an  emergency  contraception. The applicant,  HRA 
Pharma, licensed the rights to the compound in 2000. 
The application is therefore constituted of a mix of own studies from the applicant and studies 
submitted in the form of publications. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
HRA  Pharma  has  submitted  an  application  for  Ellaone  30mg  tablet  containing  the  new  active 
substance ulipristal acetate.  Other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, povidone K30, purified water, 
croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.  
The tablets are packed in PVC/PE/PVDC blister sealed with aluminium foil.  
Active Substance 
Ulipristal  acetate,  or  17α-acetoxy-11α-(4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl)-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-
dione,  is  a  white  to  yellow  crystalline  powder.  It  is  freely  soluble  in  methylene  chloride,  soluble  in 
methanol, acetone and ethanol and insoluble in water.  
The structure of the active substance ulipristal acetate is shown below.  
Ulipristal acetate has 5 asymetric carbons but only the following absolute configuration of the chiral 
centers according is used : 8S, 11S, 13S, 14R, 17R. 
Two polymorphs have been found 
•  Manufacture 
Information  about  manufacturing  process  has been  provided  using  Active  Substance  Master 
File (ASMF) procedure.  
5/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The four step synthesis has been well described.  
Critical parameters and accompanying in-process controls have been defined. Adequate specification 
has  been  provided  for  all  starting  materials  (reagents,  solvents  and  auxiliary  materials)  and 
intermediates  have  been  satisfactorily  controlled.    Impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been 
investigated and fully justified by toxicological studies. 
Batch  analysis  data  produced  with  the  proposed  synthetic  route  provided  show  that  the  active 
substance can be manufactured reproducibly.  
•  Specification 
The drug substance specification includes tests for description, identification (Infra-Red spectrum and 
HPLC),  appearance  of  solution,  melting  point,  loss  on  drying  (Karl-Fischer),  related  substances 
(HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  particle  size  distribution  (laser-light  scattering), 
optical rotation, heavy metals and polymorphic purity (Differential Scanning Calorimetry).   
A satisfactory description for all analytical methods was provided. The methods are Ph Eur apart from 
related  substances,  assay,  residual  solvents,  and  particle  size  distribution,  optical  rotation  and 
polymorphic  purity.  Full  method  validation  data  was  provided  for  the  non  compendial  (in-house) 
analytical methods 
The particle size specification for the micronized drug substance drug substance is important to ensure 
a satisfactory dissolution and bioavailability behaviour. 
Specification  is  appropriate  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  requirements.  In  particular,  the  impurity 
limits have been justified. The residual solvents limits are those of the ICH Q3C guideline or tighter.  
Data  on  7  non-consecutive  batches  of  active  substance  used  for  clinical  studies  and  for  primary 
stability studies have been presented. All the results were found within the specification in particular 
for the impurities and the residual solvents.  
The  drug  substance  is  packaged  in  double  polyethylene  film  bags  placed  into  high-density 
polyethylene drums. The drums used are opaque high density polyethylene containers; therefore, the 
product  is  stored  in  light-resistant  containers.  The  container  closure  system  has  been  adequately 
described and appropriate specification is present including IR identification,  
•  Stability 
Stability studies for three validation-production batches were carried out according to ICH guidelines 
for  real time  (25°C/60% RH)  and  accelerated  conditions  (40°C/75% RH). The  following  parameters 
were  studied:  description,  identification  by  IR,  assay,  loss  on  drying,  related  substances  and  optical 
rotation. The limits are the same as those proposed for release.  
6  month  data  at  40°C/75% RH  proves  the  stability  of  ulipristal  acetate  when  stored  under  ICH 
accelerated  conditions.  The  long-term  stability  study  is  due  to  last  five  years;  all  acceptance 
requirements are met for the 24 month results available as of today.  
In summary, the stability data provided support the proposed re-test period.  
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
Ulipristal acetate was evaluated with different formulations through phase I, II and III clinical trials. 
Based on comparative clinical bioavailability results and phase II studies, a 30mg immediate release 
tablet was developed. Taking into account the properties of the active substance and the requirements 
in  terms  of  particle  size  distribution,  the  active  substance  is  micronized  and  a  wet  granulation  was 
developed.  
6/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  choice  and the  functions  of  the excipients that  are  in  the final  formulation have  been  described 
and  justified.  These  are:  lactose  monohydrate  (diluent),  povidone  K30  (binder),  purified  water 
(processing aid during wet granulation), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrating agent), and magnesium 
stearate (lubricant). All of them are controlled according to the current version of the Ph. Eur.  
None of the materials used in the synthesis of ulipristal acetate active substance and excipients used in 
the tablets are of animal or human origin and therefore there is no risk of TSE contamination.  
Ellaone tablets area packed in an immediate packaging obtained by sealing together:  
- a transparent colourless 250 µm PVC/PE/PVDC Triplex foil ,  
- a 20 µm aluminum foil. This foil is coated with heat sealing varnish on the inner face. 
Packaging components comply with the current EU legislation.  
No  interaction  between the  tablets  and the  chosen  immediate  packaging  material  has  been  observed 
during stability studies.  
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The tablets are manufactured according to a standard wet granulation process which involves 
(1) mixing of powders, (2) wetting, (3) granulation, (4) drying, (5) calibration, (6) mixing, (7) 
lubrication,  (8)  compression  and  (9)  packaging.    The  manufacturing  process  is  satisfactorily 
described and the in-process controls are  adequate. A flow diagram and detailed description 
of the equipment have been provided.  
At the time of submission validation protocol only was provided and supported by an evaluation of the 
manufacturing  process  performed  on  two  pilot  scale  batches  and  one  industrial  batch.  This  is 
acceptable  as  according  to  CPMP/QWP/848/96,  Note  for  Guidance  on  Process  Validation,  “it  is 
recognised  that,  at  the  time  of  submission,  process  validation  data  may  not  always  be  available. 
Nevertheless  it  is  essential  that  valid  manufacturing  processes  are  always  utilised”.  The  in-process 
control  parameters  were  verified  during  the  manufacture  of  pilot  batches.  Also  the  applicant 
committed to perform validation on the first three production scale batches. 
•  Product Specification 
The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, 
identification  (TLC  and  HPLC),  mean  mass,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  impurities  and 
degradation  products  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  disintegration  (Ph.  Eur.),  microbial 
contamination (Ph. Eur.), and assay (HPLC). 
Full  details  of  all  analytical  methods  are  provided.  All  non  pharmacopoeial  methods  have  been 
satisfactory  validated.  Impurities  have  been  appropriately  controlled  and  their  limits  justified  by 
toxicological  studies.  The  proposed  limits  for  individual  degradation  products  is  in  line  with  the 
qualification and identification threshold in the ICH Q3B (R2) Impurities in New Drug Products and is 
well justified by real time data. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for 2 development/clinical and 2 production batches; results 
comply with the proposed specification demonstrating the consistency of the process. 
•  Stability of the Product 
The  stability  studies  were  carried  out  according  to  CPMP/ICH  stability  guidelines.  24  month  at 
30°C/60% RH stability data is available for 1 development and for 1 clinical batches, and 12 month  at 
30°C/60% RH  stability  data  is  available  for  a  third  one  (clinical  batch).  The  testing  includes 
appearance,  mean  mass,  impurities  and  degradation  products,  dissolution,  disintegration,  microbial 
contamination on packaged tablets and assay. All results comply with release specifications.  
7/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
The proposed container-closure system is not light-proof and photostability stress study has not been 
performed on the packaged tablets. But taking into account the proposed indication and presentation 
(one tablet per blister), it is unlikely that the drug product is exposed to light; therefore inclusion of the 
recommendation “Keep in the outer carton in order to protect from light” in the storage conditions of 
the tablets is sufficient. 
In general the results support the shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug  product  have 
been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  letter  of  Undertaking  and 
committed to resolve these as Follow Up Measures after the opinion, within the agreed timeframe.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
acetate 
(17α-Acetoxy-11β-(4-N,N-dimethylaminophenyl)-19-norpregna-4,9-diene-3,20-
Ulipristal 
dione,  also  known  as  CDB-2914,  VA2914,  HRP-2000  and  RTI-3021-012)  is  a  compound  that  is 
derived  from  19-norprogesterone.  It  is  a  synthetic  selective  progesterone  receptor  modulator  with 
antagonistic and partial agonistic effects at the progesterone receptor. It binds the human progesterone, 
but  not  the  estrogen  receptor3.  Ulipristal  acetate  prevents  progesterone  from  occupying  its  receptor, 
thus the gene transcription normally turned on by progesterone is blocked, and the proteins necessary 
to begin and maintain pregnancy are not synthesized. 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics  
The primary pharmacodynamic data originates both from academic and contract laboratories, often in 
the  form  of  publications  in  the  scientific  literature.  The  binding  of  ulipristal  acetate  to  hormonal 
steroid  receptors  has  been  investigated  in  a  number  of  studies  in  comparison  with  mifepristone,  as 
shown in the table below. The relative binding affinity (RBA) is compared to a value of 100% for the 
reference  agent  (progesterone  for  the  progesterone  receptor,  dexamethasone  for  the  glucocorticoid 
receptor, estradiol for the estrogen receptor, dihydrotestosterone or methyltrienolone for the androgen 
receptor).

Table: Summary of studies investigating the interaction of ulipristal acetate and mifepristone with 
steroid hormone receptors. 
Ulipristal  acetate  has  high  affinity  for  the  progesterone  and  glucocorticoid  receptor.  Weak  and 
negligible affinity was shown for the androgen, estrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors respectively.  
A receptor screen performed on 78 receptors showed some affinity of ulipristal acetate and its main 
metabolite  for  other  receptors  but  a  clinical  relevance  is  unlikely.  Binding  affinities  of  the 
monodemethylated  metabolite  of  ulipristal  acetate  for  the  progesterone  and  glucocorticoid  receptors 
are similar to the parent compound. 
In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  ulipristal  acetate  is  only  a  partial  antagonist  at  the  glucocorticoid 
receptor. The applicant describes that ulipristal acetate has agonistic activity at the PR-A isoform, and 
partial agonist/antagonist activity at the PR-B isoform. Although data about agonistic and antagonistic 
action are limited, in vitro results suggest that ulipristal acetate is a Selective Progesterone Receptor 
Modulator. 
The  in  vitro  progesterone  antagonistic  property  of  ulipristal  acetate  was  confirmed  in  vivo  were 
ulipristal  acetate  inhibited  progesterone  induced  endometrial  glandular  proliferation  in  rabbits.  No 
estrogenic  or  androgenic  activity  was  noted  by  ulipristal  acetate  but  a  modest  antiestrogenic  and 
antiandrogenic activity was observed. 
The  antiovulatory  and  antifertility  (post-coital)  activity  of  ulipristal  acetate  has  been  investigated  in 
rats  in  several  studies.  Ulipristal  acetate  has  a  dose-dependent  antiovulatory  effect  and  completely 
blocked ovulation at and above doses of 2 mg/kg. A partial blockade of ovulation was noted already at 
the lowest dose 0.5 mg/kg. The antifertility or post-coital effect was investigated in female rats that 
were mated with fertile males and dosed on day 4 to 6 of gestation. The animals were euthanized on 
day  10  of  gestation  and  the  number  of  concepti  was  recorded.  Ulipristal  acetate  at  doses  of  2.0 
mg/rat/day,  either  p.o.  or  s.c.,  prevented  pregnancy  in  all  animals  in  the  respective  groups  while  1 
mg/kg had a partial post-coital effect. In another dosing regimen with single 2 mg doses of ulipristal 
acetate to rats on different days of mating, no post-coital effect was observed on days 0, 1, 2 or 3 post-
mating, but prevented 100% of gestations on day 4 but with less effect on day 5.  
The applicant proposes several different mechanisms of action of the compound in humans: 
• 
• 
• 
ability to block, disrupt or delay ovulation 
ability to block or delay ovulation even after the onset of the LH surge 
ability to delay maturation of the endometrium likely resulting in prevention of implantation 
9/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Applicant’s view that the lack of effectiveness of ulipristal acetate administered to rats as a single 
oral  dose  of  2  mg  in  the  early  days  (0-3)  after  coitus  does  not  preclude  effectiveness  of  ulipristal 
acetate  as  an  emergency  contraceptive  in  humans  is  endorsed  by  the  CHMP  considering  the 
differences in fertilisation process between rats and humans.  
Administration  of  progesterone  to  ulipristal  acetate  treated  pregnant  rats  reversed  the  post-coital 
antifertility  effect  and  maintained  pregnancy.  It  can  therefore  be  concluded  that  the  prevention  of 
pregnancy  was  the  consequence  of  progesterone  antagonism.  A  dose-dependent  post-coital  effect  of 
ulipristal  acetate  was  observed  in  rabbits  when  the  animals  were  dosed  on  gestation  days  0-3.  A 
compete block of gestation was seen at 10 mg/kg and a partial block of gestation at 4 and 8 mg/kg. On 
days 4, 5 or 6, 32 mg/kg, had no or slight post-coital effect while 64 mg/kg totally blocked gestation in 
the rabbit. 
The  ability  of  ulipristal  acetate  to  terminate  pregnancies  was  investigated  in  the  guinea-pig  and 
monkey. Ulipristal, mifepristone and lilopristone were approximately equipotent at the dose levels of 
10 and 30 mg/day in terminating pregnancies in guinea-pigs when the animals were treated on days 43 
and 44 of gestation. Pregnant long-tailed macaques (5/group) were administered ulipristal acetate 0.5 
or 5 mg/kg/day p.o. or 0.5 mg/kg/day i.m. on days 23-26 of gestation. Pregnant animals were assessed 
by ultrasound pretreatment (day 23) and then monitored on days 26-28, 30, 32, 35, 55, 80, 100, 130 
and 145. At 0.5 mg/kg of ulipristal acetate there was no loss of foetuses, while at 5 mg/kg 2/5 foetuses 
were lost. When using intramuscular administration of 0.5 mg/kg 4/5 foetuses were lost in ulipristal 
acetate treated animals. In monkeys in which pregnancy continued and which were allowed to deliver 
normally, there was no evidence of structural or physiological abnormalities in foetuses.  
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Anti-glucocorticoid activity. 
Glucocorticoid  activity  as  measured  by  adrenal  function  was  investigated  in  rats.  Administration  of 
ulipristal acetate (62.5, 125, 250 mg/kg/day p.o. for 7 days) dose-relatedly increased adrenal weights. 
No effects were seen on pituitary weights or ACTH or corticosterone levels.  
Androgenic/anti-androgenic activity. 
Activity at the androgen receptor was studied in orchidectomised immature male rats. 
In  line  with  a  weak  affinity  for  the  androgen  receptor,  ulipristal  acetate  showed  a  modest  anti-
androgenic  effect  (dose-dependent  inhibition  of  testosterone  induced  increase  in  ventral  prostate 
weight). 
Effect of ulipristal acetate on cultured human uterine leiomyoma cells. 
The effect of ulipristal acetate on cultured leiomyoma cells was investigated in two studies. Ulipristal 
acetate  (10  nM-1  µM)  inhibited  the  proliferation  of  viable  cells  by  down-regulating  proliferating 
nuclear  cell  antigen  expression  and  inducing  apoptosis  by  up-regulating  cleaved  caspase-3  and 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase expression; Bcl-2 expression, which is controlled in leiomyoma cells by 
progesterone,  was  down-regulated.  Further  studies  in  leiomyoma  cells  showed  ulipristal  acetate  (10 
nM-1µM) to reduce the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors on 
cultured  leimoyoma  cells,  but  not  on  cultured  normal  endometrial  cells;  treatment  with  ulipristal 
acetate also altered the expression of progesterone isoform receptors (increased PR-A, decreased PR-
B) in leiomyoma cells, but not in normal myometrial cells. 
No  proliferation  was  observed  in  a  host  of  tumour  cell  lines  during  exposure  to  ulipristal  acetate  is 
reassuring, but does not rule out the possibility of increased progesterone induced proliferation due to 
the increased expression of PR. The Applicant was requested to further evaluate this aspect. 
The data on leiomyoma cells only reports the expression profile after 48 hours of exposure. Study of 
the expression profiles of endometrial stromal cells using different exposure times, 8, 18 and 36 hours, 
suggests  that  expression  of  both  PR  isoforms  is  reduced  after  18  hours  of  exposures,  and  increases 
after 36 hours of exposure. It is therefore likely that a relatively long exposure time is needed before 
PR expression is increased.

It is considered unlikely, after a single dose of Ellaone, that cells are exposed for an amount of time 
that is sufficient to induce increased expression of PR. 
Effect of ulipristal acetate on endometrial stromal cells. 
Treatment  of  cell  cultures  with  100  µM  ulipristal  acetate  significantly  inhibited  estrogen  and 
progesterone stimulated proliferation of endometrial stromal cells. Lower concentrations were without 
effect.  Expression  levels  of  AR,  PR-A,  PR-B,  Fas  and  FasL  were  all  increased in  cells  treated  with 
ulipristal acetate, as were protein levels of AR, but not ERα or ERβ. 
•  Pharmacodynamics of metabolites 
The pharmacodynamic activity of metabolites to ulipristal acetate was investigated in limited in vitro 
and in vivo studies. The main metabolites of ulipristal acetate, the mono-N-demethylated (CDB-3877) 
and di-N-demethylated (CDB-3963) were both found to be pharmacologically active, with CDB-3877 
having  the  greater  affinity  at  the  progesterone  receptor  of  similar  magnitude  as ulipristal  acetate. In 
vivo, CDB-3877 inhibited endometrial proliferation after oral administration with lower magnitude of 
efficacy than ulipristal acetate while CDB-3963 was only weakly active.

Ulipristal acetate did not produce any unexpected or toxic effects in the safety pharmacology studies, 
which were conducted in accordance with ICH S7A and S7B. The only effect of relevance for humans 
is an increased arterial blood pressure observed in conscious female beagle dogs at 25 and 125 mg/kg, 
resulting  in  exposure  margins  of  14  and  133,  respectively.  The  systemic  exposure  at  NOAEL  (5 
mg/kg)  is  slightly  below  clinical  exposure.  Considering  the  proposed  single  dose  administration  to 
young individuals, the clinical relevance of the observed effect is assessed as low. 
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant states that due to the wide range of products that might be taken simultaneously with 
ulipristal acetate, and due to the rapid decrease in relevant plasma levels, it is justified that no studies 
were performed. This was agreed by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Assays for ulipristal acetate have been developed based on radioimmunoassay (RIA) and LC-MS/MS 
techniques. The RIA method relied on antisera raised in rabbits following sensitisation with ulipristal 
acetate  3-carboxymethyloxime  and  bovine  serum  albumin.  The  antiserum  was  shown  to  cross-react 
with  the  N-monodemethylated  metabolite  of  ulipristal  acetate  (CDB-3877)  for  76%  and  to  a  lesser 
degree with the N-didemethylated metabolite (CDB-3963) (59%). The RIA assay was used to support 
the  initial  pharmacokinetic  studies  and  also  the  toxicokinetic  analyses.  LC-MS/MS  methods  were 
developed to support the safety pharmacology studies in rat and dog. No direct comparison between 
the RIA and LC-MS/MS methods can be performed,  as the levels measured with the RIA assay are 
higher  than  using  the  LC-MS/MS  method,  because  ulipristal  acetate  and  two  of  its  metabolites  are 
measured  with  the  RIA  method  versus  ulipristal  acetate  alone  with  the  LC-MS/MS  method.  In 
addition,  the  comparison  between  the  two  analysis  methods  is  not  possible,  because  the  unit  of  the 
RIA method is pg/tube and with the LC-MS/MS method ng/ml.

The exposure appeared to be less than proportional over the dose range 5 to 
125 mg/kg for both ulipristal acetate and the metabolite CDB-3877 in rats 
but the converse was seen in dogs. When analysed by RIA, exposure of rats 
and rabbits increased less than proportionally over the dose range 50-1250 
mg/kg.

Highly protein bound (96.7-99.5%) to plasma proteins of mouse, rat, rabbit,

14C-ulipristal was widely distributed in rats and monkeys. Higher 
concentrations of radioactivity were seen in pigmented tissues (uveal tract, 
pigmented skin and meninges).  
No human data on excretion into milk.

monkeys. In vivo metabolism data in humans are very limited. 
Rats and monkey: main route via faeces (83.3-44.7%).  
Biliary excretion was observed in the rats.  
Human: poorly characterised (no human mass balance study available), 
main elimination route likely via metabolism. 
Absorption 
Ulipristal acetate was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration to mice, rats, rabbits, dogs 
and monkeys. Following oral administration of 5 mg/kg of  14C-ulipristal acetate to rats and monkeys 
Cmax  was  observed  at  1  and  4  hours,  respectively,  after  dosing.  Results  obtained  by  LC-MS/MS 
following  oral  dosing  to  rats  and  dogs  at  dose  levels  of  5,  25  and  125  mg/kg  confirmed  the  rapid 
absorption (Tmax of 1-5 hours in rats, 1-2 hours in dogs). Despite very limited data and differences in 
analysis techniques, it appears that the Cmax and AUC are approximately dose proportional. 
Comparisons of exposure after intravenous and oral administration gave bioavailability figures of 80 
and  113%  in  rats  and  monkeys,  respectively.  Studies  in  monkeys  with  assay  by  RIA  confirmed  the 
good  bioavailability.  The  applicant  showed 
the 
bioavailability ulipristal acetate in monkey. In addition, data in rat showed that the feeding status of 
the  animal  influenced  the  bioavailability  of  ulipristal  acetate,  with  a  lower  bioavailability  in  fed 
animals  than  in  fasted  animals.  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  statement  of  the  applicant  that  the 
absorption of ulipristal acetate is pH-dependent and may be reduced in situations where gastric pH is 
increased irrespective of cause. 
that  different  oral  formulation 
influenced 
Distribution 
Ulipristal  acetate  was  highly  bound  (96.7-99.5%)  to  plasma  proteins  of  mouse,  rat,  rabbit,  dog, 
monkey  and  human;  studies  with  human  protein  fractions  showed  a  major  role  of  α1-acid 
glycoprotein.  In  addition,  ulipristal  acetate  is  also  highly  bound  in  blood  (4.86%  to  blood  cells  and 
94.09% to plasma proteins).  
Following  intravenous  and  oral  administration  of  14C-ulipristal  acetate  to  rats  and  monkeys, 
radioactivity was widely distributed. In rats, concentrations of radioactivity declined after peak levels, 
but quantifiable radioactivity levels were still present in all tissues at the final sampling time of 3 days. 
In  addition,  in  monkeys  even  after  14  days  radioactivity  was  measurable  in  all  investigated  tissues. 
The liver accounted for the majority of radioactivity in the tissues in the distribution studies in rat and 
monkey. However, ulipristal acetate also showed a high tissue to plasma ratio in the kidney, clitoris, 
ovary,  uterus,  adrenal,  fat,  uveal tract,  pigmented  skin  and  mucosa  of  the  gastro-intestinal  tract, 
indicating accumulation in these organs if the drug is used again a month later. Most likely this has no 
implications, because ulipristal acetate is given as a single dose, but in repeated dose this could result 
in toxicity due to accumulation. 
Metabolism 
Metabolism of ulipristal acetate was investigated in vitro in liver microsomal preparations from mice, 
rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys and humans. All species produced the same two major metabolites, but 
the proportions varied between species. Some minor metabolites were detected in the animal species 
which were not detected with human microsomes. No metabolites were detected that were unique to 
13/49 
 
 
 
 
 
humans.  The  in vivo  metabolism  data  in  humans  are  very  limited. The  active  metabolite  3877A  has 
been measured; however, no human mass balance study is available.  
In  studies  with  Supersome™,  the  metabolism  of  ulipristal  acetate  was  predominantly  mediated  by 
CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in vitro 
examined the potential for ulipristal acetate to inhibit a range of CYP isozymes. Ulipristal acetate did 
not  inhibit  marker  enzyme  activities  for  CYP1A2,  CYP2C19  or  CYP2E1  at  any  concentration 
evaluated.  Inhibition  of  CYP2C9,  CYP2D6  and  CYP3A4  activity  was  observed  only  at  the  highest 
concentration (100 µM, 47.56 µg/mL) although the extent of this inhibition is indicative of very weak 
inhibitors.  Concomitant  administration  of  ulipristal  acetate  with  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e.g. 
ketoconazole,  itraconazole,  ritonavir,  telithromycin,  clarithromycin,  nefazodone)  may  inhibit  the 
metabolism  of  ulipristal  acetate  and  cause  increased  plasma  levels.  In  addition,  concomitant 
administration  with  potent  CYP3A4 
rifampicin,  phenytoin,  phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine, Hypericum perforatum/St John’s wort) may reduce plasma concentrations of ulipristal 
acetate and may result in decrease in efficacy.

(e.g. 
Excretion 
Studies  examining  plasma,  urine,  faeces  and,  in  rats  only,  bile  after  oral  and  intravenous 
administration to rats and monkeys identified a large number of metabolites – up to 28 in rat and 20 in 
monkeys.  Following  administration  of  14C-ulipristal  acetate  to  rats  and  monkeys,  excretion  of 
radioactivity was predominantly faecal. After oral dosing of 5 mg/kg, faeces accounted for 83.3% of 
the  administered radioactivity  and  urine 2.4%;  corresponding  figures  for  the  monkey  were  44.7  and 
6.3% (total recovery of radioactivity was much lower in the monkey, 69.7%, as compared to the rat, 
93.2%). In bile duct cannulated rats, bile accounted for 61.5% of the administered dose with a further 
28.8 and 4.0% found in faeces and urine, respectively. 
Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
In single dose toxicity studies, only one dose of ulipristal acetate (1250 mg/kg) was investigated in rats 
and rabbits, which was far in excess of the human dose (140-fold and 197-fold based on Cmax values 
for rats and rabbits respectively). The apparent LD50 was <1250 mg/kg in the rat and >1250 mg/kg in 
the  rabbit.  Although  more  dose  levels  were  used  in  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  single  dose 
administration is the more appropriate dosing scheme for this indication. More dose levels should have 
been investigated to allow assessment of any risks relevant for humans. However, due to the fact that 
no unexpected toxicity was evident in the repeat dose studies, no further single dose toxicity studies 
are required. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
The  pivotal  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  are  considered  to  be  the  6-month  studies  in  the  rat  and 
cynomolgus monkey. These are supported by 14-day preliminary studies in the rat and rhesus monkey. 
Toxicokinetic measures were included in all studies. There was no investigation of recovery following 
cessation of dosing in any of these studies. Dosing was oral with ulipristal acetate suspended in ASV: 
0.9% sodium chloride, 0.4% polysorbate 80, 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and 0.9% benzyl alcohol in 
distilled or deionised water. 
Administration  of  ulipristal  acetate  (1,  5  and  25  mg/kg/day)  to  rats  in  the  6-month  toxicity  study 
caused  changes  in  haematological  (increased  white  cell,  lymphocyte  and  neutrophils;  reduced 
erythrocyte  numbers,  haematocrit  and  haemoglobin)  and  biochemical  (reduced  sodium,  chloride; 
increased globulin, total protein and cholesterol) parameters. Organ weight analysis showed increased 
liver and adrenal weights and decreased ovaries, uterus and thyroid weights at the 5 and 25 mg/kg/day 
dose  levels.  On  histological  examination,  these  correlated  with  adrenal  cortical and  liver  hepatocyte 
hypertrophy,  ovarian  follicular  cysts  and  follicular  atresia  and  uterine  glandular  dilation:  pituitary 
hyperplasia and mammary galactoceles were also noted. These histological changes were most notable 
14/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in animals treated with 5 or 25 mg/kg/day but the changes in mammary glands and ovaries were also 
seen at 1 mg/kg/day. There was a significant positive correlation between pituitary weights and serum 
prolactin  levels  and  between  adrenal  weights  and  serum  corticosterone  levels.  Treatment-related 
changes were seen at all dose levels and it was not possible to determine a NOEL in this study.  
The 14-day study in rhesus monkeys had only two dose levels, 20 and 100 mg/kg/day. Two animals in 
the high-dose group were particularly affected by treatment with one animal euthanized on day 8. No 
treatment-related changes in haematology parameters were observed while high-dose animals showed 
changes  in  some  biochemistry  parameters  which  are  considered  of  low  clinical  relevance.  Serum 
cortisol levels showed a general trend of increasing values in the high-dose group. Organ weights were 
increased in the high-dose group for liver, thyroid and heart and, for animals in both treated groups, in 
the spleen, adrenals, ovaries and kidneys. A dose related increase in mucous cells in the cervix in low- 
and  high-dose  groups  and  a  decreased  bone  marrow  cellularity  in  two  high-dose  animals  were 
observed at histopathology.  
The 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted at dose levels of 1, 5 and 25 mg/kg/day. 
Administration  of  ulipristal  acetate  disrupted  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis  with  increased 
cortisol  and  prolactin  levels.  Although  hormone  levels  were  altered  at  all  dose  levels,  the 
consequences  were  most  apparent  at  the  5  and  25  mg/kg/day  dose  levels.  The  menstrual  cycle  was 
disrupted  in  mid-  and  high-dose  animals  with  some  high-dose  animals  being  acyclic  throughout  the 
study. Lymphocyte numbers were reduced and neutrophil numbers increased at these dose levels; this 
might  be  expected  as  a  consequence  of  the  increased  circulating  cortisol  levels  resulting  from 
disruption  of  the  feedback  mechanisms  controlling  the  release  of  ACTH.  Adrenal  weights  were 
increased in high-dose animals (there was a significant correlation between adrenal weights and serum 
cortisol levels), consistent with the hypertrophy observed at histology; although thymus weights were 
decreased  at  this  dose  level,  there  were  no  histological  correlates.  Histology  also  showed  cystic 
dilatation  of  uterine  endometrial  glands  in  mid-  and  high-dose  animals,  with  one  high-dose  animal 
showing mild squamous metaplasia. 
Apart from the effects on the liver, which might be due to increased metabolic load, all effects have 
been  seen  after  long-term  treatment  with  other  hormones,  and  can  be  explained  by  an  exaggerated 
pharmacodynamic effect. 
•  Genotoxicity 
The  standard  genotoxicity  battery  was  performed  and  results  were  negative.  The  doses  used  in  the 
main  in  vivo  micronucleus  test  were  determined  from  the  results  from  adequate  dose  range  finding 
studies. In vivo exposure in the mouse micronucleus study has been confirmed by radioactivity. 
There is no evidence of genotoxic potential of ulipristal acetate.  
•  Carcinogenicity 
No long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed. Ulipristal acetate is used as a single dose, 
and carcinogenicity testing is therefore considered not necessary. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
The programme of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies conducted with ulipristal acetate 
have  focused  on  embryofoetal  development  using  standard  dosing  periods  in  rats  and  rabbits  and 
possible effects on pups from dams which were dosed during the early days of pregnancy. Doses in 
these studies were low so as to provide data at levels which did not impair pregnancy. There were no 
toxicokinetic  measures incorporated  into these  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies. The 
studies were according to the Applicant not intended to provide safety margins in terms of exposure, 
but to give data to guide on the consequences of ulipristal acetate administration at dose levels which 
allowed pregnancies to continue.

Ulipristal acetate has no effect on male fertility. 
As expected, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic at low doses, when given to rats and rabbits in repeated 
doses at gestation days 6-17 or 6-18 respectively. Considering the pharmacodynamics of the product 
and the indication applied for, the most important effects to consider are those in live foetuses, and the 
applicant has chosen a dose in the embryo/foetal studies that allows sufficient foetuses to survive for 
examination. In rats and rabbits, no effects in live foetuses were observed at doses up to 1 mg/kg/day 
in the pivotal studies. 
In the pup development study, effects on fertility and litter size are as expected. Equal to the embryo-
foetal  development  studies,  considering  the  pharmacodynamics  of  the  product  and  the  indication 
applied  for,  the  most  important  effects  to  consider  are  those  in  surviving  offspring.  When  dosed  at 
GD0-3 with up to 4 mg/kg/day, no effects were observed in the offspring of rats. Apart from the study 
in macaques where no effects on surviving offspring were evident after dosing on days 23-26, other 
robust  data  on  surviving  offspring  of  animals  dosed  after  GD-3  is  not  available.  It  has  not  been 
possible to evaluate the teratogenic potential of ulipristal acetate since the doses are low in order to 
maintain gestation of the animals. 
The applicant has committed to perform a pre- and postnatal development study. The results of this 
study are awaited to assess the effects of possible off-label use after the first 5 days post-coital.  
•  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic measures were included in all studies. These were often minimal in terms of sampling 
times but they did serve to substantiate the exposure of the animals to ulipristal acetate and allow some 
comparisons to be made to the exposure levels reached in clinical use of ulipristal acetate.  
There  are  deficiencies  in  the  toxicokinetic  documentation  with  different  assay  methodologies  used 
(RIA in animals, LC-MS/MS in humans) which hampers an comparison between animals and humans. 
In the rat, no exposure margin exists while in the pivotal 6 month toxicity study in the Cynomolgus 
monkey, an exposure margin above clinical exposure was obtained. The toxicokinetic documentation 
was  however  accepted  considering  that  the  obtained  toxicity  findings  can  be  explained  by  an 
exaggerated  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  ulipristal  and  the  proposed  single  dose  administration  of 
ulipristal.

fibroblasts using the neutral red uptake assay has been performed (study HRA2914-448). The highest 
concentration  of  ulipristal  acetate  used  was  limited  by  solubility.  When  tested  up  to  the  limit  of 
solubility, ulipristal acetate was not phototoxic. 
No other toxicity studies have been performed. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A Phase I  ERA based on the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) adopted by CHMP on 01 June 2006 was 
provided. 
The Applicant concluded that the calculated concentration for PECSurface water is less than the 0.01 µg/L 
threshold value given in the CHMP guideline, and that the release into the environment of ulipristal 
acetate following the prescribed use of Ellaone is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment. This 
was not accepted by CHMP because ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator 
with the potential to affect the reproductive outcome in many species, making the action limit of 0.01 
µg/L  potentially  not  applicable.  A  phase  II  environmental  risk  assessment  was requested,  which the 
applicant  has  committed  to  perform.  A  tailored  risk  assessment  strategy  should  be  followed  that 
addresses the specific mechanism of action.    
Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  vivo  pharmacology  results  show  that  ulipristal  acetate  has  antiprogesterone  activity  shown  as 
inhibition  of  progesterone induced endometrial  glandular  proliferation in the  anti-McGinty  and  anti-
Clauberg  tests.  The  monodemethylated  metabolite  has  modest  activity  in  the  anti-Clauberg  test. 
Ulipristal  acetate  seems  most  potent  after  oral  administration.  The  modest  antiuterotropic  effect 
observed  in  rats  is  most  likely  due  to  anti-progestational  activity  through  the  progesterone  receptor, 
since  ulipristal  acetate  has  no  affinity  for  the  estrogen  receptor.  An  anti-estrogen  effect  of  ulipristal 
acetate is therefore highly unlikely.

Ulipristal acetate was shown to be effective in inhibiting ovulation and preventing pregnancy in rats. 
When  given  to  guinea  pigs  and  macaques  at  later  stages  of  pregnancy,  ulipristal  acetate  terminated 
gestation in some animals. However, these endpoints are not relevant for the current indication applied 
for. The most relevant dosing scheme in relation to a clinical setting, is a single administration on the 
first  few  days  post-coital.  In  rats,  efficacy  was  only  shown  for  dosing  after  day  4.  In  rabbits  single 
doses were only investigated after day 4, in which a high dose was necessary to achieve a reduction on 
pregnancy rates. Pre-clinical efficacy at days 0-3 using single dose has not been shown, presumably 
due to differences in fertilisation process between preclinical species and humans. 
Pharmacodynamic studies performed in vivo, and reproduction toxicity studies, clearly demonstrated 
that repeated doses above 1 mg/kg to rats and rabbits cause embryolethality. Doses below 1 mg/kg are 
so low that malformations/variations are difficult to investigate in the animal species. There are data in 
rats  and  monkeys  which  indicate  no  adverse  effect  of  ulipristal  acetate  when  the  embryo/foetus  is 
exposed  during  early  gestation,  however,  due to  a  small  number  of  animals  and  low  doses  used,  no 
conclusion for human safety could be drawn from these studies.  
The  CHMP  requested  additional  information  on  human  in vivo  metabolism  data  due  to  the  need  to 
assess the relevance of the animal species used in reproduction toxicity studies. It was agreed that for 
this indication with only single dose administration on single occasions, the requirements for human 
pharmacokinetic data may be lowered compared with a product intended for chronic administration. 
The main safety concern with ulipristal acetate at the proposed therapeutic use is the potential adverse 
effects on an embryo that develops to term due to a failed emergency contraception. The applicant was 
asked  to  summarise  all  available  data  and  include  a  discussion  on  exposure  margins  at  the  tested 
doses.   
It can be concluded that, due to hormonal differences, the rodent species are probably less relevant. 
Focus was therefore on data in primates which was summarised in the SPC section 5.3. 
The  safety  concerns  relating  to  an  embryolethal  and  teratogenic  potential  of  ulipristal  acetate  are 
therefore considered addressed with appropriate changes to the SPC. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Ellaone  contains  ulipristal  acetate,  a  synthetic  selective  progesterone  receptor  modulator  with 
antagonistic and partial agonistic effects, as claimed by the applicant, at the progesterone receptor. An 
effective emergency contraceptive method has the potential to help out women, who might otherwise 
have become pregnant, thereby possibly reducing the need for abortion.  
Currently,  the  standard  of  care  for  emergency  contraception  is  the  administration  of  1.5  mg  of 
levonorgestrel within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.  
It should be noted that levonorgestrel is only registered for the time frame of 0-72 hours, as there is 
limited  evidence  of  efficacy  after  72  hours  after  UPI.  Longer  duration  of  efficacy,  beyond  the 
approved margin of levonorgestrel would be an advantage. 
Normal sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract and retain the ability to fertilize an egg for 
at least 3 and up to 5 days, but an oocyte can be successfully fertilized for only approximately 12-24 
hours  after  it  is  released.4  Although  not  specifically  stated  it  is  assumed  that  for  this  reason  several 
published emergency contraception studies in women are conducted up to maximally 120 hours after 
UPI.5

This  submission  is  based  on  six  phase  I  studies  conducted  to  determine  the  pharmacodynamic  and 
pharmacokinetic  properties  of  ulipristal  acetate  and  three  efficacy  and  safety  studies.  The  National 
Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) initiated the clinical development phase 
for  use  as  an  emergency  contraception.  The  applicant,  HRA  Pharma,  licensed  the  rights  to  the 
compound  in  2000.  For  this  reason,  data  for  three  out  of  four  pharmacodynamic  studies  are  only 
available as publication.  
The efficacy and safety studies submitted in support of the emergency contraception indication were 
two  pivotal  phase-II  multicenter,  double-blind,  active-controlled  clinical  studies  and  one  pivotal 
phase-III uncontrolled study, as shown in the table below.

Currently,  there  is  an  ongoing  double-blind,  active-controlled  phase  III  study  (HRA2914-513), 
conducted  by  HRA  Pharma,  which  compares  30  mg  micronized  ulipristal  acetate  with  1.5  mg 
levonorgestrel. The protocol calls for inclusion of 2,000 subjects in this study and the study report will 
be submitted by July 2009. 
Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
The applicant has submitted a PIP to the EMEA on 24 July 2008 (EMEA-000305-PIP-01). The EMEA 
Paediatric  Committee  in  its  meeting  of  4-6  March  2009  adopted  a  positive  opinion  on  this  PIP, 
agreeing the following clinical studies: 
•  Single-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  parallel  group  safety  and  efficacy  study  of  ulipristal 
acetate 30 mg versus levonorgestrel 1.5 mg for emergency contraception within 120 hours of 
unprotected intercourse, in adolescents (and in adults). 
•  Open-label, observational safety study of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception within 
120 hours of unprotected intercourse, in adolescents (and in adults). 
19/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The opinion of the Paediatric Committee also included certain measures to monitor safety, including 
follow-up of any pregnancy, occurring in treated patients, until delivery or termination, and a study in 
rats from day 6 of gestation to day 21 of lactation. 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  information  submitted  by  the  applicant  is  limited.  Only  two  studies  and  one 
article  with  respect  to  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ulipristal  acetate  were  submitted  by  the  applicant 
(HRA2914-501, HRA2914-503 and HRA2914-504). 
Two analytical methods were used. Firstly, a RIA method was used that was not specific for the parent 
compound alone. Also the metabolites did show a cross reaction with this method. Secondly, a LC-
MS/MS  method  was  developed,  which  could  determine  both  the  parent  compound  and  the  main 
metabolite (3877A) in human plasma. 
•  Absorption  
The applicant did not investigate the absolute bioavailability of ulipristal acetate in humans nor was it 
discussed in the clinical overview in the initially submitted dossier. Therefore the extent of absorption 
of  ulipristal  acetate  was  not  known.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  give  a  justification  for  not 
conducting an absolute bioavailability study and to provide information on the extent of absorption of 
ulipristal acetate. 
The CHMP concluded that the plasma levels of ulipristal acetate reached with the 30 mg to-be-
marketed micronised tablet formulation should approximate those achieved with the 50 mg crystalline 
capsule evaluated in the Phase II program and allow extrapolation of the safety and efficacy results 
from the two Phase II studies (HRA2914-507 and HRA2914-508). 
With respect to the influence of food on bioavailability, a study submitted in the answers to the day 
120 report investigated absorption of ulipristal acetate from the commercial 30 mg Ellaone tablet in 
the fasting state and after a high-fat meal. It was shown that there was no dramatic effect of food on 
the  exposure  of  ulipristal  acetate  and  its  active  metabolite.  Mean  Cmax  of  ulipristal  acetate  was 
decreased by approximately 44%,  median Tmax was delayed from 0.75 to 3 hours and AUC0-∞  was 
increased by approximately 26%. Similar results were observed for the active metabolite 3877A, with 
about 38% decrease in Cmax and 20% increase in AUC.  
In the clinical studies, there were no food restrictions, as patients were dosed as soon as possible when 
they came to the study site and were in need of emergency contraception. Analyses of results based on 
subjects who had reported food intake within 2 hours before treatment vs. the overall study population 
were  presented.  Based  on  a  small  amount  of  data,  no  difference  in  pregnancy  rate  was  observed 
between those groups, although the confidence interval was wide.  
The  applicant  concluded  that  the  recommendation  in  section  4.2  should  be  that  Ellaone  can  be 
administered with or without food. The modest increase in AUC is not likely to be a safety concern. 
The decrease in Cmax was relatively large, though. The mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate in the 
prevention  of  pregnancy  is  not  completely  elucidated,  i.e.  it  is  unknown  whether  the  effect  is 
dependent  on  reaching  a  certain  threshold  concentration  or  if  the  total  exposure  is  of  greater 
importance. The  clinical  relevance  of the  observed  food  effect is  difficult to  exactly  predict.  Cmax  is 
decreased  while  the  overall  systemic  exposure  is  somewhat  higher  in  the  fed  state.  However,  since 
Ellaone  was  administered  regardless  of  previous  food  intake  in  the  clinical  study  and  since  it  is  of 
20/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
importance  that  Ellaone  is  administered  as  soon  as  possible  after  an  unprotected  intercourse,  the 
recommendation proposed by the applicant was endorsed by CHMP.  
•  Distribution 
Ulipristal  acetate  is  mainly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  (99%).  The  volume  of  distribution  was  not 
estimated. Results from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study HRA2914-504 show that plasma levels 
of ulipristal acetate and its metabolite achieve peak concentrations less than one hour after intake and 
decrease  rapidly  thereafter.  At  12h  after  intake,  concentrations  decrease  to  well  below  5%  of  peak 
concentrations. 
In the absence of specific data on the distribution of ulipristal acetate into milk, initial guidance for 
clinical  recommendations  can  be  drawn  from  the  plasma  pharmacokinetic  profile.  Therefore,  in  the 
SPC it is stated that “It is unknown whether ulipristal acetate is excreted in human or animal breast 
milk. Ulipristal acetate is a lipophilic compound and may theoretically be excreted in breast milk. A 
risk  to  the  breast-fed  child  cannot  be  excluded.  After  intake  of  Ellaone  breastfeeding  is  not 
recommended for at least 36 hours”. 
Additionally, results of ulipristal acetate transfer into milk in the rat peri-postnatal study are awaited. 
Furthermore,  pending  confirmation  on  this  study  the  applicant  also  committed  to  conduct  a  study 
investigating  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ulipristal  acetate  in  healthy  breastfeeding  women  who  take 
30mg and the amount of drug transferred into human milk, similar to the design of the study published 
for levonorgestrel (Gainer et al, 2007). If necessary, the applicant will propose a variation to update 
the SPC once the results are available. 
•  Elimination 
The half life of ulipristal acetate is approximately 32h and the Cl/F 77l/h.  
In preclinical studies in rats and monkey’s after administration of radiolabeled drugs intravenously the 
main route of excretion was the faeces and only a minor part (< 10%) was excreted in urine. 
In vitro studies show that the metabolism of ulipristal acetate is mediated by mainly CYP3A4 and two 
metabolites  are  formed.  Only  one  metabolite  is  analyzed  in  plasma  samples  of  the  pharmacokinetic 
studies. Lack of information related to interactions and special populations (i.e. patients with renal or 
hepatic  impairment)  was  dealt  with  appropriate  information  in  the  SPC,  for  instance  not 
recommending the use of Ellaone in patients treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.  
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  issue  of  linearity  and  comparability  between  the  micronised/unmicronised  formulation  is 
discussed in the Absorption section. 
The lack of formal dose proportionality studies is considered acceptable as only one strength is applied 
for. 
As the product is only administered once, time dependency of the pharmacokinetics is considered not 
applicable for this product. 
•  Special populations 
From  the  preclinical  studies  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  excretion  in  urine  is  less  than  10%  of  the 
absorbed  dose.  Therefore,  renal  impairment  will  therefore  probably  not  influence  the  exposure  to 
ulipristal acetate in a clinical significant way. 
Ulipristal  acetate  is  metabolised  by  cytochrome  P450  co-enzymes  in  the  liver.  Therefore,  liver 
impairment can influence the pharmacokinetics of ulipristal acetate in a significant way. However, as 
21/49 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ellaone  is  administered  only  once  and  most  likely  to  healthy  young  females  liver  impairment  will 
probably not influence the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate in a clinically significant way. 
Regarding the administration to adolescents, please refer to the section on the paediatric investigation 
plan (PIP). 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  interaction  studies  were  submitted  and  in  the  SPC  is  only  mentioned  that  potent  CYP3A4 
inhibitors  may  increase  the  exposure  and  inducers  may  reduce  plasma  concentrations  of  ulipristal 
acetate.  However,  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products  may  influence  the  efficacy  of  this 
product, especially if the product is administered with a CYP3A4 inducer. This was addressed in the 
SPC  with  a  warning  regarding  concomitant  contraceptive  use  and  the  need  of  additional  barrier 
contraceptive methods until the following period. 
Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
Ulipristal  acetate  is  a  synthetic  Selective  Progesterone  Receptor  Modulator  (SPRM).  In  vitro, 
Ulipristal acetate binds competitively to the progesterone, glucocorticoid and androgen receptors, but 
has minimal affinity for the estrogen or mineralocorticoid receptors. Pre-clinical studies indicate that 
ulipristal  acetate  binds  to  the  human  progesterone,  glucocorticoid  and  androgen  receptors  at 
approximately 6, 1.5 and 0.2 times the affinity of the endogenous ligands.  
The  compound  has  antiprogestational  activity  in  rats,  rabbits  and  monkeys,  with  additional 
antiglucocorticoid  and  antiandrogen  activity  at  doses  ∼50  times  higher  than  those  needed  for 
antiprogestational activity. Since progesterone is critical for implantation, it was thought that ulipristal 
acetate may have promise as a contraceptive agent.  
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Single-dose studies 
Three  single-dose  pharmacodynamic  studies  were  performed  with  unmicronized  ulipristal  acetate  in 
support  of  the  indication  by  assessing  the  effect  on  endometrial  maturation  and  the  inhibition  of 
ovulation  in  the  mid-luteal  phase  (HRA2914-503),  mid-follicular  phase  (HRA2914-505)  and  early-
luteal phase (HRA2914-506). All studies were carried out in women, who agreed to use mechanical or 
sterilization methods of contraception throughout the study. 
•  Mid-luteal administration of ulipristal acetate resulted in early endometrial bleeding, indicating a 
direct action on the endometrium. Despite the small number of women, the study clearly showed 
that a dose of 200 mg is too high, due to the side effects of prolonged bleeding (two women had a 
dramatic increase in length of bleeding of 15 and 20 days). The 200 mg dose was omitted from 
HRA2914-505 and HRA2914-506. 
•  At mid-follicular phase, doses of 10-100 mg ulipristal acetate caused a suppression of growth of 
the lead follicle and subsequent delay in ovulation that was greatest at the highest doses (50 and 
100 mg), but inhibited luteal phase endometrial maturation similarly at all doses. The threshold for 
altering endometrial morphology thus appears lower than for inhibition of ovulation. 
•  At  early-luteal  phase,  none  of  the  given  doses  (10,  50  and  100  mg)  affected  the  length  of  the 
follicular, luteal or overall cycle length during the baseline, treatment or post-treatment menstrual 
cycle.  A  significant  delay  in  endometrial  maturation  occurred  in  the  50  and  100  mg  groups 
compared to the placebo and 10 mg groups (p=0.02). 
The dose of 50 mg unmicronized ulipristal acetate was chosen in the phase II studies, since this was 
the minimal dose that alters endometrial maturation and induces inhibition of ovulation.  
22/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since  the  single-dose  studies  were  performed  by  the NICHD  and  data  were  only  available  from  the 
publications,  limited  data  are  available  regarding  the  adverse  effects.  Ulipristal  acetate  at  10-50  mg 
appears  to  be  well  tolerated.  Post-treatment  cycle  characteristics  were  comparable  to  baseline.  The 
side  effects  nausea,  headache  and  abdominal  pain  were  noted  during  12-weeks  administration 
(HRA2914-510), but no mention is made of these side effects after single-dose administration. 
Furthermore,  a  dose-response  relation  was  observed  between  the  ulipristal  acetate  dose  and  the 
presence of cysts in the single-dose HRA2914-505 study and the multiple-dose HRA2914-510 study. 
It is important to know whether these cysts disappear after single-dose administration. In the majority 
of the subjects this was the case, but not in all women and some women even required surgery. This is 
discussed further in the Safety section. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances were not studied. 
In  conclusion, the  mechanism  of  action,  as  claimed  in  5.1  of  the  SPC  “The  primary  mechanism  of 
action is thought to be inhibition or delay of ovulation, but alterations to the endometrium may also 
contribute to the efficacy of the product”, is sufficiently documented. 
Clinical efficacy  
•  Dose response studies 
Dose  selection  The  50  mg  unmicronized  ulipristal  acetate  dose  selected  for  both  phase  II  studies 
(HRA2914-507 and HRA2914-508) was based on the aforementioned pharmacodynamic studies.  
Design  and  results  Two  phase  II  studies  evaluated  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  ulipristal  acetate  for 
emergency contraception when taken 0-72h after UPI.  
The  HRA2914-507  study  was  designed  as  a  non-inferiority  trial  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  50  mg 
unmicronized ulipristal acetate has a pregnancy rate no worse than that of 2 x 0.75 mg levonorgestrel 
with  a  noninferiority  margin  (δ)  of  2%.  At  the  2.5%  level  of  significance  (upper  limit  of  the  95% 
confidence  interval),  a  sample  size  of  770  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  was  sufficient  to  reject 
with  80%  statistical  power  the  null  hypothesis.  For  the  mITT  population,  the  pregnancy  rate  in 
ulipristal  acetate  group  was  1.52%  (0.785-2.632).  This  trial  demonstrated  that  50  mg  unmicronized 
ulipristal acetate was at least as effective as levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive (-0.27, 95% 
CI  -1.992,  1.420  for  the  mITT  population),  as  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  was 
below  2%.  The  pregnancy  rate  and  prevented  fraction  for  the  EE  population  administered  ulipristal 
acetate were, respectively, 0.91% (0.365-1.857) and 85% (68-93). 
The HRA2914-508 study was also set up as a non-inferiority trial with a margin (δ) of 2.5%. The data 
showed that 10 mg micronized ulipristal acetate was inferior to 50 mg unmicronized ulipristal acetate 
at preventing pregnancy (1.44, 95% CI -0.660, 3.820). The upper limit of the 95% CI of the pregnancy 
rate (2.74%) of 10 mg micronized ulipristal acetate was beyond the clinically unacceptable threshold 
of 4%, i.e. 4.985%. The pregnancy rate and prevented fraction for the EE population administered 50 
mg  ulipristal  acetate  were  respectively  1.30%  (0.423-3.016)  and  76.19%  (52.83-91.78).  For  10  mg 
micronized ulipristal acetate the prevented fraction was 52.38% (29.78-74.29). 
•  Main study: Study HRA2914-509 
This Phase III, prospective, open-label, single-arm study, conducted in 45 centres in the United States, 
was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of  30 mg micronized ulipristal 
acetate  for  emergency  contraception  when  taken  between  48  and  120  hours  after  unprotected 
intercourse. As no emergency contraceptive is registered for more than 72 hours after UPI, no active-
controlled study was performed.

METHODS 
Study Participants  
Women (aged ≥18 years), with regular menstrual cycles (between 24 and 35 days and intra-individual 
variations less than or equal to 5 days), requesting emergency contraception between 48 and 120 hours 
after  unprotected  intercourse  as  defined  by  lack  of  contraceptive  use,  or  condom  breakage  or  other 
barrier contraceptive method failure, were included. Subjects were excluded from the study in case of 
ongoing pregnancy or breast-feeding or current use of hormonal contraception or IUD.  
Treatments 
Eligible subjects received a single dose of 30 mg ulipristal acetate. Treatment was administered orally 
immediately after all eligibility criteria (including current pregnancy status) had been verified.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate that the pregnancy rate after taking 30 mg ulipristal acetate 
was statistically significantly lower than the estimated expected pregnancy rate in the study population 
in the absence of emergency contraception.  
Secondary objectives were:  
- 
- 
- 
to  demonstrate  that  the  pregnancy  rate  observed  after  taking  30  mg  ulipristal  acetate  was 
statistically  significantly  lower  than  4%    (The  expected  pregnancy  rate  in  the  absence  of 
back-up contraception method was estimated to be 8% according to conception probabilities 
provided  by  Trussell  et  al.  (1998),  and  previous  international  studies  on  emergency 
contraception (von Hertzen et al 2002). A reduction of pregnancy rate by more than half of 
this  to  a  pregnancy  rate  of  4%  was  considered  as  clinically  meaningful  for  an  emergency 
contraception method); 
to analyze the trend in pregnancy rate over time from the time of unprotected intercourse and 
to estimate the contraceptive effectiveness (prevented fraction) of 30 mg ulipristal acetate  
to study safety, tolerability and impact of ulipristal acetate on menstrual cycle length . 
Endpoints 
- 
Primary efficacy parameter: 
The pregnancy rate, calculated as the number of pregnancies after emergency contraception divided by 
the  total  number  of  women  exposed  to  emergency  contraception  for  whom  pregnancy  status  was 
known. 
- 
Secondary efficacy parameter: 
Contraceptive  effectiveness  or  prevented  fraction,  defined  as  the  number  of  pregnancies  observed 
divided by the number of expected pregnancies based on conception probabilities (Trussell et al 1998)  
by cycle day of unprotected intercourse.  
Subjects kept a home diary calendar from the time of treatment until study completion in which they 
were asked to record further intercourse during the cycle, vaginal bleeding, concomitant medications 
and occurrence of adverse events. 
Sample size 
Among  the  1,623  subjects  who  provided  informed  consent  and  enrolled  into  the  study,  1,533  were 
treated  and  included  in  the  ITT  population.  The  ITT  population  (N=1,533)  had  a  mean  age  of  24.4 
years.  
Of those, a total of 1,241 subjects were eligible for the modified Intent-To-Treat population (mITT) 
population on which the primary efficacy analysis was performed. 
24/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
The study was a single-arm study.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was of open design and this is acceptable for the following reasons: 
 a) There is no comparator available with proven efficacy beyond 72 hours. 
 b) Placebo treatment in this indication cannot be considered ethical.  
 c) The  outcome  –  pregnancy  or  no  pregnancy  –  is an  objective  parameter  which  is  not  affected  by 
lack of blinding.  
Statistical methods 
This study was specifically designed to evaluate efficacy in the time frame 48-120 hours, and included 
women  above  18  years  of  age  who  requested  emergency  contraception  between  48-120  hours  after 
UPI.  From  international  published  studies  it  is  known  that  the  number  of  women  requesting 
emergency contraception at 4-5 days after UPI is much lower than on 1-2 days, and exclusion of the 
time  frame  1-2  days  after  UPI  will  lead  to  more  women  in  the  group  4-5  days  after  UPI.  A  total 
sample size was calculated for the whole time frame and not per day, but a separate analysis per day is 
provided. 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the modified ITT population. The mITT population 
included  women  that  received  study  drug  and  had  at  least  one  UPI  reported  at  screening,  and  from 
whom  pregnancy  status  was  known.  Only  the  first  participation  of  the  repeat  enrollers  (66  twice,  9 
three times) was included in this modified population. Women above 35 years of age were excluded 
(demographics  6.7%,  90  subjects),  as  were  3  women  with  a  pregnancy  status  that  was  “not 
compatible”  (three  pregnancies)  with  treatment  failure  (one  subject  was  pregnant  before  treatment 
intake and 2 became pregnant due to intercourse that took place after emergency contraception intake). 
The  observed  pregnancy  rate  was  to  be  concluded  as  statistically  significantly  lower  than  the 
calculated expected pregnancy rate if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) of 
the  observed  pregnancy  rate  was  below  the  calculated  expected  pregnancy  rate.  The  95%  CI  of  the 
observed  pregnancy  rate  was  estimated  using  the  Agresti-Coull  interval  estimation  for  a  binomial 
parameter. The expected pregnancy rate was calculated as follows: 
The cycle day of intercourse (cycle day relative to day of ovulation) was determined by the following 
formula for each subject:   
Cycle  day  of  intercourse  =  (Date  of  unprotected  intercourse  –  Date  of  first  day  of  last 
menstrual period + 1) – (Average length of menstrual cycle – 14). 
The estimated expected pregnancy rate was calculated using a pooled recognizable set of conception 
probabilities by cycle day relative to day of ovulation according to Trussell et al, 1998. 
The  interim  and  final  analyses  were  performed  using  the  Lan  DeMets’  alpha  spending  function 
approach, O’Brien-Flemming spending function and an information fraction of 900/1200 = 0.75. The 
critical value for the interim analysis was set to z0.025 = 2.3397 which corresponds to a probability 
level  of  0.0193  and  for  the  final  analysis  z0.025  =  2.0117  (instead  of  1.96)  which  corresponds  to  a 
nominal  alpha  of  0.02213  and  a  cumulated  exit  probability  of  0.05.  Therefore  95%  confidence 
intervals presented for primary efficacy analyses were adjusted for interim and final analyses. 
The primary efficacy parameter was also analyzed for the mITT2, PP, ITT completer, ITT and repeat 
enrolments. 
The following analyses were performed on all analysis populations: 
The upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the observed pregnancy rate (as calculated 
for the primary efficacy analysis) was compared to a clinical irrelevance threshold (4%).  
Probabilities  of  becoming  pregnant  according  to  the actual  time  from  UPI  were  calculated  from  the 
logistic regression model and were graphically displayed using the spline cubic estimation (Stone & 
Koo, 1985).  
25/49 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy rates were calculated for each of the three 24-hour intervals as well as each of the six 12-
hour intervals between UPI and study medication intake and a logistic regression was used to estimate 
the odds ratio at a given time compared with treatment 24 or 12 hours earlier (Piaggio 1999). 
Prevented fraction was estimated with 95% CI. The 95% CI of the prevented fraction was estimated 
based  on  a  method  proposed  by  Trussell  et  al  (1998).    The  prevented  fraction  was  defined  as  the 
number of prevented pregnancies divided by the number of expected pregnancies. 
Chi-square test (2-sided) was used to compare observed to expected pregnancies per cycle day. 
RESULTS 
Participant flow 
One thousand six hundred twenty three (1,623) subjects were enrolled. Of these, 1,533 were treated 
including 1,507 eligible women and 26 who were treated but not eligible. Of the ITT population 848 
women  were  administered  30  mg  ulipristal  acetate  48  to  72  hours  after  UPI,  476  women  73  to  96 
hours  after  UPI  and  200  women  97  to  120  hours  after  UPI.  Among  the  treated  subjects,  1,362 
completed  all  scheduled  study  visits  as  indicated  in  the  protocol.  There  were  no  subjects  who 
discontinued the study due to an adverse effect. Of the treated subjects, 171 (11%) withdrew from the 
study, of which 102 were lost to follow-up. This percentage is comparable with the 10% anticipated 
for by the applicant. 
Recruitment 
The study started on 27 November 2006, and ended on 31 March 2008. The study was conducted at 40 
study sites in different states in the US, among these were CA, MD, MI, MN, TX, UT and WA. 
Subjects  who  presented for  emergency  contraception  at  a  participating  study  site  48-120  hours  after 
unprotected  intercourse  (UPI)  and  met  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  enrolled  into  the  study 
after they signed the informed consent form. 
Conduct of the study 
26/49 
 
 
 
 
This was an open label single arm study. As the study was focused on a late intake (48h-120h after 
intercourse) and as no hormonal emergency contraception reference treatment exists for use more than 
72 hours after UPI, a non-comparative design was chosen. 
There were three global protocol amendments.  
Baseline data 
The mean age of the 1,533 subjects entered in the ITT population was 24.4 ± 6.1 years. Most women 
fell  into  the  age  categories  18-20  years  (29.1%)  and  21-25  years  (39.9%).  The  demographics  were 
similar  to  the  women  included  in  phase  II  studies  HRA2914-507  and  HRA2914-508.  Besides 
Caucasians (60%), also a minimum proportion of ‘black or African American’ women were included 
(20%). 
The  average  menstrual  cycle  length  reported  at  inclusion  was  29.0  days  (range  24  -  35  days).  The 
majority of subjects (96.0%) had regular periods in the previous year with an average of 4.7 bleeding 
days.  
Male  condom  was  the  primary  contraceptive  method  declared  (71.7%)  in  the  past  three  months  at 
inclusion; 52.5% of subjects had used emergency contraception prior to study entry. 
Of the 1,533 subjects included in the ITT population, prior to inclusion 1,301 (84.9%) of them had one 
unprotected  intercourse,  172  (11.2%),  36  (2.3%) and 13  (0.8%)  of them  had 2, 3  and  4  unprotected 
intercourses, respectively. Two subjects (0.2%) had 5 or greater than 5 unprotected intercourses and 
nine (0.6%) did not have any unprotected intercourse before treatment.  
Subjects  enrolled  reported  the  dates  of  all  acts  of  unprotected  intercourse  at  enrolment,  with  1055 
(69.2%) reporting intercourse 48 to 72 hours, 501 (32.9%) 73 to 96 hours and 199 (13.1%) more than 
96 hours before study medication.

There is no indication that the study population was other than a mix of fertile women, representative 
as a target group for emergency contraception. The number of subjects coming at different times since 
unprotected intercourse appears evenly distributed across the period of interest for the study, possibly 
with fewer patients during the last 24h. 
Numbers analysed 
The  primary  efficacy  evaluation  was  performed  in  1241  women  in  the  the  modified  ITT  population 
(mITT).  The CHMP considered acceptable to exclude repeat enrolments from mITT and they were 
analysed  separately.  It  also  seemed  reasonable  to  exclude  those  106  women  who  did  not  return  for 
follow-up.  The  outcome  of  treatment  in  that  group  is  not  known  and  could  theoretically  include 
several  treatment  failures.  The  most  probable  fate  of  those  subjects  is,  however,  that  they  did  not 
become  pregnant.  It  is  acceptable  to  exclude  subjects  >35  from  mITT,  which  is  likely  to  slightly 
decrease the risk of including subjects with low fertility. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary  efficacy  results  The  observed  pregnancy  rate  (26  pregnancies)  for  the  mITT  population 
(N=1,241)  was  2.10%  (95%  CI;  1.41%,  3.10%).  This  observed  pregnancy  rate  was  statistically 
significantly  lower  than  the  calculated  expected  pregnancy  rate  of  5.53%.  For  the  ITT  Completers 
population  (29  pregnancies)  comparable  results  were  obtained:  pregnancy  rate  of  2.17%  (95%  CI; 
1.49%,  3.15%)  and  calculated  expected  pregnancy  rate  of  5.64%.  Sixteen  of  the  29  pregnancies 
reported  occurred  outside  of  the  defined  mid-cycle  “fertile  period”.  The  results  obtained  from  the 
primary efficacy analysis were confirmed by the secondary efficacy measure ‘supportive analysis’, in 
which the observed pregnancies were compared to the expected pregnancies per cycle day (p<0.001, 
Chi-square test).  
The pregnancy rate of 30 mg ulipristal acetate appears to be higher when indirectly compared to the 
published pregnancy rates within 0-72 hours of UPI of levonorgestrel, although the 95% CIs overlap, 
but is comparable when levonorgestrel is used after 72 hours of UPI. For levonorgestrel, pregnancy 
rates in  published  studies vary  between  0.69%-1.97%  when taken  within  72 hours  of  UPI.  After  72 
hours (subgroup-analyses only), levonorgestrel is reported to have a drop in efficacy, and pregnancy 
rates of 2.44%-2.67% are observed 73-120 hours after UPI. 
Secondary efficacy measures The principal secondary measure was a reduction of the hypothesized 
expected pregnancy rate of 8% with at least 50% (‘clinical irrelevance threshold of 4%’), which was 
based on published international studies on emergency contraception. For both the mITT and the ITT 
Completers populations, the upper bound limit of the 95% CI of the pregnancy rate did not exceed this 
4%-threshold. 
The ‘prevented fractions of pregnancies’ for the mITT population and the ITT completers population 
were  62.35%  (95%  CI;  41.89-75.56)  and  61.33%  (95%  CI;  41.42-74.48),  respectively.  These 
prevented fractions are comparable with prevented fractions that were reported for levonorgestrel in 
the  time  frame  73-120  hours  after  UPI,  60%  for  2  x  0.75  mg  levonorgestrel  and  63%  for  1.5  mg 
levonorgestrel  (also  calculated  by  Trussell  et  al.),  but  lower  than  is  commonly  reported  for 
levonorgestrel within 72 hours after UPI (approximately 80%). 
As another secondary efficacy measure, the ‘trend in pregnancy rates’ was evaluated in three 24-hour 
intervals. Opposed to what would be expected on the basis of data from levonorgestrel, the pregnancy 
rates decreased from 2.46% on day 3, to 1.91% on day 4 and 1.68% on day 5 for the ITT Completers 
population. Accordingly, the pregnancy rates for the mITT population were: 2.30% on day 3, 2.04% 
on day 4 and 1.26% on day 5. 
Ancillary analyses 
No subgroup examinations were planned in the protocol. 
28/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exploratory  analyses  were  performed  of  the  observed  pregnancy  rate  in  the  mITT  population  with 
regard  to  investigator,  age,  time  from  intercourse  to  treatment,  glucocorticoids  use  and  further  UPI 
post treatment intake. 
The  only  factor  which  exhibited  any  effect  on  the  pregnancy  rate  was  further  UPI  post  treatment. 
However, due to the very small number of pregnancies, even one event would dominate the outcome. 
•  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analyses) 
Not applicable. 
•  Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies were performed in special populations. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal phase III study was chosen to specifically provide data on efficacy for the interval of 48-
120 hours after UPI favouring the inclusion of more women in the time frame 4-5 days after UPI. The 
results of this study indicated a significant over-all contraceptive effect. 
Methodology 
In  the  absence  of  a  control  group,  the  observed  pregnancy  rate  was  compared  to  the  estimated 
pregnancy  rate  without  use  of  emergency  contraception,  calculated  by  the  method  of  Trussell  et  al. 
(Contraception 1998; 57: 363-9). It attributes a different probability of pregnancy to each day of the 
cycle.  Subsequently,  the  number  of  expected  pregnancies  from  a  population  can  be  obtained  by 
multiplying the probability assigned to each day by the number of women exposed and summing up 
all the values corresponding to “risk days”. It is noted that 16 of 29 pregnancies observed in the phase 
III  trial  occurred  on  days  of  the  menstrual  cycle  for  which  the  conception  probability  according  to 
Trussell et al. was 0. There are published data indicating that intercourse outside of the supposed mid-
cycle ‘fertile period’ may  result in pregnancy. According to guidelines, during the average woman's 
menstrual cycle there are six days when intercourse can result in pregnancy, which “fertile window” 
comprises the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation itself. The problem is that the day of 
ovulation  is  not  known  for  women  in  clinical  trials  of  ECs,  so  it  has  been  estimated  as  usual  cycle 
length minus 14 days. Only women with regular cycles can be used to estimate the expected number 
of  pregnancies,  and  hence effectiveness,  because  otherwise  the  expected  day  of ovulation  cannot  be 
estimated.  However,  this  estimate  of  the cycle  day  of  ovulation  is  known  to  be quite  imprecise  and 
leads  to  the  paradoxical result  that  many  women  are observed to  become  pregnant from  intercourse 
occurring on cycle days with presumed zero probabilities of pregnancy.6 
According to a prospective cohort study by Wilcox at al. (Br Med J 2001; 322:617)7, the timing of the 
fertile window is highly variable, even among women who regard their menstrual cycles as regular. In 
this study, ovulation occurred as early as the eighth day and as late as the 60th day of the menstrual 
cycle.  More  than  70%  of  women  are  in  their  fertile  window  before  day  10  or  after  day  17  of  their 
menstrual  cycle.  There  are  few  days  of  the  menstrual  cycle  during  which  some  women  are  not 
potentially fertile.

Estimates of conception probabilities by cycle day of intercourse have recently been published8, where 
cycle day is measured in the usual way with day 1 being the first day of bleeding in a cycle. These 
show that the typical woman faces a risk of pregnancy on every day of her cycle except for the first 
two.  It  was  concluded  that  there  are  robust  data  indicating  that  intercourse  outside  of  the  supposed 
mid-cycle ‘fertile period’ according to Trussell (1998) may result in pregnancy. It was noted that this 
occurred also in the comparative phase II study, i.e. 5 pregnancies fell outside the fertile period in the 
levonorgestrel-treated group.

Almost  two  thirds  of  women  (817/1241)  were  enrolled  for  intercourse  that  took  place  outside  the 
presumed  fertile  window:  of  these,  16  became  pregnant.  As  such  high  proportion  of  women  were 
outside the supposed fertile window and were assigned a conception probability equal to zero whereas 
certain  were  in  fact  at  risk  of  becoming  pregnant,  the  CHMP  agreed  with  the  applicant  that  the 
estimated expected pregnancy rate may well be underestimated. However, on the other hand it needs

to be taken into account that new probability scores have lower probability scores on -4 days before 
ovulation up to day 0 (ovulation) than currently applied with conception probability by Trussell 1998.  
Nevertheless, all 1334 women took medication because of unprotected intercourse. Overall, there were 
29  pregnancies  (2.2%)  observed.  The  expected  pregnancy  rate  over  the  whole  period  based  on 
Trussell’s distribution would have been 75 pregnancies (5.6%). So even when bias is introduced, i.e. 
the extraordinary pregnancies (7 ≥ 5 days before ovulation and 9 > 1 day after ovulation), these figures 
i.e.29 pregnancies (2.17%) are still much lower than 75 pregnancies (5.64%). It is therefore concluded 
that adequate efficacy is shown. 
Furthermore,  the  rate  of  women  over-stating  their  risk  of  conception  cannot  be  estimated.  In  the 
“worst case scenario”, in a significant number of cases women might wrongly recollect the dates of 
the menstrual cycle if faced with the uncertainty of not obtaining emergency contraception. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of possible errors in women’s reporting of risk 
(e.g. changes in cycle dates) by moving presumed ovulation dates up to 7 days either way relative to 
self-estimated reporting. Those results showed that the expected pregnancy rate was only marginally 
affected,  confirming  a  significant  difference  between  expected  and  observed  pregnancy  rates. 
Moreover, as the date of ovulation in real life is poorly known, efficacy data were calculated assuming 
that  all  patients  were  completely  evenly  distributed  across  the  whole  menstrual  cycle  (instead  of 
relying  on  their  self-reported  data).  Even  then, the  resulting  expected  pregnancy  rate  was  above  the 
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the observed pregnancy rate, confirming efficacy.  
The  reduction  of  the  hypothesized  expected  pregnancy  rate  of  8%  with  50%  (‘clinical  irrelevance 
threshold  of  4%’)  is  considered  less  relevant,  as  the  calculated  expected  pregnancy  rate  was  5.64% 
instead  of  the  hypothesized  8%.  In  this  case  an  observed  pregnancy  rate  of  4%,  would  only  be  a 
reduction in pregnancies of 29%. However, lower pregnancy rates have also been reported for other 
trials: the first WHO EC trial published in 1998  reported a 7.5% expected pregnancy rate according to 
Wilcox, corresponding to an estimated 6% expected pregnancy rate according to Trussell, and a recent 
review  of  pregnancy  risk  in  a  series  of  EC  trials  reported  an  expected  pregnancy  rate  according  to 
Trussell  of  5.4%.  It  appears,  therefore,  that  the  expected  pregnancy  rate  in  populations  seeking 
emergency contraception may vary from 5.4% to 8%. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  in  the  mITT  population.  This  is  not  considered 
appropriate, as the exclusion of women above 35 years of age is not supported, nor the exclusion of 
the  subjects  with  pregnancies  determined  as  “not  compatible”.  The  conception  probabilities  by 
Trussell et al. used to calculate the expected pregnancy rate were based on studies which also included 
women above 35 years of age. Moreover, exclusion of >35 years was not present in HRA2914-507, 
HRA2814-508  and  in  other  published  studies.  The  ITT  Completers  Population,  which  includes 
women above >35 years and pregnancies considered “not compatible”, is therefore seen as the most 
important population, and the primary focus in this assessment. However, in this case the CHMP did 
not  consider  this  an  issue,  because  the  results  of  the  mITT  population  and  the  ITT  Completers 
population are comparable. 
Results 
As another secondary efficacy measure, a separate analysis was made for days 3, 4 and 5. This is an 
important point, because up till now emergency contraception with levonorgestrel has been restricted 
up to 72 hours. As expected, more women were included on day 3 after UPI (n= 735), than on day 4 (n 
=  420)  and  5  after  UPI  (n=179),  which    makes  the  efficacy  assessment  during  the  period  96-120  h 
difficult. The observed pregnancy rate, the number of expected pregnancies and the prevented fraction 
with accompanying 95% confidence intervals, during the different time intervals (48-72h; 72-96h; 96-
120h) has been calculated.

The  number  of  women  included  in  each  subgroup  analysis  is  low  which  increases  the  degree  of 
uncertainty of the point estimates, as can be observed by the widening of the 95% CI’s. However, the 
results are consistent with the overall analysis for the following reasons:  
The  observed  pregnancy  rates  in  the  3  subgroups  are  within  the  range  of  that  noted  for  the  overall 
pregnancy  rate,  i.e.  noted  for  the  total  time  frame  of  48-120  hours  [2.10  (1.41  –  3.10)],  as  are  the 
prevented fractions (48-120 hours: 62.3%). The 95% confidence intervals are rather broad which is not 
unexpected  as  the  numbers  in  the  subgroups  decreases  drastically.  As  a  result,  the  degree  of 
uncertainty is increased. However, the confidence interval over the observed pregnancy rate does not 
allow a useful interpretation as it is the difference between expected and observed pregnancy rate and 
its uncertainty which is of interest.  
The prevented fraction takes this difference into account and is thus more useful. Several conclusions 
can be drawn: 
•  Although the 95% confidence intervals are wide, the confidence intervals of the prevented fraction 
do not include 0%, indicating that there is pregnancy protection.  
•  Moreover, the point estimate is considered the best estimate, and it is extremely unlikely that, if 
the  study  would  be  repeated,  these  point  estimates  would  diverge  drastically  from  the  currently 
calculated point estimates. 
•  The point estimates for the subgroups are consistent. 
•  The prevented fraction can also be converted in the relative risk of pregnancy between non-users 
versus Ellaone users, which may give more clarity. The risk of pregnancy in non-users is 2.6, 2.4, 
and  4  times  larger,  respectively,  at  day  3,  4,  and  5  as  compared  to  Ellaone  users.  Again, 
confidence  intervals  are  wide  but  do  not  include  1  (1  would  indicate  no  difference)  and  are 
consistent for all three comparisons.  
In conclusion, although the study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy per 24 hour time frame, 
these subgroup analyses can be considered supportive of efficacy across the whole time frame of 48-
120 hours after UPI.  
An overall pregnancy rate of 2.17% for the ITT Completers population in the time frame 48-120 hours 
was considered acceptable, as well as the prevented fraction of 61%.  
As an additional analysis was performed in the ITT completer population (n = 1302 women) with no 
additional use of emergency contraception during treatment cycle (population called “ITT completer 
2”). The efficacy results presented in the following table provide 95% CI for both observed pregnancy 
rate and expected pregnancy rate (Trussell) on and mITT populations.

Table: Observed and expected pregnancy rate on mITT completer 2 and on mITT populations 
These additional analyses indicated that the possible inclusion in the analysis of those women who did 
use emergency contraception more than once during the treatment cycle did not relevantly change the 
observed and expected pregnancy rates. 
The applicant did not investigate the effect of multiple acts of intercourse or contraceptive failures on 
the pregnancy rate. Even more, most of the women had had only one act of unprotected intercourse, 
84.4%  in  the  ITT  Completers  population.  Therefore,  the  claim  “one  or  more  acts  of”  was  removed 
from the indication, as this had not been specifically studied.  
Another issue is the use in adolescents younger than 18 years of age. The applicant has submitted a 
paediatric  investigation  plan  on  24  July  2008  to  the  EMEA  (EMEA-000305-PIP-01)  in  which  they 
propose to perform the following clinical studies: 
•  Single-blind,  multicentre,  randomized,  parallel  group  safety  and  efficacy  study  of  ulipristal 
acetate 30 mg versus levonorgestrel 1.5 mg for emergency contraception within 120 hours of 
unprotected intercourse, in adolescents (and in adults). 
•  Open-label, observational safety study of ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception within 
120 hours of unprotected intercourse, in adolescents (and in adults). 
Finally, a major restriction of the pivotal clinical study was that it did not provide data for the time 
frame of 0-48 hours after UPI. This had been studied in the pivotal phase II studies HRA2914-507 and 
HRA2914-508 that were carried out with the 50 mg unmicronized formulation. A clinical effect was 
shown in both studies with non-inferiority of 50 mg unmicronized ulipristal acetate to levonorgestrel 
twice 0.75 mg within 72 hours after UPI, but the adequacy of pharmacokinetic data provided to bridge 
the 50 mg unmicronized and 30 mg micronized dosages was questioned.  
For  this  reason,  the  Applicant  provided  during  the  course  of  the  procedure  the  interim  analysis  of 
efficacy results obtained in the ongoing comparative Phase III clinical study (HRA2914-513). 
•  Ongoing comparative Phase III clinical study (HRA2914-513) (interim analysis results) 
The protocol of trial HRA2914-513 had not been included in the original dossier by the applicant. The 
results of an interim analysis and the protocol were received during the assessment procedure.  
Study HRA2914-503 concerns a prospective, randomized, single blind, multicenter study to compare 
the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  ulipristal  acetate  with  levonorgestrel  as  emergency 
contraception  within  120  hours  of  unprotected  intercourse.  The  treatments  were  administered  in  a 
single-blind fashion, with the treatment identity known by the study staff but unknown by the subjects 
and the sponsor.

The  primary  objective  was  to  demonstrate  that  the  pregnancy  rate  observed  after  taking  ulipristal 
acetate (30 mg tablet micronized) within 72 hours of UPI is statistically significantly lower than the 
estimated expected pregnancy rate in the absence of emergency contraception. 
There were nine secondary objectives, from which the following objectives are considered the most 
important: 
- To demonstrate that the pregnancy rate observed after taking ulipristal acetate (30 mg tablet 
micronized) within 72 hours of UPI is statistically significantly lower than 4% considered as a 
clinical irrelevance threshold. 
- To demonstrate the non-inferiority of ulipristal acetate 30 mg versus levonorgestrel 1.5 mg as 
EC within 72 hours of UPI. Should non-inferiority be demonstrated, superiority will be tested. 
- To demonstrate the non-inferiority of ulipristal acetate 30 mg versus levonorgestrel 1.5 mg as 
EC  within  120  hours  of  UPI.  Should  non-inferiority  be  demonstrated,  superiority  will  be 
tested. 
Sample size calculations were based on the primary efficacy analysis, and the main secondary analysis 
(inferiority  to  clinical  threshold)  and  the  non-inferiority  of  ulipristal  acetate  30  mg  versus 
levonorgestrel  1.5  mg  as  EC  within  72  hours  of  UPI.  In  order  to  reach  at  least 85%  power  with  an 
equivalence margin of 1.6 in odds ratio, 1022 patients per group were randomized for a total of 2044 
patients. 
Because  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  0-72  h  interval,  study  enrollment  was 
supposed  to  be  stopped  once  827  patients  meeting  criteria  for  the  primary  efficacy  population  per 
group in this time interval had completed the study. 
Interim analysis 
In  the  protocol  it  was  predefined  that  an  interim  analysis  was  to  be  performed  once  1200  patients 
meeting criteria for primary efficacy evaluation had completed the study.  
Three efficacy analyses were performed at the interim analysis: Primary efficacy analysis, inferiority 
to clinical irrelevance threshold and non-inferiority analysis to Levonelle.  
In  the  event  that  the  upper  limit  of  the  confidence  interval  of  the  pregnancy  rate  in  the  mITT 
population  was  below  the  estimated  expected  pregnancy  rate  and  below  the  clinical  irrelevance 
threshold  of  4%,  and  that  ulipristal  acetate  was  non  inferior  to  levonorgestrel,  the  study  would  be 
considered  positive  and  recruitment  will  be  stopped.  Using  Lan  DeMets’  alpha  spending  function 
approach, O’Brien-Flemming spending function and an information fraction of 1200/1654 = 0.72, we 
get a critical value for the interim analysis equals to z0,025 = 2,3876 which corresponds to a probability 
level  of  0,01696  and  for  the  final  analysis  z0,025  =  2,0056  (instead  of  1.96)  which  corresponds  to  a 
nominal alpha of 0,02245 and a cumulated exit probability of 0.05.     
In  practice,  the  confidence  interval  will  be  computed  using  a  Zα/2  equal  to  2,3876  at  the  interim 
analysis and equal to 2,0056 at the final analysis (instead of 1.96). 
The  power  of  the  final  analysis  is  approximately  82.4%  and  the  power  of  the  interim  analysis  is 
approximately 56.5%.  
Since the results satisfied the statistical criteria for efficacy as defined in the protocol and the interim 
analysis SAP, the applicant decided to stop recruitment in the study as of 4 February 2009. 
Results 
As  planned  in  the  protocol,  the  interim  analysis  was  performed  on  data  from  the  first  1200  mITT 
subjects enrolled within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse (UPI). 
According to the statistical analysis plan for the interim analysis, three analyses were performed: 
1)  Primary  efficacy  analysis:  comparison  of  the  upper  limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  observed 
ulipristal acetate pregnancy rate to the expected pregnancy rate (calculated by the method of 
Trussell et al. 1998) in the absence of emergency contraception. 
2)  Inferiority to clinical irrelevance threshold: comparison of the upper limit of the 95% CI of the 
observed ulipristal acetate pregnancy rate to the threshold of 4%. 
3)  Non-inferiority analysis: comparison of the upper bound of the 95% CI of the pregnancy odds 
ratio in the ulipristal acetate group relative to that in the levonorgestrel group versus the non-
inferiority margin of 1.6.

Estimation of the odds ratio is adjusted for expected pregnancy rate through a logistic model. 
Confidence intervals are adjusted for the interim analysis – the used critical value is 2.3786 
instead  of  1.96.  Confidence  intervals  of  non  adjusted  results  are  not  presented  but  are 
narrower. 
The  1200  mITT  subjects  included  in  the  analysis  were  distributed  as  follows  among  the  three  24-h 
intervals between UPI and treatment:  
• 
• 
• 
[0-24h]: 458 (38.2%);  
[24-48h]:452 (37.7%);  
[48-72h]: 290 (24.2%). 
The observed pregnancy rate with ulipristal acetate over the 0-72h time interval was 1.51% [0.62% - 
3.32%], and the results of the three analysis satisfied the statistical criteria for efficacy as defined in 
the protocol and the interim analysis SAP.  
Blinded  results  were  provided  over  the  whole  120h  interval.  Based  on  the  ongoing  database  as  of 
January  27,  2009,  2048  subjects  had  been  enrolled  overall.  Among  them,  214  (10.4%)  presented  in 
[72-120h] time window and 3 subjects were pregnant at follow-up. No calculations were presented on 
pregnancy rates based on these data, because a number of subjects were still undergoing follow-up.  
Because the results of the interim analysis satisfied the statistical criteria for efficacy as defined in the 
protocol,  the  applicant  decided  to  stop  recruitment  in  the  study  as  of  4  February  2009.  Clinical 
investigators,  study  staff  and  other involved  parties had  been  informed  of  this decision,  but  specific 
results  had  not  been  disclosed.  Investigators  were  instructed  to  perform  follow  up  of  all  enrolled 
subjects to completion as per the study protocol, and the Applicant intended to proceed with cleaning 
the full database in a blinded fashion before code break. The full study report of HRA2915-513 will 
be available by the end of July 2009. 
In conclusion, the results from the interim analysis support adequate efficacy for the time interval 0-72 
hours. Furthermore, despite the fact that the interim analysis did not provide efficacy data for the time 
interval 73 – 120 hours for ulipristal acetate, the 4 pregnancies reported among 232 women (from the 
whole  study  population  of  2048  subjects)  who  had  been  randomized  to  ulipristal  acetate  or 
levonorgestrel, suggested a low pregnancy rate also in that time interval.  
Clinical safety 
The safety data presented summarized adverse events for all subjects who were included in the 6 phase 
I studies, 2 phase II studies and 1 phase III study. Also, serious adverse events of an ongoing phase III 
trial were incorporated. Overall, the safety profile reported for ulipristal acetate was comparable to that 
reported for levonorgestrel, registered for emergency contraception up to 72 hours after UPI. The most 
frequently observed adverse events in the phase III trial were headache, nausea and abdominal pain. 
•  Patient exposure 
Overall, 3,560 subjects were evaluated for safety of ulipristal acetate. The number of patients exposed 
in the phase II and III studies was 3,391, from which 1,533 subjects received the dose to-be-marketed. 
In  the  phase  II  studies,  four  multiple  enrolments  occurred.  Seventy-five  women  were  enrolled  on 
multiple occasions in the phase III study (66 twice and 9 three times). Multiple enrollers were defined 
as subjects who were enrolled and treated more than once. 
In the 3 completed safety & efficacy studies performed in the USA (HRA2914-507, HRA2914-508 
and HRA2914-509), 214 subjects received 10 mg unmicronized ulipristal acetate, 399 received 10 mg 
micronized ulipristal acetate, 1533 received 30 mg micronized ulipristal acetate, 1,245 received 50 mg 
unmicronized ulipristal acetate and 840 received 2 x 0.75 mg levonorgestrel. Safety data is considered 
adequate for exposure to 30 mg micronized ulipristal acetate single-dose administration. No long-term 
safety data is required for the 30 mg formulation, as the indication emergency contraception concerns 
only  a  single  dose.  The  subjects  were  in  general  healthy  women  with  a  mean  age  of  24  years.  No 
35/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant  differences  were  observed  between  the  treatment  groups  for  age,  race,  height,  and  body 
weight in the phase II studies. The baseline characteristics of the phase III trial were comparable with 
the characteristics of the subjects included in the phase II trials. The majority of the women were white 
(60.3%),  but  a reasonable percentage  belonged  to  other  racial  groups,  for  instance  Black  or  African 
American (21.5%).  
•  Adverse events  
AEs were generally similar in both treatment groups in the two phase II studies, with 73% of subjects 
who experienced one or more AEs in the 10 mg unmicronized group, 79% in the 10 mg micronized 
group, 77% in the 50 mg unmicronized group and 76% in the levonorgestrel group. The incidence of 
AEs is higher than was previously reported for levonorgestrel 2x0.75 mg 12 hours apart. The higher 
incidence is not a reason for concern, as this could well be a consequence of the three-day diary with a 
yes/no response to a predefined checklist. Ovarian pain was higher in the ulipristal acetate groups (7% 
unmicronized  10  mg,  6%  micronized  10  mg,  3%  unmicronized  50  mg)  compared  to  levonorgestrel 
(1%).  ‘Ovarian  pain’,  though  suggesting  an  etiologic  cause,  however  appeared  to  have  low 
significance  from  a  medical  standpoint.  Further  information  on  the  possible  relationship  of  ovarian 
pain and the presence of ovarian cysts indicated that in the clinical studies ‘ovarian pain’ was mainly 
mild  or  moderate  in  intensity,  not  dose-dependent  and  not  suggestive  of  ovarian  cyst-related  pain. 
Incidence of severe or moderate ovarian pain was reported in only 2 women and treatment was only 
necessary in 3 women. It is therefore concluded that there is insufficient evidence to directly relate this 
symptom to the possible presence of functional cysts. However, the use of this term will nevertheless 
cause confusion regarding its etiology. 
During the phase III trial, 876 (61.4%) subjects experienced at least one AE. The majority (89.1%) of 
the AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. The most common AEs were headache (17.5%), nausea 
(12.2%) and abdominal pain (11.7%). The frequencies are comparable for what has been reported for 
levonorgestrel. The AEs are well reflected in section 4.8 of the proposed SPC. Vomiting was observed 
in 2% of the subjects, therefore what to do in case of vomiting after intake of the 30 mg tablet has been 
included in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
The  post-treatment  cycle  length  was  2.9  days  longer  from  average  length  in  the  phase  III  trial.  A 
shortened menstrual cycle was reported in some women: in study HRA2914-509, 96 (6.1%) women in 
the  ITT  population  reported  onset  of  menses  earlier  than  expected  by  1  week  or  more.  14  women 
(0.9%)  reported  onset  of  menses  earlier  than  expected  by  2  weeks  or  more.  19.2%  had  a  change  in 
cycle length greater than 7 days, and 5.1% greater than 20 days. Seven out of 1,336 subjects had still 
not  experienced  menstrual  bleeding  60  days  after  expected  menses.  From  the  3  subjects  that 
underwent  clinical  investigations,  the  menses  returned  after  approximately  100  days.  In  one  case, 
amenorrhea  might  be  explained  by  polycystic  ovary  syndrome  (PCOS).  One  subject  had  full 
amenorrhea exams performed with unknown diagnosis and menses returned 4 months after expected 
onset of menses. Unfortunately, 3 of the 4 women in whom ongoing amenorrhoea was noted were lost 
to follow-up. However, incidence of amenorrhoea is taken into account in the RMP.  
The delay in menstrual bleeding is mentioned in section 4.4. of the SPC. An increase of 7-20 days in 
the post-treatment cycle is considered acceptable. Although it is expected that subsequent menstrual 
cycles will return to their pretreatment pattern, no information is present in the file.  
A dose-response relationship was observed in the pharmacodynamic studies between ulipristal acetate 
and  the  presence  of  ovarian  cysts.  There  were  three  women  with  cysts  which  did  not  resolve 
spontaneously,  leading  to  one  case  of  surgery  for  a  ruptured  cysts  and  a  90-day  cycle,  and  one 
ovariectomy.  Unfortunately,  no  ultrasound  was  performed  in  the  pivotal  phase  III-trial.  Based  on 
pharmacodynamic studies that evaluated women by ultrasound there is no clear dose-response relation 
with regard to the incidence of cysts, but the number of women evaluated is low and it is therefore 
agreed  with  the  applicant  that  a  dose-response  relation  or  a  causal  relation  with  ulipristal  acetate 
cannot be excluded. It is considered reassuring that the pivotal phase II study and phase III study did 
not report symptomatic ovarian cysts. Nevertheless, occurrence of ovarian cysts is also reported with 
hormonal contraception and other medicinal products that interfere with the pituitary-ovarian axis. It is 
therefore recommended to include occurrence of ovarian cysts in the RMP.

No  case  of  endometrial  hyperplasia  was  noted  in  the  endometrial  biopsies  taken  after  12-weeks 
administration  of  micronized  ulipristal  acetate  up  to  10  mg/day.  However,  after  single-dose 
administration endometrial hyperplasia was noted in 1 out of 55 subjects in the HRA2914-506 study, 
but at follow-up two months after treatment only stromal glandular desynchrony was observed. It is 
considered  very  unlikely  that  a  single-dose  administration  would  be  capable  to  induce  adverse 
endometrial effects. 
Data  regarding  pregnancy  was  very  limited.  Of  the  29  treated  subjects  in  the  Phase  III  trial  who 
became pregnant, 16 elected to have an induced abortion, 6 reported spontaneous abortion, 6 decided 
to carry the pregnancy to term, and 1 was lost to follow-up. At the time of database lock, 5 of the 6 
pregnancies  to  be  carried  to  term  were  still  ongoing;  one  woman  expected  to  deliver  in  December 
status.

•  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in any completed or ongoing studies. 
Nine  serious  adverse  events  occurred  (bacterial  pneumopathy,  abdominal  pain  and  fever,  Grave’s 
disease,  kidney  infection,  pelvic  inflammatory  disease  (PID),  seizure,  pelvic  pain  associated  with 
urinary  tract  infection,  stomach  ulcer,  vomiting  blood-stained  fluid).  All  SAEs  were  considered  not 
related to the study drug, including the one case of PID. 
•  Laboratory findings 
Laboratory  results  do  not  seem  to  alter  significantly  when  pre-  and  post-treatment  values  are 
compared.  The  original  Phase  III  study  design  (HRA2914-509)  did  not  include  any  laboratory 
analyses, but following the results of a US FDA Special Protocol Assessment procedure the protocol 
was amended in order to obtain data on safety laboratory parameters in a sample of subjects with the 
final dosage form of the drug. 
•  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factor: age 
The frequency and profile of AEs were comparable in the ITT population and in the population aged 
35 years or less (mITT population). 
Given  the  population  that  is  expected  to  use  Ellaone  in  daily  practice,  the  absence  of  information 
regarding effects in post pubertal children might represent a safety concern. The safety in post pubertal 
children will be addressed within the Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
Hepatic and renally impaired populations 
The applicant was requested to provide any available information on the efficacy and safety of Ellaone 
in  hepatic  and  renal  impaired  populations  in  the  current  clinical  studies.  The  fact  that  no  inquiries 
regarding  liver  or  renal  impairment  were  received  does  not  directly  implicate  that  no  safety  issue 
exists. However, requesting specific pharmacokinetic studies would lead to unnecessary exposure in 
women with renal and liver impairment. Ulipristal acetate is primarily metabolised in the liver and no 
relevant effect on PK parameters of ulipristal acetate in women with renal impairment is expected. In 
women  with  hepatic  impairment  PK  may  be  affected  but  it  should  be  taken  into  consideration  that 
ulipristal  acetate  is  given  only  as  one  single  tablet  and  it  is  unlikely  that  these  women  will  be 
candidates for this kind of treatment. The current  SPC text under 4.2, mentioning that use of ulipristal 
acetate  is  not  recommended  in  females  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  is  therefore  considered 
sufficient.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific study or analysis of drug interactions was performed. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As  almost  all  studies  were  performed  with  a  single-dose  administration,  consequently  the 
discontinuation due to significant adverse events is extremely low. 
Only  two  subjects  were  withdrawn  due  to  AE:  one  in  study  HRA2914-501  (hyperthyroidism 
secondary to thyroiditis) and one in study HRA2914-510 (abdominal pain and fever). 
•  Post marketing experience 
Ulipristal acetate is not yet marketed in any dose in any country. Therefore, no post-marketing data is 
available. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
39/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ulipristal acetate single-dose in general appears to be well tolerated, and has an AE profile comparable 
with levonorgestrel. However, several concerns remain: 
-  The pregnancy follow-up so far is very limited and no conclusions can be drawn with regard to 
safety,  should  the  woman  take  ulipristal  acetate  in  very  early  pregnancy.  Pregnancy  follow-up 
will  be  an  important  part  of  the  risk  management  plan.  In  the  section  4.2  it  is  stated  that 
pregnancy should be excluded, if suspected, before Ellaone is administered. 
-  The effect of a single-dose administration on the development of ovarian cysts and amenorrhea. 
Current  safety  data  suggest  reversible  occurrence  of  ovarian  cysts  and  delay  in  return  of 
menstrual bleeding.  Spontaneous reports of these adverse events need to be followed up closely 
in the PSURs, see also RMP. 
- 
In  theory,  a  woman  may  request  emergency  contraception  repeatedly,  either  in  the  same 
menstrual cycle or in subsequent cycles. In the SPC statements have been added in section 4.4 to 
address this issue.  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system has deficiencies that should be addressed as 
part of the follow up measures.  
The applicant committed that the deficiencies will be rectified prior to placing the medicinal product 
on the market. The procedures will be updated by June 2009.

Pharmacovigilance Plan 
Liver  effects  and  effect  on  pregnancy  maintenance  will  be  addressed by  routine  pharmacovigilance, 
use of specific report form for spontaneous report, and special attention in PSUR. Liver effects will be 
labelled in section 4.4 of the SPC.  
Inadvertent  exposure  during  pregnancy:  To  address  the  inadvertent  use  in  very  early  undetected 
pregnancy and pregnancy occurring despite correct use due to lack of efficacy, the applicant proposed 
the following measures in the RMP: 
· Routine pharmacovigilance and post marketing data collection on pregnancy outcome in case of 
failure of Ellaone treatment 
· A peri-postnatal study in rat (already being conducted) 
· Contraindication for use in pregnancy   
· Biochemical  pregnancy  test  only  in  cases  where  a  pregnancy  cannot  be  excluded  (patient 
history, menstrual data, symptoms or signs) 
· A web-based pregnancy registry for patients and prescribers, to collect spontaneous reporting of 
exposed pregnancies and their outcome 
· Targeting 1000 major prescribers in multiple EU countries to encourage them to enter data over 
approximately  a  1-year  period,  to  provide  information  on  about  1000  pregnancies  resulting 
from Ellaone failure 
· An observational post-marketing multicenter study within a paediatric investigational plan (PIP) 
is  being  planned,  and  the  applicant  proposes  to  lengthen  the  duration  of  follow-up  to  collect 
more specific data about failures and pregnancy outcome. 
Educational material on the registry will be agreed with the CHMP and provided to the treating 
physicians. 
Effects  in  post  pubertal  children  will  be  addressed  by  an  observational  study  within  the  Paediatric 
Investigation Plan. For effects on pregnancy in case of treatment failure, a specific pregnancy form for 
spontaneous reports will be used. The effects in lactating women are addressed by SPC labelling and 
the  excretion  in  milk  in  rats  will  be  studied.  A  pharmacokinetic  study  in  lactating  women  will  be 
performed  if  the  rat  study  indicates  excretion  in  milk.  Cysts  will  be  followed  by  routine 
pharmacovigilance, special attention will be paid to ovarian cysts in PSURs and ruptured ovarian cysts 
will  be  mentioned  in  section  4.8  of  the  SPC.  Concerning  amenorrhoea,  besides  routine 
pharmacovigilance, special attention will be paid in PSURs and amenorrhea lasting for more than 60 
days will be mentioned in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Off-label  use  as  an  abortifacient:  The  applicant  has  discussed  the  following  options  to  monitor 
intended off-label use of Ellaone: 
1.  Self-reporting of prescribers,  
2.  Retrospective  survey  in  Ob/gyn  departments  among  women  who  are  hospitalized  for 
incomplete “spontaneous” abortions or miscarriage  
3.  Use of prescription registries to identify off-label prescriptions. 
It  is  acknowledged  that  all  these  approaches  suffer  from  similar,  inevitable  limitations  (prescribers 
may not report information about off-label prescriptions). However, the applicant has responded with 
willingness  to  undertake  the  best  efforts  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  such  practice.  In  particular,  the 
applicant will attempt to collect data from existing prescription registries on frequency and reasons for 
Ellaone  prescriptions  in  individual  cases,  which  was  endorsed  by  CHMP.  However,  in  order  to  be 
45/49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
meaningful, such measures will have to be implemented only when Ellaone use has reached a certain 
level of prescription, i.e. not before 1 to 2 years of marketing. The applicant committed to conducting 
a study using information from prescription registries in countries where it is considered feasible. This 
will be done after 1-2 years of marketing, depending on the level of Ellaone use. A protocol for such a 
study should be proposed by the applicant. This issue was resolved by the agreed follow up measures. 
Risk Minimization Plan 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application,  is  of  the  opinion  that  no 
additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
2.6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  Quality  of  this  product  was  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the products have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are 
a  number  of  unresolved  minor  quality  issues  but  these  do  not  have  a  negative  impact  on  the 
benefit/risk ratio.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
In  vivo  pharmacology  results  showed  that  ulipristal  acetate  has  antiprogestinic  activity  shown  as 
inhibition  of  progesterone  induced  endometrial  glandular  proliferation.  An  anti-estrogen  effect  of 
ulipristal acetate is highly unlikely. 
Ulipristal acetate was shown to be effective and more potent than mifepristone in inhibiting ovulation 
and  preventing  pregnancy  in  rats.  When  given  to  guinea  pigs  and  macaques  at  later  stages  of 
pregnancy, ulipristal acetate terminated gestation in some animals.  
It was not possible to evaluate the teratogenic potential of ulipristal acetate since the doses were low in 
order  to  maintain  gestation  of  the  animals.  The  overall  conclusion  on  teratogenic/embryolethal 
potential of ulipristal acetate is that nonclinical data overall are uncertain which is reflected in the SPC 
sections  4.6  and  5.3.  Moreover,  the  SPC  states  that  Ellaone  should  only  be  prescribed  after  a 
pregnancy test has been performed in case pregnancy is suspected. 
Efficacy 
Key efficacy findings 
• 
• 
• 
In  the  controlled  phase  II  study,  non-inferiority  of  50  mg  unmicronized  ulipristal  acetate  to 
levonorgestrel  twice  0.75  mg  within  72  hours  after  unprotected  intercourse  (UPI)  has  been 
adequately shown.  
In the interim analysis of the ongoing phase III study, based on 1200 women, non-inferiority of 30 
mg  micronized  ulipristal  acetate  to  levonorgestrel  twice  0.75  mg  within  72  hours  after 
unprotected intercourse has been adequately shown. 
In the uncontrolled phase III study that used 30 mg micronized ulipristal acetate, performed in 
women requiring emergency contraception from 48-120 hours after UPI, the primary endpoint of 
‘pregnancy rate’ was 2.17% for the ITT Completers population. The primary efficacy analysis was 
performed by the applicant in a modified ITT population, but the results of the mITT population 
and  the  ITT  Completers  population  were  comparable.  The  observed  percentage  of  2.17%  was 
significantly  lower  than  the  calculated  expected  pregnancy  rate  of  5.64%  in  case  no  emergency 
contraception (EC) would have been used. The method used to predict the risk of pregnancy when

no  EC  is  administered  is  acceptable  and  widely  used  in  studies  that  evaluated  efficacy  of 
levonorgestrel  in  this  indication.  When  applying  the  conception  probabilities  by  Trussell  from 
1998,  almost  two  thirds  of  women  (817/1241)  were  enrolled  after  intercourse  that  took  place 
outside the presumed fertile window and of those 16 became pregnant. Thus, it might appear that 
the estimated expected pregnancy rate (risk of pregnancy) is underestimated. However, published 
new  probability  scores  have  lower  probability  scores  on  -4  days  before  ovulation  up  to  day  0 
(ovulation) than currently applied with conception probability estimations by Trussell 1998.  
Nevertheless, all 1334 women took medication because of unprotected intercourse. Overall, there 
were 29 pregnancies (2.2%) observed. Based on Trussell’s risk estimations, over the whole period, 
there would have been 75 expected pregnancies (5.6%). So even when bias is introduced, i.e. the 
extraordinary pregnancies (7 ≥ 5 days before ovulation and 9 > 1 day after ovulation), those 29 
observed pregnancies (2.17%) are still much fewer than the 75 expected pregnancies (5.64%).  
The  observation  that  the  hypothesized  expected  pregnancy  rate  was  higher  than  the  actual 
calculated expected pregnancy rate was noted in several other EC studies and therefore acceptable. 
The  observed  pregnancy  rate  and  the  clinically  most  relevant  secondary  endpoint  ‘prevented 
fraction  of  pregnancies’  (62%)  were  comparable  with  published  pregnancy  rates  noted  for 
levonorgestrel  taken  in  the  time  frame  73-120  hours.  The  overall  magnitude  of  the  prevented 
fraction of 62% from day 3-5 after UPI is considered clinically meaningful. 
Strength of evidence 
•  Efficacy 0-72 hours 
Interim analysis: 
-  The  results  of  the  interim  analysis  of  study  HRA2914-513  showed  non-inferiority  of 
micronised ulipristal acetate 30 mg (product to be marketed) versus levonorgestrel in the 0-72 
h time window. The observed pregnancy rate was numerically lower than the pregnancy rate 
of levonorgestrel (1.5 % vs. 2.81%) corresponding with a prevented fraction of 73% vs. the 
expected pregnancy rate. 
This interim-analysis was predefined in the protocol, with the condition that if the outcome of 
this interim analysis did satisfy the statistical criteria for efficacy as defined in the protocol, 
the  applicant  would  stop  recruitment  in  the  study.  This  took  place  as  of  4  February  2009. 
Therefore, the outcome of this interim analysis is not expected to alter the final outcome of the 
study, covering a total of 2048 subjects. 
-  Also, these interim data confirmed the initially submitted results of the phase II study showing 
non-inferiority  between  50  mg  of  the  unmicronised  form  of  ulipristal  acetate  (initial 
formulation)  and  levonorgestrel  for  the  same  time  frame  of  0-72  hours.  The  provided 
additional pharmacokinetic data on dose-proportionality permit extrapolation of these results 
with the 50 mg unmicronised from to the final formulation of micronised ulipristal acetate 30 
mg. 
Therefore, it was concluded that the efficacy of ulipristal acetate as an emergency contraceptive 
between 0 and 72 hour after UPI had been demonstrated. 
•  Efficacy 72-120 hours: 
-  The currently submitted study HRA2914-513 had included 214 subjects in this time window 
of  72-120  hours  of  whom  only  3  were  pregnant  at  follow-up.  As  this  was  not  part  of  the 
interim analysis, no separate analysis was made between both treatment groups but based on 
these 3 pregnancies overall observed pregnancy rate will be low.  
-  These data are in line with the results obtained for the time frame of 72-120 hours on the basis 
of  the  uncontrolled  study  HRA2914-501that  reported  an  overall  observed  pregnancy  rate  of 
2.1% (expected pregnancy rate of 5.5%) with separate analyses for the following time frames: 
Time between intercourse  
and treatment (h) 
48 – 72 
73 – 96 
97 – 120 
Pregnancy rate (%) 
(n) 
2.3 (16 /693) 
2.0 (8 / 390) 
1.3 (2 / 158) 
47/49 
 
 
 
 
-  Although  in  the  currently  submitted  study  HRA2914-513  comparison  between  the  observed 
pregnancy rates after 72-120 h is not yet possible awaiting the final analysis, these data show 
small differences compared to the pregnancy rates of 1.5% in the controlled trials in the time 
frame of 0 – 72 hours and are certainly lower than the expected pregnancy rates. Therefore, 
total amount of data in support of efficacy for days 72-120 since UPI is considered sufficient 
to accept ulipristal acetate for the whole time frame of 0-120 hours.  
Safety 
Regarding  safety  of  Elleaone,  adverse  events  were  in  general  similar  to  those  reported  for 
levonorgestrel.  The  presence  of  ovarian  cysts,  the  occurrence  of  amenorrhoea  and  the  incidence  of 
abdominal/ovarian  pain  were  considered  in  line  with  the  adverse  event  pattern  noted  for  other  sex 
hormones,  including  levonorgestrel.  Nevertheless,  these  adverse  events  will  be  followed  within  the 
context of the RMP. 
Although  there  are  only  few  risks  associated  with  correct  use  of  the  product,  the  very  limited 
information on potential effects of treatment on a pregnancy, that may either be already existing and 
undetected or a result of treatment failure, needs to be further addressed within the RMP. This risk is 
however  minimised  as  it  is  currently  recommended  that  pregnancy  should  be  excluded  before 
ulipristal acetate is used and its use is contra-indicated in pregnancy. 
In addition, the serious concern regarding the possibility of off-label use as an abortifacient (i.e. use of 
ulipristal acetate to medically terminate an already existing pregnancy) is considered adequately dealt 
with.  The  Risk  Management  Plan  was  adapted  to  include  a  plan  on  how  off-label  use  will  be 
monitored and prevented. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
•  User consultation 
The applicant has submitted the results of the user testing, which was conducted in English. 
The  type  of  testing  used  for  the  readability  testing  of  this  packaging  leaflet  was  an  evaluation  and 
problem-seeking test. The test was developed to ensure potential users of Ellaone 30mg Tablet could 
find, understand, and act on information given in the leaflet. A questionnaire was designed, consisting 
of  15  questions  on  the  text  and  4  questions  that  provide  a  positive  or  negative  feedback  from  the 
participants  for  the  user  friendliness  of  the  leaflet.  The  questions  covered  the  following  areas 
sufficiently: traceability, comprehensibility and applicability. 
According  to  the  test  report,  each  and  every  question  was  answered  correctly  by  100%  of  the 
participants, so therefore, no revisions of the package leaflet were proposed with respect to readability 
issues. It was remarked that no italics should be used in the package leaflet, except for the Latin name 
“Hypericum perforatum”. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
Efficacy  has  been  convincingly  demonstrated  across  the  whole  120h  interval.  Due  to  the  provided 
additional information on dose-proportionality of the unmicronized ulipristal acetate bridging of the 50 
mg unmicronized formulation with the 30 mg micronized formulation it is possible, therefore, to take 
into account both clinical phase II studies to assess efficacy for the time frame 0-48 hours. It was also 
concluded that the efficacy of ulipristal acetate as an emergency contraceptive between 0 and 72 hour 
after UPI has been further substantiated by the submitted interim results of the ongoing study. 
The applicant did not investigate the effect of multiple acts of intercourse or contraceptive failure on 
the pregnancy rate. Therefore, the claim “one or more acts” was removed from the indication, as this 
had not been specifically studied.

Regarding safety, adverse events are in general similar as reported for levonorgestrel.  
Ovarian  cysts,  amenorrhoea,  the  incidence  of  abdominal/ovarian  pain,  inadverted  use  during 
pregnancy and the possibility of off-label use as an abortifacient will be followed within the context of 
the RMP. 
The benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
•  pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were 
needed to investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
•  no  additional  risk  minimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the 
product information. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ellaone in the indication of emergency contraception within 
120 hours  (5 days)  of  unprotected  sexual  intercourse  or  contraceptive  failure  was  favourable  and 
therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

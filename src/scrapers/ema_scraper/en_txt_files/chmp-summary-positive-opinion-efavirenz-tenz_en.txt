On 20 October 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Efavirenz 
Teva 600 mg film-coated tablets indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 years of age and older. 
The applicant for this medicinal product is Teva Pharma B.V. They may request a re-examination of 
any CHMP opinion, provided they notify the European Medicines Agency in writing of their intention 
within 15 days of receipt of the opinion. 
The active substance of Efavirenz Teva is efavirenz, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(ATC Code: J05A G03). Efavirenz is a non-competitive inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and 
does not significantly inhibit HIV-2 RT or cellular DNA polymerases (α, β, γ or δ). 
Efavirenz Teva is a generic of Sustiva, which has been authorised in the EU since 28 May 1999. Studies 
have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Efavirenz Teva, and its bioequivalence with the reference 
product Sustiva. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here.  
A pharmacovigilance plan for Efavirenz Teva will be implemented as part of the marketing 
authorisation.  
The approved is indicated in antiviral combination treatment of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 
1) infected adults, adolescents and children 3 years of age and older. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR), and 
will be available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

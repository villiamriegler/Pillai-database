2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancers. Each year approximately 
130,000 people are diagnosed with melanoma worldwide. Despite improving surveillance and 
treatment techniques it is estimated that annually 30,000 people die because of the disease. Death 
rate in Europe is estimated to be 3.9 persons per 100.000. According to the program for 
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) of the National Cancer Institute between 2001 
and 2007, 8% of patients were first diagnosed with stage III (regional metastasis) melanoma and 
4% of patients with stage IV (distant metastasis) disease.  
The vast majority of melanoma patients with early stage localized disease are cured with (repeated) 
surgery alone. However those with unresectable or metastatic melanoma have a poor prognosis. 
Dacarbazine has been used since the seventies in Europe as first line treatment of metastatic 
melanoma, despite the low response rate (below 20%), the short duration of response, and the 
absence of any survival advantage1.  
In 2011 the treatment options for metastatic melanoma expanded with the introduction of  the anti 
CTLA4 directed ipilimumab (Yervoy) and the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (Zelboraf);  dabrafenib 
(Tafinlar) was subsequently approved.  
1 Chapman PB, Hauschild A, Robert C, et al. Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E 
mutation. N Engl J Med. 2011;364:2507-16. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 11/132 
 
  
  
                                                
Ipilimumab based on the results of a phase III study performed in previously treated melanoma 
patients was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) 
compared with the gp100 vaccine (10.1 months versus 6.4 months; HR: 0.66; p= 0.003). 
Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), as first line treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutations based on the results of the pivotal phase III 
study (BRIM3) was associated with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free 
survival (PFS) (HR 0.38, 95%CI: 0.32-0.46, p<0.0001, median PFS 6.9 vs 1.6 months, 
respectively) and in OS (HR 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, p<0.0001, median OS 13.6 vs 9.7 months, 
respectively), compared with DTIC.  
Specific mutations of the BRAF-oncogene (especially V600E, and less frequently V600K, V600D, 
V600R) are identified in approximately 40-50% of cutaneous melanomas (Colombino et al., 2012).  
Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) based on the results of the pivotal phase III BREAK study was associated with 
a statistically significant improvement in PFS (HR 0.30, 95%CI: 0.18-0.53, p<0.0001, median PFS 
5.1 vs 2.7 months, respectively) and in the updated analysis with a trend in OS (HR=0.76, 95% CI: 
0.48-1.21, median OS 18.2 vs. 15.6 months, respectively), compared with DTIC.  
Despite the recent innovations the prognosis of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
remains poor and patients with melanoma stage IIIc or IV disease still face median overall survival 
of approximately one year. There is clearly an unmet medical need for this population. 
About the product 
- Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors.  
- ATC code: L01XE25 trametinib (assigned but not formally approved by the WHO International 
Working Group for Drug Statistics Methodology). 
Trametinib (GSK1120212) is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated 
extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. MEK1 and MEK2 are proteins in the 
central signal transduction pathway and are critical for cell proliferation and survival. Trametinib 
has been developed specifically to address known oncogenic mutations in upstream MAPK pathway 
proteins BRAF and Ras, which signal through MEK1 and MEK2. The pharmaceutical form and 
strength are 0.5 mg, 1 mg or 2 mg film-coated tablets. 
The recommended dose of trametinibis 2 mg given orally once daily (QD).  
Development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 12/132 
 
  
  
Scientific advice from the CHMP was sought for both the use of trametinib as monotherapy and in 
combination with dabrafenib, for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF 
V600 mutations. Advice was provided by the Scientific Advice Working Party (SAWP) of the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in 2010 
(EMA/CHMP/SWAP/620177/2010). A co-primary endpoint of OS and PFS for the pivotal study to be 
conducted with trametinib was proposed by the Applicant, but the CHMP considered that PFS as 
primary endpoint would have been sufficiently informative to enable a proper benefit-risk 
assessment, in view of the potential confounding effect of next line therapies and the possible 
necessity to allow cross-over in order to make the study feasible from an ethics committees and 
patient/investigator’s perspective.  
For the development of the combination treatment of trametinib with dabrafenib a SA was 
requested in February 2011 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/261249/2011). OS as primary endpoint was 
considered acceptable, however a concern was raised regarding the potential confounding effect of 
ipilimumab after progression. Testing PFS followed by OS assessment was suggested as an 
alternative strategy. In the advice it was also suggested to consider planning for a protocol-defined 
comparison of the BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combination vs. sequential administration of 
MEKi-BRAF-i, comparing PFS-1- on the combination regimen with PFS-2- on a sequential regimen.  
Paediatric Investigation Plan 
A Paediatric investigation plan for treatment of melanoma and of solid malignant tumours other 
than melanoma had been agreed. For melanoma, a deferral was granted for studies in patients from 
12 to less than 18 years of age, and studies in patients from birth to less than 12 years were waived. 
For solid malignant tumours other than melanoma, a deferral was granted for studies in patients 
from 28 days to less than 18 years of age, and studies in patients from birth to less than 28 days of 
age were waived. The paediatric investigation plan should be completed by October 2019. 
General comments on compliance with GCP  
All clinical studies were conducted with the approval of Ethics Committees or Institutional Review 
Boards.  Informed consent was obtained for all subjects, and the studies were performed in 
accordance with the version of the Declaration of Helsinki that applied at the time the studies were 
conducted. 
Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
Legal basis 
The application for marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for Mekinist 
(trametinib) film-coated tablets was submitted according to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The application is a complete and independent application, for a new active substance. 
The Applicant requested an accelerated assessment before submission of the application which was 
agreed by the CHMP. However the timetable was reverted to a normal timeframe at the time of 
adoption of the day 120 list of questions. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 13/132 
 
  
  
The Applicant requested with the Day 121 responses consideration of a conditional marketing 
authorisation approval. The results of the ongoing phase III confirmatory trial exploring activity of 
dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in the proposed target population are expected in late 
2013, and could be assessed within the timeframe of this procedure, the request for conditional 
marketing authorisation was therefore not endorsed by the CHMP. 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indications:  
Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
Trametinib monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated 
clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:  
Trametinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Trametinib has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients 
who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1).

dropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-1(2H)-yl}phenyl)acetamide with (methylsulfinyl)methane and has the 
following structure: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 14/132 
 
 
  
  
Trametinib  dimethyl  sulfoxide  is  a  1:1  stoichiometric  DMSO  solvate,  where  DMSO  is  fully 
incorporated into the crystal lattice. In solid state one form has been identified (form 1), and it has 
been  consistently  produced  by  the  synthetic  process  used  in  development  and  is  the  proposed 
commercial solid state form. The active substance is a white to almost white solid, very slightly 
soluble in ethanol (non-solvated parent) and acetonitrile and slightly soluble in DMSO (solvated) 
and isopropyl acetate. In the different pH the substance is very slightly soluble (up to 24 hours). 
Chiral centers are not present in this active substance. It was  noted that micronised trametinib 
dimethyl sulfoxide form 1 adsorbs approximately 0.3% w/w water between 0% and 90% relative 
humidity at 25 °C. 
Confirmation of the chemical structure of trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is provided by single crystal 
X-ray crystallography and by spectroscopic analysis (1H NMR and 13C NMR, MS and IR,) 
Manufacture 
Trametinib  dimethyl  sulphoxide  is  manufactured  in  a  seven  step  process  and  purified  by 
crystallisation. The product is micronized in the final part of the process. The process is described in 
sufficient detail concerning raw materials used, process conditions and controls. The designation of 
the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been justified with respect to 
their impurity profiles, their potential for a carry-over into the final active substance, their structural 
complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final intermediate and the active substance, 
respectively.  
The active substance has been developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, in line with 
ICH Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11 and other regulatory guidance. However, no Design Space was proposed.

The critical process parameters (CPP) and their ranges have been clearly highlighted in line with the 
development data.  Amounts to be used for the different materials are indicated in ranges . Details 
on the mixture time, temperatures, etc. are provided in relation to the critical parts of the process 
(CPPs). 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU 
guideline  on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential  and  actual  impurities  were  well 
discussed  with  regards  to  their  origin  and  characterisation.  The  discussion  on  the  genotoxic 
impurities is sufficiently detailed and it is considered acceptable.  Adequate in-process controls are 
applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for  intermediate  products, 
starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specifications have been established in-house. The proposed specifications 
are acceptable in view of the route of synthesis and the various European guidelines. 
The active substance specification includes tests for  appearance (visual), identity (IR), solid state 
(XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), particle size 
(laser diffraction). 
 The discussion on the genotoxic impurities is considered as sufficient. The analytical methods are 
adequately described and validated. 
Batch analysis data are given for three production scale batches and 13 batches used for the safety 
and clinical studies. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data are presented for three commercial scale batches of trametinib. The batches were 
stored in double low-density PE bag inside with desiccant in between and place in a aluminium foil 
laminated pouch. Comparative batch analysis data demonstrate that batches manufactured via the 
commercial process and micronized at the proposed commercial site are chemically and physically 
comparable to the trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide used in the Phase 3 clinical and primary stability 
studies. 
The results of long-term and accelerated stability studies demonstrate the chemical and physical 
stability of trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide when stored for up to 36 months at 30°C/65%RH, or for up 
to 6 months at 40°C/75%RH. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. No significant changes were observed in the parameters tested (description, 
trametinib  dimethyl  sulfoxide  content,  drug-related  impurities  content,  DMSO  content,  water 
content, solid state form or particle size). All results complied with specification.  
In addition, data were presented following short-term storage of the active substance under stress 
conditions. All three primary stability batches were stored at 50°C/ambient humidity for 3 months. 
No  significant  changes  were  observed  in  any  of  the  parameters,  all  results  complied  with  the 
specification.

Forced degradation studies of trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide have also been performed. In the solid 
state include 80 °C for 14 days, 80 °C/75% RH for 14 days and ICHQ1B option 1. Solution phase 
studies  include  acid  (0.1  M  HCl)  60  °C,  4h;  base  0.1  M  NaOH  25  °C,  1  h  and  oxidation  by  air 
headspace  with  N-Methyl  pyrrolidone.  The  acid  and  base  conditions  required  the  addition  of 
acetonitrile  to  enhance  the  solubility  of  trametinib  dimethyl  sulfoxide.    GSK1790627A  and 
GSK1732244A  were  identified  as  the  major  degradation  products  under  acidic  and  oxidative 
conditions,  respectively.  These  impurities  are  also  synthetic  impurities  controlled  by  the  active 
substance  specification.  Trametinib  was  chemically  stable  in  the  solid  state  under  all  stressing 
conditions used in the forced degradation study. No evidence of significant levels of degradation 
products was observed. 
One primary stability batch was exposed to light, within the proposed package, in accordance with 
ICH  Q1B.  Only  two  degradation  products  were  formed  after  exposure  to  light,  with  the  total  of 
degradation  products  detected  being  less  than  0.5%  area.  None  of  the  degradation  products 
reported increased above the identification threshold (>0.10%) specified in ICH Q3A. The active 
substance is not sensitive to light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The product has been developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, in line with ICH Q8, Q9, 
Q10, Q11 and other regulatory guidance. It was noted that no Design Space has been proposed by 
the Applicant.  
The  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  for  trametinib  tablets  was  to  provide  an  immediate 
release oral dosage form with adequate stability and flexible dosing using a wide range of dosage 
strengths from 0.125 mg to 20 mg as trametinib. The range of dosage strengths was later narrowed 
to 0.5 mg to 2 mg based on the maximum tolerated dose of 3 mg/day. Special consideration was 
given to the size of the tablets in order to facilitate swallowing. 
Design selection of the drug product formulation and manufacturing process reflects the QTPP, the 
characteristics  of  the  input  materials  (active  substance  and  excipients),  prior  knowledge,  and 
product specific understanding based on development history. Design selection included the dosage 
form,  strengths,  appearance  of  the  tablets,  particle  size  distribution  of  the  active  substance 
substance,  and  the  choice  of  a  manufacturing  process  and  packaging  minimising  exposure  to 
humidity  in  order  to  limit  desolvation  (loss  of  DMSO).  A  dry  blending  process  and  coating  with 
relatively high evaporation rate conditions were chosen. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 17/132 
 
  
  
Excipients were selected based on their compatibility with the active substance, manufacturability, 
and impact on performance of the finished product. Due to the intended small tablet size for all 
strength, a common blend approach was not possible. With the exception of the coating of the 0.5 
mg  strength,  the  formulation  of  the  tablets  remained  unchanged  throughout  development.  The 
coating of the 0.5 mg strength was changed from opadry white to opadry yellow in order to improve 
photostability. 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) have been identified, and 
a control strategy has been developed to ensure product quality.  
The  finished  product    CQAs  are  description,  identification,  trametinib  content,  DMSO  content, 
drug-related impurities content, uniformity of dosage units, and dissolution. In addition, the coated 
tablets  are  tested  for  water  content  at  release.  The  parameters  and  attributes  contributing  to 
finished product CQA variability have been established and controls have been defined to ensure 
that the performance criteria are consistently and reliably met. 
Risk  assessments,  using  structured  methodologies  such  as  Failure  Mode  and  Effects  Analysis 
(FMEA), in accordance with ICH Q9, were used to establish those process parameters and attributes 
that are likely to have the greatest impact on product quality. 
Control strategies were developed for the three stages of the manufacturing process. 
Following the start of commercial manufacture, ongoing monitoring, trending and review will be 
conducted  to  provide  confidence  that  the  control  strategy  will  ensure  product  quality.  Risk 
management, together with any continuous improvement opportunities, will be applied throughout 
the product lifecycle to maintain the control strategy to meet product quality requirements. 
Except for the commercially available coating materials, all excipients are of pharmacopoeial grade. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  Acceptable  in-house 
specifications were provided for the commercially available coating materials. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Trametinib tablets, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg are packed with silica gel desiccant into opaque, white high 
density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  bottles,  and  closed  with  polypropylene  screw  closures,  with  a 
polyethylene-faced  foil  induction  heat-seal  liner.  The  HDPE  is  pigmented  white  with  titanium 
dioxide.  The  container  closure  system  was  chosen  because  low  tablet  moisture  content  was 
desirable due to the loss of DMSO solvent in the presence of moisture. The presence of silica gel is 
essential to maintain a low moisture atmosphere during the entire shelf life. The primary packaging 
is described as stated in the SmPC and  complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of 
the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  includes  blending,  compression,  film-coating  and  packaging.  A  flow 
diagram  and  a  description  of  the  manufacturing  process  were  provided  identifying  all  critical 
process parameters (CPPs), critical quality attributes (CQAs), as well as attributes which serve as 
in-process controls. The finished product is controlled according to an in-house specification. 
All batches manufactured using the process described have produced finished product of acceptable 
quality and performance showing that this product can be manufactured reproducibly according to 
the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for the control of this oral preparation. 
Due to the low drug load (<2%), the finished product is regarded as non-standard dosage form. The 
Applicant applies a three-stage lifecycle approach for process validation. During the second stage, 
the manufacturing process was successfully evaluated at the commercial site with three commercial 
scale batches of each strength supported by two clinical batches of the 0.5 mg and 2 mg strengths.  
The description of the manufacturing process and the proposed in process controls are consistent 
with the manufacturing process development data and the proposed control strategy. PARs were 
indicated for CPP and non-CPP. 
For critical and non-critical process parameters/attributes ranges, future changes to the defined 
PARs  will  be  managed  under  the  site’s  Pharmaceutical  Quality  System  with  regulatory  action  in 
conformance with post-approval regulations and guidance. 
The proposed batch size is acceptable in view of the provided process evaluation data which were 
obtained at this scale. 
Product specification 
The control of finished product quality is done via in-house specifications. The product specification 
includes tests for description (visual), identification of trametinib (HPLC-UV), trametinib content 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), drug-related impurities (HPLC), DMSO content (HPLC), 
water content (KF), dissolution (HPLC), and microbial enumeration tests (Ph Eur). The release and 
shelf life specifications differ with regard to DMSO content.  
The  analytical  methods  were  adequately  described  and  validated.  Batch  analytical  data  were 
presented  for  three  commercial  image  batches  of  each  strength  produced  by  the  proposed 
commercial  manufacturing  process,  as  well  as  batch  analysis  data  of  clinical  batches, 
demonstrating  compliance  with  the  release  specification  and  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.

Stability of the product 
The conditions used in the stability studies are according to the ICH stability guideline. All batches 
were manufactured at the proposed commercial manufacturing site. The batches were stored in 
HDPE bottles with desiccant. 
The  primary  stability  data  include  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  each  strength  stored  at 
5°C/ambient  humidity  (24  months,  one  batch  per  strength),  25°C/60%  RH  (24  months)  and 
40°C/75% RH (six months). Significant changes were observed for DMSO content at 40°C/75% RH 
and decreasing trends were observed at the other storage conditions. Increasing trends were seen 
for water content. DMSO desolvation appeared to be dependent on temperature and moisture. As a 
consequence, storage in the refrigerator was evaluated as long term storage condition. 
Photostability of one batch of each strength was studied under ICH Q1B conditions. Tablets of the 
0.5 mg strength were not photostable when directly exposed to light or in the primary packaging. 
Tablets  of  the  1  mg  strength  were  photostable  in  the  primary  packaging.  Tablets  of  the  2  mg 
strength were photostable when directly exposed.  
Due  to  a  change  in  coating  of  the  tablets  of  the  0.5  mg  strength  in  view  of  the  insufficient 
photostability  in  the  primary  package,  a  change  in  the  dimensions  of  the  tablets  of  the  2  mg 
strength during development of the manufacturing process, and the observed DMSO desolvation, 
additional stability data were generated for three commercial scale batches of each strength stored 
at 5°C/ambient humidity (0.5 mg and 2 strengths: 12 – 18 months, 1 mg strength: six months), 
25°C/60%  RH  (0.5  mg  and  2  strengths:  12  –  18  months,  1  mg  strength:  six  months)  and 
40°C/75%  RH  (six  months).  No  significant  change  was  observed  at  5°C/ambient  humidity. 
Significant changes in DMSO content were observed after 24 months at 25°C/60% RH, however, 
specifications  were  met  when  tested  after  18  months  of  storage.  All  batches  failed  to  meet  the 
proposed DMSO content limit after six months at 40°C/75% RH. Statistical evaluation of the DMSO 
content data obtained at 5°C support a shelf life of at least 23 months. 
Tablets of the 0.5 mg strength with the adapted coating were photostable in the primary packaging 
while the tablets of the 2 mg strength with the adapted dimensions were photostable when directly 
exposed. 
In use stability studies showed that the product can be stored by patients at temperatures up to 
30°C for 30 days. Refrigerated storage for unopened bottles is applicable for the supply chain and 
for patients. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 18 months and storage conditions 
“Store in a refrigerator (2° to 8°C)” are justified. Once opened, the bottle may be stored for 30 days 
at not more than 30°C. The tablets should be kept in the bottle tightly closed to protect from light 
and moisture.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Mekinist  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  satisfactory  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical documentation has been submitted for marketing authorisation. The applicant has 
applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and their 
manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the active substance, nor for the finished product. Proven Acceptable Ranges were indicated for 
Critical Process Parameters and non-Critical Process Parameters. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The primary and secondary pharmacodynamics of trametinib were investigated in a number of in 
vitro and in vivo studies. 
Trametinib was tested in rats and dogs by oral gavage for the toxicology studies. In addition, safety 
pharmacology studies were carried out in rats (oral administration), in rabbit (oral administration), 
and in dogs (oral and iv administration over 10 minutes). Pivotal toxicology studies and most of the 
safety pharmacology studies were carried-out in compliance with GLP.

A series of in vitro and in vivo investigations have been conducted in order to characterise the 
primary pharmacology of trametinib with respect to the treatment of advanced cancer. It was 
shown that trametinib is a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular signal regulated 
kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. It inhibits MEK1 and 2 phosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation 
of ERK1 and 2 thereby inducing INK4B (p15) protein (an endogenous cyclin dependent kinase 
[CDK] inhibitor). Following a screening of kinases, it was shown that trametinib preferentially 
inhibits BRAFV600E-mediated MEK1 activation (IC50 = 0.7 nM) over phospho-MEK1 activity (IC50 
= 13 nM) and MEK2 activation (IC50 = 0.9 nM) over phospho-MEK2 activity (IC50 = 11 nM).   
Eighty (80) % of BRAF and 72% of RAS mutant cell lines were sensitive to trametinib. The minimum 
concentration of trametinib required to induce growth inhibition in highly sensitive BRAF mutant 
melanoma cell lines was >10.4 ng/mL (~15 nM). Trametinib caused G0/G1 arrest in HT-29 and 
Colo205 cells by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, resulting in quantitative and qualitative changes in 
cell cycle proteins downstream and subsequently induced apoptosis. 
Furthermore, the anti-proliferative properties of trametinib were shown in other human cell lines of 
haematological origin. However, trametinib generally showed poor to no activity against B-cell 
leukemia, B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt’s lymphoma. 
Trametinib was studied in combination with other anticancer drugs to determine the combinatorial 
effect on cell growth inhibition in a variety of cancer cell lines. Results showed that trametinib had 
mostly synergistic effects when combined with dabrafenib or a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor in BRAF mutant 
melanoma cell lines. However, twenty-four hours after treatment, the combination of trametinib 
with dabrafenib did not increase apoptosis more than either single agent alone in the eight 
BRAFV600E/K melanoma cell lines tested (data not shown).  
Biochemical and cellular activities of trametinib and the metabolite M5 (produced by deacetylation 
of trametinib) showed that both compounds were similarly active to inhibit BRAFV600E-mediated 
MEK1 activation, phospho-MEK1 activity, cellular phosphorylation of ERK and cellular proliferation 
of BRAFV600E mutant SK-MEL-28 cells. A second metabolite known as M7 (formed by 
mono-oxygenation of M5) inhibited the activated human MEK1 enzyme with approximately 10-fold 
less potency than trametinib having an IC50 value of 73 ± 4 nM compared to 7.0 ± 0.1 nM. Both 
most important metabolites occur in human plasma in about 10% of the total of trametinib and 
related compounds. 
Chronic administration in human tumour xenograft models in mice showed that trametinib was an 
orally efficacious MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor causing inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, and 
accumulation of p27 and reduction of Ki67, both markers of cell cycle arrest. It significantly 
inhibited the growth of melanoma xenografts by 82% after 21 days of dosing at 0.3 mg/kg. 
The anti-tumour efficacy of trametinib alone or in combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib 
was evaluated in A375PF11 BRAFV600E human melanoma mouse xenografts. The combination of 
trametinib with dabrafenib was well tolerated and resulted in delayed tumour resistance and 
significant survival improvement. Combination studies with extended dosing showed prolonged 
tumour growth inhibition and delayed tumour outgrowth when compared to treatment with the 
single agents. Sequential administration of one week dabrafenib (30 mg/kg) and the other week 
trametinib (3 mg/kg) for 11 weeks showed the best results in reduction of tumour volume.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Trametinib, as the parent compound or the DMSO solvate, was evaluated in a total of 50 kinase 
assays covering 44 unique kinase enzymes. Trametinib was inactive (IC50 >10 µM) against all but 
the B-RafV600E MEK1 cascade assay (BRAMA). This assay monitors the ATPase activity of 
phosphorylated-MEK1 that results from the phosphorylation of MEK by BRAFV600E. The IC50 of 63 
nM for trametinib was due to inhibition of MEK activation rather than the direct inhibition of 
BRAFV600E. Trametinib was also evaluated against 171 different kinase assays using an external 
kinase screening panel which found no significant (>50%) inhibition was observed when screened 
at a single concentration of 10 µM. In a separate study, trametinib was examined for effects in 7 
enzyme assays (phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase isoform 1 [COX1], constitutive NO synthase 
[NOS], phosphodiesterase 4, protein kinase C, acetylcholinesterase, monoamine oxidase A). 
Trametinib at a fixed concentration of 10 µM showed no significant inhibitory effect on these 
enzymes. 
Safety pharmacology 
At the relevant low dose of 3 mg/kg, tolerated by rats and dogs, with the exception of diarrhoea and 
inhibition of body weight gain, no significant effects on general behaviour, physiologic function or 
acute neurotoxicity were observed. However, administration of trametinib to rats at the high dose 
of 100mg/kg (non GLP) resulted in decreased body weight gain, sporadic incidence of reduced 
spontaneous locomotion, prone position, blepharoptosis, diarrhoea, piloerection and mydriasis, 
described in order of onset. Subsequent studies showed that this dose leads to morbidity and 
mortality. 
Following increasing oral doses of trametinib it was shown that it had no effect on the respiratory 
system of rats up to a dose of 0.125 mg/kg in which case it produced a mild, transient decrease in 
body temperature (up to 0.8°C) at 1 hour post dose. 
In a preliminary, in vitro screening assay, trametinib was found to inhibit hERG channel tail current 
in a concentration-dependent manner. In an in vitro rabbit preparation it was shown that trametinib 
produced significant decreases in isometric contractile force and the Tp-e interval at high 
concentrations. In a GLP study done on dogs with increasing oral doses, trametinib had no effect on 
ECG parameters, blood pressure or heart rate. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism and elimination of trametinib have been 
investigated in a series of oral or intravenous in vivo studies in the mouse, rat, dog, monkey and 
human, and in in vitro studies, using non-radiolabelled and 14C-labelled drug.   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 23/132 
 
  
  
Absorption 
Trametinib was absorbed slowly after oral dosing in the rat (Tmax 4-8 h), whereas peak plasma 
concentrations were reached 1-2 h post-dose in mouse and monkey and 3 h in dog. Oral 
bioavailability following administration of trametinib acetic acid solvate differed between species: 
111% in mice, 48% in rats, 86% in dogs and 49% in monkeys. After iv administration, trametinib 
showed a moderate to low plasma clearance in all species examined. The half-live values were long, 
3.7 h for mouse, 6.1 h for rat, 6.7 h for monkey and 14.5 h for dog. 
Distribution 
Drug-related radioactivity distributed into most tissues within 2 hours after oral administration. 
Highest tissue concentrations were measured in liver, kidney, renal cortex, Harderian gland, 
pancreas, salivary glands and adrenal cortex. Trametinib-related radioactivity was also distributed 
into the brain, although to a limited extent (brain-blood ratio: 0.1-0.6). Seven days after the single 
dose, drug-related radioactivity was still observed in spleen, kidney, liver and preputial gland, 
suggesting potential accumulation of trametinib-related material in these organs when 
administered daily. No selective association of trametinib-related radioactivity with 
melanin-containing tissues was observed. Studies on placental transfer of trametinib were not 
performed. 
Plasma protein binding 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of trametinib at high (0.5-5 μg/mL) and clinically relevant 
concentrations (0.001-0.05 μg/mL) was high in all species: 95% in mouse and 96% in rat, 97% in 
dog, 98% in monkey and 97% in human and no concentration dependency was observed. 
Partitioning of trametinib into red blood cells was low (blood-to-plasma ratio <0.9) in any of the 
species investigated in in vitro studies. Comparable partitioning was observed in in vivo studies at 
early time points post-dose, while a higher partitioning was observed at later time points post-dose 
(blood-to-plasma ratio 2-3). At clinically relevant concentrations, trametinib-related radioactivity 
was distributed preferably into blood cells by a factor 3 to 8. 
Metabolism 
Three metabolites of trametinib were identified in in vitro studies: M5, M6 and M7. These 
metabolites were all products of deacetylation, which is the predominant pathway in trametinib 
elimination. M7 was formed by deactetylation and oxidation, and CYP3A4 may be involved in the 
oxidative metabolism of trametinib. The major in vitro metabolites of trametinib observed in 
humans were also detected in the nonclinical species. 
The major circulating component in rats and dogs was unchanged trametinib, accounting for 
64-94% and 58-79% of total plasma radioactivity, respectively. A similar pattern was observed in 
humans. In both rats and dogs, the two Phase I metabolites M5 and M7 were detected in plasma at 
levels of <6% and 9% of drug-related material, respectively, while M6 (N-glucuronidation of M5) 
was detected in rat bile and accounted for <12% of the dose.  M5 is a pharmacologically active 
metabolite. A study regarding the plasma protein binding of M5 is still ongoing but preliminary data 
indicate that the free fraction of M5 is 1.2%.

Excretion 
The predominant route of elimination of drug-related radioactivity was via faeces in rats and dogs 
(59-98%). Most of the radioactivity was recovered in excreta within 3 days in rats and dogs. 
However, small amounts of radioactivity continued to be eliminated until 7 days, indicating 
protracted elimination consistent with the long half-lives. 
Metabolites M5 and M7 were observed in rat excreta, while only M7 was detected in dog excreta. As 
they were co-eluted with a number of other minor metabolites, exact levels of each could not be 
quantified. 
 Metabolites in human excreta included M5, M7 and M9 (O-glucuronidation of M7) although M9 was 
only observed as a minor component in urine.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The substrate characteristics of trametinib were investigated for P-gp and BCRP, and in vitro 
inhibition has been investigated for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In vitro data showed that 
trametinib is an inhibitor of both human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 P-gp BCRP. In addition, it was 
shown that trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and an inducer of 
CYP3A4. Trametinib is not a substrate of CYP enzymes.

Genotoxicity 
A standard package of genotoxicity studies was conducted with trametinib. In studies evaluating 
reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells and micronuclei in the 
bone marrow of rats, trametinib was not genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not performed with trametinib. In accordance with ICH S9 Nonclinical 
Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, carcinogenicity studies are not necessary for the 
approved indication.

dose which was given on the remaining days of treatment. 
** The first dose was given on post-natal days 7-21. The second dose (a higher dose) was given on post-natal 
days 22-35 due to decreased exposure between post-natal days 13-21. 
In accordance with ICH S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, no fertility nor 
pre- and post-natal development studies were conducted with trametinib.

Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics show that trametinib exposure in animals is very low in comparison to human 
(0.08-1.32xhuman based on Cmax and 0.09-1.24xhuman based on AUC). There was no clear effect 
of co-administration of trametinib or dabrafenib on the exposure to each agent in dogs.

and therefore was considered to be a 
sensitizer.  
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity and Immunotoxicity studies 
Other toxicity studies included antigenicity and immunotoxicity studies. A mouse lymph node assay 
carried out to assess antigenicity showed that trametinib was a skin sensitiser.  
Regarding the immunotoxicity of trametinib, in the repeated dose toxicity studies done on rats with 
a daily oral dosing for up to 13 weeks, it was shown that the principal immune-related adverse 
effect was bone marrow degeneration/necrosis and lymphoid necrosis in lymph nodes, spleen and 
thymus. In addition, adverse skin and gastric changes were associated with inflammation, 
characterized by increased cellularity (lymphocytes and plasma cells) in lymph nodes and 
decreased circulating mean lymphocyte counts (up to 63%). In these rats there was an increase in 
circulating leukocyte counts (neutrophils and monocytes), bone marrow myeloid hyperplasia, and 
increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in the spleen. All adverse findings had reversed or 
partially reversed at the end of the recovery period. 
The same gastrointestinal and hematopoietic perturbations were seen in studies on dogs under the 
same experimental conditions as for rats. Furthermore, in the dog 4-week combination study in 
which dogs were treated with trametinib and dabrafenib, decreased lymphoid cellularity of the 
thymus was observed at a lower dose than in the 3-week dog study in which only trametinib was 
given. 
Metabolites 
Active metabolites were metabolites M5 and M7; M5 with the same potency as trametinib and M7 
with tenfold lower potency. Both metabolites did not account though for more than 10% of the 
drug-related material.

Studies on impurities 
All impurities were specified below the qualification limit. Impurities that raised alerts for 
genotoxicity in in silico screening software (Derek version 13) were either controlled around or 
below the TTC of 1.5 µg/day or tested negative in an Ames test.  
Phototoxicity 
Trametinib absorbs light in the range 290 - 700 nm and it is distributed to the skin. Also, molar 
extinction coefficient values ≥ 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 were found at several wavelengths in the region of 
concern for photosafety at 314 and 337 nm. A quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) 
study in pigmented rats showed a wide tissue distribution of drug-related material, including the 
skin. In oral repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 13 weeks in rats and dogs, no toxicity has been 
identified in the eye; however, there were findings in the skin (acanthosis, ulceration, exudation 
and inflammation) of rats and dogs.

class) 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Trametinib is a reversible, highly selective, allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated extracellular 
signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2 activation and kinase activity. MEK proteins are 
components of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. In melanoma and other 
cancers, this pathway is often activated by mutated forms of BRAF which activates MEK. Trametinib 
inhibits activation of MEK by BRAF and inhibits MEK kinase activity. Trametinib inhibits growth of 
BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines and demonstrates anti-tumour effects in BRAF V600 mutant 
melanoma animal models. 
Metabolites M5, M6 and M7were identified in in vitro studies and were all products of deacetylation. 
Deacetylation is likely mediated by hydrolytic esterases, although the applicant did not investigate 
the enzyme(s) responsible for trametinib metabolism. M5 is a pharmacologically active metabolite 
with the same potency as trametinib. As the protein binding data of M5 indicated that it contributes 
to well below the 50% threshold of pharmacological activity, further assessment of M5 as a 
substrate or inhibitor of drug transporters is not warranted (EMA Guidance on the Investigation of 
Drug Interactions).Because of the potential risk that patients who became progressive after 
treatment with trametinib would not respond anymore to BRAF inhibitors, the applicant was 
requested to discuss the development of resistance on monotherapy with trametinib. According to 
the applicant, whether a follow-up treatment can be successfully performed with a BRAF-inhibitor 
would depend on the type of mutation and no conclusion could be drawn from the limited 
non-clinical data. This issue is further discussed in section 2.6 of the AR. 
In vitro and in vivo data suggest that trametinib is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of other 
medicinal products. Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and CYP2C19, an inducer of CYP3A4 and an inhibitor of the transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp 
and BCRP. However, based on the low clinical trametinib systemic exposure (0.04 µM) relative to 
the in vitro inhibition or induction values (> 0.34 µM), trametinib is not considered to be an in vivo 
inhibitor of these enzymes/transporters although transient inhibition of BCRP substrates in the gut 
may occur (see SmPC section 5.2). 
In  vivo  and  in  vitro  data  suggest  that  the  PK  of  trametinib  is  unlikely  to  be  affected  by  other 
medicinal  products.  As  trametinib  is  metabolised  predominantly  via  deacetylation  mediated  by 
hydrolytic  enzymes,  its  pharmacokinetics  are  unlikely  to  be  affected  by  other  agents  through 
metabolic interactions (SmPC section 5.2).   
Trametinib  is  neither  a  substrate  of  CYP  enzymes  or  of  the  efflux  transporters  P-gp  nor  BCRP. 
Trametinib is  deacetylated  via  hydrolytic  enzymes  which  are  not  generally  associated  with  drug 
interaction risk. However, drug-drug interactions via these hydrolytic enzymes cannot be ruled out 
and could influence the exposure to trametinib (see SmPC section 5.2).

The applicant was requested to provide information whether trametinib is an inhibitor or substrate 
of  liver  transporters  or  renal  transporters,  in  accordance  with  the  EMA  Guidance  on  the 
Investigation of Drug Interactions. While it is unlikely that trametinib at a low dose of 2 mg will 
affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  other  drugs,  the  risk  cannot  be  fully  excluded,  therefore  the 
applicant committed to investigate whether trametinib is an in vitro substrate of BSEP, MATE1 and 
MRP2 and whether trametinib exhibits transporter-mediated uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In 
vitro inhibition studies for renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, OAT3 will also be submitted. The in vitro 
transporter studies for trametinib with final reports for all transporters are expected to be available 
by Q1 2015 (see RMP). 
Dose separation of BCRP substrates and trametinib by 2 hours is likely sufficient to avoid any 
potential risk for a clinical drug interaction due to inhibition of BCRP by trametinib (see SmPC 
section 4.5). 
Toxicology studies were carried out by the oral route of administration as this is the proposed 
therapeutic route in humans. The species and strains used in these investigations were selected on 
the basis of similarities in the pharmacokinetic and metabolic handling of trametinib between the 
selected species and humans. There was high level of sequence identity for MEK1 between the 
species used in non-clinical safety testing (~99%). For MEK2 the sequence homology is somewhat 
less (81-97%). However, none of the observed differences are located in the active site or in the 
predicted binding site of trametinib. In repeat-dose studies the effects seen after trametinib 
exposure are found mainly in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, haematological system, bone and 
liver. Most of the findings are reversible after drug-free recovery. In rats, hepatocellular necrosis 
and transaminase elevations were seen after 8 weeks at ≥ 0.062 mg/kg/day (approximately 
0.8 times human clinical exposure based on AUC). In mice, lower heart rate, heart weight and left 
ventricular function were observed without cardiac histopathology after 3 weeks at 
≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day trametinib (approximately 3 times human clinical exposure based on AUC) for 
up to 3 weeks (SmPC section 5.2). The preclinical findings indicate a low likelihood of myocardial 
necrosis caused directly by trametinib. The vascular and myocardial calcification seen in mice is 
believed to be a consequence of altered calcium phosphorus homeostasis. The potential 
cardiotoxicity is further discussed from a clinical point of view in sections 2.6 and 2.8 of this AR. 
In rats, hypertrophy of the physis and increased bone turnover were observed, but the physeal 
hypertrophy is not expected to be clinically relevant for adult humans (SmPC section 5.2). The 
observations in adult rats were likely caused by the fact that in rats, the growth plates remain open 
until up to 60 to 80 weeks, whereas in humans, fusion and ossification of growth plates is completed 
by 20 years of age.  
In rats, mineralisation of multiple organs was associated with increased serum phosphorus and was 
closely associated with necrosis in heart, liver, kidney and haemorrhage in the lung at exposures 
comparable to the human clinical exposure (SmPC section 5.2). Serum phosphorous is considered 
a suitable marker for soft tissue mineralization. The publication by Diaz et al (2012) states that 
increased serum phosphorous levels with soft tissue mineralization caused by MEK inhibition 
appears to be rat specific; it was not observed in mice, dogs or monkeys following the 
administration of the MEK inhibitor PD-901. If serum phosphorous is not increased in patients, the 
soft tissue mineralization that was observed in rats is not expected to be clinically relevant.

In rats and dogs given trametinib at or below clinical exposures, bone marrow necrosis, lymphoid 
atrophy in thymus and GALT and lymphoid necrosis in lymph nodes, spleen and thymus were 
observed, which have the potential to impair immune function (SmPC section 5.2). 
Effects observed on the immune system were in some instances associated with inflammation 
resulting from effects on skin and gastrointestinal tract such as increased serum monocytes and 
neutrophils, increased cellularity in lymph nodes and decreased circulating lymphocytes. 
Carcinogenicity studies with trametinib have not been conducted. Trametinib was not genotoxic in 
studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria, chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells and 
micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats (SmPC section 5.2). 
In accordance with ICH S9, no fertility studies were conducted, however, trametinib may impair 
female fertility in humans, as in repeat-dose studies, increases in cystic follicles and decreases in 
corpora lutea were observed in female rats at exposures below the human clinical exposure based 
on AUC. However, in rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration, there were no 
treatment effects observed in male reproductive tissues (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the decrease in the numbers of copora lutea in non-pregnant rats, impaired female 
fertility may be possible. A warning regarding this possibility is present in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC. Unlike rats and rabbits, in humans the corpora lutea supports pregnancy until the 50th day 
of gestation (approximately the 1st trimester) before a luteal to placental shift occurs (Itskovitz, 
1988). Therefore, although the effect of trametinib on the functioning of corpus luteum of 
pregnancy is not entirely clear, the potential risk for human pregnancy is primarily limited to the 
first trimester.  
In reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, trametinib induced maternal and developmental 
toxicity. In rats decreased foetal weights and increased post-implantation loss were seen at 
exposures below or slightly above the clinical exposures based on AUC. In pregnant rabbits, 
decreased foetal body weight, increased abortions, increased incidence of incomplete ossification 
and skeletal malformations were seen at sub-clinical exposures based on AUC (SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on all these observations, trametinib was considered teratogenic in rabbits in the high dose 
group, which actually corresponded to exposures below the clinical exposure.  
Trametinib should not be administered to pregnant women or nursing mothers. If trametinib is used 
during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking trametinib, the patient should be 
informed of the potential hazard to the foetus (SmPC section 4.6). 
It is not known whether trametinib is excreted in human milk. Because many medicinal products are 
excreted in human milk, a risk to the breast-feeding infant cannot be excluded. A decision should be 
made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue trametinib, taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman (SmPC section 4.6). 
Proliferative skin lesions caused by dabrafenib alone when administered for at least 2 weeks were 
not observed in the combination study. Also in rats treated with another BRAF-inhibitor and another 
MEK1/MEK2-inhibitor, proliferative skin- and stomach lesions were diminished in the group treated 
with the combination. The limited data regarding trametinib-induced skin lesions that can be 
derived from the dog studies (effect much stronger in rats) suggest that skin toxicity caused by 
trametinib is not significantly increased by combination with dabrafenib.

No eye effects were observed non-clinically. There are however indications for eye toxicity caused 
by MEK inhibition in the literature. Eye toxicity has been observed from clinical experience and are 
further discussed in section 2.6 of the AR. 
Phototoxicity has not been sufficiently investigated. The applicant will submit an in vitro study of 
phototoxicity potential post-approval (as reflected in the RMP). 
The available data show that trametinib does not pose a potential risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for trametinib were 
considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects for the product 
trametinib. The applicant will conduct additional in vitro studies post authorisation to further 
investigate phototoxicity. In addition further in vitro studies will be conducted to determine the 
enzymes responsible for the hydrolytic cleavage of trametinib, the potential for saturation of P-gp 
and BCRP and whether trametinib is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and whether trametinib 
is an inhibitor of OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 (see RMP).

Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
Trametinib monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated 
clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:  
Trametinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Trametinib has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients 
who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (see section 5.1). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
After oral administration of 2 mg trametinib under fasted conditions, maximum plasma levels are 
obtained in approximately 1.5 hour. Geometric mean Cmax ranged from 6.7 to 9.1 ng/ml after 
single-dose administration. Trametinib is classified as a highly permeable compound. The mean 
absolute oral bioavailability of trametinib 2 mg tablet was moderate to high, i.e. 72.3%, based on 
AUC0-t. Based on the low solubility (consistent across all pH values) and moderate absolute 
bioavailability, it is considered a BCS class 4 drug. 
Following single dose administration, trametinib AUC0-24 increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner with a mean slope (90% CI) of the power model of 1.30 (1.08-1.52), 
while increases in Cmax were generally dose-proportional with a mean slope (90% CI) of the power 
model of 1.08 (0.90-1.25). Increases in Day 15 (steady-state) AUC0-24  and Cmax were generally 
dose-proportional with once-daily doses of 0.125 to 4 mg, and this was confirmed in another study 
for the 1 to 2 mg dose range.  
Steady state exposure is reached after approximately 15 days of OD administration of trametinib 2 
mg. The accumulation factor is approximately 6. 
The increase in exposure (Cmax and AUC) was dose-proportional following repeat dosing. Following 
administration of 2 mg daily, steady state geometric mean Cmax, AUC(0-t) and predose 
concentration were 22.2 ng/ml, 370 ng*hr/mL and 12.1 ng/ml, respectively with a low peak:trough 
ratio (1.8). Inter-subject variability at steady state was low (< 28 %). 
Trametinib accumulates with repeat daily dosing with a mean accumulation ratio of 6.0 at 2 mg QD 
dose. Steady-state was achieved by Day 15. 
The between-subject variability is larger for Cmax (58%) compared to the variability observed with 
AUC (38%). The variability in Cmax is lower after repeat daily dosing (28 to 36%) as trametinib 
accumulates about 6-fold due to its long half-life. No data on the intraindividual variation were 
obtained from pop-PK study 2011N120486_00.

Administration of a single, 2 mg oral tablet dose of trametinib with a high-fat, high-caloric meal 
affected both the rate and extent of absorption compared to fasting conditions with a 24 and 10% 
decrease in trametinib AUC0-t, and AUCinf, respectively, and a 70% decrease in Cmax. Trametinib is 
recommended to be administered under fasting conditions, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal, consistent with recommendations used in the Phase III study MEK114267. 
Distribution 
Plasma binding of trametinib is 97.4%. Trametinib accumulates to a limited extent in blood, with an 
in vitro blood:plasma ratio of approximately 3. Trametinib has a volume of distribution of 
approximately 1200 L determined following administration of a 5 μg IV microdose. 
Following single dose administration of [14C]-trametinib as oral solution to two subjects, about 
50% of circulating radioactivity in plasma wais present as the parent compound. Besides 
trametinib, deacetylated metabolite M5 and deacetylated/mono-oxygenated metabolite M7 were 
detected in plasma and accounted for <11% and <15% of plasma radioactivity, respectively. M6 
(the N-glucuronide of M5) was also detected and its levels were variable between the 2 subjects 
(either <10% or <24% of plasma radioactivity). Based on limited results after repeat dosing of 
trametinib, >75% of drug-related material in plasma was parent. 
Metabolism 
Trametinib appears to be metabolised predominantly via deacetylation (non-CYP450 mediated) 
alone or with mono-oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation 127. Although the specific 
enzyme responsible has not been identified, deacetylation is likely mediated by hydrolytic 
esterases, such as carboxylesterases or amidases. 
Elimination 
Trametinib terminal t1/2 is 127 hours (5.3 days) based on single dosing under fasted condition.  
A mass-balance study (MEK113708) was performed where two male subjects with solid tumour 
malignancies received a single oral dose of [14C]-trametinib as an oral suspension (2 mg, 79 μCi) 
in fasted state. All plasma, blood, urine and faeces were collected at various times or intervals 
through 240 hours post-dose. 
Faecal excretion appears the major route of elimination after [14C]-trametinib oral dose, with 81.3 
and 94.3% of the excreted dose in 10 days (39.2 and 35% of the administered dose) in the two 
patients, respectively, excreted in the faeces, with parent, M5, and M7 identified. Biliary / gut 
excretion is estimated to account for more than 25% of the drug elimination and attempts will be 
made to identify the involved transporters (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). Urine is the 
minor excretory pathway (18.6 and 5.6% of the excreted dose, 9.0 and 2.1% of the administered 
dose excreted in 10 days) with urinary drug related material consisting of parent, M5, M7, and M9. 
M5 and M7 are the major radio-components in urine while parent trametinib (<0.1% of excreted 
dose) and M9 were minor components. Furthermore, after repeated dosing the metabolites M12, 
M13, M15 and M17 were also identified. In vitro all metabolites have been formed and M7, M12 and 
M17 were all shown to be formed via CYP3A4. 
Geometric mean clearance (CL) was 3.21 L/hr after IV administration. Based on human liver blood 
flow of 81 L/hr and a blood:plasma ratio of approximately 3.4, trametinib CL is calculated to be 
approximately 1% of the liver blood flow.

Genetic polymorphism 
Trametinib appears to be metabolized predominantly via deacetylation likely mediated by 
hydrolytic esterases. Based on current experience, no issues related to polymorphic esterases are 
expected. 
Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of trametinib has not been investigated in a separate 
clinical study. In the two patients included in the mass balance Study MEK113708/11DMM005, less 
than 19% of the excreted dose (or <9% of the radioactive dose) was recovered in the urine as 
trametinib-related radioactivity and <0.1% of the excreted dose as trametinib parent. Based on the 
estimate of absolute bioavailability of 72.3%, the fraction that is excreted in the urine as trametinib 
is considered minimal. Renal impairment is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on trametinib 
PK given the low renal excretion of trametinib.   
In the population PK analysis 2011N1204860, which included 223 and 35 subjects with mild 
(glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 60-<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and moderate (GFR 30-<60 ml/min/1.73 
m2) renal impairment, respectively, the effect of GFR on trametinib CL/F was small (<6% for both 
categories) and not clinically relevant. No data are available in subjects with severe renal 
impairment and thus the potential need for dose adjustment in patients with severe renal 
impairment cannot be determined. 
Impaired hepatic function 
The PK of trametinib has not been evaluated in a separate clinical study in subjects with hepatic 
impairment. A study in subjects with hepatic impairment is ongoing (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology).   
In the population PK analysis, 64 subjects (13%) were categorized as having mild hepatic 
impairment based on the classification (bilirubin ≤ULN and AST> ULN or bilirubin> 1X-1.5 x ULN, 
AST: any value). No data from subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment was available. 
Oral clearance was not significantly different between subjects with mild impairment and subjects 
with normal hepatic function (2% difference). 
Gender 
Based on the pop-PK study 2011N1204860, CL/F of trametinib was 26% higher in male than in 
female subjects. Pop-PK data from Study 2011N1204860 indicate that for a typical 79 kg subject, 
the pop-PK estimated mean CL/F (95% CI) were 4.91 (4.64-5.18) l/h for female and 6.19 
(5.85-6.38) l/h for male subjects. 
Race 
The majority of subjects (97%) included in the supporting clinical trials were White. Therefore the 
effect of race was not tested in the pop-PK model.

Weight 
Based on the pop-PK study 2011N1204860, CL/F of trametinib increased with body weight. For the 
range of weights in the pop-PK analysis (41.2 to 152 kg), Cl/F was within 15% of the typical value 
when compared within male or female subjects. Female or male subjects with minimum/maximum 
body weight (41.2 and 152 kg) had a predicted AUC and Cmax within 15% and 30%, respectively, of 
the typical value observed with a median body weight of 79 kg. 
Elderly 
Based on the results of the population PK analysis, age as categorized in 3 groups <65 years (n = 
351), 65 to <75 years (n = 114), and ≥75 years (n = 28) had no significant effect on trametinib 
exposure, with differences in trametinib CL/F between age groups of <13% for either category 
relative to non-elderly adults. The patient age ranged from 19 to 92 years. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
For in vitro studies, see non-clinical pharmacokinetics. 
The Phase I/II dose-escalation Study BRF113220 investigated the safety, PK, PD and clinical 
activity of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination. The exposure of dabrafenib and its 
metabolites after a single 75-mg dose was not altered by co-administration of trametinib 2.0 mg 
once daily. Trametinib exposure did not change with co-administration of dabrafenib compared to 
historical monotherapy PK data (data not shown). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Exposure-efficacy relationship. Trametinib monotherapy 
A trametinib monotherapy dose-response was observed for tumour markers pERK, Ki67 and p27, 
with lower pERK and Ki67 at higher trametinib dose, and higher p27 at higher dose. The observed 
inhibition  of  pERK,  Ki67  and  increases  in  p27  confirms  inhibition  of  the  MAPK/ERK  pathway  by 
trametinib,  as  a  potential  explanation  of  efficacy.  At  the  2  mg  dose  level,  median  trough 
concentration  of  trametinib  on  Day  15  was  14.4  ng/ml,  which  is  above  the  pre-clinical  target 
concentration of 10.4 ng/ml. The final 2.0 mg dose level for trametinib was selected based on the 
safety  profile,  PD  and  preliminary  clinical  activity  in  Study  MEK111054.  The  3  mg  dose  was 
demonstrated to be the MTD (see clinical efficacy, dose-response studies). 
No clear trametinib exposure-PFS relationship was observed in the total patient population. Though 
in general, subjects with exposure above the median value had longer PFS than those below the 
median value with a HR <1, in all cases the HR 95% CI included the 1.0 no effect value. Correction 
for LDH, a known prognostic marker in subjects with melanoma, improved the results somewhat, to 
obtain a number of cases the HR 95% CI were <1. 
The tumour size model that was developed indicates an effect of trametinib on tumour size, with a 
significant drug effect on the model parameter describing the development of progression after an 
initial decrease in tumour size. Subjects with higher exposure are predicted by the model to have a 
longer duration of response than those with lower exposures.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The analytical methods have been sufficiently validated and are considered sufficiently robust to 
allow reliable determination of trametinib, and its metabolites in plasma.  
PK studies have been conducted in cancer patients. In all studies, patients with various types of 
solid tumours were included. In Study MEK111054, mostly melanoma patients were included, 
representing the targeted patient population. Relevant differences between the different kind of 
cancer patients are neither expected nor observed, and all PK data obtained in the various cancer 
patient populations are considered relevant to the melanoma population. 
The composition of the commercial tablets was only changed to an insignificant extent as compared 
to the tablets used in the clinical trials. Therefore, it is agreed that no bioequivalence study is 
necessary to bridge between the clinical and commercial formulations. 
The slight deviation from proportionality of the single dose trametinib AUC is not expected to 
negatively affect the use of trametinib in case dose reductions are applied in line with section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. 
The different strengths of the trametinib tablets are not dose-proportional. However, considering 
the dose-proportional PK upon repeated administration of trametinib, comparative bioavailability 
studies between these tablet strengths are not considered necessary. 
Based on currently available data, the clinical impact of the effect of food on trametinib exposure 
with repeat dosing is unclear. In Study MEK113709, decreases of 70%, 24%, and 10% were noted 
with Cmax, AUC(0-last), and AUC(0-inf), respectively, when trametinib was administered with a 
high-fat, high-calorie meal relative to administration of trametinib under fasted conditions. Based 
on predicted mean concentration time profiles at steady-state (data not shown) the differences 
between fed/fasting predicted after repeat dosing were 46% for Cmax, 24% for AUC(0-inf) and 31% 
for Cmin, with the point estimates of the differences between fed and fasting dosing outside the 
80-125% acceptance criteria.  Thus, it appears credible that there is a potential for a significant 
difference in Cmax due to food intake.  Given the lack of understanding regarding which 
pharmacokinetic parameter (Cmax or AUC) drives the response, a specific recommendation to take 
trametinib in the fasting state has been included in the SmPC. Trametinib is recommended to be 
administered under fasting conditions, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal, consistent with 
recommendations used in the Phase III study MEK114267. Trametinib should be taken orally with 
a full glass of water. Trametinib tablets should not be chewed or crushed (SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2). Following single dose administration of [14C]-trametinib as oral solution, about 50% of 
circulating radioactivity in plasma is present as the parent compound. Based on limited results after 
repeat dosing of trametinib, >75% of drug-related material in plasma is parent. The reason for this 
difference (50% vs >75%) is not completely understood, but may be related to e.g. the low number 
of patients included, the use of a non-validated method in Study 09DMM056, the different dose, the 
dose-dependent blood:plasma ratio, and accumulation of trametinib.  
Trametinib  was  the  most  abundant  substance  in  plasma.  Unbound  plasma  levels  of  other 
metabolites in plasma were lower than that of trametinib, and/or their activity was lower. Therefore 
the parent trametinib is considered responsible for activity of trametinib.

The popPK data regarding renal impairment suggest no effect of mild or moderate renal 
impairment. Based on the limited importance of renal excretion for trametinib clearance, the lack of 
a study in renally impaired patients is considered agreed. In light of the lack of data in severe 
renally impaired patients, caution is advised as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The high absolute bioavailability and low CL suggest low hepatic extraction of trametinib in addition 
to low first-pass metabolism, hence trametinib is considered a low hepatic clearance drug.  
Data for moderate and severe hepatically impaired patients are currently missing. The exposure to 
trametinib may be expected to be increased as hepatic disease affects metabolism, transport and 
biliary excretion which are the primary routes of elimination of trametinib. The population PK 
analysis indicated no significant effect of mild hepatic impairment on the PK of trametinib. However, 
hepatic function was only determined based on bilirubin and AST in this study, none of which might 
be a good marker for metabolic impairment. Nevertheless, it is currently acceptable not to include 
a specific warning in the SmPC for mild hepatic impairment, as MTD has not been reached with the 
2mg QD dosing. Study MEC116354, a Phase I and pharmacokinetic study evaluating trametinib in 
patients with hepatic dysfunction is being conducted under the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP). The Applicant has committed to submit the final study 
report after completion of the study in Q4 2017.  Until such further data regarding moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment are available, trametinib should be used with caution in such patients 
(SmPC section 4.2). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, gender and body weight were found to influence 
trametinib oral clearance. Based on additional analyses (data not shown), the effect of sex on CL 
was partially attributed to weight differences, and heavier patients were predicted to achieve a 
lower exposure of unclear magnitude. To further evaluate the effect of body weight, the applicant 
presented efficacy data (ORR and PFS) from the phase III study stratified according to quartiles of 
body weight. No treatment by covariate interaction with body weight was observed for PFS, whilst 
ORR was lower (15%) in heavier patients relative to other groups (21 to 25%). However, the 
differences were not statistically significant and based on the totality of data, patients with high 
body weight responded similarly to treatment with trametinib as patients with lower body weight. In 
conclusion, although lower weight female subjects are predicted to have higher exposure than 
heavier male subjects, these differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage 
adjustment is warranted (SmPC section 5.2).Although the potential for drug-drug interactions for 
trametinib seems low, relevant in vivo inhibition of intestinal BCRP in the intestine cannot be 
excluded based on in vitro data (see discussion on Non-clinical aspects).  
No initial dose adjustment is required in patients > 65 years of age.

Based on non-clinical data, trametinib should be considered a potential human teratogen, and 
according to the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions, for such substances a study for 
the in vivo effects on oral contraceptives has to be performed regardless of in vitro induction results. 
Until data on this potential interaction are available, the SmPC indicates that highly effective 
contraception should be used by female patients during treatment with trametinib and for 4 months 
after treatmen . The applicant is recommended to conduct a drug interaction study (Study 
MEK113707) with an oral contraceptive to assess the effect of repeat-dose trametinib on the 
repeat-dose pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone. Until data on this potential 
interaction are available, effective contraception should be used by patients as well as their 
partners. To prevent pregnancy, female patients using hormonal contraception are advised to use 
an additional or alternative method during treatment and for 4 months following discontinuation of 
trametinib (SmPC section 4.6). 
An increase in the proportion of subjects experiencing pyrexia was noted with administration of 
trametinib in combination with dabrafenib, compared to administration of dabrafenib as 
monotherapy (data not shown). There was no evidence that the increase in pyrexia was related to 
trametinib exposure. The lack of data in children <18 years is indicated in the SmPC section 4.2. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of trametinib has been adequately investigated. Additional data will be 
provided by the Applicant in relation to special patient populations and drug metabolism. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The dosage for trametinib that is recommended for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation is 2.0 mg orally QD (once daily). This dose was 
selected based on safety and tolerability and also on exposure-response relationship with tumour 
and clinical activity. From preclinical studies it was already known that the target trametinib 
concentration of >10.4 ng/mL could be achieved with the oral intake of 2 mg trametinib daily.  
Monotherapy: 
The phase I study MEK111054 was an open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter (12, all US), 
dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the 
trametinib in subjects with solid tumours or lymphoma. 
Study period: Initiation Date: 31 July 2008 (First Subject First Visit), Completion Date: 07 June 
2011 (Data cut-off date for study report)

Regimens 
Parts 1 and 2: 
21/7 Regimen: Once daily (QD) dosing for 21 days, followed by 7 days without drug. 
LD Regimen: One or two loading doses (LD) followed by continuous QD dosing (abbreviated LD/QD 
or LD/LD/QD regimen) 
QD Regimen: Continuous QD dosing (abbreviated QD regimen) 
Part 3: 
QD/QD Regimen: Continuous QD dosing at ≤2.5 mg QD from Days 1 to 15, followed by continuous 
QD dosing at either 2.0 mg or 2.5 mg (abbreviated QD/QD). 
Results 
In this study the maximum tolerated dose was defined as 3 mg QD. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) 
were rash (grade 3, 2 pts), diarrhea (grade 3, 1 patient) and chorioretinopathy (grade 2, 2 
patients). The incidence of AEs ≥ grade 3 in the 2.0 mg QD dose group was considered acceptable 
(14%) when compared with the higher 2.5 and 3 mg QD dose groups (23 and 31% respectively). 
With the 2 mg QD no AE grade ≥ 4 was encountered. 
Based on the safety, efficacy, PD and PK data from this study trametinib 2.0 mg once-daily was 
chosen as the dose to be administered in study MEK113583 and pivotal study MEK114267.  
Combination therapy: 
The Phase Ib/II study BRF113220 was an open-label, dose-escalation, multicentre (2 Australia, 12 
US) study to investigate the Safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of 
dabrafenib in combination with trametinib in subjects with BRAF Mutant Metastatic Melanoma 
(Parts A,B,D).  
Part B of the study was the dose escalation part. For further details on the study methods, (see 
section 2.5.2).

Subjects (n=135) were enrolled in escalating dose cohorts of dabrafenib and trametinib in a 
traditional “3(4) +3” design to identify the range of tolerated doses. 
A dose-to-event relationship with regard to safety and efficacy for the different dabrafenib and 
trametinib combination regimen was not established. Therefore, in addition to the full monotherapy 
doses (150 mg BID of dabrafenib and 2 mg daily of trametinib), a second treatment group of 
dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 1 mg daily was selected for Part C in order to elucidate the 
contribution of trametinib to the combination regimen. 
In part C of the Study BRF113220 the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib 150 BID in combination with 
2 mg or 1 mg trametinib (QD) was compared with dabrafenib 150 BID monotherapy. The five most 
encountered AE with the combination treatment are pyrexia, chills, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. 
In Study BRF113220 only trametinib doses up to 2 mg have been explored.

Treatments 
Study treatments were trametinib (2 mg once daily under fasting conditions, i.e., at least 1 hour 
before a meal or at least 2 hours after a meal), or chemotherapy consisting of either dacarbazine 
(1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks), or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) at investigator discretion, 
provided the patient had not received that type of chemotherapy prior to randomization. Patients 
receiving chemotherapy were allowed to crossover to trametinib after confirmation of progression 
by independent assessment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to test the superiority of trametinib over chemotherapy with respect to 
progression-free survival (PFS) for melanoma patients with BRAF V600 mutation. The secondary 
objectives included the evaluation of: 
• 
PFS in the subgroup of patients chemo naive and the subgroup who had received 1 prior 
chemotherapy in the advanced or metastatic setting;  
• 
overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR) in patients with BRAF V600E 
mutation-positive melanoma; ORR and DoR in patients with BRAF V600K mutation-positive 
melanoma;  
• 
efficacy (PFS, ORR, and DoR) in the overall study population and in patients following 
crossover from chemotherapy to trametinib;  
• 
the safety and PK of trametinib in patients with metastatic melanoma. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoints of MEK114267 study originally were OS & PFS (co-primary endpoints). 
Before the data cut-off date, the primary endpoint was amended to PFS (investigator assessment). 
The primary efficacy population was the subset of the ITT population with BRAF V600E subjects 
without a prior history of brain metastases 
Secondary endpoints included PFS in ITT (also including patients with BRAF V600K mutation and/or 
history of brain metastasis) and subpopulations, OS in primary and ITT, ORR in primary and ITT and 
Duration of response, safety, PK. 
Disease progression and response evaluations were determined according to the definitions 
established in the RECIST v 1.1, using radiological and clinical disease assessment for palpable 
lesions at baseline and at week 6, 12, 21, 30 and every 12 week thereafter. 
Exploratory endpoints included evaluation of health related of quality of life (HRQoL), PK, PD,  
correlation of BRAF mutation in cfDNA with that in the tumour tissue, biomarkers (mutations in 
BRAF, MEK1/2,PTEN and other genes, and expression of genes and proteins), and 
pharmacogenetics. HRQoL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and 
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) version 3 and the 
EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) at Screening; Weeks 6, 12, 21 and 30; and every 12 weeks (± 7days) until 
determination of progressive disease (PD), and 6 weeks following disease progression.

Sample size 
A total of 322 patients were assessed for the ITT population, including 40 patients with BRAF V600K 
mutations, 1 patient with a BRAF V600 E/K mutation, and 11 patients with a prior history of brain 
metastases.  
Randomisation 
Before centralised randomization eligible patients were stratified for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
(above upper limit of normal [ULN] vs. equal to or below ULN) and prior chemotherapy for advanced 
or metastatic disease (yes vs. no). 
Subjects in each stratum were centrally randomized (randomized phase) through the Registration 
and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS) (Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]). 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable 
Statistical methods 
PFS was censored if there was more than one subsequently missed assessment visit, and if new 
therapy was started without scan-evidence of progression.  Robustness of PFS for investigator bias 
was assessed by performing a blind independent review.  
The impact of baseline covariates on PFS was investigated using a stepwise Cox regression (BRAF 
mutation (V600K vs. V600E), prior History of Brain Metastases (Yes vs. No), Prior treatment with 
chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease: (Yes vs. No), Prior immunotherapy (Yes vs. No), 
Baseline ECOG performance status: (0 vs. 1), Baseline LDH: (above ULN vs. equal to or below ULN), 
Stage at Screening (III, IVM1a, IVM1b vs. IVM1c), Visceral Disease at Baseline (yes/no), Number of 
disease sites at baseline (<3 vs. ≥3), Sex (Male vs. Female), Age (continuous)).

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled by 86 sites in 19 countries from December 2010 to July 2011.  
Conduct of the study 
The  original  study  protocol  dated  24-august-2010,  was  amended  5  times.    Main  amendments 
consisted of: 
1-Date  18  October  2010.  The  amendment  changed  the  primary  endpoint  to  PFS  and  added 
crossover to trametinib after progression on the chemotherapy arm bases on feedback from the 
European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA),  changed  the  ophthalmological  guidelines,  modified 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria  to  allow  prior  treatment with  ipilimumab  in  the  adjuvant  setting  and 
patients with brain metastases meeting specific criteria.

2-Date  02  May  2011.  The  amendment  changed  eligibility  criteria  requiring  documented  disease 
progression prior to randomization, changed eligibility criteria for patients with brain metastases to 
indicate that prior whole brain radiotherapy was not allowed and confirmation of stable and/or no 
evidence of disease was required prior to randomization, allowed crossover after discontinuation of 
chemotherapy only after documentation of disease progression,  
3-Date 03 October 2011. The amendment restricted the Primary Efficacy population to patients with 
a BRAF V600E mutational status without history of prior brain metastases. 
4- Date 27 January 2012. The amendment included information, management and guidelines for 
monitoring and treatment of hypertension. 
5-  Date  5  February  2012.  The  amendment  allowed  immediate  crossover,  after  advice  of  the 
Independent Data Monitory Committee of any patient enrolled in the chemotherapy arm. 
Amendments 4 and 5 were effective after the data cut-off date.

Table 7: Principal demographic and Baseline Prognostic Factors (ITT Population study MEK114267) 
The majority of patients in this study were white (>99%), with a median time since metastatic 
diagnosis of 7.29 months (range 0.16-204.22).  
The most common (≥20% in either treatment arm) locations of disease were lymph nodes, lung, 
liver, and subcutaneous tissue.

Table 8: Prior Anticancer Therapy (ITT Population MEK114267) 
Among trametinib treated patients, 35% received prior chemotherapy which was given in the 
adjuvant setting in 4% of patients and in the advanced or metastatic setting in 33% of patients. In 
the trametinib arm 32% received prior immunotherapy, preferentially as adjuvant therapy in 25% 
of patients and primarily with interferon. In the trametinib arm, 25% of patients received prior 
radiotherapy and 3 patients received prior ipilimumab primarily as adjuvant therapy (2 of the 3 
patients). Dacarbazine was the most common prior anticancer therapy received for both treatment 
arms.

ORR in subgroups 
ORR was analysed for the following subgroups: Primary Efficacy Population without or with prior 
chemotherapy; ITT population subgroup with V600E mutation or with V600K mutation.  
The ORR for patients in the trametinib arm with or without prior chemotherapy was similar. For 
patients on chemotherapy arm who had received prior chemotherapy the ORR was zero; however, 
there  were  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  with  stable  disease  compared  with  patients  in  the 
chemotherapy arm who had not received prior chemotherapy. 
The ORR data by mutation status are described in table 14.

2.5.2.2.1.  Pivotal Study BRF113220 
An  open-label,  dose-escalation,  Phase  IB/II  study  to  investigate  the  safety,  pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of the BRAF inhibitor GSK2118436 in combination with the 
MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 in subjects with BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma. Part C of study 
BRF113220  was  considered  the  pivotal  study  supporting  the  application  of  the  combination 
treatment dabrafenib and trametinib. 
Methods 
The study comprised 4 parts, of which Parts A, B, and D together constituted the Phase I part, and 
Part C constituted the randomised Phase II part of the study.

Study Participants 
Subjects with BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma were required for Part D; other BRAF 
mutation-positive tumour types could be enrolled in Part A and Part B as well with approval of the 
GSK Medical Monitor. 
Subjects  with  BRAF  mutant  melanoma  who  had  prior  exposure  to  BRAF  inhibitors  (BRAFi)  or 
subjects with BRAF mutant colorectal cancer were enrolled to Part B expansion cohorts. 
Patients in Part C were required to have an unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma 
harbouring a BRAF V600 mutation (i.e. V600E, V600K or V600D) and measurable disease according 
to RECIST criteria. 
Patients  with  prior  exposure  to  BRAF  or  MEK  inhibitors,  or  prior  anti-cancer  therapy  in  the 
metastatic setting with the exception of up to one regimen of chemotherapy and/or interleukin-2 
were excluded. Also, patients with active brain metastases or cardiac comorbidities were excluded. 
Treatment 
Dabrafenib was taken twice daily, approximately 12 hrs apart. Trametinib was taken once daily. 
Both drugs were taken orally with approximately 200 mL of water either one hour before or 2 hours 
after a meal. Subjects were encouraged to take study drug daily at approximately the same times 
of day. 
Patients in part C of study BRF113220 were randomized to 3 arms: dabrafenib 150 mg BID + 
trametinib 2 mg QD (150/2 combination), dabrafenib 150 mg BID + trametinib 1 mg QD (150/1 
combination), and dabrafenib monotherapy at 150 mg BID alone. For the combination treatment 
dabrafenib 150 mg was taken twice daily orally, approximately 12 hours apart. Trametinib was 
taken once daily.  
Patients who progressed on the dabrafenib monotherapy arm had the opportunity to receive 
dabrafenib and trametinib (2 mg) in combination dosing upon disease progression.

RECIST 1.1 criteria, and physical examination (as indicated for palpable superficial lesion). There 
was no planned adjustment for multiplicity. 
Part D

The following sections will be focusing on Part C of the study. 
Sample size 
With a sample size of 50 patients for each arm (planned sample size for BRF113220 Part C), for the 
comparison  of  each  combination  treatment  to  monotherapy  trametinib,  the  study  had  82% 
statistical  power  to  detect  an  absolute  17%  decrease  in  cuSCC  in  patients  who  received  the 
combination dose of dabrafenib and trametinib (pC=3%) compared to patients who received 150 
mg  two  time  a  day  dabrafenib  administered  alone  (pM=20%).  The  rate  of  20%  for  dabrafenib 
monotherapy  was  hypothesized  based  on  Phase  I  data  and  published  data  with  vemurafenib. 
Fisher’s  exact  test  was  utilized  in  the  calculations,  and  a  nominal  type  I  error  rate  of  0.05  was 
assumed.  
The  sample  size  calculation  was  not  based  on  the  primary  endpoints  (PFS,  ORR,  DoR),  which 
underlines that this phase I/II trial was not planned to provide confirmatory evidence on the efficacy 
of  the  combination.  This  is  also  clear  from  the  more  serious  fact  that  no  confirmatory  testing 
strategy was planned.  A total of 162 patients were enrolled.  
Randomisation 
Patients  in  BRF113220  Part  C  were  assigned  with  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  study  treatment  (150/2 
combination, 150/1 combination or 150 mg dabrafenib alone) in accordance with the randomization 
schedule generated by Discovery Biometrics, prior to the start of the study, using validated internal 
software. Patients were not stratified for key prognostic variables.  
Blinding (masking) 
This  was  an  open-label  study.  The  assessment  of  the  efficacy  results  is  based  on  investigator 
assessment  and  blinded  independent  central  review  (BICR).  In  addition,  independent  review  by 
ECHO was also conducted. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 70/132 
 
 
  
  
Statistical methods 
Comparisons of each of the combination arms vs the monotherapy arm were planned for each of the 
primary endpoints. PFS was censored for  symptomatic progression without scan-evidence, start 
new therapy with scan-evidence of progression, and PD or death after more than two visits.. Eight 
sensitivity analyses were planned to investigate the robustness of PFS against these censoring rules 
and possible discrepancy between PFS by blinded independent review vs PFS.  
One efficacy interim analysis was planned when 75 patients across the three treatment arms had 
completed at least three post-dose disease assessments.

Conduct of the study 
Part C was initially designed as non-randomized expansion cohorts based on doses identified in Part 
B, with enrolment of approximately 20 patients per dose cohort. A pre-specified interim analysis of 
Part C safety and efficacy data by treatment arm was conducted. Based on the discussion of the 
results of the interim analysis with health authorities the protocol was amended; sample size was 
increased, a randomization procedure and a dabrafenib monotherapy arm were added, a Blinded 
Independent  Central  Review  (BICR)  was  introduced  and  several  sensitivity  analyses  were 
pre-specified  for  the  final  analysis  in  order  to  facilitate  a  more  robust  evaluation  of  safety  and 
tolerability of the combination. Furthermore OS was included as a secondary endpoint.  
The amendments  for randomization and sample size increase were implemented before start of 
recruitment and therefore this strategy was not driven by trial results.

Outcomes and estimation 
PFS 
According to the investigators treatment with 150/2 combination therapy resulted in a statistically 
significant  improvement  in  investigator-assessed  PFS  compared  to  treatment  with  dabrafenib 
monotherapy, with a HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25- 0.62; p<0.0001). The median PFS was 9.4 months 
for  patients  treated  with  150/2  combination  therapy  and  5.8  months  for  patients  treated  with 
dabrafenib monotherapy. A Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS rate showed in the 150/2 combination 
group a proportion of 41% of the patients remaining progression-free at 12 months compared with 
9% with dabrafenib monotherapy. Likewise, treatment with 150/1 combination therapy resulted in 
a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  investigator-assess  PFS  compared  to  treatment  with 
dabrafenib monotherapy, with an HR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.87, p=0.0057). 
Results from Blinded Independent Central Review are summarised in the below table.

Overall Survival 
With a median follow-up time of 14 months and a total of 51 deaths in the study, OS data are not 
yet mature and median OS has not been reached on any treatment group.

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS at 12 months was 79% (95%CI: 66, 88) for 150/2 combination 
therapy, compared with 68% (95% CI: 54, 79) for 150/1 combination therapy and 70% (95% CI: 
55,  80)  for  dabrafenib  monotherapy.  The  OS  estimates  for  the  monotherapy  group  includes 
patients who crossed over (81% of randomized monotherapy patients).

During the procedure, the Applicant submitted an overall survival analysis based upon the March 
2013 data cut-off of BRF113220. As of this data cut-off, 51% of patients had died (83/162) across 
all three arms and the median follow-up was 24 months.  
Eighty three percent (83%) of the dabrafenib monotherapy population crossed over to 150/2 upon 
disease progression, and the additional time on combination is counted in the randomized 
monotherapy treatment summaries.

Independent assessment (BICR analysis) showed that the 150/2 combination group resulted in a 
higher  ORR  compared  to  dabrafenib  monotherapy,  although  the  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant.  BICR-assessed  confirmed  ORRs  for  both  the  150/2  and  150/1  combination  therapy 
groups were lower than the investigator-assessed rates. The BICR-assessed confirmed ORR was 
61% (95% CI; 46.9%- 74.1%) for the 150/2 combination group compared with 46% (95% CI: 
32.6%, 60.4%) for the dabrafenib monotherapy group. Ten patients (6%) from all 3 treatment 
groups  had  responses  classified  as  “Non-CR/Non-PD”,  because  the  BICR  could  not  find  target 
lesions and thus, could not assess if these patients had PRs.  
The ORR analysis does not show a benefit of the 150/1 combination when compared to dabrafenib 
monotherapy.  
Duration of response  
The  duration  of  the  response  to  dabrafenib  monotherapy  and  the  combination  regimen  in 
BFR113220,  as  assessed  by  Blinded  Independent  Central  Review,  show  an  equal  result  for  the 
combination 150/2 as well as the monotherapy dabrafenib (150 mg DQ): median DoR 7.6 months. 
The combination 150/1 shows median DoR of 11.3 months).  
Cross-over Phase Efficacy Results - Investigator-assessed ORR 
The  best  confirmed  ORR in  the  crossover  phase  was  9%  (95%  CI:  2.6,  22.1),  with  47%  of the 
patients achieving SD and 37% having an assessment of PD.  
Among the patients who crossed over, PRs were only observed in patients who had either CRs, or 
PRs while on dabrafenib monotherapy. The ORR in this subgroup of patients was 17% (95% CI: 4.7, 
37.4). All the four patients who had PRs after crossover received more than 6 months of dabrafenib 
monotherapy before crossing over to combination therapy.  
Many  patients  in  BRF113220  that  encountered  PD  have  received  next  line  treatment  and  the 
resulting effectiveness is reflected in the overall disappointing response rate. 
As stated, it is nevertheless remarkable that a response of the combination regimen 150/2 could be 
observed  after  having  had  progressive  disease  (i.e.  resistance)  during  the  prior  treatment  with 
dabrafenib monotherapy.

2.5.2.2.2.  Phase III study MEK115306 – headline results 
Study design 
Study  MEK115306  is  a  multi-centre,  multi-national,  randomized,  double-blind,  active-controlled 
phase III trial comparing dabrafenib 150 mg BID + trametinib 2 mg OD versus dabrafenib 150 mg 
BID  +  placebo  as  first  line  therapy  in  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic    BRAF  V600E/K 
mutation-positive  cutaneous  melanoma.  A  total  of  423  patients  have  been  randomized  (1:1)  to 
receive either dabrafenib 150 mg BID + trametinib 2mg OD or dabrafenib 150 mg BID + placebo. 
Randomization was stratified by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (> the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) versus ≤ ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E vs V600K).  
An external independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) monitored the conduct of the study, 
periodically assessed safety information, and also reviewed efficacy data at the time of the final 
PFS/interim OS analyses. The Applicant states that the study fully adhered to the principles outlined 
in the “Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP)” International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Tripartite Guideline, or with local law.  
The  primary  objective  of  the  MEK115306  study  was  to  show  superiority  of  the  combination 
dabrafenib-trametinib  versus  dabrafenib-placebo  in  terms  of  Progression  Free  Survival  (PFS), 
according to investigator assessment. Secondary objectives included Overall Survival (OS), overall 
tumour  response  rate  (ORR),  duration  of  response  (defined  as  the  time  from  first  documented 
evidence  of  CR  or  PR  until  disease  progression  or  death  due  to  any  cause  among  subject  who 
achieve an overall response), safety and pharmacokinetics. Exploratory objectives were evaluation 
of  health  related  quality  of  life  (according  to  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  EQ-5D  questionnaires)    and 
pharmacogenomics. A PFS analysis according to a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) 
according to RECIST 1.1 criteria was performed as a sensitivity analysis. 
Patients were to be treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Up to 
2 dose reductions due to toxicity were allowed. Of note, after protocol amendments 1, 4 and 6, 
patients experiencing disease progression were allowed to continue treatment beyond progression 
at discretion of the medical monitor if they had achieved an objective (partial or complete) response 
or had imaging evidence of tumour reduction lasting at least 8 weeks. Moreover, cross-over from 
the dabrafenib-placebo arm to the combination arm was not allowed.

EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 82/132 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 70% increase in PFS (i.e., HR: 0.5889, 
median PFS of 5.3 and 9 months in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm and the combination therapy 
arm, respectively). Assuming one-sided overall alpha of 0.025, power of 90%, and a randomisation 
ratio of 1:1 a total of 155 events (progression or deaths) were estimated to be required. According 
to  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP),  with  155  events  it  would  have  been  possible to  detect  an 
improvement as low as 37.7% (HR=0.726 which equates to median PFS of 7.3 and 5.3 months, 
respectively) with statistical significance. At the time of the final PFS analysis an interim OS was 
planned.  According  to  the  SAP,  patients  were  to  be  followed  for  survival  until  70%  of  the  total 
enrolled population had died or was lost to follow-up. 
According to the Applicant due to 24% over-enrolment (423 patients instead of the planned 340), 
it was decided to perform the final PFS analysis after 193 events (instead of the originally planned 
155) which represents the same percentage (45.6%) of total enrolment as originally planned. This 
change was expected to increase the overall power from 90% to 95%. 
Baseline characteristic patients in MEK115306  
In  order  to  be  eligible  for  the  study,  patients  were  required  to  have  histologically  confirmed 
cutaneous  melanoma  stage  IIIc  or  IV  with  a  BRAF  V600E  or  K  mutation  as  centrally  assessed 
according to the bioMerieux THxID BRAF Assay, measurable disease according to RECIST criteria, 
ECOG PS 0 or 1. Prior treatment with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor, as well as prior systemic treatment 
(with exclusion of adjuvant therapy) was not allowed. Adjuvant treatment with ipilimumab must be 
ended  at  least  8  weeks  prior  to  randomisation.  Patients  with  brain  metastases  were  allowed  to 
participate  if  asymptomatic  without  use  of  neither  corticosteroids  nor  enzyme  inducing 
anticonvulsivants and radiographically stable for at least 12 weeks prior to randomisation. Exclusion 
criteria consisted also of history or evidence or predisposing factors for retinal vein occlusion or 
central serous rethinopathy.

In study MEK115306, PFS analysis by investigator assessment was based on events in half of 
patients (combination: 102 events, 48%; monotherapy: 109 events, 51%).

Overall survival 
At the time of the final PFS analysis, an interim analysis of OS was performed as specified in the 
protocol. The final analysis of OS is planned when 70% of the total enrolled population has died or 
been lost to follow up. The data presented below are based on an August 26, 2013 data cut-with 211 
(50%) PFS events and 95 (22%) OS events. Events for the final analysis of OS are projected for Q1 
2015.  
CHMP assessment report

Page 87/132 
 
 
  
  
The planned interim analysis of Overall Survival occurred at a time when 95 patients had died (40 
in the combination arm and 55 in the monotherapy arm). With a median follow-up time of 
approximately 9 months on each arm, the median OS point estimate have not yet been reached.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Trametinib has not been studied in children (< 18 years) or in pregnant or lactating women. More 
than  99%  of  patients  enrolled  in  the  studies  performed  with  Trametinib  to  date  were  whites, 
therefore data are lacking in patients with other races (e.g., blacks, Asians, etc.). 
The  lack  of  efficacy  data  in  certain  populations,  like  paediatric  patients,  pregnant  or  lactating 
women, patients with race other than white, are adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
No  data  is  available  with  trametinib  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  and  moderate  or 
severe hepatic impairment. The SmPC recommends that trametinib in these patients is used with 
caution.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Due to differences in patient populations (e.g. number of prior treatment regimens and histological 
subtype),  study  designs  (including  differences  in  assessment  schedule  for  PFS),  and  endpoints, 
efficacy data have not been integrated.

The overall response rate (ORR) for trametinib in the intent to treat population of MEK114267 
(22%) was lower than that reported for BRF113683 (50%) or BRIM-3 (48%). However the 
proportion of patients with stable disease was higher for trametinib treated patients in the 
MEK114267 study (56%) compared to BRF113683 (42%). The median duration of response for 
patients receiving trametinib in MEK114267 was 5.5 months, which was similar to the duration of 
response observed in BRF113683  (5.6 months) and BRIM-3 (5.5 months). 
Supportive study(ies) 
Trametinib monotherapy 
Study MEK113583 
MEK113583 was an open-label, Phase II, multicentre study designed to evaluate the ORR following 
daily oral dosing of trametinib at a dose of 2.0 mg once daily. This study enrolled patients with BRAF 
V600E,  V600K  or  V600D  mutation-positive  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  diagnosis  of 
metastatic cutaneous melanoma. For this study patients were enrolled into two separate cohorts 
defined by prior therapy received: patients that had been previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 
and those who had not. 
Efficacy endpoint included ORR, duration of response, PFS and OS. The ORR was calculated from 
investigator assessments of tumour disease progression and response as defined by RECIST v 1.1 
(Eisenhauer, 2009). Assessments were performed at screening and every 8 weeks (± 5 days) on a 
calendar schedule and were not affected by dose interruptions/delays.  
CHMP assessment report

No confirmed CRs or PRs were observed in Cohort A, comprising patients who had received prior 
therapy with a BRAF inhibitor. The confirmed ORR in Cohort B, comprising patients who had not 
received  prior  therapy  with  a  BRAF  inhibitor,  was  25%.  The  median  PFS  in  this  cohort  was  4.0 
months, and the 6-and 12 month OS rates were 79% and 50% respectively. The OS data were not 
mature.  The median follow-up time at the data cut-off date (4 April 2013) was 13.8 months.

Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
For the combination treatment the study BRF11322220 part C was considered the pivotal study, 
whereas BRF113220 Parts B and D and results of the sub population of BRAFi-treated patients were 
considered supportive results. 
BRF113220 Part B 
For Part B of the BRF113220 study patients were enrolled in escalating dose cohorts of dabrafenib 
and trametinib in a 3+3 design. The highest 3 cohorts (150/1, 150/1.5 and 150/2) were expanded 
to  a  maximum  of  25  patients  (actual  range  22-26)  to  further  characterize  the  safety  profile  of 
combination treatment. Upon completion of dose escalation, 2 additional efficacy expansion cohorts 
were opened, one cohort enrolling patients with BRAF V600-mutation positive melanoma who had 
experienced disease progression following prior treatment with a small-molecule BRAF inhibitor and 
the other cohort enrolling patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive colorectal cancer. The 150/2 
dabrafenib/ trametinib combination therapy cohort, 24 patients were enrolled. These patients were 
BRAFi-naïve.   
For  this  cohort  a  median  investigator-assessed  PFS  of  10.8  months  (95%  CI:  5.3,  14.4)  was 
reported.  The  investigator-assessed  confirmed  ORR  was  63%  (95%  CI:  40.6,  81.2),  and  the 
median duration of response was 11.3 months (95% CI: 9.1, 16.9). 
BRF113220 Part D 
Due  to  its  improved  long-term  stability,  a  HPMC  capsule  shell  was  selected  as  the  commercial 
formulation of dabrafenib, instead of the gelatin capsule shell used in the early clinical development 
program. Because the dose escalation in Part B was conducted using gelatin capsules, Part D was 
performed to assess the impact of this change in the dabrafenib capsules shell on PK and the safety 
profile of the combination. Patients were included into four different cohorts; 75 mg BID dabrafenib 
monotherapy, 150 mg BID dabrafenib monotherapy, 75 BID dabrafenib plus 2 mg QD trametinib 
combination  therapy  and  150  BID  dabrafenib  plus  2  mg  QD  trametinb  combination  therapy.   
Efficacy  was  evaluated  in  patients  included  in  this  part  of  the  BRF113220  study  as  secondary 
endpoint. 
For the 39 BRAFi-naïve patients treated with combination 150/2 therapy in part D of BRF113220, 
the Kaplan-Meier estimate for median PFS was not reached after median follow-up of 7.7 months. 
Investigator-assessed  confirmed  response  rate  was  67%  (95%  CI:  49.8,  80.9).  At  the  time  of 
analysis,  follow-up  was  ongoing  in  77%  of  the  responding  patients  and  the  median  duration  of 
response was not reached.

BRAFi-treated patients 
The  patients  population  that  was  previously  treated  with  BRAF–inhibitors  consist  of  patients 
included  in  Part  C  of  the  BRF113220  study  who  have  been  randomized  to  the  dabrafenib 
monotherapy  arm  and  who  crossed  over  to  150/2  combination  therapy  after  progression. 
Furthermore,  in  Part  B  of  the  BRF113220  study  26  patients  were  included  who  had  previously 
treated with a BRAF inhibitor. 
For  the  43  patients  of  the  BRF113220  part  C  study,    that  crossed  over  from  dabrafeinib 
monotherapy to 150/2 combination therapy a median PFS in the crossover phase was 3.6 months 
(95% CI: 1.8, 3.9) was reported. The best confirmed ORR in the crossover phase was 9% (95 CI: 
2.6, 22.1), with 47% of the patients achieving SD and 37% having an assessment of progressive 
disease.  
For the 26 patients of the BRF113220 part B study who had been previously treated with a BRAF 
inhibitor  the  median  investigator-assessed  PFS  was  3.6  months  (95%  CI:  1.9,  5.2).    The 
investigator-assessed confirmed response rate was 15% (95% CI: 4.4, 34.9), all responses were 
partial responses.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two indications were initially sought for Mekinist (trametinib):  
1- Trametinib in combination with dabrafenib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
Part C of trial Study BRF113220 was presented as pivotal to support this combination.  
2-  Trametinib  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic 
melanoma  with  a  BRAF  V600  mutation.  Trametinib  monotherapy  has  not  demonstrated  clinical 
activity in patients who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. 
Study MEK114267 was submitted as pivotal to support the MEK inhibitor trametinib monotherapy 
for  systemic  treatment  in  stage  IIIc  or  IV  melanoma.  Although  an  open-label  study,  it  was 
implemented  under  a  Data  Management  Study  Blinding  Plan  that  outlined  procedures  for 
eliminating bias. OS analysis is considered a valuable secondary endpoint, also with respect to the 
influence of the open label status on the results on primary endpoint PFS. The open label design is 
understood since the treatment in the study arm varies intrinsically (oral versus iv use). 
Study BRF113220 was to show that trametinib in combination with BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib leads 
to  more  prolonged  PFS  in  comparison  to  BRAF  inhibition  monotherapy  (dabrafenib).  During  the 
procedure,  results  of  the  phase  III  study  MEK115306  were  submitted  to  confirm  the  results 
obtained in the BRF113220 study. 
The proposed dose of 2 mg QD was established based on better tolerability and similar efficacy of 2 
mg when compared to higher dose groups also regarding the objective tumour response.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The submitted pivotal studies, MEK114267 and BRF113220, address the issue of treatment of BRAF 
V600 mutation positive melanoma. In line with the defined signal transduction of the RAS-RAF and 
subsequently the MEK-Erk pathways the MEK inhibition with trametinib as well as the combination 
of trametinib with BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is sought. The study MEK114267 was a phase III trial 
in  which  322  patients  were  included.  Study  endpoints  as  well  as  the  assessment  of  efficacy 
parameters were acceptable. The choice of the comparator treatment in the control-arm of this 
study  MEK114267,  dacarbazine  or  paclitaxel  represented  the  options  available  for  systemic 
palliative treatment of the disease at the time of conducting the trial as no other treatment options 
(e.g. ipilimumab, vemurafenib) for melanoma were licenced at that time.  
In the clinical studies only patients with cutaneous melanoma were studied. Efficacy in patients with 
ocular or mucosal melanoma has not been assessed (SmPC section 5.1). 
MEK114267 included 322 from 1059 screened. Although approximately 50% patients are expected 
to be ineligible because of BRAF-wild type status, exclusion of an additional 20% of patients was 
considered high. These exclusions were likely to be due to stringent criteria for brain metastases 
and strict inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
BRF113220 Part C was a phase II trial that encompassed 162 patients. The study MEK115306 was 
a phase III study including 423 patients. The primary and secondary endpoints of this study, 
including PFS, OS and the RR) were considered appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There was a statistically significant improvement of the primary endpoint PFS compared with the 
comparator arm(s) in both pivotal trials. Regarding study MEK114267, the other endpoints OS, ORR 
and  DoR  are  considered  supportive  for  the  demonstration  of  better  efficacy  of  trametinib 
monotherapy compared to chemotherapy. No imbalance in post-study treatment was observed. 
In  the  MEK115306  study  the  difference  in  median  PFS  between  trametinib  in  combination  with 
dabrafenib and dabrafenib monotherapy was 0.5 month and in BRF113220 part C it was3.6 months. 
For  MEK115306  study  the  HR  for  PFS  as  assessed  by  the  investigator  was  0.75  (95%CI:  0.57, 
0.99), p=0.035 and assessed by a independent reviewer (IRC) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.04).  For 
BRF113220 part C study the HR as assessed by the investigator was HR of 0.39 (95% CI: 0.25, 
0.62; p<0.0001) and as assessed by the BIRC was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.91; p=0.0121). In terms 
of OS, the data were too immature to draw any conclusions. 
The OS analysis of the pivotal MEK114267 study is confounded by large crossover among the 108 
patients treated with chemotherapy as 70 patients (65%) crossed over to trametinib treatment. 
Trametinib monotherapy has not been compared with a BRAF inhibitor in a clinical study in patients 
with  BRAF  V600  mutation  positive  unresectable  or  metastatic  melanoma.  Based  on  cross-study 
comparisons,  overall  survival  and  progression  free  survival  data  appear  to  show  similar 
effectiveness between trametinib and BRAF inhibitors; however, overall response rates were lower 
in  patients  treated  with  trametinib  than  those  reported  in  patients  treated  with  BRAF  inhibitors 
(SmPC section 4.4). 
Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated clinical activity in patients who have progressed on 
a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy (SmPC section 4.1)

Resistance to BRAF inhibition is a known phenomenon. This acquired resistance can be explained by 
the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS or by mutations in MEK in a subpopulation of 
patients (Trunzer et al., Clin Oncol. 2013).  
The most frequent mutation is BRAFV600E, which occurs in approximately 80-95% of the 
BRAF-mutated population, whereas the BRAFV600K mutation occurs in approximately 5-20% of the 
BRAF-mutated population. The clinical phenotype in BRAF V600K-mutant melanoma appears more 
aggressive, with a shorter time from first diagnosis to metastasis and death due to a higher 
prevalence of brain and lung metastases [El-Osta, 2011]. In clinical trials, central testing for BRAF 
V600 mutation using a BRAF mutation assay was conducted on the most recent tumour sample 
available. Primary tumour or tumour from a metastatic site was tested with a validated polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) assay developed by Response Genetics Inc. The assay was specifically 
designed to differentiate between the V600E and V600K mutations.  
Subsequently, all patient samples were re-tested using the CE marked bioMerieux (bMx) THxID 
BRAF validated assay. The bMx THxID BRAF assay is an allele-specific PCR performed on DNA 
extracted from FFPE tumour tissue. The assay was designed to detect the BRAF V600E and V600K 
mutations with high sensitivity (down to 5 % V600E and V600K sequence in a background of 
wild-type sequence using DNA extracted from FFPE tissue). Non-clinical and clinical studies with 
retrospective bi-directional Sanger sequencing analyses have shown that the test also detects the 
less common BRAF V600D mutation and V600E/K601E mutation with lower sensitivity. Of the 
specimens from the non-clinical and clinical studies (n = 876) that were mutation positive by the 
THxID BRAF assay and subsequently were sequenced using the reference method, the specificity of 
the assay was 94 % (SmPC section 5.1). 
Whilst the ORR appeared to be lower in patients with tumours expressing the V600K mutation, 
efficacy in terms of PFS was similar comparing V600E and V600K. The CHMP concluded that there 
was enough evidence to support a broader indication of “V600 mutation” and not to restrict the 
indication to BRAF V600E patient population. Before taking trametinib patients must have BRAF 
V600 mutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a validated test (SmPC section 5.1). 
The appropriateness of the selected dose of trametinib 2 mg for patients with BRAF V600E mutation 
positive melanoma and the possibility of up-titration (e.g., with the V600K mutation) were 
discussed. AEs leading to dose interruptions/delay were observed in 32/70 (46%) of patients 
treated with 2 mg vs. 36/62 (58%) with 2.5 mg. More importantly 8/70 vs. 25/62, 2 and 2.5 mg, 
respectively had the dose reduced. Based on these data, up-titration of the dose cannot be 
recommended. 
The safety and efficacy of trametinib have not been evaluated in patients whose melanoma tested 
negative for the BRAF V600 mutation. 
An attempt was made to compare the efficacy of trametinib to that of other BRAF inhibitors. There 
is no clinical study directly comparing the efficacy of monotherapy trametinib with a BRAF-inhibitor, 
therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn. Based on indirect cross-study comparisons the 
effect on PFS and OS was comparable to what reported for BRAF inhibitors, however the ORR was 
notably lower. The molecular basis for this difference is not known. Objective tumour response is 
assumed to be beneficial in situations where tumour mass is associated with symptoms. The 
difference in ORR has been reflected in the SmPC (SmPC section 4.4).    
CHMP assessment report

The proportion of patients that received BRAF inhibition and Ipilimumab as post progression 
treatment was comparable for the two study groups. Also, no big differences were seen in time on 
post progression treatment (vemurafenib or ipilumumab; data not shown). The response on 
ipilimumab was not worse for patients who were earlier treated with trametinib than for patients 
treated with chemotherapy (24% versus 18%). The reported response rates for BRAF inhibition 
therapy after trametinib and after chemotherapy were comparable (CR+PR 17% versus 17; data 
not shown).  
In view of the low response rate reported with trametinib as first line, and with a BRAF inhibitor as 
second line after progression on trametinib, there might be a patient group that doesn’t respond on 
trametinib treatment and misses the opportunity to benefit from first line BRAF-inhibition. 
According to the baseline characteristics of BRF113220 study, an imbalance in percentage of 
patients having received previous chemotherapy was observed. Prior chemotherapy could imply 
comparably worse prognosis of patients at the moment next line treatment is indicated. The 150/2 
group can be considered favoured with a relatively larger group of chemotherapy-naïve patients. 
Due to the limited number of patients enrolled in study BRF113220, the baseline imbalances in prior 
treatments potentially favouring the combination, in important factors and the immature OS data, 
results of the MEK115306 study, on the combination of trametinib and dabrafenib were submitted. 
The PFS results of MEK115306 were less favourable than those observed in the phase I/II trial 
BRF113220 (HR=0.75 instead of 0.39, difference in PFS 5-10% instead of 20%) and clinical 
relevance has not robustly been established.  The efficacy results are considered borderline, at best, 
from a statistical perspective (p= 0.035, investigator and p=0.085, IRC). Furthermore, at an event 
rate of about 50% in the investigator analysis and apparent heterogeneity in activity in relation to 
prognostic factors (higher activity in patients with poor prognosis), differences might further reduce 
with longer follow-up. A clearly higher event rate is thus needed for data to be mature enough. The 
available OS data are still immature and no definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding benefit on 
OS of the combination therapy.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal and supportive trials favour the monotherapy trametinib for patients with BRAF 
mutation positive melanoma compared with chemotherapy. Cross study comparison show that the 
benefit regarding PFS and OS of trametinib monotherapy is comparable to the results previously 
reported for BRAF inhibitors, however the ORR reported for trametinib seems to be lower for 
trametinib than for vemurafenib or dabrafenib. The efficacy results of trametinib monotherapy for 
the treatment of BRAF V600 mutated malignant melanoma can be considered demonstrated. More 
importantly, trametinib monotherapy could be considered an option in patients for whom BRAF 
inhibition is not a suitable alternative. Regarding the trametinib dabrafenib combination the efficacy 
has not been established.

Overall approximately 1749 patients with cancer have been exposed to at least one administration 
of trametinib at various doses, either as monotherapy or in combination with approved drugs or 
experimental  compounds.  A  total  of  1185  subjects  received  2  mg  of  trametinib,  of  which  329 
patients had melanoma and were treated with trametinib 2 mg monotherapy once daily.  
The safety database of trametinib has been presented in 3 different populations: 
-  Integrated  trametinib  monotherapy  safety  population  (TISS):  329  patients  with  melanoma 
treated  with  trametinib  2  mg  once  daily,  of  which  211  patients  included  in  the  phase  III 
MEK114267-cross over study, 97 patients enrolled in the phase II MEK113583 study and 21 in the 
phase I MEK111054 study. Of note, data from the 68 patients enrolled in the MEK114267 study who 
had cross-over to trametinib at the time of the cut-off for the MEK114267 study were not included 
in the TISS. 
- Population enrolled in the phase III MEK114267 study: 310 patients with metastatic melanoma, of 
which 211 patients treated with trametinib 2 mg once daily 99 patients treated with chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel or dacarbazine at discretion of the investigator). 
- OCEANS: SAEs from patients enrolled in the trametinib clinical program are provided from the 
GSK Global safety database, referred to as OCEANS.  
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
For  the  combination  treatment  Trametinib-Dabrafenib,  safety  data  from  study  BRF113220  are 
presented in comparison with updated safety data from the TISS for trametinib (uTISS, data cut-off 
date 23 June 2012) and dabrafenib (DISS, data cut-off date 25 June 2012). Safety data from 6 
groups  of  patients  with  unresectable  or  metastatic  BRAFV600-mutation  positive  melanoma  are 
evaluated as follows: 
- Part C 150/2 population (primary safety population): the 55 patients treated with dabrafenib 150 
mg BID and trametinib 2 mg QD in Part C of Study BRF113220. 
- Pooled 150/2 population: the 202 patients treated with dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 2 
mg  QD  in  Parts  B,  C,  and  D  of  Study  BRF113220,  including  patients  who  initially  received 
monotherapy and crossed over to receive 150/2 combination therapy (only safety data collected 
during combination treatment are included). 
- Trametinib Integrated Summary of Safety population (uTISS): updated safety data (cut-off date 
23  June  2012)  from  the  329  subjects  in  the  TISS,  who  received  trametinib  2  mg  QD  as 
monotherapy. 
- Dabrafenib Integrated Summary of Safety population (DISS): updated safety data (cut-off date 
25  June  2012)  from  the  586  patients  who  received  dabrafenib  150  mg  BID  as  monotherapy, 
originally included in the original submission for MAA (ongoing procedure). 
- Part C Dabrafenib Monotherapy treatment group: the 53 patients treated with dabrafenib 150 mg 
BID as monotherapy in Part C of Study BRF113220.  
- Pooled Any Combination Dose population (PACDP): includes all 365 patients who received at least 
one dose of the combination regimen irrespective of the specific dabrafenib or trametinib dose in 
parts B, C, and D of Study BRF113220. Part A was not included because patients were not allowed 
to receive combination treatment until the combination dose was determined in Part B.

Furthermore, a comparison of the safety of HPMC and gelatin based dabrafenib combination 
regimens is provided. 
During the procedure, the Applicant provided a safety update regarding the above mentioned safety 
populations. Essentially, the updated data are in line with the data presented during the original 
submission. 
Moreover, according to the Applicant Phase III studies MEK115306 and MEK116513, further 
investigating the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, are currently ongoing. 
Table 33: Safety Populations 
Patient exposure 
Trametinib monotherapy 
At the data cut-off date, 107 patients (33%) in the TISS were treated with trametinib for more than 
6 months. Median duration of treatment was longer in the trametinib arm of the pivotal MEK114267 
study (4.83 months) and the TISS (3.84 months) compared with the chemotherapy arm (2.07 
months). The mean daily dose was 1.85 mg (93% of the targeted 2 mg dose) in the TISS and 1.81 
mg (or 91%) in the trametinib arm of the MEK114267 study. 
In the MEK114267 study and in the TISS a similar frequency of dose reductions (32% and 29%, 
respectively) and dose delay/interruptions (41% and 44%, respectively) were reported, and the 
frequency was significantly higher than frequencies observed in the chemotherapy arm of the 
pivotal MEK114267 study (11% and 27%, respectively). The most frequent reasons for dose 
modifications were AEs (>80%). In the trametinib arm of the MEK114267 study and in the TISS 
7-9% of patients required 2 dose reductions or delay/interruptions, versus 1-5% of patients treated 
with chemotherapy in the pivotal study. Dose re-escalations were implemented in 11 patients (4%) 
in the TISS.

Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
At the time of the data cut-off for Part C of Study BRF113220 (31 May 2012), most patients in the 
Part C 150/2 treatment group (74%) were still ongoing in the study (on treatment, in the cross-over 
phase or in follow-up). The proportion of patients still on treatment was higher in the Part C 150/2 
group (43%) compared with the Part C dabrafenib monotherapy group (30%), the Pooled 150/2 
population (36%) and the PACDP (39%). Discontinuation due to AEs was more common in the Part 
C 150/2 group (13%) compared with the Part C Dabrafenib Monotherapy group (2%). Similar low 
percentages of discontinuation due to AEs were reported in the pooled 150/2 population and in the 
PACDP (7%). As of the data cut-off, 93% and 73% of patients had discontinued study treatment in 
the  uTISS  and  DISS,  respectively,  with  disease  progression  being  the  most  frequent  reason  for 
discontinuation. 
Median daily dose of dabrafenib was 281.75 mg in the Part C 150/2 group, 295.91 mg in the Part C 
Dabrafenib monotherapy group, and 285.58 mg in the Pooled 150/2 population. The median daily 
dose  of  trametinib  was  1.92  mg  in  the  Part  C  150/2  group,  and  1.95  mg  in  the  Pooled  150/2 
population. 
The median time on study treatment was longer in Part C 150/2 group (10.9 months for both 
dabrafenib and trametinib) compared with the uTISS (3.84 months), and the DISS (5.47 months). 
Of note, the median time of therapy in the Part C 150/2 group was also longer than the Pooled 
150/2 Population (6.5 months), essentially due to shorter follow up achieved by several subgroups 
included in the pooled population (Part C crossover, Part D, BRAF-I pre-treated patients) at the time 
of the analysis. 
Additional safety data for the combination treatment were obtained by the phase III MEK115306 
study. The safety population of MEK115306 included 420 patients; 209 patients were treated with 
dabrafenib and trametinib in combination and 211 patients were treated with dabrafenib 
monotherapy. 
Adverse events 
Trametinib monotherapy 
Adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA v14.1 in MEK111054 and v15.0 in the MEK113583 
and MEK114267 studies, and graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria 
(version 3.0 [MEK111054 and MEK113583] and version 4.0 [MEK114267]).

The most common AEs in subjects treated with trametinib in the integrated studies included rash, 
diarrhea,  fatigue,  edema  peripheral,  nausea,  dermatitis  acneiform  and  vomitting.    Among  the 
common  AEs  in  MEK114267,  rash,  diarrhea,  edema  peripheral,  dermatitis  acneiform,  dry  skin, 
pruritis,  paronychia  and  hypertension  were  more  frequent  in  the  trametinib  arm,  while  nausea, 
vomiting and constipation were more frequent in the chemotherapy arm.  
Most AEs in the TISS and trametinib arm of the MEK114267 study were Grade 1 or 2. The most 
common Grade 3 AEs were hypertension and rash. Five subjects in the TISS had Grade 5 AEs (1 
gastrointestinal fistula, 1 hepatic and renal failure; 1 myocardial infarction; 1 renal failure; 1 death 
due to unknown causes). 
The majority of AEs in the chemotherapy arm of the pivotal MEK114267 study were Grades 1 and 
2. The most common Grade 3 AEs were fatigue and hypertension; two fatal SAEs were reported 
(pneumonia, pseudomembranous colitis).

Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
The overall AE profile was similar between the Part C 150/2 and the Pooled 150/2 population, and 
between the DISS and the Part C Dabrafenib monotherapy arm.

Table 39: Adverse Events Experienced by ≥10% of Subjects in Part C 150/2 Group (All Treated or 
Safety Population) 
In the Part C 150/2 population, pyrexia, neutropenia and back pain were the most common Grade 
3 AEs (5% each), and neutropenia (5%) was the most common Grade 4 AE, all observed at higher 
incidence compared with uTISS and DISS. However, grade 3 hypertension (2%) and grade 3 rash 
(0%) occurred at lower frequency compared to the uTISS (9% and 7%, respectively), as well as 
grade 3 SCC (4%) and hypophosphatemia (0%) compared with the DISS (7% and 4%, 
respectively). 
Headline safety results show that the adverse event profile observed for the trametinib/dabrafenib 
combination in MEK115306 is consistent with that reported in BRF113220. With a few minor 
exceptions, overall AE, grade 3-4 SAE and fatal SAE rates in the MEK115306 were numerically lower 
than, or similar to, the rates reported in BRF113220 part C or previously pooled safety data from the 
combination treatment.

Pyrexia remains the most common adverse event in patients receiving trametinib plus dabrafenib 
combination therapy. Other common AEs in patients receiving combination therapy included fatigue, 
nausea, headache, and chills. No disturbing different frequencies of adverse events or the 
observation of unknown adverse events were reported in the MEK115306, as were already known 
for the combination treatment.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Consistent with the expected pharmacology, preclinical toxicology profile and the mechanism of 
action of trametinib (MEK inhibition), dabrafenib (BRAF inhibition) and the population treated, AEs 
of special interest (AESI) related to trametinib are rash and other skin-related toxicities, diarrhoea, 
ocular  events,  cardiac-related  events  and  QT  prolongation,  hypertension,  hepatic  events, 
pneumonitis, and oedema. AESI related to dabrafenib are pyrexia, cutaneous SCC (cuSCC), other 
treatment emergent malignancies including new malignant melanoma, uveitis, PPES, renal failure 
and pancreatitis.  
In general the incidence of AESI in the trametinib arm of study MEK114267 was similar to the TISS 
and  higher  when  compared  to  the  chemotherapy  arm.  Of  relevance,  MEK-related  skin-related 
toxicities, diarrhoea and hypertension appeared to be lower with the combination treatment (Part C 
150/2 group of BRF 113220 study) compared with trametinib monotherapy (TISS), whereas the 
rate of ocular events was higher. 
BRAF-related  events  of  pyrexia  and  renal  failure  appeared  to  be  higher  with  the  combination 
treatment  (Part  C  150/2  group)  compared  with  dabrafenib  monotherapy  (DISS),  whereas  the 
incidence of cuSCC and PPE events was lower. The observed reduction of several AEs (including 
rash and diarrhoea) in patients treated with the combination trametinib-dabrafenib compared with 
what it would have been expected when the drug is given as dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy 
has been theoretically explained by inhibition (achieved by combination treatments) of paradoxical 
activation of RAF or MEK –MAP kinase pathways induced by single selective inhibition of BRAF or 
MEK.  
Specific guidelines have been developed by the Applicant and implemented in the studies 
performed for prevention, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of AESI.

Skin-related events were observed in 88% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy 
compared with 14% of patients treated with chemotherapy in the MEK114267 study, 65% of 
patients treated with the combination trametinib-dabrafenib in Part C of the BRF113220 study and 
45% of patients treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. They essentially consisted of rash (58% 
[grade 3/4: 7%/<1%] in TISS vs 27% [grade 3/4:0/0] in Part C 150/2) and dermatitis acneiform 
(22% [grade 3/4:2%/0%] in TISS vs 16%[grade 3/4:0/0] in Part C 150/2). They generally 
occurred within the first months of treatment; most cases were grade 1 or 2 severity and did not 
require any dose interruptions or dose reductions. Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) was 
observed in 4% (grade 3/4:0/0) of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy, versus no 
patients treated with chemotherapy, 7% (grade 3/4:0/0) of patients treated with the combination 
trametinib-dabrafenib and 17% (grade 3/4:0/0) of patients treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. 
The incidence of cutaneous SCC and keratoacanthoma (typical AEs related to BRAF inhibition) 
appears to be reduced in the combination therapy population (Part C 150/2: 7%) compared with 
the dabrafenib monotherapy population (DISS: 11%; Part C Dabrafenib monotherapy: 19%) 
whereas no cases were observed in patients treated with trametinib monotherapy. Median time to 
onset appears to be delayed in the combination group (152 days) compared with the dabrafenib 
monotherapy population (DISS: 63 days). No new primary melanoma were reported with the 
dabrafenib-trametinib combination therapy and in 1% of patients treated with the dabrafenib 
monotherapy population. Other new primary malignancies were sporadically seen in patients 
treated with dabrafenib ± trametinib (≤1%), but no specific pattern of development of new 
malignancies could be identified. Theoretically, reactivation of a previous cancer could be 
hypothesized, especially when harbouring a mutated RAS oncogene. 
Pyrexia and pyrexia-related events (including influenza like symptoms, cytokine release 
syndrome and systemic inflammatory response syndrome) were the most frequently reported AEs 
observed with the combination therapy (71 % [39/55] of patients in BRF133220 and 51 % 
[107/209] of patients in MEK115306). The incidence and severity in the combination therapy was 
higher than with dabrafenib (DISS: 33%, grade 3/4: 2%/<1%) and trametinib (uTISS: 15%, grade 
3/4:<1%/0) monotherapy. This is reflected also in the higher use of antipyretics (40%), NSAIDs 
(40%) and corticosteroids (25%, recommended as prophylaxis for recurrent [≥1] episodes) in 
patients receiving combination treatment compared to dabrafenib or trametinib monotherapy. The 
median time to onset was 30 days (2-330) with potential relation with dabrafenib dose and median 
duration of 7.5 days (1-435). Approximately 33% of patients treated with combination therapy 
experienced ≥3 occurrences of pyrexia with higher incidence of hospitalization (11%) compared 
with dabrafenib monotherapy, essentially due to associated hypotension (~10%), hyponatraemia 
(~10%) and renal failure (3%), usually responsive to fluid and salt repletion. Approximately 50% of 
patients required dose reductions and interruptions (57%), compared with 15% and 30%, 
respectively in the DISS, whereas pyrexia led to treatment withdrawn in 5% of cases (compared 
with none in the DISS).

Ocular events were observed in 13% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy (essentially 
blurred vision [6%] and dry eye [3%]) and led to dose interruptions and reductions in 12% and 7% 
of cases, respectively. The majority of ocular AEs were grade 1/2, with grade 3/4 events observed 
only in ≤1% of patients. Retinal vein occlusion (RVO), potentially due to prolonged inhibition of the 
MAP-kinase signal transduction pathway leading to impairment of the blood retinal barrier and 
activation of the coagulation cascade, was observed in <1% of patients treated with trametinib as 
monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, whereas no cases were observed in patients 
treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. In all cases the RVO occurred in only one eye, after 
prolonged (at least 12 weeks) treatment, and in presence of predisposing factors (e.g., glaucoma, 
hypertension, elevated hematocrit, chronic non-ischemic vein occlusion) in the majority of cases. 
RVO events resulted in discontinuation of study treatment in all patients. There is a comparative low 
incidence of RVO as AE in reaction to the use of trametinib, the comparatively high rate of risk 
factors for RVO in the general population (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, OAC, 
glaucoma, and/or anti-phospholipid syndrome) in relation to the severity of the disease 
(metastasized melanoma) to be treated. Local treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF 
antibodies was given in few patients with improvement of visual acuity. RPED was observed in <1% 
of patients treated with trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib, versus no 
cases observed in patients treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. All AEs were bilateral, 
self-limiting, did not require therapy or even not required stopping treatment in case of grade 1 
events, did not result in any long-term visual impairment and re-treatment with trametinib was 
successful in the majority of cases. In the most cases CSR occurred within the first or second week 
of treatment, with no clear dose- or exposure- relationship, and resolved within 2 weeks from 
diagnosis. Of note, trametinib-induced CSR appears to be different when compared with 
literature-reported data as all cases were bilateral, without gender differences and appear to 
resolve much faster. Papilledema and optic nerve edema were reported in ≤1% of patients treated 
with trametinib monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. The event was not always 
associated with presence of brain metastases or increased intracranial pressure and in one case 
improving was reported after trametinib discontinuation. Uveitis events (including iritis) were 
reported in 1% of patients treated with dabrafenib monotherapy and in 2% of patients treated with 
the combination trametinib-dabrafenib, whereas no cases were observed in patients treated with 
trametinib monotherapy. The median time to onset was 9 weeks and median time to resolution was 
19 days with topical anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids) ophthalmic therapy. 
None of the events was serious and permanent discontinuation of treatment was not required in any 
patient. Of note, uveitis events in patients treated with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib were 
frequently associated or anticipated by episodes of fever, and were characterized by longer median 
time to resolution and increased severity (grade 3 and 4 events were reported) compared with the 
events observed with dabrafenib monotherapy. 
Diarrhoea was more frequently reported with trametinib monotherapy (49%) compared with the 
combination dabrafenib-trametinib (36%) and dabrafenib monotherapy (16%), with occurrence 
within the first 14 days of treatment. In all populations treated, most cases (98%) were grade 1 or 
2 severity, with only 2% grade 3 and no grade 4 nor SAEs. Dose adjustments were required in 4% 
of patients, whereas no treatment discontinuation was reported.

Cardiac related events, including reduction of ejection fraction and left ventricular dysfunction, 
were observed in 9% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy or with the combination 
trametinib-dabrafenib, compared with 2% of patients treated with dabrafenib monotherapy. 
Therefore, addition of dabrafenib to trametinib did not appear to worsen the cardiac-related AEs in 
terms of incidence and severity. Most of events remain asymptomatic, essentially due to early 
detection and treatment interruption. The majority of cases observed in patients treated with 
trametinib monotherapy were grade 1 or 2 events (76-76%); grade 3 events were reported in 2% 
of all patients treated (25-26% of the cardiac events) and no grade 4 events were observed. Median 
time of onset ranged between 58 and 84 days. Dose interruption due to cardiac-related events 
occurred in 58-75% of trametinib monotherapy treated patients, whereas dose reductions and 
treatment withdrawal were reported in 35-55% and <2 % of cases, respectively. About 10% of 
patients treated with trametinib monotherapy reported clinically meaningful reductions in LVEF 
(≥10% decrease in LVEF from baseline and below lower limit of normal [LLN]) leading to treatment 
interruption. Time to the nadir ranged from 28 to 526 days. In the majority of patients re-challenge 
was performed and was successful, whereas 16% of patients were withdrawn from study due to 
cardiac-related events.  
Peripheral oedema was reported in around 40% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy 
compared with 5% of patients treated with chemotherapy. Median time to onset was 43 days and 
median duration of the event was 42 days. In about 50% of cases oedema was associated with left 
ventricular dysfunction. Oedema AEs led to dose interruption in 6% of patients, to dose reduction in 
1-2% of patients, and to treatment discontinuation in 2% of patients.  
Hypertension was reported in 9% of patients treated with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib 
in the Part C 150/2 group, compared with 15% in the trametinib monotherapy population and 2% 
in the dabrafenib monotherapy population. Most of cases were Grade 1 or 2, 2% were Grade 3 and 
no Grade 4 or 5 were observed. There were no SAEs or discontinuations of study drug due to 
hypertension in any of the patients treated with the combination trametinib-dabrafenib. In patients 
treated with trametinib monotherapy dose reductions or interruptions due to hypertension were 
reported in ≤1% of cases. 
Hepatic events were reported in around 12% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy. 
Increased ALT (9%) and AST (10%) were the most frequently reported hepatic AEs, mostly of 
Grade 1 or 2 (72%), with median time to onset of 29 days and median duration of 33 days. No Hy’s 
Law cases were identified. Dose modification or treatment withdrawal was reported in 2-4% of 
cases. The incidence of hepatic events was similar between patients treated with trametinib 
monotherapy and the combination trametinib-dabrafenib. 
Renal failure was reported in 7% (4 patients) of patients treated with dabrafenib in combination 
with trametinib in the Part C 150/2 of study BRF113220, compared with <1% with dabrafenib 
monotherapy (DISS) and 2% with trametinib monotherapy (TISS). All events were Grade 3 
severity, 50% of cases were considered SAEs and drug-related. Renal failure AEs were associated 
with pyrexia or diarrhoea in the majority of cases, where dehydration could be a contributing factor.

Pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease (ILD): In study MEK114267, 2 % (5/211) of 
patients treated with trametinib monotherapy developed ILD or pneumonitis; all five patients 
required hospitalisation. The median time to first presentation of ILD or pneumonitis was 160 days 
(range: 60 to 172 days). In MEK115306, < 1 % (1/209) of patients treated with trametinib in 
combination with dabrafenib developed pneumonitis requiring hospitalisation. ILD was reported in 
<1% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy, compared with no case in patients treated 
with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib or dabrafenib monotherapy. All events were serious 
and considered by the investigator to be possibly drug-related. In all cases, the event was reported 
as improving or resolved upon interruption of trametinib treatment and initiation of symptomatic 
therapy. 
The incidence of pancreatitis was <1% in the patients treated with dabrafenib or trametinib 
monotherapy, and 1% in patients treated with the dabrafenib-trametinib combination. 
Discontinuation of study drug was not considered necessary in any case.  
The incidences of QTc ≥501 msec and of QTc increase of > 60 msec from baseline were significantly 
higher with the combination dabrafenib-trametinib (4% and 13%, respectively) compared with the 
trametinib (2% and 3%, respectively) and the dabrafenib (<1% and 3%, respectively) 
monotherapy populations. Grade 3 QTc (≥501 msec) concomitantly with >60 msec from baseline 
were reported as sporadic events (1%). The data presented suggests a marginal clinical relevance 
of the observed QT prolongation events in patients treated with trametinib monotherapy.  
Haemorrhagic events: In the primary dataset, one event in each of the categories brain stem 
haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, haemorrhage intracranial, gastric haemorrhage and 
haemoptysis was noted in the BRF113220 part C combination therapy population. In contrast, no 
bleeding SAEs are reported in the part C dabrafenib monotherapy population. All but one of the 9 
fatal events in BRF113220 was considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. However, 
upon review of the brief narratives, 2 additional cases concerning intracranial haemorrhage may 
well be suspected as related to study drug. An updated analysis listed 2 additional SAEs of GI 
haemorrhage (1 grade 3 and 1 grade 4), and 1 intracranial haemorrhage leading to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug, reported in BRF113220 randomised part C. In MEK114267, 2 
additional SAEs of haemoptysis and 1 of haematoma were reported. 
Rhabdomyolysis: there have been 5 documented cases of rhabdomyolysis (one grade 2 and four 
grade 3). Three of these occurred with trametinib monotherapy (1.4%) compared to no cases in the 
chemotherapy group in MEK114267. In one of these cases, rhabdomyolysis recurred on re-starting 
trametinib. The other two cases occurred in patients who received trametinib in combination with 
dabrafenib. In all 5 cases rhabdomyolysis was judged as being related to trametinib or combination 
treatment. In three of the cases treatment with trametinib had to be interrupted.

SAEs were reported in 22% of patients in the TISS and 24% of the patients in the trametinib arm of 
MEK114267 study, whereas SAEs in the chemotherapy arm were reported in 20% of subjects. 
Cellulitis was the most frequent SAE in the TISS followed by pulmonary embolism, anaemia, 
dyspnoea, pneumonitis, vomiting, dehydration and erysipelas. Pyrexia, cholecystitis, and anaemia 
were the most common SAEs in subjects treated with chemotherapy. SAEs that were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study drug occurred in 33 patients (10%) in the TISS, in 26 
subjects (12%) in the MEK114267 trametinib arm and in 11 subjects (11%) in the chemotherapy 
arm.  
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
In addition to the standard definition of SAEs, the BRF113220 study protocol mandated that the 
following events were to be reported as SAEs, regardless of whether the patients were hospitalised: 
SCC; LVEF decreases meeting protocol-defined stopping criteria; CSR or RVO, valvular toxicity 
meeting protocol-defined stopping criteria; new primary cancers; and pyrexia accompanied by 
hypotension and/or rigors/chills. The reported incidence of SAEs was significantly higher in the Part 
C 150/2 combination group (62%) compared to the uTISS (22%) and DISS (30%), this difference 
might be partly explained by the differences in SAE criteria used for the different safety 
populations.. The overall SAE profile of the combination trametinib-dabrafenib was consistent in the 
Part C 150/2 and the Pooled 150/2 populations, as well as in the DISS and the Part C dabrafenib 
monotherapy populations. In the Part C 150/2 combination group, pyrexia (25%) and chills (18%) 
were the most commonly reported AEs (mostly considered drug related), followed by dehydration, 
Ejection Fraction decreased, SCC, pulmonary embolism and renal failure (4% each). 
In the MEK115306 study overall, 35% of patients in the combination arm reported SAEs. The most 
common AEs reported were pyrexia (15%) and chills (4%). 
Deaths 
Trametinib monotherapy 
At the data cut-off date of study MEK114267, 84 patients (40%) in the trametinib arm had died 
compared with 50 patients (50%) in the chemotherapy arm. Of note, 31 patients enrolled in the 
chemotherapy arm died following crossover to trametinib, mostly due to disease progression. 
At the data cut-off date for the TISS, 157 subjects (48%) treated with trametinib had died, of which 
37 (11%) within 28 days after last dose of study treatment. Disease progression was the reason for 
death in 147 of the 157 cases. A total of 5 patients in the TISS died due to 6 fatal SAEs (1 
gastrointestinal fistula, 1 myocardial infarction, 1 renal failure, 1 hepatic and renal failure, 1 
infected skin ulcer, 1 death not otherwise specified), compared with 2 patients treated with 
chemotherapy in the MEK114267 study (pneumonia and pseudomembranous colitis). All except 
one of the fatal SAEs (renal failure in Subject 402007) were considered not drug-related. The fatal 
SAE in MEK113583 (gastrointestinal fistula) was reported as a post-therapy fatal SAE. One fatal 
SAE was reported in the Crossover Population of study MEK114267 and was not considered 
drug-related. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 111/132 
 
  
  
By analysis of all fatal SAEs across the trametinib program (including 1486 patients) using 26 
September 2012 as cut-off date, 74 fatal SAEs have been reported, of which 63 considered 
not-related to study drug and with cause of death consistent with what observed in patients with 
metastatic cancer and late stage AML. Of the 11 fatal SAEs considered drug-related, one was 
reported in the chemotherapy arm of a randomized phase II study.  In 5 of the remaining 10 cases, 
a cardiac etiology related to trametinib cannot be excluded. In other 3 cases, interstitial lung 
disease or pneumonitis were reported as fatal SAEs, two of which observed in patients treated with 
trametinib in combination with gemcitabine. Moreover, based on a preliminary review, 9 cases of 
sudden death or cardiac arrest related to study drug were identified.  
Finally, additional cases of fatal SAEs were reported in the ongoing phase II study MEK114653, 
comparing trametinib versus docetaxel in patients with NSCLC, a trial that has been early stopped 
following recommendation of the internal safety review committee due to lack of efficacy associated 
to unfavourable toxicity associated with trametinib, essentially due to the higher rate of fatal SAEs 
observed in the trametinib arm (8 patients) versus none in the docetaxel arm. However, only in one 
of such cases death was considered possibly related to trametinib. Of note incidence of specific 
SAEs reported in study MEK114653 (pneumonia and dyspnoea) was higher than observed in the 
TISS.  
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
The incidences of death events and deaths ≤ 28 days after last dose of study drug were higher in 
the uTISS (48% and 11%, respectively) and DISS (47% and 15%) compared to Part C 150/2 (33% 
and 4%) and Pooled 150/2 (25% and 9%) populations. In the great majority of cases death was 
related to underlying disease; incidence of death due to SAE possibly related to study treatment 
was low (≤2%) and similar in all treatment arms. Nine patients in study BRF113220 reported fatal 
SAEs, all considered not related to study drug with the exception of a case of ventricular 
arrhythmia, where relation with study medication could not be excluded. 
In the MEK115306 study four fatal SAEs (2%) were reported for the trametinib/dabrafenib 
combination treatment. None of these events were deemed related to the study therapy by the 
investigator. No fatal events were reported in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. 
Laboratory findings 
Trametinib monotherapy 
In general frequency of haematological and biochemical abnormalities was very similar between the 
TISS and the trametinib arm of study MEK114267. In the TISS the most commonly observed 
haematological abnormalities were: haemoglobin decreased (40%, 4% grade ≥3), platelet count 
decreased (19%, <1% grade ≥3), neutrophil count decreased (14%, 0% grade ≥3). Similar 
percentages were observed in the trametinib arm of MEK114267 study and were different 
compared to the chemotherapy arm (anaemia 27%, 3% grade ≥3; neutrophil count decreased 
23%, 5% grade ≥3; platelet count decreased 21%, 2% grade ≥3).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 112/132 
 
  
  
The most common (>40% patients overall) biochemical abnormalities were AST increase (63%, 
4% grade ≥3 in the TISS and trametinib arm of MEK114267 study versus 16%, 1% grade ≥3 in the 
chemotherapy arm of study MEK114267), ALT increase (36%, 3% grade ≥3 versus 20%, 3% grade 
≥3, respectively), hypoalbuminemia (53%, 4% grade ≥3 versus 24%, 1% grade ≥3, respectively), 
hyperglycaemia (50%, 2% grade ≥3 versus 51%, 1% grade ≥3, respectively), and hypoglycaemia 
(13%, <1% grade ≥3 versus 3%, 0% grade ≥3, respectively).  
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
The combination of trametinib with dabrafenib in the Part C 150/2 of the BRF113220 study resulted 
in an increased incidence of haematological and biochemical abnormalities. In particular, an 
increased incidence of anaemia (55%, Grade 3/4: 4%/0), lymphocytopenia (55%, Grade 3/4: 
16%/5%), neutrophil count decreased (55%, Grade 3/4: 7%/5%), platelet count decreased (31%, 
Grade 3/4: 2%/2%) were observed compared with the updated Trametinib ISS (uTISS, anaemia 
[40%, Grade 3/4: 4%/0], lymphocytopenia [15%, Grade 3/4: 3%/<1%], neutrophil count 
decreased [14%, Grade 3/4: 0/0], platelet count decreased [19%, Grade 3/4: 0/<1%]), and the 
Dabrafenib ISS (DISS, anaemia [31%, Grade 3/4: 2%/0], lymphocytopenia [25%, Grade 3/4: 
7%/<1%], neutrophil count decreased [13%, Grade 3/4: <1%/<1%], platelet count decreased 
[8%, Grade 3/4: <1%/<1%]) populations.  
Regarding biochemical abnormalities, in the all population treated with combination 
trametinib-dabrafenib (365 pts) an increased incidence of hyponatraemia (48%, Grade 3/4: 
11%/<1%), potassium abnormalities and increased alkaline phosphatase (60%, Grade 3/4: 5%/0) 
was observed compared with uTISS and DISS populations, with hyperglycaemia, ALT/AST increase, 
hyperglycaemia, phosphorus abnormalities and hypomagnesaemia being also frequently observed. 
Safety in special populations 
No studies in paediatric populations have been completed to date with trametinib as monotherapy 
or in combination with dabrafenib, therefore no data on safety of trametinib and dabrafenib in 
paediatric patients are available. No data are available on the safety of the drugs in pregnant 
women. No analyses were conducted by race, as all patients enrolled in the studies were classified 
as white (100%). The lack/paucity of data in paediatric patients, pregnant women, races other than 
White and patients ≥ 75 years old are reflected in the SmPC. 
Hepatic impairment 
All studies performed with trametinib allowed inclusion of patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN, ASAT/ALAT ≤2.5 or 5x ULN). In the 64 patients (13%) included in the 
population PK analysis, CL/F of trametinib was only 2% altered, a value which is not considered 
clinically relevant. The Applicant has provided data regarding the toxicity of trametinib, alone or in 
combination with dabrafenib, in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared with patients with 
normal liver function.  
Regarding the toxicity of trametinib when given as monotherapy in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment, an increased incidence (>10%) of fatigue, dyspnoea and AST increased was observed 
compared with patients with normal liver function. However, the incidence of serious adverse 
events, withdrawal from study treatment due to AE, and dose reductions was similar between the 
two groups evaluated.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 113/132 
 
  
  
Regarding the toxicity of trametinib when given in combination with dabrafenib, events like nausea, 
vomiting, oropharyngeal pain, urinary tract infection, rash-generalized, and muscular weakness as 
well as serious AEs in general were more frequently (>10%) reported in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment compared with subject with normal hepatic function. However, other events including 
pyrexia, chills, arthralgia, diarrhoea, rash, cough, visual disorders and night sweats, as well 
withdrawal due to AEs, occurred more often in normal hepatic function patients compared to mild 
hepatic impaired patients. Frequency of rash and of AEs leading to dose reductions was similar 
between the two sub-population. 
Renal impairment 
An analysis of Adverse Events differentiated by patients with normal or impaired renal function has 
been performed. With the exception of few adverse events, including peripheral oedema, 
constipation, alopecia, pruritis, abdominal pain, pain in extremity and erythema, which were more 
frequently observed in patients with moderate renal impairment compared with mild or normal 
renal function, the toxicity of trametinib appears similar. Moreover, the limited number of patients 
with moderate renal impairment treated with trametinib (27 subjects) in the study performed to 
date, limits the reliability of the above mentioned findings. Therefore, no firm conclusions can be 
drawn on side effects of Mekinist in subjects with GFR < 60 ml/m.  
The PK data available confirms no significant effect of renal impairment on the PK and safety of 
trametinib.  
Age 
Trametinib monotherapy 
In the TISS, the majority of patients (76% [249]) were aged <65 years at baseline; 24% [80 pts] 
were ≥65 years, of which 16% [13 pts] were ≥75 years. Some events (e.g., rash [60% vs 51%], 
fatigue [36% vs 25%], nausea [32% vs 25%], dermatitis acneiform [24% vs 19%], vomiting [22% 
vs 14%], dry skin [18% vs 14%], abdominal pain [14% vs 11%], headache [14% vs 5%]) appear 
to be more frequently reported in patients <65 years, whereas other events (e.g., oedema 
peripheral [30% vs 44%], constipation [17% vs 23%], decreased appetite [12% vs 15%], pain in 
extremity [6% vs 11%]) were more frequently observed in among subjects ≥65 years. However, 
incidence of AEs, SAEs, and drug-related AEs was similar between the two study arms. A lower 
proportion of subjects aged <65 years had AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug, 
dose reduction and dose interruption. Subjects aged >75 years had higher proportions of all types 
of AEs compared with the other age groups. However, they represent a small subgroup of the 
population treated (13 patients).  
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 114/132 
 
  
  
In the Pooled 150/2 population, 160 patients were < 65 years whereas 42 patients were ≥65 years, 
of which 19 patients were ≥75 year old. Overall, incidence of drug-related AEs (90% vs 95%), SAEs 
(36% vs 48%), AEs leading to permanent discontinuation (7% vs 14%), dose reduction (44% vs 
64%) or interruption (60% vs 71%), fatal SAEs (1% vs 12%), as well as specific AEs like fatigue 
(34% vs 52%), diarrhoea (26% vs 31%), oedema peripheral (16% vs 33%), constipation (15% vs 
33%), dry skin (9% vs 19%), and anaemia (15% vs 24%) were more frequently reported in 
patients ≥65 years. In contrast, in patients < 65 years an increased incidence of rash (29% vs 
19%), arthralgia (29% vs 21%), and headache (28% vs 24%) was observed. Of note, overall the 
frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 AEs were similar in the two age groups, but the incidence of Grade 3 
or 4 SCC was higher in the ≥65 year old group (1% vs10%). 
Gender 
According to the data provided, a trend versus a slight increase of specific AEs could be observed in 
females compared to males treated with trametinib or the combination trametinib-dabrafenib, 
which could be partly justified by the difference in trametinib exposure observed by gender and 
weight. In the TISS, incidence of SAEs was higher in females than males (14% vs 8%, 
respectively), and frequency of several AEs (e.g. diarrhoea [56% vs 44%], oedema peripheral 
[39% vs 29%], nausea [34% vs 28%], vomiting [26% vs 16%], constipation [21% vs 17%], dry 
skin [21% vs 15%], pruritus, abdominal pain [18% vs 10%], headache [15% vs 9%]) was higher 
in female. However, other AEs (e.g., rash, fatigue, dermatitis acneiform) were more frequently 
reported in males.   
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug-drug interaction study has been performed with trametinib. As trametinib is 
metabolized predominantly via hydrolytic enzymes, its pharmacokinetics is unlikely to be affected 
by drug-drug interactions. Moreover, based on in vitro and in vivo data, interaction via CYP 
enzymes and transporters is unlikely. Trametinib has been given in combination with other 
compounds (e.g., gemcitabine, dabrafenib) in several clinical studies but, with the exceptions of the 
combination with dabrafenib, no other data are available regarding the safety of the drug in other 
combinations. A relevant PK interaction has been observed when trametinib was administered with 
food, therefore administration of the drug in fasted condition is currently recommended. 
Clinically relevant PK-PD interactions via induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 
3A4-mediated metabolism and of other enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 
mediated by dabrafenib have been demonstrated. Therefore co-administration of dabrafenib with 
compounds metabolized by such enzymes (e.g., hormonal contraceptives, warfarin, 
dexamethasone) should be avoided. Moreover, as dabrafenib is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 
and CYP3A4 strong inhibitors or inducers of such enzymes should be avoided. 
Administration of dabrafenib and trametinib in combination had no clinically relevant effect on the 
exposure of trametinib or of dabrafenib monotherapy.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Trametinib monotherapy  
Overall, 10% of subjects in the TISS, and 12% and 9% of subjects in the trametinib and 
chemotherapy arms of study MEK114267, respectively, had AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug. Each AE leading to permanent discontinuation of trametinib 
monotherapy occurred in 2 or fewer subjects with the exception of pneumonitis (4 cases in both the 
trametinib arm of MEK114267 and the TISS), and ALT increased (3 cases in the trametinib arm of 
MEK114267). Flushing and peripheral sensory neuropathy led to discontinuation in 2% of subjects 
in the chemotherapy arm of MEK114267 versus none in the trametinib arm. Several patients had 
also AEs related to LVEF decreases that met the protocol-mandated study drug stopping criteria. 
The proportion of patients reporting AEs leading to dose reductions and AEs leading to dose 
delays/interruptions was similar in the TISS (26% and 36%, respectively) and in the trametinib arm 
of study MEK114267 (32% and 38%, respectively). The most common AEs (≥2% of subjects) 
leading to dose reduction in the TISS were rash (8%), decreased ejection fraction (2%) and 
dermatitis acneiform (2%). In study MEK114267 the most common AEs (≥2% of subjects) leading 
to dose reduction in the trametinib arm were rash (10%), and decreased ejection fraction (3%), the 
incidence of which was higher compared with the chemotherapy arm (both 0%, respectively). Each 
AE leading to dose reduction in the chemotherapy arm occurred in 1 subject, with the exception of 
neutrophil count decreased (2%). 
The most common AEs (≥2% of subjects) leading to dose interruptions in the TISS were rash (9%), 
diarrhoea (5%), ejection fraction decreased (3%), oedema peripheral (2%), ALT increased (2%), 
left ventricular dysfunction (2%), fatigue (2%), pyrexia (2%), cellulitis (2%), dehydration (2%), 
nausea (2%) and vomiting (2%). Similar percentages were observed in the trametinib arm of study 
MEK114267. With the exception of fatigue, the incidence of all these most common events was 
higher compared with the chemotherapy arm. The most common AEs leading to dose interruptions 
in the chemotherapy arm were platelet count decreased (4%), neutropenia (3%), fatigue (2%), 
anaemia (2%), pancytopenia (2%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%). 
Combination Trametinib-Dabrafenib 
The frequency of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was similar between the 
Part C 150/2 group (9%) and the uTISS population (10%), but higher than the DISS population 
(3%). Two of the 5 subjects who discontinued study drug permanently due to an AE discontinued 
due to pyrexia. 
The proportion of patients reporting AEs leading to dose reductions was higher in the Part C 150/2 
population (49%) compared with the TISS (26%) and the DISS (17%), and was essentially due to 
pyrexia (35%), followed by chills and nausea (9% each), vomiting and decreased ejection fraction 
(7% each). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 116/132 
 
  
  
The proportion of patients reporting AEs leading to dose interruptions was higher in the Part C 
150/2 population (67%) compared with the uTISS (36%) and the DISS (33%), and was essentially 
due to pyrexia (42%), followed by chills (22%), decreased ejection fraction (9%), arthralgia, 
diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting and neutropenia (7% each). Importantly, no subjects had 
dose interruptions for AEs of PPE in the Part C 150/2 group (in contrast with 10 cases (2%) in the 
DISS population) as well as no patients had AEs of rash leading to dose interruption in the Part C 
150/2 group. 
For patients receiving treatment with trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in the MEK115306 
study, when compared with the dabrafenib/placebo arm, AEs leading to dose reduction or 
interruption were reported in 45% and 24% of patients, respectively. The most common event 
leading to dose modification (reduction, interruption and permanent discontinuation) was pyrexia. 
Permanent discontinuation due to an AE was reported in 9% of the patients in the combination arm 
vs 5% in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. AEs leading to dose reduction were reported in 24% for 
the combination arm and 13% for the monotherapy arm. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of trametinib as monotherapy was consistent across studies: rash and other skin 
events, gastrointestinal (e.g. diarrhoea, nausea vomiting) and ocular toxicities, peripheral oedema, 
and hypertension were prominent and dose limiting, whereas hematologic toxicity was very limited.  
Trametinib as monotherapy appears to be less well tolerated compared with chemotherapy (i.e. 
paclitaxel, dacarbazine). However, the analysis is hampered by the difference in treatment duration 
observed between the two study arms. In addition, the dose of dacarbazine used in the pivotal trial 
(1000 mg/m2) is higher than the dose commonly used in clinical practice (850 mg/m2) and 
recommended in the SmPC of most EU countries.  
Safety data obtained from phase I and II clinical study indicate that the trametinib-dabrafenib 
150/2 mg combination is less well tolerated than both drugs given as monotherapy (uTISS and 
DISS) showing a higher rate of AE that have led to dose mitigation or interruption of treatment, 
than ‘monotherapy’ dabrafenib/placebo. Also the rate of SAE was higher in the 
dabrafenib/trametinib combination. A comparison of updated AE of special interest between study 
arm in MEK115306 shows that hepatic disorders, diarrhoea, hypertension, oedema, pyrexia, 
hyperglycaemia and neutropenia were all more commonly seen with combination therapy while 
CuSCC was reported more commonly in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm. However, several 
peculiar toxicities observed with the drugs given as monotherapy, were observed with a frequency 
lower than it would have been expected, probably due to mutual inhibition achieved by combination 
therapy of paradoxical activation of RAF, RAS or MEK –MAP kinase pathways caused by single 
selective inhibition of BRAF or MEK. The most frequently reported AEs with the combination 
treatment included pyrexia (71%), chills (58%), fatigue (53%), nausea (44%), and vomiting 
(40%), and the incidence was significantly higher compared with the trametinib and dabrafenib 
monotherapy. The incidences of rash (27%) and diarrhoea (36%) were 1.5 to 2 fold lower 
compared with the trametinib monotherapy population (58% and 49%, respectively). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013

In general the safety results of the MEK115306 study confirm the toxicity profile of the 
trametinib-dabrafenib combination treatment as determined in the BRF113220 study. However, 
the evaluation of the toxicity profile of the combination trametinib-dabrafenib is hampered by the 
patients treated by relatively short follow-up. 
Pyrexia has been reported in clinical trials with trametinib as monotherapy and in combination with 
dabrafenib. The incidence and severity of pyrexia are increased with the combination therapy.  
LVEF reduction has been reported with trametinib, when used as monotherapy or in combination 
with dabrafenib. In clinical trials, the mean time to onset of left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF 
decrease was between 2 to 4 months. Therefore, trametinib should be used with caution in patients 
with impaired left ventricular function. Safety in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, New York 
Heart Association Class II, III, or IV heart failure, acute coronary syndrome within the past 6 
months, clinically significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, and uncontrolled hypertension, is unknown 
as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. As a consequence, LVEF should be evaluated in 
all patients prior to initiation of treatment with trametinib, one month after initiation of therapy, and 
then at approximately 3 monthly intervals while on treatment (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Trametinib should be interrupted in patients who have an asymptomatic, absolute decrease of > 10 
% in LVEF compared to baseline and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s lower limit of 
normal (LLN). With Grade 3 or 4 left ventricular cardiac dysfunction or if LVEF does not recover 
trametinib should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
Cumulative safety analyses will be submitted annually, and for one year after the last patient has 
completed clinical trial treatment, to identify and characterize the risk of cardiomyopathy and 
subsequent sequelae, including safety evaluations adequate to inform labelling of patient 
populations at highest risk for developing these toxicities and to provide evidence-based dose 
modification and monitoring recommendations (see RMP). 
The applicant also committed to conduct a study (MEK114655) to evaluate the effect of trametinib 
on QTc in patients with solid tumours and to provide the results by Q4 2015 (see RMP).  
Peripheral oedema was reported in around 40% of patients treated with trametinib monotherapy 
compared with 5% of patients treated with chemotherapy. In about 50% of cases oedema was 
associated with left ventricular dysfunction (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).  
Elevations in blood pressure have been reported in association with trametinib and trametinib in 
combination with dabrafenib, in patients with or without pre-existing hypertension. Blood pressure 
should be measured at baseline and monitored during treatment with trametinib, with control of 
hypertension by standard therapy as appropriate (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Patients treated with trametinib may develop ILD or pneumonitis. Trametinib should be withheld in 
patients with suspected ILD or pneumonitis, including patients presenting with new or progressive 
pulmonary symptoms and findings including cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, pleural effusion, or 
infiltrates, pending clinical investigations. Trametinib should be permanently discontinued for 
patients diagnosed with treatment-related ILD or pneumonitis (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 118/132 
 
  
  
Skin-related events essentially consisted of rash and dermatitis acneiform. In clinical studies with 
trametinib, rash has been observed in about 60 % of patients. The majority of these cases were 
Grade 1 or 2 and did not require any dose interruptions or dose reductions (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 
of the SmPC). Supportive care guidelines regarding dose adjustment depending on the severity of 
the rash have been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Disorders associated with visual disturbance, including RPED and RVO, have been observed with 
trametinib as monotherapy. Symptoms such as blurred vision, decreased acuity, and other visual 
phenomena have been reported in the clinical trials with trametinib. The safety of trametinib in 
subjects with predisposing factors for retinal vein occlusion (RVO), including uncontrolled glaucoma 
or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, or a history of 
hyperviscosity or hypercoagulability syndromes, has not been established. A prompt 
ophthalmological assessment is recommended if patients report new visual disturbances, such as 
diminished central vision, blurry vision or loss of vision at any time while on trametinib therapy. If 
RPED is diagnosed, dose modification should be undertaken. In patients who are diagnosed with 
RVO, treatment with trametinib should be permanently discontinued (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC). 
Hepatic adverse events have been reported in clinical trials with trametinib. It is recommended that 
patients receiving treatment with trametinib have liver function monitored every four weeks for 6 
months after treatment initiation with trametinib (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
Renal failure was reported with trametinib monotherapy. Renal failure AEs were associated with 
pyrexia or diarrhoea in the majority of cases, where dehydration could be a contributing factor. 
Haemorrhagic events, including major haemorrhagic events, have occurred in patients taking 
trametinib. The potential for these events in patients with brain metastases or low platelets (< 
100,000) is not established as patients with these conditions were excluded from clinical trials. The 
risk of haemorrhage may be increased with concomitant use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant 
therapy. If haemorrhage occurs, patients should be treated as clinically indicated. Haemorrhage 
has therefore been included in the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition “haemorrhagic 
events” has been added as an important risk for trametinib in the RMP. 
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients taking trametinib. In some cases, patients were able 
to continue trametinib. In more severe cases hospitalisation, interruption or permanent 
discontinuation of trametinib was required. Signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis should warrant 
an appropriate clinical evaluation and treatment as indicated (see section 4.4 of the SmPC and 
RMP). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 119/132 
 
  
  
Based on available data, a possible trend towards a slightly worse tolerability of trametinib in 
patients with mild hepatic impairment could be hypothesized but the limited number of patients 
treated does not allow drawing any firm conclusion over this issue. No dosage adjustment is 
required in patients with mild hepatic impairment. There are no clinical data in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, the potential need for starting dose adjustment 
cannot be determined and administration of trametinib should be undertaken with caution in those 
patients (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). As metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary routes 
of elimination of trametinib, administration of trametinib should be undertaken with caution in 
patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The Applicant commits to provide 
post-approval the results of a planned pharmacokinetic trial to determine the appropriate dose of 
trametinib in patients with hepatic impairment. The study report should be available by Q4 2017. 
As the PK data available appear to confirm no significant effect of renal impairment on the PK and 
safety of trametinib, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment. There are no data with trametinib in patients with severe renal impairment; therefore, 
the potential need for starting dose adjustment cannot be determined. Trametinib should be used 
with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. 
More frequent dose adjustments may be required in patients > 65 years of age. 
In clinical trials with trametinib one case of accidental overdose was reported; a single dose of 4 mg. 
No AEs were reported following this event of trametinib overdose (data not shown). There is no 
specific treatment for overdose and in case overdose occurs, the patient should be treated 
supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Trametinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. The clinical status of the 
patient and the adverse reaction profile should be borne in mind when considering the patient’s 
ability to perform tasks that require judgment, motor and cognitive skills. Patients should be made 
aware of potential for fatigue, dizziness or eye problems that might affect these activities (see 
section 4.7 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The toxicity of trametinib includes rash and other skin events, gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhea, 
nausea vomiting) and ocular toxicities, peripheral oedema, and hypertension, whereas hematologic 
toxicity was very limited. The AEs were usually mild or moderate in severity, and toxicity was 
usually manageable, at least when adequate monitoring of patients was performed and established 
guidelines were followed. Due to the peculiarity of the AEs observed, specific and periodical 
monitoring (ophtalmological, dermatological, cardiological [LVEF/ECG] evaluation) is required in 
order to allow prevention and early management of clinically relevant consequences.  
In study MEK115306, all SAEs except cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma had a higher frequency 
(>2%) in the combination arm than in the dabrafenib arm.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Trametinib monotherapy 
The results of the PFS analysis in the ITT population of the MEK114267 pivotal study shows a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS (assessed by investigators) for trametinib monotherapy 
compared with chemotherapy (HR=0.45, 95% CI 0.33-0.63, p<0.0001, median PFS 4.8 vs 1.5 
months, respectively).  
The median OS was 15.6 months (95% CI; 14.0, 17.4) in the trametinib arm and 11.3 months 
(95% CI; 7.2, 14.8) in the chemotherapy arm. The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.78 (95% CI; 0.57, 
1.06) with a p value of 0.09. ORR (according to IRC assessment) was also significantly higher with 
trametinib compared with chemotherapy (22% vs 8%, respectively, p=0.0100).  
No benefit has been observed for trametinib when given sequentially after refractoriness to 
BRAF-inhibition in patients with melanoma harbouring BRAF V600 mutations. Although the caveats 
related to inter study comparison are acknowledged, the magnitude of the effect in terms of ORR 
observed with trametinib as monotherapy in treatment naïve melanoma patients appears to be 
lower than the effect observed with selective BRAF-TKi (e.g. vemurafenib, dabrafenib.  
In the studies performed to date with trametinib monotherapy the majority of melanoma patients 
presented BRAF V600E mutations. Whilst the ORR appears lower in patients with tumours 
expressing the V600K mutation, efficacy in terms of PFS seems to be essentially similar comparing 
V600E and V600K. The CHMP concluded that there was enough evidence to support a broader 
indication of “V600 mutation” and not to restrict the indication to BRAF V600E patient population. 
Trametinib-Dabrafenib combination 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 128/132 
 
  
  
The evidence of efficacy of trametinib in combination with dabrafenib in patients with unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma was initially based on the results of one phase I/II study (BRF113220) 
proposed as pivotal for this indication.  
Confirmatory results from the phase III study MEK115306 comparing the combination 
dabrafenib-trametinib vs dabrafenib monotherapy have been submitted during the course of the 
procedure. The median PFS for the combination trametinib/dabrafenib arm was 9.3 months) 
compared to 8.8 months for the monotherapy dabrafenib. The HR for PFS as assessed by the 
independent review committee (IRC) was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.04; p=0.067).  For both arms 
median OS was not yet reached.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Trametinib-Dabrafenib combination 
No data are available regarding the efficacy of the drug in races others than Whites (Blacks, Asian, 
etc.). Similarly, no data are available in paediatric patients and experience in patients > 75 years of 
age is limited. The lack of data has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of trametinib as monotherapy was consistent across studies: rash and other skin 
events, gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea vomiting) and ocular toxicities, peripheral 
oedema, and hypertension were prominent and dose limiting, whereas hematologic toxicity was 
very limited. Trametinib as monotherapy appears to be less well tolerated compared with 
chemotherapy (i.e. paclitaxel, dacarbazine). However, the analysis is hampered by the difference in 
treatment duration observed between the two study arms. Moreover, quality of life data did not 
show significant difference between the two study arms. In patients treated with the combination 
dabrafenib-trametinib, compared with the trametinib and dabrafenib monotherapy populations, an 
increased incidence of AEs leading to dose reduction, AEs leading to dose interruption, grade 3/4 
AEs, and SAEs was observed. The most frequently reported AEs with the combination treatment 
included pyrexia (71%), chills (58%), fatigue (53%), nausea (44%), and vomiting (40%), and the 
incidence of such events was significantly higher compared with what observed with trametinib and 
dabrafenib monotherapy.  
Headline results from the MEK115306 study with a median time on study treatment of 8 months for 
the combination arm and 7 months for the dabrafenib ‘monotherapy arm’, confirm the toxicity 
results obtained in the phase I/II BRF113220 study. Overall the safety profile as observed in 
MEK115306 show a higher rate of AE that have led to dose mitigation or interruption of treatment 
in the combination treatment as compared to monotherapy. Also the rate of SAE was higher in the 
dabrafenib/trametinib combination. A comparison of updated AEs of special interest between study 
arms in MEK115306 shows that hepatic disorders, diarrhoea, hypertension, oedema, pyrexia, 
hyperglycaemia and neutropenia were all more commonly seen with combination therapy while 
CuSCC was reported more commonly in the dabrafenib monotherapy arm.  
CHMP assessment report

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There are limited/no data in paediatric patients, races other than White and patients ≥ 75 years old 
which was reflected in the SmPC and the RMP.  
Available data indicate a possible trend towards a slightly worse tolerability of trametinib in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment but the limited number of patients treated does not allow drawing any 
firm conclusion on this issue. There are no clinical data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment. The results of a pharmacokinetic trial to determine the appropriate dose of trametinib 
in patients with hepatic impairment will be available by Q4 2017. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the context of unmet medical need for patients with metastatic melanomas harbouring BRAF 
V600 mutation, the results provided in terms of improved PFS and OS for trametinibare considered 
of clinical relevance. For trametinib monotherapy, cross study comparison shows that the PFS and 
OS benefit for trametinib appears to be comparable to what is reported for approved BRAF inhibitors 
(dabrafenib and vemurafenib). 
Of note, the patient population included in the study was BRAF-inhibitor naïve. In another phase II 
study, no clinically relevant effect was observed with trametinib monotherapy in patients 
pre-treated with a BRAF inhibitor.  
Regarding the combination trametinib-dabrafenib therapy, although the pharmacological rationale 
was considered justified, and early clinical data were considered promising, more comprehensive 
efficacy data from a phase III trial failed to confirm the magnitude and statistical significance of the 
effect. Both PFS and OS data are considered too immature to provide corroborating evidence of 
efficacy. 
 Trametinib as monotherapy, although associated with higher toxicity compared with paclitaxel, 
dacarbazine, was not associated with worsened quality of life. The AEs were usually mild or 
moderate in severity, and toxicity was usually manageable when adequate monitoring of patients 
was performed and established guidelines were followed.  
Overall, albeit manageable, the toxicity of the combination was not negligible, with a higher rate of 
AEs that have led to dose mitigation or interruption of treatment in the combination treatment, a 
higher proportion of patients experiencing SAEs and hepatic disorders, diarrhoea, hypertension, 
oedema, pyrexia, hyperglycaemia and neutropenia more commonly seen with combination 
therapy.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/675236/2013 
Page 130/132 
 
 
 
  
  
Benefit-risk balance 
The efficacy of trametinib monotherapy in the population of patients with BRAF V600 mutation 
positive melanoma has clearly been established in terms of PFS and OS in MEK14267 is robustly 
demonstrated when compared to chemotherapy. Although, trametinib monotherapy appears to be 
less well tolerated compared to chemotherapy (i.e. paclitaxel, dacarbazine), the AEs were usually 
mild or moderate in severity, and toxicity was usually manageable when adequate monitoring of 
patients was performed and established guidelines were followed. It is concluded that the 
benefit-risk balance for trametinib monotherapy is positive.  
The proposed trametinib-dabrafenib combination treatment is supported by a strong biological 
rationale. However, based on early clinical data and immature phase III data, the efficacy has not 
been established.  
Although the AEs of the combination therapy are generally manageable when safety guidelines are 
followed, in the absence of established efficacy the benefit-risk balance could not be considered to 
be positive. The applicant withdrew the combination indication from the applied indication. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
No head-to-head comparison of trametinib monotherapy with BRAF inhibitors could be conducted 
as no BRAF inhibitors were approved at the time the trametinib monotherapy phase 3 study started.  
Although the caveats related to indirect study comparison are acknowledged, the ORR observed 
with trametinib in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma patients appears lower than the ORR observed 
with BRAF inhibitors (i.e., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) in a comparable patient population. 
Nevertheless, there is no concern that patients have a risk to miss the opportunity of effective 
therapy by using trametinib instead of a BRAF inhibitor as first line treatment: the efficacy of a BRAF 
inhibition after MEK inhibition may still be apparent.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Mekinist in the treatment of “adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Trametinib monotherapy has not demonstrated 
clinical activity in patients who have progressed on a prior BRAF inhibitor therapy”  
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

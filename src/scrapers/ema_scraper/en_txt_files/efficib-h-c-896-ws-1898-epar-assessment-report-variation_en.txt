2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Sitagliptin is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control by preventing the 
enzymatic degradation and inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP, the major incretins involved in glucose 
homeostasis. Metformin is a biguanide that lowers glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose 
output (through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and increasing insulin sensitivity in the 
liver and in muscle.  
Insulin and liraglutide injections are, at this time, the only antihyperglycaemic agents approved for 
treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients. Studies P170 and P289 evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
sitagliptin added on to metformin (as the Sita/Met IR and Sita/Met XR FDCs) as an alternative oral 
treatment option for pediatric patients with T2DM. Studies P170 and P289 were similarly designed, Phase 
3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin 
therapy. In Study P170, sitagliptin was added on to metformin IR (±insulin) as the Sita/Met IR FDC; in 
Study P289, sitagliptin was added on to metformin XR (±insulin) as the Sita/Met XR FDC.  
Data summarized in this clinical overview are from Studies P170 and P289 individually and from a pool of 
their results combined.  
No indication is sought for the Sita/Met IR FDC or the Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric patients with T2DM. 
However, to reflect the data from these two studies, the MAH proposes changes in the text of the SmPC. 
Clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated in 
paediatric patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. In this population, the dose adjusted 
AUC of sitagliptin in plasma was approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with type 2 
diabetes for a 100 mg dose.

Page 3/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Characteristics 
The populations evaluated in Studies P170 and P289 are representative of the pediatric population with 
T2DM. The mean age was 14.4 years, 44.5% of subjects were in the younger age category (≥10 and <15 
years), and 65.9% of the subjects were female. At baseline, the mean A1C was 8.0% and the mean BMI 
was 30.9 kg/m2. The dose of background metformin was >1500 mg/day for 71.8% of subjects and 
15.0% of subjects were on background insulin therapy A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 In the 2-study pool. 
Benefits 
In the 2-study pool, the success criterion for superiority of A1C reduction in the Sita/Met FDC group over 
the Metformin group at Week 20 was met in the analysis addressing the Treatment Effect estimand but 
was not met in the analysis addressing the Treatment Policy estimand. In both groups, earlier 
improvements in A1C were no longer observed at Week 54.  
In addition, the observed mean changes in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were inconsistent between 
Study P170 and Study P289. In Study P170, the observed mean changes from baseline in A1C at Week 
20 and Week 54 were greater in the Sita/Met IR FDC group compared to the Metformin IR group in both 
the Treatment Effect FAS and the Treatment Policy FAS. However, in Study P289, the observed mean 
changes from baseline in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were not greater in the Sita/Met XR FDC group 
compared to the Metformin XR group in both the Treatment Effect FAS and the Treatment Policy FAS.  
Risks 
There were 220 randomized and treated subjects in the 2-study pool (107 in the Sita/Met FDC group and 
113 in the Metformin group).  
Adverse events overall 
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of AEs overall, drug-related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20.  
Serious adverse events 
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of SAEs were similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups 
through Week 20 and Week 54.  
One death, in the Sita/Met FDC group, was reported in the 2-study pool 122 days after the last dose of 
study medication.  
Adverse events  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of specific AEs were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and 
Metformin groups through Week 20 and Week 54. Relative to the Metformin group, the incidence of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased was higher, and the incidence of headache was lower in the Sita/Met 
FDC group. For both AEs, results through Week 54 were consistent with those through Week 20. 
Assessment report  
EMA/603247/2020 
Page 4/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, through Week 54, there were no specific AEs for which the 95% CIs for the between-group 
differences excluded 0. 
Hypoglycaemia 
In the 2-study pool in subjects not on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group. The incidences of severe hypoglycemia were low (≤3 subjects per group) and similar in the 2 
groups.  
In the 2-study pool in subjects on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group through Week 20. Only 1 subject in each group had severe hypoglycemia through Weeks 20 and 
54.  
Benefit/risk balance 
Efficacy of treatment with sitagliptin added on to metformin (IR or XR) in pediatric subjects with T2DM 
was inconsistent between the 2 studies after 20 weeks and absent after 54 weeks.  
Safety for 54 weeks was generally similar to that in adults. However, in patients with and without insulin, 
sitagliptin was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia.  
The insufficient efficacy is in line with data from a study using sitagliptin monotherapy in paediatric 
patients (10 to 17 years of age) with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not provide 
significant improvement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin 
was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated with placebo, a difference of -0.2% (95% CI: -0.7, 0.3) 
(SmPC Januvia). 
Therefore, sitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of 
insufficient efficacy. This is now stated in the SmPC. The increased risk of hypoglycaemia should be added 
to the text of the SmPC. In addition, several other changes in the text were necessary (see SmPC).  
The information with respect to the results of Studies P170 and P289 is also relevant for the SmPC of the 
monoproduct sitagliptin. This information was considered not warranted to be added to the SmPC of the 
monoproduct as already sufficiently described. 
An explanation for the low efficacy in paediatric patients is not clear, but may be related to the lower 
exposure (approximately 18% lower dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ after single doses of sitagliptin) in paediatric 
individuals compared to adults. 
The benefit-risk balance of Efficib, Janumet, Velmetia, Ristfor, remains positive in adults.

Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
4.  Introduction 
This clinical overview presents efficacy and safety results for MK-0431A (Sita/Met IR FDC) and MK-0431A 
XR (Sita/Met XR FDC) from 2 Phase 3 studies (P170 and P289) conducted in pediatric subjects (10 to 17 
years old) with T2DM. Data summarized in this clinical overview are from Studies P170 and P289 
individually and from a pool of their results combined (hereafter referred to as the 2-study pool). 
Additionally, this clinical overview references results from 2 Phase 1 studies (P081 and P296). Study P081 
assessed the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of sitagliptin in pediatric subjects with T2DM. Study P296 
assessed the PK, safety, tolerability, and swallowability of the Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric subjects with 
T2DM.  
4.1.  Pharmacological Class  
Sitagliptin is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control by preventing the 
enzymatic degradation and inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP, the major incretins involved in glucose 
homeostasis. These hormones lower glucose levels through enhancement of insulin biosynthesis and 
release when blood glucose levels are normal or elevated, and through suppression of glucagon. 
Metformin is a biguanide that lowers glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose output 
(through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and increasing insulin sensitivity in the liver 
and in muscle. The complementary mechanisms of action through which sitagliptin and metformin lower 
glucose concentrations suggest that the combined use of these AHAs in pediatric patients with T2DM 
could improve glycemic control in this population.  
4.2.  Indication  
No indication is sought for the Sita/Met IR FDC or the Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric patients with T2DM.  
4.3.  Scientific Background  
4.3.1.  Disease or Condition  
The incidence and prevalence of T2DM in the pediatric population are increasing worldwide [Ref. 5.4: 
04XV7S]. In youths, T2DM is characterized by a rapid and progressive decrease in insulin secretion, 
progressive increase in insulin resistance, overproduction of hepatic glucose, and excessive levels of 
glucagon [Ref. 5.4: 03QG4T, 03QDJM, 03PX9Y, 03QG39, 03QG4W], leading to increased blood glucose 
levels. In pediatric patients, as in adults, blood glucose levels influence the development and progression 
of microvascular complications, and likely macrovascular complications [Ref. 5.4: 03RJSK, 03QG50]. 
Given the substantial lifelong cumulative exposure to hyperglycemia for this population, the availability of 
therapies with sustained efficacy is necessary.  
4.3.2.  Current Therapies  
Metformin is the only broadly approved oral AHA for treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients [Ref. 5.4: 
03QTB3, 03RT49, 03QTJH]. Metformin is initially effective in lowering A1C [Ref. 5.4: 03QTH2], but 
studies suggest that approximately 50% of pediatric patients need an additional AHA within a year of 
Assessment report  
EMA/603247/2020 
Page 7/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
diagnosis [Ref. 5.4: 03RTF0]. Insulin and liraglutide are, at this time, the only other AHAs approved for 
treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients. However, the parenteral administration of insulin and liraglutide, 
as well as safety and tolerability issues including hypoglycemia for insulin and GI side effects for 
liraglutide, may reduce patient compliance with these AHAs and consequently limit pediatric patients from 
achieving adequate glycemic control. Sitagliptin improves glycemic control and is generally well tolerated 
in adults with T2DM. Based on its mechanism of action and the similar pathophysiology underlying T2DM 
in adult and pediatric patients, the efficacy and safety profiles of sitagliptin in these populations were 
expected to be similar. Studies P170 and P289 evaluated the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin added on to 
metformin (as the Sita/Met IR and Sita/Met XR FDCs) as an alternative oral treatment option for pediatric 
patients with T2DM.  
4.4.  Overview of the Sita/Met FDC Phase 3 Pediatric Program  
Studies P170 and P289 were similarly designed, Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
studies of sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy. In Study P170, sitagliptin was added on to 
metformin IR (±insulin) as the Sita/Met IR FDC; in Study P289, sitagliptin was added on to metformin XR 
(±insulin) as the Sita/Met XR FDC. In both studies, subjects who met predefined glycemic thresholds 
during the 54-week treatment period were to initiate insulin therapy or titrate the dose of their 
background insulin therapy (glycemic rescue). Study P170 had a 20-week base study and a 34-week 
extension study. Study P289 had a 20-week Phase A and a 34-week Phase B. The extension study of 
Study P170 was added approximately 3 years after the base study began so that results from Study P170 
could be pooled with those from Study P289. Subjects who completed the base study before the 
extension study was available were not eligible to enter the extension study. Additional details on the 
designs of Studies P170 and P289 are in [Table 2.5- Type2DM0431A: 1] and the study protocols.

Program  
Assessment report

Page 8/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
4.4.1.  Pooling Strategy  
Data from Studies P170 and P289 were pooled based on their similar designs, entry criteria, and visit 
schedules, with each study having efficacy and safety assessments at Week 20 (primary time point) and 
Week 54. For Week 20 objectives, data from the base study of Study P170 and from Phase A of Study 
P289 were pooled. For Week 54 objectives, data from the base + extension studies of Study P170 and 
from Phases A + B of Study P289 were pooled. In the 2-study pool, subjects randomized to the addition 
of sitagliptin to metformin IR or XR (as the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR FDC) constitute the “Sita/Met FDC” 
group and subjects randomized to the addition of placebo to metformin IR or XR constitute the 
“Metformin” group.  
4.4.2.  Changes in Study Conduct  
During the time from first subject screened to the last subject’s last visit (approximately 8 years in Study 
P170 and 6 years in Study P289), each of these Phase 3 protocols was amended multiple times, mainly to 
address input from health authorities or for country-specific requests. For Study P170, this duration 
included subject participation in the 34-week extension study that was added by way of a protocol 
amendment [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 16.1.1.4]. Key changes for each amendment are listed in [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 9-2] for Study P170 and [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 9-2] for 
Study P289.  
4.5.  Regulatory Guidance and Advice  
The design and conduct of Studies P170 and P289 were consistent with regulatory guidance. Both studies 
were US FDA postmarketing requirements. The European Medicines Agency waived the PIP requirement 
to study MK-0431A in the pediatric population. MK-0431A XR is not registered in the EU and therefore not 
subject to a PIP requirement.  
4.6.  Good Clinical Practice  
Studies P170 and P289 were conducted in accordance with current standard research approaches with 
regard to the design, conduct, and analysis of such studies, including the archiving of essential 
documents. The studies were conducted following appropriate Good Clinical Practice standards and 
considerations for the ethical treatment of human participants that were in place at the time the studies 
were performed.  
5.  Overview of Biopharmaceutics  
All dose strengths of the Sita/Met IR and Sita/Met XR FDCs studied in pediatric subjects were previously 
evaluated in adults. Therefore, no new biopharmaceutics data are provided in this submission.  
6.  Overview of Clinical Pharmacology  
One clinical pharmacology study of sitagliptin (Study P081) was conducted in pediatric subjects. Study 
P081 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-panel, single-dose PK study of 
sitagliptin (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) in 35 pediatric subjects (10 to 17 years old) with T2DM [Ref. 
5.3.3.2: P081]. Results from this study show that, relative to adults with T2DM (data from Study P005), 
pediatric subjects with T2DM have an approximately 18% lower dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ after single doses 
of sitagliptin when pooling across the 3 doses in Study P081 versus pooling across the 2 doses (25 mg 
and 200 mg) in Study P005. The PK/PD relationship between sitagliptin plasma concentration and DPP-4 
Assessment report  
EMA/603247/2020 
Page 9/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
inhibition was similar in pediatric and adult subjects with T2DM. Any modest differences in the extent of 
DPP-4 inhibition at 100 mg, that would be attributable to the slight differences in plasma sitagliptin 
concentrations in pediatric subjects, were not deemed to be clinically meaningful, given the relatively flat 
dose response in A1C change from baseline observed between 50 mg and 100 mg per day of sitagliptin in 
adult subjects with T2DM [Ref. 5.4: 03QSXL, 05F3HZ]. Therefore, the 100 mg/day dose of sitagliptin was 
chosen for evaluation in the Phase 3 pediatric program. Additional details on the design and results for 
Study P081 are available in the CSR [Ref. 5.3.3.2: P081]. Additionally, based on PK, safety, tolerability, 
and swallowability data from a Phase 1 study of the Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric subjects with T2DM 
(Study P296), a daily dose of up to 100 mg/2000 mg of the Sita/Met XR FDC was determined to be 
appropriate in the sitagliptin Phase 3 pediatric program. Additional details on the design and results for 
Study P296 are available in the CSR [Ref. 5.3.3.2: P296].  
7.  Overview of Efficacy  
7.1.  Efficacy Analyses and Statistical Methods  
The glycemic efficacy of sitagliptin added on to metformin (as Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR FDC) was 
evaluated in the 2-study pool through analyses of A1C (primary endpoint), FPG, the proportions of 
subjects with A1C <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and <6.5% (48 mmol/mol), and the proportions of subjects 
who received glycemic rescue therapy. The population for efficacy analyses was the FAS. The FAS for 
Week 20 efficacy analyses included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication in the base study of Study P170 or Phase A of Study P289. The population for Week 54 
efficacy analyses was the subset of the FAS subjects who entered the extension study of Study P170 or 
Phase B of Study P289. Within the FAS, the data included in analyses of the primary endpoint differed, 
depending on the estimand being addressed. Analyses addressing the Treatment Effect estimand 
(primary estimand) excluded data after the last dose of study medication (plus a 5-day offset) and data 
after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy. Analyses addressing the Treatment Policy estimand 
(supplemental estimand) included all available data relative to the analysis timepoint regardless of 
whether the subject was still taking study medication or glycemic rescue therapy was initiated. Glycemic 
rescue was defined as ≥14 days of sustained insulin therapy following initiation of insulin or following a 
≥15% increase in the dose of background insulin relative to baseline. Unless otherwise noted, efficacy 
results described in this clinical overview for the 2-study pool address the Treatment Effect estimand. In 
the 2-study pool, a cLDA model was used in analyses addressing the Treatment Effect estimand. A 
supplemental analysis of A1C change from baseline addressing the Treatment Policy estimand used an 
ANCOVA model with the RTB approach for missing data imputation. The RTB approach was used in lieu of 
the RD approach because the prespecified minimum required number of RD subjects for performing the 
RD approach was not met [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 22]. Results for efficacy endpoints (changes 
over time in A1C and FPG, the proportions of subjects meeting A1C goals, and the proportions of subjects 
initiating glycemic rescue therapy) in Studies P170 and P289 individually were summarized using 
descriptive statistics only. For both studies, the populations for efficacy assessments were consistent with 
those described above for the 2-study pool. A1C results for these studies were summarized in the 
Treatment Effect and Treatment Policy FAS. Unless otherwise noted, efficacy results described in this 
clinical overview for Studies P170 and P289 are based on the Treatment Effect FAS. For the 2-study pool 
and the individual studies, the statistical methodology for analyses of efficacy endpoints are provided in 
the Study P170 base study and extension study SAPs [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 16.1.9.1] and the 
Study P289 SAP [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 16.1.9.1]. Changes and clarifications to analyses 
prespecified in the protocol SAPs before the database locks are described in the Summary of Changes to 
the P170 and P289 SAPs [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 16.1.9.2] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 16.1.9.2].

7.2.  Relevance and Key Features of the Study Population  
The results from the 2-study pool and Studies P170 and P289 individually provide a comprehensive 
evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the Sita/Met IR and XR FDCs in pediatric subjects with T2DM. Two 
hundred twenty subjects were randomized and treated in Studies P170 and P289 combined. Enrollment in 
each of these studies occurred globally, including subjects from North America, Europe, Latin America, 
and Asia. The populations in these studies had adequate representation of male and female subjects and 
subjects across different age categories (≥10 and <15 years and ≥15 and <18 years). Disease criteria for 
entry into these studies were generally consistent with scientific society guidelines for diagnosis and 
treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients.  
7.3.  Baseline Demographics and Disease Characteristics  
In the 2-study pool (AST population), baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally 
comparable between the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups [Sec. 2.7.3- Type2DM0431A: 3.1]. The 
mean age was 14.4 years, 44.5% of subjects were in the younger age category (≥10 and <15 years), 
and 65.9% of the subjects were female. At baseline, the mean A1C was 8.0% and the mean BMI was 
30.9 kg/m2. The dose of background metformin was >1500 mg/day for 71.8% of subjects and 15.0% of 
subjects were on background insulin therapy [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 1, 4]. Subjects in the 2-
study pool had medical disorders (eg, obesity, acanthosis nigricans) and were being treated for 
comorbidities (eg, hypertension and dyslipidemia) commonly associated with T2DM [Table 5.3.5.3.2- 
Type2DM0431A: 6] through [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 9]. Baseline demographics and disease 
characteristics in the pooled subset of subjects who entered the extension study of Study P170 or Phase 
B of Study P289 [Table 5.3.5.3.2- Type2DM0431A: 2, 5] were generally consistent with those of the 2-
study pool AST population. Baseline demographics and disease characteristics for subjects in Studies 
P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 10.4] and P289 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 10.4] individually were 
generally consistent with those of the 2-study pool AST population.  
7.4.  Efficacy Results  
7.4.1.  Efficacy Results for the 2-Study Pool  
A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 In the 2-study pool, the success criterion for superiority of A1C reduction in 
the Sita/Met FDC group over the Metformin group at Week 20 was met in the analysis addressing the 
Treatment Effect estimand (p=0.018) [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 2]. Improvements from baseline in A1C 
in the Sita/Met FDC group compared with the Metformin group were observed at Week 6 and generally 
persisted through Week 20 [Figure 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 1]. The success criterion for superiority of A1C 
reduction in the Sita/Met FDC group over the Metformin group at Week 20 was not met in the analysis 
addressing the Treatment Policy estimand (p=0.087) [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 23]. At Week 20, 
the between-group differences for the Treatment Effect and Treatment Policy estimands were directionally 
similar, favoring the Sita/Met FDC group over the Metformin group [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 2] [Table 
5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 23]. Any apparent improvements from baseline in A1C observed at Week 20 
were no longer observed at Week 54 in both groups in analyses addressing the Treatment Effect [Figure 
2.7.3- Type2DM0431A: 2] [Table 2.7.3-Type2DM0431A: 7] and Treatment Policy [Table 5.3.5.3.2-
Type2DM0431A: 31] estimands.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints at Week 20 and Week 54 In the 2-study pool, no meaningful improvements 
in secondary efficacy endpoints were observed in the Sita/Met FDC group, compared with the Metformin 
group, at Week 20 or Week 54:  
• Changes from baseline in FPG were not notably different between the Sita/Met FDC and 
Metformin groups at Week 20 [Table 2.7.3-Type2DM0431A: 8] and Week 54 [Table 2.7.3-
Type2DM0431A: 9].  
Assessment report

• The estimated proportion of subjects with A1C <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) at Week 20 was greater 
in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin group [Table 2.7.3- Type2DM0431A: 10]. 
Results for this endpoint at Week 54 were not notably different between the 2 groups [Table 
2.7.3-Type2DM0431A: 11].  
• The estimated proportion of subjects who initiated glycemic rescue therapy was lower in the 
Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin group through Week 20 [Table 2.7.3- Type2DM0431A: 
12] [Figure 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 5]. Results through Week 54 were consistent with those 
observed through Week 20 [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 42] [Figure 5.3.5.3.2-
Type2DM0431A: 6].

7.4.1.1.  Subgroup Analyses  
In the 2-study pool, A1C change from baseline at Week 20 was generally consistent across subgroups 
[Figure 2.7.3-Type2DM0431A: 3] [Table 5.3.5.3.2-Type2DM0431A: 52]. Subgroup analyses were not 
performed in Studies P170 and P289 individually.  
7.4.2.  Efficacy Results for Studies P170 and P289  
Primary (A1C) efficacy results were inconsistent between Studies P170 and P289, at Week 20 and Week 
54. In Study P170, the observed mean changes from baseline in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were 
greater in the Sita/Met IR FDC group compared to the Metformin IR group in both the Treatment Effect 
FAS [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 3] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 11-2] and the Treatment Policy 
FAS [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 14.2-2, 14.2-5]. In contrast, in Study P289, the observed mean 
changes from baseline in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were not greater in the Sita/Met XR FDC group 
compared to the Metformin XR group in both the Treatment Effect FAS [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 4] 
[Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 11-2] and the Treatment Policy FAS [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A:

Summary of Efficacy 
Sitagliptin is a selective DPP-4 inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibitors improve glycemic control by preventing the 
enzymatic degradation and inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP, the major incretins involved in glucose 
homeostasis. Metformin is a biguanide that lowers glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose 
output (through inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and increasing insulin sensitivity in the 
liver and in muscle.  
Insulin and liraglutide are, at this time, the only other AHAs approved for treatment of T2DM in pediatric 
patients. Studies P170 and P289 evaluated the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin added on to metformin 
(as the Sita/Met IR and Sita/Met XR FDCs) as an alternative oral treatment option for pediatric patients 
with T2DM. Studies P170 and P289 were similarly designed, Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group studies of sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy. In Study P170, sitagliptin was 
added on to metformin IR (±insulin) as the Sita/Met IR FDC; in Study P289, sitagliptin was added on to 
metformin XR (±insulin) as the Sita/Met XR FDC.  
Data summarized in this clinical overview are from Studies P170 and P289 individually and from a pool of 
their results combined.  
No indication is sought for the Sita/Met IR FDC or the Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric patients with T2DM. 
Changes to the text of the SmPC are proposed. 
Clinical pharmacology 
One clinical pharmacology study of sitagliptin (Study P081) was conducted in pediatric subjects. Study 
P081 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-panel, single-dose PK study of 
sitagliptin (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg) in 35 pediatric subjects (10 to 17 years old) with T2DM. Results 
from this study show that, relative to adults with T2DM (data from Study P005), pediatric subjects with 
T2DM have an approximately 18% lower dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ after single doses of sitagliptin. 
Additionally, based on PK, safety, tolerability, and swallowability data from a Phase 1 study of the 
Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric subjects with T2DM (Study P296), a daily dose of up to 100 mg/2000 mg of 
the Sita/Met XR FDC was determined to be appropriate in the sitagliptin Phase 3 pediatric program.

Characteristics 
The populations evaluated in Studies P170 and P289 are representative of the pediatric population with 
T2DM. The mean age was 14.4 years, 44.5% of subjects were in the younger age category (≥10 and <15 
years), and 65.9% of the subjects were female. At baseline, the mean A1C was 8.0% and the mean BMI 
was 30.9 kg/m2. The dose of background metformin was >1500 mg/day for 71.8% of subjects and 
15.0% of subjects were on background insulin therapy A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 In the 2-study pool. 
Results 
In the 2-study pool, the success criterion for superiority of A1C reduction in the Sita/Met FDC group over 
the Metformin group at Week 20 was met in the analysis addressing the Treatment Effect estimand but 
was not met in the analysis addressing the Treatment Policy estimand. In both groups, earlier 
improvements in A1C were no longer observed at Week 54.  
In addition, the observed mean changes in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were inconsistent between 
Study P170 and Study P289. In Study P170, the observed mean changes from baseline in A1C at Week 
20 and Week 54 were greater in the Sita/Met IR FDC group compared to the Metformin IR group in both 
the Treatment Effect FAS and the Treatment Policy FAS. However, in Study P289, the observed mean 
changes from baseline in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were not greater in the Sita/Met XR FDC group 
compared to the Metformin XR group in both the Treatment Effect FAS and the Treatment Policy FAS.  
Conclusion clinical efficacy 
The observed mean changes in A1C at Week 20 and Week 54 were inconsistent. Efficacy is insufficient. 
An explanation for the low efficacy in paediatric patients is not clear, but may be related to the lower 
exposure (approximately 18% lower dose-adjusted AUC0-∞ after single doses of sitagliptin) in paediatric 
individuals compared to adults. 
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
8.1.  Methods for Safety Analyses  
Safety was assessed by clinical evaluation of AEs, laboratory endpoints, vital signs, indices of adiposity, 
and growth and development endpoints. This clinical overview focuses on results from the 2-study pool 
because its larger population, relative to the individual studies, is better for detecting between-group 
differences for events occurring at lower incidences. Safety analyses were performed in the ASaT 
population. The ASaT population for Week 20 safety analyses included all randomized subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication in the base study of Study P170 or Phase A of Study P289. 
The population for Week 54 safety analyses was the subset of the ASaT subjects who entered the 
extension study of Study P170 or Phase B of Study P289. In the 2-study pool, an additional safety 
assessment through Week 54 was performed that included all randomized subjects who received at least 
1 dose of study medication. Unless otherwise noted, the descriptions of safety results through Week 54 in 
the 2-study pool are based on the subset of the ASaT subjects who participated beyond Week 20. In the 
2-study pool, prespecified (Tier 1) AEs of special interest were symptomatic hypoglycemia and select GI 
AEs (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting). Per Agency recommendations, other AEs of special 
interest were renal-related AEs (defined based on a Sponsor-generated CMQ), hypersensitivity AEs 
(defined based on the narrow SMQ for hypersensitivity), and infections (shown in the Infection and 
Infestation SOC). The terms for events based on a Sponsor-generated CMQ and terms in the narrow SMQ 
for hypersensitivity are listed in [Ref. 5.3.5.3.3: 059690]. In the 2-study pool, safety analyses followed a 
tiered approach. For Tier 1 AEs (symptomatic hypoglycemia and select GI AEs), statistical testing of 
between-group differences was performed. For Tier 2 endpoints, defined as those occurring in at least 4 
subjects in any group, 95% CIs for between-group differences were provided. For all other endpoints 
(Tier 3), point estimates by treatment group were provided. In Studies P170 and P289 individually, safety

endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics only. Except for hypoglycemia, analyses of all 
safety endpoints included data collected after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy.  
8.2.  Safety Results  
Based on the safety results in the 2-study pool, treatment with sitagliptin added on to metformin IR or XR 
(as the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR FDC) was well tolerated through Week 20 in the ASaT population and 
through Week 54 in the subset of the ASaT subjects who participated beyond Week 20. Results through 
Week 54 in the additional analyses that included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study medication were consistent with those in the subset of the ASaT subjects who participated beyond 
Week 20. No unique safety signal was identified for the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR FDC in pediatric 
subjects relative to adult subjects.  
8.2.1.  Disposition of Subjects  
There were 220 randomized and treated subjects in the 2-study pool (107 in the Sita/Met FDC group and 
113 in the Metformin group). Of these 220 subjects, 210 completed Week 20 and 147 (70 in the Sita/Met 
FDC group and 77 in the Metformin group) continued after Week 20 [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 5]. The 
number of subjects enrolled in the extension study of Study P170 was lower than in the base study of 
Study P170 primarily because the extension study was added approximately 3 years after the base study 
began and was not available to approximately 35% of the subjects [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 10.1]. 
Through Weeks 20 and 54, results across disposition categories in the 2-study pool were generally similar 
in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups. The percentages of subjects who completed Week 20 and the 
percentages who completed Week 54, among the subset who continued beyond Week 20, were high in 
both groups (>90%). In both groups, the most commonly reported reasons for study and study 
medication discontinuation were withdrawal by parent/guardian and withdrawal by subject [Table 2.5-
Type2DM0431A: 5]. Disposition of subjects in Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: Table 10-1] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 10-1] was generally consistent with that 
in the 2-study pool [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 5].

8.2.2.  Exposure, Compliance, and Adherence with Study Medication  
In the 2-study pool, there were no notable differences between the 2 groups in the extent of exposure to 
study medication (any dose) through Week 20 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 2, 4] and through Week 
54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 3, 5]. Compliance rates (proportion of days on the correct study 
medication between the subject’s first and last dose) and adherence rates (proportion of days on the 
correct study medication between the subject’s first dose and the end of the relevant study period [Week 
20 or Week 54]) for subjects in the 2-study pool were high in both groups. Through Week 20 and Week 
54, more than 93% of subjects were >80% compliant with study medication [Table 5.3.5.3.3- 
Type2DM0431A: 6, 7] and more than 84% of subjects were >80% adherent with study medication [Table 
5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 8, 9]. Exposure and compliance results in Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: 10.5, 10.6] and P289 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 10.5, 10.6] individually were 
generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool. Adherence rates were not calculated for the 
individual studies.  
8.2.3.  Summary of Adverse Events  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of AEs overall, drug-related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20 [Table 
2.5-Type2DM0431A: 6] and Week 54 [Table 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 7]. Results for these AE categories in 
Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 12-1, 12-2] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P289MK0431A: Table 12-1, 12-2] were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.

One death, in the Sita/Met FDC group, was reported in the 2-study pool [Sec. 2.5- Type2DM0431A: 
5.2.3.3]. The subject completed the base study of Study P170 prior to the availability of the extension 
study and died 122 days after the last dose of study medication. This event is not shown in [Table 2.5-
Type2DM0431A: 6] because this table does not include events that occurred more than 14 days after the 
last dose of study medication. This event is in [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 22, 24], which do not 
impose an upper limit on the day range.  
8.2.3.1.  Common Adverse Events  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of specific AEs were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and 
Metformin groups through Week 20 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 16, 17] and Week 54 [Table 
Assessment report  
EMA/603247/2020 
Page 19/26 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 18, 19]. Through Week 20, the only specific AEs for which the 95% CI for the 
between-group difference excluded 0, due to a higher incidence in either group, were blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased and headache [Figure 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 2]. Relative to the Metformin group, 
the incidence of blood creatine phosphokinase increased was higher, and the incidence of headache was 
lower in the Sita/Met FDC group. For both AEs, results through Week 54 were consistent with those 
through Week 20. However, through Week 54, there were no specific AEs for which the 95% CIs for the 
between-group differences excluded 0 [Figure 2.5-Type2DM0431A: 3].  
In both treatment groups, the AEs of blood creatine phosphokinase increased were mild or moderate in 
intensity, none led to discontinuation of study medication, and all resolved by the end of the study. 
Changes over time in blood creatine phosphokinase (referred to as serum creatine kinase in relevant 
laboratory tables) were small and not notably different between the 2 groups through Week 20 and Week 
54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 72, 73]. Results for specific AEs in Studies P170 and P289 
individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 12-3, 12-4] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 12-3, 
12-4] were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.

8.2.3.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of SAEs were similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups 
through Week 20 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 5] and Week 54 [Table 2.7.4- Type2DM0431A: 6]. In 
both groups, SAEs occurred across different SOCs and specific PTs with no notable patterns observed. As 
predefined in the study protocols, AEs associated with overdose of study medication were reported as 
SAEs. In the 2-study pool, the SAE of diarrhea in the Sita/Met FDC group and the SAEs of vomiting and 
upper abdominal pain (in the same subject) in the Metformin group met this predefined criterion. All SAEs 
associated with an overdose were considered related to study medication by the investigator [Table 
5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 26, 27]. No other SAEs were considered related to study medication. Results 
for SAEs in Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 12-8, 12-9] [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 12-7, 12-8] were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study 
pool. Narratives for subjects with SAEs in the Sita/Met FDC group are presented in [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: 16.2.7.2] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 16.2.7.2].

8.2.3.3.  Deaths  
One death, in a subject in the Sita/Met FDC group, was reported in the 2-study pool [Table 5.3.5.3.3-
Type2DM0431A: 22, 24]. The subject completed the base study of Study P170 prior to the availability of 
the extension study and died 122 days after the last dose of study medication. The cause of death was 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (AE preferred term of ‘death’). The death was 
considered not related to study medication by the investigator. A narrative for this event is in [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 16.2.7.2].  
8.2.3.4.  Other Significant Adverse Events  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication were low and 
similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 7] and 
Week 54 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 8]. With the exception of increased ALT in 3 subjects in the 
Metformin group, no AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication were reported in more than 1 
subject in either treatment group. Results for AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication in 
Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 12-10, 12-11] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P289MK0431A: Table 12-9, 12-10] were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.  
8.2.3.5.  Events of Special Interest  
Hypoglycemia Analyses of hypoglycemia results excluded data after initiation of glycemic rescue therapy 
and were performed separately for subjects not on versus on background insulin therapy.  
Subjects Not on Background Insulin Therapy  
In the 2-study pool in subjects not on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group through Week 20 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 9] and Week 54 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 10]. 
The incidences of severe hypoglycemia were low (≤3 subjects per group) and similar in the 2 groups. No 
episodes of severe hypoglycemia in either group required medical assistance. Results for hypoglycemia in 
subjects not on background insulin therapy in Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: Table 12-12, 12-13] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 12-11, 12-12] were generally 
consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.  
Subjects on Background Insulin Therapy  
In the 2-study pool in subjects on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group through Week 20 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 11] and Week 54 [Table 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 
12]. Only 1 subject in each group had severe hypoglycemia through Weeks 20 and 54 (both of whom are 
counted in the Week 20 and Week 54 tables). No episodes of severe hypoglycemia in either group 
required medical assistance. Results for hypoglycemia in subjects on background insulin therapy in 
Studies P170 and P289 individually [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 12-14, 12-15] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P289MK0431A: Table 12-13, 12-14] were generally consistent with those observed in the 2- study pool.  
Other Events of Special Interest  
In the 2-study pool, the incidence of abdominal pain was significantly lower in the Sita/Met FDC group 
than in the Metformin group through Week 20. The incidences of the other Tier 1 GI AEs (diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting) were similar in the 2 groups. Through Week 54, the incidences of Tier 1 GI AEs were 
similar in the 2 groups [Sec. 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 2.1.5.2]. In the 2-study pool, renal-related AEs 
occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin group through Week 20.

Results through Week 54 were similar in the 2 groups [Sec. 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 2.1.5.3]. In both 
treatment groups, renal-related AEs were limited to laboratory findings. AEs in the Sita/Met FDC group 
were generally reports of modest changes from baseline in laboratory values that remained stable despite 
continuing study medication. Some of these events were reports of creatinine renal clearance increased, a 
finding that may be due to the hyperfiltration often seen early in the course of T2DM. None of these AEs 
were serious, led to discontinuation of study medication, or were considered related to study medication. 
The incidences of infections were similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20 and 
Week 54 [Sec. 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 2.1.5.5]. The incidences of hypersensitivity AEs were similar in the 
Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20 and Week 54 [Sec. 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 2.1.5.4].  
8.2.4.  Laboratory, Vital Signs, and Other Observations Related to Safety  
8.2.4.1.  Laboratory Results  
In the 2-study pool, no notable differences in laboratory changes over time were observed between the 
Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Weeks 20 and 54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3- Type2DM0431A: 46] 
through [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 111]. In the 2-study pool, the proportions of subjects who met 
categorical PDLC criteria for laboratory endpoints were low and generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and 
Metformin groups through Week 20 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 44] and Week 54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-
Type2DM0431A: 45]. One subject in each group had an ALT value >10x ULN. The subject in the Sita/Met 
FDC group who met this criterion had a concurrent AE of hepatitis A [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 
12.3.2.2]. The subject in the Metformin group was withdrawn from the study due to an AE of 
transaminase elevation. No subjects in either group met the biochemical criteria for drug-induced liver 
injury as defined in the study protocols [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 16.1.1] [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P289MK0431A: 16.1.1]. Laboratory results in Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 12.3] and P289 
[Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 12.3] individually were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-
study pool.  
8.2.4.2.  Vital Signs  
In the 2-study pool, changes over time in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were not 
notably different between the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Weeks 20 and 54 [Table 
5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 112] through [Table 5.3.5.3.3- Type2DM0431A: 117]. Results for these 
endpoints in Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: 12.4.1] and P289 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: 
12.4.1] individually were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.  
8.2.4.3.  Indices of Adiposity  
In the 2-study pool, there were no notable differences between the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups in 
indices of adiposity (body weight, BMI, BMI percentile, waist circumference, and waist circumference-to-
height ratio) through Week 20 and Week 54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 118] through [Table 
5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 127]. Results for these endpoints in the Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: Table 14.3-99] through [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 14.3-108] and P289 [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-97] through [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-106] 
individually were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.  
8.2.4.4.  Growth and Development Endpoints  
In the 2-study pool, changes over time in height, height by standard deviation score, and growth velocity 
were not notably different between the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Weeks 20 and 54 
[Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 128] through [Table 5.3.5.3.3- Type2DM0431A: 137]. Results for these

endpoints in the Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 14.3- 109] through [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: Table 14.3-118] and P289 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-107] through [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-116] individually were generally consistent with those observed in the 
2-study pool. Tanner Staging In the 2-study pool, changes over time in Tanner Staging (ie, breasts 
[females only], genitalia [males only], and pubic hair) were not notably different between the Sita/Met 
FDC and Metformin groups through Weeks 20 and 54 [Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 138] through 
[Table 5.3.5.3.3-Type2DM0431A: 145]. Results for these endpoints in the Studies P170 [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P170MK0431A: Table 14.3- 119] through [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P170MK0431A: Table 14.3-126] and P289 [Ref. 
5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-117] through [Ref. 5.3.5.1: P289MK0431A: Table 14.3-124] 
individually were generally consistent with those observed in the 2-study pool.  
8.3.  Postmarketing Summary  
A cumulative analysis of postmarketing data, as of 31-DEC-2019, did not identify new safety findings for 
the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR FDC [Sec. 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 6]. The safety data in this analysis are 
consistent with the established safety profile, as described in the product label for the Sita/Met IR and 
Sita/Met XR FDCs. As of 31-DEC-2019, there have been 26,843 reports containing 63,771 AEs (50,690 
nonserious, 13,081 serious) in adult patients (≥18 years old) exposed to the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR 
FDC [Appendix 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 3]. Of the 13,081 SAEs, the most commonly reported PTs were 
pancreatitis (751 SAEs), diabetes mellitus inadequate control (415 SAEs), and pancreatic carcinoma (405 
SAEs). There have been 1256 reports (1525 events) of adult patients with fatal outcomes [Appendix 
2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 4]. The most commonly reported PTs with a fatal outcome were death (375 
events), myocardial infarction (142 events), and pancreatic carcinoma (131 events). Review of the 
postmarketing safety reports in adult patients did not reveal new safety findings. The Sita/Met IR and 
Sita/Met XR FDCs are not approved for treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients. As of 31-DEC-2019, there 
have been 17 reports containing 55 AEs (29 nonserious and 26 serious) in pediatric patients (<18 years 
old, including the age categories of fetus, neonate, infant, child, adolescent) exposed to the Sita/Met IR 
or Sita/Met XR FDC [Appendix 2.7.4-Type2DM0431A: 5]. These events were reported across multiple 
SOCs. Approximately 40% of the 55 AEs reported were in the Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications SOC, with most being reports of accidental or off-label administration of drug. Review of 
these postmarketing safety reports did not identify new safety findings in pediatric patients relative to 
adult patients. The Sponsor will continue to monitor the safety of the Sita/Met IR and Sita/Met XR FDCs 
through established routine pharmacovigilance processes.  
Summary of Safety  
There were 220 randomized and treated subjects in the 2-study pool (107 in the Sita/Met FDC group and 
113 in the Metformin group). The percentages of subjects who completed Week 20 and the percentages 
who completed Week 54, among the subset who continued beyond Week 20, were high in both groups 
(>90%).  
Adverse events overall 
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of AEs overall, drug-related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20.  
Serious adverse events 
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of SAEs were similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups 
through Week 20 and Week 54. In both groups, SAEs occurred across different SOCs and specific PTs 
with no notable patterns observed. 
One death, in the Sita/Met FDC group, was reported in the 2-study pool. The subject completed the base 
study of Study P170 prior to the availability of the extension study and died 122 days after the last dose 
of study medication.

Specific adverse events  
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased and the incidence of headache  
In the 2-study pool, the incidences of specific AEs were generally similar in the Sita/Met FDC and 
Metformin groups through Week 20 and Week 54. Relative to the Metformin group, the incidence of blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased was higher, and the incidence of headache was lower in the Sita/Met 
FDC group. For both AEs, results through Week 54 were consistent with those through Week 20. 
However, through Week 54, there were no specific AEs for which the 95% CIs for the between-group 
differences excluded 0.  
Hypoglycaemia 
In the 2-study pool in subjects not on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group. The incidences of severe hypoglycemia were low (≤3 subjects per group) and similar in the 2 
groups.  
In the 2-study pool in subjects on background insulin therapy, symptomatic, asymptomatic, and 
documented hypoglycemia for both blood glucose categories (≤70 mg/dL [≤3.9 mmol/L] and <54 mg/dL 
[<3.0 mmol/L]) generally occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the Metformin 
group through Week 20. Only 1 subject in each group had severe hypoglycemia through Weeks 20 and 
54.  
Other specific adverse events 
The incidences of the other Tier 1 GI AEs (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) were similar in the 2 groups. In 
the 2-study pool, renal-related AEs occurred more commonly in the Sita/Met FDC group than in the 
Metformin group through Week 20. Results through Week 54 were similar in the 2 groups. In both 
treatment groups, renal-related AEs were limited to laboratory findings. The incidences of infections were 
similar in the Sita/Met FDC and Metformin groups through Week 20 and Week 54 [Sec. 2.7.4-
Type2DM0431A: 2.1.5.5]. The incidences of hypersensitivity AEs were similar. One subject in each group 
had an ALT value >10x ULN. In the 2-study pool, there were no notable differences between the Sita/Met 
FDC and Metformin groups in indices of adiposity In the 2-study pool, changes over time in height, height 
by standard deviation score, and growth velocity were not notably different. A cumulative analysis of 
postmarketing data, as of 31-DEC-2019, did not identify new safety findings for the Sita/Met IR or 
Sita/Met XR FDC 
Conclusion of Safety Results  
Safety of treatment with sitagliptin added on to metformin IR or XR (as the Sita/Met IR or Sita/Met XR 
FDC) in pediatric subjects with T2DM for 54 weeks was generally similar to that in adults. However, in 
patients with and without insulin, sitagliptin was associated with hypoglycaemia. Sitagliptin was not 
associated with the incidence of severe hypoglycemia. 
Rapporteur’s assessment: 
The increased risk of hypoglycaemia should be added to the text of the SmPC. In addition, several other 
changes in the text are necessary (in SmPC). The SmPC is amended as requested within procedure. Issue 
resolved. 
The information with respect to the results of Studies P170 and P289 is also relevant for the SmPC of the 
monoproduct sitagliptin. The applicant is requested to discuss whether adding this information to the 
SmPC of the monoproduct is warranted.  
The applicant believes that further modification to the sitagliptin SmPC is not warranted. The sitagliptin 
SmPC has been updated recently to include a description of the pediatric clinical study of sitagliptin as 
initial oral therapy, but no extension of indications to the pediatric population. Unlike the observation in 
Assessment report

the pooled analysis of the data from Studies P170, and P289, in Study P083 (the Phase III study of 
sitagliptin as initial oral therapy in pediatric patients 10-17years old, with T2DM) imbalances in the 
incidences of hypoglycemia, with higher incidences in the sitagliptin group compared to the placebo group 
(over Weeks 0-20) or to the placebo/metformin group (over Weeks 0-54), were not observed in patients 
who were not on background insulin. The increased incidence of hypoglycemia observed in the sitagliptin 
group in patients who were on background insulin in Study P083 was consistent with the data in adult 
patients. The CHMP’s assessment of the sitagliptin application (WS-1727 / P46-040) was therefore in 
keeping with the sponsor’s conclusion that the profile of side effects (including the incidence of 
hypoglycemia) that had been observed in P083 was comparable to that observed in adults. Hence, the 
sponsor believes that the recent CHMP-approved sitagliptin product information sufficiently addresses the 
benefit/risk in the indicated population.  
The applicant’s justification is acceptable. Issue resolved. 
9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, are updated to include data from the pooled 
analysis of paediatric studies P170 (sitagliptin/metformin) and P289 (sitagliptin/metformin extended 
release). The package leaflet is revised accordingly. 
Changes are also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.1.

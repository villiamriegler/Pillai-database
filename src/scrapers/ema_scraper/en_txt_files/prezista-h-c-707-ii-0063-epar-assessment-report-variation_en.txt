2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The current PREZISTA Product Information (PI) states that darunavir (DRV) can only be administered in 
combination with low-dose ritonavir (rtv) as a pharmacokinetic enhancer (booster): “PREZISTA, 
co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult and paediatric 
patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight (see section 4.2).” 
Tybost, (Cobicistat, COBI) has been registered in September 2013 to be co-administered at a dose of 150 
mg as an alternative pharmacokinetic enhancer of DRV 800 mg once daily as part of antiretroviral (ARV) 
combination therapy in HIV-1 infected adults. 
As a consequence, the MAH applies for a type II variation to include the use of Tybost (Cobicistat, COBI) in 
the SmPC of Prezista, and proposed to add to section 4.1 “PREZISTA, co-administered with cobicistat is 
indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients (see section 4.2).” 
In addition, modifications to section 4.2 and all other sections of the SmPC are proposed to include the use 
of COBI next to that of ritonavir as a booster of DRV.  
As such, the SmPC of DRV will reflect that of COBI and allows combination with COBI once daily as an 
alternative to rtv once daily and in the same indication as the one that is already approved for PREZISTA, i.e. 
for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve adult subjects and 
treatment-experienced adult subjects with no DRV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), and with 
plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell count ≥100x106 cells/L. 
This type II variation is built on information which has already been reviewed as part of the existing Prezista 
supplemented with pivotal information to support the use of COBI as alternative booster for DRV: studies 
GS-US-216-0115 and GS-US-216-0130. The latter study reports are included in this type II variation, in line 
with the advice obtained from the EMA on 26 September 2013, and have been partly reviewed by CHMP as 
part of the COBI MAA. 
In addition, an application of a new Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) of DRV/COBI is reviewed for the same 
indication as requested for Prezista.  
All study data of GS-US-216-0115  and week 48 study results of GS-US-216-0130  that are now presented 
in the current AR have already been assessed in the application of the FDC DRV/COBI. 
The CHMP proposes to bring all SmPCs in line and to incorporate week 48 efficacy data of study 
GS-US-216-0130 and week 48 safety data in section 5.1 and section 4.8, respectively, of the SmPC of 
Prezista, Tybost and the new FDC DRV/COBI once the concerns have been adequately addressed in the FDC 
DRV/COBI procedure.  
2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects  
As indicated, for this type II variation reference is made to the application of Tybost and is built on 
information which has already been reviewed as part of the existing Prezista eCTD, supplemented with 
pivotal information to support the use of COBI as alternative booster for DRV: studies GS-US-216-0115 and 
GS-US-216-0130.  The results of these studies will be here addressed only shortly, as these 2 studies have 
been assessed before within the context of COBI MAA.

Study GS-US-216-0115 
GS-US-216-0115 was an open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover Phase 1 study in 33 healthy subjects 
to evaluate, under fed conditions, the oral bioavailability of DRV 800 mg when co-administered as single 
agents with either COBI 150 mg or rtv 100 mg, both of which are PK enhancers of DRV.  
The DRV AUC24h and Cmax, were similar for DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily and DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily (both regimens co-administered as single agents); the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
least square (LS) means ratios were contained within the 80.00% to 125.00% bounds. The DRV Ctau was 
lower in the COBI group compared to the rtv group (mean [SD]: 1,333 [890] ng/ml versus 1,867 [1,555] 
ng/ml), but this is not expected to be clinically relevant based on  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD) analyses of the effect of DRV exposure on virologic response in studies TMC114-C211 and 
TMC114-C229 with DRV/rtv. 
Table PK 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters [mean (%CV)] of DRV following multiple-dose 
administration with Cobicistat (GS-9350) 150 mg once daily or RTV 100 mg once daily. 
This study was also submitted for the application of Cobicistat and will not be discussed here in detail. 
Bioequivalent DRV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) were observed following once-daily dosing of DRV 800 mg 
+ Cobicistat (GS-9350) 150 mg versus DRV 800 mg + RTV 100 mg. The geometric least-squares (GLS) 
mean ratio for Ctau was lower because of unexpected increasing DRV concentrations at the 24-hour time 
point in the DRV+RTV treatment. DRV predose concentrations (C0h) following observed, multiple doses of 
study drug at steady-state were equivalent for both treatments and > 37-fold above the protein-adjusted 
EC50 for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL). Collectively, the data indicate that cobicistat 150 mg sufficiently boosts 
DRV similarly to RTV 100 mg.  
The combination of darunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150mg was therefore considered acceptable. 
Study GS-US-216-130 
Study GS-US-216-130, is an open-label, single arm, multi-centre, study that evaluates the safety and 
efficacy of a regimen of DRV+COBI (800 mg + 150 mg q.d. with food) plus 2 fully active NRTIs in HIV-1 
infected, ARV treatment-naive and treatment- experienced adult subjects with no DRV RAMs (see for further

description the clinical part of this assessment report). Pharmacokinetics were evaluated for DRV, COBI, 
emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) (dosed as Truvada 200mg/300mg) based on intensive sampling 
between Weeks 2 and 8 in a subset of subjects (n = 60) at selected sites (PK sub-study) and a single 
pharmacokinetic blood sample at all visits through Week 48 is planned for all subjects for patient population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained form 60 subjects (57 treatment-naïve and 3 treatment-experienced) in 
the sub-study and 301 subjects (284 treatment-naïve and 17 treatment-experienced) in the overall study. 
The steady-state DRV pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of DRV+COBI are shown in 
table PK 2 and for COBI in table PK 3. 
Table PK 2. Summary of darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in the PK sub-study (PK 
sub-study analysis set). 
Table PK 3. Summary of cobicistat pharmacokinetic parameters in the PK sub-study (PK 
sub-study analysis set). 
The results for darunavir were in line with those observed in study GS-US-216-0115, although in this study 
the Ctau and C0h values were comparable, while in study -115 C0h was higher than Ctau. Most important is 
that the lowest darunavir plasma concentrations are comparable. 
The results for COBI were in line with those observed in study GS-US-236-0102, -0103, and -0104, i.e. 
historical data in HIV-1 infected patients, steady-state COBI PK parameters after once-daily administration 
of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild) in the intensive PK 
sub-studies (see table below).

As can be observed, the Ctau values of COBI in study GS-US-216-130 were considerably lower than in the 
combined data used for comparison (i.e. 32.8 vs 49.1 ng/ml). The overall exposure data for DRV with COBI 
are in line with previous obtained data of DRV boosted with rtv (see below) and do not indicate that the 
observed lower Ctau for COBI may affect DRV exposure. However it cannot be excluded that due to low COBI 
Ctau values, also DRV exposure is lower and therefore the likelihood that patients fail increase. This has 
been raised as a concern in the Tybost/Prezista FDC application and is still under assessment.  
The steady-state emtricitabine pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of DRV+COBI are 
shown in table PK 4.  
Table PK 4. Summary of emtricitabine pharmacokinetic parameters in the PK sub-study (PK 
sub-study analysis set). 
Considering the metabolic pathway of emtricitabine, it is expected that the pharmacokinetics are not 
influenced by DRV/COBI. The results are in line with those indicated for Emtriva, i.e. in 20 HIV infected 
subjects receiving 200 mg emtricitabine daily as hard capsules, steady-state plasma emtricitabine peak 
concentrations (Cmax), trough concentrations (Cmin) and area under the plasma concentration time curve 
over a 24-hour dosing interval (AUC) were 1.8±0.7 μg/ml, 0.09±0.07 μg/ml and 10.0±3.1 μg•h/ml, 
respectively. Steady-state trough plasma concentrations reached levels approximately 4-fold above the in 
vitro IC90 values for anti-HIV activity. 
The steady-state tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of DRV+COBI are shown in 
table PK 5.

Page 7/54 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Table PK 5. Summary of tenofovir pharmacokinetic parameters in the PK sub-study (PK 
sub-study analysis set). 
From study TMC114-C124 it is known that co-administration of DRV/COBI with tenofovir may increase 
concentrations of tenofovir (inhibition of P-gp) (see table below). 
These data are more or less in line with the steady-state mean tenofovir Cmax, AUCtau and Ctrough (mean 
± SD) following multiple doses of Stribild in HIV-1 infected subjects, i.e. 0.45 ± 0.16 µg/ml, 4.4 ± 2.2 µg 
•h/ml, and 0.1 ± 0.08 µg/ml, respectively.   
The data from study -130 are lower than reported in the interaction study and for Stribild, however are 
comparable to the Reference arm in study C124 (tenofovir only). As such, the results of study -130 for 
tenofovir are not raising a concern. 
Patient population pharmacokinetic analyses 
Based on a previously developed population PK model for DRV, an updated model was developed using a 
subset of richly sampled PK data collected in study GS-US-216-0130 (i.e., the PK sub-study). Model 
parameters were then re-estimated using the rich sampled data available from the Week 24 dataset. All 
subjects had sparse sampling data for DRV at Week 24, and some subjects had sparse sampling data beyond 
Week 24. The final model was then used together with those sparse and rich sampled data for the Bayesian 
feedback analysis to estimate the individual PK parameters (AUC24h and C0h) of DRV. A total of 53 subjects 
were included in the initial model build dataset, with 55 subjects included in the parameter re-estimation 
dataset. All subjects with available PK data (298 subjects) were included in the Week-24 Bayesian feedback 
analysis dataset. 
The model build and Bayesian feedback analysis were performed using mixed-effects modelling methods, as 
implemented in NONMEM (version VII level 2.0). Models were fitted to untransformed data using the 
first-order conditional estimation method in NONMEM with the INTERACTION option. For the empirical Bayes 
estimation, MAXEVAL was set to 0.

The best model to describe the PK of DRV was a 2-compartment disposition model with a sequential 
zero-order-first-order absorption. The effects of total daily dose and AAG on CL/F were retained from the 
original model. The relative bioavailability term was corrected for the commercial formulation (compared to 
the tablet used in previous clinical studies), and was fixed to a value of 1.18, as determined in the previously 
developed model. This allowed CL/F and central volume of distribution (Vc/F) to be directly compared with 
previous estimates. 
Intersubject variability terms were included on the disposition parameters CL/F, Vc/F, and 
intercompartmental clearance (CLp/F), with an ISV term also included on the zero-order absorption duration 
parameter D1. The ISV term on the peripheral volume of distribution (Vp/F) was fixed to 55.7 %CV, a value 
previously determined for DRV. The median prediction error for the model was 2.61%, and the median 
absolute prediction error was 7.43%. The model was therefore considered acceptable for determination of 
individual DRV exposure metrics in the Bayesian feedback analysis. Parameter estimates for the final model 
are shown in table PK 6. No significant covariate was identified so that the final model was the same as the 
base model. 
Table PK 6. Final population PK model parameter estimates of DRV following multiple-dose 
administration of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily co-administered as single agents in study 
GS-US-216-0130. 
There were a total of 2,364 PK samples available for the Bayesian feedback analysis. The mean (range) 
number of PK samples per subject was 7.9 (1 to 19). The final model was fitted to the Week-24 Bayesian 
feedback dataset with parameters fixed to those obtained during the estimation process. Plots of observed 
versus population predicted plasma concentrations and observed versus individual predicted plasma 
concentrations of DRV for the Bayesian feedback at Week 24 were similar to the plots for the final model and 
showed no obvious bias (figure PK 1). However, the distribution of observations around the line of unity 
when compared to individual predicted concentrations was wider for the final model, suggesting that the 
model was less precise when applied to this dataset. The conditional weighted residuals were evenly 
distributed, with no skewness. A visual predictive check showed that the model adequately described the 
data (figure PK 2). 
The median prediction error and median absolute prediction error for the model when fitted to the Bayesian 
feedback dataset were -1.83% and 17.3%, respectively. This indicated that the model was suitable for 
determination of individual DRV exposure metrics.

Further covariates that were assessed for their potential to explain variability in the PK of DRV included age, 
height, weight, body surface area, body mass index, creatinine clearance, sex, and race.  Graphical analyses 
between individual parameters and these covariates suggested that age and sex may explain some of the 
variability in CL/F, although no significant covariate could be identified during the model building process. 
Similar findings were also observed for Vp/F.

It is commented by CHMP that the model developed in this analysis was similar to the previously developed 
model based on DRV/RTV, with the primary difference associated with the absorption process. The previous 
model included a single first-order parameter to describe absorption, whereas the model presented in this 
analysis described absorption via a sequential zero-order-first-order process. In addition, the BSV term on 
KA in the previous model was replaced with a BSV term on D1. Finally, the correlation between Vc/F and KA 
in the previous model was removed. Parameter estimates for the updated model in this analysis, together 
with the previously developed model using data with DRV boosted RTV, are shown in the table below. All 
fixed effects parameters were similar, excluding Vc/F, which was estimated to be 35.6 l in this analysis 
compared to 122 l in the previous analysis. In case the prior model was fitted to the model development 
dataset, Vc/F was estimated at 37.1 l, suggesting that the final estimate obtained was driven by the data, 
rather than the model (possibly due to the fact that the data were modelled at steady-state, which is in 
contrast to the original model development). 
Comparison of parameter estimates between prior and current models. 
CLINT /F = intrinsic clearance, TDD = total daily dose, AAG = alpha-1 acid glycoprotein concentration, Vc/F 
= central volume of distribution, CLp/F = inter-compartmental clearance, Vp/F = peripheral volume of 
distribution, KA = absorption rate constant, FREL = relative bioavailability, D1 = zero-order duration of 
input, R = correlation between parameters, RUV = residual unexplained variability, * = parameter fixed, 
BSV = between subject variability, SE = standard error of the estimate, CV% = percent coefficient of

The predicted pharmacokinetics for darunavir are in line with those observed in study C211 and

2.2.1.  Discussion 
Study was 0115 was also submitted for the application of Cobicistat and hence is not discussed in detail in 
current variation. 
Bioequivalent DRV exposures (AUCtau and Cmax) were observed following once-daily dosing of DRV 800 mg 
+ Cobicistat (GS-9350) 150 mg versus DRV 800 mg + RTV 100 mg. The geometric least-squares (GLS) 
mean ratio for Ctau was lower because of unexpected increasing DRV concentrations at the 24-hour time 
point in the DRV+RTV treatment. DRV predose concentrations (C0h) following observed, multiple doses of 
study drug at steady-state were equivalent for both treatments and > 37-fold above the protein-adjusted 
EC50 for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL). Collectively, the data indicate that cobicistat 150 mg sufficiently boosts 
DRV similarly to RTV 100 mg.  
The combination of darunavir 800 mg and cobicistat 150mg was therefore considered acceptable. 
Regarding study 0130, the results for darunavir were in line with those observed in study GS-US-216-0115, 
although in this study the Ctau and C0h values were comparable, while in study -115 C0h was higher than 
Ctau. Most important is that the lowest darunavir plasma concentrations are comparable. 
The results for COBI were in line with those observed in study GS-US-236-0102, -0103, and -0104, i.e. 
historical data in HIV-1 infected patients, steady-state COBI PK parameters after once-daily administration 
of elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild) in the intensive PK 
sub-studies (see table below). 
As can be observed, the Ctau values of COBI in study GS-US-216-130 were considerably lower than in the 
combined data used for comparison (i.e. 32.8 vs 49.1 ng/ml). The overall exposure data for DRV with COBI 
are in line with previous obtained data of DRV boosted with rtv and do not indicate that the observed lower 
Ctau for COBI may affect DRV exposure. However it could not be excluded that due to low COBI Ctau values, 
also DRV exposure is lower and therefore the result in higher likelihood that patients’ therapy fail (see 
further discussion under “efficacy”) . This issue has also been raised as a concern in the Tybost/Prezista FDC 
application. 
With respect to patient population pharmacokinetic analyses, as discussed in detail, the model developed in 
this analysis was similar to the previously developed model based on DRV/RTV, with the primary difference 
associated with the absorption process.

2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
With DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily, similar DRV exposures are targeted as with the reference treatment 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily that was used in the  
TMC114-C211 (ARTEMIS) study in treatment naïve patients and  
TMC114 C229 (ODIN) study in treatment experienced patients,  
With similar DRV exposures comparable outcomes in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adults and in 
ART-experienced adults (without DRV RAMs and with plasma HIV-1 RNA <100,000 copies/mL and CD4+ cell 
count ≥ 100x106 cells/L) can be expected of DRV/COBI, as well. 
ART-naïve subjects: DRV/RTV 800/100 mg once daily 
The randomized, active-controlled, open-label Phase 3 study TMC114-C211 compared DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
once daily (n=343) with LPV/rtv 800/200 mg per day (given as a twice daily or as a once daily regimen) 
(n=346). Both arms used a fixed background regimen consisting of TDF 300 mg once daily and FTC 200 mg 
once daily.

ART-experienced subjects: DRV/RTV 800/100 mg once daily 
Study TMC114-C229 was a randomized, open label study comparing DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily 
(n=294) to DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily (n=296) in HIV 1 infected treatment experienced subjects 
with screening genotype resistance testing showing no DRV RAMs, a viral load of >1,000 HIV 1 RNA 
copies/mL and a CD4+ cell count >50x106 cells/L at screening. Both arms used an optimized 
background regimen consisting of ≥ 2 NRTIs selected by the investigator.

DRV/COBI 800/150 mg Once Daily 
In the ongoing, single-arm, multicenter, Phase 3b study GS-US-216-0130, n=313 HIV-1 infected adult 
subjects (295 ART-naïve and 18 ART experienced with no DRV RAMs) are treated for a period of at least 48 
weeks with DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily, and 2 fully active NRTIs. 
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg plus 2 NRTIs in the 
studied population through 24 weeks of treatment. The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and 
tolerability of the regimen through 48 weeks of treatment,  the efficacy of the regimen as determined by a 
virologic response of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 of treatment, and the change from 
baseline in CD4+ cell counts at Weeks 24 and 48. 
The overall median (range) duration of exposure to study medication was 31.4 weeks (0.1 to 42.4 weeks), 
with a median exposure of 31.9 weeks in the treatment-naïve subjects and a median exposure of 26.6 weeks 
in treatment-experienced subjects. 
The majority of subjects received TDF-based ARV medication during the study (99.7% of treatment-naïve 
subjects and 94.4% of treatment-experienced subjects) 
The majority of subjects were male (90.2% in the treatment naïve subgroup, 72.2% in the 
treatment-experienced subgroup) and most were white (59.7% and 61.1%, respectively) or black (34.2% 
and 38.9%, respectively). The median age was 34 years (range 18 to 72 years) for treatment-naïve subjects 
and 48 years (range 22 to 69 years) for treatment-experienced subjects. 
For subjects in the treatment-naïve subgroup, the mean baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 copies/mL, 
the mean baseline CD4+ cell count was 378x106 cells/L and 15.9% of subjects had a CD4+ cell count ≤
200x106 cells/L. The majority of subjects (81.7%) had asymptomatic HIV-1 infection, 8.8% of subjects had 
symptomatic HIV 1 infection, and 9.5% were diagnosed with AIDS. 
The baseline disease characteristics in the treatment-experienced subgroup reflected a more advanced 
stage of HIV 1 disease, the mean (SD) baseline log10 HIV-1 RNA value was 4.8 (0.76) copies/mL, the mean 
baseline CD4+ cell count was 198 (214)x106 cells/L and 66.7% of subjects had a CD4+ cell count ≤
200x106 cells/L. The median number of years since HIV diagnosis was 8.5 years (range 2 to 24 years).

Up to Week 24, the mean percentage adherence to the prescribed DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg pills 
was 99.2% in treatment-naïve subjects and 97.3% in treatment-experienced subjects. 
In the treatment-naïve subgroup, virologic response at Week 24 was reached by 247 subjects (83.7%; 
95% CI: 79.0% to 87.8%). There were 29 subjects (9.8%) with virologic failure. Of the 17 subjects 
with virologic failure due to HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 24, 14 were still receiving study 
medication at Week 36 with HIV-1 RNA levels available in 10 subjects. Of these 10 subjects, 6 had 
HIV-1 RNA levels <50 copies/mL. 
Few treatment-experienced subjects were enrolled in the study (n=18), and virologic response at Week 24 
in this subgroup was reached by 11 subjects (61.1%; 95% CI 35.7% to 82.7%).

In HIV-infected treatment-naïve subjects of study TMC114-C211 there was no apparent relationship 
between DRV exposure and virologic response. Similarly, in treatment-naïve subjects receiving DRV/COBI 
there was no apparent relationship between the decrease in log10 plasma viral load from baseline at 
Week 24 and DRV exposure.  
In treatment experienced patients receiving DRV/RTV the virologic response was not related to DRV 
exposure, as well, although unexpectedly higher DRV exposures seemed to result in smaller decreases of 
viral load. In DRV-COBI the number of 18 patients was too limited to draw conclusions. 
Resistance 
In the Week-192 analysis of the TMC114-C211 study, the proportion of virologic failures (based on viral load 
≥50 copies/mL; ITT – TLOVR non-virologic failure [non-VF] censored) in the group of subjects receiving 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily was 16.0%. None of the developing mutations in 4 subjects with PI RAMs 
were primary (ie, major) PI mutations. . In 4 virologic failures a maximum of 2 developing (IAS-USA) NRTI 
RAMs were observed. 
In the Week-48 analysis of the TMC114-C229 study, the proportion of virologic failures (based on viral load 
≥50 copies/mL; ITT – TLOVR non-VF censored) in the DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily group was 22.1%, 
from whom 7 subjects (12%) developed (IAS-USA) PI RAMs. One virologic failure developed primary 
(ie, major) PI mutations, which included 3 DRV RAMs, resulting in decreased susceptibility to DRV. Four 
(6.7%) virologic failures developed 1 or 2 (IAS-USA) NRTI RAMs with 3 from 4 acquiring decreased 
susceptibility to a NRTI included in the treatment regimen. Of the viruses isolated from subjects receiving 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily and experiencing virologic failure in the TMC114-C229 study, 98% 
remained susceptible to DRV after treatment.

DRV-COBI: Of the 313 subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study medication DRV/COBI 800/150 mg 
once daily, 10 met the criteria for post baseline resistance analysis: 5 treatment-naïve subjects (1 confirmed 
suboptimal virologic response, 2 virologic rebounds, and 2 discontinuations with HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL 
at last visit) and 5 treatment-experienced subjects (1 confirmed suboptimal virologic response, 2 virologic 
rebounds, and 2 discontinuations with HIV-1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL at last visit). No genotypic and 
phenotypic resistance development was seen in the ART-naïve subjects. One ART-experienced subject had 
developed a DRV RAM at position I84 as a mixture with WT (I84I/V) without consequences for phenotypic 
resistance testing. No other PI RAMs or NRTI RAMs were recorded.  
2.3.1.  Supplementary analyses 
1. Treatment outcomes for treatment-naive subjects by baseline viral load category at W 24-48 (- 0130) 
Treatment outcomes in study GS-US-216-0130 for treatment-naive subjects by baseline viral load category 
in the FDA-defined snapshot analysis, both at Week 24 and Week 48, are presented in next Table. 
While in the Week-24 analysis, there was a 10% difference in the response rates between subjects with a 
baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/mL (87.9%) versus subjects with a baseline viral load >100,000 
copies/mL (77.9%), this difference was only 2.7% in the Week-48 analysis. The response rate increased in 
the subjects with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL from 77.9% to 81.1%, because additional subjects 
achieved virologic response between Week 24 and Week 48. Some subjects with a high viral load at baseline 
need a period longer than 24 weeks to reach undetectable levels, and therefore may still become a 
responder between Week 24 and Week 48. 
Similar results were seen in study TMC114-C211 where at the Week-24 time point (Week-48 analysis), there 
was 18.3% difference in the response rates (time to loss of virologic response imputation method used) 
between subjects with a baseline viral load ≤100,000 copies/mL (85.8%) versus subjects with a baseline 
viral load >100,000 copies/mL (67.5%). This difference was only 6.3% at the Week-48 time point (Week-48 
analysis) due to an increase in response rate from 67.5% at Week 24 to 79.5% at Week 48 in the subjects 
with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL. 
Table E7 
When looking at the darunavir (DRV) predose plasma concentration (C0h) based on population 
pharmacokinetics, subjects with baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL versus subjects with baseline viral 
load >100,000 copies/mL who were virologic failures at Week 48 had similar exposure (Figure 1 and Figure 
2). Also in earlier studies with DRV boosted with low-dose ritonavir (rtv), there was no relevant relationship 
between DRV C0h and virologic outcome (see Week-48 results from studies TMC114-C211 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 19/54 
  
  
 
TMC114-C229 in Module 5.3.5.1). Descriptive statistics for DRV C0h by response are provided in Appendix 
1 and Appendix 2.  
The Week-48 population pharmacokinetics of the treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adults treated with 
DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once daily of the Phase 3b study TMC114-C211 showed that subjects both with 
baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL and with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL who were  
virologic failures had similar C0h compared to subjects who responded (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Furthermore, 
DRV C0h was similar between subjects who failed virologically with baseline viral ≤ 100,000 copies/mL 
versus those who failed virologically with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL load (Figure 1 and Figure 
2).

2. DRV trough levels will exceed its EC50 of both wild type virus or PI resistant HIV-1 strains in case of switch 
from EFV-containing regimens to DRV/COBI. 
As indicated in Table below, overall, the DRV exposures (C0h, area under the plasma concentration time 
curve [AUC]) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects are comparable when 
boosted by cobicistat (COBI) versus rtv, and the efficacy and safety findings from study GS-US-216-0130 
were consistent with those from registration studies with rtv-boosted DRV (see Module 2.7.4/Summary of 
Clinical Safety dated 13 December 2013). 
Table E8 
Furthermore, DRV plasma concentrations when boosted by COBI are anticipated to be on the plateau of the 
concentration-response curve and are far above the protein-binding corrected 50% effective concentration 
(EC50): the mean DRV C0h in HIV-infected subjects in study GS-US-216-0130 was >37-fold above the 
protein binding corrected EC50 for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL). The EC50 of protease inhibitor (PI) resistant 
virus is not considered relevant for the patient population treated with DRV/COBI as patients should be 
either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced with no DRV resistance-associated mutations (ie, fully 
susceptible to DRV and all or almost all PIs). In none of the registrational studies, including study 
GS-US-216-0130 with boosted DRV, there has been any indication of a relevant exposure-response 
relationship for DRV pharmacokinetics. 
In the clinical setting where patients would switch from an efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen to DRV/COBI, 
there will be residual inductive effects of EFV on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes during the first weeks 
after the switch. For COBI, the impact on the exposure has been shown to be only modest: 10 to 20% lower 
COBI AUC was observed in 1 to 2 weeks following switch from Atripla (ATR) to STRIBILD® (STB) in Phase 1 
study GS-US-236-0120.4 
For DRV, any initial lower DRV exposure after a switch from an EFV-based regimen has not been 
quantitatively evaluated. It is anticipated to be no more than 15 to 30% during a limited time period, as the 
decrease in DRV exposure when DRV/rtv was given concomitantly with EFV was 31% for minimum plasma 
concentration (Cmin), and 13% for AUC. Overall, and despite the lack of data to allow for a detailed 
quantitative assessment of the effects, given that COBI boosted DRV concentrations are well above the 
wild-type EC50 as stated above (>37-fold), it is anticipated that DRV concentrations would still be well 
above this value even in the presence of some residual CYP3A inducing effect after a switch from an 
EFV-based regimen.  
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 21/54 
  
  
 
 
The antiviral activity of DRV during the switch period is also bolstered by the activity of the 
nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor background regimen, which is not impacted by CYP3A 
induction. Furthermore, in subjects switching from EFV for reasons other than virologic failure, although 
initially after switch the DRV exposure could be somewhat lower than that in the absence of a preceding EFV 
treatment, an impact of this on antiviral activity would be expected to be offset by the activity of the 
remaining EFV concentrations during the first weeks after switch, as shown for other antivirals in a switch 
scenario,1 due to the long EFV elimination half-life of ~50 hours (mean EFV concentrations were above the 
90% inhibitory concentration for 5 weeks following switch from ATR to STB in Phase 1 study 
GS-US-236-01204 and also in a switch study to Complera3). 
In Table E9, the antiretroviral (ARV) use just before switching to DRV/COBI is shown for the 18 
treatment-experienced subjects either failing or responding at Week 48 in study GS-US-216-0130. Of the 9 
treatment-experienced subjects who failed at Week 48 (snapshot), 1 subject had stopped EFV 30 days prior 
to when DRV/COBI was started. As the CYP3A inducing effect of EFV is anticipated to have largely reverted 
within 30 days prior to the start of DRV/COBI treatment, this is therefore not considered a relevant case for 
discussion on a possible pharmacokinetic interaction. 
An equal number of 3 subjects of responders (n=3/9) as well as failures (n=3/9) used EFV prior to switching 
to DRV/COBI. These data suggest that there is no clear effect of prior EFV use on outcome in the present 
study, but should be interpreted with caution as the sample size for the cases is very small. 
Based on the above considerations, the Applicant is of the opinion that the clinical risk is limited in terms of 
efficacy in switching from an EFV-containing regimen to a DRV/COBI-containing regimen. The plasma 
concentrations of DRV in addition to remaining EFV plasma concentrations and/or those of the background 
ARVs are anticipated to provide sufficient antiviral activity throughout the switch period.

2.3.2.  Discussion 
Bioequivalence of DRV when boosted by either RTV or COBI has been demonstrated and as such COBI has 
been registered as a pharmaco-enhancer of DRV. 
Furthermore, the application for a fixed dose combination of DRV/COBI has been submitted in 2013 based 
on the same PK studies and on study GS-US-216-0130. 
When boosted by either ritonavir or COBI, DRV achieved viral suppression < 50 copies/ml in treatment naïve 
patients in either 81.6% (data ARTEMIS study) or 83.7% (data GS-US-216-0130) at week 24. 
The efficacy data at week 24 of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg QD mostly in 295 treatment naïve patients do not 
show major concerns regarding virologic response, virologic failures, or development of RAMs. About the 
treatment experienced patients not much can be said since the included number was low (n=18). 
The MAH has included a sufficient number of treatment naïve patients (almost 300 treatment-naïve 
patients) to determine safety of DRV when boosted by COBI (see below in the section of Safety), and also 
the efficacy can be deducted from this study. However, the follow up period of 24 weeks is relatively short 
for the evaluation of efficacy in patients with high baseline viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml). This may be 
relevant since COBI boosts DRV to a lesser extent than RTV (Ctau ~30% lower).  Ctau of DRV was not 
considered relevant for antiviral activity in the total population in the studies that evaluated DRV in 
combination with RTV, but Ctau of DRV was not presented separately for the subjects with high baseline viral 
load who failed versus those with low baseline viral load who experienced virologic failure in the pivotal 
studies of DRV/RTV. The MAH was requested to clarify.  From the additional analyses provided, there seems 
a clear difference in response between subjects with baseline viral load ≤ 100,000 copies/mL versus subjects 
with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL at 24 weeks, which could indicate reduced efficacy.  Based on 
the response of the MAH it is concluded that this is not explained by lower DRV concentrations in these 
patients. Considering the Week 48 response, the difference in response between with baseline viral load ≤
100,000 copies/mL versus subjects with baseline viral load >100,000 copies/mL is smaller as the number of 
virological failures has decreased in those with baseline viral load > 100,000 copies (i.e. the number of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL). Similar results were seen in study TMC114-C211, in which the 
difference also decreased with time. These results indicate that patients with higher viral loads at start 
therapy possibly respond slower. The provided C0h data for the different subgroups (<100k, >100k, with or 
without failure) do not differ substantially between subgroups. As such, no evidence for a reduced activity of 
DRV in combination with COBI in higher baseline viral loads was found, which may be due to a lower C0h if 
DRV is boosted by COBI versus when boosted by RTV. Therefore, no limitation or restriction in 4.1 based on 
baseline viral load in the SmPC needs to be incorporated. 
This lower exposure of DRV may also be relevant in treatment experienced patients switching from EFV to 
DRV when EFV concentrations are decreasing and DRV exposures are not fully achieved due to CYP3A4 
induction by EFV in the first weeks after cessation of EFV and also COBI exposures are lower due to CYP3A4 
induction. This may result in lack of antiviral activity after switch or only activity of the remaining backbone 
(e.g. tenofovir and emtricitabine).  The MAH was requested to comment whether DRV trough levels will 
exceed its EC50 of both wild type virus or PI resistant HIV-1 strains in case of switch from EFV-containing 
regimens to DRV/COBI. 
In their response they highlighted that the mean DRV C0h in HIV-infected subjects in study 
GS-US-216-0130 was >37-fold above the protein binding corrected EC50 for wild-type virus (55 ng/mL); as 
it is anticipated that the DRV exposure will be lowered no more than 15-30% the EC50 is still likely to be 
exceeded.  
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 24/54 
  
  
GS-US-216-0130 included 18 treatment experienced subjects. Of these, 6 patients used EFV prior to 
switching to DRV/COBI of whom 3 (out of 9) achieved virological response, and 3 patients did not. It cannot 
be concluded whether prior exposure to EFV did affect the outcome in this study based upon these small 
number; as half of patients who used EFV prior to switching to DRV/cobi achieved virological response is 
reassuring – however two patients did not which could be due to the CYP3A effect.  
Two categories of patients who will switch from efavirenz to DRV/COBI based regimens must be considered: 
1) patients intolerant to efavirenz but with virologic suppression, and 2) patients failing on efavirenz without 
virologic suppression. For the first category the concentration of DRV is far above the EC50 regardless of 
waning induction by EFV. In combination with the effect of the backbone ARVs DRV concentration will be 
sufficient to maintain virologic suppression. The second patient category has been studied in the ODIN study 
with convincing results if no DRV-associated mutations are present and viral load < 100,000 copies/ml. 
Although the MAH did not provide data from this particular subgroup of virologic failures on EFV the efficacy 
in the once daily DRV arm in the ODIN study is comforting. As mentioned by the MAH, the DRV concentration 
above the EC50 is probably sufficient in patients with treatment failure on EFV, with the known caveats 
(specific DRV mutations and viral load restriction) that are now stated in the SmPC for this patient category.  
2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects  
The safety profile of DRV/RTV has been established in the two pivotal studies TMC114-C211 up to 192 weeks 
and TMC114-C229 up to 48 weeks and through post-marketing experience. The most recent periodic safety 
update report for DRV, covering the period 24 December 2011 to 23 December 2012, concluded that DRV 
continues to have a favorable benefit-risk profile for the registered indications and that no further changes 
to the Company Core Data Sheet and Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
The safety profile of DRV/COBI is based on the data from the Phase 3b study GS US 216 0130 in HIV-1 
infected subjects and on the safety profiles of the individual agents, DRV (in combination with rtv) and COBI 
up to 48 weeks.  
The overall number of subjects exposed to DRV/COBI once daily in clinical studies included in this application 
is 313 from study GS US-216 0130 and 33 from study GS-US-216-0115. The overall number of subjects 
exposed to DRV/COBI once daily in clinical studies conducted by Gilead and not included in this application 
is 24 (study GS-US-216-0119 during 10 days) and 33 healthy subjects from study GS US 216-0115 who 
were exposed during 10 days. 
Cobicistat  
During the development of COBI adverse reactions for COBI-boosted atazanavir (ATV) were consistent with 
the safety profile of rtv-boosted ATV in HIV patients. No comparative safety data of DRV/RTV vs DRV/COBI 
in HIV patients is available, because DRV/COBI has only been evaluated in a single arm study in HIV patients 
(GS US 216 0130). 
Cobicistat has been shown to decrease the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by 
Cockcroft-Gault method (eGFRCG) due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. An increase in serum 
creatinine due to COBI's inhibitory effect generally does not exceed 0.4 mg/dL from baseline.  
DRV in combination with COBI  
In healthy volunteers treatment with DRV/COBI 600/100 mg twice daily was not associated with increased 
adverse safety findings versus rtv-boosted DRV (GS-US-216-0119). In the other study in healthy volunteers 
(GS-US_216-0115) one subject from 33 discontinued DRV/COBI on Day 8 due to maculopapular rash 
(drug-related, grade 2); the rash resolved by Day 15.

GS US 216 0130 
The number of subjects treated in the study (313 subjects in total) allows detecting adverse events (AEs) of 
reasonable frequency (in the range of 1 to 5%) during a 6-month treatment.  
The review did not identify new ADRs associated with DRV/COBI compared to the well documented ADR 
safety profile of DRV, and that of COBI in HIV-1 infected subjects. 
Exposure 
The median duration of exposure to study medication through the cut-off date for the Week-24 analysis was 
31.4 weeks (range 0.1 to 42.4 weeks), with a median exposure of 31.9 weeks in the treatment-naïve 
subjects and a median exposure of 26.6 weeks in treatment-experienced subjects. A total of 281 subjects 
(89.8%) had received the study medication for at least 24 weeks at the time of the cut-off date for this 
analysis, 89.8% of the treatment-naïve subjects and 88.9% of the treatment experienced subjects. 
Adverse events 
The primary endpoint were AEs: 5.8% of subjects experienced at least 1 grade 3 (5.1%) or grade 4 (0.6%) 
AE.  
Five subjects (1.6%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 AE that was considered study drug-related by the 
investigator: neuropathy peripheral and immune reconstitution syndrome (both reported in the same 
subject), hypersensitivity, allergic dermatitis, maculopapular rash, and vesicular rash (reported in 1 subject 
each). There were 2 grade 4 AEs in 1 subject each, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and 
hypersensitivity, neither were assessed as drug-related. 
In total, 39.3% of subjects experienced at least 1 AE that was considered by the investigator as related to 
DRV/COBI. Diarrhea (14.7%) and nausea (14.4%) were the only AEs considered to be study drug-related in 
more than 5% of subjects, most drug related AEs were recorded in 1 or 2 subjects. 
The other reported AEs were consistent with those expected in the subject population and the known safety 
profiles of the study medications: diarrhea (24.9%), nausea (21.4%), upper respiratory tract infection 
(9.9%), headache (9.3%), rash (preferred term, 8.6%), vomiting (8.3%), fatigue (6.4%), flatulence 
(6.1%), nasopharyngitis (5.8%) and sinusitis (5.4%). 
Adverse drug reactions:  
Overall, 62.6% of subjects experienced at least 1 ADR in the Week-24 analysis of the study. Individual ADRs 
with an incidence >10% were diarrhea (25.2%), nausea (21.4%), and rash (grouped term, 16.0%) 
Deaths, SAEs and discontinuations 
There were no deaths in the Week-24 analysis, 15 subjects (4.8%) experienced one or more SAEs, including 
3 subjects (1.0%) who each had one SAE considered as drug-related by the investigator (immune 
reconstitution syndrome, rash, and maculopapular rash).  
Treatment was permanently discontinued in 15 subjects (4.8%) because of 1 or more AEs. The most 
common AEs that led to discontinuation were rash (preferred term) and maculopapular rash, both of which 
were experienced by 3 subjects (1.0%). Nausea and hypersensitivity each resulted in discontinuation of 2 
subjects (0.6%). All but 2 AEs that led to discontinuation were considered by the investigators to be study 
drug-related.

Specific concern: special interest 
Overall, 23.6% of subjects experienced at least 1 AE of interest. Adverse events of interest to DRV/COBI 
were most prevalent in the AE groupings of Rash (grouped term, 16.3%), Lipid Abnormalities (2.9%) and 
Severe Skin Reactions (2.6%). None of the AEs of interest were grade 4 and few were grade 3 (rash, 
grouped term, reported in 2 [0.6%] subjects, hepatotoxicity in 2 [0.6%] subjects and immune 
reconstitution syndrome in 1 [0.3%] subject). 
Seven subjects (2.2%) discontinued treatment for an AE of interest, all rash-related. 
Laboratory: no major laboratory related AEs were reported, including no other renal dysfunction other than 
the known increase in serum creatinine due to COBI and mean change of eGFR -11.5 ml/min at week 24. An 
increase in creatinine was observed in 17.7% of subjects, the increase was grade 1 in 14.5% of subjects and 
grade 2 in 3.2% of subjects. 
No apparent pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships were observed between DRV AUC24h and the 
occurrence of rash, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, or between DRV AUC24h and the worst toxicity grade in 
alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, amylase, lipase, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, or triglycerides. COBI 
exposures were not recorded. 
Special populations 
The dose of COBI to be used with DRV in children less than 18 years of age has not been established. 
DRV/COBI should not be used in children below 3 years of age in view of toxicity observed in juvenile rats 
dosed with DRV. 
Limited information is available with DRV or COBI in patients 65 years of age and older. 
Darunavir/COBI has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment. Limited information is 
available on the use of DRV/COBI in patients coinfected with hepatitis B or C. Darunavir/COBI has not been 
investigated in patients with renal impairment.  
Comparison with historical controls DRV/RTV vs. DRV/COBI 
The incidence of individual ADRs (any grade) in the Week-24 analyses of study GS US 216 0130 and of the 
historical studies was similar.  The incidence of the ADR rash (any severity grade) was higher in study 
GS-US-216-0130, (16.0%), than in studies TMC114‑ C211 (8.2%) and TMC114 C229 (5.8%). The higher 
incidence of rash, along with a higher proportion of rash events leading to discontinuation in 
GS-US-216-0130 was due to grade 1 and grade 2 events. There were no noticeable differences in the 
incidence of grade 3 rashes and there were no cases of grade 4 rash. Rash was mostly mild to moderate, 
often occurring within the first 4 weeks of treatment and resolving with continued dosing. 
Additional week 48 data GS_US-216-0130 
An interim safety analysis was done of the ongoing study GS-US-216-0130 at Week 48, when all subjects 
had been treated for 48 weeks or discontinued earlier (cut-off date 08 February 2013).  
The overall safety profile of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily is similar in the Week-48 analysis as in the 
Week-24 analysis of study GS-US-216-0130, taking into account the increase in exposure duration.  
No new pattern or safety signal was observed.  
Overall, 91.4% of subjects experienced at least 1 AE, compared to 87.9% in the Week-24 analysis. The 
incidence of SAEs was 4.8% in the Week 24 analysis and 8.3% in the Week-48 analysis; none of the new 
SAEs were considered to be related to the study medication.  
There was 1 new AE leading to treatment discontinuation in the Week-48 analysis: renal tubular disorder 
(verbatim: proximal tubulopathy, grade 1, not related, not serious).  
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 27/54 
  
  
Overall, there were 5 new subjects with AEs reported by the investigator as possibly related to the study 
medication (diarrhea, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, oropharyngeal pain, influenza, obesity, 
depression, abnormal dreams, and insomnia), none were serious, of grade 4, or led to treatment 
discontinuation. 
There were no new grade 4 AEs in the Week-48 analysis. None of the new grade 3 AEs reported were 
considered related to the study medication. 
AEs of interest: Overall, there was no increase over time in the occurrence of AEs of interest: 27.2% of 
subjects experienced at least 1 AE of interest in the Week-48 analysis, compared to 23.6% in the Week 24 
analysis. The newly reported preferred terms under the AEs of interest were hyperlipidemia, ocular icterus, 
diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose, ECG ST-T segment abnormal, amylase increased, and lipase 
increased. 
No new safety signals were identified in the Week-48 analysis. The overall ADR profile of DRV/COBI 800/150 
mg once daily at Week 48 is consistent with the Week-24 profile. At Week 48, 66.5% of subjects experienced 
at least 1 ADR, compared to 62.6% of subjects in the Week-24 analysis. Since the Week-24 analysis, 12 
additional subjects (3.8%) reported at least 1 ADR; 2 additional subjects (0.6%) had at least 1 serious ADR 
and none had an ADR that led to treatment discontinuation. 
Laboratory: There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline through Week 48 in mean values for the 
hematology parameters or clinical chemistry parameters, for the lipid parameters (fasting HDL cholesterol, 
fasting LDL cholesterol, fasting total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio, or fasting glucose), or for the 
liver-related laboratory tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin [direct, indirect and total]).  
Renal function: The increase from baseline in serum creatinine from Week 2 onwards (mean change 0.09 
mg/dL) remained stable during DRV/COBI treatment. In the Week-48 analysis, 7 subjects (2.2%, ie, 1 
subject more than in the Week-24 analysis) had a confirmed creatinine increase from baseline ≥ 0.4 mg/dL 
at 1 or more consecutive visits. In these 7 subjects, the maximum observed increases from baseline at any 
visit ranged between +0.41 and +0.69 mg/dL. Four of these subjects had last recorded creatinine value 
<0.4mg/dL. Except for one subject (CRF ID 1236-4051, who discontinued, renal AE not related to study 
medication), none of the 7 subjects presented laboratory abnormalities suggestive of renal proximal 
tubulopathy or signs of subclinical kidney disease.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.6.  Changes to the Product Information 
During the procedure, the CHMP requested that: 
1.  Specific safety concerns when DRV is used in combination with COBI to be included in the SmPC. 
2.  Week 48 data of study GS-US-216-0130 to be incorporated in the SmPC. 
3.  Since there is a difference in interaction potential of Prezista when boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, 
the information on these interactions to be described more clearly in the SmPC. 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
SmPC 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
PREZISTA, co-administered with low dose ritonavir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult and 
paediatric patients from the age of 3 years and at least 15 kg body weight (see section 4.2). 
PREZISTA, co-administered with cobicistat is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection in adult patients (see section 
4.2). 
In deciding to initiate treatment with PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir, careful 
consideration should be given to the treatment history of the individual patient and the patterns of mutations 
associated with different agents. Genotypic or phenotypic testing (when available) and treatment history 
should guide the use of PREZISTA. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
[…] 
The interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacokinetic 
enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different contraindications and recommendations for concomitant 
medications depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat (see sections 4.3, 
4.4 and 4.5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 37/54 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Posology 
PREZISTA must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products. The Summary of Product Characteristics of 
cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of therapy with 
PREZISTA. Cobicistat is not indicated for use in twice daily regimens or for use in the pediatric population. 
ART-naïve adult patients 
The recommended dose regimen is 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir 100 mg 
once daily taken with food. 
ART-experienced adult patients 
The recommended dose regimen is 600 mg twice daily taken with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken with 
food. 
A dose regimen of 800 mg once daily with cobicistat 150 mg once daily or ritonavir 100 mg once daily taken 
with food may be used in patients with prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without 
darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA 
< 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
*  DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V 
[…] 
ART-experienced paediatric patients (3 to 17 years of age and weighing at least 15 kilograms) 
PREZISTA twice daily taken with ritonavir taken with food is usually recommended. 
A once daily dose regimen of PREZISTA taken with ritonavir taken with food may be used in patients with 
prior exposure to antiretroviral medicinal products but without darunavir resistance associated mutations 
(DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count 
≥ 100 cells x 106/l. 
*  DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V 
The weight-based dose of PREZISTA and ritonavir in paediatric patients is provided in the table below. The 
recommended dose of PREZISTA with low dose ritonavir should not exceed the recommended adult dose 
(600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily). The dose of cobicistat to be used with PREZISTA in 
children less than 18 years of age has not been established.

For ART-experienced paediatric patients HIV genotypic testing is recommended. However, when HIV 
genotypic testing is not feasible, the PREZISTA/ritonavir once daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV 
protease inhibitor-naïve paediatric patients and the twice daily dosing regimen is recommended in HIV 
protease inhibitor-experienced patients. 
PREZISTA oral suspension can be used in patients unable to swallow PREZISTA tablets. PREZISTA is also 
available as 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg film-coated tablets. 
Advice on missed doses 
The following guidance is based on the half-life of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat or ritonavir and the 
recommended dosing interval of approximately 12 hours (twice daily regimen) or approximately 24 hours 
(once daily regimen).

● 
● 
If using the twice daily regimen: in case a dose of PREZISTA and/or ritonavir was missed within 
6 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed dose of 
PREZISTA and ritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this was noticed later than 6 hours after the 
time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient should resume the usual 
dosing schedule. 
If using the once daily regimen: in case a dose of PREZISTA and/or cobicistat or ritonavir was missed 
within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, patients should be instructed to take the prescribed 
dose of PREZISTA and cobicistat or ritonavir with food as soon as possible. If this was noticed later 
than 12 hours after the time it is usually taken, the missed dose should not be taken and the patient 
should resume the usual dosing schedule. 
Special populations 
[…] 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for darunavir/ritonavir in patients with renal impairment (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). Cobicistat has not been studied in patients receiving dialysis, and, therefore, no recommendation 
can be made for the use of darunavir/cobicistat in these patients. 
Cobicistat inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine and may cause modest increases in serum creatinine 
and modest declines in creatinine clearance. Hence, the use of creatinine clearance as an estimate of renal 
elimination capacity may be misleading. Cobicistat as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of darunavir should, 
therefore, not be initiated in patients with creatine clearance less than 70 ml/min if any co-administered 
agent requires dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance: e.g. emtricitabine, lamivudine, tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate or adefovir dipovoxil. 
For information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Paediatric patients 
PREZISTA should not be used in children. 
- 
- 
below 3 years of age, because of safety concerns (see sections 4.4 and 5.3), or, 
less than 15 kg body weight, as the dose for this population has not been established in a sufficient 
number of patients (see section 5.1) 
Administration of PREZISTA 800 mg once daily with low dose ritonavir in treatment-naïve adolescents 12 to 
17 years weighing at least 40 kg leads to darunavir exposures within the therapeutic range as established in 
adults receiving the same dosing regimen. Since PREZISTA once daily has also been registered for use in 
treatment-experienced adults without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who 
have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l, the same indication 
of PREZISTA once daily applies to treatment-experienced children 3 to 17 years weighing at least 15 kg. 
*  DRV-RAMs: V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V and L89V 
Method of administration 
Patients should be instructed to take PREZISTA with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir within 30 minutes after 
completion of a meal. The type of food does not affect the exposure to darunavir (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 
5.2). 
[…] 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Use in patients with severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic impairment. 
Concomitant treatment with any of the following medicinal products is contraindicated given the expected 
decrease in plasma concentrations of darunavir, ritonavir and cobicistat and the potential for loss of 
therapeutic effect (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Applicable to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat: 
- 
The combination product lopinavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5). 
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 39/54 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
The strong CYP3A inducers rifampicin and herbal preparations containing St John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum). Co-administration is expected to reduce plasma concentrations of darunavir, ritonavir 
and cobicistat, which could lead to loss of therapeutic effect and possible development of resistance 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Applicable to darunavir boosted with cobicistat, not when boosted with ritonavir: 
- 
Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction than darunavir boosted with 
ritonavir. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated, since these may reduce the 
exposure to cobicistat and darunavir leading to loss of therapeutic effect. Strong CYP3A inducers 
include e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat inhibits the elimination of active substances that are 
highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance, which results in increased exposure to the co-administered 
medicinal product. Therefore, concomitant treatment with such medicinal products for which elevated 
plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated (applies 
to darunavir boosted with either ritonavir or cobicistat). These active substances include e.g.: 
- 
- 
alfuzosin (alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist 
amiodarone, bepridil, dronedarone, quinidine, ranolazine, systemic lidocaine 
(antiarrhythmics/antianginals) 
astemizole, terfenadine (antihistamines) 
colchicine when used in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment (antigout) (see section 4.5) 
ergot derivatives (e.g. dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergonovine) 
cisapride (gastrointestinal motility agents) 
pimozide, quetiapine, sertindole (antipsychotics/neuroleptics) (see section 4.5) 
triazolam, midazolam administered orally (sedatives/hypnotics) (for caution on parenterally 
administered midazolam, see section 4.5) 
sildenafil - when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, avanafil (PDE-5 
inhibitors) 
simvastatin and lovastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) (see section 4.5) 
ticagrelor (antiplatelets) (see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
[…] 
PREZISTA must always be given orally with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer 
and in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products (see section 5.2). The Summary of Product 
Characteristics of cobicistat or ritonavir as appropriate, must therefore be consulted prior to initiation of 
therapy with PREZISTA. 
Increasing the dose of ritonavir from that recommended in section 4.2 did not significantly affect darunavir 
concentrations. It is not recommended to alter the dose of cobicistat or ritonavir. 
[…] 
ART-experienced patients – once daily dosing 
PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir once daily in ART-experienced patients 
should not be used in patients with one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) or 
HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2). Combinations with 
optimised background regimen (OBRs) other than ≥ 2 NRTIs have not been studied in this population. 
Limited data are available in patients with HIV-1 clades other than B (see section 5.1). 
[…] 
Severe skin reactions 
During the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), severe skin reactions, which may 
be accompanied with fever and/or elevations of transaminases, have been reported in 0.4% of patients. 
DRESS (Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome has been 
rarely (< 0.1%) reported, and during post-marketing experience toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute 
generalised exanthematous pustulosis have been reported. PREZISTA should be discontinued immediately if 
signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions develop. These can include, but are not limited to, severe rash 
or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, 
conjunctivitis, hepatitis and/or eosinophilia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 40/54 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment-experienced patients receiving regimens containing 
PREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir compared to patients receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir without raltegravir or 
raltegravir without PREZISTA (see section 4.8). 
Darunavir contains a sulphonamide moiety. PREZISTA should be used with caution in patients with a known 
sulphonamide allergy. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Drug-induced hepatitis (e.g. acute hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis) has been reported with PREZISTA. During 
the darunavir/ritonavir clinical development program (N=3,063), hepatitis was reported in 0.5% of patients 
receiving combination antiretroviral therapy with PREZISTA/ritonavir. Patients with pre-existing liver 
dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis B or C, have an increased risk for liver function abnormalities 
including severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for 
hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. 
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with PREZISTA used in 
combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and patients should be monitored during treatment. 
Increased AST/ALT monitoring should be considered in patients with underlying chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, 
or in patients who have pre-treatment elevations of transaminases, especially during the first several 
months of PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir treatment. 
If there is evidence of new or worsening liver dysfunction (including clinically significant elevation of liver 
enzymes and/or symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, dark urine, liver tenderness, 
hepatomegaly) in patients using PREZISTA used in combination with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir, 
interruption or discontinuation of treatment should be considered promptly. 
Patients with coexisting conditions 
[…] 
Renal impairment 
No special precautions or dose adjustments for darunavir/ritonavir are required in patients with renal 
impairment. As darunavir and ritonavir are highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that they will be 
significantly removed by haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no special precautions or dose 
adjustments are required in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Cobicistat has not been studied in 
patients receiving dialysis, therefore, no recommendation can be made for the use of darunavir/cobicistat in 
these patients (see section 4.2). 
Cobicistat decreases the estimated creatinine clearance due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine. 
This should be taken into consideration if darunavir with cobicistat is administered to patients in whom the 
estimated creatinine clearance is used to adjust doses of co-administered medicinal products (see section 
4.2 and cobicistat SmPC). 
There are currently inadequate data to determine whether co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate and cobicistat is associated with a greater risk of renal adverse reactions compared with regimens 
that include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate without cobicistat. 
[…] 
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral 
therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise 
and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been 
observed within the first weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus 
retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii 
(formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment 
instituted when necessary. In addition, reactivation of herpes simplex and herpes zoster has been observed 
in clinical studies with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune 
reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur many months 
after initiation of treatment (see section 4.8).

Interactions with medicinal products 
Pharmacokinetic enhancer and concomitant medications 
Darunavir has different interaction profiles depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or 
cobicistat: 
- 
Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more sensitive for CYP3A induction: concomitant use of 
darunavir/cobicistat and strong CYP3A inducers is therefore contraindicated (see section 4.3), and 
concomitant use with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use of darunavir/ritonavir and darunavir/cobicistat with lopinavir/ritonavir, rifampicin 
and herbal products containing St John’s wort, Hypericum perforatum, is contraindicated (see section 
4.5). 
Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not have inducing effects on enzymes or transport proteins (see 
section 4.5). If switching the pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat, caution is required 
during the first two weeks of treatment with darunavir/cobicistat, particularly if doses of any 
concomitantly administered medicinal products have been titrated or adjusted during use of ritonavir 
as a pharmacoenhancer. A dose reduction of the co-administered drug may be needed in these cases. 
- 
Efavirenz in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily may result in sub-optimal 
darunavir Cmin. If efavirenz is to be used in combination with PREZISTA/ritonavir, the PREZISTA/ritonavir 
600/100 mg twice daily regimen should be used. See the Summary of Product Characteristics for PREZISTA 
75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg or 600 mg tablets (see section 4.5). 
[…] 
4.5  Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The interaction profile of darunavir may differ depending on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as 
pharmacoenhancer. The recommendations given for concomitant use of darunavir and other medicinal 
products may therefore differ depending on whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat (see 
sections 4.3 and 4.4), and caution is also required during the first time of treatment if switching the 
pharmacoenhancer from ritonavir to cobicistat (see section 4.4). 
Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (ritonavir as pharmacoenhancer) 
Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolised by CYP3A. Medicinal products that induce CYP3A activity would be 
expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of 
these compounds and consequently that of darunavir, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and possible 
development of resistance (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). CYP3A inducers that are contraindicated include 
rifampicin, St John’s wort and lopinavir. 
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with other medicinal products that inhibit CYP3A may decrease 
the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir 
and ritonavir. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended and caution is warranted, 
these interactions are described in the interaction table below (e.g. indinavir, systemic azoles like 
ketoconazole and clotrimazole). 
Medicinal products that affect darunavir exposure (cobicistat as pharmacoenhancer) 
Darunavir and cobicistat are metabolised by CYP3A, and co-administration with CYP3A inducers may 
therefore result in subtherapeutic plasma exposure to darunavir. Darunavir boosted with cobicistat is more 
sensitive to CYP3A induction than ritonavir-boosted darunavir: co-administration of darunavir/cobicistat 
with medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g. St John’s wort, rifampicin, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, and phenytoin) is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Co-administration of 
darunavir/cobicistat with weak to moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, 
boceprevir, telaprevir, fluticasone, and bosentan) is not recommended (see interaction table below). 
For co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, the same recommendations apply independent of 
whether darunavir is boosted with ritonavir or with cobicistat (see section above). 
Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with ritonavir 
Darunavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-gp. Co-administration of darunavir/ritonavir 
with medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP3A and/or CYP2D6 or transported by P-gp may result 
in increased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic 
effect and adverse reactions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/664598/2014 
Page 42/54 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Darunavir co-administered with low dose ritonavir must not be combined with medicinal products that are 
highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which increased systemic exposure is associated with 
serious and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index) (see section 4.3). 
The overall pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the 
systemic exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with 
ritonavir at 100 mg twice daily. Therefore, darunavir must only be used in combination with a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (see section 5.2). 
A clinical study utilising a cocktail of medicinal products that are metabolised by cytochromes CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 demonstrated an increase in CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 activity and inhibition of CYP2D6 
activity in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir, which may be attributed to the presence of low dose ritonavir. 
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with medicinal products which are primarily metabolised by 
CYP2D6 (such as flecainide, propafenone, metoprolol) may result in increased plasma concentrations of 
these medicinal products, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. 
Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C9 (such 
as warfarin) and CYP2C19 (such as methadone) may result in decreased systemic exposure to such 
medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their therapeutic effect. 
Although the effect on CYP2C8 has only been studied in vitro, co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir 
and medicinal products primarily metabolised by CYP2C8 (such as paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, repaglinide) may 
result in decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, which could decrease or shorten their 
therapeutic effect. 
Ritonavir inhibits the transporters P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and co-administration with 
substrates of these transporters can result in increased plasma concentrations of these compounds (e.g. 
dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, statins and bosentan; see the Interaction table below). 
Medicinal products that may be affected by darunavir boosted with cobicistat 
The recommendations for darunavir boosted with ritonavir are adequate also for darunavir boosted with 
cobicistat with regard to substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (see 
contraindications and recommendations presented in the section above). Cobicistat 150 mg given with 
darunavir 800 mg once daily enhances darunavir pharmacokinetic parameters in a comparable way to 
ritonavir (see section 5.2). 
Unlike ritonavir, cobicistat does not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or UGT1A1. For 
further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Interaction table 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Several of the interaction studies (indicated by # in the table below) have been performed at lower than 
recommended doses of darunavir or with a different dosing regimen (see section 4.2 Posology). The effects 
on co-administered medicinal products may thus be underestimated and clinical monitoring of safety may be 
indicated. 
The interaction profile of darunavir depends on whether ritonavir or cobicistat is used as pharmacokinetic 
enhancer. Darunavir may therefore have different recommendations for concomitant medications 
depending on whether the compound is boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat. No interaction studies presented 
in the table have been performed with darunavir boosted with cobicistat. The same recommendations apply, 
unless specifically indicated. For further information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
Interactions between darunavir/ritonavir and antiretroviral and non-antiretroviral medicinal products are 
listed in the table below (not determined as “ND”). The direction of the arrow for each pharmacokinetic 
parameter is based on the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratio being within (↔), below (↓) 
or above (↑) the 80-125% range. 
In the table below the specific pharmacokinetic enhancer is specified when recommendeations differ. When 
the recommendation is the same for PREZISTA when co-administered with a low dose ritonavir or cobicistat, 
the term “boosted PREZISTA” is used.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
[…] 
PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir should be used during pregnancy only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
PREZISTA in combination with cobicistat or ritonavir has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. However, dizziness has been reported in some patients during treatment with regimens 
containing PREZISTA co-administered with cobicistat or low dose ritonavir and should be borne in mind when 
considering a patient’s ability to drive or operate machinery (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
During the clinical development program (N=2,613 treatment-experienced subjects who initiated therapy 
with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily), 51.3% of subjects experienced at least one adverse 
reaction. The total mean treatment duration for subjects was 95.3 weeks. The most frequent adverse 
reactions reported in clinical trials and as spontaneous reports are diarrhoea, nausea, rash, headache and 
vomiting. The most frequent serious reactions are acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, immune 
reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, thrombocytopenia, osteonecrosis, diarrhoea, hepatitis and pyrexia. 
In the 96 week analysis, the safety profile of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in treatment-naïve 
subjects was similar to that seen with PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in treatment-experienced 
subjects except for nausea which was observed more frequently in treatment-naïve subjects. This was 
driven by mild intensity nausea. No new safety findings were identified in the 192 week analysis of the 
treatment- naïve subjects in which the mean treatment duration of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once 
daily was 162.5 weeks. 
During the Phase III clinical trial GS-US-216-130 with darunavir/cobicistat (N=313 treatment-naïve and 
treatment-experienced subjects), 66.5% of subjects experienced at least one adverse reaction. The mean 
treatment duration was 58.4 weeks. The most frequent adverse reactions reported were diarrhoea (28%), 
nausea (23%), and rash (16%). Serious adverse reactions are diabetes mellitus, (drug) hypersensitivity, 
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, rash and vomiting.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Rash 
In clinical trials, rash was mostly mild to moderate, often occurring within the first four weeks of treatment 
and resolving with continued dosing. In cases of severe skin reaction see the warning in section 4.4. In a

single arm trial investigating darunavir 800 mg once daily in combination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily 
and other antiretrovirals 2.2% of patients discontinued treatment due to rash. 
During the clinical development program of raltegravir in treatment-experienced patients, rash, irrespective 
of causality, was more commonly observed with regimens containing PREZISTA/ritonavir + raltegravir 
compared to those containing PREZISTA/ritonavir without raltegravir or raltegravir without 
PREZISTA/ritonavir. Rash considered by the investigator to be drug-related occurred at similar rates. The 
exposure-adjusted rates of rash (all causality) were 10.9, 4.2, and 3.8 per 100 patient-years (PYR), 
respectively; and for drug-related rash were 2.4, 1.1, and 2.3 per 100 PYR, respectively. The rashes 
observed in clinical studies were mild to moderate in severity and did not result in discontinuation of therapy 
(see section 4.4). 
[…] 
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral 
therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. 
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves' disease) have also been reported; however, the reported time to 
onset is more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 
4.4).

[…] 
Viruses isolated from patients on PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily experiencing virologic failure 
by rebound that were susceptible to tipranavir at baseline remained susceptible to tipranavir after treatment 
in the vast majority of cases. 
The lowest rates of developing resistant HIV virus are observed in ART-naïve patients who are treated for the 
first time with darunavir in combination with other ART.

Clinical results 
All clinical trials were performed with PREZISTA co-administered with low dose ritonavir. 
The pharmacokinetic enhancing effect of cobicistat on darunavir was evaluated in a Phase I study in healthy 
subjects that were administered darunavir 800 mg with either cobicistat at 150 mg or ritonavir at 100 mg 
once daily. The steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of darunavir were comparable when boosted with 
cobicistat versus ritonavir. For information on cobicistat, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
Adult patients 
Efficacy of darunavir 800 mg once daily co-administered with 150 mg cobicistat once daily in ART-naïve and 
ART-experienced patients 
GS-US-216-130 is a single arm, open-label, Phase III trial evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of darunavir with cobicistat in 313 HIV-1 infected adult patients 
(295 treatment-naïve and 18 treatment-experienced). These patients received darunavir 800 mg once daily 
in combination with cobicistat 150 mg once daily with an investigator selected background regimen 
consisting of 2 active NRTIs. 
HIV-1 infected patients who were eligible for this trial had a screening genotype showing no darunavir RAMs 
and plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥ 1000 copies/ml. The table below shows the efficacy data of the 48 week analyses

Efficacy of PREZISTA 800 mg once daily co-administered with 100 mg ritonavir once daily in ART-naïve 
patients 
The evidence of efficacy of PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily is based on the analyses of 192 week 
data from the randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III trial ARTEMIS in antiretroviral treatment-naïve 
HIV-1 infected patients comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily with lopinavir/ritonavir 
800/200 mg per day (given as a twice-daily or as a once-daily regimen). Both arms used a fixed background 
regimen consisting of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg once daily and emtricitabine 200 mg once daily.

At 48 weeks non-inferiority in virologic response to the PREZISTA/ritonavir treatment, defined as the 
percentage of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA level < 400 and < 50 copies/ml, was demonstrated (at the 
pre-defined 12% non-inferiority margin) for both ITT and OP populations. These results were confirmed in 
the analysis of data at 96 weeks of treatment in the TITAN trial, with 60.4% of patients in the 
PREZISTA/ritonavir arm having HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml at week 96 compared to 55.2% in the 
lopinavir/ritonavir arm [difference: 5.2%, 95% CI (-2.8; 13.1)]. 
ODIN is a Phase III, randomised, open-label trial comparing PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily 
versus PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily in ART-experienced HIV-1 infected patients with 
screening genotype resistance testing showing no darunavir RAMs (i.e. V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54M, 
I54L, T74P, L76V, I84V, L89V) and a screening HIV-1 RNA > 1,000 copies/ml. Efficacy analysis is based on 
48 weeks of treatment (see table below). Both arms used an optimised background regimen (OBR) of 
≥ 2 NRTIs.

At 48 weeks, virologic response, defined as the percentage of patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA level 
< 50 copies/ml, with PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily treatment was demonstrated to be 
non-inferior (at the pre-defined 12% non-inferiority margin) compared to PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg 
twice daily for both ITT and OP populations. 
PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily in ART-experienced patients should not be used in patients with 
one or more darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs) or HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml or 
CD4+ cell count < 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2 and 4.4). Limited data is available in patients with HIV-1 
clades other than B. 
POWER 1 and POWER 2 are randomised, controlled trials comparing PREZISTA co-administered with 
ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily) with a control group receiving an investigator-selected PI(s) regimen in 
HIV-1 infected patients who had previously failed more than 1 PI containing regimen. An OBR consisting of 
at least 2 NRTIs with or without enfuvirtide (ENF) was used in both trials. 
The table below shows the efficacy data of the 48-week and 96-week analyses from the pooled POWER 1 and

Paediatric patients 
ART-experienced paediatric patients from the age of 3 to < 6 years 
The pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of PREZISTA/ritonavir b.i.d. in combination with other 
antiretroviral agents in 21 ART-experienced HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 3 to < 6 years and 
weighing 10 kg to < 20 kg was evaluated in an open-label, Phase II trial, ARIEL. Patients received a 
weight-based twice daily treatment regimen, patients weighing 10 kg to < 15 kg received 
darunavir/ritonavir 25/3 mg/kg b.i.d, and patients weighing 15 kg to < 20 kg received darunavir/ritonavir 
375/50 mg b.i.d. At week 48, the virologic response, defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed 
plasma viral load < 50 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml, was evaluated in 16 paediatric patients 15 kg to < 20 kg and 
5 paediatric patients 10 kg to < 15 kg receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral 
agents (see section 4.2 for dosage recommendations per body weight).

The pharmacokinetic properties of darunavir, co-administered with cobicistat or ritonavir, have been 
evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV-1 infected patients. Exposure to darunavir was higher in 
HIV-1 infected patients than in healthy subjects. The increased exposure to darunavir in HIV-1 infected 
patients compared to healthy subjects may be explained by the higher concentrations of α1-acid 
glycoprotein (AAG) in HIV-1 infected patients, resulting in higher darunavir binding to plasma AAG and, 
therefore, higher plasma concentrations. 
Darunavir is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Cobicistat and ritonavir inhibit CYP3A, thereby increasing the 
plasma concentrations of darunavir considerably. 
For information on cobicistat pharmacokinetic properties, consult the cobicistat Summary of Product 
Characteristics. 
Absorption 
Darunavir was rapidly absorbed following oral administration. Maximum plasma concentration of darunavir 
in the presence of low dose ritonavir is generally achieved within 2.5-4.0 hours. 
The absolute oral bioavailability of a single 600 mg dose of darunavir alone was approximately 37% and 
increased to approximately 82% in the presence of 100 mg twice daily ritonavir. The overall 
pharmacokinetic enhancement effect by ritonavir was an approximate 14-fold increase in the systemic 
exposure of darunavir when a single dose of 600 mg darunavir was given orally in combination with ritonavir 
at 100 mg twice daily (see section 4.4). 
When administered without food, the relative bioavailability of darunavir in the presence of cobicistat or low 
dose ritonavir is lower as compared to intake with food. Therefore, PREZISTA tablets should be taken with 
cobicistat or ritonavir and with food. The type of food does not affect exposure to darunavir.

Special populations 
Paediatric population 
[…] 
The pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken twice daily in 
14 treatment-experienced paediatric patients, aged 3 to < 6 years and weighing at least 15 kg to < 20 kg, 
showed that weight-based dosages resulted in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in 
adults receiving PREZISTA/ritonavir 600/100 mg twice daily (see section 4.2). 
The pharmacokinetics of darunavir in combination with ritonavir taken once daily in 12 ART-naïve paediatric 
patients, aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg, showed that PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg 
once daily results in darunavir exposure that was comparable to that achieved in adults receiving 
PREZISTA/ritonavir 800/100 mg once daily. Therefore the same once daily dosage may be used in 
treatment-experienced adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing at least 40 kg without darunavir 
resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and 
CD4+ cell count ≥ 100 cells x 106/l (see section 4.2).

Annex II was also updated with a correction to the address of one of the manufacturers responsible for 
batch release  
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of France, Romania, Ireland and Cyprus. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The type II variation to update the darunavir (DRV; Prezista) product information concerns the inclusion of 
use of Tybost (cobicistat, COBI) 150 mg once daily as a pharmacokinetic enhancer next to ritonavir. COBI 
has been approved as a pharmaco-enhancer of Atazanavir and DRV in 2013.  
Consequently, the SmPC of COBI was used by the MAH to update the SmPC of DRV using the data of an 
open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover Phase 1 study in 33 healthy subjects bioequivalence study, 
GS-US-216-0115. This demonstrated overall similar PK parameters of DRV apart from Ctau, that was ~30% 
lower. The MAH has already demonstrated that virologic suppression was not influenced by Ctau and as a 
consequence registration of COBI 150 mg qd as a booster of DRV 800 mg qd has been approved.  
In addition, data from a single arm Phase III study GS-US-216-0130 in 295 treatment naive and 18 
treatment experienced patients is now submitted to support efficacy and safety (48 week data). 
The indications of DRV 800 mg qd boosted by RTV 100 mg qd will also apply to DRV 800 mg qd boosted by 
COBI 150 mg qd, but only in adults since in patients < 18 years COBI has not been studied.  
For treatment experienced patients the same limitations will apply that are incorporated in the use of DRV 
800 mg qd when boosted by RTV :  without darunavir resistance associated mutations (DRV-RAMs)* and 
who have plasma HIV-1 RNA < 100,000 copies/ml and CD4+ cell count ≥  100 cells x 106/l. In other patient 
categories DRV 600 mg twice daily should be administered with RTV 100 mg twice daily, but COBI twice daily 
cannot be administered because this has never been studied.  
The substantiation of the claim of adequate pharmaco-enhancement of DRV by COBI can be derived from 
study GS-US-216-0130: similar efficacy at week 24 was reported in treatment naive patients when DRV was 
boosted by COBI compared to efficacy rates from historical studies of DRV in combination with RTV.  Efficacy 
at week 48 was in line with findings at week 24. The week 48 results have been included in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC.

suspension and the 400mg, 800mg film-coated tablets with information on the use of darunavir with 
cobicistat as pharmacokinetic enhancer. Consequential changes have been introduced in the SmPC of all 
formulations and also in the Package Leaflet (for 100mg/ml, 400 mg and 800 mg film-coated tablets). 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The manufacturer’s address is also corrected in the PL. 
Furthermore, there is an update of the Annex II with a correction to the address of one of the

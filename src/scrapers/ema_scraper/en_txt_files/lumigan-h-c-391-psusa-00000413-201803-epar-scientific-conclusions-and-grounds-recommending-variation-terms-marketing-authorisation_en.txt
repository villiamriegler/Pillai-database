Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bimatoprost, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
During the reporting period of this PSUR, a number of cases from routine pharmacovigilance activities 
were reported with positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge combined with a plausible mode of action 
and indicated a causal relationship with the use of bimatoprost containing medicinal products.  
Based on the available data presented in this PSUR, the PRAC considered that the SmPC (section 4.8) 
and Package Leaflet accordingly for: 
- bimatoprost 0.01% formulations should be amended to reflect the following adverse drug reactions: 
dizziness, hypertension, photophobia, skin discoloration (periocular), and ocular discomfort. The 
frequency cannot be calculated based on the available data and therefore included as “not known”. 
- bimatoprost 0.03% formulations should be amended to reflect the following adverse drug reactions: 
ocular discomfort and skin discoloration (periocular). The frequency cannot be calculated based on 
the available data and therefore included as “not known”. 
- bimatoprost 0.03% PF should be amended to reflect the following adverse drug reactions: dizziness, 
hypertension, skin discoloration (periocular), ocular discomfort and eye discharge. The frequency 
cannot be calculated based on the available data and therefore included as “not known”. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bimatoprost the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bimatoprost is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

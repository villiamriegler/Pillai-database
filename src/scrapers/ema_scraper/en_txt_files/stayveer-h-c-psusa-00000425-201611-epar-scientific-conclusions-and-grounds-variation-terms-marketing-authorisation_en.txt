Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for bosentan, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
A  study  (Srinivas  NR  et  al,  2016)  showed  that  the  exposure  of  tadalafil  was  reduced  by  bosentan. 
Bosentan (125 mg twice daily), a substrate of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9 and possibly CYP2C19, reduced tadalafil (40 mg once per day) systemic exposure by 42% and 
Cmax by 27% following multiple dose co-administration. The efficacy of tadalafil in patients already on 
bosentan  therapy  has  not  been  conclusively  demonstrated.  Tadalafil  did  not  affect  the  exposure  (AUC 
and  Cmax)  of  bosentan  or  its  metabolites.  Therefore,  the  interaction  between  tadalafil  and  bosentan 
should be mentioned in the bosentan product information. 
In  addition,  the  following  interactions  which  could  have  clinical  relevance  and  which  are  already 
mentioned  in  bosentan  SmPC  should  be  added  to  the  package  leaflet:  warfarin,  simvastatin, 
ketoconazole and sildenafil.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for bosentan the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing bosentan is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) involves the intravenous infusion of autologous or allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cells collected from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood to re-establish 
haematopoietic function in patients with damaged or defective bone marrow or immune system.  
When the stem cells are collected from another person, either from relatives (identical twins, HLA-matched 
related, mismatched related) or unrelated donors (matched unrelated, umbilical cord blood) it is called 
allogeneic transplant. In 2012, more transplants were registered from unrelated donors than related. 
Allogeneic HSCT has led to the cure of some forms of cancer (especially leukaemias), bone marrow failure, 
hereditary metabolic disorders, and severe congenital immunodeficiencies that would otherwise have been 
fatal.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication of treosulfan is as part of conditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in adults with 
malignant and non-malignant diseases and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
According to the latest European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) report, 42 171 transplants 
were reported in 37 626 patients in Europe in the year 2015; of these, 17 302 HSCTs (41%) were allogeneic and 
24 869 (59%) autologous. Compared with data from 2014, the total number of transplants increased by 3.3% 
(2.1% alloHSCT and 4.1% autoHSCT). In 2015, there were 4490 paediatric patients < 18 years of age receiving 
HSCT in Europe, 3338 received an allogeneic and 1152 an autologous HSCT.  
The number of alloHSCTs continues to increase by 10-20% annually, and reductions in organ damage, infection, 
and severe acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) seem to be contributing to improved outcomes. Total 
mortality among patients who underwent alloHSCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle fell from 
63% between 1993 and 1997 to 47% between 2003 and 2007. At the same time, non-relapse mortality fell from 
41% to 26%. In a study by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the 
10-year survival rate of 3788 patients who had survived at least two years after alloHSCT without relapse of 
their underlying disease was 85%. 
Survival after transplantation is comparable among patients receiving donor stem cells from HLA-identical 
sibling and matched unrelated donors for several diseases. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis  
Indications for alloHSCT 
Allogeneic HSCT is potentially curative for leukaemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), lymphomas and 
multiple myeloma (MM). It is also increasingly used in non-malignant diseases such as primary 
immunodeficiency, inborn errors of metabolism, haemoglobinopathies and bone marrow failure syndromes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 10/152 
  
  
According to the latest EBMT report, the most common indication for an alloHSCT is acute leukaemia (55%), 
especially AML (39%), followed by MDS/MPS (12%). The use in CML has declined rapidly since the introduction 
of highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  
Main indications in children are acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL; 26%), primary immunodeficiency (PID; 
16%), AML (14%), bone marrow failure (12%), thalassaemia (9%), and MDS/MPS (8%). 
AlloHSCT is the treatment of choice in adult and paediatric patients with high-risk AML in their first complete 
remission (CR1). In patients with standard or good risk features, alloHSCT is reserved for their second complete 
remission (CR2). AlloHSCT is the only curative option for patients with primary refractory or relapsed AML.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Patients undergoing alloHSCT are prepared with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with 
radiotherapy, the so-called conditioning regimen, with three aims: to reduce the tumour burden when the 
disease is neoplastic, to eliminate the self-renewing capacity of the patient’s own haematopoiesis, and to 
suppress the recipient’s immune system to allow engraftment of stem cells. Exceptions are infants with severe 
combined immune deficiency (SCID) and patients with severe aplastic anaemia with an identical twin donor who 
may be grafted without conditioning.  
Transplant-related mortality (TRM) after myeloablative regimens increases with increasing age, and to reduce 
toxicity non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning regimens were developed.  
Myeloablative conditioning does not allow autologous recovery and requires stem cell support whereas non- 
myeloablative regimens do not require stem cell support. Regimens that do not match these criteria have been 
classified as reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), whereby the dose of total body irradiation (TBI) or the 
alkylating agent is usually reduced by at least 30% compared with an ablative regimen. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Myeloablative radiation-containing conditioning regimens 
High dose total body irradiation (TBI), usually 12-16 Gray (Gy) has been widely used as part of the conditioning 
with other chemotherapeutic agents, most commonly cyclophosphamide (CY).  
Higher doses of TBI reduce the relapse risk but result in increased toxicity. Other agents such as cytarabine 
(AraC), etoposide (ETO), melphalan (MEL), and busulfan (BU), have been combined with TBI as conditioning 
regimens but there is currently no evidence suggesting that any of these combinations are superior to CY and 
high-dose TBI. 
Myeloablative conditioning regimens without radiation 
These regimens have primarily been developed for autologous transplantation, but they have also been used in 
the allogeneic setting. The primary advantage is reduced toxicity. Additionally, the regimen is easier to 
administer, and radiation can still be given to sites of prior disease following transplantation. Alkylating agents 
remain the mainstay of such regimens. 
Commonly used regimens are based on orally or intravenously BU and other cytotoxic agents. A regimen 
consisting of high-dose BU (16 mg/kg total dose) and CY (200 mg/kg total dose) was developed and modified 
(total CY dose was decreased to 120 mg/kg) and has been widely used. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 11/152 
  
  
 
Nonmyeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning regimens 
For patients with haematologic malignancies, an important contributing factor is a graft-versus-tumour (GvT) 
effect mediated by the allogeneic donor cells. This effect requires the permanent engraftment of donor-type 
immunocompetent cells, which does not necessarily require a myeloablative conditioning.  
Due to its lowered toxicity, NMA transplants can be appropriate for patients older than 55 years, which is a 
common upper limit for standard myeloablative transplantation as well as patients with co-morbidities that 
would exclude them from undergoing myeloablative transplantation. 
Fludarabine (FLU) has been widely used because it is highly immunosuppressive, has anti-tumour activity in 
haematologic malignancies and a low non-haematologic toxicity profile. Regimens that relied on FLU or lower 
doses of the conditioning agents are referred to as either NMA or RIC.  
NMA regimens may result in minimal cytopenias that do not require stem cell support whereas RIC regimens do 
require stem cell support.  
The optimum regimen remains to be defined and commonly used conditioning regimens are shown below. 
Examples of RIC and NMA conditioning regimens 
RIC regimens 
NMA regimens 
TBI ≤ 500 cGy as a single fraction or ≤ 800 cGy if 
fractionated 
FLU + CY + antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 
Total BU dose ≤ 9 mg/kg 
FLU + AraC + idarubicin 
Total melphalan (MEL) dose < 140 mg/m² 
Cladribine + AraC 
Thiotepa (TT) < 10 mg/kg 
Total lymphoid irradiation + ATG 
TBI ≤ 2 Gy ± purine analogue 
Complications of alloHSCT include:  
• 
Prolonged and severe pancytopenia that requires the use of antibiotics and blood cell transfusions. 
•  Graft rejection where donor cells fail to regenerate within the recipient. Mechanisms include the failure 
of immunosuppressive agents to inactivate the host immune system, inadequate ratio of donor cells to 
facilitator cells infused, drug injury to marrow, or viral infections.  
•  Graft versus host disease (GvHD) when immunocompetent T and natural killer cells in the donor graft 
recognise host antigens as foreign targets and mediate a reaction. The disease may cause significant 
morbidity and mortality and has been divided into acute and chronic forms.  
To avoid acute GVHD, patients are given potent immunosuppressives immediately before and for many 
months after transplantation.  
Around 50%-70% of patients develop chronic GVHD within ten years of treatment. It may develop as a 
continuation of active acute GvHD, after successful clearing of acute GvHD, or may appear without 
antecedent acute GvHD. The target organs are more widespread than in acute GvHD. Chronic GVHD is 
associated with fewer relapses, indicative of a GvT effect.

• 
Pulmonary complications like interstitial pneumonitis, often fatal and caused by viral infection, or lung 
injury due to TBI or pulmonary toxins (carmustine).  
•  Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, previously known as veno-occlusive disease manifests as 
jaundice, hepatomegaly, unexplained weight gain, or ascites. The condition usually develops by 30 days 
after HSCT, although it can occur later. Historically, its reported incidence ranges from approximately 5 
to 60%. Risk factors for this complication include a history of previous hepatocellular disease, certain 
conditioning regimens, advanced age, the presence of GvHD, the type of GvHD prophylaxis, poor 
performance status at transplantation, and the use of matched unrelated or mismatched donor grafts.  
• 
Late-onset problems include an increased risk of malignancy (often many years after transplant), 
infections (like reactivation of dormant herpes viruses), and gonadal dysfunction in up to 92% of men 
and 99% of women. The medications that transplant recipients need to take can impair liver function, 
and there is transfusion-associated haemosiderosis. Around 40% to 50% of patients suffer from lipid 
metabolic disturbances that increase the risk of myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial occlusive 
disease, and stroke. Their life expectancy is shorter than that of the overall population. 
Myeloablative conditioning is associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity and is usually 
contraindicated in patients with older age, with co-morbidities or patients with previous autologous SCT. Efforts 
have been made to reduce the toxicity of these regimens and non-myeloablative and RIC regimens expanded 
the patient population that could receive alloHSCT but at the expense of an increased relapse rate. 
About the product 
Treosulfan is a prodrug of a bifunctional alkylating agent with cytotoxic activity to haematopoietic precursor 
cells. The activity of treosulfan is due to the spontaneous conversion into a mono-epoxide intermediate and 
L-diepoxybutan. The epoxides formed alkylate nucleophilic centres of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are able 
to induce DNA cross-links which are considered responsible for the stem cell depleting and antineoplastic effects.  
The immunosuppressive effects of treosulfan are attributed to its toxicity against primitive and committed 
progenitor cells, T and NK cells, reduction of cellularity of primary and secondary lymphatic organs and a 
preclusive effect on the ‘cytokine storm’ that precedes the development of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD) 
and is involved in the pathogenesis of veno-occlusive disease.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as powder for solution for infusion containing 1 g or 5 g of treosulfan as active 
substance. The finished product contains no excipients. 
The product is available in type III glass vial, with rubber stopper and aluminium cap completed with plastic 
bottle holder as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of treosulfan is (2S,3S)-(-)-1,4-di(mesyloxy)-2,3-butanediol corresponding to the 
molecular formula C6H14O8S2. It has a relative molecular mass of 278.3 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of treosulfan was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) 
and x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white crystalline powder; it is freely soluble in acetone, soluble in 
water, sparingly soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in chloroform. 
Treosulfan exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. The chiral centres have the 
(S)-configuration and are introduced during the synthetic process with the starting material. Enantiomeric 
purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation.  
Polymorphism screening was performed and two polymorphic forms were observed. The most stable 
polymorphic form of treosulfan is consistently produced utilizing the intended commercial manufacturing 
process and it was demonstrated that it does not change during storage. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is obtained from a single manufacturer. It is synthesized in a convergent synthesis in 4 
main steps followed by a crystallisation step from well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Several synthesis intermediates are isolated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 14/152 
  
  
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Treosulfan is an anti-cancer medicine indicated for the treatment of severe and life-threatening diseases. 
Treosulfan and its active metabolites that form in vivo (monoepoxide and diepoxide) are themselves 
genotoxic/cancerogenic substances. The mechanism of action is based on the conversion of treosulfan to the 
epoxides which alkylate DNA resulting in the induction of DNA cross-links (as described in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC). The known related impurities of treosulfan are not expected to have a higher genotoxic potential than 
the active substance itself. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in antistatic LDPE bags which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. The LDPE bags are placed into fibre drums. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, melting point (Ph. Eur.), optical rotation (Ph. 
Eur.), identity (IR), assay (HPLC), clarity of the solution (Ph. Eur.), colour of the solution (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. 
Eur.), related substances (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: description, melting point, assay (HPLC), clarity of the solution, colour of 
the solution, pH, related substances, loss on drying and microbiology. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The results of the study 
show that treosulfan is not photosensitive. 
Results on stress conditions: high temperature study (solid state), hydrolysis study (in buffer solution used in 
the analytical method, in acidic conditions, in alkaline conditions) and an oxidation study (H2O2) were also 
provided on one batch. Treosulfan showed to be unstable under acidic conditions, with approximately a third of 
the sample being degraded into various products. Treosulfan is hydrolysed and degraded very quickly under 
alkaline conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 15/152 
  
  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white crystalline powder for solution for infusion containing 1 g or 5 g of 
treosulfan as active substance. The product is available in colourless type III glass vial, with rubber stopper and 
aluminium cap. The product is reconstituted in 0.45% sodium chloride solution. The reconstituted solution 
contains 50 mg treosulfan per 1 ml and appears as a clear colourless solution. 
Treosulfan was developed more than two decades ago and its use is well-established (e.g. medicinal product 
authorised and marketed in the EU for the indication “Palliative treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer” since 
1990s. The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a stable, sterile powder for solution for infusion 
formulation indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant and non-malignant diseases, and in paediatric 
patients older than one month with malignant diseases. 
Due to its solubility in water treosulfan is suitable for intravenous infusion after reconstitution. The addition of a 
solubilizing agent is not necessary. The compound is intended to be marketed as a pure dried substance that 
should be dissolved in sterile reconstitution medium immediately before administration. Especially for use in the 
paediatric population, 0.45 % NaCl solution should be used instead of WFI as reconstitution medium to gain an 
acceptable osmolality of the resulting treosulfan solution. Stability over a period of 48 h at room temperature 
was confirmed by provided stability results. 
The finished product contains no excipients; however a solvent and inert gas are used as excipients for 
production. 
The same polymorphic form is consistently obtained by the commercial manufacturing process of the finished 
product by slow and controlled crystallisation. The polymorph is thermodynamically very stable. It was further 
demonstrated on three batches of the active substance and the finished product that the polymorphic form does 
not change during storage. 
The compatibility of the active substance with excipients used for production is confirmed based on the finished 
product stability data. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant 
with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. As the excipients 
are not present in the finished product on administration, they are not included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The sterility of the powder is achieved by sterile filtration of the dissolved active substance and aseptic 
processing of the subsequent precipitation/drying and filling of the sterile powder in vials which are closed with 
rubber stoppers and sealed with safety caps. The active substance melts at approximately 100 ºC and the 
re-crystallisation after cooling occurs in an uncontrolled manner. Final sterilisation could only be performed 
below the melting point (90-95 ºC), which is not appropriate to ensure the inactivation of some microorganism 
and spores. Additionally, the active substance degrades when exposed to weak X-ray radiation, therefore 
sterilisation via gamma irradiation was also not deemed a feasible option. The choice of sterile filtration and 
aseptic process is considered appropriately justified, in line with CPMP/QWP/054/98 Corr “Decision trees for 
selection of sterilisation methods (Annex to note for guidance on development pharmaceutics)”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 16/152 
  
  
The formulation and the manufacturing process used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for 
marketing. 
An extractables study was performed and the chosen rubber material used for stoppers meets the quality 
requirements with regard to leachable compounds and related safety concerns. In addition, the proposed 
specification for the rubber stopper complies with the requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph and 
biocompatibility of the rubber formulation has been demonstrated. 
The absence of leachable studies using reconstituted treosulfan with 0.45% NaCl solution or WFI in the glass 
vials, PVC bags and PE bags was adequately justified. Representative data on the material or polymer type (e. 
g. glass, PE) have been generated which have proven the (physico)-chemical compatibility and serve as 
recommendation and instruction for their use. As demonstrated in the in-use study the used solvents and the 
used packaging materials have no apparent impact on the quality of the reconstituted solution.  
The primary packaging is type II glass vial, with rubber stopper and aluminium cap completed with plastic bottle 
holder. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of two main steps: in step 1 a sterile intermediate is produced and in step 
2  the  final  sterile  finished  product  is  manufactured.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
Stability studies have been performed on the sterile intermediate finished product packed in the proposed 
primary container and were found satisfactory. 
All manufacturing steps are well controlled by applied in-process controls which are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three commercial size 
batches  of  treosulfan  product  intermediate,  which  includes  the  preparation  of  the  solution,  sterile  filtration, 
precipitation, drying and packing into polyethylene bags. Five different lots of the active substance were used. 
The sterile powder filling of treosulfan into injection vials was validated on three batches for each presentation 
(1000 mg and 5000 mg). 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
uniformity of mass (Ph. Eur.), colour of solution (Ph. Eur.), clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter 
(visible) of solution (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (sub-visible) of solution (Ph. Eur.), reconstitution time 
(in-house), pH (Ph. Eur.), identity (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), loss on drying (in-house), residual 
solvents (GC), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC). 
A risk assessment to evaluate the presence of elemental impurities in the finished drug product has been 
performed in compliance with ICH Q3D. Provided data has shown that the content of all elemental impurities 
remains well below the control threshold (defined as 30%) of the established permitted daily exposure (PDE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 17/152 
  
  
Taking into account the provided summary of the risk assessment, additional controls for elemental impurities 
(i. e. in the finished product release specifications) was not required. 
It was demonstrated that the wider acceptance criteria for the pH value applied to the specification for the 
reconstituted solution is acceptable from a safety and efficacy point of view. 
A difference in the reconstitution time between the 1000 mg and 5000 mg strengths is expected and is 
considered acceptable. The variability of the reconstitution time is regarded as uncritical with regard to the 
clinical use of the product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches of each strength, confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 16 finished product batches (9 of 1 g strength and 7 of 5 g strength) of up to commercial 
scale stored for up to 72 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH), both in upright and inverted position, according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested against tests and acceptance criteria as listed in the release specifications, with the 
exception of bacterial endotoxins since this parameter is not considered stability indicating. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed and neither trends for increase nor for decrease of any parameter 
could be observed. 
A finished product intermediate holding time of 12 months was supported by data. 
A stability study after reconstitution of treosulfan to 50 mg/ml in 0.45 % NaCl solution (compared with 
reconstitution in WFI) was carried out using different containers. Over a period of 48 h storage in different 
containers at room temperature, for assay and impurities as well as appearance of treosulfan 50 mg/ml in 0.45 
% NaCl solution no trends can be observed. The pH-value decreases; however all results comply with the 
specification criteria. After reconstitution of treosulfan to 50 mg/ml in WFI, analogue results can be obtained. In 
the context of the in-use stability studies, the assay of treosulfan did not change over the 48 hours tested and 
a slight increase of an unknown impurity was observed. This impurity was then identified, showing that no new 
toxic impurities are formed in the reconstituted solution. 
The applicant has justified properly the absence of forced degradation testing and photostability study of the 
finished product, arguing that since the finished product is a recrystallized and sterile-filtered active substance 
without any additional pharmaceutical formulation, no matrix effects caused by excipients are expected. 
Additionally, the physical state of active substance and finished product is comparable (i. e. same 
polymorphism). Therefore, it is not expected that additional factors which could significantly influence 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 18/152 
  
  
photostability exist for the finished product and consequently the data for the active substance can be 
extrapolated for the finished product. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 5 years with no special storage conditions as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The anti-tumour activity and safety pharmacology of treosulfan was tested against transplanted mouse and rat 
lymphomas/leukaemias, sarcomas and hepatomas, human tumour xenografts, human tumour biopsies, and cell 
lines originated from solid tumours.  
The pharmacologically inactive prodrug treosulfan is transformed in vitro and in vivo to reactive intermediates 
with alkylating properties, in particular to a monoepoxide (EBDM) and a diepoxide (DEB) The kinetics, pH- and 
temperature-dependence of the transformation was studied in aqueous solutions. ADME (absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion) properties of treosulfan and/or metabolites were determined in vitro 
and in representative animal species. The potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions was investigated 
in vitro. 
Most of the toxicology information is derived from the published literature whilst other studies are presented as 
brief summaries of studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Mechanism of action (cytotoxicity) 
Treosulfan is a water-soluble prodrug, which under physiological conditions is converted nonenzymatically into 
reactive intermediates. This conversion is strongly pH- and temperature dependent. The intermediates, in 
particular epoxides, are responsible for alkylation and crosslinking of DNA and proteins and for subsequent 
interference with various cellular processes including apoptosis and genotoxicity. 
In treosulfan-treated cells of the human chronic myelogenous leukaemic cell line K562, DNA cross-links formed 
slowly, while incubation with preformed epoxides showed faster and more efficient cross-linking. Alkylation in 
plasmid DNA occurred at guanine bases with sequence selectivity similar to other alkylating agents such as the 
nitrogen mustards. 
The relative potency of the three stereoisomers of the diepoxide in producing DNA interstrand cross-links was 
found to be: S,S-DEB > R,R-DEB > meso-DEB; whereby only S,S-DEB can be formed from S,S-treosulfan. 
(2S,3S)-1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) formed DNA-protein cross-links between cysteine thiols within proteins 
and the N-7 guanine positions within DNA. 
DEB-mediated DNA-protein cross-linking was investigated in human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells. Over 150 
proteins including histones, high mobility group proteins, transcription factors, splicing factors, and tubulins 
were found among those covalently cross-linked to chromosomal DNA in the presence of DEB. A large portion of 
the cross-linked proteins are known factors involved in DNA binding, transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, 
DNA repair, and DNA damage response.  
While alkylating agents (melphalan, treosulfan) and doxorubicin demonstrated marked cytotoxicity, nucleotide 
analogs (gemcitabine, cytarabine) induced only limited apoptosis in human bone marrow stromal cells. 
Myeloablative and immunosuppressive effects 
Compared with other dimethanesulfonate compounds (related to busulfan), treosulfan exhibited relatively high 
in vitro activity, but relatively low activity in vivo in terms of their toxicity to different stem cell subsets. 
Myeloablative and immunosuppressive properties of treosulfan were investigated in mice treated with 
treosulfan, cyclophosphamide, or busulfan at sublethal doses that maintained survival without bone marrow 
support. Treosulfan and busulfan induced a high and persisting degree of myeloablation, as compared with 
cyclophosphamide. Moreover, treosulfan was more effective in depletion of splenic B and T cells in comparison 
with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Treatment with treosulfan induced only interleukin-2 production in spleen 
cells for a short time and had no significant effect on synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and/or interferon 
gamma as compared with that observed in splenic T cells isolated from mice treated with either busulfan or 
cyclophosphamide. 
The immunosuppressive activity of treosulfan was investigated using human peripheral blood B and T 
lymphocytes and mice immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Low dose treosulfan i) induced suppression 
of the early immune response, probably including the proliferation/differentiation of cells repopulating lymphoid 
organs and ii) influenced the balance of regulatory T cell subpopulations. 
Fractionated high-dose treosulfan or busulfan treatment was investigated in mice to prepare recipients for 
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. In addition, treosulfan and busulfan treatment regimens including 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 20/152 
  
  
concomitant treatment with anti-T cell antibodies and/or cyclophosphamide were assessed for induction of 
donor-type chimerism and tolerance to subsequent donor skin grafts after H-2 incompatible allogeneic HSCT. 
Concomitant treatment of the stem cell depleting agent (busulfan or treosulfan) with T cell depletion with 
anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies appeared to be important for achieving immune tolerance and 
induction of high levels of donor-type chimerism. Cyclophosphamide was, however, effective in enhancing low 
levels of donor chimerism produced by treosulfan-based conditioning regimen. Permanent acceptance of 
donor-type skin grafts and rejection of “third party” skin grafts after low dose treosulfan-based conditioning and 
allogeneic HSCT was demonstrated in mice. 
Anti-tumour effects (haematological malignancies) 
Treosulfan was tested in vitro by differential staining cytotoxicity assays against 55 specimens from patients 
with a variety of tumour types, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), adult T-cell 
leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Treosulfan induced dose-dependent cell death resulting in LC90 values of 2 to 
512 μg/mL. 
Treosulfan treatment of the myeloma cell lines NCI-H929 and U266 led to apoptosis in both cell lines in a dose- 
and time-dependent manner. 
Chemosensitivity tests were performed in AML cell lines and primary cells from patients. All cell types displayed 
dose-dependent sensitivity to treosulfan. 
In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
treosulfan, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, fludarabine or cytarabine, but not busulfan, were good inducers 
of apoptosis. Cell death was induced via caspase-activation. Cytotoxicity of treosulfan and busulfan was 
evaluated in vitro on two leukemia cell lines. Treosulfan was consistently more cytotoxic than busulfan. 
All samples of paediatric origin were tested for ex vivo chemosensitivity to various drugs. Their combined drug 
resistance profile was analysed. Lymphoblasts at multiple relapse were comparably resistant to daunorubicin, 
doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, treosulfan, fludarabine, clofarabine, and bortezomib. 
The in vivo antileukaemic activity of treosulfan was compared with the activity of equitoxic doses of 
cyclophosphamide or busulfan using a human ALL xenograft mouse model. Treosulfan was more effective with 
regard to the numbers of complete regressions and the number of cured animals. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology studies included effects of treosulfan on erythrocytes, on the migration of 
immunocompetent blood cells, and against solid tumour types. 
Exposure of human erythrocytes to treosulfan significantly stimulated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis at 
least in part by inducing oxidative stress and stimulating Ca2+ entry. 
Treatment of PBMCs of healthy donors with treosulfan significantly inhibited the migration of immunocompetent 
mononuclear cells across a fibronectin layer. The effect was observed in T cells (CD4+ and CD8+ cells) as well 
as in CD14+ monocytes to a similar extent. 
Apart from activity against haematological malignancies, treosulfan also exhibits a broad antitumour activity 
against numerous solid tumour types as demonstrated against human tumour xenografts in rats and mice, 
human tumour biopsies, and tumour cell lines.

Treosulfan was consistently more cytotoxic than busulfan when evaluated in vitro on four Ewing tumour, four 
neuroblastoma, and two osteosarcoma cell lines.

The effect of treosulfan on vital organ functions (cardiovascular system, respiratory system, central nervous 
system) as well as on supplemental organ functions (gastro-intestinal tract, blood) was investigated in vitro and 
in vivo. The orientating studies provided no evidence of adverse effects (maximum doses or concentrations 
tested are given in brackets): 
•  Cardiovascular system: blood pressure in rats (40 mg/kg i.v.), blood pressure and ECG in dogs (200 
mg/kg i.v.); 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 23/152 
  
  
 
 
 
•  Central nervous system: general behaviour of mice (300 mg/kg i.p.) and dogs (200 mg/kg p.o.); 
anticonvulsive and analgesic effects in mice (100 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg i.p.); 
•  Respiratory system: isolated tracheal muscle preparations of the cat (2 x 10-5 g/mL); 
•  Gastro-intestinal tract: gastric secretion in rats (50 mg/kg p.o.), isolated small intestine preparations of 
the guinea pig (10-5 g/mL); 
• 
Testing for a local anaesthetic effect in mice (tail, 0.05 mL of a 2 % treosulfan solution). 
Treosulfan exhibited no potential for a pro-arhythmogenic activity in a recent (2017) GLP-compliant in vitro test. 
The whole-cell patch-clamp technique (manual patch-clamping) was used to investigate the effects of treosulfan 
on hERG (human-ether-à-go-go related gene) stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Treosulfan was tested at one 
concentration of 1000 μM in order to determine compound effects on hERG mediated current. As the observed 
inhibition of the hERG tail current amplitude was less than 10%, no further concentrations were tested. 
Dose-dependent haematological changes were observed after i.v., i.p. or p.o. administration in mice, rats, dogs 
and monkeys. These effects are generally expected for alkylating agents. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Treosulfan was more active against leukemic cells of 20 paediatric patients as well as against three 
leukemia-derived cell lines than busulfan, with increasing IC50 values from initial diagnosis (chemotherapy 
naive specimens) to relapse (pretreated specimens). Overall, purified stem cells were most sensitive, followed 
by CD56+CD3- NK and CD3+ T cells. The combination of treosulfan with fludarabine resulted in a synergistic 
cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells. Conditioning treatment with treosulfan/fludarabine or 
busulfan/fludarabine resulted in decreased severity of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) compared to 
total body irradiation (TBI). Moreover, treosulfan/fludarabine was associated with improved immune 
reconstitution despite early gastro-intestinal or cutaneous toxicity. 
AML- or MDS-derived myeloid cell lines as well as primary marrow cells from patients with MDS and healthy 
donors were exposed to treosulfan, radiation or both, and the extent of apoptosis was assessed. Pre-exposure 
to treosulfan did not clearly enhance radiation-induced cell death. 
The combination of treosulfan with total body irradiation was investigated prior to bone marrow transplantation 
in rats. Treosulfan was shown to possess certain characteristics of a radiosensitizer. 
Low-dose treosulfan was added to an immune-suppressive regimen consisting of T cell-depleting antibodies, 
fludarabine, and thymic irradiation. The results indicate that low-dose treosulfan may be considered as a useful 
component of a truly nonmyeloablative conditioning protocol in providing for mixed haematopoietic chimerism 
of donor type and, consequently, in establishing a platform for adoptive immunotherapy. 
Permanent mixed chimerism and donor-specific tolerance was achieved in mice conditioned, prior to a donor 
mouse muscle precursor cell transplantation, with a treosulfan treatment combined with a single 
cyclophosphamide dose, and finally donor bone marrow transplantation. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Recent validated analytical procedures replaced the methods used early in the development of treosulfan as an 
anti-tumour agent. For kinetic determination of treosulfan, concentrations in plasma of juvenile rats and in 
sodium chloride solutions (application solution) the older high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
method with refractive index (RI) detection was validated. However, for the quantification of treosulfan and its 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 24/152 
  
  
epoxides in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain homogenate supernatant of rats, a new HPLC method 
with Electrospray Ionisation (ESI)-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS/MS) or UV-detection was 
developed. The selective and rapid HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method was also elaborated and validated for the studies 
of distribution of treosulfan and EBDM in rat plasma, liver, lungs, kidneys, muscle, and brain tissue. 
The total radioactivity in urine, faeces and expired air of rats was calculated by means of liquid scintillation 
counting following [3H]-treosulfan application. In addition, whole body autoradiography was performed to 
measure radioactivity in tissues and carcasses. 
Another HLPC-MS/MS method was optimised for the simultaneous determination of treosulfan and epoxides in 
plasma of children under clinical conditions. 
Absorption 
The route of administration of treosulfan is intravenous. 
The plasma pharmacokinetics (plasma concentrations of treosulfan and basic pharmacokinetic parameters after 
single administration were determined in mice (i.p.), rats (i.v.), rats (i.v.; juvenile, young adult and adult rats), 
rabbits (i.v.) and dogs (i.v., p.o.).

A comparative pharmacokinetic study in juvenile (post-natal day 10, PND 10) and young adult rats (PND 34/35) 
after a single i.v. bolus application of 500 mg/kg treosulfan revealed an elimination half-life of approximately 1 
hour in juvenile rats and approximately 40 minutes in young adult rats. Plasma levels of the monoepoxide EBDM 
were 24-fold to 44-fold lower than those of the parent compound and declined with an elimination half-life of 
approximately 1.3 hours for juvenile rats and approximately 40 minutes for young adult rats. Concentrations of 
the diepoxide DEB were below the limit of quantification. 
In another study in juvenile rats (PND 10), plasma peak levels of treosulfan were noted 5 minutes after i.v. 
administration of 10, 50 or 250 mg/kg. Plasma concentration declined with an elimination half-life ranging from 
1.1 to 1.4 hours for males and females, respectively. After daily application of treosulfan, no accumulation was 
noted.

In a pharmacokinetic study with i.v. administration, rabbits receiyved treosulfan, EBDM or DEB. The epoxides 
underwent a very rapid elimination with half-life of 0.069 and 0.046 hours associated with a high systemic 
clearance (10 and 14 L h-1 kg-1). After administration of treosulfan, the half-life of EBDM was statistically equal 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 26/152 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
to the half-life of the prodrug treosulfan (1.6 hours). These data demonstrate a formation-limited elimination of 
the epoxides with in vivo levels of EBDM and DEB being much lower than the parent compound due to the 
inherently high clearance of the epoxides. 
Distribution 
In human blood samples, the fraction unbound to plasma proteins was about 82% for the monoepoxide EBDM 
and for the diepoxide DEB. The unbound fraction in rat plasma was about 95% for treosulfan and about 100% 
for EBDM. 
Distribution of treosulfan and EBDM into plasma, liver, lungs, kidneys, muscle, and brain of adult rats was 
demonstrated after a single intraperitoneal administration of radio-labelled [3H]-treosulfan. In comparison with 
the parent drug, the levels of EBDM in the plasma and tissues were much lower. The lowest quantifiable levels 
of both compounds were observed in the brain tissue. Low blood-brain barrier permeability of treosulfan was 
confirmed in an in vitro model. 
The autoradiographic procedures may have resulted in extensive loss of volatile products (for example DEB), 
which may have been formed from treosulfan during sample processing. On this basis, derived data of the tissue 
distribution were not considered reliable. The data confirmed, however, that no covalently bound radioactivity 
was retained within the carcass about one week post dosing. 
After a single i.v. bolus application of treosulfan (Study  LPT 27700) the exposure of treosulfan in brain tissue of 
juvenile rats was approximately 3-fold higher and the overall elimination rate was slower compared to young 
adult rats. In addition exposure to S,S-EBDM in brain tissue was 5-6-fold higher in the juveniles as compared to 
the young adults.   
Concentrations of treosulfan and EBDM were determined in samples of plasma, liver, lungs, kidneys, muscle, 
and brain of adult rats after a single intraperitoneal administration of treosulfan. The two analytes could be 
determined in the biological matrices up to 6 hours after administration (except for EBDM in the liver); 
concentrations were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) in the samples collected at 24 hours. In 
comparison to the parent drug, the levels of EBDM in the plasma and tissues were much lower. Highest 
concentrations of treosulfan were observed in kidneys, and lowest quantifiable levels of treosulfan and EBDM 
were observed in the brain tissue. 
There is no information on the distribution of treosulfan or its metabolites into breast milk. 
Metabolism 
The prodrug treosulfan is converted under physiological conditions in two steps by nonenzymatic intramolecular 
arrangement into the monoepoxide (EBDM) and the diepoxide (DEB) The expoxides react with nucleophilic 
centers of biomolecules (alkylation), the basis the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential. Further transformation 
proceeds by non-enzymatic and enzymatic processes.

Figure 2 Conversion of treosulfan to biologically active epoxides (Source: Glowka et al., 2012) 
Metabolism / detoxification processes have been thoroughly investigated for DEB since this compound is also 
formed in vivo after exposure to the industrial chemical 1,3-butadiene. Glutathione (GSH) conjugation of DEB by 
liver cytosol from mice, rats, and humans was evaluated in vitro. Analysis indicated formation of two isomeric 
conjugates, which were rapidly hydrolyzed to the corresponding trihydroxy conjugates. The conjugation rates in 
mouse and rat liver cytosol were similar and one order of magnitude higher than in human liver cytosol. 
Diepoxibutane (DEB) disappeared rapidly from plasma and was only detectable up to 10 minutes after i.v. 
injection of DEB to one dog. Treosulfan was transformed non-enzymatically into its corresponding mono- and 
diepoxide (EBDM and DEB) with a half-life time of 2.2 hours.

1996) GST: glutathione S-transferase; EH: epoxide hydrolase.  
The formation of glutathione conjugates and erythritol was observed in human, rat, and mouse liver fractions. 
The formation of anhydroerythritol was only detected in human liver microsomes. 
Transformation proceeded according to a first order reaction. Hydrolysis of DEB is another important route of 
detoxification. Tissue preparations from rats, mice and human revealed that human liver is highly proficient in 
hydrolysis of DEB, while mouse liver has a relatively low hydrolytic capacity. Pulmonary hydrolysis was also 
most efficient in humans. 
Excretion 
Following i.v. injection of [3H]-treosulfan to rats, treosulfan was rapidly excreted into urine and faeces. Almost 
full recovery of radioactivity (91%) was found one day after dosing. Urinary recovery of treosulfan after i.v. and 
oral application to dogs was found to be 50% to- 60% within 8 hours. Neither EBDM nor DEB was detected in the 
urine. 
Pharmacology studies on drug interactions 
The inhibitory potency of treosulfan towards human CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, 
CYP3A4) was investigated in human liver microsomes using a standard set of CYP isoform-selective substrates 
and pre-incubation with pooled human liver microsomes and a NADPH regenerating system. There was no 
indication of an inhibitory effect of treosulfan in the dose range tested, 1 to 100 μM. Specific information on 
enzyme induction and inhibition of transporters by treosulfan is not available.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Table 4 Single dose toxicity 
The prodrug treosulfan was found to have much lower acute toxicity compared to the directly alkylating agent 
busulfan. This difference can be explained by the rapid detoxification and rapid elimination of toxic metabolites 
in the case of treosulfan 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study results are derived from the published literature whilst other studies are presented as brief summaries of 
studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s.   
Following repeated administration of treosulfan to rats, dogs or monkeys, the targets of toxicity were the 
haematopoietic and the lymphatic systems. The observed changes in the cellularity of the bone marrow and 
peripherial blood and in the spleen and lymph nodes appear to be a manifestation of the target toxicity. Evidence 
of cytotoxicity were the haemorrhages in various tissues and functional changes in the reproductive system 
(gonads, sperm, ovaries). Based on overt signs of toxicity and gross pathology findings, haemorrhagic lesions 
appear to be dose-limiting and were most pronounced in dogs. Emesis and diarrhoea was occasionally observed 
in the monkey studies. 
The applicant states that observations described as “CNS-depression” and “malaise” in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in dogs and monkeys are considered as signs of an impact on the general health condition, rather than 
signs of neurotoxicity. These studies were conducted in 1978 and these findings were not further explained. The 
applicant’s interpretation is corroborated by the fact that these symptoms were only noted in animals that died 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 30/152 
  
  
 
or were sacrificed in a moribund condition. There was no indication for effects on CNS-functions in the safety 
pharmacology studies and in juvenile rats after repeated dosing. 
Signs of minor toxicity occurred in the study with juvenile rats with a maximum intravenous dose of 100 
mg/kg/day. A slightly decreased ALAT plasma activity (-20% to -30%) is considered toxicologically not relevant 
in the absence of evidence for corresponding signs of organ dysfunctions or morphological tissue lesions. 
A NOAEL for treosulfan of 50 mg/kg/day was determined in the juvenile rat toxicity study. In the other 
repeat-dose studies, adverse effects were observed at the lowest dose tested. For both routes of administration, 
i.v. and p.o., the lowest dose tested was 56 mg/kg/day in dogs and monkeys in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regarding severe toxicity including lethality after repeated intravenous 
administration was 100 mg/kg/day in juvenile rats, 111 mg/kg/day in dogs and monkeys.  
In the 5-day rat study, an intraperitoneal dose of 278 mg/kg/day was tolerated without severe toxicity. 
Overall, the toxicity following treosulfan administration seems to be similar among the animal species tested and 
was generally independent from the route of administration. The potential for complete reversibility of 
haematological effects and effects on reproductive organs within 5 weeks after repeated dosing over 3 to 4 
weeks was demonstrated in the study on juvenile rats.

Carcinogenicity 
Based on its mechanism of action, treosulfan is considered as a genotoxic carcinogen. Due to sufficient evidence 
in humans, treosulfan was considered by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Groups 
as “carcinogenic to humans (Group 1)”. (IARC, 2012) Therefore, carcinogenicity studies in animals were 
deemed not necessary. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A potential for an influence on reproductive performance and intrauterine development in humans can be 
assumed based on the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of treosulfan. Therefore, no dedicated reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies for treosulfan according to current regulatory guidance were conducted. 
A number of studies specifically addressed effects of treosulfan and metabolites on male and 
female reproductive organs and functions.  
Toxicokinetic data 
There was one dedicated toxicokinetic study as part of the study in juvenile and young adult rats with i.v. 
administration (described above).

Excluding the logKow values (≤4.5), calculated separately for the pro-drug and its metabolites (EBDM or DEB), 
the biodegradable results as well as the refined PEC surface water value were presented regarding the treosulfan 
as the test material. Nevertheless, the available PK data in animals and patients indicate that EBDM or DEB are 
not unchanged excreted, but probably bind to the tissues proteins and DNA due to their alkylating activity. It has 
been suggested that the epoxides are decomposed to hydroxy-derivatives like threitol and renally excreted. 
Plasma concentrations of the active epoxides in humans are about 50-fold to 100-fold less compared to the 
parent compound.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for further investigation: 
-  Unchanged treosulfan itself is excreted to approx. 25-40% of the administered dose in urine and there 
is  no  evidence  (e.g.  in  the  SmPC)  that  excreta  of  treated  patients  will  be  collected  in  hospitals  and 
consequently is expected to enter WWTs via domestic sewage. Data show that treosulfan is not readily 
biodegradable  (elimination  of  30-40%  in  WWT).  Hence,  unchanged  treosulfan  will  enter  the  aquatic 
environment, albeit in rather low quantities. This might pose a concern if treosulfan is taken up by other 
organisms and converted into the active and highly toxic metabolites under physiological conditions. 
Therefore, the applicant should discuss the possible exposure of aquatic organisms to treosulfan and in

particular  its  conversion  into  the  active  metabolites  in  other  organisms  than  mammals  in  the 
environment and as to whether effects are to be expected. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Treosulfan is a prodrug. The parent compound is converted under physiological conditions by non-enzymatic 
processes into reactive intermediates via formation of a monoepoxide and a diepoxide. The reactive 
intermediates alkylate DNA and create interstrand cross-links. Alkylation also affects other biological molecules 
and structures involved in various physiological functions and thus contributes to the general cytotoxicity. 
In studies in which treosulfan was used alone or in combination with other conditioning regimens myeloablative 
and immunosuppressive effects were shown in various in vitro and in vivo models. 
The haematopoietic stem cell toxicity against both committed and primitive haematopoietic stem cells, as well 
as its immunosuppressive and haematotoxic characteristics, indicated the potential usefulness of treosulfan for 
conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic HSCT. 
The safety pharmacology studies provided no evidence of clinically relevant adverse effects. 
Basic pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mice, rats, dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Dedicated toxicokinetic studies were carried out in juvenile and young adult rats. There was no evidence for an 
accumulation in blood or tissues after repeated exposure. The ratio of treosulfan concentrations in brain versus 
plasma was very low, consistent with the lack of CNS-related toxicity. In juvenile rats, the plasma half-life was 
slightly prolonged and the exposure was higher compared to young adults when dosed intravenously on a mg/kg 
body weight calculation. The applicant has provided a scientifically plausible explanation for these findings and 
addressed their clinical relevance. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with intravenous treosulfan administrations were performed in dogs and monkeys. 
Changes in the cellularity of the bone marrow and peripheral blood (pancytopenia) as well as in the spleen and 
lymph nodes were a manifestation of the haematotoxic property of treosulfan. Further consequences of the 
cytotoxicity were haemorrhages in various tissues and functional changes in the reproductive system. 
Gastro-intestinal effects including emesis and diarrhoea were observed occasionally in the animal studies. The 
potential for complete reversibility of haematological effects and effects on reproductive organs within 5 weeks 
after repeated sublethal dosing over 3 to 4 weeks was demonstrated in the study on juvenile rats. Overall, the 
systemic toxicity upon treosulfan administration appeared to be similar among the animal species employed in 
the toxicity studies and generally independent from the route of administration. 
Treosulfan is genotoxic. Due to the genotoxic properties, there is a risk of secondary malignancies after 
treatment with treosulfan. Treosulfan is classified as a human carcinogen. Therefore, no carcinogenicity studies 
in animals have been performed. 
An adverse effect on reproductive performance and intrauterine development in humans at clinical relevant 
doses can be assumed based on the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of treosulfan. Therefore, no dedicated 
studies were conducted. There is also a risk of an accumulation of genetic damage in sperm and heritable 
chromosomal aberrations of paternal origin. Pregnancy is a contraindication in section 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC. 
In section 4.6 the SmPC states that women of child bearing potential have to use effective contraception during 
and up to 6 months after treatment. Furthermore, the SmPC states that treosulfan might impair fertility in men 
and women.

In line with the Questions and Answers on “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use” EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010, an ERA for both treosulfan and/or the active 
metabolites was provided taking into account the specific properties of the substances.  Considering the low PEC 
value, the available PK data and the environmental minimisation measures introduced in SmPC for this 
medicinal product, the ERA is accepted. 
Most of the study results are derived from the published literature whilst other studies are presented as brief 
summaries of studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Recently conducted nonclinical studies e.g. requested 
by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency are in compliance with GLP regulations. 
In view of the fact that treosulfan is mutagenic, cytotoxic, carcinogenic and toxic to reproduction, and in view of 
its established clinical use for decades as well as the extensive experience with other alkylating agents, further 
non-clinical studies are not warranted. 
The applicant performed a refined PEC surface water for the pro-drug and its metabolites, for which a value 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L was determined. In addition, studies regarding: 1) the log Kow for treosulfan, 
monoepoxide (EBDM) and diepoxide (DEB), 2) a biodegradability test and 3) PK data in animals and patients, 
were included in the present assessment. It has been concluded by the applicant that the active substance and 
both metabolites are unlikely to represent a risk for the environment. Unchanged treosulfan itself is excreted to 
approx. 25-40% of the administered dose in urine and there is no evidence (e.g. in the SmPC) that excreta of 
treated patients will be collected in hospitals and consequently is expected to enter WWTs via domestic sewage. 
Data show that treosulfan is not readily biodegradable (elimination of 30-40% in WWT). Hence, unchanged 
treosulfan will enter the aquatic environment, albeit in rather low quantities. This might pose a concern if 
treosulfan is taken up by other organisms and converted into the active and highly toxic metabolites under 
physiological conditions. The applicant discussed the possible exposure of aquatic organisms to treosulfan and 
in particular its conversion into the active metabolites in other organisms than mammals in the environment and 
as to whether effects are to be expected; this concern was resolved.

Absorption  
Treosulfan is administered through IV route, therefore bioavailability and effect of food were not studied. 
Distribution 
According to the literature data, treosulfan has negligible plasma protein binding [Glowka 2012; Schwarzner 
2017]. The volume of distribution at steady state from different studies was reported to range from 22.1 ± 3.8 
to 50.4 ± 43.9 L. According to the final population PK analysis, treosulfan volumes of distribution were 19 ± 1.7 
L and 20.3 ± 1.5 L for central and peripheral volumes of distributions, respectively.

Elimination 
Treosulfan is mainly excreted renally. The range of renal excretion expressed as % of total dose ranged between 
14 -42% in different studies. 
The metabolism of TREO was investigated by Feit et al. Treosulfan has no activity per se but needs 
transformation into epoxide derivatives to have a cytotoxic activity. At pH-values below 6 and a temperature of 
20°C in vitro, almost no transformation of TREO occurs. However, under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 
temperature 37°C), TREO is converted spontaneously (nonenzymatically) into an active monoepoxide 
intermediate (S,S-EBDM = (2S,3S)-1,2- epoxybutane-3,4-diol-4-methanesulfonate) and finally to 
L-diepoxibutane (S,S-DEB = (2S,3S)- 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane) [Feit 1970].

Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
With respect to the shape of the mean plasma concentration-time profiles of TREO and its monoepoxide 
metabolite, no major differences were observed between the age groups or BSA groups. Maximum TREO 
concentrations were reached directly after end of the infusion. The individual PK profiles were similar in shape 
and magnitude, independent of age group or BSA group. Decline of TREO concentrations after the end of 
infusion was bi-exponentially. Monoepoxide levels were about 10% of the parent compound TREO.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
No deviations from dose proportionality or indications of time dependent PK were identified during the model 
development. Regression analysis of AUC versus TREO dose indicated linear pharmacokinetics (r² = 0.9227).

Covariate model of Treosulfan 
Since the Dosing Model described historical data adequately and the current dosing scheme was based on BSA, 
the effect of BSA on CL, V1 and V2 was retained when additional covariate-parameter relations were tested.

In order to investigate potential relation between exposure (AUC) and engraftment, model predicted AUC’s were 
subjected to a graphical analysis (AUC’s are calculated according historical assay results). 
Visual inspection revealed no relation between AUC and time to engraftment in the investigated range of AUC’s. 
Applying linear regression did not show a significant change of time to engraftment as function of AUC either 
(p-value = 0.197). 
Treosulfan appears to have linear PK with dose proportional increase in AUC after IV administration.

In vitro 
The effect of treosulfan upon human CYP450 activities in vitro has been investigated by incubating TREO with 
pooled human liver microsomes in the presence of chemical substrates selective for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 
and 3A4 catalysed reactions. To investigate whether treosulfan could be metabolically-activated, via microsomal 
metabolism, into an inhibitory species (metabolite) during the course of the incubations, treosulfan was 
pre-incubated for one hour in the presence of pooled human liver microsomes and NADPH at 37°C, prior to 
starting metabolic reactions. The rate of metabolic reactions with assays for CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 were 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 44/152 
  
  
 
 
unaffected in the presence of treosulfan at concentrations up to 100 μM. With CYP2C19, some reduction in 
enzyme activity (ca. 25% inhibition) was observed up to 30 μM treosulfan. However, this was not reflected at 
the higher treosulfan concentration of 100 μM, where there was no inhibition evident. 
Therefore, taking into account the magnitude of the effect seen at 30 μM treosulfan and the lack of an overall 
dose-response relationship, these data suggest that treosulfan does not inhibit CYP2C19 activity. In assays for 
CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4, the respective enzyme activities (metabolite formation) were markedly reduced in 
the presence of known chemical inhibitors of these enzymes (furafylline, sulphaphenazole, quinidine and 
ketoconazole, respectively). A suitably selective chemical inhibitor of CYP2C19 enzyme is not available. These 
data illustrate that the incubation conditions used in this study were capable of supporting and hence 
demonstrating CYP-mediated inhibitory interactions. Therefore, a lack of treosulfan -derived CYP450-inhibitory 
interactions in this study indicates that TREO does not act as an inhibitor of human CYP450 activity in vitro [Cole 
2003]. In conclusion, treosulfan is not metabolised in the liver. Therefore, pharmacokinetic interactions with 
medicinal products metabolised in the liver are unlikely. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Treosulfan is a "prodrug" of a bifunctional alkylating cytotoxic drug. Under physiological conditions an 
intra-molecular reaction occurs spontaneously (non-enzymatically), converting the pharmacologically inactive 
treosulfan into an active monoepoxide intermediate and finally to L-diepoxibutane. The derived epoxides react 
with nucleophilic centres of biological molecules, like proteins or DNA, and are responsible for antineoplastic 
activity. Molecular DNA-interaction of treosulfan and its transformation products show a preferential guanine-N7 
alkylation, covalent inter-strand crosslinking of DNA, and potent concentration and time-dependent 
cross-linking activity. Irreversible DNA double-strand breaks are formed.  These activities are determined by the 
stereo chemical structure of treosulfan (L-configuration). The D- or meso- configurated isomers are far less 
active. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Treosulfan has a broad antineoplastic and antileukaemic activity. Antineoplastic activity was demonstrated in 
non-clinical studies in lymphomas/leukaemias, sarcomas and hepatomas, human tumour xenografts, human 
tumour biopsies and cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxic effects against various human tumour cells showed it was 
especially active against leukaemic cells at concentrations several fold below clinically achievable plasma levels.  
The safety profile of single agent treosulfan in conventional doses from its use in patients with ovarian cancer 
(up to 8 g/m² given every three to four weeks) is well-known and the most commonly reported undesirable 
effects are myelosuppression and gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting), usually mild and resolve after 
treatment. Safety non-clinical pharmacology studies did not show clinically relevant functional changes in the 
cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system and there were no dose-limiting effects on liver and 
kidneys.  
Treosulfan is not able to cross the brain barrier unlike busulfan, which is known to cause undesirable effects of 
the nervous system.  
GvHD is commonly observed after alloHSCT although it is considered not related to treosulfan but to the 
engraftment of the allogeneic immune system. How much the conditioning regimen influences the frequency 
and severity of GvHD is not known. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 45/152 
  
  
PD interactions 
Synergistic cytotoxic effects against paediatric leukaemic cells were demonstrated for the combination of 
treosulfan and fludarabine.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Concentration-response relationship was investigated within the Pop-PK study. The AUCs of three patients for 
which engraftment was not established were in the same range as AUCs of subjects for which engraftment was 
established. No correlation between AUC and time to engraftment in the investigated range of AUCs was seen. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
All studies presented have been performed in patient populations with no studies in healthy subjects. The 
analytical methods used were different between different studies. The bioanalytical methods for treosulfan and 
its epoxide derivatives in the clinical studies are adequately validated and are suitable for their purposes. Assay 
performance, in terms of inter-assay precision and inter-assay relative error was considered acceptable. 
The pharmacokinetics methods used for calculating PK parameters and renal clearance of treosulfan is 
acceptable. A population PK model was developed using FOCE with interaction estimation method using 
NONMEM software. The model was fitted to two compartments with linear intercompartmental clearance and 
elimination. The population PK objectives were clear with appropriate description of the nature of the data to be 
analysed. The general modelling aspects including software, estimation methods and diagnostics were properly 
reported. The statistical methods used are appropriate for summarising the PK data. 
Treosulfan is administered through IV route, therefore bioavailability and effect of food were not studied. 
According to the literature data, treosulfan has negligible plasma protein binding [Glowka 2012; Schwarzner 
2017]. The volume of distribution at steady state from different studies was reported to range from 22.1 ± 3.8 
to 50.4 ± 43.9 L. According to the final population PK analysis, treosulfan volumes of distribution were 19 ± 1.7 
L and 20.3 ± 1.5 L for central and peripheral volumes of distributions, respectively. Treosulfan is mainly 
excreted renally. The range of renal excretion expressed as % of total dose ranged between 14 -42% in different 
studies. Treosulfan does not undergo enzymatic metabolism. A pH-dependent non-enzymatic conversion to the 
active epoxide derivatives is responsible for the observed cytotoxic activity of treosulfan. The PK of the 
treosulfan metabolite, the monoepoxide metabolite is similar to the parent drug with similar t1/2 and Tmax. 
However, the exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC) appears to be ~30x lower than the parent drug. The 
consequences of possible genetic polymorphisms are not relevant as treosulfan does not appear to be substrate 
for any enzymatic metabolism. Treosulfan appears to have linear PK with dose proportional increase in AUC after 
IV administration. The PK parameters of treosulfan were similar after single and repeated dose administration 
indicating that treosulfan PK is not time dependent. In addition, there was no evidence of accumulation for 
treosulfan. The inter-individual variability was investigated using model independent and model dependent 
methods. The CV% was low (i.e <30%) for all the PK parameters using the model independent approach. 
However, the CV% was high (i.e > 80%) for t1/2 and Vss using the model dependent approach. 
An updated population PK model for treosulfan was developed and fitted treosulfan PK to a two-compartment 
model with linear elimination and intercompartmental clearance. The covariate model tested number of 
covariates including BSA, data indicator, sex, age and renal function. The final model retained only BSA effect on 
Q, Cl, V1 and V2. The population PK model estimated all structural and random effects parameters with 
acceptable precision. The VPC predictions intervals showed acceptable fit with observed data, however the 
model under-predicted the observed concentrations in subjects with BSA larger than 1 m2. The bootstrap results 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 46/152 
  
  
showed good agreement with the final model. The distribution of predicted AUCs showed that <1.2% are outside 
the target AUC range. The model results suggested a higher dose than currently planned for children with a BSA 
of 0.4, 0.5, 0.9 and 1.0 m2. The model predicted AUCs showed no correlation with time to engraftment. 
The applicant did not provide data to describe treosulfan PK in different stages of renal impairment. However, 
treosulfan SmPC indicates that patients with renal impairment are generally excluded from alloHSCT which 
provides justification for absence of data and dose recommendation in patients with renal impairment. 
Treosulfan and its active epoxide metabolites are not subject to hepatic metabolism. Therefore, it is unlikely for 
hepatic impairment to have significant effect on treosulfan PK and the PK of its metabolites. Additionally, the 
treosulfan SmPC indicates that patients with hepatic impairment are generally excluded from alloHSCT which 
provides justification for absence of data and dose recommendation in patients with hepatic impairment. There 
was no observed effect for gender on treosulfan PK and it was not identified as a covariate in the pop PK model. 
The applicant did not provide data about the effect of race on treoosulfan PK, however, the race effect on 
treosulfan PK is not expected according to the applicant as treosulfan is not subject to any PK processes affected 
by race. Using population PK approach, body weight was found to be highly correlated with BSA, therefore only 
BSA was considered for the forward-backward covariate analysis. BSA was found to be a significant covariate on 
treosulfan clearance and volumes of distributions which supports the BSA based dosing scheme suggested by 
the applicant. The PK parameters appeared similar between patients < 50 years and ≥ 50 years which indicates 
that treosulfan PK is unlikely to be altered in old age. 
The exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC) were comparable in different paediatric age and BSA groups which 
supports the current dose scheme proposed by the applicant. Tmax and T1/2 were comparable to the values 
reported in the adult population. As expected in paediatric population, volumes of distributions increased with 
increasing age and BSA. Based on the data provided by the applicant, the Cmax of treosulfan in adult studies 
after IV infusion of 10-14 g/m² ranged between 181 ± 36 and 597 ± 94 μg/mL, while the Cmax in paediatric 
population after IV infusion of 10-14 g/m² ranged between 566 ± 160 and 704 ± 318 μg/mL. 
Treosulfan was not a time dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4 using midazolam and testosterone as substrates. However, using midazolam as the substrate, 
treosulfan was a reversible inhibitor for CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 with IC50 values of 972 and 1870 μM, 
respectively. These two IC50 values are within or lower than the expected Cmax of treosulfan in adult studies 
after IV infusion of 10-14 g/m² which ranged between 181 ± 36 and 597 ± 94 μg/mL (~ 650 – 2145 μM), while 
the Cmax was higher in paediatric population after IV infusion of 10-14 g/m² and ranged between 566 ± 160 
and 704 ± 318 μg/mL (~2033 – 2592 μM). Therefore, the possibility of DDIs through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 
cannot be precluded. 
Although treosulfan caused a statistically significant decrease in CYP3A4 mRNA expression in cryopreserved 
human hepatocytes. However, no induction was observed in any of the donors. Therefore, treosulfan cannot be 
considered as an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.  
Treosulfan has been determined to be an inhibitor of probe substrate transport mediated via P-gp and MATE2-K, 
but not via BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OCT1, MATE1 and BSEP. 
The applicant is kindly asked to further discuss the observed inhibitory effect of treosulfan on CYP3A4, CYP2C19, 
P-gp and MATE2. Meanwhile, as the in vitro studies did not exclude the potential for DDIs between treosulfan 
and CYP3A4, CYP2C19, P-gp substrates, therefore, cautionary wording (e.g. special warnings and precautions 
for use) is required in the SmPC until additional evidence can be provided to exclude an interaction.

Treosulfan is a "prodrug" of a bifunctional alkylating cytotoxic drug. Under physiological conditions an 
intra-molecular reaction occurs spontaneously (non-enzymatically), converting the pharmacologically inactive 
treosulfan into an active monoepoxide intermediate and finally to L-diepoxibutane. 
Treosulfan has a broad antineoplastic and antileukaemic activity. Antineoplastic activity was demonstrated in 
non-clinical studies in lymphomas/leukaemias, sarcomas and hepatomas, human tumour xenografts, human 
tumour biopsies and cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxic effects against various human tumour cells showed it was 
especially active against leukaemic cells at concentrations several fold below clinically achievable plasma levels.  
The safety profile of single agent treosulfan in conventional doses from its use in patients with ovarian cancer 
(up to 8 g/m² given every three to four weeks) is well-known and the most commonly reported undesirable 
effects are myelosuppression and gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting), usually mild and resolve after 
treatment. 
Treosulfan is not able to cross the brain barrier unlike busulfan, which is known to cause undesirable effects of 
the nervous system. Bone marrow depression and immunosuppression can lead to infections which are a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality of transplant patients. 
Concentration-response relationship was investigated within the Pop-PK study. The AUCs of three patients for 
which engraftment was not established were in the same range as AUCs of subjects for which engraftment was 
established. No correlation between AUC and time to engraftment in the investigated range of AUCs was seen. 
Treosulfan primary activity fulfils the requirements for a conditioning agent for alloHSCT. It has sufficient 
antineoplastic effect to eradicate the underlying disease whilst its immunosuppressive and myeloablative 
activities contribute to the achievement of stable transplant engraftment, complete donor-type chimerism and 
prevention of GvHD. 
The combination of TREO/FLU/thiotepa (TT) has been proposed as an option in the paediatric indications. In 
paediatric patients TT is commonly used as part of conditioning to ensure engraftment, especially in 
non-malignant diseases that have a high risk of graft rejection. TT has no extramedullary toxicity.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology information is adequate. 
The applicant has acknowledged CHMP recommendations and will  submit any available clinical DDI data on 
CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and P-gp interactions as PAM. Due to the non-feasibility of DDI clinical studies in healthy 
volunteers (as the drug is highly cytotoxic), alternative approaches (e.g. PBPK and popPK modelling) might be 
acceptable.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose response study MC-FludT.6/L 
This was a non-randomised, non-controlled, dose response phase II study conducted to evaluate the feasibility 
and tolerability of a treosulfan-based conditioning regimen prior to allogeneic HSCT in patients with a 
haematological chemosensitive malignancy indicated for an allogeneic transplantation, but with an increased 
toxicity risk for classical (high-dose busulfan or standard-dose total body irradiation) conditioning therapies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 48/152 
  
  
Study period: December 2001 – June 2005. 
This study was conducted at seven centres in Germany, Finland, Poland and Sweden. 
Treatment regimen 
Non-clinical data had shown that a fractionated dose of TREO (up to 7.5 g/m² on three consecutive days) induce 
a stem-cell toxicity comparable to BU. Since TREO had a high cytotoxic effect on primitive and committed stem 
cells, an allogeneic transplantation was successfully performed without the need to add cyclophosphamide. 
Therefore, TREO was always administered on three consecutive days in all clinical trials. In addition, FLU had 
already been incorporated into non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens because it inhibits 
DNA repair, has activity against lymphoid neoplasms, favourable toxicity profile and immunosuppressive 
properties. A previous pilot clinical study used a conditioning of 10 g/m²/d TREO (day -6 to -4) with FLU 
(30 mg/m²/d; day -6 to -2) in patients with various haematological malignancies and the regimen was reported 
to be well tolerated and effective. 
Since sustained engraftment could be expected after administration of 10 g/m²/d × 3 and due to the malignant 
nature of the underlying disease, a dose escalation of TREO to 12 and 14 g/m²/d was used. Based on maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) in the autologous setting, it was not planned to exceed the TREO dose beyond 42 g/m² 
(14 g/m²/d × 3). 
So three doses of treosulfan (10, 12, 14 g/m²) IV infusion over 2 hours on 3 consecutive days (day –6 to day –
4 ) were selected. In addition, fludarabine (30 mg/m²) was infused over 30 minutes after treosulfan to all 
patients from day -6 to day -2. 
Stem cell donors were either HLA-identical siblings (MRD) or HLA-identical unrelated (MUD) or one mismatch 
(out of the 6 standard markers) siblings (1 misMRD). 
A sample size of 15 patients per cohort was planned and patients were consecutively enrolled for each of the 3 
dose group cohorts.  The decision for dose escalation was based on the occurrence of pre-defined toxicities and 
general judgment of the safety committee.   
Endpoints: 
o  Engraftment: regeneration of granulopoiesis in peripheral blood (> 0.5 × 109/L neutrophilic granulocytes 
on the first of three consecutive days) 
o  Primary failure of engraftment: granulocyte count < 0.5 x 109/L on day +28 after transplantation 
o  Secondary failure of engraftment: disappearance of donor cells from the blood (granulocyte count < 0.5 x 
109/L) after initial engraftment 
o  Disease status for the underlying disease according to standard criteria  
o  Donor-type chimerism in the recipient in BM and/or PB (complete chimerism if donor cells > 90%)

Assessment of time course and stability of donor-type haematopoiesis in the peripheral blood and bone marrow 
up to 6 months after transplantation. 
In addition, AE, laboratory parameters, GvHD, transplant related mortality (TRM) and non- relapse mortality 
(NRM) were evaluated for safety assessment. 
The protocol was not planned to define a MTD of treosulfan or to assess statistically significant differences of 
safety or efficacy parameters between the three dose groups. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive analyses were based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) stratified by treosulfan dosage and –if 
appropriate- by MRD vs. MUD-transplantation and CR vs. non-CR patients, respectively. Time-to-event data 
were analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods, log-rank tests were applied for exploratory comparisons of 
treatment groups. In case of competing events, nonparametric conditional and unconditional cumulative 
incidences were estimated, and comparisons were made using the test of Gray.  
Results  
Fifty six patients were enrolled, one patient was excluded from analysis (major protocol deviation) and 55 
patients comprise the FAS for safety and efficacy. 
Practically all patients (98 %) were considered non-eligible to standard conditioning regimens. Patients suffered 
from various haematological malignancies (AML: 35 %, mature B-cell neoplasms incl. MM and NHL: 36 %, MDS: 
11 %, CML: 11 %, ALL: 4 %, T- and NK-cell neoplasms: 2 %) and had a median age of 50 years (range: 18 – 
66 years). 
Matched-related donor (47 %) and MUD (51 %) transplantations (with additional ATG-treatment in case of 
MUD) were allowed for patients in CR (42 %) or non-CR (51 %) at study entry.

Safety evaluations allowed no definite conclusions concerning any consistent relationship to treosulfan dose. 
Overall frequencies of grade III/IV AE categories mucositis/stomatitis, diarrhoea, hyperbilirubinemia and 
seizures were low (< 10%). No case of severe/life-threatening veno-occlusive disease (VOD) was reported. The 
two cases of severe/life-threatening seizures were not related to the conditioning regimen itself. 
The higher incidence of NRM and TRM in 14 g/m2 dose group should be viewed with caution, as this cohort was 
characterised by some poor prognostic features (e.g. comparably higher median duration of study disease, 
higher percentage of patients with > 2 pre-treatment lines, higher percentage of patients with MUD 
transplantation). 
The data revealed that the conditioning treatment was tolerable and effective at all three dose levels. As the 
highest dosage (14 g/m²/d × 3) was safe with respect to Day +28 toxicity and to optimise efficacy against the 
underlying malignant disease, this dose was chosen for subsequent clinical trials.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare EFS within 2 years after transplantation between treosulfan based 
conditioning and busulfan-based conditioning. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary 
o  Event-free survival (EFS) within 2 years after transplantation, measured from time of end of HSCT (= 
day 0) to time of event. Events were defined as relapse of disease, graft failure or death (whatever 
occurred first). 
A primary graft failure required on Day +28 after transplant a neutrophil count ≤ 0.5 x 109/L and total 
WBC count ≤ 1 x 109/L (without previous engraftment or relapse/persisting disease), and donor-type 
chimerism of < 10% in bone marrow (BM). 
A secondary graft failure was documented in case a sustained decline of neutrophil counts ≤ 0.5 x 109/L 
and a total WBC count of ≤ 1 x 109/L was found in peripheral blood (PB) after initial engraftment, but in 
the absence of relapse or other conditions considered responsible for temporary decline of values. 
Secondary 
o  Relapse/progression incidence (RI) within 2 years of HSCT. 
o  Overall survival (OS) as survival irrespective of disease status at any point in time within 2 years after 
HSCT. 
o  Non-relapse mortality (NRM) as dying without previous occurrence of a relapse or progression within 2 
years after HSCT. 
o  Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) as all deaths due to GvHD, cardiac toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, 
interstitial pneumonitis, haemorrhage, hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS), skin toxicity, 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proliferative disease, renal failure, gastrointestinal toxicity, rejection/poor 
graft function, CNS toxicity, multiple organ failure, infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, 
unknown), or other HSCT-related causes until 2 years after transplant. 
o  Engraftment:   
•  Granulocyte engraftment by specifying the first of 3 consecutive days with absolute neutrophilic 
granulocyte count > 0.5 x 109/L in PB.  
• 
• 
Leukocyte engraftment by specifying the first of 3 consecutive days with total leukocyte count > 
1 x 109/L in PB.  
Platelet engraftment specifying the first of 3 consecutive days with a) platelets > 20 x 109/L and 
b) platelets > 50 x 109/L, in the absence of platelet transfusion.  
‘Consecutive days’ was defined as 3 consecutive blood samples if taken on different days. 
o  Donor-type chimerism: Complete donor-type chimerism was defined as when a donor to patient ratio of 
≥ 95% was detected.   
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 54/152 
  
  
o  GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival: time from HSCT to the incidence of acute GvHD of at 
least grade III, extensive chronic GvHD, relapse/progression, or death (whatever comes first), within 2 
years after HSCT. 
o  Chronic GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival: time from HSCT to the incidence of extensive 
chronic GvHD, relapse/progression, or death (whatever comes first), within 2 years after HSCT. 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated based on the experiment-wise one-sided type-I-error significance α = 2.5% 
under the hypothesis that treosulfan-based conditioning is equally effective to the comparator (HR = 1). The 
sample size was based on the following assumptions: 
• 
• 
The power of the trial was 80%. 
EFS-rate of 68.5% with busulfan-based conditioning  
•  Accrual rates of 10 patients per month in first six months, 15 patients per months thereafter till 24 
months after re-start of the trial 
•  A 3% drop-out rate 
•  A non-inferiority margin on the hazard ratio of 1.3 (or 7.3% on absolute scale) 
Based on these conditions at most 930 randomised patients, or 481 events, qualifying for the FAS were planned.  
Randomisation 
Randomisation in a 1:1 ratio used software SAS Version 9.4 and a permuted block technique.  
Stratification factors: 
o 
cytogenetic and/or molecular risk group for AML, or Revised International Prognostic Scoring System 
(IPSS-R) for MDS:  
•  Risk group I:  
low risk and intermediate risk AML  
very low/low/intermediate IPSS-R MDS 
•  Risk group II:   high risk AML  
high/very high IPSS-R risk MDS 
o  donor type (MUD vs. MRD) 
o 
transplantation centre 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding was performed.

Statistical methods 
Primary analysis 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of treosulfan as an alternative conditioning agent to 
busulfan with respect to EFS. The non-inferiority margin on the hazard ratio scale was pre-specified as 1.3. If 
significant non-inferiority within the Per Protocol Set (PPS) could be shown, a sequential testing was to be 
applied starting with testing the non-inferiority within the Full Analysis Set (FAS). In case of statistical 
significance, superiority within the FAS with respect to the primary endpoint was to be tested based on the 
‘Points to Consider on Switching between Superiority and Non-inferiority (CPMP/EWP/482/99)’. 
The distribution of the EFS was described using the Kaplain-Meir methods. These analyses were stratified by 
treatment arm and prognostic risk groups. For confirmatory analysis of non-inferiority of treosulfan-based 
conditioning a Cox proportional hazards regression model (stratified by centre and risk group) with donor type 
(MUD vs. MRD) and treatment as factors was applied for EFS.  
Subgroup analyses 
Exploratory data of Kaplan-Meier were summarised by means of forest plots showing EFS by donor type, risk 
group, combination of donor type and risk group, disease (AML and MDS), age group (< 50 years vs. ≥ 50 
years), HCT-CI Score (≤ 2 vs. > 2), remission status in AML (CR1 vs. > CR1), disease status at trial entry in MDS 
(untreated vs. treated), risk group within AML patients, and risk group within MDS patients. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses were also performed to confirm the robustness of the analysis of the primary efficacy 
variable (EFS) within the FAS: 
•  Cox regression model with treatment as a factor only 
•  Cox regression model with treatment as a factor and site as strata variable 
•  Cox regression with treatment as a factor and disease (AML or MDS) as factors 
• 
Inclusion of the disease (AML or MDS) as factor in the planned Cox regression model  
Secondary analyses 
For the secondary endpoints, data for the FAS and PPS were analysed.  
For the endpoints OS, TRM, GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival, and chronic GvHD-free and 
relapse/progression-free survival and the exploratory endpoints time to deterioration of Karnofsky Performance 
Score (KPS) by at least 20 points and deterioration of KPS to less than 60 points, Kaplan-Meier estimates were 
calculated. A Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by centre and risk group with donor type 
(MUD vs. MRD) and treatment as factors was fitted.  
For the endpoints relapse/progression, and NRM, the probability over time was estimated by cumulative 
incidence rates. A Fine and Gray model with donor type as factor and risk group as stratum was applied to 
compare treatment arms.  
For engraftment, the conditional cumulative incidence was estimated using conditional probability functions. 
The two-sided Pepe-Mori test was used to compare treatment arms.

EMA/903773/2019 
Page 56/152 
  
  
Potential effects of covariates on the secondary endpoints were studied through subgroup analyses. As the ones 
described for EFS but the non-inferiority and superiority tests were omitted because the trial was designed to 
test non-inferiority with respect to EFS only.  
Interim analyses 
The trial was planned as a group-sequential trial with 3 interim analyses. The first interim was to be performed 
after 45 events or 220 patients to allow for a broad review of the benefits and risks of the dose reduction of the 
treatment regimen implemented with amendment 3. Stopping early due to proof of efficacy or futility was 
unlikely due to the low information. Further interim analyses were planned after 137 and 239 events occurred, 
or after 460 and 700 patients were randomised. The final analysis was planned after 481 events or inclusion of 
930 patients at the latest. 
Analysis populations 
o  Safety Analysis Set: all randomised patients treated at least one time with trial medication.  
o  Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomised patients of the Safety Set with at least one efficacy parameter 
documented after baseline.  
o  Per Protocol Set (PPS): all patients of the FAS if they met all inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion 
criteria; correct allocation to treatment group; compliance with administration of trial medication; 
received short course MTX until Day +6 and ATG (if MUD) unless medical reasons for a deviation had 
been documented; lack of concomitant prophylactic/adjuvant DLI or cytotoxic therapy/radiotherapy 
after transplantation in the absence of relapse/disease progression. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 570 patients were randomised in Part II and a total of 476 patients subjected to statistical analysis 
(cut-off date 16 November 2016). A subsequent final analysis of all 570 randomised patients was conducted 
(cut-off date 16 March 2018).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments: 
Inclusion of patients into part II of MC-FludT.14/L started after implementation of protocol amendment 03 
(Clinical Trial Protocol V4.0, dated 20-Mar-2013). 
Two further amendments were documented including the following significant changes: 
•  Amendment No. 04 (dated 10-Jul-2015): 
o  A new PK sub-study was to be conducted due to dose reduction of treosulfan after amendment 03 
and newly available bioanalytical methods. 
•  Amendment No.05 (dated 02-Dec-2016): 
o  Clarified the DMC was to meet on a yearly basis until the last patient enrolled had been treated. 
Thereafter, no changes in trial conduct could result from DMC recommendations. The DMC was to 
meet at pre-specified time points of confirmatory efficacy analyses. 
o  The range of permissible IMP dose deviation (previously < 10%) was aligned with the exclusion 
criteria of patients from the PPS (deviation of at most ± 20%). 
o  The definition of engraftment after HSCT was amended to include that “consecutive days” was 
defined as 3 consecutive blood samples, if these were taken on different days. The second and third 
samples should have been taken on the next consecutive days whenever this was possible; 
exceptions were accepted. 
Changes in Planned Analyses 
• 
• 
Two additionally secondary endpoints were included in the analysis, GvHD-free and 
relapse/progression-free survival (GRFS) as well as chronic GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free 
survival (CRFS). They were pre-specified in the SAP prior to database lock and unblinding. 
Two exploratory endpoints were included in the analysis (time to deterioration of KPS by at least 20 
points and the time to deterioration of KPS to less than 60 points) as they are considered a clinically 
relevant description of the patient’s activity and quality of life under treatment and during follow-up. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 33.8% of patients had a major protocol deviation. Protocol deviations were slightly more common in 
the busulfan group than in the treosulfan (37.0% vs 30.4%). “Missing evaluation at baseline” was the most 
common, reported for 11.0% of patients in the busulfan group and 8.3% in treosulfan. 
Baseline data 
Demographic baseline data in FAS was balanced across arms with more male (60.7%) than female (39.3%) 
patients in the study, of mean age 59.6 (SD 6.3) years and mean body weight of 80.1 (SD 17.5) Kg. 
More patients with AML were included in the treosulfan arm than in control whilst more patients with MDS were 
included in the control than in treosulfan arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 59/152 
  
  
 
AML 
Of the 460 patients in the FAS, 293 had AML with 138 treated with busulfan and 155 with treosulfan. 
The majority of patients (93.5%) had cytogenetic marker examinations, and 39.6% had a cytogenetic marker 
detected. The frequency of individual cytogenetic markers was similar in each group, and no single marker was 
detected for more than 10% of either group.  
The majority of patients had a molecular marker examination (91.8%), and just under half of the patients 
(49.1%) had a molecular marker detected. Slightly more patients in the treosulfan group had a molecular 
marker detected (53.5%) than in the busulfan (44.2%). NPM1 and FLT3-ITD were the most common markers in 
both groups, and the only specific markers found in more than 10% of patients.

MDS 
Of the 460 patients in the FAS, 167 had MDS with 102 treated with busulfan and 65 with treosulfan. 
Most patients (78.4% total MDS patients) had de novo MDS and had a cytogenetic marker detected (58.7% total 
MDS patients). Detected markers were complex and similar for both groups. The classification of MDS disease 
was similar both treatment groups.  
However, there were more patients in the treosulfan group (vs busulfan) with untreated MDS (52.3% vs 
41.2%), dependent on RBC transfusions (64.6% vs 54.9%), very low risk (7.7% vs 1.0%) or low risk (20.0% vs 
15.7%). Correspondingly, more patients rated as intermediate risk were in the busulfan group (29.4%) than the 
treosulfan group (16.9%).

Donor type 
Overall, 75.9% of patients received a HSCT from a MUD and 24.1% from a MRD, with similar frequencies in the 
2 treatment groups. The majority of patients received HLA class I matched HSCT (86.5% total patients), and 
almost all patients received HLA class II matched HSCT (96.1% total patients). More patients with AML received 
MRD HSCTs (27.3%) than patients with MDS (18.6%). The frequency of HLA class I and II matched donors was 
similar in patients with AML and MDS, and in both treatment groups. 
Concomitant illness 
Overall, 82.6% of patients reported concomitant illnesses at baseline and data, including KPS and HCT-CI, were 
comparable for the 2 treatment groups. There were 2 noteworthy differences for MRD patients: fewer patients 
in the busulfan group (vs treosulfan) with HCT-CI score >2 (54.2% vs 69.2%), and with risk group I with a 
HCT-CI score > 2 (54.5% vs 61.6%).

A total of 16 patients were excluded from the FAS (2.4% in the busulfan group and 4.3% in the treosulfan 
group). 15/16 patients did not receive the IMP (6:9) and 1 patient in the treosulfan arm was not evaluable for 
efficacy due to not receiving transplant. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The first interim analysis was performed after 40 events had been observed. The DMC recommended to continue 
with the trial. 
The second interim analysis was performed after enrolment of 460 patients who qualified for the FAS based on 
34.1% (164) events (data cut off 19 August 2016).  
All time to event variables were calculated with date of transplant (day 0) as start date. 
EFS 
The primary endpoint, EFS within 24 months after HSCT, was reported in the PPS for busulfan versus treosulfan 
as 51.1% (95% CI: 43.4%, 58.2%) vs 63.5% (95% CI: 55.4%, 70.5%), HR 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.93), 
one-sided p-value of 0.0000424 (adjusted for strata). This result showed statistically significant non-inferiority 
of treosulfan compared to busulfan with the p value far below the one-sided significance level of 0.000149 
required for this interim analysis.  
Confirmatory testing for non-inferiority of treosulfan versus busulfan in the FAS was demonstrated, with EFS at 
24 months of 50.4% (95% CI: 42.8, 57.5) in the busulfan group, and 64.0% (95% CI: 56.0, 70.9) in the 
treosulfan, HR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.90), one sided p-value 0.0000164. 
Superiority testing of treosulfan vs busulfan gave a p-value of 0.0051268 (FAS, adjusted for strata) below the 
criteria set (nominal one-sided significance level 0.000149). 
The DMC recommended to stop recruitment in November 2016 since the primary objective of non-inferiority of 
treosulfan versus busulfan had been achieved. This final analysis with 476 patients included in this second 
interim analysis, 460 patients qualifying for the FAS, constitutes the final analysis of this trial.  A close out plan 
was implemented during which the data of subjects in the interim analysis were further cleaned. This led to 
database lock on 31 May 2017. That constitutes the final analysis and the amount of alpha spent was 
recalculated based on the updated number of 34.9% (168) of total events, per protocol. 
The study continues to follow-up patients until 1 year after transplantation of the last randomised patient, with 
a planned analysis of all 570 randomised patients in 2018.

Overall Survival 
OS (at 24 months after HSCT) was statistically significantly higher in the treosulfan group compared to busulfan 
(HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.88; adjusted p-value=0.0082). The median OS for each treatment group are not

Relapse/Progression Incidence 
There was no statistical difference for relapse/progression within 24 months after HSCT between treatments 
(p=0.5017, adjusted for donor-type as factor, and risk group as stratum using Fine and Gray model). The HR 
was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.30) in favour of treosulfan. The data for the PPS were similar.

Graft Failure 
For the FAS one patient (0.4%) in the busulfan group experienced a primary graft failure, and 7 patients (3.0%) 
in the busulfan group experienced a secondary graft failure. No patients in the treosulfan group experienced a 
primary or secondary graft failure.  
The data for the PPS were similar. 
Non-Relapse Mortality (NRM) 
At the time of analysis, 41 patients (17.1%) in the busulfan group and 23 patients (10.5%) in the treosulfan 
group had died without relapse/progression. The cumulative incidence of NRM in the busulfan group was 15.2% 
at 12 months, and 22.6% at 24 months compared to cumulative incidence of NRM 11.4% in the treosulfan group 
at 12 months that did not increase further up to 24 months. The difference between the treatment groups fell 
just short of statistical significance (p=0.0530) with HR 0.60 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.01) in favour of treosulfan. The 
data for the PPS were similar.

The Kaplan-Meier estimate of TRM at 24 months was 28.2% for the busulfan group and 12.1% for the treosulfan 
group. As for NRM, TRM in the treosulfan group did not increase between 12 months and 24 months after 
transplantation whilst in the same timeframe in the busulfan treatment group, TRM increased from 18.3% to 
28.2%. The difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant in favour of treosulfan 
(p=0.0201), HR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.91).

but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p=0.2341, adjusted for strata). The HR was 
0.69 (95% CI: 0.38, 1.27) in favour of treosulfan.  
More patients died in the busulfan group (15 patients, 6.3%) than the treosulfan (4 patients, 1.8%) due to other 
causes than infection. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of non-infection TRM at 24 months was 10.5% (95% CI: 
6.3%, 17.3%) for the busulfan treatment group, and 2.6% (95% CI: 0.9%, 6.8%) for the treosulfan group and

Final analysis 
The final clinical study report dated 18-Jul-2018 (cut off 16 March 2018) has been subsequently submitted and 
covers the final analysis of all 570 randomised adult patients including the post-surveillance follow-up. The 
results have confirmed the previously submitted efficacy data (2nd interim analysis based on 476 patients) of 
the TREO/FLU conditioning regimen. In the final analysis of primary endpoint EFS, hazard ratio and P values 
even slightly improved in favour of the TREO arm when compared to the confirmative analysis based on 476 
patients (Table 6). Comparable results were obtained for the Full Analysis Set; HR 0.64 (95% CI 0.49, 0.84).

In addition: 
• 
• 
Transplantation-related mortality (TRM) was statistically significantly lower in the treosulfan treatment 
group compared to the busulfan (HR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.82; adjusted p=0.0043). 
TRM with infections as cause of death was statistically significantly lower in the treosulfan treatment group 
than busulfan (HR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97; adjusted p=0.0371). This was also the case for causes of death 
other than infections (HR 0.42, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.97; adjusted p=0.0423). 
•  Reconstitution of granulopoiesis and leukopoiesis 28 days after HSCT was similar in the treatment groups. 
A significant difference in favour of busulfan was observed for the reconstitution of thrombopoiesis 
(p=0.0036). The median duration of neutropenia was statistically significantly longer in the treosulfan

treatment group than the busulfan (14.0 days compared to 12.0 days, p <0.0001). Similar results were 
seen for leukopenia (14.0 days compared to 13.0 days, p=0.0007). 
• 
Incidence of complete donor-type chimerism was statistically significantly higher in the treosulfan treatment 
group compared to busulfan at both Day +28 and Day +100 (Day +28, 93.2% compared to 83.3% 
[adjusted p <0.001]; Day +100, 86.1% compared to 80.2% [adjusted p=0.0381]). 
•  GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival was statistically significantly higher in the treosulfan 
treatment group than the busulfan (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.92; adjusted p=0.0087). 
•  Chronic GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival was also statistically significantly higher in the 
treosulfan treatment group (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.88; adjusted p=0.0030). 
• 
• 
In the post-surveillance evaluation, follow-up data for EFS, OS, relapse/progression, and NRM were 
obtained for a period of up to 4 years after transplantation. The analysis of these data showed a continued 
clinically relevant long-term advantage of treosulfan compared to busulfan for these clinically meaningful 
endpoints. 
For all secondary endpoints the results for the PPS were very similar to those from the FAS reported above 
since only 14 patients from the FAS were excluded from the PPS.  
Ancillary analyses 
Rationale to allow extrapolation of the data from study FluT.14/L Trial II to an indication in adults 
with a non-malignant disease  
Patients with serious non-malignant diseases (NMD) requiring alloHSCT usually receive the transplant during 
childhood/adolescence (up to the age of 18 years). However, a limited number of NMD patients are also treated 
with alloHSCT beyond the age of 18. Main indications for an alloHSCT in adult NMD patients are severe aplastic 
anaemia (SAA), haemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease [SCD], thalassaemia major [TM]) and Fanconi’s 
anaemia [FA]). The largest study on alloHSCT in NMD patients found in the literature included 489 patients with 
various diseases. Age ranged from 1.5 to 51 years in 273 patients with SAA, 1.1 to 23 years in 152 patients with 
TM, and 6 to 26 years in 31 patients with FA [Mahmoud HK et al; Adv Res. 2015 May;6(3):449-58.] 
Most of these patients are below the age of 30-40 years. Therefore, such young adult patients are usually 
treated within the same study protocol as paediatric patients. This is also the case with TREO-based 
conditioning. 
In a prospective multicentre trial, TREO-based conditioning followed by alloHSCT was used in 31 NMD patients. 
Age of patients ranged from 0.4 to 30.5 years (median 10.7 years). The conditioning regimen consisted of TREO 
14 g/m² given once daily IV on days −6 through −4 (total dose 42 g/m²), FLU 30 mg/m² given once daily IV on 
days −6 through −2 (total dose 150 mg/m²). This regimen is similar as used in the medac-sponsored trial in 
paediatric NMD patients (MC-FludT.16/NM). Due to a higher than anticipated incidence of acute grades III-IV 
GVHD in the first 9 patients, thymoglobulin [rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG)] was added to the regimen 
and given once daily IV on days −4 through −2 (total dose 6 mg/kg). Twenty-eight patients survived at a 
median of 26.1 (range 7-48.3) months after alloHSCT for a 2-year projected overall survival of 90%. No 
apparent difference in toxicity scores or mortality according to patient age or body surface area (BSA) was 
observed. The results demonstrate that the combination of TREO and FLU provides sufficient myeloablation to 
achieve engraftment in a broad range of NMDs without the potentially serious complications associated with 
traditional myeloablative regimens such as busulfan (BU) plus cyclophosphamide (CY). Specifically, there were 
Assessment report

Page 80/152 
  
  
no deaths within the first 100 days, and no patient developed hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), 
multi-organ failure, or fatal infections [Burroughs LM et al  2014 Dec;20(12):1996-2003.] 
AlloHSCT is the only curative treatment option for TM patients. A BU/CY-based regimen has been the standard 
myeloablative chemotherapy, but it is associated with high treatment-related toxicity, particularly in patients 
classified as high risk by the Pesaro criteria [Bertaina 20103; Choudhary 20138]. An Italian group treated 60 TM 
patients (median age 7 years; range 1-37 years) with a conditioning regimen of TREO/FLU/thiotepa. Twelve 
patients were adults. All patients received a similar conditioning regimen as used in the MC-FludT.16/NM trial, 
which included thiotepa (TT; 8 mg/kg on day -7), TREO (14 g/m²/d from days -6 to -4), and FLU (40 mg/m²/d 
for 4 consecutive days from days -6 to -3). All patients engrafted except one, who died on Day +11; the median 
time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was 20 days. Five patients (all of whom were given bone marrow cells) 
experienced secondary graft failure at a median of 9 months (range, 1.5-18) after HSCT; the cumulative 
incidence of graft failure was 9% (95% CI, 3%-19%). 4 of these 5 patients were rescued by a second allograft. 
The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV and grade III-IV acute GvHD was 14% (95% CI 6%-24%) and 7% (95% 
CI 2%- 15%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of TRM was 7% (95% CI 3%-18%). No case of hepatic 
SOS was recorded. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 4-73), the 5-year overall survival probability 
is excellent (93%; 95% CI 83%-97%). No difference in terms of outcome was observed between children and 
adults. This TREO-based conditioning regimen proved to be safe and effective for TM patients given alloHSCT. 
The authors propose this regimen as a suitable and appropriate option for minimising the risk of life-threatening 
complications in adult poor-performance status TM patients, although it is also of value for patients with good 
prognostic characteristics [Bernardo ME et al; Blood  2012 Jul 12;120(2):473-6] Retrospective comparison of results 
of alloHSCT of high-risk TM patients after conditioning of children and adults (age range 2-21 years) with 
standard BU/CY (139 patients) or TREO/FLU/TT (50 patients; TREO dose 14 g/m²/d × 3) revealed significant 
survival benefits for the TREO-based regimen. TREO/FLU/TT conditioning regimen significantly improved clinical 
outcomes of Pesaro Class III TM patients with regard to OS (87.4% vs. 63.6%; P = 0.011) and EFS (78.8% vs. 
57.3%; P = 0.041), while BU/CY induced a higher percentage of patients with complete donor chimerism. The 
survival advantage of the TREO regimen was especially observed in high risk patients (OS: 86.6% vs. 39.4%, P 
= 0.002; EFS: 77.8%% vs. 32.4%, P = 0.003) [Mathews V et al ; PLoS One. 2013 Apr 26;8(4):61637.] A 
retrospective comparison of alloHSCT with conventional (non-transplant) treatment approaches for TM in 516 
children and adults was published recently [Caocci 20176]. The analysis included 97 adult TM patients (age ≥ 16 
years) conditioned with BU/CY-based regimens (n = 81) or TREO/FLU/TT (n = 16). Outcome data between the 
two groups revealed quite comparable survival rates, while risk for aGvHD was lower after TREO-based 
conditioning (Odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.67; P = 0.004). T his finding was confirmed also in the group of 
adult patients (6.2% vs. 31%; P = 0.004) and unrelated donor HSCT (23.2% vs. 51%; P = 0.0012). Lowering 
the incidence of treatment related mortality (TRM) due to acute GvHD is an important achievement. In general, 
the favourable toxicity profile and the reduced TRM after TREO-based conditioning prior to MUD transplantation 
are highlighted by these authors. Results of this study are summarised in Table 5.

Table 5 Retrospective comparison of outcome data of adult TM patients after alloHSCT with BU/CY-based 
conditioning or TREO/FLU/TT [Caocci G et al; Am J Hematol. 2017 Dec;92 (12): 1303- 1310] 
Likewise, a number of other reports describe the successful use of TREO/FLU/TT or TREO/FLU conditioning in 
occasional adult patients suffering from various other NMDs. Such particular cases usually are included in 
published manuscripts focussing on paediatric transplant patients suffering from haemoglobinopathies, 
lymphohistiocytosis, immunodeficiencies, or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria who are conditioned with a 
TREO dosage of 42 g/m² [Markiewicz et al; Bone Marrow Transplant. 2006 Jan;37(2):231] 
In general, it is recommended to transplant children with NMD as early as possible following diagnosis, prior to 
the development of severe disease sequelae. 
These data support a treatment regimen using 14 g/m² TREO for children as well as for eligible adults with 
NMDs. 
The pivotal study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II exclusively included adult AML and MDS patients (malignant diseases 
affecting bone marrow function) who were ineligible for standard high-dose, myeloablative conditioning 
regimens. Therefore, the TREO-based regimen had to be modified (dose reduction from 14 to 10 g/m² and start 
of treatment on Day -4 instead of Day -6) to reduce the duration of the neutropenic phase in order to reduce the 
risk for TRM like serious and life threatening infections. However, the 14 g/m² TREO regimen (starting at day -6) 
was shown to be highly effective and safe in two other prospective phase II trials in adult AML (MCFludT.7/AML) 
and MDS (MC-FludT.8/MDS) patients who were considered mainly eligible for such myeloablative regimens. 
Independently of patient’s age, non-malignant diseases like TM are generally associated with a higher risk of 
graft failure or persistent mixed donor-type chimerism, especially if reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is used 
[Olsson R, et al Bone Marrow Transplant 2013l; 48(4): 537-43.] 
Therefore, intensification of conditioning by additional treatment with e.g. thiotepa is the current clinical practice 
and – for practical reasons - requires a somewhat earlier start of treatment with TREO (day -6). This together 
with the encouraging efficacy and safety data discussed above substantiate the rationale to preferential use the 
14 g/m²/d TREO-based regimen for eligible adult patients with NMD.  
PAEDIATRICS 
Efficacy in the paediatric patient population is based on the phase II MC-FludT.17/M study (malignant diseases) 
supported by comparison of data from Trial MC-FludT.17/M with historical paediatric engraftment data and adult 
trial MC-FludT.14 L, and a meta-analysis on treosulfan for conditioning in children and adolescents (Peters 
2011).

Study MC-FludT.17/M 
This is a multicentre, open-label, non-controlled, Phase II study with the objective to describe the safety and 
efficacy of treosulfan administered as part of a standardised fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen in 
children with haematological malignant diseases, which require myeloablative conditioning treatment for 
allogeneic HSCT. 
The primary goal of the study is to evaluate an alternative myeloablative but with reduced toxicity, regimen in 
children and to contribute to PK model for age dependent dose recommendations.

Treosulfan IV for 3 days on days -6 to -4 on top of pre-specified background conditioning (max 2).  
The treosulfan dose per day was as follows: 
10 g/m2 in children with≤ 0.5 m2 BSA 
12 g/m2 in children with > 0.5 and ≤ 1 m2 BSA 
14 g/m2 in children with > 1 m2 BSA

Treatment phase was 7 days including 3 days of TREO administration. Patients had an observation phase until 
at least day +100 (inclusive) of HSCT procedure and a follow-up phase of 1 year. A longer-term follow-up phase 
of at least 3 years was implemented for secondary graft failure, chronic GvHD, survival and TRM. 
Sample size 
The study was planned to enrol at least 70 evaluable patients from 1 month to less than 18 years including at 
least 30 patients aged 1 month to 10 years, 30 patients from 10 years to less than 18 years and at least 50 
patients receiving a first HSCT.

with data from study FludT.16/NM in a separate PK report as soon as data from study 16 become available. 
Statistical methods 
They were descriptive.  
For the primary endpoint freedom from transplant (treatment)-related mortality until day +100 after HSCT, the 
rate of subjects reaching day +100 after HSCT from start of conditioning treatment without previous death due

Page 84/152 
  
  
 
to transplant- or treatment-related causes was presented together with its 2-sided 90% and 95% 
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals (CIs). 
For the endpoints TRM, OS, event-free survival (EFS), GvHD-free and relapse / PFS, and chronic GvHD-free and 
relapse / PFS, Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated. 
For the endpoints relapse / progression, NRM, aGvHD, and cGvHD the probability over time was estimated by 
cumulative incidence rates. 
For engraftment, the conditional cumulative incidence was estimated using conditional probability functions. In 
order to reach more insight in the dose-effect of engraftment, the duration of neutropenia was analysed based 
on documented laboratory values and the documented dates of engraftment on an exploratory perspective. 
The rate of primary graft failure was estimated as the number of subjects with primary graft failure divided by 
the total number of subjects receiving HSCT within the 12-months Trial Period. The rate of secondary graft 
failure was estimated as the number of subjects with secondary graft failure divided by the total number of 
subjects who have engrafted after stem cell transplantation (ie alive without documented primary graft failure) 
within the 12-months trial period. 
The incidence of complete donor-type chimerism at visit Day +28, visit Day +100, and visit Month 12 were 
estimated as the number of subjects with complete chimerism divided by the total number of subjects at risk. 
Relative and absolute frequencies of subjects using rescue therapies were calculated. 
Subgroup analyses were summarised by means of Forest plots. The Forest plot for the subgroup analysis of the 
efficacy parameter (stratified by relevant subgroups disease, treosulfan dose, number of HSCT, use of Thiotepa, 
donor type, Clinical Trial Protocol [CTP]age group and International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] age group) 
included for each subgroup the associated sample size, the number of events, and the 12-months Kaplan-Meier 
estimates or in case of engraftment parameters the maximum conditional cumulative incidence reached and the 
corresponding 90% CI. The point estimate of the displayed rates or of the maximum conditional cumulative 
incidence reached was graphically presented by a filled square proportional to the sample size of the subgroup 
and a bar representing the associated 90% CI. 
Study status 
The first patient was enrolled on 21-Nov-2014 and the last patient was enrolled on 31-Aug-2016 across centres 
in Europe (Poland, Germany, UK, Italy, Czech Rep). Last patient last visit, including the 12-month follow up 
phase, is  14 September 2017. The study report is dated 12 March 2018. End of study, including the 3-year 
longer time follow-up phase, is scheduled for September 2019 with a final study report in March 2020. 
Results 
Recruitment of 70 patients was completed by September 2016. The majority of subjects were recruited in 
Poland (n= 37) followed by Germany (20), UK (10), Italy (2) and Czech Republic (1) 
As of data cut off 1 November 2017 only 7 patients had premature termination (due to death) and 63 patients 
are ongoing and alive. 
Of all subjects included in the trial, 12.9% had a major protocol deviation (9 patients). “Non-compliance” was 
the most reported subcategory for protocol deviations (5.7% of subjects), followed by “Inclusion / exclusion 
criteria violated” (2.9%), “Missing evaluations at baseline”, “Informed consent”, and “Treosulfan” treatment 
deviation (1.4% each)

Efficacy results 
Results of the study MC-FludT.17/M in paediatric patients with malignant diseases are mature and cover 12 
months follow-up of all patients. The final Clinical Study is dated 12-Mar-2018. 
The final efficacy results are similar to the interim data submitted in December 2017 (5th DMC Interim report 
dated 20-Jun-2017). Minimal changes were detected and marked in the following tables comparing the 
submitted interim data with the data from the final CSR version 1.0. 
The maximum conditional cumulative engraftment rate of 100% (90% CI 97.7, 100) is excellent and can hardly 
be improved. The primary endpoint (freedom from transplant (treatment)-related mortality, defined as death 
from any transplant(treatment)-related cause from the day of first administration of trial medication until day 
+100 after HSCT) is 98.6%. Only one patient died transplant (treatment)-related until Day 100. ). Due to the 
occurrence of only 1 event, no differential effects between subgroups could be identified.

Table 15: Additional efficacy results for trial MC-FludT.17/M Comparison of interim and final results 
According to the interim analysis a total of 6 of the 70 patients died. Causes of death were relapse/progression 
for 2 patients, transplantation related, for 1 patient and “other” for 1 patient (sepsis in remission of ALL, 116 
days after transplantation). For 2 patients two causes of death were reported (1 patient “relapse/progression” 
and “transplantation related”, 1 patient “relapse/progression” and “other”). For the final analysis documentation 
of the two patients was cleaned regarding main cause of death, resulting in 1 patient died due to transplant 
related cause and one due to “other” cause. One additional death was observed after the interim analysis 
(transplantation related). 
Comparison of engraftment data of trial MC-FludT.17M with historical data and data from the trial 
MC-FludT.14/L 
As agreed in the PIP a comparison of engraftment data from trial MC-FludT.17/M with historical paediatric data 
and with data from each of the arms of the trial in adult patients with malignant diseases comparing conditioning 
with TREO or BU (trial MC-FludT.14/L).  
For selection of historical trial data, a trial was considered relevant if the protocol matched the inclusion criteria 
(patients ≤ 18 years of age; malignant disease, alloHSCT, donor type, stem cell source, TREO- or BU-based 
conditioning) and was published rom 01-Jan-2001 to 02 May 2017. 
The comparison concerned the cumulative engraftment incidence including engraftment rate, numbers of 
patient engrafted and not engrafted, competing events and data on descriptive statistics (confidence interval 
and overall survival data, if available). 
A total of 6 trials investigating TREO [Peters 2011; Wachowiak 2011; Beier 2013, Strahm 2015; Nemecek 2016; 
Mattson 2017] and 5 publications for trials focussing on BU-based conditioning [Zahler 2016; Vicent 2002; 
Stancheva 2013; Skalska-Sadowska 2014; Matsuyama 1998] were selected.  
In trial MC-FludT.17/M, the maximum cumulative incidence of engraftment was  in the range found in historical 
trials using TREO-based conditioning (94% to 100%) and BU-based conditioning regimens (89 to 100%). 
Limited data for 1-year OS are available from the literature. With 1-year OS of 91.4% the outcome of 
MC-FludT.17/M was above the range of what has been reported in the literature for TREO-based conditioning 
regimens (82% to 85%) or for BU-based conditioning regimens (78% to 88%). 
The engraftment rate in trial MC-FludT.17/M was also within the range evaluated for trial MC-FludT.14/L (95.7% 
to 99.3%). The 1-year OS in trial MC-FludT.17/M was higher compared to FludT.14/L trial data: 68% in patients 
treated with 14 g/m²/d TREO, 75.3% in patients treated with 10 g/m²/d TREO, and 67.8% to 74.3% in patients 
treated with BU.  
It can be concluded that the engraftment results for children treated in trial MC-FludT.17/M and results of OS are 
at least comparable to published data using TREO or BU-based conditioning regimens. As expected, survival 
outcome for the paediatric patients is higher than in adult patient populations.

Summary of Efficacy for Study MC-FludT.17/M 
Title: Clinical Phase 2 trial to describe the safety and efficacy of Treosulfan-based conditioning therapy 
prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in paediatric patients with haematological 
malignancies. 
Study identifier 
MC-FludT.17/M 
Design 
Prospective, single arm, open-label, non-controlled, Phase II multicentre trial to 
assess safety and efficacy of Treosulfan as part of a standardised 
Fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen, and to contribute to a PK model.

Supportive studies 
ADULTS 
Studies FludT.7/AML & FludT.8/MDS 
These two non-controlled phase II trials were similarly designed and differed only in the treated diseases, AML 
and MDS. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TREO/FLU-conditioning in two indications (AML and 
MDS) and to include patients with increased as well as standard risk for alloHSCT with respect to toxicity. 
Both studies were multicentre across four countries (Germany, Finland, Poland, Sweden) and were conducted in 
parallel between 2004 and 2008. 
Objective 
The primary objective was evaluation of engraftment.

Patients with MUD additionally received 10 mg/kg ATG-Fresenius® IV on Days -4 to Day -2. 
Efficacy endpoints 
o  Engraftment: regeneration of granulopoiesis (> 0.5 x 109/L granulocytes in PB on 3 consecutive days) 
o  Primary failure of engraftment: granulocyte count of < 0.5 x 109/L in PB by Day +28 
o  Secondary failure of engraftment: disappearance of donor cells after initial engraftment (granulocyte 
count < 0.5 x 109/L in PB) 
o  Regeneration of leukocyte and platelet counts in the peripheral blood 
o  Donor type chimerism in BM at Days +28, +56, and +100. 
o  Disease status / relapse by means of differential blood count and BM puncture at Days +28, +56, and 
+100, thereafter every 3 months by means of clinical assessments. 
o  Relapse incidence  
o  DFS, NRM and OS: The survival status was assessed at Days +28, +56, and +100, thereafter every 3 
months during the total follow-up.  
Statistical methods 
Data were first analysed descriptively. Statistical analysis generally consisted of calculating point- and interval 
estimates for the parameters of interest. 
Time-to-event data were analysed by Kaplan-Meier methods when merely non-informative censoring occurred. 
In case of competing risks cumulative incidence and conditional probability functions were used, where 
appropriate. 
Results 
All 75 patients in AML study and 45 patients in MDS study received at least one dose of treosulfan, provided at 
least one efficacy evaluation after start of treatment and were included in the efficacy analysis.

Explorative analyses revealed that NRM in AML patients which was significantly in favour of patients in CR1 
compared to non-CR1 (7% vs. 27% by Day +720). No other significant findings were noted in both trials. 
Study MC-FludT.14/L Trial I 
This was a randomised, parallel-group, open label, multicentre, group-sequential phase III non-inferiority trial 
to evaluate efficacy and safety of treosulfan-based conditioning versus a busulfan-based RIC treatment prior to 
allogeneic HSCT in patients with AML or MDS considered ineligible to standard conditioning. 
Methods 
The study design was nearly identical to MC-FludT.14/L Trial II (refer to main study section for details). The main 
differences were the following: 
• 
• 
The primary objective/endpoint  was to compare EFS within one year after transplantation (instead of 
within 2 years after transplant as defined in Trial II) between treosulfan-based conditioning and 
busulfan-based conditioning. Events were defined as relapse of disease, graft failure, or death 
(whatever occurred first).  
Treosulfan was administered IV as 14 g/m²/day (1 x 14 g/m²/d) on Day -6 to -4 (instead of 10 
g/m²/day (1 x 10 g/m²/d) on Day -4 to -2 in Trial II) 
To stop the trial as soon as the question of non-inferiority was answered, a group-sequential approach was 
implemented with three confirmatory interim analyses and one final look. Interim analyses were to be 
performed after documentation of at least 90 events in at least 230 patients, 145 events (or latest with 345 
patients) and 190 events (or latest with 440 patients) qualifying for per protocol set. An independent safety 
monitoring committee was implemented to supervise the trial with respect to efficacy and any potentially 
relevant treatment-specific differences in TRM and serious adverse events. 
Results 
The multicentre (n of sites) study was conducted in Finland (1), France (3), Germany (9), Hungary (1), Italy (4) 
and Poland (2). 
Date of first enrolment: 24-Nov-2008   
Date of last completed: 26-Sep-2012 
At the first scheduled interim analysis, there were 279 patients enrolled and the study was amended (No 3) 
following recommendation by the DMC. Results of the first 330 patients included prior to implementation of 
Amendment No. 03 are reported below.

There were no differences between arms with regards to the incidence of relapse but TRM was higher for 
the treosulfan treatment due to higher rate of infection deaths.

PAEDIATRICS 
Meta-analysis on treosulfan-conditioning in paediatric patients with malignant and non-malignant 
diseases (Peters 2011) 
Patients below 18 years with malignant or non-malignant disease who underwent HSCT between January 2005 
and July 2010 registered in the EBMT database were eligible. To investigate a potential non-linear association 
between dose and outcome, fractional polynomials were used.  
843 pts met the inclusion criteria and 75% could be included into the analysis (533 allogeneic, 93 autologous). 
The majority were male (58.9%), with non-malignant disease (56.9%), first HSCT (81.9%) and were between 
1 and 12 years of age (57.2%). There were patients in all age groups including < 6 months (6.5%) , < 1 year 
(10.4%) and > 12 years (20.1%). 
As donor 20% had a matched sibling donor. The stem cell source was bone marrow in 44% and peripheral blood 
in 42% of patients. For alloHSCT, the median TREO dose was 42 g/m². The majority of patients received a TREO 
dose between 39 and 45 mg/m² (62%). For autologous HSCT the median TREO dose was 36 g/m². 
Outcome for Allogeneic HSCT 
Incidence of grade III/IV acute GvHD was 10% and for limited and extensive chronic GvHD was 13% and 6%, 
respectively, with no correlation with age. TREO dose had no significant impact on GvHD.  
Incidence of grade III/IV stomatitis, diarrhoea, and vomiting were 22%, 24%, and 14%, respectively (no 
correlation with TREO dose). Incidence of grade III/IV respiratory toxicity was 12%. There is a significant 
association between age and respiratory toxicity. Children below the age of one year (mainly NMDs) experienced 
more grade III/IV respiratory toxicity. Incidence of grade III/IV hyperbilirubinemia, AST increase, and 
mild/severe VOD was 10%, 25%, and 5%, respectively.  
CNS and peripheral neurological toxicity grade III/IV was 4% and 2%, respectively. There was more severe 
pulmonary toxicity in the youngest age group (> 6 months) compared to other age groups.  
Incidence of graft failure was 2%. There was no significant correlation of the rate of graft failure (within 100 
days) with age. Dose had no significant impact on the rate of graft failure in both univariate and multivariate 
analysis. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation of the time to engraftment (ANC > 0.5) with age and 
dose. 
There was a border-line significant impact of age on overall survival. The 3-year OS in children below 6 months 
of age is 75%, children between 6 month and 1 year have a 3-year OS of 84%. The 3-year OS of children 
between 1-12 years and > 12 years was 70% and 60%, respectively. This difference is mainly caused by a 
difference in disease related mortality (DRM). TRM is not significantly different in the different age groups. No

significant impact of dose on overall survival could be found in univariate or adjusted analysis. There was a 
significant impact of age on EFS and 3-year EFS decrease with increasing age. 3-year EFS in patients less than 
1 year of age, 1-12 years, and > 12 years was 75%, 62%, and 53%, respectively. This difference was mainly 
caused by a difference in the relapse incidence.  
In conclusion, TREO was shown to be highly efficient to enable engraftment without increasing the risk for 
severe acute or chronic GvHD. Considering that most children with malignancies were either heavily pre-treated 
or underwent a subsequent HSCT, the toxicity profile was surprisingly low compared to either TBI-containing 
regimen or other myeloablative combinations (e.g. busulfan, high dose cyclophosphamide, high dose 
melphalan). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Adults 
The indication in adult patients is supported by a single Phase III clinical study (FludT.14/L Trial II) and the 
overall design is considered adequate.  
The study population included the two diseases which are the most common indications in adults for alloHSCT, 
AML and MDS. Patients up to 70 years were allowed if sufficiently fit to receive a reduced intensity but still 
myeloablative conditioning reflecting current clinical practice. Although adults with other malignancies may also 
undergo allo SCT it would have implied a more heterogenous population. Non-malignant diseases are rare 
indications for alloHSCT in adults. Overall, the selected patient population is appropriate for an orphan 
indication.  
The comparator is the standard busulfan based conditioning in combination with fludarabine which is a very 
commonly used RIC and allows a clear comparison of the effect between both regimens. The choice of endpoints 
with EFS at 2 years as primary is satisfactory considering both regimens achieve very high rates of engraftment. 
All other secondary endpoints are also considered adequate.  
There is sufficient follow up for data maturity and to allow comprehensive assessment of results. The conduct of 
the study appears adequate and there are no concerns. Overall, the study design is in line with the main CHMP 
anti-cancer guideline and followed CHMP scientific advice.  
The proposed dose and the regimen schedule in combination with fludarabine, as administered in the pivotal 
study, have been justified by an earlier dose finding study (FludT.6/L) and data from the phase III FludT.14/L 
Trial I. 
Paediatrics 
The indication in paediatric patients is based on a single arm study MC-FludT.17/M (malignant diseases of 
adequate design and agreed in the PIP by PDCO. A paediatric study MC FludT.16/NM conducted in a non 
malignant setting is currently ongoing and preliminary data have been submitted. 
The dosing regimen used in the paediatrics study MC-FluT.17/M has been justified.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses

In the pivotal phase III trial, adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) and increased risk for standard conditioning therapies because of higher age (≥ 50 years) or 
comorbidities (haematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index [HCT-CI] score > 2) were randomised to 
receive a conditioning regimen with 3 × 10 g/m² treosulfan combined with fludarabine (FT10; n = 220) or a 
regimen of intravenous busulfan (total dose 6.4 mg/kg) combined with fludarabine (FB2; n = 240), followed by 
alloHSCT. 64% of patients had AML and 36% MDS. The median age of patients was 60 years (range 31–
70 years); 25% of patients were older than 65 years. 
The primary endpoint of this study was event-free survival (EFS) after 2 years. Events were defined as relapse 
of disease, graft failure or death (whatever occurred first). Non-inferiority of FT10 versus the reference FB2 was 
statistically proven Non-inferiority of TREO conditioning versus BU has been demonstrated in both analysis sets 
(PPS: p = 0.0000424; FAS:  p = 0.0000164) with respect to the primary endpoint EFS at two years. The 
corresponding HR (99.9702% CI) were 0.67 (0.37, 1.23) and 0.65 (0.36, 1.19) for the PPS and FAS 
respectively. The sensitivity analyses are supportive of the primary analysis. 
Analyses of EFS at 2 years for various pre-defined subgroups (donor type, risk group, disease, age group, 
HCT-CI score, remission status at study entry, and various combinations of these parameters) were always in 
favour of the treosulfan regimen (hazard ratio [HR] of FT10 vs. FB2 < 1), with only one exception (risk group I 
of MDS patients; HR 1.14 [95% CI 0.48, 2.63]). 
The favourable result in EFS is supported by the outcome in secondary endpoints of overall survival (HR 0.61, 
95% CI 0.42, 0.88), non-relapse mortality (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36, 1.01) and TRM (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32, 
0.91). Whilst both regimens had same engraftment success rates and relapse incidence it is clear TREO regimen 
is less toxic than BU, evident from month 12 after transplant. 
Although TREO regimen did not show superiority over BU regimen the observed favourable trend results are 
clinically meaningful. 
Overall the subgroups analysis favoured TREO over BU and there are no concerns for the few that did not as they 
included small number of patients and should be viewed with caution. For those results per disease (AML or 
MDS) it is reassuring that TREO had a more favourable outcome than BU for EFS, OS and TRM.  
These results have been confirmed in a final analysis based on 570 randomized patients which were in line or 
slightly better for TREO compared with the primary analysis based on 476 patients. 
There is limited information available on treosulfan-based conditioning (FT14 regimen ± thiotepa; see 
section 4.2) in adult patients with non-malignant disorders (NMD). The main indications for an alloHSCT with 
treosulfan conditioning in adult NMD patients are haemoglobinopathies (e.g. sickle cell disease, thalassaemia 
major [TM]), primary immune deficiency, hemophagocytic disorder, immune dysregulatory disorder and bone 
marrow failure). 
In one study, 31 NMD patients were treated with the FT14 regimen plus anti-thymocyte globulin. The age of the 
patients ranged from 0.4 to 30.5 years, and 29% had HCT-CI scores > 2. All patients engrafted, with a median 
time to neutrophil engraftment of 21 (range, 12–46) days. The two-year projected overall survival was 90%. 
Complete disease responses were observed in 28 patients (90%), as measured by clinical symptoms and 
laboratory assays (Burroughs LM et al., Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation 2014; 20(12):1996-2003). 
An Italian group treated 60 TM patients (age range 1-37 years; including 12 adults) with the FT14 plus thiotepa 
regimen. All patients engrafted except one, who died on day  +11; the median time to neutrophil and platelet 
recovery was 20 days. With a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 4-73), the 5-year overall survival

EMA/903773/2019 
Page 104/152 
  
  
probability was 93% (95% CI 83-97%). No difference in terms of outcome was observed between children and 
adults (Bernardo ME et al.; Blood 2012; 120(2):473-6). 
A retrospective comparison of treosulfan-based (n = 16) versus busulfan-based (n = 81) conditioning in adult 
patients revealed quite comparable survival rates (70.3 ± 15.1% vs. 69.3 ± 5.5%), while risk for acute GvHD 
was lower in the treosulfan group (odds ratio 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.67; P = 0.004) (Caocci G et al.; American 
Journal of Hematology 2017; 92(12):1303-1310). 
A satisfactory justification to allow extrapolation of data from study FluT.14/L Trial II  to non-malignant 
indication in adults has been presented , including the proposed dose regimen in the non-malignant setting.  
Only patients up to 70 years were included in the pivotal study. Nowadays, eligibility to undergo alloHSCT is 
based on patient’s fitness rather than age, and takes into consideration performance status, presence of 
co-morbidities and patient’s preference. Therefore, no restriction of the indication in adults is necessary and it is 
up to the physician to make that decision. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The clinical study report for the paediatric indication in non-malignant disease (study 16/NM) has not been 
submitted and there are limited data available. Most of the patients who received TREO also had TT reflecting 
current clinical practice. 
The final analysis of the paediatric study in malignant diseases (17/M)  is sufficient to support the efficacy of 
TREO based conditioning in the paediatric population with underlying malignant diseases which appears in line 
or better compared to historical paediatric data and with data from the trial in adult patients with malignant 
diseases. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, efficacy has been shown in the adult indication (malignant and non-malignant diseases) and in 
the paediatric indication of malignant diseases.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In total, 564 adults and 88 paediatric patients have been treated with TREO- based conditioning. Across seven 
clinical trials (5 in adults and 2 in paediatrics) data on AE were recorded. Laboratory changes of blood count 
parameters within 28 days after transplant were not considered as AEs. 
Patient exposure 
All patients in the clinical program who received at least one dose of treatment are included in the safety 
analysis.  
Adults 
In total, 221 adult patients have been treated with the proposed TREO 10 g/m²/d IV, Day -4 to-2 given together 
with fludarabine within the pivotal study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II.

Of the 88 paediatric patients treated with TREO-based conditioning, 18 patients had non-malignant diseases 
(primary immunodeficiency, haemoglobinopathy, inborn error of metabolism and bone marrow failure 
syndromes) and 70 patients had malignant diseases (AML, ALL, MDS, and JMML). The study in non-malignant 
diseases (MC-FludT.16/NM) is still ongoing. 
There is supportive safety data from a registry study of the EBMT [Peters 2011] which included 626 paediatric 
patients with malignant and non-malignant diseases who had been treated with TREO-based conditioning.

ALT/AST increased (7.2%/6.8%), infections (7.7%), fatigue (6.8%), bilirubin increased (5.9%), anorexia 
(5.9%), and headache (5.4%). 
Drug-related TEAEs (all grades) more frequently observed with BU/FLU conditioning compared to the TREO 
regimen include nervous system disorders (12.1% vs. 7.2%), eye disorders (3.8% vs. 0%), ear and labyrinth 
disorders (4.6% vs. 0.9%), gastrointestinal disorders (55.8% vs. 45.7%; especially oral mucositis 40.0% vs. 
30.3% and diarrhoea 12.1% vs. 5.0%), general disorders (20.4% vs. 13.1%; especially fever 11.7% vs. 4.5%), 
and increased γGT (11.3% vs. 5.0%). The only drug-related TEAEs (all grades) which were more frequently 
observed in the TREO group were increased transaminases (ALT: 7.2% vs. 5.4%; AST: 6.8% vs. 3.3%). 
Selected (> 5% of patients) TREO-related TEAEs by donor type in all five adult trials showed the frequency of 
most ARs was slightly higher in the MUD group, especially with respect to infections, gastrointestinal disorders, 
and increased bilirubin.

The following table gives an overall summary of AEs observed in the two paediatric trials. No striking differences 
were observed between the two arms in study MC-FludT.16/NM; however, the number of patients in each arm 
is too small to draw any conclusions.

The overall death rate after TREO-based conditioning in the five adult trials was 31.4% (177 of 564 patients) and 
the major causes included transplant-related events (14.9% in the overall population; especially infections 
[8.2%] and GvHD [5.3%]) and relapse/progression (12.8%). Median time to death after transplantation was 
5.6 months. 
The death rate could be nearly halved by changing the TREO dose regimen from 14 g/m²/d (Day 6 to -4) in 
MC-FludT.14/L Trial I to 10 g/m²/d (Day -4 to -2) in Trial II (38.7% versus 23.5%), due to a significantly 
decreased rate of TRM (18.5% vs. 10.4%) and especially infection-related death (16.1% vs. 8.6%).  
In the pivotal study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II, transplant-related death rate was lower in the TREO arm compared 
to the BU (23 patients [10.4%] versus 45 patients [18.8%] and cumulative incidence of TRM (FAS) at 24 months 
was 11.3% in the TREO arm and 28.2% in the BU.

Paediatrics 
Death rate in paediatric patients after TREO-based conditioning was much lower than in adult patients. Only 6 
of 70 patients (8.6%) included so far into the two paediatric trial died, and only two (2.9%) from 
transplant-related causes.

Adults 
Most frequent serious adverse events (SAE) observed after TREO-based conditioning in 564 adult patients 
include infections (37 patients [6.6%]; especially sepsis and lung infection), nervous system disorders (12 
[2.1%]), gastrointestinal disorders (10 [1.8%]), renal and urinary disorders (10 [1.8%]), and laboratory 
abnormalities (12 [2.1%]). 
The overall incidence of SAEs in the TREO- and BU-arms of the two active-controlled studies was comparable. 
Most frequent SAEs reported in both trials included infections. Table 45 shows the frequency of patients with SAE 
reported in the two trials MC-FludT.14/L.

Following Day +28, only those SAEs with suspected causality to the study drug had to be reported. In trial I, 
three patients of the busulfan group (infections (2 patients) and late onset VOD (1 patient) and four patients of 
the treosulfan group (infections (all patients) and CNS bleeding (1 patient) reported SAEs. For trial II there were 
3 SAEs with suspected causality reported by 2 patients in the busulfan group. 
Paediatrics 
A total of 27 of 88 paediatric patients (30.7%) experienced an SAE after TREO-based conditioning. Most 
frequent SAE was infection (19.3%). 
Since start of study MC-FludT.16/NM until data snapshot 16-May-2017, 13 SAEs experienced by ten patients 
have been reported; seven SAEs by 4 patients with TREO and six SAEs by 6 patients with BU. No SAR has been 
reported so far. 
In study MC-FludT.17/M 23 (32.9%) patients experienced an SAE. Most frequent SAE was infections.

Hyperbilirubinemia, mucositis/stomatitis, seizures, and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome 
(HSOS) 
These AE are considered significant of conditioning treatment followed by alloHSCT. 
A pooled analysis of studies MC-FludT.7/AML, 8/MDS with MC-FludT.6/L (n = 175 patients in total) revealed an 
incidence of 9.14% for hyperbilirubinemia grade III/IV (95% CI 5.32%, 14.42%) and 4.58% for 
mucositis/stomatitis grade III/IV (95% CI 1.99%, 8.81%).  
In the pivotal study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II, oral mucositis (all grades) was significantly more frequent in the BU 
arm versus TREO arm (47.1% vs. 34.8%) but the difference between arms was smaller for grade III/IV oral 
mucositis (7.5% versus 4.5%). 
Data from MC-FludT.14/L Trial I/II are shown in the following table. Incidences of hyperbilirubinaemia and 
mucositis/stomatitis were lower in Trial II. No patient treated with the reduced TREO regimen developed HSOS. 
No seizures related to treatment with TREO were seen in adult patients.

There were no events that led to a substantial intervention (premature discontinuation of study drug, dose 
reduction, or substantial additional concomitant therapy) in any of the studies. 
These significant AEs have not yet been analysed in the paediatric trials.  
Graft versus Host disease 
Adults 
The cumulative incidences of acute GvHD all grades and grade III/IV as well as chronic GvHD and extensive 
GvHD was always numerically lower with the 10 g/m² TREO dose compared to the 14 g/m² dose. 
The following tables summarise the frequency of acute and chronic GvHD observed in MC-FludT.14/L Trial I and 
II. No significant differences were observed between TREO and BU groups although it was numerically 
favourable for TREO.

Results from the two EBMT registry studies are summarised below. 
Acute GvHD 
The incidence of grade III/IV aGvHD after TREO-based conditioning was 10%. No significant correlation between 
the rate of grade III/IV aGvHD and age was found.  
TREO dose had no significant impact on aGvHD in univariate and multivariate analysis adjusted for diagnoses, 
age, number of HSCTs, remission status, donor and conditioning regimen. 
For malignant diseases, there is a borderline significant impact of age-group on the incidence of aGvHD of any 
grade as it decreases with age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 127/152 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chronic GvHD 
The incidence of limited and extended cGvHD was 13% and 6%, respectively. No significant correlation between 
the rate of cGvHD and age was found. For all alloHSCT, TREO dose had no significant impact on cGvHD in both 
univariate analysis and multivariate analysis adjusted for diagnoses, age, number of HSCTs, remission status, 
donor and conditioning regimen.  
However, there is a significant association between dose and the incidence of extended cGvHD in favour of the 
treated with higher dose. However the sample size in the lowest dose-group is small and if dose is analysed as 
continuous covariate, a non-significant decline of extensive cGvHD with dose has been observed. 
There is a significant influence of dose and cGvHD and extensive cGvHD in the subgroup of patients with 
malignant diseases. With increasing doses the cGvHD-rates decline. This is especially observed in the subgroups 
of patients > CR1 or ALL. 
Secondary malignancies 
Only one of 564 adult patients treated with TREO-based conditioning developed a secondary malignancy (breast 
cancer). Two children in trial MC-FludT.17/M developed skin papilloma after TREO-based conditioning. However, 
follow up of most patients is still not long enough to allow any comparison with published data. 
Two spontaneous case reports of secondary leukaemia/lymphoma after TREO-based conditioning in adult 
patients and five reports of secondary malignancies after TREO-based conditioning in paediatric patients (all 
primary immunodeficiency) are registered in medac’s pharmacovigilance data base. 
Laboratory findings 
Adults 
Haematology 
Recovery of blood cells (engraftment) was an efficacy parameter in all studies with TREO-based conditioning and 
is described in the efficacy section. A comparable proportion of patients of both groups in adult phase III trials 
received growth factors (GCSF, GM-CSF) between day -6 to +28. 
A summary of transfusion of erythrocytes and platelets until Day +28 allows a comparison of the degree of 
cytopaenias between treatment groups. 
In trial I, patients in the TREO group received more erythrocyte units for a significantly longer time compared to 
BU but this difference disappeared in Trial II with the reduced TREO dose. More patients in the TREO groups 
received platelet transfusions compared to BU. The number of platelet units and duration of infusions could be 
reduced with the TREO regimen in Trial II.

Clinical chemistry 
The most frequent ARs were increased bilirubin and transaminases, occurring in 18.8% (bilirubin) and 5.1% 
(ALT)/4.4% (AST) of 564 adult patients treated with TREO-based conditioning. 
Data from MC-FludT.14/L Trial I cannot be compared to Trial II, because abnormal laboratory were not 
registered as AE/AR in Trial I.   
MC-FludT.14/L Trial II 
Liver function parameters were comparable in both treatment groups at baseline. Median levels of AST and AP 
did not change very much up to Day +28. The highest increase in ALT, γGT, and bilirubin was usually seen on 
Day +6. The increase in ALT and bilirubin was more pronounced in the TREO group whereas the increase in γGT 
was more pronounced in the BU group and could be related to the high contents of the excipient 
dimethylacetamide in the intravenous BU formulation Busilvex®.

Data for electrolytes (sodium, potassium) were comparable in both treatment groups at baseline and did not 
change very much during up to Day +28. Data for serum creatinine (Cr), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, and serum glucose were comparable in both groups at baseline. Serum 
creatinine increased after Day +6, probably due to concomitant treatment with CsA. LDH increased up to Day 
+28 with no differences between both groups. CRP and procalcitonin increased significantly in both groups at 
Day -1 but rapidly normalised. Serum glucose levels increased slightly on Day -1 in both groups but rapidly 
normalised. 
Paediatrics 
An increased bilirubin/ALT/AST in 88 paediatric TREO patients was 5.7%/9.1%/ 8.0%, respectively, and 
comparable to the data seen in adults. 
Urinalysis 
No parameters in urine were determined in any of the trials. 
Vital signs 
In study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, body weight) and KPS 
were comparable in the two treatment groups at baseline.  
Vital signs did not change substantially during the trial. 
125 patients (52.1%) in the BU group and 91 patients (41.2%) in the TREO group deteriorated by at least 20 
points in the KPS. The Kaplan Meier estimate at 24 months favoured the TREO group (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.53 
0.94; P = 0.0173).  
34 patients (14.2%) in the BU group and 11 patients (5.0%) in the TREO group deteriorated to less than 60 
points in the KPS. The Kaplan Meier estimate at 24 months favoured the TREO group (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.17 
0.69; P = 0.0026)

Safety in special populations 
Age 
The data show that the TREO/FLU conditioning was equally well tolerated in patients above and below the age 
of 65 years.  
In paediatric studies the number of TREO treated patients in the lowest age group (28 days- 23 months) is too 
small (n=15) to draw any conclusions. Age-dependent treatment related AE are shown below.

No significant correlation between age and rate of grade III/IV aGVHD/extensive cGVHD or neurotoxicity was 
found. 
It appears there is a correlation between age and grade III/IV stomatitis (increases with age), and grade III/IV 
AST elevation (increases with age), and grade III/IV respiratory toxicity and HSOS (both increase in children 
below 1 year with NM disease). The data is in line with the EBMT [Peters 2011]. 
A summary of TEAE obtained from mature data in the study FludT.17/M (CSR dated 12 March 2018, cut off data

Gender 
Selected (> 5% of patients) TREO related TEAEs in all five adult trials showed higher frequency in the female 
group for gastrointestinal disorders (70.9% female vs 56.5% male). The other differences between both 
genders were of less magnitude. 
No data are available in paediatric patients.

Discontinuation due to AES 
No patient discontinued conditioning treatment due to AEs. Only one patient (TREO group of MC-FludT.14/L Trial 
II) discontinued TREO treatment after the first TREO dose due to cancellation of donor’s clearance after start of 
conditioning treatment. No transplantation took place in this patient.

Analysis by underlying disease show that for TREO group MDS patients experience more serious adverse events 
than AML patients (15.3% MDS/ 5.4% AML) but this also applies to the BU-group (10.4% MDS/ 4.8% AML)). In 
addition, MDS patients experienced more drug related infections and general disorders for both, TREO and BU 
group, compared to AML patients. It can be concluded that AML patients seem to tolerate the FT10 regimen 
slightly better than MDS patients due to differences in underlying disease. 
Adults with NM disease 
The median age of adult study patients with underlying malignant disease within the medac sponsored phase II 
– III trials (median age 45 – 61 years) treated with TREO/FLU conditioning is much higher than the age expected 
in the small group of adult patients with non-malignant diseases (NMD) requiring alloHSCT (< 40 years). Adult 
NMD patients are usually treated with the same conditioning regimen as paediatric NMD patients. Due to a 
higher risk of graft failure, myeloablative or even intensified conditioning regimens are usually used [Bertaina 
20103; Olsson 201319]. 
The two published reports on TREO-based conditioning in NMD patients which included also a few adult patients 
used a paediatric conditioning regimen with the higher TREO dose of 14 g/m²/d × 3 (FT14 regimen) [Bernardo 
20121; Burroughs 20144]. No difference in terms of outcome was observed between children and adults who 
met the eligibility criteria of the treatment protocol. No apparent difference in toxicity scores or mortality 
according to patient age or body surface area (BSA) was reported in the US study [Burroughs 20144].  
It is therefore expected that the safety data in adult NMD patients are most comparable to those observed in 
paediatric NMD patients treated with the FT14 regimen than to adult patients who are usually RIC-eligible and 
treated with FT10 accordingly. A careful benefit risk evaluation by the treating physician would be necessary 
before treatment.

Paediatric 
For the final analysis of study 17/M one additional death was observed after the interim analysis (transplantation 
related) [Table 3]. 
The frequency of paediatric patients with serious adverse events has not been changed between interim and 
final results. However, one SAE was corrected from fever to febrile neutropenia.

The trial continues to follow-up subjects until 3 years after transplantation of the last registered subject, and 
according to the applicant the longer-term follow-up data will be provided within an amended report. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data from 221 adults treated with the proposed TREO conditioning doses and regimen with a median follow up 
of 15.4 months together with safety data from 341 adults exposed to different doses of TREO is considered 
sufficient for assessment.  
AEs most frequently reported in adults with the proposed dose and regimen were gastrointestinal (oral mucositis 
(34.8%), nausea/vomiting (30.3%/19.5%), diarrhoea (14.9%), constipation (13.1%)), infections (26.2%), 
oedema limbs (20.8%), headache (15.4%), febrile neutropenia (14.9%), bone/back pain (14.5%/14%), fever 
(32.1%), hypertension (14.9%), and maculopapular rash (12.2%). Most frequently reported TREO-related AE 
included oral mucositis (30.3%), nausea (20.4%), vomiting (13.1%), ALT/AST increased (7.2%/6.8%), 
infections (7.7%), fatigue (6.8%), bilirubin increased (5.9%), anorexia (5.9%), and headache (5.4%). 
Few TEAE were reported with a significant higher frequency in TREO arm vs BU, notably cardiac disorders 
(14.9% vs 8.3%) and oedema of limbs (20.8% vs 14.6%) but no significant difference for these AE appears if 
at least grade III or if treatment-related. 
BU has a higher incidence of oral mucositis and other GI disorders compared to TREO. Whilst BU also has more 
frequent increases in GGT, TREO conditioning results in a more frequent higher elevation of transaminases and 
bilirubin. No HSOS was reported for any patient in adults receiving the proposed TREO dosage and the observed 
increase in transaminases/bilirubin are of no concern. 
The major causes of death are transplant-related events (mainly infections followed by GVHD) and 
relapse/progression. Median time to death after transplantation was 5.6 months. TRM was significantly lower in 
the TREO arm with proposed dose compared to the BU (10.4% vs 18.8%). 
Most frequent serious adverse events (SAE) after proposed TREO-based conditioning are infections (5%), 
especially sepsis and lung infection. The safety profile of TREO versus BU appears similar with regards to SAEs.  
In a retrospective analysis in a single institution, four of 117 patients (3.4%) treated with TREO/FLU 
conditioning and 14 of 210 patients (6.7%) treated with dose reduced BU/FLU developed secondary 
malignancies [Shimoni 2013].  
No relevant differences were observed between the safety results of the 2nd interim and the final analysis of 
study MC. FludT.14/L Trial II.  
It is expected that the safety of TREO based conditioning in adults with non-malignant may be more in line with 
that reported for younger adults and paediatric data with NM disease treated with the FT14 regimen. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety   
Data from the 88 paediatric patients treated with TREO based conditioning is very limited, especially for the NM 
setting (n=18). The majority of patients received a dose of 12 or 14 g/m2/day and in combination with TT 
reflecting current medical practice. No clinical study report has been submitted for the paediatric study 16/NM..  
The paediatric data showed for NM disease TREO regimen had more frequent AE grade IV and drug related AE 
but a reduced incidence of serious AE compared to BU conditioning. Overall, it appears TREO regimen has not an 
improved safety profile compared to the BU regimen. The safety profile of TREO is more unfavourable in M 
compared to NM diseases, as expected with an underlying malignant disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 142/152 
  
  
The most frequent TEAEs after TREO-based conditioning in children irrespective of disease were gastrointestinal 
disorders (> 10%: stomatitis [78.4%], vomiting [68.2%], diarrhoea [63.6%], nausea [45.5%], abdominal pain 
[34.1%], constipation [12.5%]), pyrexia (71.6%), infections (59.1%), vascular disorders (hypertension 
[35.2%], haematoma [10.2%]), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (> 10%: maculopapular rash [29.5%], 
pruritus [23.9%], pain of skin [11.4%]), headache (29.5%), cough (18.2%), pain in extremity (18.2%), sinus 
tachycardia (12.5%), hypersensitivity (12.5%), investigations (> 10%: viral test positive [15.9%], ALT 
increased [10.2%]), and infusion-related reaction (10.2%). The most frequent drug-related TEAEs include 
stomatitis (69.3%), vomiting (43.2%), diarrhoea (33.0%), nausea (30.7%), abdominal pain (15.9%), pyrexia 
(14.8%), infections (11.4%), and pruritus (11.4%). 
Mature data from the final analysis of study 17/M did not show significant differences compared to the interim 
analysis.  
Overall, the safety profile of TREO is acceptable for a paediatric indication in malignant diseases. However, 
pending the clinical report for study 16/NM the data is considered at present immature to determine the safety 
profile of TREO based conditioning in a non-malignant indication.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the proposed TREO based conditioning in adults (malignant and non-malignant disease) and 
in paediatrics with malignant disease is considered acceptable.

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indications.   
2.7.1.  Summary of the risk management plan 
The public summary of the RMP is acceptable.  
2.7.2.  Conclusion on the RMP 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact that treosulfan CAP has a completely new indication compared to previously nationally 
authorised products and it can also be used in paediatric population, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate 
entry in the EURD list for Trecondi is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for treosulfan. The 
requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex 
II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EU birth date(EBD)  to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treosulfan is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to alloHSCT in adult patients with malignant and 
non-malignant diseases, and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases. 
The aim of alloHSCT is to eradicate the underlying disease by replacing a “defective” bone marrow with a healthy 
donor’s marrow and to prolong survival. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients undergoing alloHSCT are prepared with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with 
radiotherapy, the so-called conditioning regimen, before infusion of donor’s stem cells. 
Myeloablative conditioning (with or without radiation) is associated with significant toxicity. Due to its lowered 
toxicity, non-myeloablative transplants can be appropriate for older or patients with co-morbidities that would 
otherwise exclude them from myeloablative transplantation. Fludarabine has been widely used because it is 
highly immunosuppressive, has anti-tumour activity in haematologic malignancies and a low non-haematologic 
toxicity profile. Regimens that relied on FLU or lower doses of the conditioning agents are referred to as either 
non-myeloablative (NMA) or reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). NMA regimens may result in minimal                      
cytopaenias that do not require stem cell support whereas RIC regimens do require stem cell support. There are 
several NMA and RIC regimens available, but the optimum regimen remains to be defined. A regimen of                    
busulfan (total dose ≤ 9 mg/kg) plus fludarabine is an example of RIC.  
Treosulfan conditioning regimens can provide myeloablative and anti-leukaemic activity reducing the risk of 
relapse but with a reduced toxicity. The proposed regimen of treosulfan in combination with fludarabine (and 
thiotepa), is considered a RIC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The indication in adults is based on the pivotal study MC-FludT.14/L Trial II, a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 
parallel-arm, non-inferiority, controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of treosulfan based regimen 
conditioning versus a standard busulfan based RIC prior to allogeneic HSCT in adult patients up to 70 years of 
age with AML (n=293) or MDS (n=167) considered ineligible to standard myeloablative conditioning. Treosulfan 
was administered by 2 hours IV infusion at a dose of 10g/m2 BSA on days -4, -3 and -2 in combination with 
fludarabine. 
Assessment report  
EMA/903773/2019 
Page 146/152 
  
  
The paediatrics indication is based on one open-label phase II trial, MC-FludT.17/M, supported by available data 
from an ongoing phase II trial (MC FludT.16/NM) and published paediatric data including transplant registries.  
Study MC-FluT.16/NM is a randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, study that evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of treosulfan based regimen compared to conventional dose busulfan in 38 children with non-malignant 
diseases, which require myeloablative conditioning treatment for allogeneic HSCT. The study is ongoing, and the 
study report is not available. 
Study MC-FluT.17/M is a non-controlled study to describe the safety and activity of treosulfan administered as 
part of a standardised fludarabine-containing conditioning regimen in 70 children with haematological malignant 
diseases, which require myeloablative conditioning treatment for allogeneic HSCT. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Adults 
In adults statistically significant non-inferiority of TREO versus BU for the primary endpoint of EFS within 24 
months after HSCT (PPS population 51% TREO versus 63.5% BU, HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.48, 0.93), 1-sided 
adjusted p =0.0000424) - confirmed by non-inferiority testing in FAS (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47, 0.90). A 
statistically significant improved rate of OS at 24 months (FAS population, 71.3 % TREO versus 56.4 % BU, HR 
0.61, 95% CI = 0.42, 0.88, 1-sided adjusted p = 0.0082). No patients in TREO group experienced graft failure 
compared to one patient with primary failure and 7 patients with secondary failure in BU group (FAS population). 
The incidence of non-relapse mortality at 24 months was reduced (11.4% TREO versus 22.6% BU, HR 0.60, 
95% CI 0.36, 1.01, 1-sided adjusted p = 0.05) and a statistically significant reduced transplant-related 
mortality at 24 months (12.1% TREO versus 28.2% BU, HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32, 0.91, 1-sided adjusted p = 0.02) 
was observed. In general, consistent results for subgroup analyses, for EFS, OS and TRM, including those per 
disease type (AML and MDS). Statistically significantly higher incidence of complete donor-type chimerism at 
both Day +28 and Day +100 (Day +28, 93.5% TREO vs 82.0% BU [OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.69, 6.09, adjusted 
1-sided p-value=0.008]; Day +100, 86.4% TREO vs 78.2% BU [OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11, 3.19, adjusted 1-sided 
p-value=0.0205]. There was a statistically significantly higher incidence of GvHD-free and 
relapse/progression-free survival (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.54, 0.95; 1-sided adjusted p-value=0.0224) and a 
statistically significantly higher incidence of chronic GvHD-free and relapse/progression-free survival (HR 0.69, 
95% CI 0.52, 0.92; adjusted p-value=0.0108). The results were consistent in the final analysis (data cut off 16 
March 2018). 
Paediatrics 
In Study MC-FluT.17/M the primary endpoint, freedom from transplant related mortality until day +100 post allo 
HSCT was 98.6%. No patient experienced a primary graft failure, but one patient experienced a secondary graft 
failure. The incidence of complete donor-type chimerism was 94.2% (90% CI 87.2-98.0%) at day +28 visit, 
91.3% (90% CI 83.6-96.1%) at day +100 visit and 91.2% (90% CI 82.4-96.5%) at month 12 visit. 
Transplant-related mortality at 12 months is 2.9% (90% CI 0.9 – 8.9%).  
Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression is 15.7% (90% CI 8.6-22.9%) at month +12.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Treosulfan based conditioning has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to standard RIC with busulfan in adult 
patients with malignant disease undergoing alloHSCT. The proposed regimen appears well tolerated and there 
is no indication of a detrimental safety profile compared to busulfan.  
Results in paediatric patients in the malignant setting are mature and have shown efficacy for the conditioning 
with TREO that outweighs the toxicity of the treatment. 
3.7.2.   Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects in the adult population outweigh the unfavourable effects especially in the context of the 
clinical setting of malignant diseases. The same applies to paediatric indication in malignant setting. Overall the 
Benefit Risk is positive in the adult indication (malignant and non-malignant diseases) and in the paediatric 
indication of malignant disease. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
A satisfactory justification to allow extrapolation to an indication in adults non-malignant disease has been 
presented. However extrapolation to paediatric non-malignant disease has not been possible. 
Only patients up to 70 years were included in the pivotal study and there are no data in patients > 70 years from 
supportive studies. Nowadays, eligibility to undergo alloHSCT is based on patient’s fitness rather than age, and 
takes into consideration performance status, presence of co-morbidities and patient’s preference. Therefore, no 
age restriction of the indication in adults is necessary and it is up to the physician to make that decision. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trecondi is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Trecondi is not similar to Tepadina within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Trecondi is favourable in the following indication: 
Treosulfan in combination with fludarabine is indicated as part of conditioning treatment prior to allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in adult patients with malignant and non malignant 
diseases and in paediatric patients older than one month with malignant diseases.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 6 
months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

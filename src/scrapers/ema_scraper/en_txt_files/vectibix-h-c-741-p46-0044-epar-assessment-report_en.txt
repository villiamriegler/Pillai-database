1.  Introduction 
On 22nd of September 2015, the MAH submitted a study report for a completed paediatric study for 
panitumumab, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against human EGFR that is 
indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer in combination 
with oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and as monotherapy after failure of standard 
chemotherapy.  
Marketing authorisation was granted for panitumumab 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion 
on 03/12/2007. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that ‘Study 20050252 was a phase 1, open-label, single arm, dose-ranging study to 
evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of up to 3 different dose schedules of panitumumab in 
pediatric subjects with solid tumours’. This study has been conducted as part of a post marketing 
commitment in the US. The MAH stated that this is a stand-alone study.  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, EMA granted a class waiver (EMA Decision 
P/146/2009).    
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Table 16-1.6.1 below provides details of the study medication used in study 20050252. Panitumumab 
was supplied at a concentration of 20 mg/mL in 10 cc vials.

CHMP’s comment: 
The marketed intravenous formulation was used in this study. This can be considered a suitable for this 
dose finding study.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study 20050252 (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00658658), a phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of panitumumab in children with solid tumours. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study 20050252 – A phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and 
pharmacokinetics of panitumumab in children with solid tumours  
Description 
Study 20050252 was an open-label, multicentre (7 centres; all located in the US), single arm, dose-
ranging study initiated in 2008 (first patient enrolled 14th of March 2008, last patient completed 25th of 
March 2015) investigating safety and pharmacokinetics of three different dose levels of panitumumab 
in children age 1 to <18 years with solid malignant tumours. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective according to the protocol was: ‘To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
up to 3 different dose schedules of panitumumab in pediatric subjects with solid tumors’. 
Secondary objective was: ‘To evaluate the incidence of human anti-panitumumab antibody (HAPA) 
formation and to preliminarily determine if there is evidence of antitumor activity of panitumumab in 
this patient population’. 
Study design 
This was an open-label, single arm, dose ranging study.  
Panitumumab was administered by IV infusion to 4 to 6 patients per cohort. Three planned cohorts (A 
to C) were investigated at 100% of the recommended adult dose schedules. Inclusion into the cohorts 
was stratified by age (1 to < 12 versus 12 to < 18 years) and enrolment into cohort A2 and B1 
occurred in a staggered approach ones cohort A1 demonstrated sufficient safety (see table 8-1). 
Cohort D1 and D2 were optional cohorts that were to be studied in the event that Cohort A1 or A2 did 
not demonstrate sufficient safety.

Study population /Sample size 
Main inclusion criteria were: 
  Children age 1 to < 18 years with a histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumour that 
recurred after standard therapy or for which there was no standard therapy;  
 
Paraffin-embedded tumour tissue from primary tumour or metastasis for determination of 
EGFR expression and biomarker testing;  
Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks;  
Performance status: Lansky play scale ≥ 60% for children 1 to < 12 years of age and 
Karnofsky ≥ 60% for children 12 to < 18 years of age;  
 
 
  Adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic and pulmonary function. 
Main exclusion criteria were: 
  Diagnosis of leukaemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease, or other haematological 
malignancy. 
  Any prior allogeneic transplant or prior autologous transplant less than 3 month prior to 
enrolment. 
  Requirement to receive concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy (except for 
pain control), or any other investigational drug while on study. 
According to protocol 4 to 6 patients per cohort were planned until a maximum tolerated dose was 
reached. 
Treatments 
Panitumumab was the only investigational product administered in this study. It was given at planned 
doses ranging from 2.5 mg/kg intravenously every week to 9.0 mg/kg given once every 3 weeks. 
Panitumumab was administered intravenously (IV) by an infusion pump over approximately 60 min 
min for doses ≤ 1000 mg and over approximately 90 min for doses > 1000 mg.  
Patients received panitumumab until disease progression, intolerance to study drug, withdrew of 
consent, or other reasons that warranted removal from the study.

Dose Escalation 
The decision to advance to the next dose cohort was based on observing ≤ 33% of patients 
experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in a given cohort during the DLT evaluation period.  
Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. 
Skin toxicity was evaluated using a modification of the CTCAE version 3.0 criteria.  
Hypomagnesaemia, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and skin or nail toxicities constituted DLT only if the 
following occurred: 
  Grade 3 or 4 hypomagnesaemia that persisted for at least 5 days despite maximal magnesium 
replacement 
  Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea, nausea, or vomiting that persisted for at least 5 days despite maximal 
supportive therapy 
  Grade 4 skin or nail toxicity 
All other panitumumab-related grade 3 or 4 haematologic or non-haematologic toxicity (except fatigue 
and alopecia) was considered DLT. 
If any toxicity that could be regarded as DLT occurred during the study period, the administration of 
panitumumab was discontinued for that patient.  
DLT Evaluation Period 
For Cohorts A1, A2, B1, B2, D1, and D2, the DLT evaluation period was 28 days from the initial 
administration of panitumumab. For Cohorts C1 and C2, the DLT evaluation period was 21 days from 
the initial administration of panitumumab. 
No more than 2 patients at a time were enrolled and under evaluation for DLT at the highest open dose 
cohort. 
If 3 or more patients of the initial 4 patients enrolled or of the expanded cohort of 6 patients in a given 
cohort experienced a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, then the maximum tolerated dose for that 
age group was defined as the previous cohort that was declared as safe. 
CHMP’s comment: 
This is an open label, Phase I, dose escalation study enrolling paediatric patients with solid 
malignancies. A cautious staggered approach was followed with patients younger than 12 years of age 
recruited after safety had been established in the older cohort. 
IMP handling, dose preparation, including dilution as well as method of administration followed the 
recommendations as outlined in Section 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC of panitumumab.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Safety and tolerability: Patient and cohort incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events including dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs), serious adverse events, and events requiring the discontinuation of study 
drug. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/14337/2016 
Page 6/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety: Incidence of clinically significant laboratory changes, clinically significant changes in vital signs, 
and all adverse events. 
PK parameters: Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), minimum observed concentration 
(Cmin), maximum observed concentration (Cmax), half-life (t1/2), serum clearance (CL), and volume 
of distribution (V). 
The following PK parameters during a dosing interval were estimated after the first and the third 
doses: Cmax after IV infusion; time at which Cmax occurred (tmax); Cmin; area under the serum 
concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval (AUCtau), estimated using 
the linear trapezoidal method; area under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity 
(AUCinf), estimated for the first dose as the sum of AUCtau and Cmin/λz values, where λz is the first-
order terminal rate constant estimated via linear regression; t1/2 for the terminal phase (first dose) or 
dosing interval (third dose), calculated as t1/2 = ln(2)/λz; CL, estimated as dose divided by AUCinf for 
the first dose and as dose divided by AUCtau for the third dose. 
Secondary endpoint: 
Immunogenicity: Incidence of human anti-panitumumab antibody (HAPA) formation. 
Three validated assays were used to detect the presence of antipanitumumab antibodies. Two 
screening immunoassays, an acid-dissociation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a 
Biacore-based biosensor assay, were used to detect antibodies capable of binding to panitumumab. All 
samples confirmed to be positive by drug specificity in either screening immunoassay were further 
tested for neutralizing antibodies in a cell-based EGFR phosphorylation bioassay. 
Efficacy: Tumour response.  
Tumour response was assessed by the investigator (ie no central review) using a modification of the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. 
Exploratory endpoints: 
The exploratory objectives were to investigate potential biomarkers based on assessment of blood 
cells, tumour cells, the proposed mechanism of action of panitumumab, the effect of genetic variation 
in cancer genes, and drug target genes on patient response to panitumumab. 
Statistical Methods 
A formal hypothesis was not tested in this study. However, PK parameters and safety and tolerability 
were assessed. A formal sample size or power calculation was not performed. The sample sizes were 
based on the Guideline for Clinical Evaluation of Anticancer Drugs (PAB/NDD Notification No.9 dated 
February 4, 1991; Guideline for the Clinical Evaluation of Anticancer Drugs).  
The sample size of 4 to 6 patients per cohort was considered sufficient to characterize the DLTs in 
paediatric subjects with relapsed solid tumours. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
31 patients were enrolled in the study and received panitumumab; 17 patients in the age group 12 to 
< 18 years and 14 patients in the age group 1 to < 12 years. All patients discontinued panitumumab

with the most common reason having been disease progression (13 subjects [76.5%] age 12 to < 18 
years, 9 subjects [64.3%] age 1 to < 12 years). The patient disposition is shown in Table 9-1. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics for the Safety Analysis Set are summarised in Table 9-2. 
The study included 17 boys (54.8%) and 14 girls (45.2%); most were white (74.2%). The mean (SD) 
age was 14.8 (1.8) years for the age 12 to < 18 years group and 8.1 (2.9) years for the younger age 
group of 1 to < 12 years. The most common primary tumour types were osteosarcoma (9 patients 
[29.0%]) and ependymoma (3 patients [9.7%]). The mean (SD) time since primary diagnosis for all

patients was 34.5 (33.2) months. All patients received prior anti-tumour therapy. This included prior 
surgery (27 patients [87.1%]), chemotherapy (30 patients [96.8%]), and radiotherapy (30 patients 
[96.8%]).  
All patients in the Biomarker Analysis Set (26 patients [100%]) had tumour samples that were positive 
for EGFR membrane staining. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The enrolled patient characteristics represent the typical population of children participating in an early 
phase study in paediatric oncology. 
All patients recruited were positive for EGFR membrane staining, thus this Phase I study selected an 
enriched patient population with tumour characteristics which aimed to maximise target inhibition and 
enhanced evaluation of early efficacy signals based on the compounds mechanism of action.  
Efficacy results 
A summary of the analysis of objective response and disease control are provided in Table 10-1 and 
Table 10-2, respectively.

No patient had an objective response. Stable disease was reported for 1 patient (9.1%) in the age 
group 12 to < 18 years and 3 for patients (60.0%) in the age 1 to < 12 years group. The remaining 
patients experienced disease progression. Thus, the rate of response was 0 and the rate of disease 
control was 9.1% (95% CI: 0.23, 41.28) in the age 12 to < 18 years group and 60.0% (95% CI: 
14.66, 94.73) in the age 1 to < 12 years group. 
CHMP’s comment: 
The reported objective response rate is what can be expected from a phase I trial in oncology.  
The reported rate of disease control of 60% in the younger age group of heavily pre-treated patients is 
noted and may indicate some individual benefit from treatment with panitumumab.  
PK results 
The PK analysis set comprised a total of 341 panitumumab serum concentration records from 28 
paediatric patients. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates are summarised in Table 11-1.

After IV administration, panitumumab PK were nonlinear in paediatric subjects, similar to the 
observation in adult patients (Yang et al, 2010). After the first panitumumab dose, as the dose 
increased from 2.5 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, the exposure to panitumumab (AUC) increased more than dose 
proportionally resulting in a more than 50% decrease in the mean time-average CL values for both age 
groups (see also Table 11-1). After repeated administration, the panitumumab PK profiles after the 
third dose were as expected based on the PK profiles after the first dose. A similar trend in the 
decrease of CL values was also observed, although the decrease in the CL value was smaller for the 
younger cohort. The PK parameter estimates for the 6 mg/kg cohort were similar to those reported for 
adult patients (Stephenson et al, 2009). Based on the mean AUCtau values, minimal accumulation 
after 3 doses of panitumumab at 2.5 mg/kg QW or 6 mg/kg Q2W was observed for both age groups, 
with the accumulation ratios ranging from 1.06 to 2.00. 
For the 2.5 mg/kg QW cohort, the mean PK profiles for patients aged 1 to < 12 years were similar to 
those age 12 to < 18 years after the first and the third doses.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/14337/2016 
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 6 mg/kg Q2W cohort, although a trend of lower exposure to panitumumab in children aged 1 
to < 12 years than in patients aged 12 to < 18 years was observed after the first and the third 
panitumumab doses, based on limited data, this relationship between AUCinf and age was not 
significantly different (see Figure 11-5, p-value = 0.173 for the first dose and 0.209 for the third 
dose). 
Therefore age does not appear to have significant impact on the exposure to panitumumab in the 
paediatric population. 
Because age does not appear to have an impact on the PK of panitumumab and the PK parameters 
estimated from noncompartmental analysis were sufficient to support this conclusion, compartmental 
analysis to estimate V was not performed. 
Anti-panitumumab Antibody Assays 
Of 29 patients with anti-panitumumab antibody results, 3 patients had detectable anti-panitumumab 
antibodies (10.3%), with one patient (Subject 231003003) having had pre-existing immunoreactivity 
for panitumumab.  
Two additional patients developed antipanitumumab binding antibodies after panitumumab 
administration (Subject 231001003 on day 43, and Subject 231005004 at the end of study visit).  
No post-dose antibody specimens tested positive in the in-vitro neutralizing antibody assay.

Impact of Anti-panitumumab Antibodies on Panitumumab PK 
For the 2 patients that tested positive only for binding antibodies after panitumumab treatment 
(Subjects 231001003 and 231005004), their PK profiles and PK parameter estimates were within the 
range observed for other subjects in their respective groups. 
The PK profile for the patient who tested positive for pre-existing binding and neutralizing antibodies 
(Subject 231003003) was substantially lower than those for other patients in the same cohort. The 
AUCtau values were only 8% to 12% of the mean values obtained from patients tested negative for 
neutralizing antibodies (14.9 vs. 127 μg•day/mL after the first dose and 20.3 vs. 255 μg•day/mL after 
the third dose, respectively).  
This patient was excluded from the mean concentration-time profiles and parameter descriptive 
statistics. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Paediatric PK 
In children as in adults panitumumab undergoes target mediated disposition (TMD) with non-linear PK 
once the target is saturated.  
The MAHs states that age does not appear to have significant impact on the exposure. However the 
youngest child included in the study was 2 year of age. Such a conclusion would not be justified 
without further robust supporting data.  
It remains unclear whether there is any clinically meaningful impact of bodyweight on the PK of 
panitumumab in paediatric patients. 
The MAH did not present any data on the correlation between serum panitumumab concentrations and 
bodyweight in the paediatric population. An effect of bodyweight would be expected, as confirmed in 
adult patients. Children are dosed on a mg/kg basis, hence accounting for bodyweight assuming a 
linear PK relationship. The pk relationship would usually be expected to be less than linear in younger 
smaller children.  Therefore smaller children might risk being under dosed.  
Impact of Anti-panitumumab Antibodies on Panitumumab PK 
Development of anti-panitumumab binding antibodies post dosing observed in this paediatric patient 
population did not appear to have an impact on the PK of panitumumab.

Adverse Events of Interest 
Hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, infusion reaction, acute renal failure, severe cutaneous 
adverse reaction, embolic and thrombotic events, impaired wound healing, and cardiac arrhythmias 
were identified as adverse events of interest in this study.

common serious adverse events in the age 1 to < 12 years group were dyspnea, hypoxia, and 
vomiting (2 patients each 14.3%]). 
Treatment-related Serious Adverse Events 
Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported for a total of 4 patients (12.9%) with 1 
patient (5.9%) in the age 12 to <18 years group and 3 patients (21.4%) in the age group of 1 to <12 
years (see Table 12-9).  
CHMP’s comment: 
The observed toxicities are comparable to known adult safety data. Many of these can be considered 
on target effects, such as skin toxicities, a pharmacodynamic class effect known to be related to EGFR 
inhibition.

Deaths 
Fatal events were reported for a total of 6 patients (19.4%); 4 patients (23.5%) in the age group 12 to 
<18 years and 2 patients (14.3%) in the age group 1 to <12 years. Five patients received a dose of 
2.5 mg/kg QW and 1 patient received a dose of 6.0 mg/kg Q2W. The fatal event preferred terms 
included dyspnea (2 patients [6.5%]) and hypoxia, osteosarcoma, respiratory failure, and 
rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patients each [3.2%]).  
The primary cause of death was disease progression for all 6 patients. 
CHMP’s comment: 
All fatal events were considered to be due to disease progression and not related to panitumumab.  
Dose Limiting Toxicity 
In the age 12 to < 18 years age group, all 3 cohorts (A1, B1, and C1) were enrolled. In the age 1 to < 
12 years age group, cohorts A2 and B2 were enrolled, but stopped before enrolment in cohort C2 due 
to DLTs.  
5 patients (22.7%) reported DLTs during the DLT evaluation period with 1 patient (25.0%) in cohort 
A1, 1 patient (25.0%) in cohort A2, and 3 patients (60.0%) in cohort B2.  
The patients incidence of DLTs by preferred term are provided in Table 12-6. 
CHMP’s comment: 
Dose limiting toxicities were only observed in the age group 1 to <12 years in cohort B2 (6.0 mg/kg 
Q2W). The older patient group (age 12 to < 18 years) tolerated all tested dosing schedules without 
reaching dose limiting toxicities. This is comparable to the adult dose finding results in whom no 
maximum tolerated dose was reached either.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH discusses the clinical aspects of the submission of study 20050252 as follows: 
 
 
The observed adverse events were similar to the known panitumumab safety profile for adults. 
Panitumumab exhibits nonlinear PK in pediatric subjects; as the dose increased from 2.5 
mg/kg to 6 mg/kg, the exposure to panitumumab (AUC) increased more than dose 
proportionally. After repeated administration, the panitumumab PK profiles after the third dose 
were as expected based on the PK profiles after the first dose. In general, age does not appear 
to have a significant impact on the exposure to panitumumab in this pediatric population. The 
presence of pre-existing antipanitumumab binding and neutralizing antibodies was associated 
with reduced exposure in 1 subject. 
  No objective response was observed in pediatric subjects with solid tumors enrolled in this 
study. The disease control rate (stable disease) was 9.1% in the age 12 to < 18 years group 
and 60.0% in the age 1 to < 12 years group. 
 
This application comprises of necessary documentation for submission of the completed study 
report for study 20050252 in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 (the 
‘Paediatric Regulation’). The study report is submitted as a post authorisation measure in line 
with revised guidance EMA/427505/2013 Rev.2 “Practical questions and answers to support 
the implementation of the variations guidelines in the centralized procedure”. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The Rapporteur generally agrees with the MAHs overall discussion on the clinical aspects of study 
20050252.  
The submitted data do not impact on the existing benefit:risk profile of panitumumab. The applicant 
stated that no change of the product information is required as a consequence of the submitted data. 
Further paediatric development is not planned by the MAH. 
The submitted dose finding study was initiated based on FDA requirements. The regulatory background 
discussion preceding this decision remains unclear.  
EMA has waived paediatric development for panitumumab in 2008, which was before PDCO included 
the mechanism of action of a compound and its exclusivity in relation to the adult condition only in the 
general decision process of granting class waivers. 
The current SmPC states that paediatric development for all subsets of the paediatric population for 
the condition of colorectal cancer has been waived (as per Section 5.1) and that there is no relevant 
use of panitumumab to be expected in the paediatric population in the indication treatment of 
colorectal cancer (as per Section 4.2) for which panitumumab is authorised in adults.  
The provided data essentially described paediatric pharmacokinetics and established a recommended 
Phase 2 dose. This information might be of importance for potential further development in the future. 
The rapporteur considers it important to discuss the possibility to including the available paediatric 
data in Section 5.2 of the SmPC.  
Panitumumab is licenced since 2007. However no obvious scientific discussions have been identified 
involving pantitumumab and its use to effectively target EGFR in paediatric solid tumours. This 
emphasises that panitumumab seems not to be a compound of therapeutic interest.

Although the data submitted showed a similar safety profile compared to known adult data, no dose 
recommendation can be made. 
Given the above the Rapporteur concludes that inclusion of information from this paediatric study in 
the SmPC without being linked to an approved paediatric indication bears the risk of promoting off 
label use.  
The Rapporteur is therefore of the opinion that no further regulatory action is required. 
Comments were received from one Member State who agreed with the Rapporteur’s conclusions. No 
further comments were received.  The final outcome of this procedure is therefore that no regulatory 
action is required. 
Recommendation: 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

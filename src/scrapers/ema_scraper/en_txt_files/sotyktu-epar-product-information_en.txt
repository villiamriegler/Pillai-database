CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
SOTYKTU is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 6 mg taken orally once daily. 
If a patient shows no evidence of therapeutic benefit after 24 weeks, treatment discontinuation should 
be considered. The patient's response to treatment should be evaluated on a regular basis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in elderly patients aged 65 years and older (see section 5.2). Clinical 
experience in patients ≥ 75 years is very limited and deucravacitinib should be used with caution in 
this group of patients. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment, including end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) patients on dialysis (see section 5.2).

Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Deucravacitinib 
is not recommended to be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of deucravacitinib in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years have 
not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Tablets can be taken with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be 
crushed, cut, or chewed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis, see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Infections 
Deucravacitinib may increase the risk of infections (see section 4.8). 
Treatment with deucravacitinib should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active 
infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated (see section 4.3). Caution should be 
exercised when considering the use of deucravacitinib in patients with a chronic infection or a history 
of recurrent infection. 
Patients treated with deucravacitinib should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms 
suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a clinically important infection or is not 
responding to standard therapy, the patient should be monitored carefully and deucravacitinib should 
not be given until the infection resolves. 
Pre-treatment evaluation for tuberculosis 
Prior to initiating treatment with deucravacitinib, patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) 
infection. Deucravacitinib should not be given to patients with active TB (see section 4.3). Treatment 
of latent TB should be initiated prior to administering deucravacitinib. Anti-TB therapy should be 
considered prior to initiation of deucravacitinib in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in 
whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving deucravacitinib should 
be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies, including lymphomas and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), were observed in 
clinical studies with deucravacitinib. 
It is not known whether tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibition may be associated with the adverse 
reactions of Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibition. In a large randomised active controlled study of a JAK 
inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients 50 years and older with at least one additional 
cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of malignancies, particularly lung cancer, lymphoma and 
NMSC, was observed with a JAK inhibitor compared to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Limited clinical data are available to assess the potential relationship of exposure to deucravacitinib 
and the development of malignancies. Long-term safety evaluations are ongoing. The risks and 
benefits of deucravacitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating patients. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE) 
It is not known whether TYK2 inhibition may be associated with the adverse reactions of JAK 
inhibition. In a large randomised active-controlled study of a JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years 
and older with at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of MACE, defined as 
cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke, and a dose dependent 
higher rate of venous thromboembolism including DVT and PE were observed with a JAK inhibitor 
compared to TNF inhibitors. 
An increased risk of MACE, DVT and PE was not observed in clinical trials with deucravacitinib. 
Long-term safety evaluations for deucravacitinib are ongoing. The risks and benefits of 
deucravacitinib treatment should be considered prior to initiating patients. 
Immunisations 
Prior to initiating therapy with deucravacitinib, consider completion of all age-appropriate 
immunisations according to current immunisation guidelines. Use of live vaccines in patients being 
treated with deucravacitinib should be avoided. The response to live or non-live vaccines has not been 
evaluated. 
Excipients 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Clinical studies indicate that deucravacitinib does not have clinically relevant drug interactions upon 
coadministration with the following other medicinal products and therefore no dose adjustments are 
needed. 
Effect of deucravacitinib on other medicinal products 
Deucravacitinib does not meaningfully impact plasma exposures of rosuvastatin (BCRP and OATP 
substrate), methotrexate (substrate of BCRP and renal transporters), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
(CES1 and CES2 substrate), or oral contraceptives (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol). 
Effect of other medicinal products on deucravacitinib 
Medicinal products that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes or transporters such as 
cyclosporine (dual P-gp/breast cancer resistance protein [BCRP] inhibitor), fluvoxamine (strong 
CYP 1A2 inhibitor), ritonavir (moderate CYP 1A2 inducer), diflunisal (UGT 1A9 inhibitor), 
pyrimethamine (OCT1 inhibitor), famotidine (H2 receptor antagonist) or rabeprazole (proton pump 
inhibitor) do not meaningfully affect plasma deucravacitinib exposures (see section 5.2).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data on the use of deucravacitinib in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As 
a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of deucravacitinib during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether deucravacitinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available data in animals have shown excretion of deucravacitinib in milk (see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants by breast-feeding cannot be excluded. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from deucravacitinib therapy taking 
into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of deucravacitinib on human fertility has not been evaluated. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Deucravacitinib has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reaction is upper respiratory infections (18.9%), most frequently 
nasopharyngitis. The longer-term safety profile of deucravacitinib was similar and consistent with 
previous experience. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following list of adverse reactions for deucravacitinib is from clinical trials in plaque psoriasis 
(Table 1). These reactions are presented by MedDRA System Organ Class and by frequency. 
Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections 
In POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 (see section 5.1), infections occurred in 29.1% of patients in 
the deucravacitinib group (116.0 events per 100 person-years) compared to 21.5% of patients in the 
placebo group (83.7 events per 100 person-years) during the first 16 weeks. The majority of infections 
were non-serious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of 
deucravacitinib. The incidence of serious infections in the deucravacitinib group was 0.6% (2.0 events 
per 100 person-years) and in the placebo group was 0.5% (1.6 events per 100 person-years). 
The rate of infections in the deucravacitinib group did not increase through week 52 (95.4 events per 
100 person-years). The rate of serious infections in the deucravacitinib group did not increase through 
week 52 (1.7 events per 100 person-years). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Deucravacitinib has been administered in healthy subjects as single doses up to 40 mg (>6 times the 
recommended human dose of 6 mg/day) and in multiple doses up to 24 mg/day (12 mg twice daily) for 
14 days without dose-limiting toxicity. 
In case of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of 
adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted immediately. Dialysis does not 
substantially clear deucravacitinib from systemic circulation (see section 5.2).

Mechanism of action 
Deucravacitinib selectively inhibits the TYK2 enzyme (TYK2 belongs to the JAK family). 
Deucravacitinib binds to the regulatory domain of TYK2, stabilizing an inhibitory interaction between 
the regulatory and the catalytic domains of the enzyme. This results in allosteric inhibition of receptor-
mediated activation of TYK2 and its downstream functions in cells. TYK2 mediates signalling of 
interleukin-23 (IL-23), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and type I interferons (IFN), which are naturally 
occurring cytokines involved in inflammatory and immune responses. Deucravacitinib inhibits the 
release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In patients with psoriasis, deucravacitinib reduced psoriasis associated gene expression in psoriatic 
skin including reductions in IL-23-pathway and type I IFN pathway regulated genes. Deucravacitinib 
reduced IL-17A, IL-19 and β-defensin by 47-50%, 72% and 81-84%, respectively following 16 weeks 
of once daily treatment. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of deucravacitinib were assessed in two multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo- and apremilast-controlled clinical studies (POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK 
PSO-2) in patients who were 18 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and 
were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Patients had body surface area (BSA) involvement 
of ≥ 10%, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12, and a static Physician’s Global 
Assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3 (moderate or severe) on a 5-point scale of overall disease severity. 
POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 evaluated a total of 1686 patients with 843 randomised to 
deucravacitinib 6 mg once daily, 422 to apremilast 30 mg twice daily, and 421 to placebo. 
In both studies, patients receiving placebo switched to deucravacitinib at week 16, which continued  up 
to week 52. Patients randomised to apremilast who did not achieve a PASI 50 (POETYK PSO-1)  or 
PASI 75 (POETYK PSO-2) response at week 24 switched to deucravacitinib, and continued up to 
week  52. In POETYK PSO-1 patients who were randomised to deucravacitinib continued treatment 
up to week 52. In POETYK PSO-2, deucravacitinib treated patients who achieved PASI 75 at week  24 
were re-randomised 1:1 to continue deucravacitinib (maintenance) or were switched to placebo 
(withdrawal). 
Baseline disease characteristics were consistent for the study population in both studies: the majority of 
patients were male (67%), mean age was approximately 47 years old with the majority of patients 
between 40 and 64 years of age. 10% of patients were ≥ 65 years of age. The overall  median PASI 
score was 18.7, and median BSA was 20%. Baseline sPGA score was 3 (moderate) in  79.8% of 
patients and 4 (severe) in 20.2%. Median Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score was 11. A total 
of 18.4% of study patients had a history of psoriatic arthritis. 
Across both studies, 40% of patients had received prior phototherapy, 42.4% were naive to any 
systemic therapy (including biologic and/or non-biologic treatment), 41% received prior non-biologic 
systemic treatment, and 34.8% had received prior biologic therapy (16.1% TNF, 4.9% IL-12/23, 
16.6% IL-17 and 4.4% IL-23 inhibitors). 
The co-primary endpoints in the two studies were the proportions of patients who achieved 1) at least 
a 75% improvement in PASI scores (PASI 75) from baseline and 2) a sPGA score of clear or almost 
clear (0 or 1) at week 16 versus placebo. 
In study POETYK PSO-1, PASI 75 was achieved with deucravacitinib in 58.4%, with apremilast in 
35.1% and with placebo in 12.7% of the patients at week 16. Static Physician’s Global Assessment 
(sPGA) of clear or almost clear at week 16 was achieved in 53.6%, 32.1% and 7.2% of the patients in 
the deucravacitinib, apremilast and placebo groups respectively. For these co-primary endpoints 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
superiority of deucravacitinib to placebo was demonstrated. Consistent results were seen in study 
POETYK PSO-2.

Response over time 
Deucravacitinib showed rapid onset of efficacy with maximum PASI 75 response achieved by 
week 24 (POETYK PSO-1 and PSO-2) and maintained through week 52 (POETYK PSO-1) (see 
Figure 1).

Maintenance and durability of response 
In POETYK PSO-2, to evaluate maintenance and durability of response, patients who were originally 
randomised to deucravacitinib and achieved PASI 75 response at week 24, were re-randomised to 
either continue treatment on deucravacitinib or receive placebo. For responders at week 24 who were 
re-randomised to placebo, the median time to loss of PASI 75 response was approximately 12 weeks.

Patient reported outcomes 
Significantly greater improvements in health-related quality of life as measured by Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI) and in patient reported psoriasis symptoms (itch, pain, burning, stinging, and 
skin tightness) and signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) 
as measured by the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary (PSSD) were observed in deucravacitinib-
treated patients compared to placebo at week 16 and to apremilast at week 16 and week 24. 
Improvement of these responses in patients receiving continuous deucravacitinib treatment were 
maintained through week 52 in POETYK PSO-1.

Elderly population 
Of the 1519 patients with plaque psoriasis treated with deucravacitinib in clinical studies, 152 patients 
were 65 years or older, including 21 patients who were 75 years or older (see section 4.2). No overall 
differences in exposure, safety or effectiveness were observed between older and younger patients 
who received deucravacitinib.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
SOTYKTU in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of psoriasis (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Deucravacitinib exhibited near complete oral absorption, dose-related increase in exposure, and no 
evident time-dependent pharmacokinetics. 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of tablets, deucravacitinib exhibited rapid and near complete absorption. 
The median Tmax ranged from 2 to 3 hours and absolute oral bioavailability was 99% in healthy 
volunteers. Modest accumulation (<1.4-fold at steady state) was observed following once daily dosing. 
Food 
Deucravacitinib can be administered without consideration for food or gastric pH modulators (H2 
receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors). Co-administration of food or gastric pH modulators did 
not affect total exposure (AUC[INF]) of deucravacitinib. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), is 140 L, which is greater than total body water [42 L] 
indicating extravascular distribution. Deucravacitinib is 81.6% bound to human plasma proteins, 
primarily to human serum albumin. 
Deucravacitinib distributes similarly between plasma and red blood cell components with blood-to-
plasma concentration ratio of 1.26. 
Biotransformation 
In humans, deucravacitinib is metabolised via four primary biotransformation pathways, which 
include N-demethylation at the triazole moiety by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A2 to form major 
metabolite BMT-153261, cyclopropyl carboxamide hydrolysis by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) to form 
major metabolite BMT-158170, N-glucuronidation by uridine glucuronyl transferase (UGT) to form 
BMT-334616, and mono-oxidation by CYP 2B6/2D6 at the deuterated methyl group to form M11. 
At steady state, deucravacitinib is the major circulating species constituting 49% of measured 
compound related components. Two major circulating metabolites, BMT-153261 and BMT-158170, 
were identified, both of which have half-lives comparable to the parent deucravacitinib. BMT-153261 
has comparable potency to the parent compound and BMT-158170 is not pharmacologically active. 
The circulating exposure of BMT-153261 is much lower than the parent compound and therefore, the 
predominant pharmacological activity is attributed to the parent compound deucravacitinib. 
Additionally, no unique to human metabolites and no long-lived circulatory metabolites were 
identified. 
Elimination 
Deucravacitinib is eliminated via multiple pathways, including Phase I and II metabolism, along with 
direct renal and faecal elimination. Additionally, no single enzyme contributed more than 26% of total 
clearance. Deucravacitinib is extensively metabolised, with 59% of orally administered 
[14C]-deucravacitinib dose eliminated as metabolites in urine (37% of the dose) and faeces (22% of the 
dose). Unchanged deucravacitinib in urine and faeces represented 13% and 26% of the dose, 
respectively.

The terminal elimination half-life of deucravacitinib 6 mg in healthy human adults is 10 hours, with a 
total  clearance of 15.3 L/h (CV 27%). Deucravacitinib is a substrate of efflux  transporters, 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and uptake transporter  OCT1. Due 
to high passive permeability, high oral bioavailability and low affinity for these  transporters, 
contribution of these transporters to deucravacitinib pharmacokinetics is minimal. 
Deucravacitinib is not a substrate of transporters OATP, NTCP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, or 
MATE2K. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of single doses of deucravacitinib administered as tablets was linear across 3 mg 
to 36 mg dose range. 
Interactions 
Effect of deucravacitinib on other medicinal products 
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that deucravacitinib and its major circulating metabolites, at 
clinically relevant exposures, inhibit major CYPs (1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4), UGTs 
(1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7), CES2 and drug transporters (P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BSEP, 
MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K). Additionally, deucravacitinib does not 
induce CYP 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 (see section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, deucravacitinib mean steady state exposure (Cavg,ss) 
was higher, 31% in patients aged 65-74 years [n = 87 of 1387 (6.3%)] and 53% in patients aged 
75-84 years [n = 13 of 1387 (0.94%)]. Exposures in patients aged ≥ 85 years old are not available. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Renal impairment has no clinically meaningful effect on deucravacitinib exposures (see section 4.2) 
based on a dedicated study where estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined using a 
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation. Compared to normal renal function group, 
deucravacitinib Cmax was altered by up to 15% and AUC[INF] increased by up to 48% across renal 
impairment groups (mild (eGFR: ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min), moderate (eGFR: ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min), 
severe (eGFR: < 30 mL/min), and ESRD (eGFR: < 15 mL/min)). Compared to the normal renal 
function group, BMT-153261 Cmax increased by up to 34% and AUC[INF] increased up to 84% across 
renal impairment groups. 
Dialysis does not substantially clear deucravacitinib from systemic  circulation (5.4% of dose cleared 
per dialysis). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Mild (Child-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment has no clinically 
meaningful effect on deucravacitinib exposures (see section 4.2). Compared to normal hepatic 
function group, total deucravacitinib Cmax and AUC[INF] in mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
group increased by up to 10% and 40%, respectively while the unbound deucravacitinib Cmax and 
AUC(INF) increased by up to 26% and 60%, respectively. In severe (Child-Pugh Class C) hepatic 
impaired adults, total deucravacitinib Cmax was comparable and total AUC was 43% higher relative to 
matched healthy adults. In these adults, unbound Cmax and AUC(INF) increased by 62% and 131%, 
respectively. Deucravacitinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(see section 4.2). 
The AUC(0-T) of BMT-153261 decreased by 19%, 53% and 76% in subjects with mild, moderate, and 
severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, while 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cmax of BMT-153261, decreased by 25%, 59%, and 79% in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe 
hepatic impairment, respectively. 
Gender 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, females are expected to have an 
about 30% higher deucravacitinib mean steady-state exposure (Cmax,ss and Cavg,ss) compared to male. 
Body weight 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, patients with lower body weight 
(< 60 kg) are expected to have a higher geometric mean steady-state exposure of deucravacitinib of 
37.4% (Cmaxss) and 24.8% (Cavgss). Patients with a higher body weight (> 90 kg) are expected to have a 
lower geometric mean steady-state deucravacitinib exposure of 24.8% (Cmaxss) and 19.6% (Cavgss) 
(compared to patients with body weight 60-90 kg). 
Intrinsic factors 
Race, and ethnicity did not have a clinically meaningful effect on deucravacitinib exposure. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
In the chronic toxicity study in rats, decreases in lymphocyte counts, bone marrow cellularity and 
lymphoid cellularity in tissues of the immune system were observed at exposure (AUC) at lowest-
observed-effect-level (LOEL) approximately 9 times the recommended human dose (RHD). These 
effects were not associated with clinical signs of immunosuppression (e.g., infections). Decreases in 
platelet counts and red blood cell (RBC) mass parameters were observed at exposure (AUC) at the 
LOEL approximately 42 times the RHD. In the chronic toxicity study in monkeys, clinical and 
microscopic skin changes and decreased RBC mass parameters were observed at exposure (AUC) at 
LOEL approximately 7 times the RHD. 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity 
Deucravacitinib had no effects on fertility or early embryonic development in male and female rats at 
exposures (AUC) up to approximately 247 and 171 times the RHD, respectively. 
Deucravacitinib  was  neither  embryo-lethal  nor  teratogenic  at  maternal  exposures  (AUC)  up  to 
approximately 266 times the RHD in rats or 91/20 (total/free) times the RHD in rabbits. 
In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, transiently lower pup body weights were noted 
during the pre-weaning period at maternal exposure (AUC) approximately 110 times the RHD. This 
effect fully recovered during the post-weaning period. 
Following administration of radiolabelled deucravacitinib to lactating rats, deucravacitinib and/or its 
metabolites were present in the milk with milk-to-plasma concentration  ratios of 2.7 to 30.9.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What SOTYKTU is and what it is used for 
What SOTYKTU is 
SOTYKTU contains the active substance deucravacitinib, which belongs to a group of medicines 
called tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors that help to reduce inflammation associated with psoriasis. 
What SOTYKTU is used for 
SOTYKTU is used to treat adults with moderate to severe “plaque psoriasis”, an inflammatory 
condition affecting the skin, which can cause red, scaly, thick, itchy, painful patches on your skin and 
can also affect your scalp and nails, hands, and feet. 
How SOTYKTU works 
SOTYKTU works by selectively blocking the activity of an enzyme called ‘TYK2’ (tyrosine kinase 2) 
which is involved in the process of inflammation. By reducing the activity of this enzyme, SOTYKTU 
can help to control the inflammation associated with plaque psoriasis and thereby reduce the signs 
(skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding, or flaking, redness and bleeding) and can therefore help to 
reduce symptoms such as itching, pain, burning, stinging, and skin tightness of this condition. 
SOTYKTU has also been shown to improve the quality of life in patients with psoriasis. This means 
that the impact of your condition on daily activities, relationships and other factors should be less than 
it was before. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take SOTYKTU 
Do not take SOTYKTU 
• 
if you are allergic to deucravacitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an infection, including active tuberculosis (TB) which your doctor thinks is 
important. 
• 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking SOTYKTU: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you currently have an infection that does not go away or that keeps coming back 
if you have or have ever had tuberculosis (TB) 
if you have cancer, because your doctor will have to decide if you can still be given SOTYKTU 
if you have heart problems or medical conditions that make you more likely to develop heart 
disease - it is not clear if SOTYKTU increases the risk of heart disease 
if you have had or are at risk of blood clots in the veins of your legs (deep vein thrombosis) or 
lungs (pulmonary embolism). Tell your doctor if you get a painful swollen leg, chest pain, or 
shortness of breath as these can be signs of blood clots in the veins. It is not clear if SOTYKTU 
increases the risk of blood clots 
if you have recently had or plan to have a vaccination. 
• 
• 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using SOTYKTU. 
Children and adolescents 
SOTYKTU is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been evaluated in this age group. 
Other medicines and SOTYKTU 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
• 
• 
if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines 
if you recently had or plan to have a vaccination. You should not be given certain types of 
vaccines (live vaccines) while using SOTYKTU. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. This is because it is not known how this medicine 
will affect the baby. 
Driving and using machines 
SOTYKTU is not expected to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
SOTYKTU contains lactose 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor 
before taking this medicine. 
SOTYKTU contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take SOTYKTU 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose is 6 mg taken every day. The tablet should be swallowed whole and can be 
taken either with or without food. Do not crush, cut, or chew the tablets. 
Your doctor will decide for how long you need to use SOTYKTU. 
If your condition has not improved after six months of treatment, talk to your doctor. 
If you take more SOTYKTU than you should 
If you have taken more SOTYKTU than you should, talk to your doctor as soon as possible. You may 
get some of the side effects listed in section 4. 
If you forget to take SOTYKTU 
If you forgot to take SOTYKTU, just take the normal dose the next day. Do not take a double dose to 
make up for a forgotten tablet. 
If you stop taking SOTYKTU 
Do not stop taking SOTYKTU without talking to your doctor first. If you stop treatment, symptoms of 
psoriasis may come back. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

ivabradine 
On 23 March 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Ivabradine 
Accord, intended for the treatment of chronic heart failure and symptomatic treatment of chronic stable 
angina pectoris. The applicant for this medicinal product is Accord Healthcare Ltd. 
Ivabradine Accord will be available as 5 mg and 7.5 mg film-coated tablets. The active substance of 
Ivabradine Accord is ivabradine, a heart rate lowering agent (ATC code: C01EB17) that acts by selective 
and specific inhibition of the cardiac pacemaker If current that controls the spontaneous diastolic 
depolarisation in the sinus node and regulates heart rate.  
Ivabradine Accord is a generic of Procoralan, which has been authorised in the EU since 25 October 2005. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Ivabradine Accord, and its bioequivalence to the 
reference product Procoralan. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by platelet 
destruction caused by antiplatelet autoantibodies. In adults, chronic ITP is more common in women than 
men (approximately 2:1, respectively) and rarely remits spontaneously. It is classified by duration into 
newly diagnosed, persistent (3-12 months duration) and chronic (≥ 12 months duration). ITP in adults 
typically has an insidious onset with no preceding viral or other illness and it normally follows a chronic 
course. 
In Europe, adult ITP has an incidence of 1.6 to 3.9 cases per 100,000 per year with increasing incidence 
with older age and equal for the sexes except in the mid-adult years (30-60 years), when the disease is 
more prevalent in women. Childhood ITP has an incidence of between 1.9 and 6.4 per 100,000 per year 
with equal distribution between the sexes.  
The diagnosis of ITP can  be difficult because of the variety of presentations and lack of specific criteria. 
The only consistent abnormalities are microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (with red-cell fragmentation), 
and  thrombocytopenia,  features  that  can  also  occur  in  other  conditions.  Neurologic  and  renal 
abnormalities  and  fever  can  also  occur.  The  onset  of  the  disease  is  often  insidious  because  history  and

physical  examination  are  normal  except  for  symptoms  that  accompany  platelet  disorders  (purpura, 
epistaxis, and gingival bleeding are common). In general, ITP is defined by a low platelet count, normal 
bone marrow, and the absence of other causes of thrombocytopenia.  
According to current guidelines the therapeutic goal is to avoid or defer the risks of more toxic treatments 
(eg  splenectomy  or  immunosuppression),  reduce  corticosteroid  exposure  to  minimum  levels  and  for  the 
shortest time and achieve long-lasting responses (EMA/CHMP/153191/2013, 2014). 
Splenectomy  has  been  utilized  to  treat  immune  thrombocytopenia  since  the  early  1900s  and  remained 
the ‘first-line, gold standard procedure’ until the 1950s, when steroids were introduced. Splenectomy has 
been the standard second-line treatment for adults with ITP since.  It remains the treatment option with 
the highest overall success rate, with approximately two thirds of patients remaining in clinical remission 
5-10 years after splenectomy. A systematic review of 135 case-series published between 1966 and 2004 
revealed a complete response rate of 66%, with a median duration of follow-up of 28 months (range, 1-
153 months) Kojouri et al, 2004. Also, a > 70% probability of maintaining a response after 5 years was 
found  from  follow-up  of  402  splenectomized  patients  (Vianelli,  et  al,  2005).  There  are  near-term  and 
perioperative complications (general anesthesia, bleeding and thrombosis, as well as postoperative pain, 
pneumonia  and  atelectasis,  wound/other  infection  and  ileus)  and  longer-term  complications,  Risk  of 
Infection, Vascular Complications, Mortality and Relapse.  
Even though splenectomy remains an appropriate treatment, the frequency of splenectomy as treatment 
for  ITP  in  adults  seems  to  be  decreasing.  Older  cohorts  described  in  the  literature  describe  the 
splenectomy rate at 50 to 60% or higher, and in more recent studies it is around 20 to 25% (Rodeghiero 
and  Ruggeri,  2008).  The  most  recent  guidelines  of  ITP  (Provan  et  al,  2010;  Neunert  et  al,  2011)  have 
both recommended splenectomy as a second-line therapy and agree that splenectomy should be delayed 
at  least  6  to  12  months  (Provan  et  al,  2010;  Neunert  et  al,  2011).  However,  there  is  no  consensus 
regarding the best sequence of treatments and therapy should be individualized.  
Eltrombopag  is  an  orally  bioavailable,  small-molecule  thrombopoietin  (TPO)-receptor  agonist  that 
interacts  with  the  transmembrane  domain  of  the  human  TPO-receptor  and  initiates  signaling  cascades 
that induce proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitor cells. 
Revolade (eltrombopag) was issued a MA in the EU in March 2010, for the treatment of adult chronic ITP 
splenectomised  patients  who  are  refractory  to  other  treatments  (e.g.  corticosteroids,  immunoglobulins), 
and  as  a  second  line treatment  for  adult  non-splenectomised  patients  where  surgery  is  contraindicated. 
During  the  initial  evaluation  it  was  demonstrated  that  eltrombopag  increases  platelet  count  in  patients 
with chronic ITP unresponsive to at least one first line therapy (corticosteroids or immunoglobulins). This 
effect has been shown to be superior to placebo in both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients 
in  two  well-designed  and  conducted  placebo-controlled  clinical  trials  of  short-term  (6  weeks)  and 
medium-term  (6  months)  duration.  Efficacy  was  demonstrated  in  both  splenectomized  and  non-
splenectomized  patients,  however  considering  the  long  term  safety  uncertainties,  its  use  in  non 
splenectomized  patients  was  restricted  to  those  in  whom  the  surgery  was  contraindicated.  At  that  time 
the  splenectomy  was  a  definitive  curative  treatment  considered  as  gold  standard  within  the  second  line 
alternatives to patients failed to corticosteroids and immunoglobulins. 
Currently,  eltrombopag  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP  in  over  90  countries  worldwide 
including the U.S., Australia, Switzerland and Japan. The MA in the EU has been renewed with unlimited 
validity. 
The MAH on the basis of cumulative evidence proposes to revise the currently approved EU Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) indication to remove the phrase “where surgery is contra-indicated”.  
The proposed therapeutic indication is: 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 6/37 
 
  
  
"Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who 
had an insufficient response to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins or splenectomy). 
The indication approved by the CHMP was: 
"Revolade is indicated for adult chronic immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients who 
are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). 
The posology in non-splenectomised ITP patients is the same as in splenectomised and as currently 
established in the section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA which will address all indications for eltrombopag (tablets and PfOS) is due by April 
2016. Reports from the completed aquatic and terrestrial fate and effects studies will be included. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
This variation presents a summary of the clinical efficacy data that were part of the original submission in 
splenectomised and non-splenectomised adult chronic ITP patients in support of the request to modify the 
indication statement. 
In addition, a supportive summary of relevant clinical efficacy data obtained since the original submission 
date from the paediatric chronic ITP development program is presented, as these studies were conducted 
in  primarily  non-splenectomised patients.  Note,  a  line  extension  application  is  ongoing  in parallel to  this 
application, in the paediatric ITP population. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
In support of the Marketing Authorisation Application, 1 dose finding randomised placebo controlled 
study, 2 phase III randomised placebo controlled studies (one short-term and one long-term) and 2 open 
label studies were conducted.  
All randomised studies included ITP patients with a variable degree of previous exposure to available 
therapies (failing at least one previous therapy). Both splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients 
were included in all trials.

In TRA100773A, a dose-dependent increase in response was observed, and the primary endpoint of the 
study (shift from baseline platelets <30 Gi/L to platelets ≥50 Gi/L) was achieved by 11% of subjects on 
placebo,  compared  to  28%,  70%,  and  81%  of  subjects  on  eltrombopag  30  mg,  50  mg,  and  75  mg, 
respectively. The odds of treatment response compared to placebo were statistically significant in the 50 
mg and 75 mg groups of TRA100773A (p<0.001). 
Baseline  median  platelet  counts  were  similar  across  all  4  treatment  groups  and  a  dose  dependent 
increase in the median platelet count was observed at each visit, confirming the dose dependent increase 
in responders. This response to eltrombopag relative to placebo was observed regardless of splenectomy 
status and no significant interaction between response and splenectomy status was observed.

Paediatric chronic ITP Studies 
PETIT  (Study  TRA108062)  was  a  Phase  II,  three-part,  staggered  cohort,  open-label  and  double-blind, 
randomised, placebo-controlled study to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics 
of  eltrombopag  in  previously  treated  paediatric  patients  with  chronic  ITP.  Fifteen  subjects,  5  per  age 
cohort,  were  enrolled  in  the  PETIT  Dose  Finding  Phase.  These  subjects  did  not  participate  in  the 
Randomized Period. Eligibility criteria were similar to PETIT2, except that subjects in PETIT were required 
to have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic ITP for at least 6 months. 
Subjects  received  7  weeks  of  double-blinded  study  medication,  and  up  to  24  weeks  of  open-label 
eltrombopag. 
A  total  of  67  subjects  were  randomized  (45  eltrombopag;  22  placebo)  and  65  subjects  entered  the 
Eltrombopag-Only  Period.  The  majority  of  subjects  received  at  least  2  prior  ITP  therapies  (84.4% 
eltrombopag  and  86.4%  placebo).  Baseline  disease  characteristics  were  similar  between  the  treatment 
groups  and  consistent  with  a  paediatric  chronic  ITP  population.  The  majority  of  subjects  (77/82,  94%) 
were not splenectomised at baseline; five subjects had been splenectomised prior to study entry. 
In  PETIT,  analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  demonstrated that  eltrombopag  subjects  were  more  likely  to 
have a platelet response in the absence of rescue treatment at least once over the 6-week Randomised 
Period compared with placebo subjects (62.2% versus 31.8%; p=0.011). 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Two Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, RAISE (TRA102537) and 
TRA100773B, and two open-label studies, REPEAT (TRA108057) and EXTEND (TRA105325), evaluated 
the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in adult patients with previously treated chronic ITP as part of the 
original MAA submission for Revolade. Overall, eltrombopag was administered to 277 ITP patients for at 
least 6 months and 202 patients for at least 1 year (see Table 1). 
EXTEND, one of the long-term studies of eltrombopag in patients with chronic ITP, was designed primarily 
to assess the safety of eltrombopag over long-term dosing and to allow access to eltrombopag for 
subjects who participated in prior eltrombopag studies (including TRA100773A, TRA100773B, 
TRA108057/REPEAT and TRA102537/RAISE). EXTEND is continuing and, according to the most recent 
PSUR for eltrombopag, the final study report is due in 2015.  
In addition, there are a number of ongoing studies collecting data on the safety and utilisation of 
Revolade.  
TRA112940 is a longitudinal 2-year bone marrow study of eltrombopag olamine (SB-497115-GR) in 
previously-treated adults, with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The primary objective 
to assess the levels of bone marrow fibers (reticulin and/or collagen) at baseline and any change from 
baseline after 1 and 2 years of treatment with eltrombopag in adult subjects with chronic ITP. This is due

by September 2015 as a follow up measure from the original authorisation and is not presented in this 
application. 
WEUKBRE7133, a drug utilisation study, is ongoing with the final study report planned in 2016. 
Adult chronic ITP Studies 
StudiesTRA100773B  and  RAISE  (TRA102537)  were  global,  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical trials, and TRA100773A was a randomised, double-blind phase 2 study. In the 
3 double-blind studies, eligible subjects had platelet counts at baseline of <30 Gi/L. In TRA100773A and 
TRA100773B, treatment was administered once daily for up to 6 weeks, whereas in RAISE treatment was 
administered for up to 6 months. In all 3 studies, randomization was stratified based upon use or non-use 
of  ITP  medications  at  randomization,  splenectomy  status  and  baseline  platelet  count  (≤15  Gi/L  or  >15 
Gi/L). 
Paediatric chronic ITP Studies 
PETIT2 (Study TRA115450) was a Phase III, two-part, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled and 
open-label study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of eltrombopag in paediatric patients 
with  previously  treated  chronic  ITP,  with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  chronic  ITP  for  at  least  1  year.  The 
study  enrolled  subjects  between  1  year  and  <18  years  of  age,  and  a  platelet  count  at  baseline  of  <30 
Gi/L. 
Subjects  were  refractory  or  relapsed  after  at  least  one  prior  ITP  therapy,  or  not  eligible,  for  a  medical 
reason,  to  continue  other  ITP  treatments.  Subjects  received  13  weeks  of  double-blinded  study 
medication, and 24 weeks of open-label eltrombopag. 
TRA102537/RAISE 
Methods  
RAISE was a second, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase III study to assess the efficacy 
during 6 month dosing of eltrombobag 50 mg once daily in the treatment of 197 adults with ITP (for 
detailed assessment please refer to CHMP AR or published EPAR for the original MAA.

Treatments 
Throughout the 6-month treatment period, the dose of the study medication could be up- (75 mg/d) or 
down- (25 mg/d) titrated according to platelet count monitoring. Subjects were allowed a dose increase 
on or after day 22 if the platelet count did not rise above 50 Gi/L for two successive platelet count 
assessments. The subjects reduced their dose of study drug when the platelet count exceeded 200 Gi/L. 
When the platelet count reached 400 Gi/L, study medication was interrupted for at least 7 days and until 
platelet counts fell below 150 Gi/L, at which point subjects were re-commenced at the next lower dose.  
After completion of the 6 month dosing period, patients were followed up at weeks 1, 2, and 4 and 
months 3 and 6. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the odds of achieving a platelet count > 50 and < 400 Gi/L for a subject 
receiving eltrombopag relative to placebo during the 6-month treatment period. Other secondary 
endpoints proposed in this clinical trial were the overall platelet response, duration of the platelet 
response, the proportion of patients requiring rescue medication or reducing concomitant ITP medication, 
and changes in the WHO bleeding and ITP  scores.  
A subject was classified as a negative response from the time they began taking any form of rescue 
treatment, for the duration of rescue treatment use, and until the platelet count fell below 50 Gi/L. After 
this, any subsequent assessments in the appropriate range were counted as a positive response if the 
platelet count was ≥50 and ≤400Gi/L. Restarting a concomitant medication that had been stopped during 
the trial was not classified as rescue medication, provided it was at the same or a lower dose. A higher 
dose counted as rescue medication. 
Sample size 
The primary analysis was to compare the odds of achieving a platelet count ≥50 and ≤400,000/μL during 
the  treatment  period  in  the  eltrombopag  group  relative  to  the  placebo  group.  Assuming  60%  and  25% 
positive response rates in the eltrombopag and placebo groups, respectively, 120 evaluable subjects were 
needed to provide ≥90% power at the 1% (two-sided) level of significance. To ensure sufficient power for 
both  the  primary  and  main  secondary  endpoints,  a  30%  increase  in  subjects  was  pre-specified  to 
compensate for potential missing data and drop-outs during the full 6 month study duration for a total of 
189 subjects (63 placebo subjects; 126 eltrombopag subjects).

Randomisation 
Patients were randomised on a 2:1 ratio to receive eltrombopag 50 mg/d (135 subjects) or placebo (62 
subjects). The randomisation scheme was stratified by splenectomy (yes/no), use of ITP medication at 
randomization (yes/no), and baseline platelet count ≤15 Gi/L (yes/no). 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  double-blinded.  Treatments  were  blinded  to  the  research  subjects  and  all  study  and 
sponsor personnel. Treatment blind was maintained by use of matching placebo medication. 
Statistical methods 
Response  profiles  were  compared  using  a  repeated  measures  model  for  binary  data  adjusted  for  the 
randomization  stratification  variables.  Generalized  estimating  equations  (GEE)  methodology  was  used to 
estimate the regression model parameters with the correlation of an individual subject’s responder status 
between  visits  being  modelled  as  exchangeable  (i.e.  assuming  the  correlation  between  any  2  measures 
for  a  subject  is  the  same).  Significance  testing  was  two-sided  at  the  1%  level  of  significance  for  the 
primary  endpoint,  and  unless  stated  otherwise,  significance  testing  was  two-sided  at  the  5%  level  of 
significance for all other comparisons. Unless otherwise stated, 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the 
odds  ratios  or  treatment  differences,  as  appropriate,  were  presented.  There  were  no  requirements  for 
multiplicity adjustments in this study. The overall Type I error rate was 0.01 (two-sided) for the primary 
efficacy  analysis  and,  unless  otherwise  indicated,  0.05  (two-sided)  for  all  secondary  and  exploratory 
analyses. 
Populations for the main analysis were the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized subjects), the 
per-protocol  (PP)  population  (ITT  excluding  major  protocol  violators),  and  the  safety  population  was 
comprised of all randomized subjects who had received at least one dose of the study treatment.  
Results 
One  hundred  and  ninety-seven  subjects  were  randomized  to  receive  either  placebo  (n=62)  or 
eltrombopag 50 mg (n=135) for up to 6 months. Subjects in the placebo and eltrombopag groups had a 
median  age  of  52.5  and  47  years,  respectively,  and  69%  of  subjects  in  both  groups  were  female.  All 
subjects in both treatment groups had at least 1 prior ITP therapy (including splenectomy). 
Most patients (placebo 42 [68%]; eltrombopag 95 [70%]) were of white/Caucasian /European heritage. 
All subjects in both treatment groups had ≥1 prior ITP therapy (including splenectomy). Eighty-one 
percent of placebo-treated subjects and 78% of eltrombopag-treated subjects had received at least 2 
prior therapies, and more than 30% of subjects in each group had received ≥4 prior therapies.

The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  achieved,  demonstrating  the  effectiveness  of  eltrombopag  in 
comparison  to  placebo  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP.  The  odds  of  achieving  a  platelet  response 
between  50  Gi/L  and  400  Gi/L  were  8  times  greater  in  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  throughout  the  6-
month  treatment  period  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects,  providing  strong  evidence  of  the  long-
term  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  compared  to  placebo  (Odds  Ratio  [99%  confidence  interval]  =  8.2  [3.59, 
18.73],  p<0.0001).  This  response  to  eltrombopag  relative  to  placebo  was  observed  regardless  of 
splenectomy status, baseline platelet count, and use of baseline ITP medications. 
Median  platelet  counts  for  eltrombopag-treated  subjects  began  to  rise  after  1  week  of  treatment  and 
remained above 50 Gi/L throughout the 6 month treatment period. In contrast, median platelet counts for 
subjects  treated  with  placebo  did  not  rise  above  30  Gi/L  throughout  the  study.  Two  weeks  after 
discontinuation of eltrombopag, median platelet counts had returned to near baseline levels. 
Significantly more subjects in the eltrombopag group (33%) maintained platelet counts between 50 and 
400  Gi/L  for  ≥75%  of  on-treatment  assessments  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (3%).  No  significant 
interaction  between  response  to  eltrombopag  and  splenectomy  status  was  observed.Eltrombopag 
treatment  allowed  significantly  more  subjects  to  reduce  or  discontinue  baseline  ITP  therapies 
(predominantly corticosteroids) compared to placebo treatment (59% vs. 32%; p=0.02). 
Additionally, significantly fewer eltrombopag-treated subjects required protocol-defined rescue treatment 
(new  ITP  medication,  increased  dose  of  a  baseline  ITP  medication,  platelet  transfusion,  and/or 
splenectomy) compared to placebo-treated subjects (18% vs. 40%, p=0.001). No significant interaction 
between  requirement  for  rescue  treatment  and  splenectomy  status  was  observed  the  need  for  rescue 
treatment was not influenced by splenectomy status. 
TRA100773B 
TRA100773B confirmed the predictability of response to eltrombopag observed in TRA100773A, with 16% 
of subjects on placebo compared to 59% of subjects on eltrombopag achieving platelet counts ≥50 Gi/L 
(p<0.001). This effect of eltrombopag relative to placebo was significant across all subgroups regardless 
of baseline platelet count, use of concomitant ITP medication, or splenectomy status.

EXTEND Study 
The  baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  for  the  splenectomised  and  nonsplenectomised 
subjects are presented in the following tables 
The  efficacy  of  eltrombopag  in  the  EXTEND  study,  as  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  of  06  April  2015,  is 
described below for splenectomised and non-splenectomised subjects. 
A  similar  proportion  of  subjects  in  each  subgroup  achieved  platelet  counts  ≥  50  Gi/L  at  any  time  post-
baseline  and  in  the  absence  of  rescue  medication  (Table  2-5).  More  nonsplenectomised  subjects 
maintained a response for >50% and >75% of assessments than the splenectomised subjects (Table 2-
6).

N/A 
Clinical studies in special populations 
-  Paediatric Chronic ITP 
TRA115450/PETIT2 
A total of 92 subjects were randomized in the PETIT2 study (63 to eltrombopag and 29 to placebo). The 
majority of subjects (78%) were treated with 2 or more prior therapies. Baseline characteristics of each 
treatment  group  are  presented  in  Table  4.  The  majority  of  subjects  (88/92,  96%)  were  not 
splenectomised  at  baseline,  and  all  4  previously  splenectomised  subjects  in  PETIT2  were  randomized  to 
the  eltrombopag  group.  The  median  baseline  platelet  count  for  the  eltrombopag  group  was  13.65  Gi/L 
and for the placebo group was 11.0 Gi/L. 
Eltrombopag produced a clinically meaningful sustained platelet response in the paediatric population. A 
greater proportion of eltrombopag subjects achieved a response for at least 6 of 8 weeks (between Weeks 
5  through  12  of  the  Randomised  Period)  in  the  absence  of  rescue  treatment  in  comparison  to  placebo 
subjects (39.7% versus 3.4%; p<0.001). Sustained platelet response by splenectomy status is presented 
in Table 5. 
A  repeated  measures  analysis  of  platelet  response  over  12  weeks  of  therapy  during  the  Randomized 
Period was performed to understand the effect of treatment over time. This analysis accounts for between

and within subject variability in response. Results of this analysis indicated that for eltrombopag subjects, 
the  odds  of  continuing  to  maintain  a  (better)  response  profile  over  time  is  higher  than  for  placebo 
subjects (odds ratio: 25.33; 95% CI: 8.15, 78.73; p<0.001) 
TRA108062/PETIT + PETIT 2 (Pooled Paediatric Data) 
Pooled  data  from  the  2  paediatric  studies  showed  that  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  eltrombopag 
subjects achieved platelet counts ≥50 Gi/L at least once during the Randomised Period from Day 8 to 43 
(Weeks  1  to  6)  compared  with  placebo  subjects  (62.0%  versus  23.5%;  p<0.001).  Response  during 
Weeks 1 to 6 was analyzed by splenectomy status and is presented in Table 6. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH proposes to modify the indication statement for ITP patients who had an insufficient response to 
other  treatments  (e.g.  corticosteroids,  immunoglobulins  or  splenectomy)  to  allow  physicians  the 
opportunity  to  make  individualized  treatment  decisions,  including  the  use  of  eltrombopag  in  non-
splenectomised patients, if based upon their medical judgment that would be the most suitable option for 
their patient. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of this variation, the MAH has submitted data from the studies presented to support the initial 
MAA in the adult population (Studies TRA100773A [dose-finding], TRA100773B, and RAISE) together with 
a summary of the studies conducted in the paediatric population; however, these are being assessed in a 
parallel  procedure  (EMEA/H/C/1110/X/22/G)  and  could  not  be  considered  supportive  to  the  claimed 
extension of the indication. 
The  interim  analysis  of  the  EXTEND  study  was  submitted  as  supportive.  This  is  an  open  label  study  to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in subjects with cITP who have previously been enrolled 
in  any  of  the  following  studies:  TRA100773,  TRA102537/RAISE,  or  TRA108057/REPEAT.  Baseline 
characteristics  were  balanced  between  groups  based  on  splenectomy  status  except  that  more  patients 
had received ITP medication in the splenectomized arm than in the non-splenectomized subset (47% vs 
25%)  and  the  history  of  clinically  significant  bleeding  was  higher  in  splenectomised  than  non-
splenectomised  patients  (23%  vs  13%),  which    denotes  the  more  advanced  disease  status  of 
splenectomized patients. The cumulative exposure to eltrombopag was >6 months for the majority of the 
patients (86% in non-splenectomised and 82% in splenectomised) and more than half were exposed for 
>24 months in both arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 17/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
A total of 302 patients had been enrolled by the cut-off date of 6th April 2015. Of these, 62% (187) were 
non-splenectomised  and  the  majority  were  white  females  with  a  median  age  of  51  years  in  the  non-
splenectomized  and  48  years  in  the  splenectomized  groups.  Baseline  characteristics  were  balanced 
between groups except that more patients had received ITP medication in the splenectomized subset than 
in  the  non-splenectomized  subset  (47%  vs  25%)  and  that  patients’  history  of  clinically  significant 
bleeding  was  higher  in  splenectomised  than  non-splenectomised  patients  (23%  vs  13%).  These  data   
denote  the  more  advanced  disease  status  of  splenectomized  patients.  The  cumulative  exposure  to 
eltrombopag  was  >6  months  for  the  majority  of  the  patients  (86%  in  non-splenectomised  and  82%  in 
splenectomised) and more than half were exposed for >24 months in both arms.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The main evidence comes from the two phase III studies, where 311 patients were studied; 114 enrolled 
in the TRA100773B study and 197 in the RAISE study. Of these, 116 were splenectomised (35 in placebo 
and  81  eltrombopag  treated  arm)  and  195  were  non-splenectomized  (65  placebo-treated  and  130 
eltrombopag-treated).  The  longest  protocol-specified  time of  follow  up  was  6 months  in  the  RAISE  trial. 
The  results  from  these  studies  show  the  superiority  of  eltrombopag  compared  to  placebo  to  increase 
platelet  count  >50  x  109  /L  and  achieve  a  odds  (95%CI)  of  response  statistically  superior  either  in 
splenectomised (6.02 (1.89, 19.62) in the RAISE study and 9.63 (1.72, 53.76) in the TRA100773B study) 
or  non-splenectomised  patients  (9.41  (4.51,  19.62)  in  the  RAISE  study  and  12.00  (2.80,  51.46)  in  the 
TRA100773B  study),  with  a  higher  magnitude  of  the  short-term  effect  occurring  in  non-splenectomized 
patients.  
The evidence initially presented was limited to efficacy results in the short term (24-week at best in the 
RAISE  Study).  Studies,  including  TRA111433  and  TRA113765,  have  investigated  and  confirmed  the 
effectiveness  of  eltrombopag  in  cITP  patients  in  addition  to  the  long-term  safety  from  the 
TRA105325/EXTEND study.  
In the EXTEND study, more non-splenectomised subjects maintained a response for >50% and >75% of 
assessments  than  splenectomised  subjects  (67%  vs  51%  and  48%  vs  31%).  With  regard  to  WHO 
bleeding events, it is difficult to see a clear effect, although in both arms the number of events seems to 
decrease.  It  is  noted  that  this  endpoint  was  not  systematically  collected  and  the  number  of  subjects  at 
each  time  point  varied  throughout  the  study  duration.  With  regard  to  subjects  permanently  stopping  all 
ITP  medications  without  receiving  rescue,  better  results  were  seen  for  non-splenectomized  than 
splenectomized  patients  (38%  [18/47]  of  the  non-splenectomized  patients  who  were  taking  ITP 
medication  at  baseline,  20%  ]11/54]  of  the  splenectomised  patients).  The  results  of  the  proportion  of 
patients  that  permanently  interrupted  treatment  with  eltrombopag  show  similar  results  in  non-
splenectomized (4% [8/187]) and splenectomized patients (6% [7/115]). These 15 subjects maintained 
platelet  counts  ≥50  Gi/L  for  a  range  of  5  months  to  2.5  years  after  interrupting  eltrombopag  and  any 
other  ITP  medications.  Seven  subjects  (4%)  in  EXTEND  underwent  splenectomy  despite  treatment  with 
eltrombopag. 
Overall, these results support the positive effect of eltrombopag in non-splenectomized patients, which is 
very much in line with that observed in splenectomised patients.  
Splenectomy remains the standard treatment after failure of corticosteroids or IVIg, and offers a curative 
treatment option in about two thirds of patients. It is associated with few complications due to the use of 
current laparoscopic procedures.  
In  the  context  of  available  options,  Revolade  is  deemed  as  a  supportive  treatment  which  induces  a 
sustained effect on platelet counts. However, it is recognised that the benefits and risks of splenectomy 
are  well  established  and,  for  the  time  being,  it  offers  the  highest  rates  of  cure  with  durable  responses 
over  existing  second-line  treatment options,  even  though  surgery  may  not  be a  suitable  and immediate 
Assessment report

treatment  option  in  all  cases.  Thus,  the  availability  of  other  pharmacological  interventions  is  welcomed. 
Patients should be clinically evaluated periodically, and continuation of treatment should be decided on an 
individual basis by the treating physician. In non-splenectomised patients, this should include evaluation 
relative  to  splenectomy.  The  reoccurrence  of  thrombocytopenia  is  possible  upon  discontinuation  of 
treatment (see section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy  
The submitted data obtained in the paediatric population are of little value as supportive evidence of the 
claimed indication given the different roles of splenectomy in children and adults with cITP. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Eltrombopag  has  demonstrated  efficacy  in  both  splenectomized  and  non-splenectomized  patients  in  the 
clinical trials conducted and submitted within the original submission and, as expected, is reconfirmed by 
the current assessment.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of eltrombopag in the original MAA submission has been evaluated based on data from 
26  completed  or  ongoing  clinical  studies  in  1616  eltrombopag-treated  and  247  placebo-treated  healthy 
volunteers  and  patients  with  ITP,  hepatitis  C,  or  chemotherapy-induced  thrombocytopenia.  Adverse 
reactions  observed  during  eltrombopag  treatment 
included  headache  (13%);  nausea,  alanine 
aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased (4%); diarrhoea and fatigue (3%); 
paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia,  myalgia  and 
hyperbilirubinaemia  (2%),  abdominal  pain  upper,  alopecia,  dry  eye,  oedema  peripheral,  muscle  spasm, 
bone  pain,  hepatic  function  abnormal  and  insomnia  (1%).  Safety  concerns  included  hepatobiliary 
laboratory  abnormalities,  thromboembolic  events,  post-therapy  recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  bone 
marrow reticulin formation and risk of bone marrow fibrosis, haematological malignancies, cataracts, and 
loss of response to eltrombopag. 
Patient exposure 
As of 01 February 2010, across the adult ITP clinical development program, 446 subjects were exposed to 
eltrombopag, of which approximately 60% (273 subjects) were not splenectomised at baseline. The total 
observation period for the splenectomised group was 216.77 patient-years (PYs) compared to 367.64 PYs 
for the non-splenectomised group. 
In the 6 month pivotal RAISE study, 197 subjects were randomized to receive either placebo (n=62) or 
eltrombopag  50  mg  (n=135).  The  extent  of  exposure  was  summarized  by  the  number  of  days  on 
treatment and average daily dose. The median number of days on treatment was 183 days for both the 
placebo  and  eltrombopag  groups,  and  was  similar  regardless  of  splenectomy  status  at  baseline.  The 
median  average  daily  dose  for  the  eltrombopag  group  was  58.0  mg  (range  16,  72);  the  subjects  with 
prior  splenectomy  (n=50)  had  a  somewhat  higher  median  average  daily  dose  (64.0  mg,  range  16.3, 
72.4) than subjects without prior splenectomy (n=85, 52.9 mg, range 21.3, 72.3). 
Long-term  safety  of  eltrombopag  has  been  evaluated  in  the  ongoing,  long-term  extension  study, 
TRA105325/EXTEND. As of 01 February 2010, 299 subjects had been enrolled in EXTEND. The majority of 
Assessment report

subjects had baseline platelet counts <30 Gi/L (208 subjects, 70%), were not taking any concomitant ITP 
medications  at  baseline  (199  subjects,  67%),  and  were  not  splenectomised  at  baseline  (184  subjects, 
62%). The majority of subjects (210 subjects; 70%) have been exposed to eltrombopag in EXTEND for at 
least 1 year, and 138 subjects (46%) have been exposed to eltrombopag for at least 2 years (Table 9). 
The Applicant provided clarification of the pooled database of all cITP patients in the clinical program. For 
short-term exposure, the population included patients who had a duration of therapy up to 6 months. 
Studies TRA100773A (N=118), TRA100773B (N=114), RAISE (N=197), and TRA113765 (N=155) were 
used for the assessment of the short term safety profile of eltrombopag. These 4 studies are randomized, 
double-blind, parallel group, and placebo-controlled studies in adult subjects with chronic ITP. 
For the medium-term exposure, the population was restricted to patients who had a duration of therapy 
between 6 months and 2 years. The assessment of the medium-term safety profile of eltrombopag was 
performed using studies TRA112940 (N=162) and TRA105325/EXTEND (N=299), which were non-
randomized, open-label studies with a length of exposure of up to 2 years in the first and more than 2 
years for the second study. 
The  long-term  exploration  of  safety  was  limited  to  patients  who  had  more  than  2  years  of  eltrombopag 
exposure. The long-term analysis of safety was conducted using the EXTEND study, as only the EXTEND 
study meets the criterion for long term exposure of >2 years. 
Adverse events 
The  overall incidence  of on-therapy  AEs,  SAEs,  treatment-related  AEs,  and  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  in 
pooled  data  from  TRA100773A,  TRA100773B  and  RAISE  was  similar  when  comparing  the  placebo  and 
eltrombopag  groups  (Table  7).  The  incidence  of  events  was  similar  between  splenectomised  and  non-
splenectomised subjects.

Common Adverse Events 
The AE profile was similar between the non-splenectomised and splenectomised eltrombopag groups. The 
incidence  of each  common  AE  in  the  non-splenectomised eltrombopag  group was  the  same or  less  than 
the  splenectomised  group  receiving  eltrombopag,  with  the  exception  of  urinary  tract  infection.  Urinary 
tract  infection  was  more  common  in  non-splenectomised  subjects  than  splenectomised  subjects  in  both 
treatment groups.

Long-Term Safety in Adult Chronic ITP 
Long-term  safety  of  eltrombopag  has  been  evaluated  in  the  ongoing,  long-term  extension  study, 
TRA105325/EXTEND. As of 01 February 2010, 299 subjects had been enrolled in EXTEND. 
Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation and Fibrosis 
The  risk  of  bone  marrow  reticulin  formation  and  fibrosis  was  assessed in  the TRA105325/EXTEND  study 
as  a  postmarketing  requirement  in  the  US  and  a  risk  management  plan  commitment  in  the  EU.  The 
following is a summary of the findings in bone marrow biopsy reports received as of 23 March 2010. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 22/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The table 10 shows the summary of the maximum reticulin grade at different on-treatment time intervals, 
based  on  each  subject’s  first  exposure  to  eltrombopag  in  any  study.  As  of  23  March  2010,  223  on-
treatment bone marrow biopsy results were available from 171 subjects; 204 biopsies from 159 subjects 
were  stained  for  reticulin  and  graded  using  the  European  (EU)  Consensus  scale  (MF)  and  constitute  the 
basis for the analysis herein presented. 
Shifts in Reticulin Grade from First Assessment 
In  an  additional  analysis,  shifts  in  MF  grade  between  the  first  on-treatment  bone  marrow  biopsy  in 
EXTEND  and  the  second  on-treatment  biopsy  were  evaluated  for  the  42  subjects  with  2  biopsies 
performed. 
Less than 10 months between first and second bone marrow assessments (n=3): 
- 1 subject had MF-0 on both assessments. 
- 1 subject shifted from MF-0 to MF-1  
- 1 subject shifted from MF-1 to MF-0 
10 to <22 months between first and second bone marrow assessments (n=38 [1 missing sample]): 
- 24 subjects had MF-0 on both assessments. 
- 3 subjects shifted from MF-0 to MF-1 
- 3 subjects had MF-1 on both assessments. 
- 6 subjects shifted from MF-1 to MF-0  
- 1 subject shifted from MF-2 to MF-0 
22 to <34 months between first and second bone marrow assessments (n=2): 
- 1 subject shifted from MF-0 to MF-2  
- 1 subject shifted from MF-1 to MF-0 
A total of 5 subjects had a shift to a higher MF score over the observation period and a total of 9 subjects 
had  a  shift  to  a  lower  MF  score  over  the  observation  period.  Overall,  no  pattern  of  increased  reticulin 
deposition after a longer treatment period was apparent in these subjects. 
Three  subjects  interrupted  treatment  with  eltrombopag  due  to  bone  marrow  findings.  One  subject  had 
collagen fibers reported and the investigator withdrew him pre-emptively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 23/37 
 
  
  
 
The second subject had a report of moderate increase in collagen and a loss of response concomitant to 
starting  a  calcium  supplement;  she  experienced  a  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage  due  to  a  duodenal 
arteriovenous  fistula  and the  investigator  decided  to  withdraw  her  from  the trial.  Both  of  these  subjects 
had  reticulin  documented  in  bone  marrow  biopsies  taken  before  exposure  to  eltrombopag.  The  third 
subject was found to have an MF-1 in the routine bone marrow biopsy after a year of treatment, and the 
investigator chose to withdraw her pre-emptively. 
Hepatobiliary Events 
Many medications have the potential to induce liver injury, which can range from a transient, self-limited 
increase  in  aminotransferases  to  a  severe  liver  injury  and  liver  failure.  Hepatotoxicity  was  assessed 
because  of  evidence  of  liver  toxicity  in  non-clinical  studies.  There  were  no  direct  hepatobiliary-related 
deaths and no lasting clinical sequelae. The majority of events resolved prior to the clinical cut-off date in 
most cases despite continuation of treatment. Indirect bilirubin increases were found in several patients, 
most  likely  due  to  inhibition  of  the  OATP1B1  transporter.  These  elevations  of  indirect  bilirubin  are 
considered of little clinical significance. 
Thromboembolic Events 
As of 01 February 2010, a total of 16 subjects in EXTEND and 20 subjects out of 446 (4.5%) exposed to 
eltrombopag across the ITP program have experienced thromboembolic events. 
Of the 16 subjects in EXTEND, 8 subjects had events that were venous in nature, 6 subjects had arterial 
events, and 2 subjects had both. The incidence of thromboembolic events in EXTEND as of this 2010 cut-
off date was 3.14/100 PY (95% CI [1.92, 4.85]); this is consistent with published literature for patients 
with chronic ITP.

Cataracts 
Based  on  sponsor  review  of  the  ocular  data  from  EXTEND,  a  total  of  40  subjects  had  a  cataract  event 
during  EXTEND.  Of  these  40  subjects,  15  subjects had  progression  of  preexisting  cataracts,  17  subjects 
had  an  incident  cataract,  and  8  subjects  had  an  incident  cataract  which  also  progressed  during  the 
observation period in EXTEND. These data will be reviewed and adjudicated by the Ocular Clinical Events 
Committee in the final EXTEND clinical study report. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 25/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
All  40  subjects  with  a  cataract  event  had  at  least  1  risk  factor  for  cataractogenesis  reported  by  the 
examining ophthalmologist, had documented use of corticosteroids, or were 60 years or older. 
Neoplasms  
In  order  to  present  a  causality  analysis  of  all  neoplasms  occurring  after  more  than  2  years  exposure  in 
the  cITP  indication,  data  from  the  EXTEND  study  was  used  since  the  treatment  duration  for  all  other 
global  adult  cITP  studies  was  2  years  or  less.  Five  SAEs  (in  5  patients)  and  6  non-serious  AEs  (in  5 
patients)  concerned  events  from  the  EXTEND  study  within  the  MedDRA  Neoplasms  SOC  with  an  onset 
after 720 days of eltrombopag treatment. There were 6 non-serious reports (in 5 patients) containing PTs 
within the Neoplasms SOC. 
It is highly unlikely that any of the described SAEs were associated with the study medication 
Safety in special populations 
Supportive Safety in Paediatric Chronic ITP 
There were a total of 174 paediatric subjects enrolled in both studies and 171 subjects received at least 1 
dose of eltrombopag at any time during the studies. 
In the Safety Population, the median average daily dose of blinded study medication was 47.5 mg in the 
eltrombopag group. The median average daily dose in each study cohort was as follows: Cohort 1: 53.3 
mg; Cohort 2: 50.0 mg; and Cohort 3: 27.1 mg. In the All Eltrombopag Treated Population, the average 
daily  dose  was  55.3  mg  across  all  cohorts  and  the  median  average  daily  dose  in  each  cohort  was  as 
follows: Cohort 1: 64.0 mg; Cohort 2: 57.6 mg; and Cohort 3: 37.0 mg. 
No notable differences in average daily dose were seen in East Asian subjects when compared with non-
East Asian subjects, despite the reduced starting doses in East Asian subjects. 
Overall, there were 128 (75%) subjects who received >24 weeks of treatment with eltrombopag. 
Adverse Events 
The  safety  profile  observed  in  paediatric  subjects  with  chronic  ITP  is  consistent  with  what  has  been 
reported  for  eltrombopag  in  adults  with  chronic  ITP;  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified  in  the 
paediatric ITP population with doses of eltrombopag up to 75 mg. 
Overall,  the  number  of  subjects  in  the  randomized  period  (Safety  Population)  who  reported  an  AE  was 
similar  between  the  treatment  groups  (82.0%  placebo;  81.3%  eltrombopag).  There  were  few  serious 
adverse events (SAEs) in  either treatment group (12% placebo; 8% eltrombopag) and few AEs that led 
to discontinuation of study treatment (2% placebo; 3% eltrombopag). 
The  AEs  reported  were  consistent  with  the  established  safety  profile  of  eltrombopag  or  the  population 
under study. The most common AEs in the eltrombopag group (≥10% of subjects) were headache, upper 
respiratory tract infection, and nasopharyngitis with the latter 2 being reported in a higher proportion of 
subjects receiving eltrombopag when compared with the placebo group. The most common AEs reported 
in  the  placebo  group  (≥10%  of  subjects)  were  headache,  epistaxis,  vomiting,  nausea,  and  upper 
abdominal  pain,  all  of  which  were  reported  in  a  higher  proportion  of  subjects  when  compared  to  the 
eltrombopag group. 
In  the  Safety  Population,  SAEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the  placebo  group  (12%)  than  in  the 
eltrombopag group (8.4%). With the exception of epistaxis, which was reported in 2 placebo subjects, no 
SAE  was  reported  by  more  than  1  subject  in  either  treatment  group.  In  the  eltrombopag  group,  ALT 
increases  and  events  of  neutropenia  were the  most  common  SAEs,  whereas bleeding events  were  more 
common in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 26/37 
 
  
  
In  the  Safety  Population,  elevations  in  ALT  >3x  ULN  were  more  frequent  in  the  eltrombopag  group 
(4.7%)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (0%).  No  subject  had  an  elevation  of  ALT  >3x  ULN  in 
conjunction with total bilirubin elevation >1.5x ULN during the Randomised Period. Of the 5 subjects with 
an elevation of ALT >3x ULN in the Randomised Period of PETIT2, 2 subjects (1 White; 1 East Asian) had 
increases  in  ALT  >5x  ULN,  which  met  the  protocol  defined  liver  chemistry  stopping  criteria.  For  both 
subjects, the events were reported as AEs, and resolved following discontinuation of study treatment. 
Detailed  ocular  assessments  were  performed  throughout  the  studies  and  subjects  meeting  predefined 
criteria  were  reviewed  by  the  ocular  Clinical  Events  Committee  (CEC).  Based  on  the  CEC  review,  2 
eltrombopag  subjects  and  no  placebo  subjects  had  a  cataract  event.  Both  subjects  had  either  reported 
corticosteroid  use  as  a  risk  factor  or  were  receiving  corticosteroids  as  an  ongoing  ITP  medication.  While 
eltrombopag cannot be excluded as a causative factor in these events, concurrent use of corticosteroids, 
a known cataractogenic medication, confounds the interpretation of these cases. 
No thromboembolic events were reported. 
Renal abnormalities were infrequent and were mild and transient. The data do not indicate a relationship 
between  eltrombopag  treatment  and  renal  abnormalities.  One  malignancy  event  (thyroid  papillary 
carcinoma) was reported 20 months after the discontinuation of eltrombopag treatment. The investigator 
considered  the  event  unrelated  to  study  treatment.  No  events  indicative  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis  were 
reported.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AE leading to withdrawal was higher in splenectomised, see below table. 
Post marketing experience 
Based  on  IMS  (Intercontinental  Medical  Statistics)  Health  data,  the  cumulative  postmarketing  exposure 
from 08 November 2008 (1st worldwide approval) through 31 December 2013 is estimated to be 28,127 
patient-years.  This  estimate  was  produced  in  April  2014  and  was  based  on  the  latest  data  available  at 
that time (December 2013).

The most recently received PSUR with regard to Revolade covered the reporting period 01 October 2013 
to 30 September 2014. According to the PSUR, an estimated 3,976 subjects in total have been exposed 
to Revolade in sponsored ongoing and completed interventional studies of which 640 are from completed 
studies  (including  the  studies  presented  in  this  Assessment  Report);  648  are  from  ongoing  studies  in 
patients with ITP.  
Cumulative post-marketing exposure to Revolade is estimated to be to 35,612 patient years. Revolade is 
currently approved for the treatment of chronic ITP in over 95 countries worldwide including the United 
States, EU, and Japan. From the Table 1-4 below, the cumulative patient years of therapy in the US for 
both 25 mg and 50 mg combined is 8,715 patient years as compared to 6,886 patient years of therapy in 
EU5. The 16-month lag in approvals between the EU and US would be expected to contribute less 
utilization in the EU regardless of any indication limitations. From cumulative patient years of therapy it is 
challenging to separate the differences in cumulative patient years of therapy as due to either launch 
timings versus indication limitations. 
Source: IMS data 
Doses of 12.5 mg daily to 75 mg daily are approved for treatment of chronic ITP worldwide. Revolade is 
also currently approved for treatment of adult patients with chronic  hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for 
the  treatment  of  thrombocytopenia  in  order  to  maintain  optimal  interferon-based  therapy  in  over  45 
countries worldwide including the United States and all European Union Member States at doses of 25 mg 
daily to 100 mg daily. Revolade is also currently approved for the treatment of severe aplastic anaemia in 
the United States at doses of 25 mg daily to 150 mg daily. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 28/37 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
In  the  EU  PSUR  6,  a  cumulative  review  of  hepatotoxicity  was  conducted  by  searching  the  GSK  global 
safety database (OCEANS) to identify eltrombopag post-marketing and spontaneous cases with preferred 
terms  (PTs)  in  the  drug-related  hepatic  disorders  –  a  comprehensive  search  SMQ  received  cumulatively 
through 31 August 2013. A total of 352 cases reporting 552 hepatic events were identified and reviewed. 
In  212  cases  (60.2%)  the  hepatic  events  were  serious  and  in  140  cases  the  hepatic  events  were 
nonserious. 
Relevant laboratory data were provided in 223 of the 352 cases. Of these, 60 reported ALT or AST levels 
≥5x ULN. In 38 of these 60 cases, the events resolved or improved, including 32 cases demonstrating a 
positive  de-challenge.  In  32  of  these  60  cases,  the  reporter  considered  the  events  related  to 
eltrombopag.  In  15  cases,  the  events  were  considered  unrelated  and  no  causality  assessment  was 
reported in 13 cases. In summary, the identified reports generally describe mild and transient elevations 
in LFTs, which resolve upon eltrombopag discontinuation. However, several reports of hepatic failure and 
severe  hepatic injury,  some  of  which  required liver  transplantation or  resulted  in  death,  were identified. 
Many  of  these  reports  describe  liver  failure  or  severe  liver  injury  in  patients  receiving  eltrombopag  for 
thrombocytopenia associated with preexisting chronic liver disease. 
This  review  did  not  identify  any  new  trends  or  changes  compared  with  previous  analyses  of 
hepatotoxicity. The data was consistent with the known safety profile of eltrombopag. 
In  addition,  during  the  5-year  renewal  period,  a  review  of  cases  of  hepatotoxicity  received  between  01 
September 2013 and 11 March 2014 was consistent with the known safety profile of eltrombopag. 
The  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  is  described  in  the  Warnings  and  Precautions  section  of  the  eltrombopag 
reference safety information (RSI). 
Thromboembolic Events  
In March 2011, a search of the GSK global safety database was performed for cases with eltrombopag as 
the  suspect  drug  and  the  MedDRA  version  13.1  SMQ  for  embolic  and  thrombotic  events.  One  hundred 
forty-six (146) reports were retrieved and reviewed that had at least one event within this MedDRA SMQ. 
The review focused on thromboembolic events (TEEs) and was reported in detail in PSUR-2 (01 October 
2010 to  31  March  2011). No  new  trends  or  changes  in  incidence or  severity  of  TEEs  emerged  based  on 
the  analysis  of  those  146  reports.  No  specific  risk  factors  were  identified  that  allow  a  differentiation 
between those subjects with ITP who experienced a TEE and those who did not. 
Subsequent  reviews  of  thromboembolic  events  were  conducted  in  PSURs  3,  4,  and  5  and  PBRER-1/EU 
PSUR-6. These reviews did not identify any new trends or changes the safety profile of eltrombopag. The 
benefit/risk  profile  of  eltrombopag  for  the  treatment  of  previously  treated  patients  with  chronic  ITP  to 
increase platelet counts and reduce or prevent bleeding continued to be favourable. 
In addition, during the 5-year renewal period, a review of cases of TEEs received between 01 September 
2013 and 11 March 2014 was consistent with the known safety profile of eltrombopag. The risk of TEEs is 
described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the eltrombopag RSI. 
Cataract 
Cataract is considered an important identified risk, which has been closely monitored. Post-marketing and 
spontaneous reports were retrieved from the GSK worldwide safety database (OCEANS) with eltrombopag 
as  the  suspect  drug  and  MedDRA  SMQ  lens  disorder.  From  spontaneous  sources,  there  were  13  reports 
and 20 adverse events received from spontaneous sources related to eye disorders with preferred terms 
of  cataract  (3),  visual  acuity  reduced  (2),  visual  impairment  (6),  and  vision  blurred  (7)  from  SMQ  lens 
disorder,  and  preferred  terms  of  blindness  and  vitreous  floaters  (1  each)  were  also  reported  in  these 
cases.  The  majority  of  these  17  post-marketing  and  spontaneous  cases  presented  patients  with  specific 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 29/37 
 
  
  
 
information  regarding  blurred  vision  or  vision  impairment.  In  cases  where  cataract  or  visual  acuity  was 
specifically  reported,  limited  information  was  provided.  Overall,  the  reports  from  spontaneous  and  post 
marketing sources provide limited information on the potential risk of cataract. 
Period reviews of cataract were conducted in PSURs 1, 3, 4, and 5, and PBRER/EU PSUR-6. These reviews 
have not identified any new trends or changes in the safety profile of eltrombopag. 
During  the  5-year  renewal  period,  a  review  of  cases  of  cataract  received  between  01  September  2013 
and 11 March 2014 was consistent with the known  safety profile of eltrombopag. The risk of cataract is 
described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the eltrombopag RSI. 
Important Potential Risks; Potential for Increased Bone Marrow Reticulin Formation, 
Reviews of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis were conducted in PSURs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. In PBRER/EU PSUR 
6,  a  cumulative  review  of  bone  marrow  reticulin  fibrosis  was  conducted  by  searching  the  GSK  global 
safety  database  (OCEANS)  to  identify  eltrombopag  cases  with  PTs  in  the  haematopoietic  cytopenias 
affecting  more  than  one  type  of  blood  cell  SMQ,  the  malignancy-related  conditions  SMQ,  and  the  blood 
premalignant  disorders  SMQ  received  through  31  August  2013.  A  total  of  48  cases  were  identified  that 
described possible bone marrow reticulin fibrosis. In 21 of the 48 cases, information on the Bauermeister 
grade of the bone marrow was provided. For the majority of cases in which the information was available 
(21 cases), bone marrow reticulin fibrosis was Bauermeister Grade 1 (13 cases). In the remaining cases, 
limited  information  on  the  degree  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis  was  provided.  Furthermore,  in  most  reports, 
the  degree  of  bone  marrow  reticulin  fibrosis  at  baseline  was  not  provided.  Finally,  other  cases  were 
complicated  by  concurrent  medical  conditions  including  myelodysplastic  syndrome,  AML,  chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and unspecified malignancy. 
During the 5-year renewal period, a review of cases of bone marrow reticulin formation and bone marrow 
fibrosis received between 01 September 2013 and 11 March 2014 was consistent with the known safety 
profile  of  eltrombopag.  The  potential  for  bone  marrow  reticulin  formation  and  bone  marrow  fibrosis  is 
described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the eltrombopag RSI. 
Haematological Malignancies 
Cumulative  reviews  of  haematological  malignancies  were  conducted  in  PSURs  2  and  3.  The  review  in 
PSUR  3  identified  a  total  of  126  cases  of  haematological  malignancies.  Of  these  126  cases,  112  were 
found  to  contain 
insufficient 
information 
for  assessment,  describe  patients  with  pre-existing 
haematological malignancy, or were unlikely to be caused by eltrombopag based on timing of the event 
relative to treatment. 
This  review  concluded  that  no  safety  signal  with  regard  to  haematological  malignancy  was  identified 
based on nonclinical and clinical experience with eltrombopag. 
Subsequent  reviews  of  haematological  malignancies  were  conducted  in  PSURs  4,  5  and  PBRER/PSUR  6. 
These reviews did not identify any new trends or changes the safety profile of eltrombopag. 
In addition, a review of cases of haematological malignancies received between 01 September 2013 and 
11 March 2014 was consistent with the known safety profile of eltrombopag. The risk of haematological 
malignancies is described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the eltrombopag RSI. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of eltrombopag in the original MAA submission has been evaluated based on data from 
26  completed  or  ongoing  clinical  studies  in  1616  eltrombopag-treated  and  247  placebo-treated  healthy 
Assessment report

volunteers and patients with ITP,  hepatitis C, or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. The doses of 
eltrombopag  used  in  these  studies  ranged  from  3  mg  to  200  mg.  The  duration  of  treatment  with 
eltrombopag ranged from 1 day in healthy volunteers up to 560 days in subjects with chronic ITP. 
Adverse  reactions  observed  during  eltrombopag  treatment  included  headache  (13%);  nausea,  alanine 
aminotransferase increased and aspartate aminotransferase increased (4%); diarrhoea and fatigue (3%); 
paraesthesia,  constipation,  rash,  pruritus,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  cataract,  arthralgia,  myalgia  and 
hyperbilirubinaemia  (2%),  abdominal  pain  upper,  alopecia,  dry  eye,  oedema  peripheral,  muscle  spasm, 
bone pain, hepatic function abnormal and insomnia (1%). 
Safety  concerns  included  hepatobiliary  laboratory  abnormalities,  thromboembolic  events,  post-therapy 
recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  bone  marrow  reticulin  formation  and  risk  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis, 
haematological malignancies, cataracts and loss of response to eltrombopag. 
Eltrombopag  administration  can  cause  abnormal  liver  function.  In  clinical  studies  with  eltrombopag, 
increases in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin were 
observed. Findings were mostly mild (Grade 1-2), reversible, and not accompanied by clinically significant 
symptoms  that  would  indicate  an  impaired  liver  function.  Across  the  3  placebo-controlled  studies,  1 
patient  in  the  placebo  group  and  1  patient  in  the  eltrombopag  group  experienced  a  Grade  4  liver  test 
abnormality. 
Among  446  adult  chronic  ITP  patients  receiving  eltrombopag,  20  subjects  experienced  thromboembolic 
events, which included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, cerebral 
infarction,  embolism,  transient  ischaemic  attack,  and  suspected  PRIND  (prolonged  reversible  ischemic 
neurologic deficiency). The risk of thromboembolic events has been found to be increased in patients with 
chronic  liver  disease  treated  with  eltrombopag.  These  findings  have  been  considered  unlikely  to  be 
relevant to the ITP patient population (conclusion supported by an ad hoc expert group). 
The  induction  of  reticulin  formation  and  the  potential  development  of  bone  marrow  fibrosis  is  a  serious 
safety concern. There are limited data suggesting that eltrombopag is associated with reticulin formation 
in  the  bone  marrow  (collagen  formation  in  2  cases);  however,  whether  this  is  a  finding  likely  to  have 
clinical consequences on the long term is still uncertain. In addition, for Mpl ligands such as eltrombopag, 
there  is  a  theoretical  concern  that  they  may  stimulate  the  growth  of  haematopoietic  malignancies  or 
increase progression of MDS to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).  
The Applicant has now characterized the safety profile of eltrombopag from the MA up to 11-March-2014; 
including  data  from  the  main  studies  in  the  adult  population,  data  from  the  long-term  safety  study 
(TRA105325/EXTEND)  in  adults,  the  results  of  the  paediatric  population,  and  the  post-marketing 
experience has been submitted in a brief synopsis. 
As of 01 February 2010, across the adult ITP clinical development program, 446 subjects were exposed to 
eltrombopag, of which approximately 60% (273 subjects) were non splenectomised at baseline. Of them, 
a  total  428  patients  were  included  in  the  main  clinical  studies  TRA100773A,  TRA1007773B,  and  RAISE. 
The occurrence of adverse events is higher in splenectomized than non-splenectomized patients (77% vs 
65%) and the same occur with regard to drug-related adverse events (37% vs 28%).  This might well be 
explained  by  the  more  advanced  disease  status  of  splenectomized  patients,  but  there  is  not  data  to 
confirm  it.  With  regard  to  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  the  percentages  do  not  seem 
remarkably different. 
No  major  differences  were  observed  in  the  safety  profile  between  splenectomised  and  non-
splenectomised  subjects.  A  comparative  exercise  between  non-splenectomised  and  splenectomised 
patients  reveals  a  safety  profile  similar  in  both  groups  although  the  incidence  of  serious  AEs  appears  
higher  in  splenectomized  (25.87  [19.97,  32.25])  than  in  non-splenectomized  (15.14  [12.43,18.26])

patients.  This  is  not  unexpected  given  the  more  advanced  and  potentially  severe  disease  status  of 
patients undergoing surgery. 
Results from the EXTEND study on the proportion of patients that permanently interrupted treatment with 
eltrombopag show similar results in non-splenectomized (4% [8/187]) and splenectomized patients (6% 
[7/115]).  These  15  subjects  maintained  platelet  counts  ≥50  Gi/L  for  a  range  of  5  months  to  2.5  years 
after  interrupting  eltrombopag  and  any  other  ITP  medications.  Seven  subjects  (4%)  in  EXTEND 
underwent splenectomy despite treatment with eltrombopag 
The Applicant has provided an adequate overview of the safety profile with regard to the temporality of 
the  adverse  events,  those  associated  with  the  tolerance  and  resolve  while  the  therapy  continues  and 
which are more specific to long term use. All this information as already reflected in the SmPC, and does 
not  require  any  further  changes  whether  or  not  there  was  a  broader  use  in  the  non-splenectomised 
population. In order to provide awareness to the physician that clinical decisions on  treatment should be 
put in the context of safety in the long term, a statement is now included in the SmPC to point out that 
clinical  studies  comparing  eltrombopag  to  other  treatment  options  (e.g.  splenectomy)  have  not  been 
conducted. The long-term safety of eltrombopag should be considered prior to starting therapy. 
The experience from 28,000 patients-years of exposure in the world-wide post marketing setting has not 
raised any new safety finding and corroborates the profile described in the SmPC. The splenectomy status 
is unknown for these patients, but keeping in mind that in many regions the approved label does not limit 
its use to splenectomised patients, both should be represented to an extent. A review of the cumulative 
events  in  patients  who  were  splenectomized  after  eltrombopag  initiation  did  not  reveal  a  change  in  the 
pattern  of  the  events.  The  majority  of  the  most  frequently  reported  events  in  patients  who  were 
splenectomized  after  eltrombopag  initiation  were listed  as per the  SmPC,  and  the  instructions  on  use  of 
product and monitoring of platelet counts has been adequately described in the SmPC. 
All  experience  accumulated  confirms  the  important  identified  risks  of  hepatotoxicity,  thromboembolic 
events, and the potential risks of bone marrow reticulin formation and haematological malignancies.   
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
The safety profile observed in children, who were predominantly non-splenectomised, is not considered as 
relevant to the adult population, which is the objective of this variation procedure. These data are under 
evaluation in a parallel procedure (EMEA/H/C/1110/X/22/G). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of eltrombopag in cITP patients is well characterized. In general, eltrombopag is well 
tolerated and most common toxicities are predictable. A priori, no major differences would be expected 
between splenectomised and non-splenectomised patients. Long-term safety, in particular bone marrow 
and haematological effects, remains of concern and will continue to be monitored through the PSURs and 
the RMP.  
In the SmPC, it is stated that clinical studies comparing eltrombopag to other treatment options (e.g. 
splenectomy) have not been conducted. The long-term safety of eltrombopag should be considered prior 
to starting therapy. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
Assessment report  
EMA/38474/2016 
Page 32/37 
 
  
  
 
 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list, which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH that no RMP update is needed. The safety profile of patients treated with 
eltrombopag does not appear to differ based on splenectomy status, providing physicians with more 
options for treatment. Also the benefit risk remains positive and the indication remains second line for 
patients refractory to other treatments. Latest updated RMP includes information on all the clinical studies 
used to support this change to the indication and therefore has not been updated for this submission. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Eltrombopag  was  approved  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  ITP  in  adult  patients  based  upon  study  results 
from  3  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trials.  These  data  demonstrated  that  eltrombopag 
treatment  resulted  in  a  significant  elevation  of  platelet  counts  to  safe  levels  up  to  6  month  treatment 
period in chronic ITP, in both splenectomised (116, 35 in placebo) and non-splenectomised patients (195, 
65 in placebo).  The results from these studies show the superiority of eltrombopag compared to placebo 
to increase the platelet count > 50 x 109 /L and achieve a odds (95%IC)  of response statistically superior 
either  in  splenectomized    (6.02  (1.89,19.62)  in  RAISE  study  and  9.63  (1.72,53.76)  in  TRA100773B 
study)  and  non-splenectomized  patients  (9.41  (4.51,19.62)  in  RAISE  study  and  12.00(2.80,  51.46)  in 
TRA 100773B study) , indeed the magnitude of the effect is greater in non-splenectomized patients. 
Data  from  the  EXTEND  study,  in  which  the  62%  of  the  population  enrolled  were  non-splenectomized 
patients,  confirm  efficacy,  with  48%  of  non-splenectomized  patients  and  the  31%  of  splenectomized 
patients showing platelet counts >50 Gi/L for >75% of the assessment and  67% of non-splenectomised 
and 51% of splenectomised patients showing platelet counts  > 50Gi/L for >50% of assessments.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no new uncertainties about the beneficial effects. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As of 01 February 2010, across the adult ITP clinical development program, 446 subjects were exposed to 
eltrombopag,  of  which  approximately  60%  (273  subjects)  were  not  splenectomised  at  baseline.  The 
occurrence  of  adverse  events  was  higher  in  splenectomized  patients  than  non-splenectomized  (77%  vs

65%) and the same occur with regard to drug related adverse events (37% vs 28%). With regard to SAE 
and AE leading to discontinuation the percentages do not seem remarkably different. 
Similar safety profiles were seen for non-splenectomized and splenectomized patients, with the exception 
of  urinary  tract  infections  that  were  more  common  in  non-splenectomized  subjects.  A  review  of  the 
cumulative  events  in  patients  who  were  splenectomized  after  eltrombopag  initiation  did  not  reveal  a 
change in the pattern of the events, the majority of the most frequently reported events in patients who 
were splenectomized after eltrombopag initiation were listed as per the SmPC and the instructions on use 
of product and monitoring of the platelet counts has been adequately described in the SmPC. 
No  new  risks  were  identified;  main  safety  concerns  in  the  adult  population  remain  and  include: 
hepatotoxicity,  thromboembolic  events,  hepatic  decompensation,  and  post  therapy  reocurrence  of 
thrombocytopenia. Appropriate risk minimization measures are addressed in the SmPC and RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
There  are  still  uncertainties  in  relation  to  hepatotoxicity,  potential  haematological  changes  (leukocytosis 
and  anaemia,  cases  of  thrombocytosis),  recurrence  of  thrombocytopenia,  malignancies  (haematological) 
and  renal  tubular  toxicity/renal  failure.  These  uncertainties  encompass  to  non-splenectomised  and 
splenectomised patients. Appropriate risk minimization measures are already addressed in the SmPC and 
RMP. 
No  new  uncertainties  have  been  identified,  long  term  safety  remains  of  concern  and  appropriate 
statements on the context of other treatment options are included in the SmPC.

 Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The short-term benefits of eltrombopag in terms of platelet count increments above the level of bleeding 
risk  was  initially  demonstrated  and  replicated  in  two  phase  3  randomized  clinical  trials  which  included 
both splenectomized and non-splenectomized subjects with cITP. Additional long-term  analysis from the 
EXTEND Study show that the effect tend to be  maintained in the long run, with a trend for a reduction of 
bleeding  events,  as  well  as  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  concomitant  ITP  medication  (mainly 
corticosteroid).  However,  remission  is  not  to  be  expected  in  relation  to  eltrombopag  treatment,  thus 
Revolade  should  be  considered  a  supportive  treatment  option  and  its  long  term  use  should  be  weighed 
against the option of splenectomy.

The  main  safety  concerns,  potential  and  identified,  include  hepatotoxicity,  cataracts,  potential 
haematological  changes  (leukocytosis  and  anaemia,  cases  of 
thrombocytosis),  recurrence  of 
thrombocytopenia,  malignancies  (haematological)  and  renal  tubular  toxicity/renal  failure,  increased 
reticulin formation and bone marrow fibrosis.  
In  the  context  of  limited  treatment  options,  benefits  of  the  treatment  are  considered  to  overweigh  the 
risks for patients with cITP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit  /  risk balance  in  the  indication:  “Revolade is  indicated  for  adult  chronic  immune  (idiopathic) 
thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP)  patients  who  are  refractory  to  other  treatments  (e.g.  corticosteroids, 
immunoglobulins). (See Section 4.2 and 5.1) is positive 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Eltrombopag  has  demonstrated  to  increase  platelet  counts  above  a  level  which  reduces  the  risk  of 
bleeding  events  in  up  to  60%  of  subjects.  Responses  were  seen  in  splenectomised  and  non-
splenectomized patients, although responses tend to be lower in splenectomised patients likely due to the 
more  advanced  status  of  the  disease.  The  effect  is  considered  clinically  relevant,  substantiated  by  an 
apparent  favourable  effect  observed  in  the  overall  incidence  of  bleeding  events.    However,  contrary  to 
other treatment options available, eltrombopag does not interfere with the underlying pathophysiological 
autoimmune  disorder  of  the  condition,  but  rather  stimulates  platelet  production  with  the  aim  to 
compensate  peripheral  platelet  destruction.  Thus,  remission  is  unlikely  during  eltrombopag  treatment. 
Although  well  tolerated,  eltrombopag  may  be  associated  with  the  risk  of  thromboembolic  complications, 
bone marrow fibrosis and progression to haematological malignancies.  
Splenectomy remains as the standard second-line treatment for adults with ITP, given that it provides the 
highest overall success rate, with approximately two thirds of patients remaining in clinical remission 5-
10  years  after  splenectomy.  Laparoscopic  surgery  has  sought  to  use  minimally  invasive  techniques  to 
reduce  postoperative  pain,  reduce  the  duration  of  hospitalization,  minimize  complications  and  increase 
speed of recovery.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
In neurosurgery, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is considered to be one of the most challenging and 
potentially dangerous complications. Among the envelopes which contain and protect the neural structures, 
the dura mater is the only one that can be surgically repaired. Watertight closure of the dura is the first line 
of protection from postoperative CSF leakage, which can lead to other serious complications such as 
meningitis and delayed wound healing. (1) 
Fibrin sealants -generally containing two major components, fibrinogen and thrombin - manufactured from 
pooled human plasma have been used in surgery since the 1970s both  for haemostatic purposes but also for 
sealing, reinforcement of sutures and tissue adhesion (2, 3, 4). 
TachoSil is a sealant matrix coated with two active substances human thrombin and human fibrinogen.   
TachoSil is currently approved for use in adults for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of 
hemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, and for suture support in vascular surgery where standard 
techniques are insufficient. The current tissue sealing label is based on study data for the sealing efficacy 
and safety in lung and cardiovascular surgery, demonstrating tight sealing against physiological pressures in 
the lung and the arterial circulation. 
The Applicant is seeking to expand the indication in neurosurgery to include supportive sealing of the dura 
mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery , and thereby, to 
remove the warning currently included in Section 4.4 concerning lack of data for use in neurosurgery. 
Study TC-2402-038-SP, or TachoSil against Liquor Leak (TASALL), is a recently completed study evaluating 
the use of TachoSil for the prevention of postoperative CSF leaks in skull base surgery. 
The effect of TachoSil in preventing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage is primarily attributed to the 
fibrinogen/thrombin components. The mechanism of action of TachoSil is based on the interaction of the 
thrombin and fibrinogen components leading to the deposition of a local fibrin clot with pronounced adhesive 
properties, thus gluing the patch to the dural membrane. 
The current indication of TachoSil is proposed to be extended by adding: 
TachoSil is indicated in adults for supportive treatment in surgery for improvement of haemostasis, to 
promote tissue sealing, for suture support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are insufficient, 
and for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following 
neurological surgery.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, some relevant data from the original 
application are summarised here: 
A neurosurgery study was performed in rabbits in which TachoSil (named TachoComb S in this report) was 
compared to TachoComb H (SR5130; corresponding histopathology report SR5130a). In this study, the skull 
as well as the dura mater were opened and 6 cortical brain wounds were created in each animal. The wounds 
were treated with the test items and the bleeding time was measured. After hemostasis was achieved, 
arterial hypertension was induced and wounds were observed for rebleeding. Animals were necropsied 3 and 
7 days after treatment. 
Hemostasis was achieved with TachoSil and TachoComb H significantly faster (p<0.001) than in controls; 
there was no difference in bleeding times between the 2 products. Both TachoSil and TachoComb H 
prevented rebleeding during severely increased arterial pressure. 
High-resolution magnetic resonance images showed similar edema formation in all animals. Histology 
revealed that TachoSil and TachoComb H did not induce any specific morphological changes in the brain 
tissue. Comparison of the histological findings in the animals sacrificed on Day 3 and Day 7 showed evidence 
of degradation of the fleece, as the mean level of degradation increased from 1 to 1.3 (0=absent; 1=slight; 
2=moderate; 3=marked; 4=severe). The lysis of the fibrin clot was not further described. No adhesions with 
the surrounding tissues were reported. 
TachoSil did not induce any specific histological or neuroradiological changes in rabbit brain tissue following 
3 and 7 days of implantation. 
The non-clinical data are rather limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in 
neurosurgical procedures and the potential for adhesions. However, data from the clinical studies, in which 
subjects were followed up for 6 months, did not reveal any issues in regard to neurotoxicity. 
TachoSil undergoes biodegradation by (1) phagocytosis and infiltration of granulation tissue and (2) 
degradation of the fibrin clot by endogenous fibrinolysis. The biodegradation of TachoSil was investigated 
macroscopically and microscopically in minipigs.  
In a study in female Goettingen minipigs, the biodegradation of TachoSil was compared to that of 
TachoComb H after application onto a defined liver and spleen lesion (study SR28/2008). Small remnants 
were observed 3 months after administration of either TachoSil or TachoComb H.  
A further single dose study (SR R-CP1363) investigated the toxicity and biodegradation of TachoSil in 
minipigs over 12 months following application to liver wounds. The use of TachoSil had no effect on local and 
systemic safety over 12 months. Complete degradation of TachoSil was seen in some animals 12 months 
after its administration to a liver wound, whereas small remnants were still observed in others. 
Safety pharmacologic aspects for TachoSil are based on the results obtained from nonclinical studies with 
TachoSil and its predecessor products. 
As the active constituents of TachoSil, ie, human fibrinogen and human thrombin are well established in 
clinical use, formal studies addressing clinical pharmacology are not applicable. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The mechanism of action of TachoSil follows the principles of physiological fibrin clot formation. Upon contact 
with a bleeding or leaking wound surface or by the presence of physiological saline, the coating of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/216119/2016 
Page 7/46 
 
  
  
 
collagen patch dissolves and the subsequent thrombin-fibrinogen reaction initiates the last step of the 
coagulation cascade: Fibrinogen is converted by the action of thrombin into fibrin monomers which 
spontaneously polymerize to a fibrin clot. Subsequently endogenous factor XIII, activated by thrombin, 
covalently cross links the fibrin to create a firm and stable network.  
Pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacologic aspects for TachoSil are based on the results obtained from 
non-clinical studies with TachoSil and its predecessor products. 
TachoSil is for epilesional use only and thus pharmacokinetic investigations do not apply. 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Currently available non-clinical data are adequate to support use of TachoSil in the extension of the 
indication for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following 
neurological surgery.

2.4.1.  Main study(ies) 
Study TC-2402-038-SP (TASALL - TachoSil® Against Liquor Leak) 
TachoSil versus current practice in dura sealing techniques for the prevention of post-operative 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks in patients undergoing skull base surgery: An open-label, randomised, 
controlled, multi-centre, parallel-group efficacy and safety trial. 
Methods 
This was an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 (therapeutic 
confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. 
Patients were evaluated for pre-operative eligibility at the Screening visit up to 5 days before randomisation. 
Final eligibility (randomisation) of patients was dependent on the fulfilment of intra-operative eligibility 
criteria. 
During surgery, immediately prior to application of primary dura closing techniques (primary suture of the 
dura, duraplasty, or both), eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either TachoSil or 
current practice. The randomised trial treatment was applied intra-operatively and dosing of randomised 
trial treatment (quantity, size of patch, amount [e.g. mL]) was according to the choice of technique and the 
size of the dura opening. TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a 
single layer or a sandwich (double layer), and was not removed after application. If used the sandwich 
technique the first layer of TachoSil was applied on the inside of the dura. The primary suture of the dura or 
duraplasty was then performed prior to the second application of TachoSil. The second layer of TachoSil was 
applied on the outside of the dura. 
In case of insufficient dura sealing after the first application of TachoSil (both for single layer and for the 
second TachoSil application in sandwich application), a second application of TachoSil could have been 
applied on top of the first application on the outside of the dura. 
The sealing efficacy was evaluated post-operatively as clinically evident CSF leaks and clinically evident and 
non-clinically evident pseudomeningoceles. Sealing efficacy was collected post-operatively until the Efficacy 
Follow-up (Week 7 ± 1 week). Non-clinically evident pseudomeningoceles were evaluated by computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed prior to surgery (up to 4 months) 
and any day prior to discharge and according to local practice from Day of Discharge until Safety Follow-up 
(Week 28 ± 2 weeks). 
Assessment report  
EMA/216119/2016 
Page 9/46 
 
  
  
 
 
  
Safety data were collected from when the patient signed the Informed Consent Form until the Safety 
Follow-up (Week 28 ± 2 weeks). Any visits to out-patient physicians (e.g. General Practitioners, specialists, 
physiotherapists), hospital staff and hospitals were documented on the Patient Card with which the patient 
was provided at the time of informed consent, thus empowering the trial staff to investigate and 
classify/document relevant events appropriately. 
The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Glasgow Coma 
Scale (GCS) patient assessments were conducted at Screening, Day 2, Day of Discharge, Efficacy Follow-up 
and Safety Follow-up. Home readiness was assessed daily from Day 4 until Day of Discharge from the 
surgical ward. 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board was set-up to monitor the safety data during the conduct of 
the trial. The trial was not to be stopped prematurely based on efficacy reasons.  
Study participants 
•  Study participants  
The study population consisted of subjects undergoing elective skull base surgery. A total of 778 subjects 
were enrolled in the study at 35 sites across 10 countries. Of these 778 subjects, a total of 726 subjects were 
randomly assigned to trial treatment, with 361 and 365 subjects randomized to TachoSil and Current 
Practice group, respectively.

Approach to the anterior fossa: subfrontal (uni or bilateral) 
Approach to the midline posterior fossa 
Pre-Operative Exclusion Criteria 
1. The patient had evidence of an infection within 5 days of surgery indicated by any one of the following: 
fever >101ºF/38.5°C, white blood cells (WBC) <3.5/GL or >13.0/GL (if patient was on steroid treatment 
>20.00/GL), positive urine culture, positive blood culture, positive chest X-ray 
2. The patient had a known coagulopathy 
3. A history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen, human thrombin and/or collagen of 
any origin 
4. The patient had been subject to neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater within the last 3 
months before Screening 
5. The patient was anticipated to undergo any additional neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater 
that may have affected the efficacy evaluation (e.g. re-operation or anticipation to undergo several 
neurosurgeries) before the Efficacy Follow-Up (Week 7 ± 1 week) 
6. The patient was anticipated to undergo any additional neurosurgery involving opening of the dura mater 
that may have affected the safety evaluation (e.g. re-operation or anticipation to undergo several 
neurosurgeries) before the Safety Follow-up (Week 28 ± 2 weeks) 
Intra-Operative Exclusion Criteria 
7. The surgical approach/procedure was consistent with any transcranial or transfacial or combination of 
transcranial – transfacial approaches with wide defect in the skull base, i.e. any of the following:

a) Translabyrinthine approach 
b) Retrolabyrinthine approach 
c) Transcochlear (limited transpetrosal) approach 
9. The arachnoid membrane and the CSF containing system remained intact during surgery 
10. The patient had more than 1 dura opening (not including dura openings from extraventricular or lumbar 
drains) 
11. TachoSil, fibrin or polymer sealants had been used during the current surgery prior to randomisation 
Treatments 
TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a single layer or a sandwich 
(double layer).To avoid selection bias random allocation was performed prior to application of primary dura 
closing techniques. Reason for this decision was to allow the sandwich technique.  
This study allowed the treating surgeon to apply a number of standard dura closing techniques alone or in 
combination. Non-investigational medicinal products included all trial treatments with medicinal products or 
medical devices utilised by the individual surgeon to seal the dura, including fibrin sealants, polymer 
sealants and any artificial dura substitutes. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To demonstrate superiority of TachoSil compared to current practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. 
Secondary Objective 
To evaluate the safety of TachoSil as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, a clinically 
evident pseudomeningocele, or study treatment failure defined as an event that occurred no later than 8 
weeks after surgery. The primary endpoint was considered to have been reached if a clinically evident 
verified CSF leak or clinically evident pseudomeningocele had occurred post-operatively until Efficacy 
Follow-up (Week 7 ± 1 week), or if trial treatment failure had occurred upon dura closure. 
Verification of CSF leaks was to be done by performing a glucose (glucose level of CSF is one-third lower than 
in serum), alternatively a β-2 transferrin test.  
The secondary endpoint was defined as the presence of nonclinically evident pseudomeningocele, ie, CSF 
accumulation found by CT or MRI scanning, postoperatively until Day of Discharge without occurrence of the 
primary endpoint. 
The occurrence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks or a clinically evident 
pseudomeningocele chosen as part of the primary endpoint are generally considered adequate to allow an 
assessment of the efficacy of the dura sealing.

Sample size 
Anticipating a control group leak rate of 17%, a TachoSil group leak rate of 8.5% and a drop-out rate of 5% 
and a type I error of 0.05 (2-sided) it was calculated that an asymptotic chi-square test with 726 patients 
(363 per group) would provide 90% power to detect such a response difference. 
Based on the assumptions made, the trial was sufficiently powered. However, the discrepancy between the 
anticipated leak rate in the control group (according protocol: based on feedback from neurosurgeons) and 
the observed leak rate in the trial is astonishing. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in an 1:1 (TachoSil : current practice) ratio by means of an Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS) or Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Permuted block randomisation (with 
varying block length) was applied. 
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was planned as an open label trial. 
Statistical methods 
In general data were summarised by means of descriptive statistics (continuous data: number of patients, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, lower quartile (25%), upper quartile (75%), minimum and 
maximum; categorical data: absolute and relative frequencies). Treatment effects were described by means 
of point estimates (e.g. odds ratio, difference of proportions) including their 95% confidence intervals. To 
describe time to event data, Kaplan-Meier plots were used.   
A logistic regression model (factors treatment and pooled centre) was used to compare both treatment 
groups with regard to the primary endpoint (occurrence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF 
leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or trial treatment failure up to the efficacy follow-up visit (week 
7±1)). The null-hypothesis of no treatment effect was to be rejected in case of a (2-sided) p-value < 0.05. 
The primary analysis was based on the Full Analysis Set of all randomized subjects. This analysis was 
replicated for the Per Protocol Population. Graphical methods were applied to assess the homogeneity of 
treatment effects across centres.   
Missing primary endpoint values were in general accounted for as non-leaks: It was assumed that an event 
of the primary endpoint was likely to prompt the patient to contact the investigator. If a patient died after 
randomisation and before the efficacy follow-up visit (week 7±1) and death could be definitively explained 
by reasons other than the indication then this was also defined as a non-leak.   
To assess the impact of missing value on the primary analysis the following approaches were used in 
addition:  
1. 
2. 
All drop outs counted as leaks  
50% of drop outs counted as leaks, i.e. 50% of the patients who dropped out were randomly 
assigned counting as a leak and 50% were assigned counting as a non-leak (stratified by treatment group). 
3. 
Assuming identical leak rates for drop outs and completers, i.e. patients who dropped out were 
randomly assigned as counting to be a leak or not a leak using this rate (stratified by treatment group). 
Additional analyses were performed to assess the impact of potentially predictive variables on the primary 
outcome, to compare TachoSil to each of 2 current practice subgroups (fibrin and polymer sealants and 
other methods of dura closure) and to assess the treatment effect across surgical approaches (i.e. 
interaction between surgical approaches and treatment group) was analysed  
Assessment report  
EMA/216119/2016 
Page 13/46 
 
  
  
The same approach as for the primary endpoint was applied to analyse the secondary endpoint (presence of 
non-clinically evident pseudomeningocele post-operatively until day of discharge without occurrence of the 
primary endpoint). 
Only the primary endpoint was to be tested in a confirmatory manner. Thus no multiplicity adjustment was 
necessary. 
All treatment emergent AEs (TEAE) were summarised by providing the number of patients, the proportion of 
patients with an event, and the number of events, using preferred term (PT) grouped by system organ class 
(SOC). In addition TEAEs were summarised by seriousness, severity and relationship to trial treatment and 
trial procedure. 
Laboratory data were standardised to account for the differences between local laboratories by relocating 
each original, locally recorded value to the corresponding value on the chosen reference range. Absolute 
laboratory values and changes from baseline were summarised by parameter and visit.  
Vital signs data were summarised and presented by treatment group for each parameter and visit. 
In general the statistical methods applied are considered adequate.

The eligibility of subjects according to protocol-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria was evaluated prior to 
surgery. Discontinuations at Baseline (prior to randomization) are expected to have affected both treatment 
arms equally, thus introducing no selection bias. No discontinuations occurred after randomization and prior 
to surgery. 
The reasons for discontinuation were varied and did not show any clear pattern.

Recruitment 
Studied Period: 28 April 2011 (first patient enrolled) to 27 June 2013 (last patient completed) 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol (dated 27 July 2009) was amended as follows: Substantial Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
and 6: dated 21 September 2009, 14 October 2010, 16 November 2010, 25 November 2011 (Version 2.0), 
25 November 2011 and 19 October 2012, respectively. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were updated 
during the trial 
A large number of substantial amendments were made to the protocol during the course of the study. Most 
were not likely to have introduced significant variability into the study, and were made to clarify the protocol. 
Limited transpetrosal surgical approaches (translabyrinthine, retrolabyrinthine, transcochlear) were 
specifically excluded in amendment 4. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of the patients was 53.1 years (range 18-87 years). The majority of patients were white or 
Caucasian (98.6%) and the most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic and non-Latino (80.4%). A higher 
proportion of male patients was randomly assigned to the Current Practice group (42.2%) than to the 
TachoSil group (35.5%) – see table

The mean age of the patients was 53.1 years (range 18-87 years). The majority of patients were white or 
Caucasian (98.6%) and the most common ethnicity was non-Hispanic and non-Latino (80.4%). 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment groups based on evaluation of 
demography, medical history, concomitant illness, concomitant medication, leak rate predictive variables, 
surgery times and intra-operative variables. 
The proportion of females in the study was substantially larger than that of males: 444 (61.2%) of the 726 
enrolled subjects were female (TC-2402-038-SP CSR Table 14.1.3.1). Females represented 64.5% of the 
TachoSil arm and 57.8% of the Current Practice arm. This preponderance is largely due to the fact that the 
most common primary indication for surgery was benign meningioma (CSR Appendix 16.2, Listing 
16.2.4.1.2), which occurs more frequently in females. Benign meningioma was identified as the primary 
indication in 130 female subjects (17.9% of the 726 enrolled) and 47 male subjects (6.5%). The next largest 
gender imbalance was seen in intracranial aneurysm, which represented the primary indication in 66 female 
(9.1%) and 19 male subjects (2.6%). 
Baseline variables considered predictive of leak rate are summarised below.

If duraplasty was applied alone it was counted as missing. 
Surgery times (skin incision to randomisation time, time from randomisation time to dura closure start, dura 
closure start to dura closure completion time, dura closure completion time to skin closure time and time 
from skin incision to skin closure) were similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
Intra-operative variables (dura incision length, dura incision shape, side of surgery, closure of skull and 
cranioplasty type) were generally similar across both treatment groups. 
For the primary suture, the proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the 
TachoSil group (63.2%) than in the Current Practice group (45.5%). The proportion of patients for whom 
suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group (35.7%) than in the Current Practice group 
(49.6%). Dura closure variables (dura application) were otherwise generally similar across both treatment 
groups. 
Post-operative variables were generally similar across both treatment groups. The mean (SD) length of stay 
as an in-patient in the original hospital was 11.0 (13.60) days in the TachoSil group (range 1-49 days) and 
16.2 (15.12) days in the Current Practice group (range 2-61 days). The proportion of patients who visited a 
General Practitioner or out-patient specialist, were re-admitted to hospital, or who had a surgical 
re-intervention were similar in the TachoSil and Current Practice groups. 
Only a small proportion (5%) of patients had received prior radiotherapy to the head within the past 5 years.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Variable  
Table 5    Analysis of Incidence of Clinically Evident Verified Post-Operative CSF Leaks, Clinically Evident 
Pseudomeningocele or Treatment Failure at Efficacy Follow-up (FAS) 
A total of 6.9% (25/361) of subjects in the TachoSil group and 8.2% (30/365) of subjects in the Current 
Practice group (full analysis set [FAS]) had clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, clinically 
evident pseudomeningocele, or were treatment failures at efficacy follow-up. 
The primary analysis of the incidence of clinically evident verified post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident 
pseudomeningocele or treatment failure (FAS) showed an estimated OR of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.43, 
P=0.485). The proportion of patients in the TachoSil group without clinically evident verified post-operative 
CSF leaks, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure was therefore not superior to the 
Current Practice group for the FAS. A significant centre effect was found (P=0.046); this effect appeared to 
be driven by a higher leak rate in Russia. Care must be taken when interpreting the centre effect, however, 
Assessment report

given the small sample size of the Russian subgroup. Similar results were obtained when all CSF leaks 
(including non-verified leaks) were included in the analysis: 27 (7.5%) patients in the TachoSil group and 34 
(9.3%) patients in the Current Practice group had clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically 
evident pseudomeningocele or treatment failure (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.33, P=0.360); however, the 
centre effect was not statistically significant (P=0.066). 
The proportion of patients with clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident 
pseudomeningocele or treatment failure was analysed by demographic subgroup category for the FAS. For 
verified CSF leaks, the estimated OR was 0.43 for male patients and 1.38 for female patients, implying a 
greater likelihood of a female TachoSil patient experiencing a CSF leak (compared with a female Current 
Practice patient) and conversely a lower likelihood of a male TachoSil patient experiencing a CSF leak. The 
95% CIs for both OR estimates included 1 and no statistically significant difference between treatments 
could be concluded for either gender. (summarised in Section 14, Table 14.2.3.3 study report) 
The proportion of patients with incidence of clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, clinically evident 
pseudomeningocele or treatment failure by 2 Current Practice subgroups (fibrin and polymer sealants and 
other methods of dura closure): For the analysis of the primary endpoint by Current Practice subgroup, the 
estimated OR for the Fibrin and Polymer Sealant subgroup compared with TachoSil was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.4, 
2.0, P=0.820). For the Other Dura Closure Methods subgroup compared with TachoSil, the estimated OR 
was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.8, P=0.241). 
Of the 87 patients in the Current Practice group who had suturing alone, 8 (9.2%) patients had clinically 
evident post-operative CSF leaks, pseudomeningocele or treatment failure. Of the 361 patients in the 
TachoSil group, 25 (6.9%) had clinically evident post-operative CSF leaks, pseudomeningocele or treatment 
failure. The estimated OR for suturing alone compared with TachoSil was 1.29 (95% CI: 0.6, 3.0, P=0.559). 
Secondary Efficacy Variable  
The primary analysis of the incidence of non-clinically evident post-operative pseudomeningocele (FAS) 
showed an estimated OR of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.43, 2.36, P=0.979). No difference between the TachoSil and 
Current Practice groups could be concluded.

In the TachoSil arm of study TC-2402-038-SP, 1 of the 11 nonclinically evident postoperative 
pseudomeningoceles reported as a secondary efficacy measure occurred in the postdischarge period. The 
remaining 10 occurred before discharge. In the Current Practice arm, 2 of the 11 nonclinically evident 
postoperative pseudomeningoceles occurred in the postdischarge period, and 9 occurred before discharge. 
In the TachoSil arm, 26 scans were conducted in the post-discharge period. The time range of the scans 
(between 2 to 250 days after discharge) showed no particular trend. Only 1 of the 26 scans was positive for 
non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles. One subject had 2 scans at different times and 
both were negative. Another subject with positive pre-discharge scan findings on Day 8 remained positive 
for non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles on a repeat scan on post-discharge Day 98. 
In the Current Practice arm, 27 scans were conducted in the post-discharge period. The time range of the 
scans was 1 to 179 days after discharge and showed no particular trend. Four of the 27 scans were positive 
for non-clinically evident postoperative pseudomeningoceles. 
Exploratory Analyses 
A total of 34 (9.4%) subjects in the TachoSil group and 38 (10.4%) subjects in the Current Practice group 
(FAS) had either the primary endpoint or nonclinically evident pseudomeningocele. The exploratory analysis 
of the combined endpoint (FAS) showed an estimated OR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.44, p=0.609). 
For the analysis of the primary endpoint by Current Practice subgroup, the estimated OR for the Fibrin and 
Polymer Sealant subgroup compared with TachoSil was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.0, p=0.820). For the Other 
Dura Closure Methods subgroup compared with TachoSil, the estimated OR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.8, 2.8, 
p=0.241).

For the primary suture, the proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the 
TachoSil group (63.2%) than in the Current Practice group (45.5%). The proportion of patients for whom 
suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group (35.7%) than in the Current Practice group 
(49.6%). Dura closure variables (dura application) were otherwise generally similar across both treatment 
groups. 
A subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint by TachoSil application type (sandwich or single layer) is shown 
in Table 8. The odds ratio values do not provide support for use of the double-layer (sandwich) technique.

The first analysis of the primary endpoint only includes the verified leaks. However, including the 
non-verified leaks does not change the picture of a very low number of events in both treatment groups. 
The company had expected an event rate of 5-6% in the TachoSil group, however they had assumed a much 
higher (15-20%) event rate in the current practice group than found in this study.

The proportion of patients for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group than the 
Current Practice group whereas the proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was 
lower in the TachoSil group than in the Current Practice group. It was discussed that the current practise 
group was too broad and probably the dura closure was more thorough than in a normal clinical setting. But 
this isn’t verified and it can be supposed that if a surgeon carefully performs the dura closure such results 
would be obtained. 
According to the subgroup analysis provided in Table 7 there is no statistically significant difference between 
the TachoSil and Current Practice groups for any surgical approach.  
A total of 8.2 % (30/365) of subjects in the Current Practice group and 6.9% (25/361) of subjects in the 
TachoSil group had clinically evident, verified postoperative CSF leaks, clinically evident 
pseudomeningocele, or were treatment failures at efficacy follow-up. 
The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed an estimated OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.51, 2.24, 
P=0.855) for TachoSil sandwich and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.25, P=0.1845) for TachoSil single-layer.  
Therefore, the proportion of patients treated with double-layer technique was therefore not superior to the 
the single-layer group. 
The use of rescue treatment was very low in both treatment groups (5 [1.4%] patients in each group).

Notes 
In line with the primary analysis, none of the additionally performed 
analyses indicated a superiority of TachoSil when compared to current 
practice. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The company performed a meta-analysis using high-level data from the Hutter (2014) trial. According to the 
documents results from "suture alone" from the TASALL trial and the Hutter trial were pooled. 
The primary dural closure in the TASALL and Hutter [10] studies was defined as primary suture of the dural 
membrane and/or duraplasty with a dural patch, hence the techniques were the same. “Dural patch” is a 
general term used to describe the various types of materials used for duraplasty in the primary closure. 
“Dural patch” should not be confused with medicinal product like some sealants or TachoSil. The technique 
of duraplasty in all cases involves suturing to attach the dural patch to the edges of the residual dural 
membrane. The dural patch materials used in the TASALL and Hutter [10] studies were the same. They 
included autologous tissue (galea, muscle, pericranium) or an artificial membrane material. 
Accordingly, the primary treatments consisting of suturing and duraplasty to close the dura were the same 
in the 2 studies. 
The secondary, randomized treatment in control subjects in the Hutter study was suture [10]. This is 
comparable to the treatment in the subgroup of subjects receiving suturing alone in the TASALL study. Since 
the primary endpoint was the same in both studies (discussed in Response to the 2nd RSI; sequence 0066), 
it is therefore justified and appropriate to combine the 2 studies in a meta-analysis comparing TachoSil 
treatment with suturing alone across the 2 studies. The objective of the meta-analysis was to increase the 
statistical power. The similarity of the subject populations, procedures, and efficacy endpoints in both the 
studies ensured a robust meta-analysis. The result of the meta-analysis showed statistical superiority of 
TachoSil, with a leak event rate reduction of -5.6 percentage points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%; p=0.035) 
over suturing, corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The purpose of this application was to present data in support of the efficacy of TachoSil for supportive 
sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery 
based on the results obtained from neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study TC-2402-038-SP was designed as an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, 
phase 3 (therapeutic confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in 
sealing the dura mater.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate to generate an adequate patient population. Only adult 
patients were included in the pivotal study in neurosurgery.  Just under half of the patients were enrolled 
using the selection criteria from an earlier version of the protocol, which differed in regard to a smaller 
number of allowed surgical approaches. However, this is not considered to have had a major impact on the 
results of the study.

The randomization procedure was comprehensible and sufficiently described. It is agreed, based on the 
differences in the applied treatment modalities (patch versus ‘current practice’) applied to the dura mater 
during surgery - that use of placebo or blinding is practically impossible. It was planned to show a difference 
in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a 
fixed sample size of 726 patients. 362 patients were randomised to treatment with TachoSil, which was 
applied over the suture line in a single layer, or as a double sandwich layer, inside and outside of the dura, 
where a sufficient overlap of the suture line was not possible with a single layer application. 364 control 
patients were randomised to best standard of care, at the discretion of the Investigator (eg, duraplasty, 
fibrin/polymer sealant, sutures alone, etc.). The use of a broad range of standard of care treatments in the 
control group was appropriate since there is no gold standard treatment, and since there were ethical 
concerns with restricting control subjects to sutures alone when CSF leakage has been shown to occur in 
almost 20% of cases. Together with this, the eligibility criteria were broad, and included those with previous 
local radiotherapy, which may predispose to CSF leakage.  
There was no specified reference product in this clinical trial. The control treatment in the trial is defined as 
current practice, which is primary suture and in addition whatever means of dura closure is deemed 
necessary by the investigator (except of TachoSil treatment). This is noted, since there is no defined gold 
standard and in current clinical practice several alternatives are applied, e.g. fibrin glue, hydrogel, dura 
substitute. However, as requested by the ‘European guideline on the clinical investigation of plasma derived 
fibrin sealant/haemostatic products’ (CPMP/BPWG/1089/00), the efficacy of fibrin sealant should be 
investigated in comparison  to standard treatment without fibrin sealant to allow for demonstration of 
haemostatic properties and clinical benefit of the investigational medicinal product. 
To avoid selection bias random allocation was performed prior to application of primary dura closing 
techniques. Reason for this decision was to allow the sandwich technique.   
Only adult patients were included in the pivotal study in neurosurgery. The occurrence of clinically evident 
verified post-operative CSF leaks or a clinically evident pseudomeningocele chosen as part of the primary 
endpoint are considered adequate to allow an assessment of the efficacy of the dura sealing. 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 2 treatment groups based on evaluation of 
demography, medical history, concomitant illness, concomitant medication, leak rate predictive variables, 
surgery times and intra-operative variables. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results for the primary analysis show that approximately 7% of TachoSil subjects experienced a CSF 
leak, a pseudomeningocele, or treatment failure during surgery, compared with 8% of control patients. 
Although the point estimate of the odds of failure in dural sealing was 0.82 compared with current practice 
(over half of whom received an adjunctive sealing technique), the confidence interval was wide (0.47 to 
1.43).  The sensitivity analyses for different methods of handling missing data do not change the conclusions 
from the primary analysis. Regarding the secondary endpoint, non-clinically evident post-operative 
pseudomeningocele occurred in 3% of subjects in each treatment group, giving an odds ratio of 1.01 (0.43, 
2.28). 
The results of the additional comparisons of TachoSil treatment and a number of treatment modalities in the 
Current Practice treatment arm showed that TachoSil prevented more postoperative leak events than any of 
the subgroups. Values for the reduction in postoperative leak events ranged from 1.53 to 4.75 percentage 
points at postoperative Week 7 and from 3.12 to 5.35 percentage points at Week 28, corresponding to 
clinically relevant relative reductions of 20% to 44% and 34% to 47%, respectively. All of these comparisons 
support the use of TachoSil in neurosurgery to prevent CSF leaks.

For the largest subgroup (Current Practice excluding suturing alone) in the post-hoc analysis, superiority of 
TachoSil was demonstrated with statistical significance at Week 28 (p=0.050). 
In order to increase the statistical power, a meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by 
Hutter et al was done and carefully discussed. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with 
suturing alone showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage 
points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%. 
Study TC-2402-038-SP was planned to show a difference in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between 
TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a fixed sample size of 726 patients.  
In the Current Practice group, a total of 87 (23.8%) patients received suture alone/suture, 171 (46.8%) 
patients received sealant and 156 (42.7%) patients received duraplasty. 
In the TachoSil group, a total of 241 (66.8%) patients received single layer treatment and 113 (31.3%) 
patients received sandwich treatment for the first application of TachoSil. 
The proportion of patients without clinically evident CSF leak, clinically evident pseudomeningocele or 
treatment failure in the TachoSil treatment group was not different from the Current Practice treatment 
group (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.47, 1.43 for the FAS); therefore, TachoSil was not shown to be superior to 
current practice as an adjunct in sealing the dura mater. The results were supported by the Per-Protocol 
Analysis Set and sensitivity analyses. 
The first analysis of the primary endpoint only includes the verified leaks. However, including the 
non-verified leaks does not change the picture of a very low number of events in both treatment groups. 
Furthermore, the company has presented an additional post hoc analysis which is not based on the original 
primary endpoint because the MAH has considered any CSF leak is clinically relevant. This method has to be 
taken into consideration when interpreting this subgroup analysis.  The results of this further analysis are 
not statistically significant except one of twelve subgroup analysis (CP excluding suturing alone). At least, it 
can be evaluated as a positive signal for treatment efficacy. Moreover, the MAH refers to a clinically relevant 
relative reduction in all subgroups. But these data are presented without a confidence interval which might 
a hint to non-significant results. This can only be considered as a positive signal, too. Therefore, Efficacy was 
not conclusively demonstrated in the TASALL trial. 
The company had expected an event rate of 5-6% in the TachoSil group; however they had assumed a much 
higher (15-20%) event rate in the current practice group than found in this study. The proportion of patients 
for whom only sutures were used was higher in the TachoSil group than the Current Practice group whereas 
the proportion of patients for whom suture and duraplasty were used was lower in the TachoSil group than 
in the Current Practice group. It was discussed that the current practise group was too broad and probably 
the dura closure was more thorough than in a normal clinical setting. The MAH believes that the main reason 
for the statistically nonsignificant result is the overestimation of the expected postoperative CSF leak rate. 
It is accepted that a number of factors leading to a lower event rate in the standard of care arm may have 
contributed to this, including the use of another supportive method in addition to suturing in a high 
proportion of patients in the current practice arm. The results in the subgroup of subjects with a gap ≥5 mm 
(all leak events, TachoSil single layer only) showed a leak event rate of 0% in TachoSil-treated subjects vs 
19.4% in control-treated subjects at Weeks 7 and 28. But these are even more nonsignificant results. 
Nevertheless the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed. 
The proportion of patients with non-clinically evident pseudomeningocele was not found to be different in the 
TachoSil group in comparison with the Current Practice group (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.43, 2.36 for the FAS). 
Moreover, results of subgroup analysis couldn’t show statistically significant difference between the TachoSil 
and Current Practice groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216119/2016 
Page 28/46 
 
  
  
TachoSil was applied during surgery as an adjunct to the closure of the dura, as a single layer or a sandwich 
(double layer).  The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint showed an estimated OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 
0.51, 2.24, P=0.855) for TachoSil sandwich and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.32, 1.25, P=0.1845) for TachoSil 
single-layer.  
Therefore, the proportion of patients treated with double-layer technique was therefore not superior to the 
single-layer group and is no longer part of this variation, because treatment effect could not been 
demonstrated. 
The use of rescue treatment was very low in both treatment groups (5 [1.4%] patients in each group). 
A meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by Hutter et al was done and discussed at an 
Oral Explanation with the CHMP. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with suturing alone 
showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage points (95% CI, 
-11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%. 
In accordance with its design the TASALL study failed to demonstrate superiority of TachoSil over current 
clinical practice in the claimed indication extension. Despite the failure to demonstrate superiority against 
control, the argument that the standard of care employed in the study produced a higher than expected 
success rate. It is acknowledged that the results numerically are in favour for TachoSil and when compared 
against subgroups, the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed. Finally, the previously presented 
meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the Hutter study showed statistical superiority over suturing alone. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An overall trend in favour of TachoSil when compared against subgroups, is observed in the TASALL study 
and supported by the presented meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published Hutter study showing 
statistical superiority over suturing alone. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
More recent safety data continue to support the clinical use of TachoSil. Since the approval of TachoSil in the 
European Union, an estimated number of 3,600,000 patients have been exposed to TachoSil until 08 June 
2013 under the assumption of an average use of 1 patch for each surgical procedure. Up to 08 June 2013, 
a total of 261 spontaneously reported ADRs were recorded. A total of 184 ADRs were considered to be 
serious and 77 were non-serious. 
The safety of TachoSil for suture line sealing in dura mater closure is based on the results obtained from 
neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP. 
Patient exposure 
In the present study TC-2402-038-SP to support the neurosurgical indication applied for, a total of 726 
subjects were randomized to treatment, thereof 362 to TachoSil and 364 to control. 
61% of patients required 0.25-1 patches, 33% required .125-2 patches, 4% required 2.25-3 patches, and 
2% required 3.25-4 patches. In the TachoSil group, a total of 241 (66.8%) patients received single layer 
treatment and 113 (31.3%) patients received sandwich treatment for the first application of TachoSil.

Adverse events 
Table 9   Summary of Adverse Events (SAF) 
Adverse events were reported for 250 (69.1%) patients in the TachoSil group and 250 (68.7%) patients in 
the Current Practice group. The majority of AEs in each treatment group were considered by the Investigator 
to be not related to trial treatment or trial procedure. In the TachoSil group, AEs considered by the 
Investigator to be related to trial treatment were reported for 5 (1.4%) patients. 
The types and frequencies of AEs were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. Adverse events were 
most frequently reported in the nervous system disorders SOC in both treatment groups (152 [42.0%] 
patients in the TachoSil group and 149 [40.9%] patients in the Current Practice group). The most frequently 
reported AEs by PT for patients in the TachoSil group were constipation (24 [6.6%] patients), 
pneumocephalus (21 [5.8%] patients) and hypokalaemia (20 [5.5%] patients). The most frequently 
reported AEs by PT for patients in the Current Practice group were pneumocephalus (25 [6.9%] patients), 
pyrexia (24 [6.6%] patients) and hypokalaemia (23 [6.3%] patients). The majority of AEs were considered 
by the Investigator to be unrelated to trial treatment. 
The proportion of patients with severe AEs was similar in the 2 treatment groups, occurring in 80 (22.1%) 
patients in the TachoSil group and 80 (22.0%) patients in the Current Practice group. The severe AE PTs 
most frequently reported for patients in the TachoSil group were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] patients), VIIth 
nerve paralysis (6 [1.7%] patients) and pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients). The severe AE PTs most frequently 
reported for patients in the Current Practice group were sepsis (6 [1.6% patients]) and hydrocephalus and 
pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients each). 
The proportion of patients with serious AEs (SAEs) (excluding those that led to death) was similar in the 2 
treatment groups. In the TachoSil group the most frequently reported were hydrocephalus (10 [2.8%] 
patients) and meningitis (5 [1.4%] patients). In the Current Practice group the most frequently reported 
were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] patients) and pneumonia (6 [1.6%] patients). The proportion of patients with

SAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment: 3 (0.8%) patients in the TachoSil group 
and no patient in the Current Practice group.

In the TachoSil group, overall nine AEs have been considered by the Investigator to be related to trial 
treatment. The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE considered by the Investigator to be related to trial 
treatment was low (n=5, 1.4 %). Apart from air embolism, all AEs (i.e. Infections, Nervous system 
disorders) are considered to be consequences of the surgical procedure and/or the underlying disease. There 
were no treatment-related AEs reported for patients in the Current Practice group.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Adverse events leading to death were reported for 19 (5.2%) patients in the TachoSil group and 24 (6.6%) 
patients in the Current Practice group. No AEs leading to death were considered by the Investigator to be 
related to trial treatment. The AEs leading to death reported for more than 1 patient in the TachoSil group 
were cardio-respiratory arrest, pneumonia, neoplasm progression and cerebral ischaemia (2 [0.6%] 
patients each). AE leading to death reported for more than 1 patient in the Current Practice group was sepsis 
(2 [0.5%] patients). 
Serious AEs were reported for 94 (26%) patients in the TachoSil group and 97 (26.6%) patients in the 
Current Practice group. 
In the TachoSil group, SAEs considered to be related to trial treatment were reported for 3 (0.8%) patients. 
No patients in the Current Practice group experienced SAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be 
related to trial treatment.

The majority of SAEs were severe. The proportion of patients with severe SAEs was similar in the 2 
treatment groups (63 [17.4%] patients in the TachoSil group and 72 [19.8%] patients in the Current 
Practice group). Severe SAEs were most frequently reported in the nervous system disorders SOC in both 
treatment groups (35 [9.7%] patients in the TachoSil group and 34 [9.3%] patients in the Current Practice 
group). The severe SAE PTs most frequently reported in the TachoSil group were hydrocephalus (8 [2.2%] 
patients) and pneumonia (5 [1.4%] patients). The severe SAE PTs most frequently reported in the Current 
Practice group were hydrocephalus, pneumonia and sepsis (5 [1.4%] patients each). 
No AE leading to death was considered by the Investigator to be related to trial treatment. The AEs leading 
to death were assessed by the sponsor to be due to post-operative complications or the patient’s underlying 
disease or general condition. 
It is agreed that serious adverse events as observed in the trial might be related to surgical complications 
and underlying medical conditions. 
Laboratory findings 
As expected due to the nature of the underlying disease in this patient population, several patients in each 
treatment group had clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results at certain visits and several 
patients in each treatment group had AEs related to abnormal laboratory results. Similar proportions of 
patients in each treatment group experienced AEs in the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC, which 
comprised anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, leukopenia and neutropenia; none of these AEs were 
considered related to trial treatment. 
Mean vital sign results (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature) 
were similar across both treatment groups and there was little change from Baseline at each time point. 
Several patients in each treatment group had clinically significant abnormal vital sign results at certain visits 
and several patients in each treatment group had AEs related to abnormal vital sign results. Similar

proportions of patients in each treatment group experienced AEs of hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia 
and bradycardia; none of these AEs were considered related to trial treatment. 
Clinical laboratory results were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. 
Post marketing experience 
The most recent PSUR was submitted to the PRAC on 11 September 2014, and covered the period June 2011 
to June 2014. The Rapporteur preliminary assessment report was circulated on 10 November 2014, and the 
final PRAC assessment report is expected on 8 January 2015. The preliminary conclusion of the PRAC 
Rapporteur was that no new safety information had arisen during the reporting period which would change 
the benefit-risk balance for TachoSil. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data obtained from the clinical trial with TC-S indicate no concerns for the safety profile of TC-S when 
used in neurosurgery to support suture line sealing in dura mater closure. This assessment is supported by 
the data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoSil. 
In the present study 362 subjects were randomized to treatment with TachoSil and 364 to control. Both 
treatments were adjunctive to primary suture dura repair.  
The most frequent AEs were constipation, pneumocephalus and, which are all commonly associated with this 
type of surgery. Constipation was more frequently reported in the TachoSil group. 
It is agreed that serious adverse events as observed in the trial might be related to surgical complications 
and underlying medical conditions. No AE leading to death was considered by the Investigator to be related 
to trial treatment. The AEs leading to death were assessed by the sponsor to be due to post-operative 
complications or the patient’s underlying disease or general condition.  
It can be presumed that TachoSil provides a durable dura closure which lasts long enough to enable 
watertight closure until healing of the dura cut is completed since CSF leaks occur mostly within 30 days 
postoperatively according to the literature in neurosurgery. 
It is not known whether recent radiation therapy affects the efficacy of TachoSil when used for dura mater 
sealing. This statement has been added under section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, a previous statement on lack of data in neurosurgery is now revised following this submission.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
TachoSil was found to be well tolerated in the context of the surgical procedures performed, with no 
evidence of increased frequency of AEs compared with patients treated with current practice. The numbers 
of AEs and SAEs were equally distributed between treatment groups and the type/nature and level were as 
expected considering the surgery performed and the patient co-morbidities. 
The presented results are considered to be acceptable. There were no safety signals due to the use of 
TachoSil in neurosurgery procedures. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in 
rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/haemostatics. In 
isolated cases, these reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis. 
Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied 
repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive

4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of 
medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include 
selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection and the inclusion of effective 
manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite 
this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma

4.1 Therapeutic indications 
TachoSil is indicated in adults for supportive treatment in surgery for 
improvement of haemostasis, to promote tissue sealing, for suture 
support in vascular surgery where standard techniques are 
insufficient, and for supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent 
postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological surgery. 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric patients: TachoSil is not recommended for use in children 
below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

4.6 Pregnancy and lactation 
The safety of TachoSil for use in human pregnancy or breastfeeding 
has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Experimental 
animal studies are insufficient to assess the safety with respect to 
reproduction, development of the embryo or foetus, the course of 
gestation and peri- and postnatal development. Therefore, TachoSil 
should be administered to pregnant and lactating women only if 
clearly needed.

4.3 Contraindications 
None proposed.  
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients. 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
As with any protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions 
are possible. Signs of hypersensitivity reactions include hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension 
and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, the administration has to 
be discontinued immediately. 
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment 
should be observed. 
4.8 Undesirable effects Immune system disorders: 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include 
angioedema, burning and stinging at the application site, 
bronchospasm, chills, flushing, generalized urticaria, headache, 
hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, 
tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) may occur in 
rare cases in patients treated with fibrin sealants/ haemostatics. In 
isolated cases, these reactions may progress to severe anaphylaxis. 
Such reactions may especially be seen, if the preparation is applied 
repeatedly, or administered to patients known to be hypersensitive 
to constituents of the product. 
Investigations: 
Antibodies against components of fibrin sealant/ haemostatic 
products may occur rarely.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The study was designed as an open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, phase 3 
(therapeutic confirmatory) study comparing TachoSil versus Current Practice as an adjunct in sealing the 
dura mater. 
Study TC-2402-038-SP was planned to show a difference in CSF leak or pseudomeningocele rates between 
TachoSil (8.5%) and the control group (17.0%) with a fixed sample size of 726 patients. 362 patients were 
randomised to treatment with TachoSil, which was applied over the suture line in a single layer, or as a 
double sandwich layer, inside and outside of the dura, where a sufficient overlap of the suture line was not 
possible with a single layer application. 364 control patients were randomised to best standard of care, at the 
discretion of the Investigator (eg, duraplasty, fibrin/polymer sealant, sutures alone, etc.).  
The use of a broad range of standard of care treatments in the control group was appropriate since there is 
no gold standard treatment, and since there were ethical concerns with restricting control subjects to 
sutures alone when CSF leakage has been shown to occur in almost 20% of cases. Together with this, the 
eligibility criteria were broad, and included those with previous local radiotherapy, which may predispose to 
CSF leakage. The results for the primary analysis show that approximately 7% of TachoSil subjects 
experienced a CSF leak, a pseudomeningocele, or treatment failure during surgery, compared with 8% of 
control patients. Although the point estimate of the odds of failure in dural sealing was 0.82 compared with 
current practice (over half of whom received an adjunctive sealing technique), the confidence interval was 
wide (0.47 to 1.43).  The sensitivity analyses for different methods of handling missing data do not change 
the conclusions from the primary analysis. Regarding the secondary endpoint, non-clinically evident 
post-operative pseudomeningocele occurred in 3% of subjects in each treatment group, giving an odds ratio 
of 1.01 (0.43, 2.28). 
The results of the additional comparisons of TachoSil treatment and a number of treatment modalities in the 
Current Practice treatment arm showed that TachoSil prevented more postoperative leak events than any of 
the subgroups. Values for the reduction in postoperative leak events ranged from 1.53 to 4.75 percentage 
points at postoperative Week 7 and from 3.12 to 5.35 percentage points at Week 28, corresponding to 
clinically relevant relative reductions of 20% to 44% and 34% to 47%, respectively. All of these comparisons 
support the use of TachoSil in neurosurgery to prevent CSF leaks. 
For the largest subgroup (Current Practice excluding suturing alone) in the post-hoc analysis, superiority of 
TachoSil was demonstrated with statistical significance at Week 28 (p=0.050). 
Assessment report  
EMA/216119/2016 
Page 41/46 
 
  
  
In order to increase the statistical power, a meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the published study by 
Hutter et al was done and carefully discussed. This meta-analysis comparing TachoSil treatment with 
suturing alone showed statistical superiority of TachoSil with a reduction in leak rate of 5.6 percentage 
points (95% CI, -11.1%, -0.2%, p=0.035), corresponding to a clinically relevant relative reduction of 43%. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The non-clinical data are rather limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in 
neurosurgical procedures and the potential for adhesions. However, data from the clinical studies, in which 
subjects were followed up for 6 months, did not reveal any issues in regard to neurotoxicity. 
Methodological issues which led to the failure of the trial to prove superiority have been adequately 
explained. Further analyses into the data and meta-analysis the results of a published trial showed the 
efficacy of TachoSil in the final agreed indication. The result of the meta-analysis showed statistical 
superiority of TachoSil although neither the TASALL study nor the study by Hutter demonstrate a statistically 
significant treatment effect on their own.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The data obtained from the clinical trial with TC-S indicate no concerns for the safety profile of TC-S when 
used in neurosurgery to support suture line sealing in dura mater closure. This assessment is supported by 
the data from studies and postmarketing experience with TachoSil. 
The clinical safety of TachoSil for use in surgical haemostasis has been demonstrated in a range of clinical 
studies in lung, liver, kidney and cardiovascular surgery. In addition, there is a large amount of 
post-marketing experience for TachoSil in surgical procedures, and the most recent PSUR, covering June 
2011 to June 2014, has just been submitted. Only three adverse drug reactions are listed in the SmPC, 
pyrexia, hypersensitivity, and thromboembolism (if inadvertently applied intravascularly).  
The total number of postoperative complications was fewer in the TachoSil group than the Current 
Practice/Control group (5.2% and 6.3%), ie, meningitis, empyema, and hematomas and the TASALL study 
has shown a lower frequency for more serious interventions, ie, hospital readmission, surgical 
revision/reoperation due to leak events in the TachoSil group. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The non-clinical data are limited, especially in regard to the longer term effect of TachoSil in neurosurgical 
procedures and the potential for adhesions. Clinical research into the absorption of and potential tissue 
reactions to TachoSil in humans is limited due to ethical reasons, since it would involve repeat intervention 
with open or laparoscopic surgery for follow-up observation and/or to take a biopsy sample for histological 
examination.  
However no issues have been reported from the extensive post marketing experience so far.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
It is accepted that there is a need for watertight sealing of the dura mater after neurosurgical procedures, in 
order to prevent CSF leaks and consequent postoperative morbidity due to surgical site infections, 
meningitis, pneumocephalus and meningocerebral adhesions. Standard closure techniques, such as use of 
sutures only, have been associated with post-operative leakage in around a fifth of patients. Other 
techniques, such as grafting of fat, fascia, muscle, or use of fibrin/polymer sealant products have been 
shown effective in reducing the intra- and post-operative leakage rate. 
In the TASALL trial, although the leakage rate in treated patients was low (7%), the leakage rate in control 
patients, who could receive any available therapy at the discretion of the Investigator, and who may 
consequently have been over-treated, was also low (8%). The study therefore failed to demonstrate the 
superiority of TachoSil over current practice. But it is accepted that a number of factors leading to a lower 
event rate in the standard of care arm may have contributed to this, including the use of another supportive 
method in addition to suturing in a high proportion of patients in the current practice arm. The results for the 
analysis in the subgroup of subjects with a gap ≥5 mm showed a leak event rate of 0% in TachoSil-treated 
subjects vs 19.4% in control-treated subjects at Weeks 7 and 28. But these are even more nonsignificant 
results. Nevertheless the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is observed. 
In patients treated with the double-layer technique no treatment effect could be demonstrated. Therefore 
sandwich application is no longer part of this variation. 
The safety of TachoSil in neurosurgical procedures appears acceptable, and comparable with the known 
safety in other surgical procedures. There were no signals of specific events occurring disproportionately in 
treated patients compared with control patients.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the potential clinical benefit  for use in suture line sealing in dura mater closure where standard 
techniques are insufficient  are considered to outweigh any unfavourable effect and so the current 
benefit-risk balance of TachoSil in the claimed indication is considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The purpose of this application was to present data in support of the safety and efficacy of TachoSil for 
supportive sealing of the dura mater to prevent postoperative cerebrospinal leakage following neurological 
surgery based on the results obtained from neurosurgery Study TC-2402-038-SP. 
An incomplete sealing of the dura mater intraoperatively implies a risk of developing substantial 
postoperative complications such as a pseudomeningocele or worse: a fistula leading to postoperative 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage presenting as rhinorrhea, otorrhea and/or a CSF leak through the surgical 
skin incision.   
Considering efficacy, taking all data together, in accordance with its design the TASALL study failed to 
demonstrate superiority of TachoSil over current clinical practice in the claimed indication extension. Despite 
the failure to demonstrate superiority against control, as it appears that the standard of care employed in 
the study produced a higher than expected success rate. It is acknowledged that the results numerically are 
in favour for TachoSil and when compared against subgroups, the overall trend in favour of TachoSil is 
observed. Finally, the previously presented meta-analysis of data from TASALL and the Hutter study showed 
statistical superiority over suturing alone.

TachoSil was found to be well tolerated in the context of the surgical procedures performed, with no 
evidence of increased frequency of AEs compared with patients treated with current practice. The numbers 
of AEs and SAEs were equally distributed between treatment groups and the type/nature and level were as 
expected considering the surgery performed and the patient co-morbidities. 
Moreover, the study presented a lower frequency of postoperative complications of CSF leakage including 
meningitis, empyema and hematoma in the TachoSil group compared with the control groups. This overall 
trend of reduction of postoperative complications of CSF leaks is supported. Therefore, this data indicates a 
favourable effect for TachoSil in neurosurgery.  
Overall, the potential clinical benefit  for use in suture line sealing in dura mater closure where standard 
techniques are insufficient  are considered to outweigh any unfavourable effect and so the current 
benefit-risk balance of TachoSil in the claimed indication is considered to be positive.

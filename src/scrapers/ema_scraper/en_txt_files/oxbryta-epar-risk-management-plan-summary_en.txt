PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE EUROPEAN UNION RISK 
MANAGEMENT PLAN 
This is a summary of the European Union risk management plan (RMP) for Oxbryta. The RMP 
details important risks of Oxbryta, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about Oxbryta’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Oxbryta’s prescribing information and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Oxbryta should be used.   
I.  
The medicine and what it is used for 
Oxbryta is authorised for treatment of haemolytic anaemia due to sickle cell disease (SCD) in 
adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age or older (see Summary of Product Characteristics 
[SmPC] for the full indication). It contains voxelotor as the active substance and it is given by 
mouth. 
Further information about the evaluation of Oxbryta’s benefits can be found in Oxbryta’s 
European public assessment report (EPAR), including in its plain-language summary, available 
on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/oxbryta 
II.  
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Oxbryta, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Oxbryta’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
•  The authorised pack size—the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) assessment, so 
that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Oxbryta is not yet available, it is listed 
under “missing information” below.

II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Oxbryta are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Oxbryta. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

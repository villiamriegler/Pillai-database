section 6.6).
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.
3.
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (powder for concentrate).
White to off-white to pale yellow powder.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Xydalba is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) in 
adults and paediatric patients aged 3 months and older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Adults
The recommended dose of dalbavancin is 1,500 mg administered as either a single infusion of 
1,500 mg or as 1,000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Children and adolescents aged from 6 years to less than 18 years
The recommended dose of dalbavancin is a single dose of 18 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg).
Infants and children aged from 3 months to less than 6 years
The recommended dose of dalbavancin is a single dose of 22.5 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not required for adult and paediatric patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance  30 to 79 ml/min). Dose adjustments are not required for adult 
2
patients receiving regularly scheduled haemodialysis (3 times/week), and dalbavancin may be 
administered without regard to the timing of haemodialysis.
In adult patients with chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are 
not receiving regularly scheduled haemodialysis, the recommended dose is reduced to either 1,000 mg 
administered as a single infusion or 750 mg followed one week later by 375 mg (see section 5.2).
There is insufficient information to recommend dosage adjustment for patients younger than 18 years 
with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Currently available information is described in 
section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made.
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of dalbavancin is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh A). Caution should be exercised when prescribing dalbavancin to patients with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B & C) as no data are available to determine appropriate 
dosing (see sections 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of dalbavancin in children aged < 3 months old has not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be 
made.
Method of administration 
Intravenous use
Xydalba must be reconstituted and then further diluted prior to administration by intravenous infusion
over a 30 - minute period. For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product 
before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypersensitivity reactions
Dalbavancin should be administered with caution in patients known to be hypersensitive to other 
glycopeptides since cross-hypersensitivity may occur. If an allergic reaction to dalbavancin occurs, 
administration should be discontinued and appropriate therapy for the allergic reaction should be 
instituted.
Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile-associated diarrhoea
Antibacterial-associated colitis and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported with the use of 
nearly all antibiotics and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important 
to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhoea during or subsequent to the treatment 
with dalbavancin (see section 4.8). In such circumstance, the discontinuation of dalbavancin and the 
use of supportive measures together with the administration of specific treatment for Clostridioides 
(formerly Clostridium) difficile should be considered. These patients must never be treated with 
medicinal products that suppress the peristalsis.
Infusion-related reactions
Xydalba is to be administered via intravenous infusion, using a total infusion time of 30 minutes to 
minimise the risk of infusion-related reactions. Rapid intravenous infusions of glycopeptide 
3
antibacterial agents can cause reactions including flushing of the upper body, urticaria, pruritus, and/or 
rash. Stopping or slowing the infusion may result in cessation of these reactions.
Renal impairment
Information on the efficacy and safety of dalbavancin in patients with creatinine clearance 
< 30 ml/min is limited. Based on simulations, dose adjustment is needed for adult patients with 
chronic renal impairment whose creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min and who are not receiving regular 
haemodialysis (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). There is insufficient information to recommend dosage 
adjustment for patients younger than 18 years with creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2.
Mixed infections
In mixed infections in which Gram-negative bacteria are suspected patients should also be treated with 
an appropriate antibacterial agent(s) against Gram-negative bacteria (see section 5.1).
Non-susceptible organisms
The use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of non-susceptible micro-organisms. If 
superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.
Limitations of the clinical data
There is limited data on safety and efficacy of dalbavancin when administered for more than two doses 
(one week apart). In the major trials in ABSSSI the types of infections treated were confined to 
cellulitis/erysipelas, abscesses and wound infections only. There is no experience with dalbavancin in 
the treatment of severely immunocompromised patients.
Excipients
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Results from an in vitro receptor screening study do not indicate a likely interaction with other 
therapeutic targets or a potential for clinically relevant pharmacodynamic interactions (see 
section 5.1).
Clinical drug-drug interaction studies with dalbavancin have not been conducted.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin.
Dalbavancin is not metabolised by CYP enzymes in vitro, therefore co-administered CYP inducers or 
inhibitors are unlikely to influence the pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin.
It is not known if dalbavancin is a substrate for hepatic uptake and efflux transporters. 
Co-administration with inhibitors of these transporters may increase the exposure to dalbavancin. 
Examples of such transporter inhibitors are boosted protease inhibitors, verapamil, quinidine, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin and cyclosporine.
Potential for dalbavancin to affect the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products.
The interaction potential of dalbavancin on medicinal products metabolised by CYP enzymes is 
expected to be low since it is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP enzymes in vitro. There are 
no data on dalbavancin as an inhibitor of CYP2C8.
4
It is not known if dalbavancin is an inhibitor of transporters. Increased exposure to transporter 
substrates sensitive for inhibited transporter activity, such as statins and digoxin, cannot be excluded if 
combined with dalbavancin.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of dalbavancin in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Xydalba is not recommended during pregnancy, unless the potential expected benefit clearly justifies 
the potential risk to the foetus.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether dalbavancin is excreted in human milk. However, dalbavancin is excreted in 
the milk of lactating rats and may be excreted in human breast milk. Dalbavancin is not well absorbed 
orally; however, an impact on the gastrointestinal flora or mouth flora of a breast-feeding infant cannot 
be excluded. A decision must be made whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to 
continue/discontinue therapy with Xydalba taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
Studies in animals have shown reduced fertility (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Xydalba may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines, as dizziness has been 
reported in a small number of patients (see section 4.8).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In Phase 2/3 clinical studies, 2,473 adult patients received dalbavancin administered as either a single 
infusion of 1,500 mg or as 1,000 mg followed one week later by 500 mg. The most common adverse 
reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients treated with dalbavancin were nausea (2.4 %), diarrhoea 
(1.9 %), and headache (1.3 %) and were generally of mild or moderate severity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions (Table 1)
The following adverse reactions have been identified in Phase 2/3 clinical trials with dalbavancin. 
Adverse reactions are classified according to System Organ Class and frequency. Frequency 
categories are derived according to the following conventions: very common (≥ 1/10), common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Class adverse reactions
Ototoxicity has been associated with glycopeptide use (vancomycin and teicoplanin); patients who are 
receiving concomitant therapy with an ototoxic medicinal product, such as an aminoglycoside, may be 
at increased risk.
Paediatric population
The safety of dalbavancin was evaluated in one Phase 3 clinical trial which included 168 paediatric 
patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with ABSSSI treated with dalbavancin (90 patients 
treated with a single dose of dalbavancin and 78 patients, all of them aged 3 months and older, treated 
with a two-dose regimen of dalbavancin). Overall, the safety findings of dalbavancin in these 
paediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with dalbavancin, as dose-limiting 
6
toxicity has not been observed in clinical studies. In Phase 1 studies, healthy volunteers have been 
administered single doses of up to 1,500 mg, and cumulative doses up to 4,500 mg over a period of up 
to 8 weeks, with no signs of toxicity or laboratory results of clinical concern.  In Phase 3 studies, 
patients have been administered single doses of up to 1,500 mg.
Treatment of overdose with dalbavancin should consist of observation and general supportive 
measures. Although no information is available specifically regarding the use of haemodialysis to treat 
overdose, it should be noted that in a Phase 1 study in patients with renal impairment, less than 6 % of 
the recommended dalbavancin dose was removed after 3 hours of haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antibacterials for systemic use, glycopeptide antibacterials,
ATC code: J01XA04.
Mechanism of action
Dalbavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide.
Its mechanism of action in susceptible Gram-positive bacteria involves interruption of cell wall 
synthesis by binding to the terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine of the stem peptide in nascent cell wall 
peptidoglycan, preventing cross-linking (transpeptidation and transglycosylation) of disaccharide 
subunits resulting in bacterial cell death.
Mechanism of resistance
All Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to dalbavancin.
Resistance to dalbavancin in Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. is mediated by VanA, a 
genotype that results in modification of the target peptide in nascent cell wall. Based on in vitro
studies the activity of dalbavancin is not affected by other classes of vancomycin resistance genes.
Dalbavancin MICs are higher for vancomycin-intermediate staphylococci (VISA) than for fully 
vancomycin susceptible strains. If the isolates with higher dalbavancin MICs represent stable 
phenotypes and are correlated with resistance to the other glycopeptides, then the likely mechanism 
would be an increase in the number of glycopeptide targets in nascent peptidoglycan.
Cross-resistance between dalbavancin and other classes of antibiotics was not seen in in vitro studies.
Methicillin resistance has no impact on dalbavancin activity.
Interactions with other antibacterial agents
In in vitro studies, no antagonism has been observed between dalbavancin and other commonly used 
antibiotics (i.e. cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, aztreonam, 
ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), when tested against 
12 species of Gram-negative pathogens (see section 4.5).
Susceptibility testing breakpoints
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints determined by the European Committee on 
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are:


Staphylococcus spp.: Susceptible ≤ 0.125 mg/l; Resistant > 0.125 mg/l,
Beta-haemolytic streptococci of Groups A, B, C, G: Susceptible ≤ 0.125 mg/l; Resistant
> 0.125 mg/l,
7

Viridans group streptococci (Streptococcus anginosus group only): Susceptible
≤ 0.125 mg/l; Resistant > 0.125 mg/l.
PK/PD relationship
Bactericidal activity against staphylococci in vitro is time-dependent at serum concentrations of 
dalbavancin similar to those obtained at the recommended dose in humans. In vivo PK/PD relationship 
of dalbavancin for S. aureus was investigated using a neutropenic model of animal infection. This 
showed that the antibacterial activity of dalbavancin appears to best correlate with the ratio of area 
under the unbound plasma concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC).
Clinical efficacy against specific pathogens
Efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies against the pathogens listed for ABSSSI that were 
susceptible to dalbavancin in vitro:





Staphylococcus aureus,
Streptococcus pyogenes,
Streptococcus agalactiae,
Streptococcus dysgalactiae,
Streptococcus anginosus group (includes S. anginosus, S. intermedius, and S. 
constellatus).
Antibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens
Clinical efficacy has not been established against the following pathogens although in vitro studies 
suggest that they would be susceptible to dalbavancin in the absence of acquired mechanisms of 
resistance:



Group G streptococci
Clostridium perfringens
Peptostreptococcus spp.
Paediatric population
Xydalba has been evaluated in paediatric patients aged from birth to < 18 years with ABSSSI in one 
Phase 3 open-label, randomised, comparator controlled clinical trial. The study included 168 patients 
treated with dalbavancin (90 patients treated with a single dose of dalbavancin and 78 patients, all of 
them aged 3 months and older, treated with a two-dose regimen of dalbavancin) and 30 patients 
treated with comparator. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Xydalba 
and secondary objectives included assessment of efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Efficacy was a 
descriptive endpoint. Clinical cure rate at TOC (mITT) was 95.1 % (78/82) in the Xydalba single-dose 
arm, 97.3 % (72/74) in the Xydalba two-dose arm and 100 % (30/30) in the comparator arm. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xydalba in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in ABSSSI (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin have been characterised in healthy subjects, patients, and special 
populations. Systemic exposures to dalbavancin are dose proportional following single doses over a 
range of 140 to 1120 mg, indicating linear pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin. No accumulation of 
dalbavancin was observed following multiple intravenous infusions administered once-weekly for up 
to 8 weeks (1,000 mg on Day 1, followed by up to 7 weekly 500 mg doses) in healthy adults.
The mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) was 372 (range 333 to 405) hours. The pharmacokinetics 
of dalbavancin are best described using a three-compartment model (α and β distributional phases 
8
followed by a terminal elimination phase). Thus, the distributional half-life (t1/2β), which constitutes 
most of the clinically-relevant concentration-time profile, ranged from 5 to 7 days and is consistent 
with once-weekly dosing.
Estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of dalbavancin following the two-dose regimen and the 
single-dose regimen, respectively, are shown in Table 2 below.

respectively, are shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Dalbavancin Plasma Concentrations versus time in a typical adult ABSSSI patient 
(simulation using population pharmacokinetic model) for both the single and the two-dose 
regimens.
Distribution
Clearance and volume of distribution at steady state are comparable between healthy subjects and 
9
patients with infections. The volume of distribution at steady state was similar to the volume of 
extracellular fluid. Dalbavancin is reversibly bound to human plasma proteins, primarily to albumin. 
The plasma protein binding of dalbavancin is 93 % and is not altered as a function of drug 
concentration, renal insufficiency, or hepatic insufficiency. Following a single intravenous dose of 
1,000 mg in healthy volunteers AUC in skin blister fluid amounted (bound and unbound dalbavancin) 
to approximately 60 % of the plasma AUC at day 7 post-dose.
Biotransformation
Metabolites have not been observed in significant amounts in human plasma. The metabolites 
hydroxy-dalbavancin and mannosyl aglycone have been detected in urine (< 25 % of administered 
dose). The metabolic pathways responsible for producing these metabolites have not been identified; 
however, due to the relatively minor contribution of metabolism to the overall elimination of 
dalbavancin, drug-drug interactions via inhibition or induction of metabolism of dalbavancin are not 
anticipated. Hydroxy-dalbavancin and mannosyl aglycone show significantly less antibacterial activity 
compared to dalbavancin.
Elimination
Following administration of a single 1,000 mg dose in healthy subjects, an average of 19 % to 33 % of 
the administered dalbavancin dose was excreted in urine as dalbavancin and 8 % to 12 % as the 
metabolite hydroxy-dalbavancin. Approximately 20 % of the administered dose was excreted in 
faeces.
Special populations
Renal impairment
The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 28 adult subjects with varying degrees of 
renal impairment and in 15 matched control subjects with normal renal function. Following a single 
dose of 500 mg or 1,000 mg dalbavancin, the mean plasma clearance (CLT) was reduced 11 %, 35 %, 
and 47 % in subjects with mild (CLCR 50 - 79 ml/min), moderate (CLCR 30 – 49 ml/min), and severe 
(CLCR < 30 ml/min) renal impairment, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. 
The mean AUC for subjects with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min was approximately 2 - fold higher. 
The clinical significance of the decrease in mean plasma CLT, and the associated increase in AUC0-∞ 
noted in these pharmacokinetic studies of dalbavancin in subjects with severe renal impairment has not 
been established. Dalbavancin pharmacokinetics in subjects with end-stage renal disease receiving 
regularly scheduled renal dialysis (3 times/week) were similar to those observed in subjects with mild 
to moderate renal impairment, and less than 6 % of an administered dose is removed after 3 hours of 
haemodialysis. For dosing instructions in adult subjects with renal impairment refer to section 4.2.
No observed PK data are available in paediatric patients with severe renal impairment. The predicted 
dalbavancin mean AUC for paediatric subjects with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30
ml/min/1.73 m2) was approximately 13-30 % higher compared to paediatric patients with normal renal 
function treated with the same dose, based on population pharmacokinetic modelling.
Hepatic impairment
The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were evaluated in 17 subjects with mild, moderate, or severe 
hepatic impairment and compared to 9 matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. The 
mean AUC was unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function; however, the mean AUC decreased by 28 % and 31 %, respectively, in 
subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. The cause and the clinical significance of the 
decreased exposure in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic function are unknown. For dosing 
instructions in subjects with hepatic impairment refer to section 4.2.
10
Gender
Clinically significant gender-related differences in dalbavancin pharmacokinetics have not been 
observed in healthy subjects or in patients with infections. No dose adjustment is recommended based 
on gender.
Elderly
The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin were not significantly altered with age; therefore, dose 
adjustment is not necessary based on age (see section 4.2). The experience with dalbavancin in elderly 
is limited: 276 patients ≥ 75 years of age were included in the Phase 2/3 clinical studies, of which 173 
received dalbavancin. Patients up to 93 years of age have been included in clinical studies.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin has been evaluated in 218 individual paediatric patients [4 days 
to 17 years of age, including a preterm neonate (gestational age 36 weeks; n=1) and term neonates 
(gestational age 37 to 40 weeks; n=6)] with creatinine clearance 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and above. There 
is insufficient information to assess the exposure of dalbavancin in the paediatric patients with 
creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. The model predicted plasma AUC0-120h of 
dalbavancin in preterm neonates at birth (gestational age 26 weeks to <37 weeks) was approximately 
60 % of that in adult patients.

5.3
Preclinical safety data
Dalbavancin toxicity has been evaluated after daily intravenous administration for durations of up to 
3 months in rats and dogs. Dose-dependent toxicity included serum chemistry and histological 
evidence of renal and hepatic injury, reduced red blood cell parameters and injection site irritation. In 
dogs only, infusion reactions characterised by skin swelling and/or redness (not associated with the 
injection site), mucosal pallor, salivation, vomiting, sedation, and modest declines in blood pressure 
and increases in heart rate were observed in a dose-dependent manner. These infusion reactions were 
transient (resolved within 1 hour post-dosing) and were attributed to histamine release. Dalbavancin 
toxicity profile in juvenile rats was consistent with that previously observed in adult rats at the same 
dose (mg/kg /day) levels.
11
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of a teratogenic effect. In rats, at 
exposures approximately 3 times above clinical exposure, there was reduced fertility and an increased 
incidence of embryo-lethality, reductions in foetal weight and skeletal ossification and increased 
neonatal mortality. In rabbits, abortion occurred in conjunction with maternal toxicity at exposures 
below the human therapeutic range.
Long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted. Dalbavancin was not mutagenic or 
clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests.

The content of each vial must be reconstituted by slowly adding 25 ml of water for 
injections.
Do not shake. To avoid foaming, alternate between gentle swirling and inversion of the 
vial, until its contents are completely dissolved. The reconstitution time may be up to 
5 minutes.
The reconstituted concentrate in the vial contains 20 mg/ml dalbavancin.
The reconstituted concentrate must be a clear, colourless to yellow solution with no 
visible particles.
The reconstituted concentrate must be further diluted with 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose 
solution for infusion.
To dilute the reconstituted concentrate, the appropriate volume of the 20 mg / ml 
concentrate must be transferred from the vial to an intravenous bag or bottle containing 
50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion. For example: 25 ml of the concentrate 
contains 500 mg dalbavancin.
After dilution the solution for infusion must have a final concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml 
dalbavancin
The solution for infusion must be clear, colourless to yellow solution with no visible
particles.
If particulate matter or discoloration is identified, the solution must be discarded.
Xydalba must not be mixed with other medicinal products or intravenous solutions. Sodium chloride 
containing solutions can cause precipitation and should NOT be used for reconstitution or dilution. 
The compatibility of reconstituted Xydalba concentrate has only been established with 50 mg/ml (5 %) 
glucose solution for infusion.
If a common intravenous line is being used to administer other medicinal products in addition to 
Xydalba, the line should be flushed before and after each Xydalba infusion with 5 % glucose solution 
for infusion. 
Use in the paediatric population
For paediatric patients, the dose of Xydalba will vary according to the age and weight of the child up 
to a maximum of 1,500 mg. Transfer the required dose of reconstituted dalbavancin solution, 
according to the instructions above, based on the child’s weight, from the vial to an intravenous bag or 
bottle containing 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion. The diluted solution must have a final 
dalbavancin concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml.
Table 4 below provides information to prepare an infusion solution with a final concentration of 
2 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml (sufficient for most scenarios), to be administered by syringe pump, to achieve a 
dose of 22.5 mg/kg in paediatric patients from 3 to 12 months of age weighing from 3 to 12 kg. 
Alternative concentrations may be prepared, but must have a final concentration range of 1 to 5 mg/ml
of dalbavancin. Refer to Table 4 to confirm the calculations. Values shown are approximate. Note that 
the table is NOT inclusive of all possible calculated doses for every age group but may be utilised to 
estimate the approximate volume to verify the calculation.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Xydalba is and what it is used for
Xydalba contains the active substance dalbavancin, which is an antibiotic of the glycopeptide group.
Xydalba is used to treat adults and children aged 3 months and over with infections of the skin or 
in the layers of flesh below the skin. 
Xydalba works by killing certain bacteria, which can cause serious infections. It kills these bacteria by 
interfering with the formation of bacterial cell walls.
If you also have other bacteria that cause your infection, your doctor may decide to treat you with 
other antibiotics in addition to Xydalba.
2. What you need to know before you are given Xydalba
Do not use Xydalba if you are allergic to dalbavancin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before being given Xydalba:



If you have or have had kidney problems. Depending on your age and the condition of 
your kidney, your doctor may have to reduce your dose.
If you are suffering from diarrhoea, or you have previously suffered from diarrhoea 
when being treated with antibiotics.
If you are allergic to other antibiotics such as vancomycin or teicoplanin.
Diarrhoea during or after treatment
If you develop diarrhoea during or after your treatment, tell your doctor at once. Do not take any 
medicine to treat your diarrhoea without first checking with your doctor.
23
Infusion-related reactions
Intravenous infusions with these types of antibiotics can cause flushing of the upper body, hives, 
itching and/or rashes. If you experience these types of reactions your doctor may decide to stop or 
slow the infusion.
Other infections
Using antibiotics may sometimes allow a new and different infection to develop. If this happens tell 
your doctor and they will decide what to do.
Children
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 months. The use of Xydalba in children under 3 months
has not been studied enough.
Other medicines and Xydalba
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Xydalba is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. This is because it is not 
known what effect it might have on an unborn baby. Before you are given this medicine, tell your 
doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. You and 
your doctor will decide if you will be given Xydalba.
It is not known if Xydalba passes into breast milk in humans. Ask your doctor for advice before 
breast-feeding your baby. You and your doctor will decide if you will be given Xydalba. You should 
not breastfeed when given Xydalba.
Driving and using machines
Xydalba may cause dizziness. Take care with driving and using machines after you have been given 
this medicine.
Xydalba contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
3.
How you will be given Xydalba
Xydalba will be given to you by a doctor or nurse.
 Adults: Xydalba is given in a single dose of 1,500 mg or in two doses a week apart: 1,000 mg on 
Day 1 and 500 mg on Day 8. 
 Children and adolescents aged from 6 years to less than 18 years: Xydalba is given in a 
single dose of 18 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg).
 Infants and children aged from 3 months to less than 6 years: Xydalba is given in a single 
dose of 22.5 mg/kg (maximum 1,500 mg).
The dose for children aged 3 months to less than 18 years will be calculated by the doctor based on the 
age and weight of the child. 
24
You will be given Xydalba through a drip directly into your bloodstream through a vein 
(intravenously) over 30 minutes.
Patients with chronic kidney problems
If you suffer from chronic kidney problems, your doctor may decide to reduce your dose. There is 
not enough information to recommend the use of Xydalba for children with chronic kidney 
problems.
If you are given more Xydalba than you should
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are concerned that you may have been given too much 
Xydalba.
If you miss a dose of Xydalba
Tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you are concerned that you are missing the 2nd dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing.
Xydalba must be reconstituted with sterile water for injections and subsequently diluted with 
50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion.
Xydalba vials are for single-use only.
Instructions for reconstitution and dilution
Aseptic technique must be used for reconstitution and dilution of Xydalba.

The content of each vial must be reconstituted by slowly adding 25 ml of water for 
injections.
Do not shake. To avoid foaming, alternate between gentle swirling and inversion of the 
vial, until its contents are completely dissolved. The reconstitution time may be up to 
5 minutes.
The reconstituted concentrate in the vial contains 20 mg /ml dalbavancin.
The reconstituted concentrate must be a clear, colourless to yellow solution with no 
visible particles.
The reconstituted concentrate must be further diluted with 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose 
solution for infusion.
To dilute the reconstituted concentrate, the appropriate volume of the 20 mg/ml 
concentrate must be transferred from the vial to an intravenous bag or bottle containing 
50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion. For example: 25 ml of the concentrate 
contains 500 mg dalbavancin.
After dilution the solution for infusion must have a final concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml 
dalbavancin
The solution for infusion must be clear, colourless to yellow solution with no visible 
particles.
If particulate matter or discoloration is identified, the solution must be discarded.
Xydalba must not be mixed with other medicinal products or intravenous solutions. Sodium chloride 
containing solutions can cause precipitation and should NOT be used for reconstitution or dilution. 
The compatibility of reconstituted Xydalba concentrate has only been established with 50 mg/ml (5 %) 
glucose solution for infusion.
If a common intravenous line is being used to administer other medicinal products in addition to 
Xydalba, the line should be flushed before and after each Xydalba infusion with 5 % glucose solution 
for infusion. 
Use in the paediatric population
For paediatric patients, the dose of Xydalba will vary according to the age and weight of the child up 
to a maximum of 1,500 mg. Transfer the required dose of reconstituted dalbavancin solution, 
according to the instructions above, based on the child’s weight, from the vial to an intravenous bag or 
bottle containing 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution for infusion. The diluted solution must have a final 
dalbavancin concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml.
Table 1 below provides information to prepare an infusion solution with a final concentration of 
2 mg/ml or 5 mg/ml (sufficient for most scenarios), to be administered by syringe pump, to achieve a 
dose of 22.5 mg/kg in paediatric patients from 3 to 12 months of age weighing from 3 to 12 kg. 
Alternative concentrations may be prepared, but must have a final concentration range of 1 to 5 mg/ml 
of dalbavancin. Refer to Table 1 to confirm the calculations. Values shown are approximate. Note that 
the table is NOT inclusive of all possible calculated doses for every age group but may be utilised to 
estimate the approximate volume to verify the calculation.

ANNEX IV
CONCLUSIONS ON THE REQUEST FOR ONE YEAR MARKETING PROTECTION 
PRESENTED BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY
31
Conclusions presented by the European Medicines Agency on:

One-year marketing protection
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the marketing authorisation holder, taking into account 
the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new 
therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies as 
further explained in the European Public Assessment Report.

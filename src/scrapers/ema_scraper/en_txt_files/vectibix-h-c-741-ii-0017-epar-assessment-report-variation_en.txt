3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
Panitumumab,  a  recombinant  fully  human  IgG2  monoclonal  antibody,  binds  with  high  affinity  and 
specificity to the human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a transmembrane glycoprotein that 
is a member of a subfamily of type I receptor tyrosine kinases.  EGFR promotes cell growth in normal 
epithelial tissues and is expressed on a variety of tumour cells.  
Panitumumab  binds  to  the  ligand  binding  domain  of  EGFR  and  inhibits  receptor  autophosphorylation 
induced by all known EGFR ligands.  Binding of panitumumab to EGFR results in internalisation of the 
receptor,  inhibition  of  cell  growth,  induction  of  apoptosis  and  decreased  interleukin  8  (IL-8)  and 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.  The KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene 
homologue)  gene  encodes  a  small,  GTP-binding  protein  involved  in  signal  transduction.    A  variety  of 
stimuli,  including  that  from  the  EGFR  activates  KRAS  which  in  turn  stimulates  other  intracellular 
proteins to promote cell proliferation, cell survival and angiogenesis.  Activating mutations in the KRAS 
gene  occur  frequently  in  a  variety  of  human  tumours  and  have  been  implicated  in  both  oncogenesis 
and tumour progression.  KRAS mutations have been shown to be a negative predictive biomarker for 
anti-EGFR therapy. 
Vectibix (panitumumab) was first authorised in the EU on 03 December 2007.  Based on available data 
at  the  time  of  the  application,  panitumumab  was  granted  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  as 
monotherapy for the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with 
non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS after failure of fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing 
chemotherapy regimens. 
Amgen  Europe  B.V.  submitted  an  application  for  a  type  II  variation  in  April  2010  to  extend  the 
indication of Vectibix to 1st- and 2nd-line combinations with chemotherapy and proposed to revise the 
wording of the Vectibix indication as follows: 
treatment of patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)  
- in combination with chemotherapy  
- as monotherapy in patients after the failure of standard chemotherapy. 
In their response to the first CHMP request for supplementary information, the MAH revised the 
wording of the proposed indication in combination with chemotherapy as follows: 
• 
in combination with oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy 
After the second CHMP request for supplementary information, the MAH further revised the wording of 
the proposed indication in combination with chemotherapy as follows: 
• 
in combination with FOLFOX or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. 
3.2.  Quality aspects 
No new data related to pharmaceutical quality were submitted with this variation application, which is 
considered acceptable. 
3.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No  new  non-clinical  data  were  submitted  with  this  variation  application,  which  is  considered 
acceptable.

3.4.  Clinical aspects 
3.4.1.  Introduction 
Colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  is  the  third  most  common  cancer,  comprising  approximately  11%  of  all  new 
cancers  worldwide  (Jemal  et  al,  2010).    Of  newly  diagnosed  patients,  15% to  25%  have  metastatic 
disease  at  diagnosis  (Kindler  and  Shulman,  2001)  and  up  to  50%  of  all  patients  eventually  develop 
metastatic disease (Kindler and Shulman, 2001; McLeod et al, 2000).  The 5-year survival rate is only 
11% in patients with metastatic disease (Kindler and Shulman, 2001; Pazdur et al, 1999). Aside from 
cases  of  potentially  resectable  metastatic  disease,  mCRC  cannot  be  cured  with  currently  available 
chemotherapy  regimens,  and  most  patients  will  have  progressive  disease  through  multiple  lines  of 
therapy. In addition, some patients experience unacceptable toxicity when treated with other currently 
available  agents.  Thus,  there  remains  a  significant  unmet  medical  need  for  alternative,  effective 
treatment options for patients with mCRC. 
The  treatment  of  advanced  colorectal  cancer  has  evolved  significantly  in  recent  years.  Over  the  past 
decade,  treatment  outcomes  for  patients  with  mCRC  have  improved  due  to  the  introduction  of  new 
agents.  These improvements were made in a step-wise fashion and they have resulted in increases in 
median  OS  from  approximately  12 months  with  bolus  5-fluorouracil  (5-FU)  alone  to  over  20  months 
with  sequential  combinations  of 
irinotecan,  oxaliplatin,  and 
fluoropyrimidine  chemotherapy.  
Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimens (e.g. FOLFOX) and irinotecan-based chemotherapy regimens 
(eg, FOLFIRI) are currently recognised in clinical practice guidelines as the standard of care for initial 
and  second-line  treatment  of  mCRC  in  patients  with  good  (ECOG  0/1)  performance  status  (National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2009; UK NICE, 2005; Tournigand et al, 2004).  Studies have shown 
that in combination with 5-FU, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-containing regimens are effective in both the 
initial and second-line settings, regardless of the sequence of administration (National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network, 2010; Tournigand et al, 2004).   
The two key Phase III studies supporting this extension of indication were studies 20050203 (1st line 
treatment)  and  20050181  (2nd  line  treatment)  where  panitumumab  was  combined  with  FOLFOX  and 
FOLFIRI  chemotherapies,  respectively.  Both  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  conducted  in  a  large 
number  of  centres  (overall  >  300)  in  Western,  Central  and  Eastern  Europe,  Latin  America,  Australia, 
Canada,  USA,  South  Africa,  and  Japan.    The  majority  of  patients  were  European,  but  patients  were 
allocated  to  two  geographic  regions  as  defined  by  the  MAH:  Western  Europe  together  with  North 
America  and  Australia  in  one  region  and  Central-Eastern  Europe  together  with  Latin  America,  South 
Africa and Japan in the Rest-Of-World (ROW) region. 
Provision  of  the  Clinical  Study  Reports  (CSRs)  for  these  studies  fulfilled  specific  obligations  SOB  005, 
006,  009,  010,  012  (as  a  duplicate  of  010  after  its  deadline  was  extended),  011  and  013  of  the 
Vectibix conditional marketing authorization as a monotherapy treatment for mCRC.  
A  tabular  overview  of  all  clinical  studies  supporting  the  use  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy for the treatment of wild-type KRAS mCRC is presented in the following Table 1.

GCP 
The  Clinical  trials  were  performed  in  accordance  with  GCP  as  claimed  by  the  MAH.  The  MAH  has  also 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Both  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  conducted  in  a  large  number  of  centres  worldwide.  The  centres 
were monitored by Amgen or a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) depending on their location.  A 
few  centres  with  high  recruitment  were  audited  by  Amgen  with  an  acceptable  level  of  source  data 
verification being performed; in addition, 4 centres were inspected by local Regulatory Authorities. 
In both studies, the proportion of patients with important protocol deviations according to the protocol, 
i.e. thought to potentially impact the patient's safety or statistical analysis conclusions, was considered 
high,  especially  in  the  experimental  arm  (up  to  50%).    In  study  20050203,  efficacy  results  varied 
significantly  between  different  geographic  regions.  Similarly,  in  study  20050181,  the  reporting  of 
severe and serious adverse events varied significantly depending on the geographic region.  Therefore, 
concerns were raised about the GCP compliance of these trials. 
A  GCP  inspection  of  the  CRO  in  the  UK  and  of  three  sites  of  study  20050181  (in  Bulgaria,  Lithuania, 
and Russia) was conducted. 
Among the deficiencies identified during the inspections two major findings were identified at the CRO 
site in connection with the data management, one major with regard to the safety data at the clinical 
investigator site in Lithuania and one major with regard to eligibility at the site in Bulgaria. 
The  minor  findings  were  considered  as  "not  having  impact  on  the  integrity  of  the  patients  or  on  the 
quality of data". 
Based  on  these  findings  the  inspection  report  concluded  that  the  study  was  conducted  in  compliance 
with GCP at the sites and the CRO.  It was the opinion of the inspectors that the patients in this study 
had  received  acceptable  information  about  the  conduct  of  the  study  and  that  the  patients  were  well 
taken care of by a professional study team.  No major concerns were identified during the inspections 
and  it  was  the  opinion  of  the  inspectors  that  the  data  documented  and  reported  in  the  study  were 
credible.  It was the recommendation of the inspectors that the results in the report could be used for 
evaluation and assessment of the application. 
The CHMP noted that a number of weaknesses/errors were detected during the assessment of the data 
presented  in  the  CSRs.    It  was  considered  that  the  quality  control  in  study  monitoring,  data 
management  and  analysis  was  not  of  high  level.    However,  based  on  the  GCP  inspection  findings,  it 
was  accepted  that  these weaknesses  may  not  have  had  a  major impact  on  the  overall conclusions  of 
the trials. 
3.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug-drug interactions with oxaliplatin and irinotecan were discussed.  Panitumumab is not expected to 
have  pharmacokinetic  drug-drug  interaction  with  oxaliplatin  as  their  clearance  mechanisms  do  not 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 8/69
 
 
 
   
 
overlap;  therefore,  no  interaction  study  was  conducted.    As  for  irinotecan,  potential  pharmacokinetic 
interactions  were  addressed  in  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  through  a  cross-study 
comparison  between  panitumumab  as  monotherapy  and  as  combination  with  IFL/FOLFIRI  therapy.  
Based  on  this  analysis,  irinotecan  did  not  appear  to  have  an  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
panitumumab but the impact of panitumumab on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan was inconclusive.  
Thus, the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan (administered at 180 mg/m2 Q2W) and its active metabolite 
SN-38  were  compared  with  and  without  concomitant  panitumumab  administration  (6  mg/kg  Q2W)  in 
19 patients with unresectable mCRC (study 20062010).  The statistical summary of irinotecan and SN-
38 pharmacokinetics is provided in Table 2. 
Table 2: Comparisons of AUC and Cmax of Irinotecan and SN-38 With (cycle 2) and Without 
(Cycle 1) Panitumumab Administration 
3.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Due  to  the  high  variability  of  irinotecan  concentrations  (CV  >  30%)  it  was  hypothesised  that 
panitumumab would not have a clinically important effect on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan if the 
90% CIs of the ratio of geometric means for the Cmax and AUC values for irinotecan with and without 
concomitant panitumumab administration fell within the interval of 0.70 – 1.43. 
Actual results showed that the 90% CIs of the ratios for irinotecan lay within the 0.80 – 1.25 interval 
and only the lower limit of the 90% CIs of the ratios for SN-38 was slightly lower than 0.80; of note, 
SN-38  concentrations  were  significantly  lower  when  irinotecan  was  combined  with  panitumumab 
(higher limit of the CIs below 1). 
3.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the conclusion that panitumumab did not have any impact of clinical significance on irinotecan 
and SN-38 concentrations was endorsed. 
3.5.  Clinical efficacy  
3.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies were submitted.

3.5.2.  Main studies 
Two  pivotal  Phase  III  studies  supported  this  extension  of  indication,  namely  study  2005023  (1st  line 
treatment)  and  study  20050181  (2nd  line  treatment)  in  which  panitumumab  was  combined  with 
FOLFOX and FOLFIRI chemotherapies, respectively.  
Study 20050203 (1st line) 
This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label,  comparative  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
panitumumab  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) 
relative to FOLFOX alone in patients with previously untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon 
or rectum.

-  prior  therapies  including  but  not  limited  to  chemotherapy,  oxaliplatin,  EGFR  inhibitors,  radiotherapy 
(≤ 14 days before randomization), or other investigational therapies (≤ 30 days before randomisation) 
Treatments 
One cycle of chemotherapy lasted 14 days. 
Panitumumab  was  administered  on  Day  1  of  each  cycle  just  prior  to  the  administration  of 
chemotherapy  as  an  intravenous  infusion  at  a  dose  of  6  mg/kg  until  patients  developed  disease 
progression or were unable to tolerate panitumumab. 
The components of FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin, 5-FU, and LV) were obtained by each site according 
to routine institutional practice.  The FOLFOX regimen was as follows: 
- Day 1: oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 + LV 200 mg/m2 racemate (or 100 mg/m2 l-LV) IV infusion, followed by 
5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus, followed by 5-FU 600 mg/m2 as a 22-hour continuous IV infusion; 
- Day 2: same as Day 1 without oxaliplatin. 
A  standardised  protocol  was  provided  to  adjust  (i.e.  withhold,  reduce,  or  delay)  the  doses  of 
panitumumab  or  chemotherapy  in  case  of  emergent  toxicities.    Patients  receiving  panitumumab  plus 
FOLFOX  who  demonstrated  objective  response  or  who  had  stable  disease  but  became  intolerant  to 
chemotherapy  or  panitumumab  could  continue  panitumumab  or  chemotherapy,  respectively,  until 
disease progression or intolerance to study treatment.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess whether panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy 
improved  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  compared  to  FOLFOX  alone  as  first-line  therapy  for  mCRC 
among patients with wild-type KRAS tumours and patients with mutant KRAS tumours. 
Secondary  objectives  included  evaluation  of  overall  survival  (OS),  objective  response  rate  (ORR), 
duration  of  response,  time  to  progression,  and  safety  and  tolerability  among  patients  with  wild-type 
KRAS (WT) tumours and patients with mutant KRAS (MK) tumours. 
Tertiary objectives were to evaluate time to response and  patient-reported  outcomes among patients 
with wild-type KRAS tumours and patients with mutant KRAS tumours and exploratory objectives were 
to investigate potential biomarker development based on assessment of blood cells, tumour cells and 
the proposed mechanism of action of the study drug among patients with wild-type KRAS tumours and 
patients with mutant KRAS tumours. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  by  central  radiological  assessment,  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomisation  to  disease  progression  per  modified  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours 
(RECIST) criteria or death. Patients were to be evaluated every 8 weeks until disease progression.  In 
addition  to  the  investigator’s  assessments,  scans  for  tumour  response  of  all  patients  were  centrally 
evaluated  by  a  blinded  panel  of  at  least  2  blinded  independent  radiologists.    The  central  review  of 
radiographic  data  by  the  Independent  Review  Committee  (IRC)  was  used  for  the  primary  analysis  of 
efficacy to reduce potential bias resulting from the open-label nature of the study. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death; patients who were alive at the 
analysis data cut-off were censored at their last contact date. 
Objective response rate (ORR) by central radiological assessment defined as the incidence of either a 
confirmed  complete  or  partial  response  (CR  or  PR)  while  on  the  first-line  treatment  per  modified 
RECIST, as determined by blinded independent central review 
Time to progression defined as time from randomisation date to date of disease progression 
Duration of response calculated only for those patients with a confirmed CR or PR as the time from the 
first  CR  or  PR  (subsequently  confirmed  within  no  less  than  4  weeks)  to  first  observed  disease 
progression 
Incidence of adverse events and significant laboratory changes 
Tertiary efficacy endpoints

Patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D health state index score, EQ-5D overall health rating) 
Sample size 
Sample  size  considerations  were  focused  on  ensuring  sufficient  power  in  the  wild-type  KRAS  stratum 
alone.  It  was  estimated  that  1150  patients  (575  per  arm)  were  needed  to  be  randomized  over  19 
months (with about 900 from the original protocol and about 250 from the enrolment extension, with 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 11/69
 
 
 
   
 
14  months  under  the  original  protocol  and  5  months  for  the  enrolment  extension)  with  a  minimum 
follow-up  of  approximately  12  months  to  achieve  380  events  for  PFS  in  the  Wild-type  KRAS  efficacy 
analysis  set.  With  wild-type  KRAS  prevalence  of  55%  and  a  KRAS  expected  evaluation  rate  of  90%, 
1150 randomized patients would produce about 570 patients that would be tested as wild-type KRAS 
and about 466 patients that would be tested as mutant KRAS.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive panitumumab plus FOLFOX or FOLFOX alone.  
Randomisation  was  centralised  and  stratified  by  geographic  region  (Western  Europe,  Canada,  and 
Australia vs. Rest of World) and ECOG performance status (0 or 1 vs. 2). 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  open-label,  as  blinding  was  not  possible  because  of  expected  skin-related  toxicities  in 
patients receiving panitumumab. To minimize bias in this non-blinded study, tumour assessment based 
on independent central review was used for the analysis of the primary endpoint. 
Statistical methods 
The goals of the statistical analysis of the study were to show whether there was an increase in PFS in 
patients treated with panitumumab plus FOLFOX versus FOLFOX alone: 
 
 
in the Wild-type KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set (primary) 
in the Mutant KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set (secondary). 
A  hierarchical  testing  procedure  for  PFS  and  OS in two  primary analysis  populations  was designed  as 
follows. 
The data cut-off date for the primary analysis was set based on the date by which the PFS event goal 
(380  events:  central  radiology  progressive  disease  or  death)  was  projected  to  be  achieved.  To  allow 
estimation of the median survival time, the primary analysis for overall survival was to occur when at 
least 50% of patients had an event.  
Results  
Participant flow 
Out of 1378 patients screened, 1183 patients were randomised and included in the ITT Analysis Set; 
593 were randomized to panitumumab plus FOLFOX and 590 to FOLFOX alone.

At the cut-off date of August 2009 most patients had discontinued all treatment: 
 
In the Wild-type group, 305 (94%) in the P+FX arm and 321 (97%) in the FX arm.  Panitumumab 
was discontinued in 306 (94%) patients, with the most common reason being disease progression 
(158 [49%]).  FOLFOX was discontinued in 628 (96%) patients: 307 (94%) in the P+FX and 321 
(97%)  in  the  FX  arm.    Among  the  patients  who  discontinued  FOLFOX,  the  reason  was  disease 
progression for 147 (45%) patients in the P+FX arm and 170 (51%) patients in the FX arm. 
 
In the Mutant KRAS group: 202 (91%) in the P+FX arm and 198 (90%) in the FX arm.  FOLFOX 
was  discontinued  in  400  (91%)  patients  (202  [91%]  P+FX,  198  [90%]  FX  alone).    The  most 
common  reason  for  ending  FOLFOX  was  disease  progression  (126  [57%]  P+FX,  119  [54%]  FX 
alone).    Panitumumab  was  discontinued  in  202  (91%)  patients,  126  (57%)  because  of  disease 
progression. 
The other main reasons for treatment discontinuations were adverse event (11 to 16% of the patients 
depending on the treatment arm and KRAS group) and patient request (6 to 16% of the patients).   
There  were  slightly  more  patients  with  protocol  deviations  considered  important  as  per  protocol,  i.e. 
thought  to  potentially  impact  the  patient's  safety  or  statistical  analysis  conclusions,  in  the  P+FX  arm 
(44%) than in the FX alone group (39%).  The most common were “other treatment compliance”, e.g. 
chemotherapy not per protocol (14%) or dosing in spite of neutropenia (33%), and “off-schedule study 
procedures” (13%). 
Recruitment 
The first patient was randomised on 23 August 2006 and the last patient was enrolled on 01 February 
2008. Data cut-off date was 30 September 2008 for the PFS analysis and 28 August 2009 for the OS 
analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
The two pivotal Phase III studies in mCRC (20050203 and 20050181) were ongoing at the time of the 
retrospective analysis of KRAS in the pivotal monotherapy trial (Study 20020408), which demonstrated 
that the treatment effect of panitumumab as a single agent is confined to patients with wild-type KRAS 
mCRC (initial Marketing Authorisation Application).  Subsequently, the protocols and statistical analysis 
plans  (SAPs)  for  both  studies  were  amended  twice  such  that  the  treatment  effect  of  panitumumab in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  could  be  prospectively  analysed  by  tumour  KRAS  status.    The  initial 
study  protocol  of  study  20050203,  dated  09  March  2006,  was  first  amendment  on  10  October  2007, 
before  the  enrolment  period  ended  and  prior  to  any  interim  efficacy  analysis,  so  that  a  sufficient 
number of patients would be enrolled to enable adequate statistical power for analysis within the wild-
type KRAS sub-population. The second amendment occurred on 21 January 2009, prior to any formal 
efficacy  analysis  or  knowledge  of  patient  KRAS  tumour  status  and  after  input  on  Protocol  20050181 
was  received  from  the  FDA  and  CHMP  regarding  implementation  of  data  analysis  according  to  KRAS 
status.  
Baseline data 
The ratio of patients enrolled from Western Europe, Canada and Australia versus the rest of the world 
was  approximately  56:44  in  both  treatment  arms.    Most  patients  were  male  (63%)  and  Caucasian 
(90%).    The  median  age  was  62  years  with  9%  of  the  patients  being ≥  75  years.    The  demographic 
characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  treatment  arms  in  the  WT  group  except  for  a  lower 
proportion of women in the P+FX arm (33%) than in the FX arm (38%).  The same was true in the MK 
CHMP variation assessment report

group  (34%  vs.  42%),  where  there  were  also  more  elderly  (≥  60  years)  patients  in  the  P+FX  arm 
(45%) than in the FX arm (38%). 
Disease  characteristics  are  summarised  in  Tables  3  &  4.    Overall,  they  were  similar  in  WT  and  MK 
tumours except for a slightly higher proportion of colon cancers and a higher CEA concentration in the 
MK group.  The vast majority of patients (about 95%) had a performance status score of 0 or 1.  The 
disease characteristics were well balanced in the WT group, with only a slight difference in ECOG status 
favouring the P+FX arm.  In contrast, in the MK group, a few factors showed an imbalance consistent 
with less disease burden in the FX group with less metastatic sites, and lower LDH and CEA levels.

Numbers analysed 
Out of 1378 patients screened, 1183 patients were randomised and included in the ITT Analysis Set; 
593 were randomized to panitumumab plus FOLFOX and 590 to FOLFOX alone. 
Most patients (93%) were evaluable for KRAS status (KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set): 55% of patients had 
wild-type  KRAS  tumours  (Wild-type  KRAS  Efficacy  Analysis  Set)  and  37%  had  mutant  KRAS  tumours 
(Mutant  KRAS  Efficacy  Analysis  Set).    The  most  common  reasons  for  unevaluable  KRAS  status  were 
lack of a sample available for testing and no tumour in specimen.

Finally,  Patients  Reported  Outcomes  (PRO)  were  assessed  every  4  weeks  while  patients  were  on 
treatment.  Approximately two-thirds of expected assessments were collected.  Quality of life was not 
significantly  affected  by  treatment  with  panitumumab.    Numerically,  the  results  were  in  favour  of 
FOLFOX alone (data not shown). 
Ancillary analyses 
The MAH submitted a large number of ancillary analyses (data not shown). 
Study 20050181 (2nd line) 
This  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  open-label,  comparative  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI chemotherapy (irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin) relative 
to FOLFIRI alone in patients with previously treated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. 
Methods 
Except  for  previous  and  concomitant  therapy,  and  the  stratification  factors,  the  design  and  study 
population of this study were the same as those of study 20050203. 
Study Participants 
As  this  was  a  study  of  second-line  treatment,  patients  should  have  previously  received  one  prior 
chemotherapy  regimen  consisting  of  first-line  fluoropyrimidine-based  chemotherapy  (excluding 
irinotecan)  but  this  should  have  been  stopped  for  at  least  30  days  before  randomisation.  Disease 
progression either while receiving or ≤ 6 months after the last dose of prior first-line therapy was to be 
radiographically documented per modified RECIST criteria. 
Treatments 
FOLFIRI  chemotherapy  was  administered  on  Day  1  of  each  treatment  cycle  at  the  following  starting 
doses:  irinotecan  180  mg/m2,  leucovorin  400  mg/m2  racemate  (or  200  mg/m2  l-LV),  5-FU  bolus  400 
mg/m2, 5-FU infusion 2400 mg/m2. 
Objectives 
The objective was to investigate and assess the treatment effect of panitumumab plus FOLFIRI on OS 
and/or PFS in patients receiving panitumumab plus FOLFIRI vs. FOLFIRI alone in the Wild-type KRAS 
Efficacy Analysis Set (primary goal) and in the Mutant KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set (secondary goal). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
PFS and OS were co-primary endpoints. 
Sample size 
The  study  was  initially  estimated  to  require  1100  patients  to  investigate  the  treatment  effect  on  OS 
and/or PFS in the intention-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set. Based on evidence from previous trials strongly 
suggesting that any clinically meaningful benefit of anti-EGFR therapy is limited to patients with wild-
type  KRAS  tumours,  the  goal  of  the  sample  size  considerations  was  to  ensure  adequate  power  to 
demonstrate  an  improvement  in  OS  and/or  PFS  among  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  tumours. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 21/69
 
 
 
 
   
 
Although patient follow-up time was lengthened, the original sample size goal was considered sufficient 
and was therefore not revised. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation was stratified by prior oxaliplatin exposure, prior bevacizumab exposure, and ECOG 
performance status. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study and central radiology review was used for tumour assessments, based on 
the same considerations as for study 20050203. 
Statistical methods 
The two co-primary endpoints, PFS and OS, were analysed independently using a p-value of 0.01 and 
0.04, respectively.  Comparisons using the mutant KRAS efficacy analysis set were contingent on first 
demonstrating a significant difference in the Wild-type population. 
The timing of the primary analyses of OS and PFS were event-driven based on the target OS and PFS 
event  goal  within  the  Wild-type  KRAS  Efficacy  Analysis  Set  (380  events  for  both  OS  and  PFS).  To 
preserve  trial  integrity,  although  the  analysis  of PFS  proceeded  regardless  of  the  OS  outcome, it  was 
not performed until the earlier of a positive interim OS analysis or the primary OS analysis. 
Results  
Participant flow 
Out of 1345 patients screened, 1186 were enrolled into this study and included in the ITT analysis set; 
591  patients  were  randomized  to  panitumumab  plus  FOLFIRI  and  595  were  randomized  to  FOLFIRI 
alone. 
Almost  all  patients  (98%)  had  stopped  treatment  at  the  cut-off  date  of  30  April  2009.    The  median 
duration of follow-up was around 40-45 weeks in the MK group and in the FOLFIRI alone (FI) arm of 
the WT group; it was longer in the Panitumumab + FOLFIRI (P+FI) arm of the WT group (58 weeks). 
The  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  of  FOLFIRI  was  disease  progression  per  investigator 
assessment,  which  was  slightly  more  frequent  in  the  MK  group  (66%)  than  in  the  WT  group  (59%).  
There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  treatment  arms  for  the  various  reasons  for 
discontinuation. 
There  were  more  patients  with  important  protocol  deviations  in  the  P+FI  arm  (50%)  than  in  the  FI 
alone  arm  (44%).    The  most  common  deviations  were  “other  treatment  compliance”  (e.g.  incorrect 
doses  of  chemotherapy  or  dosing  in  spite  of  neutropenia)  and  “entry/eligibility”.    Protocol  deviations 
regarding  patient  eligibility  included  absence  or  more  than  one  prior  chemotherapy  (3%),  absence  of 
radiographically  documented  progressive  disease  (6%)  or  randomisation  within  30  days  of  the  last 
dose of chemotherapy (15%), as well as non compliance to chemotherapy or off-schedule scans. 
Recruitment 
The  first  patient  was  enrolled  on  30  June  2006  and  the  last  patient  was  enrolled  on  13  March  2008. 
Data  cut-off  date  was  08  April  2008  for  the  PFS  analysis  and  30  April  2009  for  the  OS  and  response 
analysis.

Conduct of the study 
As  mentioned  before  for  study  20050203,  the  protocol  and  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  for  study 
20050181  was  amended  such  that  the  treatment  effect  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy  could  be  prospectively  analysed  by  tumour  KRAS  status.  The  initial  study  protocol, 
dated  29  November  2005  was  amended  twice  (on  09  March  2006  and  04  April  2008).  Amendment 1 
occurred  before  any  patients  were  enrolled,  and  amendment  2  occurred  after  all  patients  were 
enrolled. With the second amendment, the primary objective of this study was amended to incorporate 
analysis by KRAS status. 
Baseline data 
The ratio of patients enrolled from Western Europe, Australia and USA versus the rest of the world was 
61:39  in  both  treatment  arms.    Most  patients  were  male  (61%)  and  Caucasian  (96%).    The  median 
age  was  61  years  with  7%  of  the  patients  being  ≥  75  years.    The  demographic  characteristics  were 
well balanced between treatment arms in the WT.  In the MK group, there were notably less patients ≥ 
65 years in the P+FI arm (36%) than in the FI arm (45%). 
Disease characteristics are summarised in Tables 8 & 9.  They were well balanced in the WT group; in 
the MK group, there were more patients with ≥ 3 metastatic sites in the P+FI arm (52% vs. 47%).

Table 9: Main baseline characteristics (Mutant KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set, Study 20050181) 
The  two  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  prior  surgical  resections  (83-87%)  and 
radiotherapy (16%-20%). 
In  the  WT  group,  prior  chemotherapy  in  the  P+FI  and  FI  included  fluorouracil  (74%  vs.  71%),  folinic 
acid  (55%  vs.  50%),  oxaliplatin  (67%  vs.  65%),  bevacizumab  (18%  vs.  20%).  The  median  time  to 
progression  on  prior  therapy  was  6.7  months  (95%  CI:  6.2,  7.4)  in  the  P+FI  arm  and  7.1  months 
(95% CI: 6.4, 7.8) in the FI arm. 
In  the  MK  group,  prior  chemotherapy  in  the  P+FI  and  FI  included  fluorouracil  (73%  vs.  64%),  folinic 
acid (54% vs. 46%), oxaliplatin (69% vs. 68%) and bevacizumab (19% vs. 17%). The median time to 
progression  on  prior  therapy  was  6.9  months  (95%  CI:  6.3,  8.0)  in  the  P+FI  arm  and  6.7  months 
(95% CI: 5.9, 7.4) in the FI arm.

Numbers analysed 
Out of 1345 patients screened, 1186 were enrolled into this study and included in the ITT analysis set; 
591  patients  were  randomized  to  panitumumab  plus  FOLFIRI  and  595  were  randomized  to  FOLFIRI 
alone. Most patients (91%) were evaluable for KRAS status.  The most frequent reasons that patients 
were not evaluable were lack of tumour in the specimen or insufficient quality of DNA recovered from 
the specimen for testing.  Similar percentages of  patients in the panitumumab plus FOLFIRI arm and 
FOLFIRI alone arm had wild-type KRAS tumours (51% and 49%) or mutant KRAS tumours (40% and 
42%).

With  regard  to  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  (PROs),  quality  of  life  was  not  significantly  affected  by 
treatment  with  panitumumab  and  numerically,  the  results  were  in  favour  of  FOLFIRI  alone  (data  not 
shown).    In  the  WT  group,  this  result  is  supported  by  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  with  a 
deterioration of their performance according to their ECOG score in the P+FI arm (47%) than in the FI 
arm (37%). 
Ancillary analyses 
The MAH submitted a large number of ancillary analyses (data not shown). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled analysis of the two pivotal trials (20050203, 20050181) described above and of three phase 
II  single  arm  studies  (20060314,  20060277  and  20050184)  is  presented  under  supportive  studies 
below. 
Predictive and prognostic values of EGFR and KRAS biomarkers 
To  be  eligible  for  studies  20050203  and  20050181,  patients  were  required  to  have  a  paraffin-
embedded  tumour  tissue  from  the  primary  tumour  or  metastasis  available  for  central  biomarker 
testing;  however,  patient  eligibility  criteria  were  unselected  for  EGFR  expression.    To  evaluate  the 
potential  effect  of  EGFR  staining  parameters  on  efficacy  endpoints,  multivariate  models  were  used  to 
explore  the  predictive  value  of  the  various  EGFR  staining  parameters  for  PFS,  OS,  and  objective 
response rate among patients with wild-type KRAS tumour status.  These parameters included levels of 
EGFR  membrane  and  cytoplasmic  staining  intensity  (0,  1+,  2+,  3+),  and  extent  of  EGFR  membrane 
and cytoplasmic staining (percentage of cells). 
Among patients who were evaluable for EGFR, no EGFR parameter was identified as having predictive 
value on efficacy endpoints of PFS, OS, or objective response rate in either study (data not shown). 
Analyses  to  explore  the  predictive  effect  of  KRAS  mutation  status  on  efficacy  outcomes  were 
performed.  The results for the primary analysis of the quantitative interaction test in Study 20050203 
indicated a significant interaction between treatment and KRAS status for PFS (p = 0.0083), which was 
confirmed in sensitivity analyses.  The predictive value of KRAS status was significant for OS, as well, 
but no predictive value was found for response rate (data not shown). 
The  clinical  utility  of  KRAS  was  not  statistically  demonstrated  in  Study  20050181.    No  significant 
interaction was observed between treatment and KRAS status for PFS (data not shown).   
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were submitted. 
Supportive studies 
Three phase II single arm studies (20060314, 20060277 and 20050184) are supportive of the efficacy 
of panitumumab in patients with wild-type KRAS mCRC (see Table 13).  Study 20060314 was designed 
to provide data on the safety and efficacy of panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI in patients not 
previously  treated  for  mCRC  (first-line).    Study  20060277  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  panitumumab  plus  FOLFIRI  in  patients  who  had  received  one  prior  regimen  (including 
bevacizumab)  for  mCRC.    Study  20050184,  which  combined  panitumumab  plus  irinotecan-containing 
regimens  as  second-line  therapy,  was  performed  to  determine  if  pre-emptive  skin  therapy  could 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 30/69
 
 
 
   
 
mitigate the dermatological toxicity known to be associated with anti-EGFR therapy.  As in the phase 
III studies, these studies have enrolled patients unselected for KRAS status. 
A  descriptive  summary  of  results  across  the  5  studies  was  presented  by  the  MAH.    A  total  of  2733 
patients were enrolled in the first-line setting (n = 1337) or second-line setting (n = 1396).  91% to 
95% of patients across studies were evaluable for KRAS status.  Similar percentages of patients across 
studies  and  treatment  arms  had  wild-type  KRAS  tumours  (49%  to  56%)  or  mutant  KRAS  tumours 
(39% to 42%). 
Across  all  5 studies,  approximately  two-thirds  of  patients  had  colon  cancer  and  approximately  one-
third  had  rectal  cancer  (which  reflects  the  distribution  of  CRC  in  the  general  population),  and  most 
were men (54-66%) and white (76-98%).  Patient age ranged from 21 to 86 years with little variation 
between studies; median age ranged from 59.0 to 65.5 years. 
A summary of ORR, PFS and OS results in patients with WT tumours is presented in Table 13.

3.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  two  phase  III  studies  (20050203,  20050181)  were  randomised  and  controlled,  the  sample  size 
was acceptably large and the statistical methods employed were deemed appropriate.  Given the well-
known  skin-related  toxicities  of  panitumumab,  the  open-label  design  of  the  two  pivotal  studies  is 
considered  acceptable.  The  study  protocols  of  both  studies  were  amended  twice  but  for  both  studies 
the study integrity was preserved since the changes were motivated by data external to the trials, and 
they  were  implemented  after  full  enrolment  and  before  any  efficacy  analysis  and  determination  of 
KRAS status was performed. 
In  both  studies,  there  was  a  high  rate  of  treatments  ended  due  to  ‘subject  request’.  This  potentially 
covers  various  motives  in  reality,  including  adverse  events  and  disease  progression,  but  patients 
withdrawing  due  to  own  request  were  not  reclassified  according  to  information  in  the  narratives,  so 
that the analysis of treatment discontinuations cannot be considered accurate and reliable. 
In study 20050203, there were slightly more patients with protocol deviations considered important as 
per protocol, i.e. thought to potentially impact the patient's safety or statistical analysis conclusions, in 
the  P+FX  arm  (44%)  than  in  the  FX  alone  group  (39%).    The  most  common  were  “other  treatment 
compliance”, e.g. chemotherapy not per protocol (14%) or dosing in spite of neutropenia (33%), and 
“off-schedule  study  procedures”  (13%).    The  rate  of  important  protocol  deviations  is  considered  high 
with  notable  differences  between  countries/regions  although  the  rate  of  the  most  severe  protocol 
violations seems acceptable (<10%). 
Similarly,  in  study  20050181,  protocol  deviations  regarding  patient  eligibility,  e.g.  absence  or  more 
than one prior chemotherapy (3%), absence of radiographically documented progressive disease (6%) 
or randomisation within 30 days of the last dose of chemotherapy (15%), as well as non compliance to 
chemotherapy or off-schedule scans, raised concerns about the GCP compliance of the study and led to 
the GCP inspection mentioned before. 
In patients with WT tumours 
Both phase III studies demonstrated a statistically significant but modest increase in PFS as reflected 
by a small absolute difference in median survival (1.4 - 1.8 months) and hazard ratios around 0.80 in 
the most mature analyses. 
In  the  primary  analysis  of  the  first  line  study  (20050203),  the  addition  of  panitumumab  to  FOLFOX 
resulted  in  a  modest  increase  in  PFS  (the  primary  endpoint)  with  an  absolute  difference  in  median 
survival of 1.6 months and an HR of 0.80 (0.66, 0.97), which was statistically significant (p = 0.023).  
The investigator assessment of PFS was in good agreement with the independent assessment with no 
signs of relevant bias and might give a better estimate of efficacy than the central assessment due to 
informative  censoring  in  the  latter  analysis;  it  showed  an  even  smaller  benefit  of  only  1.2  months 
(primary analysis, data not shown).   
In  the  primary  analysis  of  the  second  line  study  (20050181),  with  the  addition  of  panitumumab  to 
FOLFIRI, a modest increase in PFS was shown as reflected by an absolute difference in median survival 
of  2.0  months  and  an  HR  of  0.73  (0.59,  0.90),  which  was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.004).  
However,  in  the  latest  PFS  analysis,  the  difference  appeared  smaller  and  much  less  significant 
(absolute  difference  in  median  survival  of  1.8  months;  HR  =  0.82  (0.69,  0.97);  p  =  0.023),  to  the 
point that it becomes borderline to the p<0.01 threshold required in the primary analysis to preserve 
an overall 5% type I error.  Therefore, the evidence of longer PFS cannot be considered as robust.  The 
PFS analysis according to investigator assessment showed an absolute difference in median survival of 
0.6  months  at  the  primary  analysis  and  1.7  months  in  a  later  analysis;  results  showed  good 
concordance between investigator and central assessment (data not shown).

In  both  studies  and  in  sensitivity  analyses,  PFS  results  were  robust  to  the  type  of  population  and 
analysis chosen. 
In terms of OS, although both studies showed a trend favourable to the addition of panitumumab, it is 
questionable whether the survival difference observed is not due to chance and is clinically meaningful. 
In the FOLFOX study (20050203) a favourable trend (albeit not statistically significant) was shown on 
OS  with  Kaplan-Meier  curves  starting  to  separate  after  1  year.    The  absolute  difference  in  median 
survival of about 4 months is difficult to understand on the basis of the PFS results. In the second line 
FOLFIRI  study  (20050181),  the  same  absolute  difference  in  median  survival  of  2.0  months  was 
observed in the primary analysis for both PFS and OS, the co-primary endpoint of the study in 2nd line 
treatment.    Actually,  Kaplan-Meier  curves  were  separated  only  between  6  and  20  months  and  the 
difference  did  not  reach  significance  (HR  =  0.85;  0.70,  1.04  –  p  =  0.12).    The  MAH  argued  that  the 
difference in OS was small due to more patients in the FOLFIRI arm receiving anti-EGFR therapies after 
disease  progression  (31%  vs.  10%),  but  sensitivity  analyses  were  not  able  to  support  this  argument 
(see Table 11).   
The objective tumour response to panitumumab was initially marginal in first-line treatment (55% vs. 
48%) but increased slightly in the final analysis (57% vs. 48%); it was highly significant in second-line 
treatment (35% vs. 10%).  The clinical relevance of response rate in this disease setting has not been 
established for this type of agent. 
In the first-line study with FOLFOX, the findings lack internal consistency insofar as PFS and OS results 
in  the  WT  subgroup  are  entirely  driven  by  the  ROW  population,  i.e.  Central-Eastern  Europe,  Latin 
America,  and  South  Africa.    The  difference  between  Kaplan-Meier  curves  in  the  Western-
Europe/Canada/Australia  region  is  marginal  for  PFS  and  nonexistent  for  OS,  with  even  a  higher 
mortality with panitumumab up to 15 months.  This might partly be explained by an incidence of post-
progression anti-EGFR therapy that was 3 times higher in the FOLFOX alone arm (27%) compared with 
the panitumumab plus FOLFOX arm (9%) while it was low and similar between arms (6%) for patients 
enrolled in the ROW region. 
Similarly, there was no evidence of benefit (neither PFS, nor OS) in patients older than 75 years (HR 
for both PFS and OS greater than 1 in favour of FOLFOX alone) with a higher number of deaths (67%) 
in the panitumumab + FOLFOX arm than in the FOLFOX arm (57%) in the primary analysis.  Even in 
the  large  subgroup  of  patients  ≥  65  years,  the  HR  point  estimate  for  the  PFS  was  1.0  with  no 
difference in ORR (46% in both treatment arms).  Likewise, adding panitumumab to FOLFOX appeared 
harmful  in  the  small  subgroup  of  patients  with  ECOG  score  of  2,  where  significantly  shortened  PFS 
(median 4.8 vs. 7.6 months; HR = 2.30; p = 0.03) and OS (median 7.0 vs. 11.7 months; HR = 1.83; 
p = 0.09) were observed togeher with increased toxicity. 
In the subgroup analyses of the second line study with FOLFIRI, the positive effect of panitumumab on 
PFS  and  OS  appeared  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  worse  prognosis  as  reflected  by  prior 
oxaliplatin  treatment  and  high  baseline  LDH  levels.    In  addition,  the  effect  on  ORR  and  PFS  did  not 
seem to diminish with older age as it did in the FOLFOX study, although the HR point estimate for OS 
was 1.05 in the few patients older than 75 years.  However, even in the largest group of patients aged 
< 65 years, an apparent benefit in PFS (HR=0.69) did not translate into clear OS benefit (HR = 0.92).  
Also, in contrast with the other study, the positive effects of panitumumab appeared more pronounced 
in  the  Western  Europe/Australia/US  region  than in the  ROW  region  (i.e.  Central-Eastern  Europe),  but 
the results were still broadly comparable. 
At the time of the conditional approval of Vectibix, the CHMP stated that the clinical efficacy was small 
on the basis of a small increase in PFS.  Moreover, measures of overall Quality of Life did not indicate 
that panitumumab had a clear positive impact on Quality of Life.  Therefore, additional data on Quality 
of  Life  using  a  validated  scale  were  requested  as  Specific  Obligations  (SOB  06,  10).    The  various 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 33/69
 
 
 
   
 
analyses of QoL data did not show any benefit of adding panitumumab but rather a numerical trend in 
favour of chemotherapy alone (data not shown). 
In patients with MK tumours 
With  the  combination  of  panitumumab  with  FOLFOX,  a  deleterious  impact  was  observed  on  time  to 
progression, PFS (absolute difference in median survival of 1.5 months; HR of 1.29 (1.04, 1.62); p = 
0.023), and OS (absolute difference in median survival of about 4 months; HR = 1.24 (0.98, 1.57; p = 
0.069).  Of note in the interim analysis, this difference was highly significant (p = 0.003).  In contrast 
to the curves in the WT group, the Kaplan-Meier curves of OS separated from the start of the trial and 
this  finding  was  consistent  in  both  geographic  regions.  The  absence  of  objective  tumour  response  to 
panitumumab  was  expected  but  a  clear  negative  effect  on  time  to  progression,  PFS  and  OS  when  it 
was combined with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy remains an unexplained finding.  This is considered 
a  major  concern  since  the  proportion  of  patients  with  KRAS  mutations  potentially  treated  with 
panitumumab  is  unknown  and  very  difficult  to  estimate.    The  reasons  for  such  wrong  treatments  are 
multiple  and  include  non  evaluable  test  results,  unreliable  test  methods,  or  mutations  not  detectable 
by the test used. 
In  contrast,  the  combination  of  panitumumab  with  FOLFIRI  does  not  appear  harmful,  and  thus,  this 
negative effect seems to be specific to the combination with oxaliplatin chemotherapy.  
Predictive value of biomarkers in overall population 
Overall,  KRAS  status  was  not  consistently  shown  to  be  prognostic  for  PFS  or  OS  in  both  studies. 
However,  analyses  to  explore  the  predictive  effect  of  KRAS  mutation  status  on  efficacy  outcomes  in 
FOLFOX study 20050203 indicated a significant interaction between treatment and KRAS status for PFS 
and  OS  but  not  for  response  rate.  This  result  is  consistent  with  overall  results  for  PFS  in  this  study, 
which significantly favoured the panitumumab plus chemotherapy arm in patients with wild-type KRAS 
tumours,  but  showed  a  negative  effect  in  the  panitumumab  plus  chemotherapy  arm  of  patients  with 
mutant KRAS tumours that also reached statistical significance.   
The  clinical  utility  of  KRAS  was  not  statistically  demonstrated  in  Study  20050181.    No  significant 
interaction  was  observed  between  treatment  and  KRAS  status  for  PFS.  The  lack  of  significance  was 
expected,  since  the  interaction  test  had  low  power  for  the  observed  magnitude  of  variability  in  PFS 
treatment  effects  between  the  KRAS  subgroups.    Pre-conditions  for  an  OS  interaction  test  were  not 
met,  although  descriptive  analysis  results  were  similar  to  those  for  PFS.    A  planned  descriptive 
interaction  test  for  objective  response  achieved  nominal  significance,  where  a  large  treatment  effect 
was essentially confined to the wild-type KRAS subgroup.  
Both  studies  confirmed  that  a  positive  objective  response  to  panitumumab  was  mainly  confined  to 
wild-type KRAS tumours while no objective response was seen in tumours with mutations.  However, 
while a positive effect was observed on disease progression in patients with WT tumours, inconsistent 
effects  were  seen  in  patients  with  MK  tumours:  either  neutral  (on  the  positive  side)  with  FOLFIRI  or 
clearly negative with FOLFOX.  It should also be remembered that the positive effect of panitumumab 
in  patients  with  WT  tumours  was  abrogated  when  it  was  combined  with  chemotherapy  and 
bevacizumab.  Moreover  and  given  that  KRAS  determination  is  critical  for  the  indication  of 
panitumumab,  the  small  benefit  in  wild-type  KRAS  tumours  observed  in  phase  III  trials  where  KRAS 
status was centrally diagnosed cannot be generalised to a broad clinical setting, where the reliability of 
KRAS  diagnosis  has  not  yet  been  established.  Taken  together,  these  results still  do  not  provide  a  full 
understanding of the predictive value of KRAS testing. 
Among patients who were evaluable for EGFR, no EGFR parameter was identified as having predictive 
value  on  efficacy  endpoints  of  PFS,  OS,  or  objective  response  rate  in  either  study.    Based  on  these 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 34/69
 
 
 
   
 
results,  the  MAH  argued  that  the  wording  “EGFR  expressing”  should  be  removed  from  the  current 
monotherapy indication. 
Many  technical  reasons  have  been  advocated  for  the  lack  of  association  between  EGFR  detection  by 
immunochemistry  and  response  to  EGFR-targeted  treatment.    More  recently,  tumours  with  an 
increased EGFR gene copy number as assessed by FISH or CISH have been shown to be dependent on 
the  EGFR  pathway  for  their  survival  and  growth.    There  is  some  evidence  that  normal  diploid  EGFR 
gene  copy  number  may  predict  tumour  resistance  to  EGFR-targeted  treatment.    Therefore,  the 
absence of predictive value on efficacy endpoints is highly dependent on the method used and is only 
relevant to IHC staining.  Furthermore, even if the analyses from the combination studies indicate that 
EGFR  expression  is  not  predictive  of  efficacy it is  not  obvious  that  this  would  necessarily  be  the  case 
with panitumumab as later line monotherapy. 
Finally, the small effect of anti-EGFR therapies on wild-type KRAS tumours is not surprising since it is 
now known that a number of other mutations in the EGFR signalling pathway may confer resistance to 
these  therapies.    Other  biomarkers  such  as  BRAF,  PIK3CA/PTEN,  or  NRAS  but  also  EGFR  gene  copy 
number, EGFR ligands (epiregulin and amphiregulin), single nucleotide polymorphisms in codon 497 of 
EGFR, or levels of EGFR downstream signalling phosphoproteins (e.g. pMEK1, pP70S6K) may increase 
the predictive power for response to treatment and are awaiting validation in clinical trials. 
3.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  two  pivotal  studies  do  not  show  robust  evidence  of  benefit  for  the  addition  of  panitumumab  to 
oxaliplatin-  or  irinotecan-based  chemotherapies  in  the  treatment  of  wild-type  KRAS  tumours.  
Furthermore,  the  harmful  effect  of  the  combination  with  oxaliplatin  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS 
tumours is a major concern. 
3.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The main safety analysis was conducted on the patients with mCRC: 
  who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with/without panitumumab in Study 20050203 
 
and those who received irinotecan-based chemotherapy with/without panitumumab in Studies 
20050181, 20050184, 20060277, and 20060314. 
The analyses sets (according to treatment received) are shown below. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 35/69
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
Exposure  to  panitumumab  and  oxaliplatin  or  irinotecan  chemotherapy  in  the  phase  III  trials  is 
presented in Table 14. 
Extent  of  exposure  to  panitumumab: Compared  with  patients  in  the  Irinotecan  group,  patients  in  the 
Oxaliplatin  group  had  a  higher  cumulative  dose  of  panitumumab  delivered,  longer  duration  of 
treatment, and more infusions per patient.  
Extent  of  exposure  to  chemotherapy:  There  were  no  notable  differences  between  the  panitumumab 
and no-panitumumab groups for oxaliplatin but the median treatment duration and cumulative dose of 
irinotecan were lower in the no-panitumumab treatment arm compared to the panitumumab treatment 
arm. 
Doses  withheld,  delayed  or  changed:  In  study  2005203,  7%  of  the  planned  panitumumab  infusions 
were withheld, and 40% of patients had at least 1 panitumumab infusion withheld.  The most common 
reason was an adverse event (36%). 
As  for  the  studies  with  FOLFIRI,  6%  of  the  planned  panitumumab  infusions  were  withheld  in  study 
20050181 (8% in the All-Panitumumab group), and 33% of patients (Study 20050181) had at least 1 
panitumumab infusion withheld (45% in the All-Panitumumab group).  The most common reason was 
an adverse event. 
The  percentages  of  chemotherapy  doses  withheld,  delayed  or  changed  were  usually  higher  when 
combined with panitumumab, e.g. 20% vs. 16% of irinotecan doses delayed or 12% vs. 9% of doses 
of oxaliplatin withheld.

Table 14 
Summary of exposure to panitumumab and chemotherapy 
Adverse events  
Combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy 
Nearly all patients in both treatment arms of Study 20050203 experienced adverse events (AEs) (Table 
15).    Compared  with  FOLFOX  alone,  the  addition  of  panitumumab  to  FOLFOX  resulted  in  increased 
patient  incidence  of  grade  ≥  3  AEs  (88%  vs.  76%),  grade  ≥  4  AEs  (32%  vs.  25%),  serious  adverse 
events  (SAEs)  (45%  vs.  34%),  AEs  causing  permanent  discontinuation  of  any  study  drug 
(chemotherapy and/or panitumumab) (23% and 14%) and fatal adverse events (7% vs. 5%). 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 37/69
 
 
 
 
   
 
The  summary  of  high-level  adverse  events  (grade  ≥ 3,  serious,  leading  to  discontinuation)  was 
generally  similar  between  the  wild-type  KRAS  and  the  mutant  KRAS  Safety  Analysis  Set,  with  the 
exception  of a  greater  difference  between  treatment arms in  serious  adverse  events  in the  MK  group 
(47%  vs.  30%)  compared  with  the  WT  group  (42%  vs.  36%).    In  addition,  the  incidence  of  fatal 
adverse events in the P+FX arm was higher than in the FX arm among patients in the MK group (8% 
vs. 3%) compared to the WT group (5% vs. 6%). 
Table 15  Summary of Adverse Events (Oxaliplatin Safety Analysis Set) 
a Adverse events were coded using the MedDRA dictionary V12. Severity graded using the CTCAE v3.0, with the 
exception of some dermatology/skin adverse events that were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 3.0 with modifications. 
The  majority  of  most  frequent  adverse  events  have  been  previously  recognized  for  panitumumab  as 
listed in the current SmPC: 
 
 
 
 
diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, 
rash, dermatitis acneiform, pruritis, dry skin, paronychia, 
stomatitis, mucosal inflammation, 
pyrexia, fatigue, 
  hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia. 
Most of the events occurring at a > 5% higher incidence in the panitumumab arm were consistent with 
the known safety profile of panitumumab: 
 
 
diarrhoea, 
rash, dermatitis acneiform, pruritus, dry skin, nail disorder, paronychia, erythema, skin fissure, 
acne, alopecia, 
  mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, 
 
 
 
dehydration, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, 
conjunctivitis, 
dyspnoea, epistaxis. 
Adverse events with a ≥ 5% difference between the treatment arms that were not previously reported 
in the monotherapy setting include Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome, anorexia, and 
decreased weight. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 38/69
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
PPE has been recently added as common in the SmPC based on these results as reported in a 
previous PSUR. 
  Anorexia  was  reported  with  a  higher  patient  incidence  in  the  panitumumab  arm  compared  to 
the no-panitumumab arm (35% compared to 23%).  Only 2% of the events of anorexia in the 
panitumumab arm were  serious compared to < 1% in the no-panitumumab arm, and in both 
arms, < 1% of patients discontinued due to anorexia. 
  Decreased  weight  was  reported  with  a  patient  incidence  of  17%  in  the  panitumumab  arm 
compared  to  7%  in  the  no-panitumumab  arm.    It  was  reported  as  serious  in  <  1%  of  the 
patients  in  the  panitumumab  arm  compared  to  0%  in  the  no-panitumumab  arm.    The  worst 
grade  reported  was  grade 3.    In  both  arms,  the  event  of  decreased  weight  led  to 
discontinuation in < 1% of patients. 
The MAH proposed to add these last 2 AEs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Hypokalaemia  appeared  to  be  more  pronounced  in  patients  receiving  panitumumab  than  in  those 
receiving  chemotherapy  alone.    It  was  reported  with  a  higher  patient  incidence  in  the  panitumumab 
arm  compared  to  the  no-panitumumab  arm  (20% versus  13%).    Very  few  events  of  hypokalaemia 
were  serious  (1%  in  the  panitumumab  arm  and  0%  in  the  no-panitumumab  arm)  but  one  in  the 
panitumumab arm was fatal.  No patient in either arm discontinued treatment due to hypokalaemia. 
A  comparison  of  the  patient  incidence  rates  of  neutropenia  and  thrombocytopenia,  paraesthesia, 
nausea  and  vomiting,  which  all  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  FX  alone  arm,  did  not  suggest  any 
impact of add-on panitumumab on haematological and neurological toxicities as well as emesis induced 
by chemotherapy. 
Combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy 
Nearly all patients in both treatment arms of Study 20050181 experienced adverse events (Table 16). 
Compared  with  FOLFIRI  alone,  the  addition  of  panitumumab  to  FOLFIRI  resulted  in  increased  patient 
incidence  of  grade  ≥  3  AEs  (75%  vs.  56%),  grade  ≥  4  AEs  (24%  vs.  21%),  serious  adverse  events 
(SAEs)  (40%  vs.  29%),  AEs  causing  permanent  discontinuation  of  any  study  drug  (chemotherapy 
and/or panitumumab) (21% and 11%) and fatal adverse events (6% vs. 5%). 
The  summary  of  high-level  adverse  events  (grade  ≥ 3,  serious,  leading  to  discontinuation)  was 
generally similar between the wild-type KRAS and the mutant KRAS Safety Analysis Set. 
Table 16  Summary of Adverse Events (Irinotecan Safety Analysis Set) 
a Adverse events were coded using the MedDRA dictionary V12. Severity graded using the CTCAE v3.0, with the 
exception of some dermatology/skin adverse events that were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events version 3.0 with modifications.

Amongst the most frequent adverse events in the panitumumab arm (Study 20050181), only anorexia 
was  not  listed  in  the  current  SmPC.    Importantly,  events  of  neutropenia  and  vomiting  were  equally 
frequent in both treatment arms.  As with oxaliplatin, newly identified risks for panitumumab included 
PPE, anorexia, and decreased weight. 
Grade 3/4 Adverse Events 
Combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy 
Overall,  the  patient  incidence  of  grade  3/4  adverse  events  was  higher  in  the  panitumumab  arm 
compared to the no-panitumumab arm (87% versus 76%).  Grade 3/4 AEs that were more common 
(at least 5% difference) in panitumumab-treated patients were: 
 
 
diarrhoea (18% vs. 9%) 
rash and dermatitis acneiform (respectively 15% and 9% vs. 0%) 
  hypokalaemia (9% vs. 4%) 
 
fatigue (10% vs. 3% in the WT group) 
  hypomagnesaemia (6% vs. 0%) 
 
dehydration (6% vs. 0% in the MK group). 
In  contrast,  the  patient  incidence  of  neutropenia,  the  most  frequent  grade  3/4  AE,  was  higher  in  the 
no-panitumumab arm of the MK group (46% vs. 35%). 
Combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy 
Overall,  the  patient  incidence  of  grade  3/4  adverse  events  was  higher  in  the  panitumumab  arm 
compared to the no-panitumumab arm of the phase III trial (74% versus 55%).  Grade 3/4 AEs that 
were more common in panitumumab-treated patients were: 
 
 
rash and dermatitis acneiform (respectively 17% and 8% vs. 0%) 
diarrhoea (14% vs. 9%) 
  hypokalaemia (5% vs. <1%) 
  mucosal inflammation (7% vs. 2% in the MK group). 
The  patient  incidence  of  neutropenia,  the  most  frequent  grade  3/4  AE,  was  similar  in  both  treatment 
arms (19% in the panitumumab and 21% in the no-panitumumab arm). 
Adverse events of special interest 
These  include:  Cardiac  toxicity,  Diarrhoea,  Hypomagnesaemia,  Hypocalcaemia,  Impaired  or  delayed 
wound  healing,  Infusion  related  reactions,  Integument  toxicities,  Pulmonary  toxicity,  Stomatitis/oral 
mucositis, Vascular toxicity. 
Grade  ≥  3  AEs  of  interest  are  summarised  in  Tables  17  &  18.    Grade  ≥  3  events  of  skin  toxicity, 
stomatitis,  diarrhoea,  and  hypomagnesaemia  occurred  more  frequently  in  panitumumab-treated 
patients in both chemotherapy groups whereas pulmonary and cardiac toxicities occurred with similar 
patient  incidence  in  the  two  treatment  arms.    Grade  ≥  3  thromboembolic  events  occurred  more 
frequently in panitumumab-treated patients when combined to oxaliplatin. 
Skin  toxicities  specific  to  anti-EGFR  inhibitors  are  an  important  contributor  to  the  overall  increase  in 
severe  toxicities  of  the  combination  of  panitumumab  with  chemotherapy.    The  occurrence  of  severe 
(grade  3/4)  rash  and  acneiform  dermatitis  increased  with  treatment  duration:  in  study  20050203,  it 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 40/69
 
 
 
   
 
raised  from  5%  and  4%,  respectively,  in  patients  with  less  than  3  months  of  treatment  to  23%  and 
12%,  respectively,  in  those  with  more  than  9  months  of  treatment.    They  prompted  chemotherapy 
discontinuation in up to 3% of the cases and dose delays/adjustment in up to 16% of the patients. 
The occurrence of diarrhoea is greatly increased on combined therapy (up to 68%) in comparison with 
panitumumab  monotherapy  (21%  in  the  pivotal  trial).    Most  importantly,  it  is  also  substantially 
augmented,  including  the occurrence  of  the  most  severe  cases  (from  9%  up  to  14-18%)  and  serious 
cases (from 3-4% up to 10%; one fatal case in study 20050181), as compared to chemotherapy alone. 
Grade  ≥  3  infusion  reactions  occurred  at  a  similar  patient  incidence  in  the  two  treatment  arms 
regardless  of  the  definition  used  in  both  analysis  sets.    Of  note  however,  more  patients  received 
prophylactic medications when panitumumab was added to chemotherapy.  In total, there were three 
cases  of  life-threatening  reaction  in  the  two  phase  III  trials:  two  anaphylactic  reactions  and  one 
angioedema, which prompted discontinuation of therapy.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In  the  Oxaliplatin  Safety  Analysis  Set,  the  patient  incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  the 
panitumumab-treated arm compared with the no-panitumumab arm (45% versus 34%) with a greater 
difference  seen  in  the  mutant  KRAS  group  (47%  vs.  30%)  compared  to  the  wild-type  KRAS  group 
(42% vs. 36%).  No single event appeared to account for this difference.  Diarrhoea was the only SAE 
with a ≥5% greater incidence in the panitumumab arm (10%) compared to the no-panitumumab arm 
(3%); dehydration was also more frequent (3% vs. <1%, respectively). 
In  the  Irinotecan  Safety  Analysis  Set  of  study  20050181,  the  same  absolute  difference  was 
observed  with  40%  and  29%  of  patients  in  the  panitumumab  and  no-panitumumab  arms  reporting 
SAEs.    Unlike  with  oxaliplatin, incidences  were  similar  in  the  WT  and  MK  groups.    The  most  common 
serious  adverse  event  was  diarrhoea  (6%  vs.  4%  in  the  panitumumab  and  no-panitumumab  arms, 
respectively).

In the phase III trials, all deaths that occurred during treatment or within the safety follow-up period 
(generally  30 days  after  the  last  dose  of  any  study  treatment),  including  those  that  occurred  in  the 
setting of disease progression, were recorded as fatal adverse events (see Table 19).

In  both  trials,  there  was  a  small  excess  of  deaths  in  the  no-panitumumab  arms  of  the  WT  groups  as 
opposed  to  increased  on-treatment  mortality  in  the  panitumumab  arms  of  the  MK  groups.    With  the 
oxaliplatin combination, this difference was significant (HR = 2.58; 95%CI = 1.01, 6.23).  In the All-
panitumumab  group  combined  with irinotecan  (N=951 patients),  the  patient  incidence  of  fatal  events 
was similar (7%). 
The patient incidence of fatal AEs decreased with longer treatment duration; the excess of fatal events 
with  panitumumab  was  mainly  observed  with  treatments  less  than  3  months  while  no  difference 
between treatment arms was seen with treatments lasting more than 6 months. 
Most  fatal  events  were  disease  progression  or  a  direct  consequence  of  progression  of  the  underlying 
malignancy.  There were few deaths from other causes that occurred in more than a single patient in 
the panitumumab arm of study 20050203; however, it is acknowledged that cause of death in terminal 
cancer  patients  is  very  much  open  to  interpretation.    No  obvious  pattern  of  deaths  emerged  in  the 
mutant  KRAS  group;  rather,  deaths  were  due  to  a  variety  of  causes, 
including  mCRC.  
Notwithstanding, these data alone cannot account for the clear difference in survival favouring the no-
panitumumab arm that was shown in the MK group of study 20050203. 
Laboratory findings 
Severe  (grade  ≥  3)  decreases  in  serum  magnesium,  calcium  and  potassium  were  observed  in  small 
percentages  (3-7%)  of  patients  on  chemotherapy  alone  but  in  2-3  times  more  patients  with 
panitumumab  (e.g.  11%  of  grade  ≥  3  decreases  in  magnesium).    These  figures  are  substantially 
higher than those of the corresponding AEs but the trends are consistent. 
As  expected,  the  patient  incidence  of  anti-panitumumab  antibodies  in  the  combination  chemotherapy 
setting  was  rare  and  similar  to  the  incidence  observed  in  the  monotherapy  setting,  with  1.8%  of 
patients developing binding antibodies and 0.2% neutralising antibodies. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
The rate of grade ≥ 3 AEs was similar between younger and older patients in the panitumumab arms in 
both the Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan Safety Analysis Sets.  However, serious adverse events and grade 
4/5  events  occurred  with  a  greater  frequency  in  older  patients.    As  an  example,  serious  AEs  were 
reported by 52% of the patients ≥ 65 years vs. 40% of the patients < 65 years with the combination 
of  panitumumab  and  oxaliplatin  whereas  in  the  oxaliplatin  arm  the  percentages  were  35%  vs.  33%, 
respectively. 
Likewise,  for  the  grade  ≥  3  AEs  of  interest,  the  differences  between  patients  older  and  younger  than 
65  years  were  modest  in  the  no-panitumumab  arms,  except  for  diarrhoea  in  the  trial  with  irinotecan 
(13% vs. 7%, respectively).  In contrast, the differences between patients older and younger than 65 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 43/69
 
  
 
 
   
 
years in the panitumumab arms were substantial for diarrhoea (21-23% vs. 14-15%), thromboembolic 
events  (13-14%  vs.  8-9%),  stomatitis/oral  mucositis  (10%  vs.  5-6%),  hypomagnesaemia  with 
irinotecan  (6%  vs.  3%),  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  pulmonary  toxicity  with 
oxaliplatin. 
Region 
In  the  Irinotecan  Safety  Analysis  Set  (study  20050181),  Grade  ≥  3  AEs,  in  both  panitumumab  and 
no-panitumumab arms, were reported  with a higher patient incidence among  patients in the Western 
Europe/Australia/US  region  compared  with  the  ROW  region  (by  15%-19%).    Likewise,  the  patient 
incidence of serious adverse events was 22%-25% higher in Western Europe/Australia/US region than 
in  the  ROW  region  (essentially  Central  and  Eastern  Europe).    The  MAH  argued  that  this  was  due  to 
‘regional and cultural differences’ although it is unclear why a similar finding was not observed in the 
other study, even in the countries where both studies were conducted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In both phase III trials, panitumumab increased the rate of discontinuation of chemotherapy and more 
than 20% patients stopped panitumumab and/or chemotherapy as shown below. 
Table 20: Discontinuations due to adverse events in studies 20050203 and  20050181 
The  most  common  events  leading  to  FOLFOX  discontinuation  were  (for  the  panitumumab, 
no-panitumumab  arms):  paraesthesia  (2%,  1%),  fatigue  (1%,  <  1%),  diarrhoea  (1%,  <  1%),  and 
hypersensitivity (1%, < 1%).  The most common events leading to panitumumab discontinuation were 
rash (4%) and dermatitis acneiform (2%). 
The  most  common  events  causing  FOLFIRI  discontinuation  in  study 20050181  were  (for  the 
panitumumab, no-panitumumab arms): diarrhoea (2%, < 1%), fatigue (2%, 1%), rash (2%, 0%), and 
asthenia (1%, 0%).  In the All-Panitumumab group, the most common events leading to panitumumab 
discontinuation were rash (4%), diarrhoea (2%), and dermatitis acneiform (1%). 
Post marketing experience 
As  of  30  September 2010,  panitumumab  has  been  approved  for  use  in  37  countries.    Cumulatively, 
since  the  inception  of  the  panitumumab  development  program,  an  estimated  54,126  patients  have 
been exposed to the product. 
During the latest reporting period (01 April 2010 to 30 September 2010), the MAH received a total of 
427  (296  in  the  previous  PSUR  period)  medically  confirmed  case  reports  describing  1095  (769  in  the 
previous PSUR period) adverse events. The majority of reports were from clinical trials. One hundred 
and  eighty-six  reports  (44%)  contained  unlisted  serious  reactions;  43  non-serious  reports  contained 
unlisted  reactions.  The  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  reactions  (preferred  terms)  were 
diarrhoea,  vomiting,  dehydration,  nausea  and  pyrexia,  which  are  listed  events.  The  most  frequently 
reported non-serious adverse reactions were rash and ‘skin toxicity’, which are listed events, and ‘skin

Page 44/69
 
 
 
 
   
 
reaction’,  which  is  an  unlisted  event.  Many  cases  were  confounded  by  underlying  disease  and 
concomitant chemotherapy. 
A  total  of  14  new  cases  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  were  received  including  eight  reports  of 
pulmonary  embolism,  six  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  one  of  thrombophlebitis.  Since  pulmonary 
embolism  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  associated  with  panitumumab,  it  is  probable  that,  although 
many cases are confounded, deep venous thromboembolism may also be causally associated with the 
drug. 
Moreover,  one  serious  case  of  keratitis  and  three  serious  cases  of  ulcerative  keratitis  have  been 
cumulatively  identified  in  patients  treated  with  panitumumab.    All  four  cases  were  reported  in  the 
spontaneous  setting.    Three  of  the  cases  were  reported  in  patients  who  were  administered 
panitumumab  in  the  monotherapy  setting  and  one  case  was  reported  in  a  patient  who  received 
Vectibix  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  Taken  together,  a  review  of  the  cases  of  ulcerative 
keratitis and keratitis, biologic plausibility (integument and eye toxicity with the administration of EGFR 
inhibitors), and possible class effect (both ulcerative keratitis and keratitis are listed events in package 
inserts  for  other  EGFR  inhibitors),  provide  evidence  to  suggest  a  casual  drug  event  association  for 
panitumumab and these events.  
Of note in the FOLFIRI trial are 5 cases of  ileus/subileus in the P+FOLFIRI arm (2 fatal) vs. only one 
case in the FOLFIRI alone arm. Moreover, there have been spontaneous reports of subileus in patients 
treated with the (off-label) combination of panitumumab + irinotecan outside of clinical trials. However, 
an  aggregate  review  of  the  composite  terms  for  gastrointestinal  obstruction/perforation  identified  no 
imbalance between subjects who received panitumumab plus FOLFIRI and FOLFIRI alone (26 subjects 
[4%];  29  subjects  [5%],  respectively.)    No  imbalance  of  ileus  or  subileus  was  observed  when 
comparing subjects treated with panitumumab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone (4 [1%] vs. 6 [1%] 
and 3 [1%] vs. 4 [1%], respectively). 
3.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  addition  of  panitumumab  did  not  aggravate  the  haematological  and  neurological  toxicities  of  the 
cytotoxic  chemotherapies.    Neither  did  it  increase  the  incidence  of  infusion-related  reactions  in 
comparison  with  these  treatments  alone  (<  1%  with  irinotecan,  comparable  to  panitumumab 
monotherapy, and 2% with oxaliplatin). 
However, the addition of panitumumab did substantially increase the overall incidence of the high-level 
AEs reported; for example, the patient incidence of grade ≥ 3 AEs was augmented from 76% to 88% 
with oxaliplatin and from 56% to 75% with irinotecan.  This unfavourable effect of panitumumab was 
particularly pronounced in patients with mutant KRAS receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. 
The occurrence of diarrhoea with panitumumab was much higher on combined therapy (up to 68% of 
the  patients)  than  on  monotherapy  (21%  in  the  pivotal  trial).    Most  importantly,  it  was  also 
substantially  augmented  when  compared  with  chemotherapy  alone,  including  the  occurrence  of  the 
most severe cases (from 9% up to 14-18%) and serious cases (from 3-4% up to 10%; one fatal case 
in  study  20050181).    This  was  associated  with  an  increased  proportion  of  patients  presenting  with 
hypokalaemia and dehydration. 
Skin toxicities specific to EGFR inhibitors are an important contributor to the overall increase in severe 
toxicities  of  the  combination  of  panitumumab  with  chemotherapy;  grade  ≥3  skin  toxicities  were 
observed  in  34%  of  the  patients  treated  with  panitumumab  vs.  2%  on  chemotherapy  alone.    This 
includes in particular severe (grade 3/4) rash and acneiform dermatitis, the occurrence of which rose 
with  treatment  duration.    Palmar-plantar  erythrodysesthesia  syndrome  was  a  new  adverse  reaction 
that had not been described on monotherapy.

Hypomagnesaemia,  another  specific  effect  of  anti-EGFR  therapies,  and  sometimes  associated  with 
hypocalcaemia,  also  contributed  to  the  excess  toxicity  of  the  combination  of  panitumumab  with 
chemotherapy,  as  reflected  by  severe  (grade  ≥3)  decreases  in  magnesium  levels  in  11%  of  the 
patients. 
Even general toxicities including fatigue/asthenia, anorexia and decreased weight were reported more 
frequently  by  patients  receiving  panitumumab  than  chemotherapy  alone.    Anorexia  and  decreased 
weight were new adverse reactions. 
Importantly,  all  these  effects  of  panitumumab,  and  especially  diarrhoea  and  rash,  had  an  impact  on 
compliance  with  chemotherapy  and  its  intensity  in  a  significant  number  of  cases  with  permanent 
discontinuation  or  dose  delays  and  adjustments.    Overall,  15-17%  of  the  patients  stopped 
chemotherapy and 18-19% stopped panitumumab treatment due to an adverse event. 
Fatal  adverse  events  occurred  with  a  higher  incidence  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  receiving 
panitumumab  and  oxaliplatin  relative  to  those  receiving  oxaliplatin  alone;  no  particular  pattern  with 
regard to the type of fatal events was apparent.  The number of potential toxic (on-treatment) deaths 
seemed  marginal  when  considering  that  a  number  of  the  fatal  events  were  likely  related  to  the 
underlying disease.  These data alone cannot account for the clear difference in survival favouring the 
no-panitumumab arm that was shown in the MK group treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. 
Whereas  cardiac  toxicity  of  cetuximab  has  been  identified,  there  has  not  been  a  clear  signal  for 
panitumumab until now but a marginal increase in cardiac toxicity cannot be ruled out. 
Panitumumab  seemed  to  augment  the  incidence  of  thromboembolism,  including  severe  cases  (from 
7% to 11% with oxaliplatin). 
Elderly  patients  are  in  general  more  susceptible  to  chemotherapy  toxicities,  as  can  be  observed  to 
some extent in the control groups, but serious adverse events were more common in patients aged ≥ 
65 years than in younger patients when panitumumab was added to chemotherapy.  Some toxicities of 
panitumumab appear particularly more frequent in patients older than 65 years; these mainly included 
diarrhoea, thromboembolic events, stomatitis/oral mucositis, and hypomagnesaemia. 
3.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The toxicity of the combined therapy was worse than the toxicity of the chemotherapy alone, especially 
in patients older than 65 years, and had some impact on the compliance to chemotherapy.  Although 
panitumumab  is  indicated  for  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  only,  the  lack  of  an  explanation  for  the 
harmful  effects  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  raised 
concerns  about  the  safety  of  administering  panitumumab  in  combination  with  oxaliplatin-based 
chemotherapy to patients with mCRC. 
3.7.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
In both phase III studies a statistically significant but modest increase in progression-free survival was 
observed  in  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  tumours.  There  was  a  small  absolute  difference  in  median 
survival (1.4 - 1.8 months) and hazard ratios around 0.80 in the most mature analyses.  In the first-
line setting with FOLFOX, a 10%-13% difference in the estimated event-free rates was only observed 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 46/69
 
   
 
 
   
 
around  the  1-year  endpoint  while  in  the  second-line  setting  with  FOLFIRI,  a  7%-15%  difference  was 
observed over the first 40 weeks only. 
None  of  the  studies  showed  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  overall  survival  favourable  to  the 
addition of panitumumab in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
None  of  the  studies  showed  a  statistically  significant  effect  of  panitumumab  on  overall  survival  in 
patients with wild-type KRAS tumours. The objective tumour response to panitumumab was marginal 
in first-line treatment (55% vs. 48%), although slightly improved in the final analysis (57% vs. 48%), 
and only significant in second-line treatment (35% vs. 10%).  The clinical relevance of response rate in 
this disease setting has not been established for this type of agent. 
In the first-line setting (study 20050203): 
 
The findings lack internal consistency insofar as the differences in PFS and OS in patients with 
wild-type  KRAS  tumours  are  entirely  driven  by  the  ROW  population,  i.e.  Central-Eastern 
Europe/Latin America/South Africa. 
 
There is also no evidence of benefit on PFS in patients older than 75 years or even in the large 
subpopulation of patients older than 65 years.  Furthermore, in the very small group of elderly 
patients  ≥  75  years  old  there  was  a  higher  number  of  deaths,  likely  due  to  increased 
susceptibility  to  the  toxicity  of  the  combined  regimen  as  reflected  in  the  safety  data.    Any 
extrapolation of benefit to this population, which currently represents 40% of the patients with 
mCRC at diagnosis, is therefore impossible. 
  Adding panitumumab to FOLFOX appears harmful in patients with an ECOG score of 2, where 
significantly shortened PFS and OS as well as increased toxicity were observed. 
In the second-line setting (study 20050181): 
 
The highly statistical results shown in the primary PFS analysis (p < 0.004) are not considered 
robust  in  a  more  mature  analysis,  where  they  become  borderline  to  the  threshold  level  (p< 
0.01) requested in the statistical analysis plan. 
  A  certain  level  of  inconsistency  was  noted  in  the  results.    Importantly,  no  OS  benefit  was 
reported  in  the  small  group  of  patients  older  than  75  years  (HR  >  1).    Even  in  the  largest 
group of patients aged < 65 years, an apparent benefit in PFS (HR=0.69) did not translate into 
OS  benefit  (HR  =  0.92);  the  overall  mortality  rates  were  similar  (66%  vs.  65%),  especially 
because of more deaths due to disease progression in the long-term follow-up (63% vs. 57% 
with FOLFIRI alone) (data from FU2 029.1). 
Patient  reported  outcomes  can  be  important  especially  given  the  high  toxicity  of  the  combined 
regimens.    The  various  analyses  of  QoL  data  do  not  show  any  benefit  of  adding  panitumumab  but 
rather  a  numerical  trend  in  favour  of  chemotherapy  alone.    This  result  is  supported  by  a  higher 
proportion  of  WT  patients  with  a  deterioration  of  their  ECOG  score  in  the  FOLFIRI  trial.  These 
observations add uncertainties about any possible benefits of panitumumab in the claimed indications, 
Finally,  the  uncertainties  about  the  effects  of  anti-EGFR  therapies  on  wild-type  KRAS  tumours  are 
expected since it is now known that a number of other mutations in the signalling pathway may confer 
resistance to these therapies.  Other biomarkers such as BRAF, PIK3CA/PTEN, or NRAS but also EGFR 
gene  copy  number,  EGFR  ligands  (epiregulin  and  amphiregulin),  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  in 
codon 497 of EGFR, or levels of EGFR downstream signalling phosphoproteins (e.g. pMEK1, pP70S6K) 
may increase predictive power for response to treatment and are awaiting validation in clinical trials.

Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
In patients with mutant KRAS tumours, a clear negative impact of panitumumab was observed on time 
to progression, PFS and OS when it was combined with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in the first-line 
setting.  These results were robust and found in both geographic regions.  In contrast, the combination 
of panitumumab with FOLFIRI did not appear harmful in these patients, and thus, this negative effect 
seemed to be specific to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.  The MAH hypothesised that this was due to 
a  negative  interaction  between  anti-EGFR  antibodies  and  oxaliplatin  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS 
mCRC. 
The  addition  of  panitumumab  did  substantially  increase  the  overall  incidence  of  the  high-grade  AEs 
reported  (i.e.  grade  ≥3,  serious,  or  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation).    The  patient  incidence  of 
grade  ≥  3  AEs  was  augmented  from  76%  to  88%  with  oxaliplatin  and  from  56%  to  75%  with 
irinotecan.  This was due mainly to an increase in incidence/severity of diarrhoea, a well-known ADR of 
oxaliplatin  and  irinotecan,  as  well  as  to  the  added  contribution  of  the  toxicities  specific  to  EGFR 
inhibitors. 
 
The  occurrence  of  diarrhoea  with  panitumumab  was  higher  than  on  chemotherapy  alone, 
especially  the  most  severe  cases  (with  patient  incidence  increasing  from  9%  up  to  14-18%) 
and  serious  cases  (from  3-4%  up  to  10%;  one  fatal  case).    This  was  associated  with  an 
increased proportion of patients presenting with hypokalaemia and dehydration. 
  Grade  ≥3  skin  toxicities  were  observed in  34%  of  the  patients  treated  with panitumumab  vs. 
2% on chemotherapy alone.  This included in particular severe (grade 3/4) rash and acneiform 
dermatitis, the occurrence of which rose with treatment duration. 
  Hypomagnesaemia,  sometimes  associated  with  hypocalcaemia,  also  contributed  to  the  excess 
toxicity of the combination of panitumumab with chemotherapy, as reflected by severe (grade 
≥3) decreases in magnesium levels in 11% of the patients. 
 
Panitumumab  also  seemed  to  increase  the  incidence  of  thromboembolism,  including  severe 
cases (from 7% to 11% with oxaliplatin). 
 
Even  general  toxicities  including  fatigue/asthenia,  anorexia  and  decreased  weight  were 
reported more frequently by patients receiving panitumumab than chemotherapy alone.  A new 
ADR of Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome was identified. 
Importantly,  all  these  effects  of  panitumumab,  and  especially  diarrhoea  and  rash,  had  an  impact  on 
compliance  with  chemotherapy  and  its  intensity  in  a  significant  number  of  cases  with  permanent 
discontinuation or dose delays and adjustments. 
Elderly patients were in general more susceptible to chemotherapy toxicities, as could be observed to 
some extent in the control groups, but serious adverse events were more common in patients aged ≥ 
65 years than in younger patients when panitumumab was added to chemotherapy.  Some toxicities of 
panitumumab  appeared  particularly  more  frequent  in  patients  older  than  65  years;  these  mainly 
included diarrhoea, thromboembolic events, stomatitis/oral mucositis, and hypomagnesaemia. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In study 20050181, the reporting rates of severe and serious AEs were about 20% lower in the ROW 
region  (essentially  Central-Eastern  Europe),  which  provided  39%  of  the  total  population,  than  in  the 
Western Europe/US/Australia region.  This finding was attributed by the MAH to ‘regional and cultural 
differences’ but is still largely unexplained. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 48/69
 
 
 
   
 
Fatal adverse events occurred at a similar rate in the treatment arms of the wild-type KRAS groups of 
both studies.  In the mutant KRAS groups, increases in fatal adverse events with panitumumab were 
seen to some extent in both studies: 8% vs. 3% in the control arm of study 20050203 and 7% vs. 5% 
in  the  control  arm  of  study  20050181.    Recent  analyses  of  the  timing  and  cause  of  deaths  in  study 
20050203  did  not  identify  obvious  toxicities  to  explain  the  mortality  that  was  not  related  to  disease 
progression.    There  was  no  clear  signal  for  worse  cardiac  toxicity  but  a  marginal  increase  cannot  be 
ruled out. 
The  MAH  argued  that  toxicity  of  panitumumab  is  manageable.  However,  severe  protracted  diarrhoea 
and  disfiguring  or  painful  skin  lesions  may  be  severely  disabling  with  patients  eventually  being 
homebound.  The impact of these toxicities on the patient quality of life was reflected by the absence 
of  improvement  with  the  addition  of  panitumumab  and  rather  a  numerical  trend  favouring 
chemotherapy  alone.    Furthermore,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  exhibited  a  deterioration  of  their 
ECOG score in the FOLFIRI trial. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  difference  in  PFS  was  small  and  did  not  translate  into  significant  improvement  in  OS  or  other 
clinical benefit.   
The  lack  of  evidence  of  QoL  benefit  over  chemotherapy  alone  with  a  numerical  trend  in  favour  of 
chemotherapy  alone  and  more  frequent  deterioration  of  ECOG  performance  status  in  the  second-line 
setting is to be expected given the substantial increase in toxicity of the combination of panitumumab 
with  chemotherapy  as  compared  with  chemotherapy  alone.    This  is  especially  a  concern  in  the  older 
patients. 
Given that KRAS determination is critical for the indication of panitumumab, it is questionable whether 
the  small  benefits  achieved  in  clinical  trials  where  KRAS  status  was  centrally  diagnosed  can  be 
generalised.    Indeed,  they  are  likely  to  be  smaller  in  a  broad  clinical  setting,  where  the  reliability  of 
KRAS diagnosis has not yet been established. 
The  negative  impact  of  panitumumab  on  the  survival  of  patients  with  KRAS  mutant  tumours  when 
combined  with  oxaliplatin-based  chemotherapy  is  considered  a  major  concern  since  the  proportion  of 
patients  with  KRAS  mutations  potentially  treated  with  panitumumab  is  unknown  and  very  difficult  to 
estimate.  The reasons for such wrong treatments are multiple and include non evaluable test results, 
unreliable test methods, or mutations not detectable by the test used.  Moreover, no clear reason has 
been found to explain this negative impact.  No obvious toxic interaction has been found and it is not 
clear whether the negative effect is to be related to the mutant KRAS status only, or if there are other 
groups  of  patients  at  risk  of  negative effects,  such  as  those  with  poor  performance  status.   The  MAH 
hypothesised that this is due to a negative interaction between anti-EGFR antibodies and oxaliplatin in 
patients with mutant KRAS mCRC. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
The  modest  increase  in  PFS  observed  in  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  tumours  by  the  addition  of 
panitumumab to the first and second line of chemotherapy for mCRC was not considered sufficient to 
outweigh the increased toxicity of the combinations.

4.  Conclusion 
On  17  March  2011  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  not  to  be  acceptable  on  the  following 
grounds: 
 
The  benefit  in  terms  of  progression  free  survival  in  the  target  population  with  wild-type  KRAS 
tumours  is modest.  No  effect  could  be  observed  in  elderly  patients  and  a  detrimental  effect  was 
observed  in  patients  with  ECOG  performance  status  of  2  in  some  of  the  subgroup  analyses.  No 
statistically  significant  difference  was  observed  for  overall  survival.   No  benefit  has  been 
established in terms of other clinical endpoints such as Quality of Life 
 
The add-on toxicity of panitumumab is clinically significant with substantial increase in the rate of 
SAEs and grade ≥ 3 events. These concerns are heightened in elderly patients, as some toxicities 
of panitumumab appear particularly more frequent in these patients 
 
There is uncertainty about the current reliability of KRAS testing in clinical practice, which raises a 
concern  since  a  detrimental  effect  on  progression-free  and  overall  survival  has  been  reported  in 
patients with mutant KRAS tumours for the combination of panitumumab with FOLFOX 
 
The modest increase in PFS observed in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours by the addition of 
panitumumab to the first and second line of chemotherapy for mCRC is not considered sufficient 
to outweigh the increased toxicity of the combinations 
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 18 March 2011 
Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  variation  to  the  terms  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  of 
Vectibix  to  extend  the  indication  to  treatment  of  metastatic  colorectal  carcinoma  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy was not approvable, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of 
the grounds for refusal.  
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The  applicant  presented  in  writing  and  at  an  oral  explanation  a  number  of  arguments  refuting  the 
grounds for refusal. 
Ground  #1  (modest  efficacy):  The  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP  concern  regarding  the  lack  of 
consistency of the observed benefit in subgroups and presented further subgroup efficacy analyses for 
both studies according to age and performance status. Moreover, the MAH argued that resectability of 
liver-only metastases after first line chemotherapy may provide an important survival benefit, so that 
analyses  of  resectability  of  liver-only  metastases  of  patients  receiving  FOLFOX  +  panitumumab  vs 
FOLFOX in the first line 20050203 study were submitted. Finally, with regard to Quality of Life captured 
through  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  (PRO),  the  MAH  repeated  that  overall  no  statistically  significant 
deterioration  was  observed  and  submitted  additional  analyses  showing  that  this  was  also  the  case 
specifically with regard to skin toxicities and diarrhoea. PRO scores did not differ between patients with 
different grades of skin toxicities or diarrhoea (data not shown).

Ground  #2 (add-on toxicity) The MAH argued that in both first and second line studies the toxicity of 
panitumumab was manageable and consistent with the addition of an EGFR inhibitor to chemotherapy 
and that it didn’t lead to  any higher discontinuation of treatment in any of the two studies. The MAH 
submitted  further  subgroup  safety  analyses  in  patients  with  ECOG  0/1  PS  and  age  <65  years  for  the 
first line 20050203 study and in patients with ECOG 0/1 PS for the second line 20050181 study.

With  regard  to  the  deterioration  of  PFS  and  OS  for  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumour  status  with 
panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX specifically, the MAH argued that most of the fatal adverse 
events were in the setting of disease progression and that no single cause appeared to account for the 
worse  outcomes  or  increased 
incidence  of 
fatal  adverse  events.  They  considered  that  a 
pharmacodynamic  interaction  between  panitumumab  and  oxaliplatin  that  attenuates  the  treatment 
effect of oxaliplatin likely contributed to the negative outcomes and that for patients with mutant KRAS 
mCRC tumours or for whom KRAS mCRC tumour status is unknown, the combination of panitumumab 
with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be contraindicated. 
Integument-related  toxicity  is  the  most  common  reason  for  the  increase  in  adverse  and  serious 
adverse  events  associated  with  panitumumab  treatment.  Interestingly,  it  has  been  reported  that 
subjects  who  experience  greater  skin  toxicity  derive  more  clinical  benefit  from  EGFR  antibodies 
(Van Cutsem  et  al,  2011),  as  skin  toxicity  represents  a  pharmacodynamic  consequence  of  EGFR 
inhibition.  In  the  first  line  study  20050203,  for  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  tumour  status  with 
maximum  skin  toxicity  of  grade  2  to  4  vs  grade  1,  median  PFS  (n  =  305)  was  10.8  months  vs  6.0 
months  (hazard  ratio = 0.63;  95%  CI:  0.42-0.93;  p = 0.019),  and  median  OS  (n  =  308)  was  28.3 
months  vs  11.5  months  (hazard  ratio = 0.47;  95  CI:  0.32-0.71;  p = 0.0002.  Similarly, in  the  second 
line study 20050181, for patients with wild-type KRAS status with skin toxicity of grade 2 to 4 vs grade 
1, median PFS was 7.4 months vs 5.2 months (hazard ratio = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.49-0.90, p = 0.009); 
median OS was 16.5 months vs 10.3 months (hazard ratio = 0.46; 95 CI: 0.33-0.65; p < 0.0001).

Ground  #3  (reliability  and  use  of  KRAS  testing  in  clinical  practice)  The  MAH  repeated  that  only 
patients with wild-type KRAS tumour status confirmed using a validated test kit should be treated with 
panitumumab  and  that  panitumumab  should  not  be  administered  to  patients  with  mutant  KRAS 
tumours or patients who have not been evaluated for KRAS tumour status. Moreover, they argued that 
  Awareness of the importance of KRAS testing prior to initiation of anti-EGFR agents is high. Current 
EU  mCRC  therapy  guidelines  (Van  Cutsem  et  al,  2010)  support  the  need  for  KRAS  testing  in 
patients with mCRC, and this recommendation is reflected in the currently approved SmPC.  
  KRAS  mutations  occur  early  in  tumourigenesis,  and  once  acquired,  are  maintained  throughout 
carcinogenesis;  therefore  test  results  can  be  relied  on  to  always  reflect  the  current  state  of 
disease, even if based on archived tumour tissue. 
 
The current KRAS testing methods are robust, sensitive, specific (false positive and false negative 
results in the order of 1%) and KRAS testing is one of the most accurate molecular diagnostic tools 
in oncology (compared to HER2 and EGFR testing) regardless of the method used. 
  Wild-type KRAS tumour status is required for reimbursement for EGFR monoclonal antibody use in 
all  EU  member  states.    It  is  therefore  highly  unlikely  that  a  significant  number  of  patients  with 
unknown or mutant KRAS tumour status would be treated with panitumumab. 
  Risks  from  wrongly  administering  panitumumab  to  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumour  status  or 
patients that have not been tested for KRAS tumour status can be managed via proposed routine 
risk  minimisation  activities  through  the  Product  Information  and  additional  risk  minimisation 
activities proposed in the risk management plan. 
Ground #4 (benefit-risk balance) The MAH argued that with regard to the combination with FOLFOX: 
 
Panitumumab  represents  an  important  therapeutic  option  for  appropriately  selected  patients 
(ECOG status 0/1 and < 65 years of age). 
 
The  increase  in  complete  resection  rate  in  subjects  with  metastases  to  the  liver  only  at  baseline 
represents  an  important  clinical  benefit.  Given  that  complete  resection  of  metastases  is  the  only 
chance for long term survival, or possibly cure, for patients with mCRC, the use of panitumumab in 
combination  with  FOLFOX  should  be  offered  as  a  treatment  option  for  patients  with  resectable 
disease. 
Moreover, with regard to the combination with FOLFIRI the MAH argued that: 
 
the  overall  benefit-risk  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with  FOLFIRI  has  been  established  based 
on  the  results  of  Study  20050181.  However,  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  this  combination  is 
questionable in patients with ECOG 2 status. 
Based on all the MAH arguments presented above and additional analyses (responses to Grounds #1-
4), the MAH proposed to restrict the indication of panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy for 
the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma as follows: 
• 
in combination with FOLFIRI for patients with ECOG 0/1 performance status 
• 
in  combination  with  FOLFOX  for  patients  with  ECOG  0/1  performance  status  and  who  are  less 
than 65 years of age or for patients who are eligible for resection of liver metastases”

Scientific Advisory Group-Oncology consultation 
The  CHMP  convened  a  Scientific  Advisory  Group  (SAG)  inviting  the  experts  to  provide  their  views  on 
the  CHMP  grounds  for  refusal,  taking into  account the  MAH’s  response.  In  addition,  the experts  were 
requested to respond to a number of questions related to the re-analyses presented by the MAH, and 
they considered the following: 
First line of metastatic CRC in combination with FOLFOX 
1.  Study  20050203  shows  the  following  effect  of  panitumumab+FOLFOX  as  compared  to 
placebo+FOLFOX: 
- A median PFS increase in wild-type KRAS patients of 1.4 months and hazard ratio of 0.80 (p=0.009) 
-  A  not  statistically  significant  difference  in  median  survival  of  4  months  and  hazard  ratio  of  0.88 
(p=0.17) 
- A significant increase in objective response rate: 57% vs. 48% (p=0.02) 
-  No  demonstrated  benefit  in  QoL  outcomes,  with  numerical  differences  in  favour  of  chemotherapy 
alone 
In  the  light  of  these  data,  does  the  SAG  consider  that  the  effect  of  panitumumab  added  to 
FOLFOX  in  first  line  treatment  of  mCRC  is  clinically  relevant  as  to  outweigh  the  increased 
toxicity observed with the combination? 
The  SAG  considered  that  the  clinical  efficacy  of  panitumumab  in  the  first  line  treatment  of  wild-type 
KRAS, metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFOX was demonstrated.  
This conclusion pertains specifically to the combination with FOLFOX at the applied dose and schedule 
and  it  cannot  be  extrapolated  to  other  oxaliplatin  regimens.  One  reason  that  could  explain 
discrepancies with other schedules is that overlapping toxicity between panitumumab and non-FOLFOX 
oxaliplatin  regimens  tested  in  clinical  trials  (e.g.  capecitabine-XELOX)  led  to  interruptions/dose 
reductions of the chemotherapy with loss in efficacy. 
The toxicity overall seems to be manageable. 
It is at this moment uncertain which biological factors besides Kras mutational status affect activity of 
panitumumab in this combination.  
The  size  of  the  effect  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  appears  to  be  smaller  in  comparison  to  the 
combination of panitumumab with FOLFIRI in second line treatment due to uncertain biological factors.  
The ECOG performance score was a moderate predictor of activity in the first line setting whereas age 
did not have any predictive value.  
Skin rash in the course of treatment appears to be a predictive marker of benefit from panitumumab, 
but  this  will  need  to  be  further  substantiated.  Towards  this  end,  the  MAH  may  present  outcomes  of 
patients in the chemotherapy alone arms of the two pivotal trials according to the appearance and the 
grade  of  skin  rash.  There  is  evidence  from  trials  with  other  EGFR  inhibitors  to  suggest  that  patients 
who develop rash although not receiving EGFR inhibitors fare better compared to patients who do not 
develop rash at all, a fact which would argue against skin rash being a predictor of specific anti-EGFR 
activity.  However,  based  on  the  currently  available  data,  skin  rash  in  the  course  of  panitumumab 
treatment may be used to guide clinical decision making.

2.  Patients  with  ECOG  performance  status  2  show  a  significant  increase  in  toxicity  associated  with 
significantly shorter PFS and OS compared with FOLFOX alone. Similarly, patients older than 75 years 
present increased mortality and no effect on PFS and OS (HR≥1).  
2.1.  How  does  the  SAG  interpret  the  lack  of  consistency  of  the  results  described  above 
across the study population? 
The  SAG  noted  the  low  numbers  of  patients  in  various  subgroups  (ECOG  PS  2,  old  age).  They 
considered  that  subgroup  analyses in the  absence  of  both  hypothesis  testing  and  adequate  statistical 
power  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Based  on  the  existing  data,  relevant  decisions  on  practical 
clinical use are better left to clinical judgement.  
2.2.  Does  the  SAG  consider  that  restricting  the  indication  to  patients  with  ECOG  0-1  would 
resolve this concern? 
Based  on  limited  available  data,  there  are  concerns  about  the  benefit/risk  balance  in  certain  patients 
with  ECOG  PS  2  in  this  treatment  setting,  but  no  overall  recommendations  can  be  made  for  PS2 
patients (refer also to 2.1). It is conceivable, for example, that patients with ECOG PS 2 due to disease 
burden may be better able to benefit from panitumumab treatment compared to patients with similar 
performance status due to co-morbidities. 
2.3  Considering  data  from  study  20050203,  does  the  SAG-O  consider  that  older  age  is  an 
independent  predictor  of  poor  response  and  increased  toxicity  in  patients  treated  with 
panitumumab? 
The  SAG  do  not  consider  old  age  (of  any  cut-off)  as  an  independent  risk  factor,  but  toxicity  may  be 
considerably increased in older patients in this treatment setting (refer also to 2.1). Based on available 
data,  there  is  no  biological  rationale  to  suggest  a  restriction  based  on  age,  e.g.  data  to  suggest 
different pharmacokinetics of panitumumab in older patients. Such pharmacological (pharmacokinetic-
dynamic) data are lacking. 
3.  Does  the  SAG  consider  that,  based  on  the  data  provided,  a  detrimental  effect  of  the 
addition  of  panitumumab  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumours  can  be  reasonably 
excluded?  Is  KRAS  testing  in  clinical  practice  performed  without  exception  by  all  treating 
physicians and is the quality of the available KRAS tests sufficiently reliable to ensure that 
patients with mutant KRAS tumours will not be treated with panitumumab? 
The SAG considered that a detrimental effect of the addition of panitumumab in patients with mutant 
KRAS  tumours  cannot  be  excluded.  Patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumours  should  be  excluded  from 
treatment  with  panitumumab.  The  SAG  also  considered  that  clinically  available  KRAS  testing  is 
sufficiently reliable and that panitumumab should not be used in untested patients, but it should only 
be used in patients with wild-type KRAS tumours. 
Second line of metastatic CRC in combination with FOLFIRI 
4.  Study  20050181  shows  the  following  effect  of  panitumumab+FOLFIRI  as  compared  to 
placebo+FOLFIRI: 
- A median PFS increase in wild-type KRAS patients of 1.8 months and hazard ratio of 0.82 (p=0.002); 
-  A  no  effect  in  overall  survival,  with  a  median  difference  of  2  months  and  hazard  ratio  of  0.92 
(p=0.37)] 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 59/69
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
- A significant increase in objective response rate: 36% vs. 10% (p=0.0001) 
-  No  demonstrated  benefit  in  QoL  outcomes,  with  numerical  differences  in  favour  of  chemotherapy 
alone 
In  the  light  of  these  data,  does  the  SAG  consider  that  the  effect  of  panitumumab  added  to 
FOLFIRI in second line treatment of mCRC is clinically relevant as to outweigh the increased 
toxicity observed with the combination? 
The  SAG  considered  that  the  effect  of  panitumumab  added  to  FOLFIRI  in  second  line  treatment  of 
mCRC is clinically relevant as to outweigh the increased toxicity of the combination. As already noted 
in  the  answer  to  question  1,  the  effect  appears  in  fact  to  be  stronger  with  the  FOLFIRI  combination 
than  with  the  FOLFOX  combination  at  the  applied  dose  and  schedule.  This  conclusion  pertains 
specifically  to  the  combination  with  FOLFIRI  at  the  applied  dose  and  schedule  and  it  should  not  be 
extrapolated to other irinotecan regimens. 
General question  
5. Does the SAG-O overall consider the results observed for panitumumab to be in line with 
what  has  been  observed  for  cetuximab?  If  not,  what  could  possibly  be  the  reasons 
considering the same mechanism of action of the two drugs?  
Caution  should  always  be  exercised  in  comparing  results  from  different  trials.  Notwithstanding  that, 
results  from trials  with  cetuximab  and  panitumumab  seem  broadly  comparable.  On  this point, it is  of 
note that in the two more readily comparable last-line monotherapy trials the post-progression cross-
over to subsequent anti-EGFR therapy was much higher in the panitumumab trial (76%) than it was in 
the  cetuximab  one  (7%),  which  may  have  confounded  Overall  Survival  results  in  the  case  of 
panitumumab.  On  the  other  hand,  the  two  antibodies  belong  to  different  subclasses  of  IgG  and  they 
apparently  differ  in  their  molecular  pharmacology  (e.g.  ADCC,  avidity,  FcR  binding),  so  that  different 
outcomes from the two antibodies clinically cannot be excluded. In this respect, differences in the rate 
of infusion reactions and in the treatment schedule between the two drugs are also of relevance.  
In addition, the SAG-oncology wished to stress that panitumumab treatment should only be considered 
in patients who are anti-EGFR therapy naïve.  
Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination  
The CHMP assessed all the detailed grounds for re-examination and argumentations presented by the 
applicant  and  considered  the  views  of  the  Scientific  Advisory  Group-Oncology  that  unanimously 
expressed a positive opinion towards the positive benefit/risk of the requested indications (combination 
with FOLFOX-first line indication and the combination with FOLFIRI–second line indication). 
The Committee noted that although the improvement in median PFS was modest, it is within the same 
magnitude  as  that  seen  with  other  biological  agents  added  to  chemotherapy  in  both  first  and  second 
line treatment and that the addition of anti-EGFR antibodies to chemotherapy in these disease settings 
is  established  in  clinical  practice  in  the  EU.  Especially  in  second  line  treatment  (combination  with 
FOLFIRI)  the  observed  effect  may  be  of  higher  clinical  relevance  given  the  poorer  health  status  and 
worse prognosis of patients in this setting. 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 60/69
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
The  lack  of  support  by  statistically  significant  improvements  of  OS  could  indeed  be  attributed  to 
subsequent anti-EGFR therapy which was higher in the control arms of both studies (25.4% vs 12.9% 
with  panitumumab  add-on  in  patients  with  wild-type  KRAS  tumours  in  the  first  line  FOLFOX  study 
[Table 6] and 34.4% vs 12.5%, respectively, in the same population in the second line FOLFIRI study 
[Table 11]). The fact that patients in the control arms of the panitumumab studies were likely to cross 
over  and  receive  subsequent  anti-EGFR  therapy  once  out  of  the  studies  and  that  this  cross-over  was 
higher  in  these  later  panitumumab  studies  compared  to  earlier  cetuximab  ones,  may  be  seen  as  an 
indicator that the addition of anti-EGFR antibodies to chemotherapy for mCRC has been increasing. 
Although the clinical relevance of ORR may not have been established for this type of agent in first and 
second line treatment of mCRC, the observed improvement cannot be ignored and it can be of clinical 
relevance in the first line setting, as a response (tumour shrinkage) may render the tumour resectable 
and  thus  allow  surgical  resection  of  metastases  in  certain  cases,  which  may  significantly  prolong 
survival of patients eligible for this resection. 
With regard  to the inferior (in some instances numerically worse) results observed in elderly patients 
and patients with poor ECOG Performance Status (ECOG PS 2), the CHMP considered that indeed the 
numbers of patients in the relevant subgroups of the two studies are small and that the relevant post-
hoc subgroup analyses should be interpreted with caution. It was therefore not considered appropriate 
to restrict any potential indication based on age or performance status. It is already clinical reality and 
it is reinforced via adequate warnings and precautions in the Product Information that decisions to use 
panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy in mCRC are based on clinical judgement which takes 
into account individual patient characteristics, including performance status and age. Furthermore, skin 
rash in the course of panitumumab treatment may be used to guide clinical decision making, although 
no strict recommendations can be given at present. No additional analyses were presented by the MAH 
on the potential value of skin rash as a predictive marker of benefit from panitumumab, as proposed 
by the SAG-O, but the MAH confirmed during the Oral Explanation that no skin rash was observed in 
patients  receiving  chemotherapy  only,  other  than  the  Palmar-Plantar  Erythrodysaesthesia  (or  hand-
foot) Syndrome, as expected during treatment with fluoropyrimidines.  
In  terms  of  Quality  of  Life,  the  CHMP  noted  that,  although  an  improvement  in  this  would  have  been 
desirable, QoL was by and large unaffected by the addition of panitumumab to chemotherapy, even so 
in patients experiencing the common skin rash and diarrhoea. Moreover, the Committee was reassured 
by clinical experts’ affirmations that toxicity of panitumumab was indeed manageable and that there is 
experience  in  handling  panitumumab  toxicity  in  clinical  practice.  With  regard  to  elderly  patients,  who 
tended to show increased toxicity, it was confirmed that it is usual clinical practice for this type of anti-
cancer agents to exercise expert clinical judgement in deciding who should receive panitumumab add-
on  taking  into  account  performance  status  and  other  clinical  considerations  (disease  burden, 
comorbidities etc).  
Panitumumab should only be used in patients with wild-type KRAS tumour status and it should not be 
used  in  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumour  status  or  in  patients  who  have  not  been  tested.  The 
Committee  was  reassured  that  the  KRAS  testing  methods  were  widely  available  and  used  in  clinical 
practice, that the methods are robust and adequately sensitive and specific, at least as much as other 
established diagnostic methods such as HER2 and EGFR testing. In considering the SAG-O outcome the 
CHMP decided to contraindicate the combination of Vectibix with FOLFOX in patients with mutant KRAS 
mCRC  or  patients  whose  KRAS  tumour  status  is  unnown.  Moreover,  the  risk  of  administering 
panitumumab  to  mutant  KRAS  tumour  patients  can  be  adequately  managed  via  the  agreed  risk 
management plan (please refer to Risk Management Plan below). 
With regard to biomarkers other than KRAS, the CHMP agreed that the level of EGFR expression does 
not  play  a  major  role  in  CRC  in  contrast  to  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  and  squamous  cell 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 61/69
 
 
 
   
 
cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN), in which mean expression levels of EGFR are much higher and 
there is much larger inter-tumour variability. The CHMP stressed the importance of attempts to identify 
such biomarkers that could potentially help better the target population of panitumumab. 
In conclusion, the CHMP considered after reviewing the additional subgroup efficacy analyses provided 
by the MAH and considering the expert advice received from the SAG-Oncology, that there is sufficient 
reassurance  that  the  toxicity  observed  for  panitumumab  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  as  first  line 
treatment  of  patients  with  mCRC  and  in  combination  with  FOLFIRI  as  second  line  treatment  is 
manageable  and  no  longer  constitutes  a  major  issue.  It  was  confirmed  by  the  experts,  for  example, 
that  careful  monitoring  of  skin  toxicity  is  an  established  practice,  which  can  be  used  to  guide  clinical 
decision making. Overall, the efficacy was considered to be clinically relevant in the applied doses and 
schedules  of  the  specific  combinations  and  very  consistent  with  the  known  effect  of  other  drugs  with 
similar  mechanism  of  action  used  in  the  same  clinical  setting.  However,  these  conclusions  cannot  be 
considered to apply in general to other chemotherapy combinations. The product information has been 
amended to adequately reflect these restrictions.  
The  CHMP  also  acknowledged  that  in  line  with  the  advice  received  from  the  expert  group,  subgroup-
specific trial mortality results cannot provide a reliable basis for individualising patient care, due to the 
play  of  chance.  Thus,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the results  in  poor  performance  status  and  older  age 
subgroups should be interpreted more cautiously as they may lead to a significant number of patients 
being  left  untreated  inappropriately.  Sufficient  reassurance  was  provided  from  the  expert  group  that 
clinical decisions can be sufficiently informed by the available data to allow adequate patient selection 
and  management  of  toxicity  depending  on  the  clinical  characteristics  of  the  patients.  Overall,  the 
apparent lack of consistency in light of the unfavourable results seen in elderly and poor health status 
subgroups was no longer considered a major concern.   
The  CHMP  was  also  reassured  that  KRAS  testing  is  widely  available  in  clinical  practice  and  that  its 
operational  characteristics  are  adequate  and  well  defined.  The  product  information  was  amended  on 
this  issue  and,  most  prominently,  a  contraindication  was  added  on  the  use  of  panitumumab  in 
combination with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy in patients with mutant KRAS tumour status or 
for whom KRAS status is unknown. Moreover, the agreed risk management plan and the additional risk 
minimisation activities in the form of physician educational materials can adequately manage the risk 
of  treating  with  panitumumab  patients  with  mutant  KRAS  tumours  or  patients  whose  KRAS  tumour 
status  is  unknown,  so  that  this  risk  was  sufficiently  low  as  not  to  pose  a  major  concern.  Finally,  the 
CHMP  agreed  on  the  wording  of  a  Direct  Healthcare  Professional  Communication  (please  refer  to 
Attachment 13) to be circulated to prescribers prior to the start of use of Vectibix with the aim to raise 
awareness on the issue of KRAS testing and its role during treatment with panitumumab. 
Taking all these considerations into account, the CHMP revised its initial opinion and concluded that the 
benefit-risk  balance  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  as  first  line  treatment  of  patients 
with mCRC and in combination with FOLFIRI as second line treatment of patients with mCRC who have 
received  first-line  fluoropyrimidine-based  chemotherapy  (excluding  irinotecan)  for  their  disease  was 
positive.

4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Statement that there are no adequate data on the use 
of Vectibix in pregnant women.  In women of 
childbearing potential, appropriate contraceptive 
measures must be used during treatment with 
Vectibix, and for 6 months following the last dose. 
Women who become pregnant during Vectibix 
treatment are encouraged to enroll in Amgen’s 
Pregnancy Surveillance programme. Contact details 
are provided in section 6 of the Package Leaflet – 
Information for the user. 
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Statement that it 
is unknown whether panitumumab is excreted in 
human breast milk. Because human IgG is secreted 
into human milk, panitumumab might also be 
secreted. It is recommended that women do not 
breast feed during treatment with Vectibix and for 
3 months after the last dose. 
4.2  Posology and Method of Administration Statement 
that there is no experience in children and Vectibix 
should not be used in those patients less than 18 
years of age.

that the safety and efficacy of Vectibix have not been 
studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
4.3 Contraindications 
Interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis 
4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
Statement that patients with a history of, or evidence 
of, interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis were 
excluded from clinical studies 
4.8  Undesirable Effects 
Description of Selected Adverse Reactions  
Statement that the safety and efficacy of Vectibix have 
not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties 
Statement that no clinical studies have been 
conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of 
Vectibix in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
4.2  Posology and Method of Administration  
Statement that the recommended dose of Vectibix is 
6 mg/kg of body weight given once every two weeks. 
4.9 Overdose 
Statement that doses up to 9 mg/kg have been tested 
in clinical trials. There have been reports of overdose 
at doses up to approximately twice the recommended 
CHMP variation assessment report

potential biomarker 
development based on 
assessment of blood 
cells, tumor cells, and 
the proposed 
mechanism of action of 
panitumumab in Study 
20050181 and 
20050203 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  is  of  the  opinion  that 
pharmacovigilance  activities  in  addition  to  the  use  of  routine  pharmacovigilance  were  needed  to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns and that the following risk minimisation activities were 
required for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: 
 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall ensure that all physicians who are expected to prescribe 
Vectibix are provided with educational materials informing them of the importance of KRAS 
ascertainment before treatment with panitumumab. The key elements of these educational 
materials will be the following: 
  Brief introduction to the Vectibix indication and the purpose of this tool 
  Brief introduction to KRAS and its role in the panitumumab mechanism of action  
 
Information that in patients with mutant KRAS tumours panitumumab has shown a detrimental 
effect in combination with FOLFOX and no effect as monotherapy and in combination with 
FOLFIRI  
  Recommendation that Vectibix: 
 
 
should only be used in patients whose tumours are wild-type KRAS 
should not be used in patients whose tumours are mutant KRAS or patients whose tumours 
have not been tested for KRAS status 
 
is contraindicated in combination with FOLFOX in patients with mutant KRAS tumours  
 
Information on how the testing should be appropriately conducted 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder shall agree the format and content of the above materials with the 
National Competent Authority of each Member State.

Recommendation following re-examination 
Based on the CHMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and 
in  its  final  opinion  concluded  by  majority  decision  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vectibix  in  the 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: 
- in first line in combination with FOLFOX  
- in second line in combination with FOLFIRI for patients who have received first-line fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan),  
was  favourable  and  that  the  application  satisfied  the  criteria  for  authorisation  and  recommended  the 
granting of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation.

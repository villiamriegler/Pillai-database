Introduction 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody containing human 
peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  alpha  and  neutralises  the 
biological  function  of  TNFα  by  blocking  its  interaction  with  the  p55  and  p75  cell  surface  TNFα 
receptors. 
Adalimumab  is  currently  approved  for  the  treatment  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  psoriatic  arthritis 
(PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn’s disease (CD).  
The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  applied  for  an  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  to 
include treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in children and adolescents 
aged  4  to  17  years  who  had  had  an  inadequate  response  to  one  or  more  disease  modifying  anti-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The MAH presented the results of the JIA clinical trial to demonstrate 
adalimumab’s safety and efficacy in this population. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disease with a complex genetic predisposition that has 
been  observed  in  children  under  the  age  of  16  years.  It  is  the  most  common  rheumatic  disease  of 
childhood and a cause of disability in children with an incidence of 15 per 100,000, 2.5 times  more 
common in females (North America and European populations). 
In the progression of inflammatory synovitis (an inflammation of the synovial membrane, a layer of 
tissue that lines a joint) and articular matrix degradation the two cytokines (molecules produced by the 
immune  system,  e.g.  during  an  inflammatory  reaction),  TNF-α  and  interleukin  (IL)-1  are  involved. 
When  TNF-α  is  inhibited,  the  levels  of  other  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  are  also  reduced,  such  as 
IL-1 and IL-6. TNF-α is elevated in serum, synovial fluid, and synovial tissue of children with JIA. 
The MAH proposed to amend the text of the summary of product characteristics (SPC) sections 4.1, 
4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2, and to update the package leaflet (PL) accordingly.  
Clinical aspects 
To support the variation application the MAH presented one pivotal study; DE038; where adalimumab 
was  studied  in  paediatric  subjects  with  polyarticular  JIA,  who  were  either  MTX-naïve,  inadequate 
responders or intolerant to MTX. 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics1 
The pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of adalimumab were evaluated in paediatric (4 – 17 years) 
subjects with polyarticular JIA in study DE038. In the 16-week open-label lead-in (OL LI) phase and 
the  32-week  double-blind  (DB)  phase  the  dosing  regimen  was  24  mg  per  m2  (max  40  mg) 
sc (subcutaneously) eow, with or without concomitant methotrexate (MTX). The open-label extension 
comprised  the  same  dosing  based  on  body  surface  area  (OLE  BSA)  and  a  period  with  fixed  dosing 
(OLE FD) treatment (20 mg for subjects with body weights < 30 kg and 40 mg for subjects with body 
weights >30 kg). 
The average (SD) serum concentrations observed in the OL LI and DB phases (average from all time 
points  measured  during  weeks  20  to  48)  in  adalimumab  treated  patients  were  10.9 (5.2) μg/ml  and 
5.5 (5.6)  μg/ml  in  patients  with  and  without  MTX, respectively. The  inter-individual  variability  was 
very  large,  in  particular  in  patients  without  concomitant  MTX  treatment.  Comparative  data  (adult 
versus  juvenile)  on  drug  exposure  was  provided  and  it  appeared  that  the  serum  concentrations  in 
subjects  with  JIA  were  within  the  range  of  those  previously  observed  in  adult  subjects,  both  during 
monotherapy  and  concomitant  MTX  treatment.  There  was  a  tendency  for  a  higher  inter-individual

variability  and  higher  immunogenicity  rate  in  juvenile  subjects  compared  with.  During  concomitant 
MTX treatment the serum levels were on average higher and the variability was lower. 
One-hundred and six patients completed the OLE BSA phase and entered the OLE FD phase, in which 
serum  concentrations  of  adalimumab  were  measured  only  in  patients  who  had  their  dose  changed 
(N=56). When the dose was increased based on the fixed dose regimen serum concentrations increased 
(as expected) with individual values ranging from 0 to 30.7 μg/ml. For the patients where the dose was 
decreased it was not possible to draw any conclusions based on the very sparse data. 
A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of data from juvenile (DE038) and 
adult (DE011 and DE009) patients with RA, with the purpose to assess pharmacokinetic differences 
between  adults  and  children.  However,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  at  present  a  conclusion  of  no 
difference  in  the  pharmacokinetics  between  adults  and  juvenile  subjects  cannot  be  drawn,  due  to 
deficiencies  in  the  analysis.  Further,  on  the  basis  of  juvenile  data  only  (DE038),  a  population 
pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical trial simulations were conducted to support the appropriateness 
of the proposed fixed dose regimen, since the controlled part of the study was conducted with BSA 
dosing.  Several  deficiencies  were  identified  in  the  modelling  and  simulation  activities  and  the 
pharmacokinetic documentation did not contribute in the assessment of safety and efficacy of the fixed 
dosing strategy. The quantitative assessment of the simulations, e.g. 5th, median and 95th percentiles of 
various age groups, was not considered appropriate as the population model did not appear to fit to the 
data and the predictiveness of the model was not assessed properly.  
Immunogenicity 
Only  samples  with  low  adalimumab  concentrations  (<2  microg/ml)  were  analysed  for  anti-
adalimumab antibodies (AAA).  
Twenty-seven  subjects  (16%)  had  at  least  one  AAA  positive  observation  during  the  OL  LI  and  DB 
phases,  whereof  5  (6%)  and  22  (26%)  with  and  without  MTX,  respectively.  The  incidence  of 
antibodies  was  higher  in  juvenile  subjects  on  monotherapy,  compared  with  adults  on  monotherapy, 
while there was no obvious difference in the antibody incidence between juvenile and adult subjects 
on concomitant MTX.  
In  all  phases,  the  overall  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  adalimumab  achieving  a  PedACR30 2 
response was lower in AAA positive patients compared with AAA negative patients. In the OL LI, the 
overall  proportion  of  patients  treated  with  adalimumab  achieving  a  PedACR30  response  at  week  16 
was lower in AAA positive patients (12 of 19, 63%)  compared with AAA negative patients (132 of 
152, 87%). Also in the DB phase, the overall proportion of patients treated with adalimumab achieving 
a PedACR30 response at week 48 was lower in AAA positive patients (6 of 14, 43%) compared with 
AAA negative patients (35 of 54, 65%). In the OLE FD phase at week 16, the overall proportion of 
patients treated with adalimumab achieving a PedACR30 response in AAA positive patients (12 of 17, 
71%) compared with AAA negative patients (79/89, 89%). Overall, presence of AAA did not affect 
safety. 
The  high  number  of  anti-adalimumab  antibodies  in  children  without  MTX  is  of  concern  and  the 
incidence  appears  considerably  higher  than  observed  in  adults.  Furthermore,  the  data  show  that 
presence of AAA was associated with reduced effect.  
2 PedACR30  (American  College  of  Rheumatology  Paediatric  30)  is  a  standardised  outcome  measure  to  assess  relative 
efficacy in clinical trials, i.e., a measure of disease activity in JIA. It is defined as a 30% improvement in a minimum of three 
variables in the core set with worsening of one variable by no more than 30%. The ACR Paediatric 20, ACR Paediatric 50, 
ACR Paediatric 70, and ACR Paediatric 90 measures are also used as outcome measures in paediatric trials, and are defined 
as 20%, 50%, 70%, 90% improvement respectively in a minimum of three variables in the core set with worsening of one 
variable by no more than 30%.

Clinical efficacy 
Study DE038 
Study DE038 was a  multicentre, phase III, randomised withdrawal, double-blind, stratified, parallel-
group study in children and adolescents (4 to 17 years old) with polyarticular JIA. Stratification into 
two  groups,  MTX-treated  or  non-MTX-treated,  was  made  prior  to  study  enrollment.  Subjects  in  the 
MTX stratum were treated concomitantly with MTX during the study and the current dose of MTX 
was to have been stable for at least 3 months prior to screening. Subjects who were in the non-MTX 
stratum were either naïve to MTX or had been withdrawn from MTX at least two weeks prior to study 
drug administration and were not treated concomitantly with MTX during the study.  
The  study  had  four  phases.  During  the  first  three  of  these,  adalimumab  was  given  at  a  dose  of 
24 mg/m2 of BSA (up to a maximum total body dose of 40 mg) sc eow. The phases are listed below 
and table 1 presents the number of subjects in each phase of the study: 
1.  a 16-week open-label lead-in (OL LI) phase, (24 mg/m2 BSA eow sc. N: 171) 
2.  a 32-week double blind (DB) phase, (24 mg/m2 BSA eow sc – or – placebo. N: 133) 
3.  an open-label extension BSA dose (OLE BSA) phase. (24 mg/m2 BSA eow sc. N: 128).  
4.  an open label extension fixed dose (OLE FD) phase in which subjects had their dose changed 
from a regimen based on BSA to a fixed dose regimen. (20 mg or 40 mg FD eow sc. N: 106). 
The randomised withdrawal from study drug occurred at week 16 of the OL LI phase. Patients with a 
PedACR30  response  were  randomised  within  their  stratum  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  placebo  or  adalimumab 
during  the  32-week  DB  phase  of  the  study.  Subjects,  who  experienced  disease  flare  during  the  DB 
phase,  and  those  who  completed,  were  eligible  to  immediately  enroll  into  the  open  label  extension 
BSA (OLE BSA) phase.  
Subjects  in  the  OLE  BSA  phase  at  the  time  of  approval  of  the  OLE  FD  protocol  amendment  were 
eligible to receive a fixed dose of either 20 mg or 40 mg eow adalimumab based on their body weight. 
Duration of participation in the OLE BSA phase varied for each subject.  
The  OLE  FD  phase  was  implemented  to  gather  safety  and  efficacy  data  on  a  fixed  dosing  regimen 
based  on  body  weight.  In  this  phase,  subjects  with  a  body  weight  below  30  kg  received  20  mg 
adalimumab eow and subjects with a body weight equal or above 30 kg received 40 mg adalimumab 
eow. Subjects may continue the OLE FD phase for a maximum of five years or up to sixty days post 
marketing approval of the JIA indication in their respective country.

The CHMP considered the design of the pivotal study as acceptable, although complicated. For ethical 
reasons,  a  withdrawal  design  is  acceptable  and  has  also  been  previously  recognised  in  JIA  trials. 
Inclusion  of  both  MTX-  and  a  non-MTX  strata,  allows  for  a  comparison  of  monotherapy  and 
combination  therapy  with  MTX;  which  is  of  clinical  value.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  efficacy 
evaluation was undertaken when subjects were treated with the BSA dose regimen, although the MAH 
applied for a fixed dose, based on body weight. The fixed dose was only studied during a 16 weeks 
open phase. 
Subject Population 
The  main  inclusion  criteria  were  subjects  between  4  and  17  years  with  a  diagnosis  of  polyarticular 
course  JIA  as  defined  by  the  ACR  criteria.  Subjects  were  to  have  had  continuing  active  disease 
defined  as  ≥  5  swollen  joints  and  ≥  3  joints  with  limitation  of  passive  motion  joint  count  (LOM). 
Disease  onset  may  have  been  systemic,  polyarticular,  or  pauciarticular.  If  the  disease  was  systemic 
onset, subjects were to be free of any systemic JIA manifestations for at least three months before the 
time of qualification. Subjects were to have been either naïve to MTX, inadequate responders to MTX, 
or intolerant to MTX. Subjects who were refractory to MTX after 3 months of treatment were to have 
active  disease  after  3  months  prior  to  enrollment.  The  duration  of  disease  was  to  have  been  at  least 
long enough for a subject to be given an adequate test of NSAIDs. Subjects were not to have received 
other DMARDs for at least four weeks prior to receiving the 1st dose of study drug and were to have 
demonstrated  active  disease  prior  to  a  minimum  four  weeks  (28  days)  washout  of  all  DMARDs. 
Subjects  were  not  to  have  received  an  intra-articular  glucocorticoid  injection  within  four  weeks  (28 
days)  prior  to  enrollment  into  the  study.  Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  the  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria as acceptable.  
Efficacy Variables 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  adalimumab-treated  subjects  in  the  non-MTX 
stratum  who  experienced  disease  flare  in  the  DB  phase.  The  criteria  for  disease  flare  were  both  a 
≥30% worsening in at least 3 out of 6 JIA core set criteria and also a minimum of two active joints and 
≥30% improvement in not more than one of the six JIA core set criteria. The DB baseline was used as 
the reference point for the disease flare calculation.  
The following JIA core set of variables were used to determine disease flare:  
•  Physician's Global Assessment of subject's disease severity by VAS (Visual analog scales) 
•  Parent's Global Assessment of subject's overall well-being by VAS 
•  Number of active joints (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with LOM and with 
pain, tenderness or both) 
•  Number of joints with LOM 
•  DICHAQ (disability Index of the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire) 
•  CRP (C-reactive protein) - Change in CRP from baseline was evaluated for clinical improvement 
or worsening only if at least one of the CRP values, baseline value, or the visit value was outside 
the normal reference range.  
Among  secondary  efficacy  variables,  there  were  a  number  related  to  disease  flare,  as  well  as 
assessment of PedACR30/50/70/90 responses. The PedACR30 response in OL LI phase and DB phase 
was defined as ≥30% improvement in at least 3 of the JIA core set of criteria and ≥30% worsening in 
not more than one of the JIA core set. The PedACR50/70/90 in the DB phase were defined similarly to 
the PedACR30 using improvement percentages of 50, 70, and 90, respectively, while the worsening 
percentage criteria was kept unchanged at 30%. 
Baseline disease characteristics  
In the OL LI and the OLE BSA phases, there were no statistically significant differences in baseline 
disease  characteristics  between  treatment  groups  or  within  the  respective  strata.  Different  ages  were 
reasonably  well  represented  in  the  two  groups.  For  all  parameters  describing  disease  activity,  there 
was  a  tendency  towards  more  active  disease  in  the  non-MTX  treated  group.  This  was  not  found 
surprising  as  a  non-treated  population  is  more  likely  to  have  more  active  disease  than  a  population 
with active disease despite MTX.

Statistical Methods 
The statistical methods used were considered appropriate.  
Dose selection  
The controlled part of study was undertaken with a dose of 24 mg/m2   BSA. The MAH justified the 
proposed  fixed  dose  regimens  since  individualised  dosing  based  on  BSA  could  be  disadvantageous 
because: 1) patients/parents may attempt to re-use a dosage unit intended for single use and thereby 
increase the potential for infection; 2) additional efforts are needed to calculate the individualised dose 
and administer the correct volume from the single use dosage unit. 
Results 
Main efficacy endpoints  
Open label lead in phase (OLE LI)  
The response rate, defined as PedACR30, during this phase was high in both groups, 80/85 (94%) with 
MTX  and  64/86  (74%)  without  MTX. There  were  more  responders  among  the  patients  with  "active 
disease  despite  MTX"  compared  with  patients  without  MTX,  which  indicate  an  increased  efficacy 
with combination therapy. Six patients in the non-MTX stratum discontinued treatment due to lack of 
efficacy,  but  none  in  the  MTX  group.  Of  those  who  completed  the  OLE  LI,  8  (9%)  from  the  MTX 
group and 19 (22%) from the non-MTX group did not continue into the DB phase. This indicates that 
monotherapy was insufficient to achieve adequate response in certain individuals. 
There were 27 subjects, who were PedACR responders at the end of the OL LI phase but who were 
not enrolled into the DB phase. The submitted LOCF analysis was questioned when considering the 
long-term treatment, the chronic disease intended and the paediatric contest. 
Due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation (drop out for any reason, missing values 
and LOCF), the results of the primary efficacy analysis were questioned. It was considered that in the 
DB phase, a proportion of patients who were in the placebo arm may improve, also after a flare. The 
imputation assumes there will be no further improvement and could weaken the control arm. Because 
more  patients  drop  out  of  the  placebo  condition  than  the  adalimumab  arm,  imputation  (particularly 
LOCF)  results  in  a  bias  in  favour  of  the  alternative  hypothesis.  After  further  to  discussions  it  was 
concluded that short term efficacy was demonstrated for adalimumab, but due to the trial design, the 
superiority  of  adalimumab  over  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  JIA  may  be  overestimated.  It  was 
considered of importance to collect efficacy data in the ‘real-world’ practice. The MAH agreed to set 
up a registry in JIA patients (see Attachment 10, letter of undertaking). The secondary objective of this 
registry will be to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of Humira in JIA patients who are treated as 
recommended  in  the  approved  product  information.  Patients  treated  with  MTX  will  be  considered  a 
reference group. Additionally, section 4.2 of the SPC contains the statement ‘Available data suggest 
that clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment.  Continued therapy should be 
carefully reconsidered in a patient not responding within this time period.’ which should reduce the 
risk that patients not responding receive continued treatment. 
Double blind phase – primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with disease flare in the non-MTX population in 
the  DB  phase.  A  statistically  significantly  lower  proportion  of  adalimumab-treated  subjects 
demonstrated  disease  flare  compared  to  placebo-treated  subjects  in  the  non-MTX  stratum  (43%  for 
adalimumab vs. 71% for placebo; p = 0.031) as well as in the MTX stratum (37% for adalimumab vs 
65% for placebo; p= 0.015). The CHMP noted that in both strata, the numbers of patients with flares 
in  these  enriched  populations  given  continuous  active  treatment  during  the  treatment  period  of 
32 weeks, was rather high, 43% in the adalimumab group and 37% in the MTX + adalimumab group. 
Long-term efficacy may thus be questioned. The rather high number of flares may also suggest that 
there  was  a  considerable  placebo  response  with  the  defined  response  criteria  during  the  LI  phase. 
Logistic regression analyses showed no influence of prior use of NSAIDs or corticosteroids on disease 
flare.

Among  the  secondary  endpoints,  time  to  disease  flare  was  statistically  different  in  favour  of  the 
adalimumab treated groups in both strata. It was more than 32 weeks in both adalimumab groups, and 
14 – 20 weeks for subjects who received placebo (both strata). Further, it was noted that there were at 
least 21/65 patients in the placebo-treated groups without disease flare during the 32-week treatment 
period, in addition to the patients on placebo who flared after a treatment free period of several weeks. 
In the group of patients who had a treatment free period, the safety profile following reintroduction of 
adalimumab was presented in detail. Among patients with no flare during the DB phase, a tendency 
towards more injection site reactions was found, but also a lower number of infections. These data are 
however, very limited due to a low number of patients. More knowledge on the risks and/or loss of 
efficacy in patients who interrupt treatment and restart again was considered important and should be 
collected in e.g. the registry. Clarifications that data from week 36 to week 48 in the adalimumab arm 
were not based on LOCF were provided. 
In  the  analysis  of  PedACR30  responders  at  week  48,  the  result  for  the  non-MTX  group  was  not 
statistically  significant.  The  endpoint  PedACR30  responders  in  the  MTX  strata  reached  statistical 
significance in favour of adalimumab, the observed difference between placebo and active in the two 
strata  was  the  same;  25%.  PedACR30  values  tended  to  decrease  over  time,  relatively  parallel  in  all 
four  groups,  with  a  slightly  higher  decline  in  the  placebo  groups.  For  the  measures  PedACR50/70 
(indicating  a  higher  degree  of  improvement),  the  CHMP  noted  that  there  appeared  to  be  a  tendency 
towards a better effect with the MTX+adalimumab combination.  
Long-term efficacy  
All subjects who completed 32 weeks of DB phase or experienced a flare were eligible to receive OL 
adalimumab during the OLE BSA phase. Due to the study design, subjects had different durations of 
exposure during the OLE BSA phase. There were only five subjects with exposure of 136 weeks. The 
CHMP  noted  this  limited  amount  of  data  following  longer  term  treatment,  and  that  the  numbers  of 
treated patients decreased over time in the open BSA phase, partly due to recruitment of patients into 
the FD regimen.  
Initially only 16 weeks data from the FD phase was included. It was concluded that, since individuals 
were treated in an open setting with the fixed dose, evaluation of efficacy of the fixed dose was not 
possible.  Further  to  answers  to  outstanding  issues  data  for  the  fixed  dose period  up  to  week  64  was 
submitted. However, given the few subjects included, and the open design, these data were considered 
of limited value.  
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
One  pivotal  trial  was  performed  to  study  efficacy  and  safety  in  children  aged  4-17  years,  with 
polyarticular  JIA.  The  table  2  below  shows  an  overview  of  the  study.  An  open  initial  phase  study 
design, including two strata (non-MTX and MTX), followed by a double-blind withdrawal phase was 
chosen  mainly  from  the  ethical  point  of  view.  However,  this  design  may  not  be  optimal  to  prove 
efficacy. The study population was adequate as well as the chosen clinical endpoints.

In the open initial phase of the study, the response rate, according to the predefined 30% improvement 
criteria, was 94% with MTX + adalimumab and 74% in the group given adalimumab without MTX. 
There  were  more  responders  among  the  patients  with  "active  disease  despite  MTX"  (i.e.  the  group 
given  combination  therapy)  compared  with  patients  without  MTX,  and  more  patients  without  MTX 
discontinued the open phase, which indicates an increased efficacy with combination therapy.  
The  primary  endpoint,  proportion  of  subjects  with  disease  flare  in  the  non-MTX  stratum  during  the 
DB phase, was statistically significantly in favour of adalimumab. The same result was shown in the 
MTX stratum. However, due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation the results of the 
primary efficacy analysis were questionable. It was accepted that adalimumab prevents disease flares 
compared  to  placebo  but  due  to  the  trial  design,  the  superiority  of  adalimumab  over  placebo  in  the 
treatment  of JIA  may  be overestimated.  The  current  measures  should  reduce  the  risk  of  patients  not 
responding: the product information advises caution if a patient does not respond within 12 weeks of 
treatment; furthermore, a registry aiming to collect more data in this regard will be set up.  
The MAH applied for two fixed doses, with a weight cut off of 30 kg, despite that the controlled phase 
of the study was undertaken with BSA dosing. It was concluded that the available data with the fixed 
doses was insufficient, both in terms of efficacy and safety (see section 3.24 on clinical safety), due to 
the open label treatment in a limited number of subjects. Following assessment of the responses to the 
first set of questions raised, it remains evident that only BSA dosing has been adequately documented. 
The MAH provided a justification for use of a fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years, which 
was  endorsed.  For  younger  children,  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  that  there  is  sufficient  evidence  to 
support a fixed dose regimen. Consequently, there was a need for a syringe that can reassure accurate 
dosing for younger children. The MAH did not find it possible to currently provide such syringe, and 
therefore  withdrew  a  claim  (section  4.1  and  4.2)  for  children  below  13  years  of  age.  The  CHMP 
considered  it  disappointing  that  younger  children  would  not  be  addressed  in  the  indication  and 
posology,  due  to  such  reason,  but  the  approach  was  accepted.  The  CHMP  agreed  on  describing  the 
clinical study in section 5.1 of the SPC, including the age of the patients studied and dose regimens 
used. 
There  were  tendencies  of  better  efficacy  in  the  combination  group  compared  with  the  group  given 
adalimumab monotherapy. In the initial OL LI phase a higher percentage of responders were found in 
the  MTX-group,  94  %,  versus  74%  in  non-MTX  group.  In  addition,  the  number  of  discontinuations 
was  higher  in  the  non-MTX  during  the  initial  phase,  and  there  was  a  higher  number  of  responders 
achieving  the  more  stricter  Ped  ARC50/70  criteria  in  the  combination  group.  Anti-adalimumab 
antibodies developed in a higher number in the non-MTX group, 26% versus 6%, which also raised 
concerns  regarding  long  term  efficacy.  Further,  the  pharmacokinetic  data  indicate  a  higher 
adalimumab plasma level in the combination group. Overall, these data support combination therapy 
with MTX, and therefore combination therapy is the primary recommendation for this indication. 
Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  adalimumab  was  determined  through  evaluation  of  AEs  (adverse  events),  clinical 
laboratory  evaluations,  physical  examinations,  and  vital  signs.  In  addition,  TNF  −  inhibitor  related 
AEs of interest were evaluated: infections, serious infections, malignancies, opportunistic infections, 
tuberculosis  (TB),  demyelinating  disorders,  lupus  −  like  syndrome,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF), 
allergic reactions, injection site reactions, haematologic events, and hepatic events.  
Patient exposure 
In the OL LI phase and the DB phase, there were 55 subjects exposed to adalimumab, corresponding 
the  44  patients  years  (PYs).  During  the  subsequent  open  label  phases,  exposure  corresponded  to 
118 PYs. The table 3 below shows an overview of the safety analysis set for the FD phase.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
There  were  no  deaths,  malignancies,  congestive  heart  failure  (CHF),  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
demyelinating  diseases,  opportunistic  infections,  serious  blood  dyscrasias,  or  lupus-like  reactions 
reported in the study DE038. 
Overall, 35 subjects reported 55 SAEs of which most were mild to moderate in severity. There were 
9 SAEs  that  were  reported  as  severe  of  which  3  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  at  least 
the  OL  LI  phase  and 
possibly  related 
bronchopneumonia was reported during the OLE BSA phase; both events were reported for subjects in 
the non- MTX stratum. The third event, herpes zoster was reported for a subject in the MTX stratum 
during the OLE BSA phase. These events were resolved and the subjects continued in the study. Eight 
events were related to infections and three cases of appendicitis were reported. 
to  study  drug.  Pneumonia  was  reported  during 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug 
Twelve subjects reported AEs that lead to the discontinuation of study drug. Nine AEs were reported 
in  the  OL  LI  phase.  Disease  flare  occurred  in  7/12  (whereof  5  in  non-MTX,  OL  LI),  one  had 
leucopenia, two infections (pneumoniae) and one dizziness. One individual in the MTX stratum was 
discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  elevated  transaminases  approximately  2  months  after  first  drug 
administration.  
Laboratory findings 
No  new  safety  signals  were  found  from  changes  in  laboratory  parameters  during  the  phases  of  the 
study.

Discussion on clinical safety 
The  CHMP  concluded  that  there  were  no  new  safety  signals  in  the  treated  children/adolescents 
compared  with  the  already  well  known  safety  profile  in  adults.  Infections  were  the  most  common 
events,  as  for  adults.  No  cases  of  death,  malignancies,  CHF,  CNS  demyelinating  diseases, 
opportunistic infections, serious blood dyscrasias, or lupus-like reactions were  reported. However, it 
was noted that the database is very small, and long-term safety cannot be assessed. In this regard, the 
main  concerns  are  the  development  of  malignancies.  Regarding  the  fixed  dose  regimens  applied  for 
there is very limited safety data to assess possible implications of the dose changes, particularly in the 
younger children. In the FD phase of the study, a substantial number of patients, mainly in the lower 
age groups (and early Tanner stages) received an increased dose of ≥10 mg with the FD regimen. This 
is of concern, since no data are available to properly assess whether an increased dose is of any benefit 
to  the  young  child,  or  to  assess  neither  short-term  nor  long-term  safety,  in  the  younger  children. 
Further,  it  appears  that  the  number  of  subjects  with  any  AE  was  higher  (67.9%)  in  the  group  who 
received  an  increased  adalimumab  dose  vs.  those  who  stayed  on  the  same  or  decreased  the  dose 
(47.2%). The difference was particularly evident for infectious AEs irrespective to the MTX stratum.  
The MAH provided some further comparisons on the safety profile in patients with or without disease 
flare  during  the  double-blind  phase.  There  was  a  tendency  towards  more  injection  site  reactions  in 
subjects  without  flare,  but  also  a  lower  number  of  infections.  These  data  are  very  limited.  More 
knowledge on risks and/or loss of efficacy from patients who interrupt treatment and restart again is of 
importance, and should be followed in the registry.  
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted a risk management plan (RMP), which covered all approved indications as well 
as the indication which was under evaluation (JIA).  
The risk minimisation activities for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product as defined in 
the annex II are applicable to this new indication. The new version (4.0) of the risk management plan 
was reflected in the annex II. 
A  summary  of  the  RMP  for  adalimumab  highlighting  the  safety  concerns  with  adalimumab  is 
presented below:

Children < 4 years of 
age for JIA indications 
Incidence of JIA in children below 4 
years is low. However, data for 
children from age 2 onwards will be 
collected in a compassionate use study 
(Study M10-444) followed by data 
from the JIA registry (P10-262). 
Section 4.2 of the SPC addresses the 
lack of information in paediatric 
patients. As data in this paediatric 
populations (less than 4 years) are 
collected and submitted this 
information will be included in the 
SPC once available. A planned clinical 
trial for these paediatric patients will 
provide safety and efficacy 
information for this group. Routine 
pharmacovigilance combined with the 
results of clinical trials will 
characterize the overall safety of 
paediatric patients and adalimumab 
use. Safety findings will be 
communicated in future PSURs and 
updates will be made to the CCDS and 
SPC as necessary. 
Section 4.6 currently addresses the 
risks to women who may become 
pregnant or are lactating while being 
treated with adalimumab. It also 
addresses the risk to infants who are 
exposed in utero or via breast milk.  
Section 4.2 of the SPC indicates that 
adalimumab has not been studied in 
this patient populations and that there 
are no specific recommendations about 
the dose or the use of adalimumab in 
these patients.   
Warning regarding concomitant use 
with anakinra and abatacept is

Benefit risk assessment 
One  pivotal  study  was  performed  with  adalimumab  in  children/adolescents  aged  4-17  years  with 
polyarticular  JIA.  Subjects  were  stratified  according  to  MTX  use  or  no  MTX  (either  naïve  or 
intolerant).  Initially,  there  was  an  open  label  lead-in  phase  where  all  patients  received  adalimumab, 
24 mg/m2  BSA.  Week  16,  responders  were  randomised  into  a  double-blind  withdrawal  phase  of 
32 weeks,  where  the  primary  endpoint  (the  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  non-MTX  stratum  with  a 
disease  flare)  was  assessed.  In  this  phase,  58  subjects  were  enrolled  into  the  non-MTX  stratum  and 
75 into the MTX-stratum. The design was chosen from ethical reasons, but disadvantages in proving 
efficacy were noted. The study population and clinical endpoints were adequate. 
After the blinded phase, patients could continue on open label BSA dosing. Thereafter, patients were 
switched to open label fixed dosing of 20 mg (subjects up to 30 kg body weight) or 40 mg (> 30 kg) 
eow. The MAH initially proposed fixed dosing across the indication but this was not agreed with by 
the CHMP.  The data presented allowed fixed dose of 40 mg from the age of 13 years. For younger 
Page 17 of 19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
children,  dosing  based  on  BSA  was  recommended.  However,  the  MAH  has  not  yet  developed  a 
presentation which allows for the accurate dosing according to BSA, and therefore the indication was 
restricted to adolescents 13-17 years of age.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall,  following  the  BSA-based  dosing  in  juvenile  subjects  (24  mg/m2  with  a  maximum  dose  of 
40 mg eow) steady-state serum concentrations obtained in subjects with JIA appeared to be within the 
range of those previously observed in adult subjects (40 mg eow in RA, AS and PsA patients), both 
during monotherapy and concomitant methotrexate treatment. There was a tendency for a higher inter-
individual variability in juvenile subjects compared with adults. In addition, during monotherapy the 
immunogenicity  rate  was  higher  in  juvenile  subjects  than  in  adults,  which  may  explain  the  larger 
variability. During concomitant methotrexate treatment the serum levels were on average higher and 
the  variability  was  lower.  Furthermore,  the  number  of  subjects  developing  AAA  was  lower  when 
MTX was given concomitantly compared with monotherapy (5.9 vs. 25.6%).  
On  the  basis  of  data  from  study  DE038  PK  modelling  was  undertaken  to  support  the  fixed  dose 
regimens applied for. However, due to deficiencies in the model building and also in assessing how 
well the model simulates data, the pharmacokinetic documentation did not at present contribute in the 
assessment of safety and efficacy of the fixed dosing strategy. The conclusions made on the basis of 
the  simulations  can  only  be  qualitative  and  those  made  could  have  been  foreseen  by  predicting  the 
dose change in various weight groups on the basis of correlation between BSA and weight as follows: 
a)  increased  exposure  for  children  weighing  15-20  kg,  30-40  kg  and  40-50  kg  with  the  largest 
difference for children weighing 30-40 kg, b) decreased exposure for children weighing 20-30 kg. The 
quantitative assessment was not considered appropriate as the population model did not fit to the data 
and the predictive properties of the model were not assessed properly.  
Benefit  
In the open initial phase, the response rate, according to the predefined 30% improvement criteria, was 
94%  with  MTX  +  adalimumab  and  74%  in  the  adalimimab  monotherapy  group.  There  were  more 
responders  among  the  patients  with  "active  disease  despite  MTX"  (i.e.  the  group  given  combination 
therapy) compared with patients without MTX, and more patients without MTX discontinued the open 
phase,  which  indicate  an  increased  efficacy  with  combination  therapy.  Therefore  it  was  considered 
that  combination  therapy  is  the  primary  recommendation,  but  in  case  of  MTX  intolerance, 
monotherapy might be an option.  
During the blinded withdrawal phase, the primary endpoint, proportion of subjects with disease flare 
in  the  non-MTX  stratum,  as  well  as  the  same  endpoint  in  the  MTX  stratum,  was  statistically 
significantly in favour of adalimumab, but due to the low threshold for flare and the use of imputation 
the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  were  questionable.  It  was  accepted  that  adalimumab 
prevents disease flares compared to placebo in the non-MTX stratum. However, due to the trial design, 
the  superiority  of  adalimumab  over  placebo  in  the  treatment  of  JIA  may  be  overestimated.  It  was 
considered  of  importance  to  collect  efficacy  data  in  the  registry  setting,  which  the  MAH  agreed  to 
undertake (see Attachment 10, letter of undertaking).  
The  MAH  applied  for  two  fixed  doses,  with  a  weight  cut  off  of  30  kg,  despite  the  fact  that  the 
controlled  phase  of  the  study  was  undertaken  with  BSA  dosing.  It  was  concluded  that  the  available 
data with the fixed doses was insufficient, both in terms of efficacy and safety, due to the open label 
treatment in a limited number of subjects. A justification for use of a fixed dose of 40 mg from the age 
of 13 years was agreed with. However, due to lack of a syringe that can reassure accurate dosing for 
younger children, where BSA dosing needs to be applied, the use in children less than 13 years cannot 
be recommended for approval. The indication was revised accordingly.  
There  are  tendencies  of  better  efficacy  in  the  combination  group  compared  with  the  group  given 
adalimumab  monotherapy.  In  the  initial  open  lead-in  phase  a  higher  percentage  of  responders  were 
found  in  the  MTX-group,  94  %,  versus  74%  in  non-MTX  group.  In  addition,  the  number  of 
discontinuations was higher in the non-MTX during the initial phase, and there was a higher number 
of  responders  achieving  the  more  stricter  Ped  ARC50/70  criteria  in  the  combination  group.  Anti-
Page 18 of 19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab antibodies developed in a higher number in the non-MTX group, 26% versus 6%, which 
also raises concerns regarding long term efficacy. Finally, the pharmacokinetic data indicate a higher 
adalimumab plasma level in the combination group. Overall, these data support combination therapy 
with MTX. This is resolved by adequate descriptions in the SPC, including that combination therapy is 
the primary recommendation in the indication. 
Risk  
No alarming safety signals were found in the performed study. No cases of death, malignancies, CHF, 
CNS demyelinating diseases, opportunistic infections, serious blood dyscrasias, or lupus-like reactions 
were reported. However, the data base is very  small, and long-term safety cannot be assessed; main 
concerns being development of malignancies. In terms of the fixed dose regimens applied for, there is 
very limited safety data to assess possible implications of the dose changes, particularly in the younger 
children.  The  additional  data  from  open  label  fixed  dose  use  up  to  64  weeks  are  still  insufficient, 
particularly  for  the  smallest  and  youngest  population.  Thus,  in  terms  of  safety,  there  is  insufficient 
support for the fixed dose regimens applied for.  
Overall,  the  RMP  is  acceptable.  The  MAH  agreed  to  develop  a  registry  where  both  safety  and 
effectiveness data will be collected, which is endorsed. The MAH will follow subjects for 5 years for 
all  events  specified  in  the  Registry  protocol  and  an  additional  5-years  on  an  annual  basis  to  collect 
events of Congestive Heart Failure and Malignancies.  
Benefit / Risk Balance  
Efficacy has been sufficiently demonstrated with the body surface area dosing of 24 mg/m2. There are 
tendencies of better efficacy with a combination of adalimumab and MTX. The indication was revised 
and  combination  therapy  with  MTX  is  the  primary  option.  A  fixed  dose  of  40  mg  from  the  age  of 
13 years  was  agreed.  Due  to  lack  of  an  appropriate  dosing  device,  no  claim  for  children  less  than 
13 years of age is made.  
The  safety  profile  demonstrated  in  the  study  shows  no  unexpected  findings,  but  long-term  safety 
remains  a concerns. To conclude, the benefit / risk balance for the treatment of subjects aged 13-17 
years, with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, who have inadequate response to one or 
more DMARDs, was considered positive.  
The changes to the product information were agreed with, including the update of the annexes in line 
with the latest QRD template.  
The conditions as detailed before remained unchanged. However, the annex II was updated to clearly 
mention  the  new  indication  (JIA)  and  to  include  the  new  version  of  the  RMP  approved  with  this 
indication.  
CONCLUSION 
On  24  July  2008  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the summary of product characteristics and package leaflet.

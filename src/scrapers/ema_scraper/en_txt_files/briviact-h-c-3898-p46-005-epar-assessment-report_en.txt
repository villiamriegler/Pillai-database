1.  Introduction 
In the EU, brivaracetam (BRV) is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of 
age with epilepsy.  
Brivaracetam is a 2-pyrrolidone derivative, (2S)-2-[(4R)-2-oxo-4-propyltetrahydro-1H-pyrrol-1-
yl]butanamide), with a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a 
transmembrane glycoprotein found at presynaptic level in neurons and endocrine cells shown to 
modulate exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Binding to SV2A is hypothesized to be the primary 
mechanism for the anticonvulsant activity of BRV. 
On 19 November 2019, the MAH submitted an Article 46 paediatric dossier for study N01125, which 
was completed on 28 May 2019, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
According to the MAH, N01125 was a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, long-term follow-up (LTFU) 
study to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of BRV used as adjunctive treatment at a flexible dose 
up to a maximum of 200mg/day in study participants aged 16 years or older diagnosed with epilepsy 
or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). An abbreviated clinical study report (CSR) based on a clinical 
cutoff date of 17 Jan 2014 was previously submitted for N01125 for the purpose of providing 
supportive information for the BRV partial-onset seizures (POS) adjunctive therapy Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) submission. The MAH has now provided the final CSR based on the 
completed study. 
In the study N01125, a total of 7 patients were under the age of 18 at the time of informed consent.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Oral film-coated tablets of BRV 2,5 mg, 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg were used. The batch numbers are 
provided in a table 3.3 of the CSR. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
For the current submission, the MAH submitted a clinical overview, summarizing the disposition and 
TEAEs for the 7 participants from N01125 who were <18 years old at the time of informed consent  
in order to fulfil the requirement of reporting paediatric data as outlined in Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). The MAH also submitted a final report for study N01125 
providing data from the overall participant population.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
N01125: a Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study to evaluate 
the long-term safety and efficacy of brivaracetam (BRV) used as adjunctive treatment at a 
flexible dose up to a maximum of 200mg/day in study participants aged 16 years or older 
diagnosed with epilepsy or Unverricht- Lundborg disease (ULD). 
Description 
A Phase 3, open-label, multicenter, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study to evaluate long-term safety and 
efficacy of BRV used as adjunctive treatment at a flexible dose up to a maximum of 200mg/day in 
study participants aged 16 years or older diagnosed with epilepsy or Unverricht- Lundborg disease 
(ULD). 
Methods 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of BRV at individualized 
doses with a maximum of 200mg/day in participants suffering from epilepsy. 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the maintenance of efficacy over time of BRV (for 
POS/primary generalized seizure [PGS] participants). However, no efficacy objectives were defined for 
participating patients with ULD. 
The exploratory objectives were to explore the impact on health-related quality of life, as well as to 
collect data on medical resources used and on indirect costs. 
Study design 
N01125 was an open-label, single-arm, multinational, multicenter, non-comparative, long-term follow-
up (LTFU) study to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy of BRV used as adjunctive treatment at a 
flexible dose up to a maximum of 200mg/day in study participants aged 16 years or older diagnosed 
with epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). The study population of N01125 consisted of 
participants 16 years of age and older with epilepsy from the previous studies N01114, N01187, 
N01236, N01252, N01315 and N01254, mainly with POS, a minority with generalized epilepsy (from 
N01254), and ULD (from N01187, N01236).   
Assessor’s comment 
There were 6 feeding studies for N01125 with a total of 1250 patients with partial-onset and or 
generalized epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease. Overall, all of these studies had a very minor 
quota of participants under 18 years of age. Of the seven patients under scrutiny in this submission, 5 
had partial-onset epilepsy (POS) and 2 Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD).    
The following study periods were defined: 
•  Evaluation Period (visit 1 until the last evaluation period visit or early discontinuation visit), 
considered in 3-month periods. The visit 1 was performed on the same day as the last visit of 
the previous study in which the participant was enrolled 
•  Down-titration period: if the study participant was discontinuing study drug, the Investigator 
planned an early discontinuation visit and the progressive down-titration of study drug, during 
which the drug dose may have been decreased in steps of a maximum of 50mg/day on a 
weekly basis 
EMA/CHMP/691193/2019 
Page 4/13 
 
 
 
•  Post-treatment period (2 to 4 weeks): after completion of the down-titration period, the study 
participant entered a post-treatment period for a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 4 
weeks, followed by a final visit 
The individual starting dose for each participant was the dose recommended at the end of their 
previous study. The recommended maximum dose of BRV at the outset was 400mg/day; however, all 
participants had doses less than 200 mg/day at the stage when the protocol was amended to allow for 
a maximum dose of BRV 150mg/day (Protocol Amendment 1, 01 Apr 2005) and subsequently for that 
of BRV 200mg/day (Protocol Amendment 25, 03 Jan 2011) in participants with epilepsy. Daily 
administration in 2 equal intakes was recommended. Dose adjustment of study drug and/or 
concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or antimyoclonic drugs was allowed at any time to improve 
seizure control if needed or in case of a safety or tolerability issue.  
Discontinuation of treatment with BRV was marked by a Down-Titration Period: the dose of BRV was 
decreased in steps of a maximum of 50mg/day on a weekly basis with a last down titration step at 
20mg/day for 1 week. Participants who completed the Down-Titration Period entered a Post-Treatment 
Period for a minimum of 2 weeks and a maximum of 4 weeks and subsequently, the final visit 
occurred. Dose adjustment to concomitant AEDs may have been made at any time during the study 
and participants may have started new AEDs. Concomitant AEDs may have also been discontinued 
however, special considerations applied if the discontinuation of such AEDs resulted in the participant 
receiving BRV monotherapy. Before Substantial Protocol Amendment 24, in the event of excellent 
efficacy and tolerability of BRV, withdrawal of concomitant AEDs resulting in monotherapy of BRV may 
have been attempted by the Investigator. With Substantial Protocol Amendment 24, conversion to 
monotherapy was no longer permitted; however, participants already on BRV monotherapy were 
allowed to continue on monotherapy. For each study participant, the study ran throughout the duration 
of the clinical development period of BRV, and continued until a marketing authorization was granted 
by any Health Authority in an indication for the adjunctive treatment in adults with refractory POS, 
whether or not secondarily generalized, until the Sponsor decided to close the study, until a managed 
access program, named patient program, compassionate use program, or similar type of access 
program was established as allowed per country-specific requirement in addition to legal and 
regulatory guidelines, or until BRV development was stopped by the Sponsor. The study duration for 
each participant was variable; the maximum study duration was 14 years.  
Study population /Sample size 
The study N01125 enrolled male or female study participants with partial onset epileptic seizures, aged 
16 years or older, who had completed the Treatment Period in brivaracetam trials allowing access to 
this study (N=853). The Investigator could enrol subjects whom he/she expected to reasonably benefit 
from the long-term administration of BRV. Study participants with severe medical, neurological, and 
psychiatric disorders, including current suicidal ideation or behaviour, or laboratory values which may 
have had an impact on the safety of the study participant, as determined by the Investigator, were 
excluded, as well as subjects who had shown poor compliance in the previous trial or were 
participating in any clinical trial of another investigational drug or device concomitantly, and females of 
childbearing potential without a medically accepted contraceptive method in use. 
Treatments 
Study participants were continued on the individual BRV starting doses which was for each patient the 
dose that was recommended at the end of their previous study. They were maintained at this dose for 
at least 2 weeks, unless the study participant was not able to tolerate treatment. The BRV dose could 
subsequently have been adjusted based on the individual study participant’s seizure control and/or 
EMA/CHMP/691193/2019

tolerability. The recommended maximum dose of BRV at the outset was 400mg/day; however, all 
participants had doses less than 200 mg/day at the stage when the protocol was amended to allow for 
a maximum dose of BRV 150mg/day (Protocol Amendment 1, 01 Apr 2005) and subsequently for that 
of BRV 200mg/day (Protocol Amendment 25, 03 Jan 2011) in participants with epilepsy. Daily 
administration in 2 equal intakes was recommended. Dose adjustment of study drug and/or 
concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or antimyoclonic drugs was allowed at any time to improve 
seizure control if needed or in case of a safety or tolerability issue.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
The safety variables of N01125 were the following:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
occurrence of adverse events 
laboratory tests (blood, urinalysis) 
vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate) and body weight 
electrocardiogram (ECG) 
physical and neurological examinations 
plasma concentration of brivaracetam and concomitant AEDs 
The primary efficacy variable was based on the seizure frequency per week for partial onset seizures 
(type I) by 3-month periods over the Evaluation Period.  
The secondary efficacy variables were the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
seizure frequency (all three types) per 3-month periods during the Evaluation Period 
proportion of seizure-free days (all three types) per 3-month periods during the Evaluation 
Period  
continuously seizure-free subjects for all seizures (all three types) by 3-month period over the 
Evaluation Period. 
responder rate for POS (Type I) frequency over the Evaluation Period. A responder was defined 
as a participant with a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency from the Baseline Period of the 
previous study 
The exploratory variables were the following: 
•  Health-Related Quality of Life (QOLIE-31-P) at month 3, at every yearly evaluation visit or at 
early discontinuation visit 
•  medical resources used by 3-month period over the Evaluation Period, including health care 
provider consultations not foreseen by the protocol, concurrent medical procedures, 
concomitant medications and hospitalizations 
• 
indirect costs by 3-month period over the Evaluation Period, including workdays or schooldays 
lost and days lost due to inability to perform a usual activity (excluding paid work) 
EMA/CHMP/691193/2019 
Page 6/13 
 
 
 
 
Statistical Methods 
All efficacy, safety and demographic variables were summarized by descriptive statistics. 
Seizure frequency for all seizures was derived as the number of seizures standardized to a seven-day 
period, calculated as the number of seizures over the period, divided by the number of days in that 
period and multiplied by 7. 
Percent reduction from Baseline for POS frequency was summarized by quantitative descriptive 
statistics for the categories of overall duration of exposure and by 3-month time intervals over the 
Evaluation Period. Similar summaries were provided for the full cohort interval and by 3-month time 
intervals for each exposure duration cohort and previous study cohort.  
Responders over the Evaluation Period were defined as study subjects with ≥50% reduction in seizure 
frequency per week from baseline. A similar calculation was applied to each 3-month time interval over 
the Evaluation Period and for the cohort interval for each exposure duration cohort. Responder rate 
was summarized by 3-month periods. The maintenance of the efficacy over time was evaluated by 
means of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses.  
The safety was analysed by summarizing by categories of total duration of exposure, including study-
emergent adverse events. Abnormalities in clinical examinations and ECG were listed by period and 
visit. Separate tables were produced for adverse events leading to withdrawal and for those classified 
as serious (SAE), all categorized by duration of exposure. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The total number of recruited patients to the study N01125 was 853 participants, of which 729 were 
included in the POS efficacy analysis set, 30 in the primary generalized seizure (PG) category analysis 
set, and 94 to ULD efficacy analysis set.  
Of the 7 study participants who were <18 years of age at the time of informed consent in N01125, 5 
were POS patients and 2 were ULD patients. The 7 patients formed the paediatric safety analysis set. A 
summary of patient disposition and study completion is given in the table below. Out of the 7, 3 
subjects completed whereas 4 subjects discontinued the study, 2 of these because of lack of efficacy.

(Safety Analysis Set) 
Data source: Table 1.2.P 
Baseline data 
The mean age for the participants in this safety analysis set was 16.6 years (range 16 -17 years). 
There were 5 male (71.4%) and 2 female (28.6%) subjects. Five subjects were white (71.6%), two of 
Asian race (28.6%). Overall, mean weight and height were 61.4 kg and 162.4 cm. Body mass index 
(BMI) category was in the range 18.5-25 kg/m2 for 4 subjects (57.1%), between 25-30 kg/m2 for 2 
participants (28.6%), and between 30-40 kg/m2 for 1 subject (14.3%); no participants were in the 
BMI categories of <18.5 kg/m2 or ≥40 kg/m2. 
The mean duration of epilepsy for participants <18 years of age in the POS efficacy analysis set was 
6.1 years (range 2-13 years), and the mean age at time of first seizure was 10.9 years (range 5-15 
years). All subjects <18 years of age in the POS efficacy analysis set reported partial seizures at any 
time prior to entry into the preceding double-blind studies, including simple partial seizures (2 
participants [40.0%]), complex partial seizures (4 participants [80.0%]), and partial evolving to 
secondary generalized seizures (5 participants [100.0%]). One subject (20.0%) <18 years of age 
reported generalized seizures prior to entry into the preceding double-blind studies.  
At the baseline of the previous study, in the POS patients >18 years of age, the classification of the 
epileptic syndrome POS Efficacy Analysis Set, the classification of epileptic syndrome was unknown for 
1 subject (20.0%) whereas 4 subjects had localization-related epileptic syndromes, the majority of 
which were symptomatic (3 participants [60.0%]) and one cryptogenic (1 participant [20.0%]). In this 
set, 2 participants (40.0%) had known seizure focus localization, in both cases temporally located, at 
the baseline of the previous double-blind study. The aetiology of epilepsy was unknown in two 
participants (40.0%) in the POS Efficacy Analysis Set, and the known aetiologies were congenital 
malformation, perinatal asphyxia and cerebral infection (1 subject with each one aetiology [20.0%]).  
EMA/CHMP/691193/2019 
Page 8/13 
 
 
       
 
Of the study participants <18 years of age with POS, 1 patient (20.0%) had taken either 0 to 1 AED, 3 
patients had taken 2 to 4 AEDs (60.0%), and 1 patient (20.0%) had taken ≥5 AEDs. At entry into the 
preceding double-blind study, all 5 patients were taking at least 1 AED, including lamotrigine and 
sodium valproate/valproic acid (3 subjects [60.0%] each), followed by levetiracetam, and 
oxcarbazepine (2 subjects [40.0%] each) and topiramate (1 subject [20.0%]). 
Efficacy results 
At the individualized doses up to a maximum of 200mg/day in participants <18 years of age with 
POS, administration of BRV resulted in the following results in the 5 subjects of the POS Efficacy 
Analysis Set: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
during the Evaluation Period, participants reported a median (Q1, Q3) POS frequency of 
6.3 (2.0, 12.6) seizures per 28-day period, ranging from 0 to 540 seizures, compared with 
baseline median (Q1, Q3) POS frequency of 12.6 (9.5, 50.1) seizures per 28-day period, 
ranging from 4 to 510 seizures  
during the Evaluation Period, participants reported a median (Q1, Q3) reduction in POS 
frequency from Baseline of 33.6% (-0.4%, 91.1%) per 28-day period. The mean (SD) 
reduction in POS frequency during the Evaluation Period was 42.9% (48.7%) per 28-day 
period  
the 50% responder rate for POS frequency during the Evaluation Period for participants with 
POS was 40.0% (2/5 participants). Two participants maintained their 50% responder status 
through 99 months with 1 study participant maintaining their responder status through 135 
months 
seizure-freedom for any continuous 6-month period of treatment was reported for two 
subjects, one being seizure free for up to 60 months 
Assessor’s comment 
No efficacy objectives were understandably defined for ULD.  Consequently, the paediatric 
population in the long-term follow-up does not allow us to make statistical conclusions but serves 
as a series for a directional assessment of safety and tolerability.    
Safety results 
All subjects in the <18 years of age Safety Analysis Set (7 participants [100%]) received at least 1 
dose of BRV. Total participant-years of exposure was 32.6 years. 
The most common modal doses of BRV were 150mg/day (3 participants [42.9%]) and 100mg/day (2 
participants [28.6%]). One subject (14.3%) each received a modal dose of 50mg/day and 200mg/day. 
No subjects received a modal dose of BRV ≤20mg/day or ˃200mg/day. 
Most of the participants (5 participants [71.4%]) had at least 6 months of exposure to BRV, 3 
participants (42.9%) had at least 96 months of exposure to BRV, and 1 participant (14.3%) completed 
at least 138 months of treatment.

Summary of TEAEs 
A summary of the incidence of TEAEs in participants <18 years of age is presented in the table below. 
All 7 participants <18 years of age reported at least 1 TEAE (100.0% [63 events]), roughly 
consistently with the overall population (n=720 [84.4%]). Of the 63 events reported, 29 were reported 
in subjects with POS and 34 in subjects with ULD. Their incidence was highest during the first 3-month 
safety interval. Approximately half of participants reported TEAEs with a maximum intensity of severe 
(4 subjects [57.1%]; 3 events in participants with POS and 1 event in a participant with ULD), one 
TEAEs of moderate and two of mild intensity (in the overall population the number of TEAEs of severe 
intensity was 216 [25.3%]). In the paediatric group, all severe TEAEs resolved without sequelae. One 
subject in this group (14.3%) experienced a TEAE leading to permanent discontinuation of the drug 
(aggression, that was deemed drug-related by the Investigator, in a subject with ULD).  
A total of 4 participants reported a TEAE that was considered by the Investigator to be drug-related 
(57.1% [15 events]; 5 events in 3 participants with POS and 10 events in 1 participant with ULD), 
including psychomotor irritability, weight decrease, myoclonus, aggression, and depression (1 subject 
[14.3%] each). None of the SAEs were considered drug-related by the Investigator (femur fracture, 
convulsion, depression). In the overall population, the number of treatment-emergent SAEs was 248 
(29.1%). 
A summary of TEAEs occurring in ≥2 of participants <18 years of age is given in the table below. 
EMA/CHMP/691193/2019

TEAEs of Interest 
Overall in participants <18 years of age, 2 subjects (28.6%) reported 2 TEAEs potentially associated 
with seizure worsening, convulsion in a subject (14.3%) with POS and grand mal convulsion in a 
subject (14.3%) with ULD. The TEAE of convulsion was deemed serious but neither of them were 
deemed drug-related or SAEs nor led to permanent discontinuation of the study drug. 
Two participants (28.6%) reported TEAEs potentially associated with behavioural disorders (single 
events of aggression and agitation in one subject and 6 events of aggression in another; both with 
ULD). As evaluated per safety time interval, the TEAEs of aggression were reported between months 1 
to 3, 7 to 9, 10 to 12, and 31 to 33 of exposure to BRV; the TEAE of agitation was reported between 
31 to 33 months of exposure. These TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and not serious, but one 
of the 6 TEAEs of aggression in one subject, deemed drug-related by the Investigator, led to 
permanent discontinuation of the study drug. 
One participant with POS (14.3%) reported a single TEAE potentially associated with cognitive 
impairment (amnesia) occurring after an unknown number of days after the first dose of BRV. It was 
mild in intensity, not considered serious or related to the study drug by the Investigator. 
Three participants (42.9%; two with POS, one with ULD) reported TEAEs potentially associated with 
suicidality or suicidal ideation, including depression (2 participants [28.6%], in one reported as severe, 
in the other as an SAE), overdose of valproate and suicidal ideation (1 subject [14.3%] each). None of 
these TEAEs led to permanent discontinuation of the study drug. 
No participants <18 years of age reported TEAEs potentially associated with hepatotoxicity or renal 
injury. Pregnancies were not reported. 
Three participants reported 7 TEAEs potentially associated with abuse potential: aggression and 
depression (two subjects [28.6%] each), as well as asthenia, somnolence, overdose, amnesia, and 
agitation (1 subject [14.3%] each). Events of aggression and depression were considered drug-related 
by the Investigator. One reported depression was severe but not considered drug-related, and all other 
TEAEs potentially associated with abuse potential were mild or moderate. One reported TEAE, 
aggression, led to permanent discontinuation of the study drug, as stated above.

Clinical laboratory evaluations 
No clinically meaningful findings were detected in the mean baseline hematology parameters or in the 
mean changes from baseline following the initiation of administration of BRV to the last value recorded 
in the Evaluation Period in participants <18 years of age. 
There were 2 participants reporting TEAEs associated with hematological parameters: anaemia (1 
subject), decreased white blood cell, monocyte and neutrophil counts in one (14.3%) subject. The 
latter TEAE was considered drug-related by the Investigator. Haematological parameters were not 
associated with SAEs or permanent discontinuation of the study drug. 
There were no meaningful findings reported as TEAEs in the baseline  blood chemistry parameters  by 
Baseline mean values or in the mean changes from Baseline to the last value recorded in the 
Evaluation Period. Possibly clinically significant treatment-emergent abnormalities post-baseline were 
reported in 1 study participant (14.3%) each: high alanine aminotransferase, high protein, high 
cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, and impaired glucose tolerance. These were not 
considered drug-related or serious, and they did not lead to permanent discontinuation of the study 
drug. In urinalysis, there were no relevant baseline findings, and possibly clinically significant 
treatment-emergent abnormalities were reported as follows: in two subjects (28.6%) ketone values, 
one subject (14.3%) protein values, and two urinary tract infections were reported by one participant. 
All TEAEs were of mild intensity and not considered serious or as related to the study drug. 
Vital signs, physical examination and ECG findings 
There were possibly clinically significant treatment-emergent abnormalities in diastolic blood pressure 
in 4 participants: low in one (14.3%) subject, high in three (42.9%) subjects. Heart rate values were 
high in three (42.9%) subjects. No significant ECG abnormalities were recorded during the study.   
Possibly clinically significant body weight values were common as judged by the age group-specific 
weight criteria (<3% or >97% of body weight growth curve ranges): post-baseline had 2 participants 
(28.6%) low body weight and 5 participants (71.4%) high body weight. Possibly clinically significant 
treatment-emergent values were observed as soon as 2 months after Visit 1 and as late as 10 years 
after. Actual TEAEs were reported in one subject (14.3%) each: weight decreased and weight 
increased, and these were considered drug-related by the Investigator. No TEAEs related to vital signs 
led to permanent discontinuation of study drug nor were they considered treatment-emergent SAEs.  
Assessor’s comment 
Of the primary SOCs of TEAEs, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders as well as TEAEs deemed 
severe have a seemingly higher representation by percentage among the patients <18 years of age in 
comparison with the adult population of the study N01125. However, considering the special 
characteristics of the cohort (adolescents, high relative proportion of ULD patients) and especially its 
minute size with a very high degree of contingency, the results are regarded as being in line with the 
overall study population.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
A total of 7 patients ≤18 years old were included in study N01125, which comprises approximately 
0.82 % of the total study population (n=853 patients). It is challenging to compare the study results 
between children and adults not least given the very limited number of children; however, the outcome 
for the patients in the age range 16-18 seems consistent with the result of the overall study 
population. 
All patients reported TEAEs (7 subjects; 100 %). One event in a series of events led to permanent 
discontinuation of study drug in one subject (14.4%). In the paediatric population, 4 (57.1%) of the 
TEAEs were deemed severe. There were 3 (42.9%) treatment-emergent SAEs in the paediatric group, 
unrelated to treatment. All reported frequencies are reasonably consistent and in line with the reported 
frequencies in the overall population. 
The safety profile of brivaracetam in the paediatric population is currently reflected in the SmPC. No 
new safety concerns were identified, and consequently, there is no need to update the product 
information based on this limited dataset. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The MAH submitted the results of N01125 in order to fulfil the requirement of reporting paediatric data 
as outlined in accordance with Article 46 of regulation (EC) no 1901/2006, as amended. The limited 
number and the character of the reported TEAEs in subjects ≤18 years of age does not raise new 
safety concerns. 
The MAH does not propose any changes of the currently approved SmPC based on the present data, 
which is supported. 
 Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

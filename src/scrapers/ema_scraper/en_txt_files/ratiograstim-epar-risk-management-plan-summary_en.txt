 Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for RATIOGRASTIM/TEVAGRASTIM 
(FILGRASTIM) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim 
(Filgrastim) (herein after also referred to as Filgrastim). The RMP details important risks of 
Filgrastim, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
Filgrastim 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Filgrastim 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Filgrastim should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Filgrastim should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Filgrastim's 
RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It is used for 
Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim is authorised to stimulate the production of white blood cells in the 
following situations: 
•  to reduce the duration of neutropenia (low levels of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) 
and the occurrence of febrile neutropenia (neutropenia with fever) in patients receiving 
chemotherapy (cancer treatment) that is cytotoxic (cell-killing);  
•  to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing treatment to destroy the bone 
marrow cells before a bone marrow transplant (such as in some patients with leukaemia) if 
they are at a risk of long-term, severe neutropenia;  
•  to increase levels of neutrophils and reduce the risk of infections in patients with neutropenia 
who have a history of severe, repeated infections;  
•  to treat persistent neutropenia in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) infection, to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other treatments are not 
appropriate.  
It can also be used in patients who are about to donate blood stem cells for transplant, to help 
release these cells from the bone marrow. 
It contains filgrastim as the active substance and it is given by injection or infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim’s benefits can be found in 
Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the 
EMA website, under the medicine’s webpages:

II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks  
Important risks of filgrastim, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about filgrastim’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Ratiograstim/Tevagrastim is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of filgrastim are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of filgrastim. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

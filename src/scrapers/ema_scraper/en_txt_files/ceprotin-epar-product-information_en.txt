1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
CEPROTIN 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Protein C from human plasma purified by mouse monoclonal antibodies. CEPROTIN 500 IU* is 
prepared as a powder containing nominally 500 IU human protein C per container. The product 
reconstituted with 5 ml of Sterilised Water for Injections contains approximately 100 IU/ml human 
protein C. 
The potency (IU) is determined using a chromogenic substrate method against the World Health 
Organisation (WHO) International standard. 
*One International Unit (IU) of protein C corresponds to the amidolytically measured activity of 
protein C in 1 ml of normal plasma. 
Excipients with known effect: 
This medicinal product contains 22.5 mg sodium per vial. 
For the full list of excipients see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Human protein C, powder and solvent for solution for injection. 
Lyophilised white or cream coloured powder or friable solid. After reconstitution the solution has a pH 
of between 6.7 and 7.3 and an osmolality of not lower than 240 mosmol/kg. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
 
CEPROTIN is indicated for prophylaxis and treatment of purpura fulminans coumarin-induced 
skin necrosis and venous thrombotic events in patients with severe congenital protein C 
deficiency.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with CEPROTIN should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in 
substitution therapy with coagulation factors/inhibitors where monitoring of protein C activity is 
feasible. 
Posology 
The dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory assessment for each individual case. 
Treatment of acute episodes and short-term prophylaxis (including invasive procedures)  
A protein C activity of 100 % (1 IU/ml) should be achieved initially and the activity should be 
maintained above 25 % for the duration of the treatment. 
An initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg for determination of recovery and half-life is advised. 
The measurement of protein C activity using chromogenic substrates is recommended for the 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
determination of the patient’s plasma level for protein C before and during treatment with 
CEPROTIN. 
The dosage should be determined on the basis of laboratory measurements of the protein C activity. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event these should be performed every 6 hours until the patient is 
stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It should be kept 
in mind that the half-life of protein C may be severely shortened in certain clinical conditions such as 
acute thrombosis with purpura fulminans and skin necrosis. 
If the response to CEPROTIN injection is satisfactory (measured by chromogenic assays), dosing may 
be gradually reduced to 12 hourly dosing ensuring trough protein C activity >25% (>0.25 IU/ml). 
Patients treated during the acute phase of their disease may display much lower increases in protein C 
activity. The wide variation in individual responses implies that the effects of CEPROTIN on 
coagulation parameters should be checked regularly. 
In patients receiving prophylactic administration of protein C, higher trough levels may be warranted 
in situations of an increased risk of thrombosis (such as infection, trauma, or surgical intervention). 
Long-term prophylaxis  
For the long-term prophylactic treatment, a dose of 45 to 60 IU/kg every 12 hours is recommended. 
Measurement of the protein C activity should be performed to ensure trough levels of 25% or more. 
Dose or frequency of infusions should be adjusted accordingly.  
In rare and exceptional cases, subcutaneous infusion of 250 - 350 IU/kg was able to produce 
therapeutic protein C plasma levels in patients with no intravenous access. 
Combination treatment  
If the patient is switched to permanent prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement is 
to be discontinued only when stable anticoagulation is obtained (see section 4.5). Furthermore, during 
the initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy it is advisable to start with a low dose and adjust this 
incrementally, rather than use a standard loading dose. 
At start of a combination treatment of anticoagulants (especially Vitamin K antagonists) with Protein 
C, stable activity levels of Protein C above 0.25 IU/ml (chromogenic) should be maintained before 
starting the anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is 
recommended. In the combination of Protein C Concentrate and -anticoagulants, a protein C trough 
level of about 10% or more is recommended to be maintained. 
 Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Based on the limited clinical experience in children from reports and studies covering 83 patients, 
dosing guidelines for adult subjects are considered valid for neonatal and paediatric patient population 
(see section 5.1). 
Activated Protein C (APC) resistance 
In patients with combined severe congenital protein C deficiency and with APC resistance, there are 
limited clinical data to support the safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN. 
Renal and/or hepatic impairment 
Safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment have not been 
established. Patients with any of these conditions should be monitored more closely. 
Method of administration 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CEPROTIN is administered by intravenous injection after reconstitution of the powder for solution for 
injection with Sterilised Water for Injections. 
CEPROTIN should be administered at a maximum injection rate of 2 ml per minute except for 
children with a body weight of < 10 kg, where the injection rate should not exceed a rate 
of 0.2 ml/kg/min. 
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. For the 
events that allergic symptoms arise which are of an acute and life-threatening nature, administration 
should be made within reach of life-supporting facilities. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section.6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse 
protein or heparin, except for control of life-threatening thrombotic complications. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
As the risk of an allergic type hypersensitivity reaction cannot be excluded, patients should be 
informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, 
tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, they 
should inform the physician. Immediate discontinuation of product use is advised. 
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment are to be observed. 
Inhibitors 
If the preparation is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency, antibodies inhibiting 
protein C may develop. 
Transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from 
human blood or plasma include selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infective agents cannot be totally excluded. 
This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV and 
for the non-enveloped virus HAV. 
The measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. 
Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic anaemia). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular / repeated 
receipt of human plasma-derived Protein C products. 
Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) 
CEPROTIN may contain trace amounts of heparin. Heparin induced allergic reactions, which can be 
associated with a rapid decrease of the number of thrombocytes, may be observed (HIT). In patients 
with HIT, symptoms such as arterial and venous thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC), purpura, petechiae and gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), may occur. If HIT is suspected, the 
number of thrombocytes should be determined immediately and if necessary, therapy with 
CEPROTIN should be stopped. Identifying HIT is complicated by the fact that these symptoms may 
already be present in acute phase patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency. Patients with 
HIT should avoid the use of heparin containing drugs in the future. 
Concurrent anticoagulant medication 
In the context of clinical experience several bleeding episodes have been observed. Concurrent 
anticoagulant medication (such as heparin) may have been responsible for these bleeding episodes. 
However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the administration of CEPROTIN further contributed 
to these bleeding events. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 22.5 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 1.1% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions with other medicinal products are currently known. 
Interaction with Vitamin K antagonists 
In patients starting treatment with oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K antagonists 
(e.g. warfarin), a transient hypercoagulable state may arise before the desired anticoagulant effect 
becomes apparent. This transient effect may be explained by the fact that protein C, itself a vitamin K 
dependent plasma protein, has a shorter half-life than most of the vitamin K dependent proteins 
(i.e. II, IX and X). Subsequently, in the initial phase of treatment, the activity of protein C is more 
rapidly suppressed than that of the procoagulant factors. For this reason, if the patient is switched to 
oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement must be continued until stable anticoagulation is obtained. 
Although Warfarin-induced skin necrosis can occur in any patient during the initiation of oral 
anticoagulant therapy, individuals with congenital protein C deficiency are particularly at risk. 
(See section 4.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Although CEPROTIN has been used safely in the treatment of pregnant protein C-deficient women, 
its safety for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. 
Furthermore, no information on excretion of protein C in the milk is available. Therefore, the benefit 
of using CEPROTIN during pregnancy or lactation must be judged against the risk for the mother and 
baby and should be used only if clearly needed. 
For information on parvovirus B19 infection, see section 4.4. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CEPROTIN has no influence or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
As with any intravenous product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Patients should 
be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which may include angioedema, burning 
and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, rash, pruritus, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, 
hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, and 
wheezing. Patients should be advised to immediately contact their physician if these symptoms occur 
(see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
During clinical studies with CEPROTIN, a total of 3 non-serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 
reported in 1 of 67 patients enrolled (rash and pruritus (grouped as hypersensitivity), and dizziness). In 
total 6375 administrations of CEPROTIN have been given. 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very

Mechanism of action 
Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant glycoprotein which is synthesised in the liver. It is 
converted by thrombin/thrombomodulin-complex on the endothelial surface to APC. APC is a serine 
protease with potent anticoagulant effects, especially in the presence of its cofactor protein S. APC 
exerts its effect by the inactivation of the activated forms of factors V and VIII which leads to 
a decrease in thrombin formation. APC has also been shown to have profibrinolytic effects. 
The intravenous administration of CEPROTIN provides for an immediate but temporary increase in 
plasma levels of protein C. Replacement of protein C in protein C deficient patients is expected to 
control or - if given prophylactically - prevent thrombotic complications. 
Clinical efficacy  
One prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, 3-part, phase 2/3 clinical study in subjects 
with severe congenital Protein C deficiency to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Protein C 
Concentrate was completed (pivotal study 400101). This study enrolled 18 subjects with severe 
congenital Protein C deficiency defined as protein C activity level <20% and with median age 5.8 
years (range 0 to 26 years). In the long-term prophylaxis group the median age was 2.8 years (range 0 
to 22 years). A total of 24 episodes of purpura fulminans (PF), coumarin-induced skin necrosis (CISN) 
and other vascular thromboembolic events were treated with CEPROTIN in 11 subjects. Seven 
courses of short-term prophylaxis prior to surgery or initiation of anticoagulation therapy 
and 8 courses of long-term prophylaxis were analysed. The results of this study demonstrate that 
CEPROTIN is efficacious for the treatment of acute thrombotic episodes and support the use of 
CEPROTIN for both short-term and long-term thrombotic prophylactic treatment. 
Other experience with CEPROTIN covers case reports and a clinical study in overall 69 paediatric 
patients with acquired protein C deficiency. The study is a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled dose-finding study, in the indication of acquired protein C deficiency due to 
meningococcal sepsis (IMAG 112). The reports suggest that CEPROTIN is well tolerated in children 
and small infants. 
Dosages of the above studies, covering 87 patients, indicate that dosing guidelines for adult subjects 
are also valid for neonatal and paediatric patient population. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
21 asymptomatic subjects with homozygous or double heterozygous protein C deficiency were 
evaluated for pharmacokinetic data. The protein C plasma activity was measured by chromogenic 
assay. The individual half-lives varied from 4.4 to 15.8 hours using a compartmental model and 
from 4.9 to 14.7 using the non-compartmental method. The individual incremental recovery ranged 
from 0.50 to 1.76 [(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)]. The patients differed significantly in age, body weight and 
plasma volume. 
In patients with acute thrombotic disease, both the incremental increase in protein C plasma levels as 
well as half-life may be considerably reduced. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Protein C contained in CEPROTIN is a normal constituent of human plasma and acts like endogenous 
protein C. Therefore, experimental studies on tumorigenic or mutagenic effects - particularly in 
heterologous species - are not considered necessary. 
Single dose toxicity testing showed that even doses of several times the recommended human dosage 
per kilogram body weight (10-fold) did not result in toxic effects on rodents. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CEPROTIN proved to have no mutagenic potential in the Ames test performed. 
Repeated toxicity studies were not conducted because prior experience with coagulation preparations 
had shown them to be of limited value. Difference between the recipient species and human protein C 
will inevitably result in an immune response with antibody formation.

The measurement of protein C activity using chromogenic substrates is recommended for the 
determination of the patient’s plasma level for protein C before and during treatment with 
CEPROTIN. 
The dosage should be determined on the basis of laboratory measurements of the protein C activity. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event these should be performed every 6 hours until the patient is 
stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It should be kept

Paediatric population 
Based on the limited clinical experience in children from reports and studies covering 83 patients, 
dosing guidelines for adult subjects are considered valid for neonatal and paediatric patient population 
(see section 5.1).

Renal and/or hepatic impairment 
Safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment have not been 
established. Patients with any of these conditions should be monitored more closely. 
Method of administration 
CEPROTIN is administered by intravenous injection after reconstitution of the powder for solution for 
injection with Sterilised Water for Injections. 
CEPROTIN should be administered at a maximum injection rate of 2 ml per minute except for 
children with a body weight of < 10 kg, where the injection rate should not exceed a rate 
of 0.2 ml/kg/min. 
As with any intravenous protein product, allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. For the 
events that allergic symptoms arise which are of an acute and life-threatening nature, administration 
should be made within reach of life-supporting facilities. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse 
protein or heparin, except for control of life-threatening thrombotic complications. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
As the risk of an allergic type hypersensitivity reaction cannot be excluded, patients should be 
informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, 
tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If these symptoms occur, they 
should inform the physician. Immediate discontinuation of product use is advised.  
In case of shock, the current medical standards for shock treatment are to be observed. 
Inhibitors 
If the preparation is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency, antibodies inhibiting 
protein C may develop. 
Transmissible agents 
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of medicinal products prepared from

pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective manufacturing steps for the 
inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood

This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV and HCV 
and for the non-enveloped virus HAV. The measures taken may be of limited value against 
non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be serious for pregnant 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
women (foetal infection) and for individuals with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis 
(e.g. haemolytic anaemia). 
Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for patients in regular / repeated 
receipt of human plasma-derived Protein C products. 
 Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) 
CEPROTIN may contain trace amounts of heparin. Heparin induced allergic reactions, which can be 
associated with a rapid decrease of the number of thrombocytes, may be observed (HIT). In patients 
with HIT, symptoms such as arterial and venous thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC), purpura, petechiae and gastrointestinal bleeding (melena), may occur. If HIT is suspected, the 
number of thrombocytes should be determined immediately and if necessary, therapy with 
CEPROTIN should be stopped. Identifying HIT is complicated by the fact that these symptoms may 
already be present in acute phase patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency. Patients with 
HIT should avoid the use of heparin containing drugs in the future. 
Concurrent anticoagulant medication 
In the context of clinical experience several bleeding episodes have been observed. Concurrent 
anticoagulant medication (such as heparin) may have been responsible for these bleeding episodes. 
However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the administration of CEPROTIN further contributed 
to these bleeding events. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains 44.9 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 2.2% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions with other medicinal products are currently known. 
Interaction with Vitamin K antagonists 
In patients starting treatment with oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K antagonists 
(e.g. warfarin), a transient hypercoagulable state may arise before the desired anticoagulant effect 
becomes apparent. This transient effect may be explained by the fact that protein C, itself a vitamin 
K dependent plasma protein, has a shorter half-life than most of the vitamin K dependent proteins 
(i.e. II, IX and X). Subsequently, in the initial phase of treatment, the activity of protein C is more 
rapidly suppressed than that of the procoagulant factors. For this reason, if the patient is switched to 
oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement must be continued until stable anticoagulation is obtained. 
Although Warfarin-induced skin necrosis can occur in any patient during the initiation of oral 
anticoagulant therapy, individuals with congenital protein C deficiency are particularly at risk. 
(See section 4.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Although CEPROTIN has been used safely in the treatment of pregnant protein C-deficient women, its 
safety for use in human pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials. Furthermore, 
no information on excretion of protein C in the milk is available. Therefore, the benefit of using 
CEPROTIN during pregnancy or lactation must be judged against the risk for the mother and baby and 
should be used only if clearly needed.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
As with any intravenous product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. Patients should 
be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions, which may include angioedema, burning 
and stinging at the injection site, chills, flushing, rash, pruritus, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, 
hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting and 
wheezing. Patients should be advised to immediately contact their physician if these symptoms occur 
(see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
During clinical studies with CEPROTIN, a total of 3 non-serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were 
reported in 1 of 67 patients enrolled (rash and pruritus (grouped as hypersensitivity), and dizziness). In 
total 6375 administrations of CEPROTIN have been given. The distribution of the related ADRs is as 
follows: 
Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very 
rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: group antithrombotic; ATC Code: B01AD12 
Mechanism of action 
Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant glycoprotein which is synthesised in the liver. It is 
converted by thrombin/thrombomodulin-complex on the endothelial surface to APC. APC is a serine 
protease with potent anticoagulant effects, especially in the presence of its cofactor protein S. APC 
exerts its effect by the inactivation of the activated forms of factors V and VIII which leads to 
a decrease in thrombin formation. APC has also been shown to have profibrinolytic effects. 
The intravenous administration of CEPROTIN provides for an immediate but temporary increase in 
plasma levels of protein C. Replacement of protein C in protein C deficient patients is expected to 
control or - if given prophylactically - prevent thrombotic complications. 
Clinical efficacy  
One prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, 3-part, phase 2/3 clinical study in subjects 
with severe congenital Protein C deficiency to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Protein C 
Concentrate was completed (pivotal study 400101). This study enrolled 18 subjects with severe 
congenital Protein C deficiency defined as protein C activity level <20% and with median age 5.8 
years (range 0 to 26 years). In the long-term prophylaxis group the median age was 2.8 years (range 0 
to 22 years). A total of 24 episodes of purpura fulminans (PF), coumarin-induced skin necrosis (CISN) 
and other vascular thromboembolic events were treated with CEPROTIN in 11 subjects. Seven 
courses of short-term prophylaxis prior to surgery or initiation of anticoagulation therapy 
and 8 courses of long-term prophylaxis were analysed. The results of this study demonstrate that 
CEPROTIN is efficacious for the treatment of acute thrombotic episodes and support the use of 
CEPROTIN for both short-term and long-term thrombotic prophylactic treatment. 
Other experience with CEPROTIN covers case reports and a clinical study in overall 69 paediatric 
patients with acquired protein C deficiency. The study is a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled dose-finding study, in the indication of acquired protein C deficiency due to 
meningococcal sepsis (IMAG 112). The reports suggest that CEPROTIN is well tolerated in children 
and small infants. 
Dosages of the above studies, covering 87 patients, indicate that dosing guidelines for adult subjects 
are also valid for neonatal and paediatric patient population. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
21asymptomatic subjects with homozygous or double heterozygous protein C deficiency were 
evaluated for pharmacokinetic data. The protein C plasma activity was measured by chromogenic 
assay. The individual half-lives varied from 4.4 to 15.8 hours using a compartmental model and 
from 4.9 to 14.7 using the non-compartmental method. The individual incremental recovery ranged 
from 0.50 to 1.76 [(IU/dL)/(IU/kg)]. The patients differed significantly in age, body weight and 
plasma volume. 
In patients with acute thrombotic disease, both the incremental increase in protein C plasma levels as 
well as half-life may be considerably reduced. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Protein C contained in CEPROTIN is a normal constituent of human plasma and acts like endogenous 
protein C. Therefore, experimental studies on tumorigenic or mutagenic effects - particularly in 
heterologous species - are not considered necessary. 
Single dose toxicity testing showed that even doses of several times the recommended human dosage 
per kilogram body weight (10-fold) did not result in toxic effects on rodents. 
CEPROTIN proved to have no mutagenic potential in the Ames test performed. 
Repeated toxicity studies were not conducted because prior experience with coagulation preparations 
had shown them to be of limited value. Difference between the recipient species and human protein C 
will inevitably result in an immune response with antibody formation.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CEPROTIN is and what it is used for 
CEPROTIN belongs to a class of medicines called antithrombotics. This medicine contains Protein C, 
a natural protein that is made in the liver and is present in your blood. Protein C plays a major role in 
prevention of excessive clot formation thus, prevent and/or treat intravascular thrombosis. 
CEPROTIN is used in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic and haemorrhagic skin lesions 
(named purpura fulminans) in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency. CEPROTIN may 
also be used in the treatment and prevention of a rare complication of a blood thinner medicine 
(anticoagulant medicine named coumarin) which may result in severe skin lesion (necrosis). 
Additionally, CEPROTIN may be used in the treatment of blood clot (venous thrombotic) events. 
2.  What you need to know before you use CEPROTIN 
Do not use CEPROTIN 
- 
if you are allergic to human protein C or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) including mouse protein or heparin. 
However, in the case of life-threatening thrombotic complications your doctor may still decide to 
continue treatment with CEPROTIN. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using CEPROTIN. Take special care with CEPROTIN if 
symptoms of allergy occur. Symptoms of allergy include rash, hives, breathing difficulties, low blood 
pressure, tightness of chest, and shock. If such symptoms occur during the administration of 
CEPROTIN, injection should be stopped. Such symptoms may constitute an allergic reaction to any 
of the components, to mouse protein or heparin. The preparation may contain traces of heparin 
and/or mouse protein as a result of the manufacturing process. If such a reaction occurs, your doctor 
will decide on the most appropriate treatment. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the preparation is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency, antibodies inhibiting 
protein C may develop that can inhibit protein C and therefore diminish the effect of the preparation. 
However, this has not been observed in the clinical studies to date. 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to 
make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools 
of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, when 
medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other 
types of infections. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. 
Parvovirus B 19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or 
haemolytic anaemia). 
Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived Protein C products. 
Other medicines and CEPROTIN 
No interactions with other medicinal products are currently known. 
Nevertheless, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
If you change to treatment with oral anticoagulants, treatment with CEPROTIN must continue until 
the blood level of the oral anticoagulation is adequate and stable. 
CEPROTIN with food and drink 
Not applicable. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will decide if CEPROTIN may be used during pregnancy and lactation. 
Driving and using machines 
CEPROTIN has no influence on your ability to drive or to operate machines. 
CEPROTIN contains Sodium 
This medicine contains 22.5 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 1.1% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How to use CEPROTIN 
CEPROTIN is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein). It is given to you 
under close supervision of your doctor who is experienced in substitution therapy of coagulation 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factors/inhibitors and where monitoring of protein C activity is possible. Dosage will vary depending 
on your condition and your body weight. 
Dosage 
The dose, administration frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of the protein C 
deficiency as well as on your clinical condition and on your plasma level of protein C. They should be 
adjusted accordingly on the basis of clinical effectiveness and laboratory assessment. 
Treatment of acute episodes and short-term prophylaxis  
A protein C activity of 100 % (1 IU/ml) should be achieved initially and the activity should be intained 
above 25 % for the duration of the treatment. 
An initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg should be administered. Your physician will take several blood 
drawings over time to determine how long protein C is remaining in your body. 
The measurement of protein C activity using chromogenic substrates is recommended for the 
determination of your plasma level for protein C before and during treatment with CEPROTIN. 
The dosage should be determined on the basis of laboratory measurements of the protein C activity. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event these should be performed every 6 hours until your condition 
is stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It should be kept 
in mind that the half-life of protein C may be severely shortened in certain clinical conditions such as 
acute thrombosis with purpura fulminans and skin necrosis. 
If the response to CEPROTIN injection is satisfactory, dosing may be gradually reduced to 12 hourly 
dosing ensuring trough protein C activity >25%. 
If you receive prophylactic administration of protein C, higher trough levels may be warranted in 
situations of an increased risk of thrombosis (such as infection, trauma, or surgical intervention). 
Long-term prophylaxis  
For the long-term prophylactic treatment, a dose of 45 to 60 IU/kg every 12 hours is recommended. 
Measurement of the protein C activity should be performed to ensure trough levels of 25% or more.  
In rare cases, subcutaneous infusion of 250 - 350 IU/kg has produced therapeutic plasma protein C 
levels in patients with no intravenous access. 
If you have kidney and/or liver disease, please inform your doctor, because he may have to adjust your 
treatment accordingly. 
Combination treatment  
If you are switched to permanent prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement is to be 
discontinued only when stable anticoagulation is obtained (see “Important information about some of 
the ingredients of CEPROTIN”). 
At start of a combination treatment of anticoagulants (especially Vitamin K antagonists) with Protein 
C, stable activity levels of Protein C above 0.25 IU/ml should be maintained before starting the 
anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is recommended. In 
the combination of Protein C Concentrate and anticoagulants, a Protein C trough level of about 10% or 
more is recommended to be maintained. 
If you have APC resistance which is a thromboembolic risk factor present in up to 5 % of the 
population in Europe your doctor may need to adjust your treatment accordingly. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Administration 
CEPROTIN will be administered to you by intravenous injection after reconstitution of the powder for 
solution for injection with Sterilised Water for Injections. It is strongly recommended that every time 
you receive a dose of CEPROTIN the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to 
maintain a record of the batches used. 
Reconstitute lyophilised CEPROTIN powder for solution for injection, with the supplied solvent 
(Sterilised Water for Injections) using the sterile transfer needle. Gently rotate the vial until all powder 
is dissolved. 
After reconstitution, the solution is drawn through the sterile filter needle into a sterile disposable 
syringe. A separate unused filter needle must be used to withdraw each vial of reconstituted 
CEPROTIN. The solution should be discarded if particulate matter is visible. 
The reconstituted solution should be administered immediately by intravenous injection. 
CEPROTIN should be administered at a maximum injection rate of 2 ml per minute. In children with 
a body weight of less than 10 kg, the injection rate should not exceed a rate of 0.2 ml/kg/min. 
All unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes must be discarded appropriately. 
Frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of your protein C deficiency, on the 
results of determination of protein C levels in your plasma as well as on the location and extent of 
thrombosis. 
In case of acute thrombosis CEPROTIN may be administered to you every 6 hours. As the tendency 
for thrombus formation decreases, the frequency may be reduced. 
If you use more CEPROTIN than you should

Possible side effects 
How to store CEPROTIN 
Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What CEPROTIN is and what it is used for 
CEPROTIN belongs to a class of medicines called antithrombotics. This medicine contains Protein C, 
a natural protein that is made in the liver and is present in your blood. Protein C plays a major role in 
prevention of excessive clot formation thus, prevent and/or treat intravascular thrombosis. 
CEPROTIN is used in the treatment and prevention of thrombotic and haemorrhagic skin lesions 
(named purpura fulminans) in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency. CEPROTIN may 
also be used in the treatment and prevention of a rare complication of a blood thinner medicine 
(anticoagulant medicine named coumarin) which may result in severe skin lesion (necrosis). 
Additionally, CEPROTIN may be used in the treatment of blood clot (venous thrombotic) events.  
2.  What you need to know before you use CEPROTIN 
Do not use CEPROTIN 
- 
if you are allergic to human protein C or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) including mouse protein or heparin. 
However, in the case of life-threatening thrombotic complications your doctor may still decide to 
continue treatment with CEPROTIN. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using CEPROTIN. Take special care with CEPROTIN if 
symptoms of allergy occur. Symptoms of allergy include rash, hives, breathing difficulties, low blood 
pressure, tightness of chest, and shock. If such symptoms occur during the administration of 
CEPROTIN, injection should be stopped. Such symptoms may constitute an allergic reaction to any 
of the components, to mouse protein or heparin. The preparation may contain traces of heparin and/or 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mouse protein as a result of the manufacturing process. If such a reaction occurs, your doctor will 
decide on the most appropriate treatment. 
If the preparation is used in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency, antibodies inhibiting 
protein C may develop that can inhibit protein C and therefore diminish the effect of the preparation. 
However, this has not been observed in the clinical studies to date. 
When medicines are made from human blood or plasma, certain measures are put in place to prevent 
infections being passed on to patients. These include careful selection of blood and plasma donors to 
make sure those at risk of carrying infections are excluded, and the testing of each donation and pools 
of plasma for signs of virus/infections. Manufacturers of these products also include steps in the 
processing of the blood or plasma that can inactivate or remove viruses. Despite these measures, 
when medicines prepared from human blood or plasma are administered, the possibility of passing on 
infection cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to any unknown or emerging viruses or other 
types of infections. 
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, and for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus. The 
measures taken may be of limited value against non-enveloped viruses such as parvovirus B19. 
Parvovirus B 19 infection may be serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
whose immune system is depressed or who have some types of anaemia (e.g. sickle cell disease or 
haemolytic anaemia). 
Your doctor may recommend that you consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B if you 
regularly/repeatedly receive human plasma-derived Protein C products. 
Other medicines and CEPROTIN 
No interactions with other medicinal products are currently known. 
Nevertheless, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other 
medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription. 
If you change to treatment with oral anticoagulants, treatment with CEPROTIN must continue until 
the blood level of the oral anticoagulation is adequate and stable. 
CEPROTIN with food and drink 
Not applicable. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor will decide if CEPROTIN may be used during pregnancy and lactation. 
Driving and using machines 
CEPROTIN has no influence on your ability to drive or to operate machines. 
CEPROTIN contains Sodium 
This medicine contains 44.9 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each vial. This is 
equivalent to 2.2% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How to use CEPROTIN 
CEPROTIN is intended for intravenous administration (infusion into a vein). It is given to you under 
close supervision of your doctor who is experienced in substitution therapy of coagulation 
factors/inhibitors and where monitoring of protein C activity is possible. Dosage will vary depending 
on your condition and your body weight. 
Dosage 
The dose, administration frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of the protein C 
deficiency as well as on your clinical condition and on your plasma level of protein C. They should be 
adjusted accordingly on the basis of clinical effectiveness and laboratory assessment. 
Treatment of acute episodes and short-term prophylaxis  
A protein C activity of 100 % (1 IU/ml) should be achieved initially and the activity should be 
maintained above 25 % for the duration of the treatment. 
An initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg should be administered. Your physician will take several blood 
drawings over time to determine how long protein C is remaining in your body. 
The measurement of protein C activity using chromogenic substrates is recommended for the 
determination of your plasma level for protein C before and during treatment with CEPROTIN. 
The dosage should be determined on the basis of laboratory measurements of the protein C activity. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event these should be performed every 6 hours until your condition 
is stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It should be kept 
in mind that the half-life of protein C may be severely shortened in certain clinical conditions such as 
acute thrombosis with purpura fulminans and skin necrosis. 
If the response to CEPROTIN injection is satisfactory, dosing may be gradually reduced to 12 hourly 
dosing ensuring trough protein C activity >25%. 
If you receive prophylactic administration of protein C, higher trough levels may be warranted in 
situations of an increased risk of thrombosis (such as infection, trauma, or surgical intervention). 
Long-term prophylaxis  
For the long-term prophylactic treatment, a dose of 45 to 60 IU/kg every 12 hours is recommended. 
Measurement of the protein C activity should be performed to ensure trough levels of 25% or more.  
In rare cases, subcutaneous infusion of 250 - 350 IU/kg has produced therapeutic plasma protein C 
levels in patients with no intravenous access.  
If you have kidney and/or liver disease, please inform your doctor, because he may have to adjust your 
treatment accordingly. 
Combination treatment 
If you are switched to permanent prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants, protein C replacement is to be 
discontinued only when stable anticoagulation is obtained (see “Important information about some of 
the ingredients of CEPROTIN”). 
At start of a combination treatment of anticoagulants (especially Vitamin K antagonists) with Protein 
C, stable activity levels of Protein C above 0.25 IU/ml should be maintained before starting the 
anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) is recommended. In 
the combination of Protein C Concentrate and anticoagulants, the Protein C trough level of about 10% 
or more is recommended to be maintained. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have APC resistance which is a thromboembolic risk factor present in up to 5 % of the 
population in Europe your doctor may need to adjust your treatment accordingly. 
Administration 
CEPROTIN will be administered to you by intravenous injection after reconstitution of the powder for 
solution for injection with Sterilised Water for Injections. It is strongly recommended that every time 
you receive a dose of CEPROTIN the name and batch number of the product are recorded in order to 
maintain a record of the batches used. 
Reconstitute lyophilised CEPROTIN powder for solution for injection, with the supplied solvent 
(Sterilised Water for Injections) using the sterile transfer needle. Gently rotate the vial until all powder 
is dissolved. 
After reconstitution, the solution is drawn through the sterile filter needle into a sterile disposable 
syringe. A separate unused filter needle must be used to withdraw each vial of reconstituted 
CEPROTIN. The solution should be discarded if particulate matter is visible. 
The reconstituted solution should be administered immediately by intravenous injection. 
CEPROTIN should be administered at a maximum injection rate of 2 ml per minute. In children with 
a body weight of less than 10 kg, the injection rate should not exceed a rate of 0.2 ml/kg/min. 
All unused solution, empty vials and used needles and syringes must be discarded appropriately. 
Frequency and duration of treatment depend on the severity of your protein C deficiency, on the 
results of determination of protein C levels in your plasma as well as on the location and extent of 
thrombosis. 
In case of acute thrombosis CEPROTIN may be administered to you every 6 hours. As the tendency 
for thrombus formation decreases, the frequency may be reduced. 
If you use more CEPROTIN than you should 
It is recommended that you adhere to the dose level and frequency of administration as recommended 
by your doctor. In case you administered more CEPROTIN than recommended, please inform your 
doctor as soon as possible. 
If you forget to use CEPROTIN 
Not applicable. 
If you stop using CEPROTIN 
Do not stop using CEPROTIN without consulting your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

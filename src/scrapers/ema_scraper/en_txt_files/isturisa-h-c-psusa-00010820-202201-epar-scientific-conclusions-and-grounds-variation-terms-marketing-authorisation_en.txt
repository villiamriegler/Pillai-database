Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for osilodrostat, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on myalgia and arthralgia from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, and in view of a 
plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between osilodrostat and 
myalgia and arthralgia is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product 
information of products containing osilodrostat should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for osilodrostat the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing osilodrostat is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

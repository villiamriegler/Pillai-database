CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Remimazolam is indicated in adults for procedural sedation. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Remimazolam must only be administered by healthcare professionals experienced in sedation. The 
patient should be monitored throughout by a separate healthcare professional, who is not involved in 
the conduct of the procedure, and whose sole task is to monitor the patient. This personnel must be 
trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation and apnoea, including 
the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation and cardiovascular resuscitation. The 
patient´s respiratory and cardiac function must be continuously monitored. Resuscitative medicinal 
products and age- and size-appropriate equipment for restoring airway patency and bag/valve/mask 
ventilation must be immediately available. A benzodiazepine reversal medicinal product (flumazenil) 
must be immediately available for use.  
Posology 
Remimazolam dosing should be individually titrated to an effective dose which provides the desired 
level of sedation and minimises adverse reactions (see Table 1). Additional doses can be administered 
as needed to induce or maintain the desired level of sedation. At least 2 minutes should elapse prior to 
administration of any supplemental dose in order to fully assess the sedative effect. If 5 doses of 
remimazolam within 15 minutes do not result in the desired level of sedation then an additional or 
another sedative should be considered. Remimazolam is associated with fast onset and offset of 
sedation. In clinical trials, peak sedation occurred 3-3.5 minutes after the initial bolus and patients 
became fully alert 12-14 minutes from last dose of remimazolam.

Opioid co-administered medicinal products are known to increase the sedative effect of remimazolam 
and to depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).

# American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status 
Special populations 
Elderly, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) III-IV patients and patients 
with body weight < 50 kg 
Elderly patients and patients with ASA-PS III-IV may be more sensitive to the effects of sedatives. 
Before administration of remimazolam a careful assessment of the overall condition of patients 
≥65 years of age and/or with ASA-PS III-IV, especially with low body weight (< 50 kg), is therefore 
of particular relevance when deciding upon individualised dosage adjustments for these patients (see 
sections 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in any grade of renal impairment (including patients with glomerular 
filtration rate [GFR] < 15 mL/min).  
Hepatic impairment 
The metabolising enzyme (carboxylesterase-1 [CES-1]) for remimazolam is predominantly located in 
the liver and the clearance of remimazolam is affected by increasing stages of hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh scores 5 and 6) 
or moderate (Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh scores 10 to 15; data from only 3 subjects in clinical trials), the clinical effects may be 
more pronounced and last longer than in healthy subjects. No dose adjustments are required but 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
careful attention should be paid to the timing of titration doses and remimazolam should be carefully 
titrated to effect in these patients (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of remimazolam in children and adolescents aged 0 to ˂18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Remimazolam is for intravenous use. Remimazolam must be reconstituted before use with sodium 
chloride (0.9%) solution for injection.  
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, and on 
administration with other fluids see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other benzodiazepines or any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Unstable myasthenia gravis. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardiorespiratory adverse reactions 
Cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have been reported with the use of remimazolam, including 
respiratory depression, bradycardia and hypotension. Remimazolam administration can be associated 
with a transient increase in heart rate (10-20 beats per minute) starting as early as 30 seconds after the 
start of dosing (corresponding to the time of maximum concentration of remimazolam) before 
resolving within about 30 minutes after the end of administration. This increase in heart rate coincides 
with a decrease in blood pressure and it may confound QT correction for heart rate translating into a 
small prolongation in QTcF in the first few minutes following dosing.  
Special attention is required for elderly patients (≥65 years of age), for patients with impaired 
respiratory and/or cardiac function or for patients with poorer general health status (see section 4.2). 
Concomitant use of opioids  
Concomitant use of remimazolam and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, 
coma and death. In patients with longer-term opioid use, caution is advised; it should not be presumed 
that these effects will be attenuated (see section 4.5).  
Concomitant use of alcohol / CNS depressants  
The concomitant use of remimazolam with alcohol or/and CNS depressants should be avoided. 
Alcohol intake should be avoided for 24 hours before remimazolam administration. Such concomitant 
use has the potential to increase the clinical effects of remimazolam, possibly including severe 
sedation or clinically relevant respiratory depression. (see section 4.5) 
Chronic CNS depressant use 
Patients who receive chronic benzodiazepine therapy (e.g., for insomnia or anxiety disorders) may 
develop tolerance to the sedative effects of remimazolam. Hence, a larger cumulative dose of 
remimazolam may be required to achieve the desired level of sedation. It is recommended to follow 
the titration regimen in section 4.2 and titrate up based on the patient’s sedation-response, until the 
desired depth of sedation is achieved. (see section 4.5)

Monitoring 
Remimazolam should be administered only by health care professionals experienced in sedation who 
are not involved in conducting the procedure, in a setting fully equipped for the monitoring and 
support of respiratory and cardiovascular function. Administering personnel must be adequately 
trained in the recognition and management of expected adverse reactions including respiratory and 
cardiac resuscitation (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored closely during and after the 
procedure for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. The physician should also 
be aware of the typical time taken for patients to recover from the effects of remimazolam and 
concomitant opioid used in the clinical trials (see section 5.1), but that this may vary in individual 
patients. Patients should be closely monitored until they are judged by the healthcare professional to 
be sufficiently recovered. 
Amnesia 
Remimazolam can cause anterograde amnesia. Amnesia, if prolonged, can present problems in 
outpatients, who are scheduled for discharge following intervention. After receiving remimazolam, 
patients should be assessed and discharged from hospital or consulting room by their physician, only 
with appropriate advice and support. 
Hepatic impairment 
The clinical effects may be more pronounced and last longer in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment due to reduced clearance (see section 5.2). Special attention is required for the timing of 
titration doses (see section 4.2). These patients may be more susceptible to respiratory depression (see 
section 4.8). 
Myasthenia gravis 
Particular care should be taken when administering remimazolam to a patient with myasthenia gravis 
(see section 4.3). 
Drug abuse and physical dependence 
Remimazolam has an abuse and dependence-inducing potential. This should be considered when 
prescribing or administering remimazolam where there is concern about an increased risk of misuse or 
abuse. 
Excipients 
Dextran 
This medicinal product contains 79.13 mg of dextran 40 for injection in each vial. Dextrans can cause 
anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions in some patients.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Remimazolam is metabolised by CES, type 1A. No in vivo drug interaction study was conducted. 
In vitro data is summarised in section 5.2.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Increased sedation with CNS depressants and opioids 
The co-administration of remimazolam with opioids and CNS depressants, including alcohol, is likely 
to result in enhanced sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. Examples include opiate derivatives 
(used as analgesics, antitussives or substitutive treatments), antipsychotics, other benzodiazepines 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(used as anxiolytics or hypnotics), barbiturates, propofol, ketamine, etomidate; sedative 
antidepressants, non recent H1-antihistamines and centrally acting antihypertensive medicinal 
products. 
Concomitant use of remimazolam and opioids may result in profound sedation and respiratory 
depression. Patients should be monitored for respiratory depression and depth of sedation (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Alcohol intake should be avoided for 24 hours before remimazolam administration since it may 
markedly enhance the sedative effect of remimazolam (see section 4.4).  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
remimazolam in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Byfavo during 
pregnancy.  
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether remimazolam and its main metabolite (CNS7054) are excreted in human breast 
milk. Available toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of remimazolam and CNS7054 in 
milk (for details see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded; therefore, 
administration of remimazolam to breastfeeding mothers should be avoided. If there is a need to 
administer remimazolam, then discontinuation of breastfeeding for 24 hours after administration is 
advised. 
Fertility 
There are no human data on the effects of remimazolam on fertility. In animal studies there was no 
effect on mating or fertility with remimazolam treatment (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Remimazolam has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Prior to receiving 
remimazolam, the patient should be warned not to drive a vehicle or operate a machine until 
completely recovered. A physician should decide when the patient can be allowed to go home or 
resume normal activities, using the recovery data from the pivotal clinical trials as a basis for their 
decision (see section 5.1). It is recommended that the patient is given appropriate advice and support 
when returning home after discharge (see section 4.4).  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most frequent adverse reactions in patients with intravenous remimazolam are hypotension 
(37.2%), respiratory depression (13.1%), and bradycardia (6.8%). Safety precautions must be taken to 
manage the occurrence of these adverse reactions in clinical practice (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions associated with intravenous remimazolam observed in controlled clinical trials in 
procedural sedation and the postmarketing setting are tabulated below in Table 2 according to the

Elderly and/or patients with ASA-PS III-IV 
In controlled trials in procedural sedation, patients ≥65 years old had a higher frequency of events 
grouped under the terms hypotension (47.0% vs 33.3%) and respiratory depression (22.8% vs 9.0%)

than patients below 65 years old. Patients with ASA-PS III-IV also showed higher frequencies for 
hypotension (43.6% vs 35.6%) and respiratory depression (17.6% vs 11.8%) than patients with ASA-
PS I-II. Older age and higher ASA-PS were not associated with a higher frequency of bradycardia. See 
also sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Respiratory depression (hypoxia/oxygen saturation decreased) was reported in 2 of 8 subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment, and 1 of 3 with severe hepatic impairment enrolled in a dedicated trial 
assessing remimazolam in hepatic impairment. See also section 4.2. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of remimazolam overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological 
actions and may present with one or more of the following signs and symptoms: dizziness, confusion, 
drowsiness, blurred vision or nystagmus, agitation, weakness, hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory 
depression and coma. 
Management of overdose 
The patient's vital signs should be monitored and supportive measures should be started as indicated 
by the patient's clinical state including securing airway passages, assuring adequate ventilation and 
establishing adequate intravenous access. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment 
for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects.  
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial 
reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose 
with remimazolam is known or suspected.  
Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine 
overdose. Flumazenil will only reverse benzodiazepine-induced effects but will not reverse the effects 
of other concomitant medicinal products, e.g. that of opioids.  
Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other 
residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. However, since the 
elimination half-life of flumazenil is approximately the same as remimazolam the risk of re-sedation 
after flumazenil administration is low.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, hypnotics and sedatives, ATC code: N05CD14.  
Mechanism of action 
Remimazolam is an ultra-short acting benzodiazepine sedative. The effects of remimazolam on the 
CNS are dependent on the dose administered intravenously and presence or absence of other medicinal 
products. Remimazolam binds to benzodiazepine sites of gamma amino butyric acid type A [GABAA] 
receptors with high affinity, while its carboxylic acid metabolite (CNS7054) has approximately 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
300 times lower affinity for these receptors. Remimazolam does not show clear selectivity between 
subtypes of the GABAA receptor.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of remimazolam is sedation. 
Sedation is observed starting at single bolus doses of 0.05 to 0.075 mg/kg in healthy young adults, 
with an onset of 1 to 2 min following dosing. Induction of mild to moderate sedation is associated with 
plasma levels of around 0.2 µg/mL. Loss of consciousness is seen at doses of 0.1 mg/kg (elderly) or 
0.2 mg/kg (healthy young adults) and associated with plasma concentrations of around 0.65 µg/mL. 
Depth, duration and recovery from sedation is dose-dependent. Time to fully alert was 10 min for 
0.075 mg/kg of remimazolam.   
Remimazolam can cause anterograde amnesia after administration, which prevents patients from 
remembering events occurring during the procedure. Brice questionnaire data from 743 remimazolam-
treated patients, assessed 10 minutes after the patient became fully alert and one day after the 
procedure, show that 76% of patients had no recollection of the procedure.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of remimazolam was based on two pivotal studies CNS7056-006 and CNS7056-008 in 
adult patients (aged 18 to 95 years) with ASA-PS I-III who were scheduled for colonoscopy or 
bronchoscopy, respectively. The safety database for remimazolam additionally comprised a dedicated 
safety and efficacy trial in ASA-PS III/IV patients, CNS7056-015.  
CNS7056-006 and CNS7056-008 are two Phase 3 double-blind, randomised, active- and placebo-
controlled clinical trials in adult patients undergoing colonoscopy and bronchoscopy, respectively. All 
patients received fentanyl for analgesia before and during the procedure (50 or 75 µg or a reduced 
dose for elderly/debilitated patients and supplemental doses of 25 µg at least 5 min apart, as needed, 
but not to exceed 200 µg). Patients were randomised to remimazolam, midazolam dosed according to 
the U.S. local approved posology, or placebo with rescue midazolam dosed at the investigator’s 
discretion.  
The remimazolam and placebo groups were double-blinded, while the midazolam arm was open-label 
due to the different dosing regimen for midazolam. After pre-treatment with fentanyl to ensure 
analgesia, patients received an initial dose of 5.0 mg (2 mL) remimazolam or matching placebo over 
1 minute or 1.75 mg midazolam over 2 minutes (or 1.0 mg midazolam for patients ≥ 60 years of age or 
debilitated or chronically ill). For the remimazolam and placebo arms, supplemental doses of 2.5 mg 
(1 mL) at least 2 min apart were allowed until adequate sedation was achieved, and as necessary to 
maintain sedation. For midazolam, supplemental doses of 1.0 mg over 2 minutes with 2 minutes 
between doses (or 0.5 mg for patients aged ≥ 60 years or debilitated or chronically ill) were allowed to 
achieve and maintain adequate sedation. 
The number of top-up doses and total doses of remimazolam, rescue midazolam and fentanyl 
administered are presented in Table 4.

The primary endpoint, success of procedure was defined as meeting all of the following: 
•  Completion of the colonoscopy/bronchoscopy procedure, AND 
•  No requirement for a rescue sedative medication, AND  
•  No requirement of more than 5 doses of study medication within any 15 min window (for 
midazolam: no requirement of more than 3 doses within any 12 min window). 
Statistically significant higher success rates were observed for the difference between remimazolam 
and placebo (p< 0.0001; Table 5 and Table 6). Comparisons between remimazolam and midazolam 
are descriptive and significance testing was not performed. In the dedicated safety and efficacy trial in 
ASA-PS III/IV patients, CNS7056-015, similar results were observed, the procedure success rate was 
27/32 (84.4%) for remimazolam, and 0% for placebo.

The intent-to-treat analysis set includes all patients who were randomised. 
The onset and recovery profile of remimazolam was characterised by time-to-event secondary 
endpoints assessed in the two Phase 3 trials, CNS7056-006 and CNS7056-008. Time to start of 
procedure was shorter (p < 0.01) in remimazolam group compared to placebo (rescue midazolam) 
group (Table 7). Time to recovery is presented according to procedure duration (Tables 8 and 9).

Clinical Safety 
In procedures less than 30 minutes, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 80.9%, 
90.8%, and 82.3% in the remimazolam, midazolam, and placebo group, respectively. In procedures 
30 minutes or longer, the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 87.1% in the 
remimazolam group, and 100% in both the midazolam and the placebo groups.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Byfavo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the condition of sedation (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Remimazolam is administered intravenously.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Remimazolam has a mean distribution half-life (t1/2α) of 0.5 to 2 min. Its volume of distribution (Vz) is 
0.9 L/kg. Remimazolam and its main metabolite (CNS7054) show moderate (~90%) binding to plasma 
proteins, predominantly albumin.  
Biotransformation 
Remimazolam is an ester drug that is rapidly converted into the pharmacologically inactive carboxylic 
acid metabolite (CNS7054) by CES-1, mainly located in the liver.  
The main route of metabolism of remimazolam is via conversion to CNS7054, which is then to a small 
extent further metabolized by hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Conversion to CNS7054 is mediated 
by liver carboxylesterases (primarily type 1A), with no meaningful contribution by cytochrome P450 
enzymes.  
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that remimazolam or CNS7054 inhibit cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. There is no 
induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in man. In vitro studies showed 
no clinically relevant influence of CES inhibitors and substrates on the metabolism of remimazolam. 
Remimazolam was not a relevant substrate of a panel of human drug transporters (OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, BCRP, and MDR1 (=P-glycoprotein)). The same is true of CNS7054, tested for MRP2-4. 
By contrast, CNS7054 was found to be a substrate of MDR1 and BCRP. No or no relevant inhibition 
of the human drug transporters, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, 
BCRP, BSEP, or MDR1, was seen with remimazolam or CNS7054. 
Elimination 
Remimazolam has a mean elimination half-life (t1/2ß) of 7 to 11 minutes. Clearance is high (68±12 L/h) 
and not related to body weight. In healthy subjects at least 80% of the remimazolam dose is excreted 
in urine as CNS7054 within 24 hours. Only traces (< 0.1%) of unchanged remimazolam are detected 
in urine.  
Linearity 
Remimazolam dose versus remimazolam maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and total exposure 
(AUC0-∞) suggested a dose-proportional relationship in human volunteers in the dose range 0.01-
0.5 mg/kg. 
Special population 
Elderly 
There is no significant effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam given for procedural 
sedation (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of remimazolam were not altered in patients with mild to end stage renal 
disease not requiring dialysis (including patients with a GFR < 15 mL/min) (see section 4.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
Severe impairment of hepatic function resulted in a reduced clearance and, as a consequence, a 
prolonged recovery from sedation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following adverse reaction was not observed in clinical studies, but was seen in animals infused 
with the dosing solution of concentrations similar to the one used in clinical practice:  
Primary lesions due to a mechanical irritation of the vessel wall during the puncture procedure can be 
aggravated by concentrations of remimazolam above 1 to 2 mg/mL (infusion) or above 5 mg/mL 
during bolus administration. 
Reproduction and development  
Reproductive toxicity studies performed at the maximum tolerated dose level revealed no influence on 
male or female fertility and on reproductive function parameters. In embryotoxicity studies in rats and 
rabbits, even at the highest dose levels, which displayed maternal toxicity, only marginal embryotoxic 
effects were observed (reduced foetal weight and slightly increased incidences of early and total 
resorptions). Remimazolam and its main metabolite are excreted in breast milk of rats and rabbits. The 
inactive main metabolite CNS7054 was detected in the plasma of suckling rabbit kits, however it is 
not known if remimazolam is transferred via milk to suckling offspring.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Remimazolam 50 mg is indicated in adults for intravenous induction and maintenance of general 
anaesthesia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Remimazolam must only be given in hospitals or adequately equipped day therapy units by physicians 
trained in anaesthesia. 
Circulatory and respiratory functions should be constantly monitored (e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG), 
pulse oximetry) and facilities for maintenance of patent airways, artificial ventilation, and other 
resuscitation facilities should be immediately available at all times (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
The dose of Byfavo should be individualised based on the response of the patient and premedications 
used.  
Supplementary opioid analgesic agents are usually given in combination with Byfavo. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Induction of anaesthesia 
The rate of infusion of remimazolam should be set to 6 mg/min and measured against the response of 
the patient until clinical signs show the onset of anaesthesia and, in cases where needed, could be up-
titrated to a maximum of 12 mg/min.  
Most adult patients are likely to require 10-40 mg Byfavo. 
Maintenance of anaesthesia  
Anaesthesia is maintained by administering remimazolam by continuous infusion. 
Recommended starting dose for maintenance of anaesthesia is 1 mg/min remimazolam with a range of 
0.1-2.5 mg/min based on clinical judgement in order to maintain satisfactory anaesthesia.  
For maintenance of anaesthesia, during the ongoing infusion, additional boluses of 6 mg over one 
minute can be given according to clinical requirements. A maximum of three (3) boluses not less than 
5 min apart can be administered within 60 min. 
Towards the end of surgery (e.g. 15 min before the end) the dose of remimazolam may be titrated 
down to facilitate more rapid recovery from the anaesthetic effects. 
Special populations 
Elderly, American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) III-IV patients and patients 
with body weight < 50 kg 
Elderly patients and patients with ASA-PS III-IV may be more sensitive to the effects of anaesthetics. 
Before administration of remimazolam a careful assessment of the overall condition of patients 
≥ 65 years of age and/or with ASA-PS III-IV, especially with low body weight (< 50 kg), is therefore 
of particular relevance when deciding upon individualised dose adjustments for these patients (see 
section 4.4). The starting dose should be considered at the lower range.  
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in any grade of renal impairment (including patients with glomerular 
filtration rate [GFR] < 15 mL/min).  
Hepatic impairment 
The metabolising enzyme (carboxylesterase-1 [CES-1]) for remimazolam is predominantly located in 
the liver and the clearance of remimazolam is affected by increasing stages of hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh scores 5 and 6) 
or moderate (Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9) hepatic impairment. In patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh scores 10 to 15; data from only 3 subjects in clinical trials), the clinical effects may be 
more pronounced and last longer than in healthy subjects. No dose adjustments are required but 
careful attention should be paid to the timing of titration doses and remimazolam should be carefully 
titrated to effect in these patients (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of remimazolam in children and adolescents aged 0 to ˂18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Other populations 
The safety and efficacy of remimazolam in patients undergoing intracranial surgery and patients with 
pre-existing cognitive disorders have not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Remimazolam is for intravenous use. Remimazolam must be reconstituted and diluted before use with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection.  
19 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, and on 
administration with other fluids see section 6.6.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, other benzodiazpines or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Unstable myasthenia gravis. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cardiorespiratory adverse reactions 
Cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have been reported with the use of remimazolam, including 
respiratory depression, bradycardia and hypotension. Remimazolam administration can be associated 
with a transient increase in heart rate (10-20 beats per minute) starting as early as 30 seconds after the 
start of dosing. This increase in heart rate coincides with a decrease in blood pressure and it may 
confound QT correction for heart rate translating into a small prolongation in QTcF in the first few 
minutes following dosing. 
Special attention is required for elderly patients (≥65 years of age), for patients with impaired 
respiratory and/or cardiac function or for patients with poorer general health status (see section 4.2). 
Concomitant use of opioids 
Concomitant use of remimazolam and opioids may result in respiratory depression, coma and death. In 
patients with longer-term opioid use, caution is advised; it should not be presumed that these effects 
will be attenuated (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use of alcohol / Central Nervous System (CNS) depressants 
The concomitant use of remimazolam with alcohol or/and CNS depressants should be avoided. 
Alcohol intake should be avoided for 24 hours before remimazolam administration. Such concomitant 
use has the potential to increase the clinical effects of remimazolam, possibly including respiratory 
depression (see section 4.5). 
 Chronic CNS depressant use 
Patients who receive chronic benzodiazepine therapy (e.g., for insomnia or anxiety disorders) may 
develop tolerance to the sedative/hypnotic effects of remimazolam. Hence, a larger cumulative dose of 
remimazolam may be required to achieve the desired level of anaesthesia. A similar effect may also be 
observed with other CNS depressants. It is recommended to follow the titration regimen in section 4.2 
and titrate up based on the patient’s response, until the desired depth of anaesthesia is achieved (see 
section 4.5). 
Monitoring 
Remimazolam should be administered only by health care professionals trained in anaesthesia in a 
setting fully equipped for the monitoring and support of respiratory and cardiovascular function. 
Administering personnel must be adequately trained in the recognition and management of expected 
adverse reactions including respiratory and cardiac resuscitation (see section 4.2). The physician 
should also be aware of the typical time taken for patients to recover from the effects of remimazolam 
and concomitant opioid used in the clinical trials (see section 5.1), but that this may vary in individual 
patients. Patients should be closely monitored until they are judged by the healthcare professional to 
be sufficiently recovered. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amnesia 
Remimazolam can cause anterograde amnesia. Amnesia, if prolonged, can present problems in 
outpatients, who are scheduled for discharge following intervention. After receiving remimazolam, 
patients should be assessed and discharged from hospital or consulting room by their physician, only 
with appropriate advice and support. 
Hepatic impairment 
The clinical effects may be more pronounced and last longer in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment due to reduced clearance (see section 5.2). These patients may be more susceptible to 
respiratory depression (see section 4.8). 
Myasthenia gravis 
Particular care should be taken when administering remimazolam to a patient with myasthenia gravis 
(see section 4.3). 
Drug abuse and physical dependence 
Remimazolam has an abuse and dependence-inducing potential. This should be considered when 
prescribing or administering remimazolam where there is concern about an increased risk of misuse or 
abuse. 
Delirium  
Post-operative delirium and related neuropsychiatric events occur with reported incidence rate ranging 
from 4 to 53.3% in various published studies with sedatives or anaesthetic agents used for surgery or 
deep sedation in the intensive care. Risk factors include, but are not limited to, old age, pre-existent 
cognitive disorders, length and depth of anaesthesia or sedation, higher doses of longer acting 
benzodiazepines, metabolic disorders such as diabetes, electrolyte disorders, hypoxia, hypercapnia, 
hypotension, and infections. Although it is unclear whether remimazolam can itself cause or contribute 
to the risk of post-operative delirium, the lowest effective dose should be used. If post-operative 
delirium occurs, besides appropriate treatment of the delirium itself, any addressable risk factors 
should be appropriately treated. Patients should not be discharged prior to full recovery of cognition 
due to the potential risk of e.g. accidents. 
Paradoxical reactions  
Paradoxical reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements (including tonic/clonic convulsions 
and muscle tremor), hyperactivity, hostility, rage reaction, aggressiveness, paroxysmal excitement and 
assault, have been reported to occur with benzodiazepines. These reactions are more likely to occur in 
elderly patients, with high doses and/or when the injection is given rapidly. 
Prolonged effect of medicinal product 
Prolonged effect of remimazolam (sedation, time to orientation) was observed postoperatively in some 
patients after the end of remimazolam administration. This occurred more frequently in elderly 
(> 65 years old) patients, those with ASA III-IV and those receiving higher dose rates of remimazolam 
during the last hour of anaesthesia (see section 4.8.). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains 198 mg of dextran 40 for injection in each 50 mg vial. 
Dextrans can cause anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions in some patients.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions  
Remimazolam is metabolised by CES, type 1A. No in vivo drug interaction study was conducted. 
In vitro data is summarised in section 5.2.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions  
Increased sedation with CNS depressants and opioids  
The co-administration of remimazolam with opioids and CNS depressants, including alcohol, is likely 
to result in enhanced sedation and cardiorespiratory depression. Examples include opiate derivatives 
(used as analgesics, antitussives or substitutive treatments), antipsychotics, other benzodiazepines 
(used as anxiolytics or hypnotics), barbiturates, propofol, ketamine, etomidate, sedative 
antidepressants, non-recent H1-antihistamines and centrally acting antihypertensive medicinal 
products.  
Concomitant use of remimazolam and opioids may result in profound sedation and respiratory 
depression. Patients should be monitored for respiratory depression and depth of sedation/anaesthesia 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Alcohol intake should be avoided for 24 hours before remimazolam administration since it may 
markedly enhance the sedative effect of remimazolam (see section 4.4).  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of 
remimazolam in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Byfavo during 
pregnancy.  
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether remimazolam and its main metabolite (CNS7054) are excreted in human breast 
milk. Available toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of remimazolam and CNS7054 in 
milk (see section 5.3). A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded; therefore, administration of 
remimazolam to breastfeeding mothers should be avoided. If there is a need to administer 
remimazolam, then discontinuation of breastfeeding for 24 hours after stop of administration is 
advised.  
Fertility  
There are no human data on the effects of remimazolam on fertility. In animal studies there was no 
effect on mating or fertility with remimazolam treatment (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Remimazolam has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Prior to receiving 
remimazolam, the patient should be warned not to drive a vehicle or operate a machine until 
completely recovered. A physician should decide when the patient can be allowed to go home or 
resume normal activities. It is recommended that the patient is given appropriate advice and support 
when returning home after discharge (see section 4.4).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most frequent adverse reactions in patients with intravenous remimazolam for general anaesthesia 
are hypotension (51%), nausea (22.1%), vomiting (15.2%), and bradycardia (12.8%). Safety 
precautions must be taken to manage the occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia in clinical 
practice (see section 4.4).  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions associated with intravenous remimazolam observed in controlled clinical trials in 
general anaesthesia are tabulated below in Table  1 according to the MedDRA system organ 
classification and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order 
of decreasing seriousness. Frequency groupings are as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare 
(< 1/10 000); and not known (cannot be estimated from available data).

Cardio-respiratory events 
In controlled trials in general anaesthesia, patients ≥65 years old had a higher frequency of events 
grouped under the terms hypotension (64.2% vs 35.4%), respiratory depression (11.6% vs 5.8%) and 
bradycardia (19% vs 4.5%) than patients below 65 years old. Patients with ASA-PS III-IV also 
showed higher frequencies for hypotension (70.2% vs 32.6%), respiratory depression (15.7% vs 2.4%) 
and bradycardia (18.1% vs. 6.9%) than patients with ASA-PS I-II (see  sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Prolonged sedation 
In controlled trials in general anaesthesia, patients ≥65 years old had a higher frequency of events 
grouped under the term drug effect prolonged (11% vs 2.3%) than patients below 65 years old. 
Patients with ASA-PS III-IV also showed higher frequencies for drug effect prolonged (12.7% vs 
1.2%) than patients with ASA-PS I-II (see section 4.4).  
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Respiratory depression (hypoxia/oxygen saturation decreased) was reported in 2 of 8 subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment, and 1 of 3 with severe hepatic impairment enrolled in a dedicated 
clinical trial assessing remimazolam in hepatic impairment (see section 4.2).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V

4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
The symptoms of remimazolam overdose are expected to be an extension of its pharmacological 
actions and may present with one or more of the following signs: hypotension, bradycardia, and 
respiratory depression.  
Management of overdose 
The patient's vital signs should be monitored and supportive measures should be started as indicated 
by the patient's clinical state including securing airway passages, assuring adequate ventilation and 
establishing adequate intravenous access. In particular, patients may require symptomatic treatment 
for cardiorespiratory effects or central nervous system effects.  
Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist, is indicated for the complete or partial 
reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose 
with remimazolam is known or suspected.  
Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, proper management of benzodiazepine 
overdose. Flumazenil will only reverse benzodiazepine-induced effects but will not reverse the effects 
of other concomitant medicinal products, e.g. that of opioids.  
Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for re-sedation, respiratory depression, and other 
residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment. However, since the 
elimination half-life of flumazenil is approximately the same as remimazolam the risk of re-sedation 
after flumazenil administration is low. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Psycholeptics, hypnotics and sedatives, ATC code: N05CD14. 
Mechanism of action 
Remimazolam is an ultra-short acting benzodiazepine sedative/hypnotic. The effects of remimazolam 
on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered intravenously and presence or absence of other 
medicinal products. Remimazolam binds to benzodiazepine sites of gamma amino butyric acid type A 
[GABAA] receptors with high affinity, while its carboxylic acid metabolite (CNS7054) has 
approximately 300 times lower affinity for these receptors. Remimazolam does not show clear 
selectivity between subtypes of the GABAA receptor. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of remimazolam is sedation and hypnosis.  
Sedation is observed starting at single bolus doses of 0.05 to 0.075 mg/kg in healthy young adults, 
with an onset of 1 to 2 min following dosing. Induction of mild to moderate sedation is associated with 
plasma levels of around 0.2 μg/mL. Loss of consciousness is seen at doses of 0.1 mg/kg (elderly) or 
0.2 mg/kg (healthy young adults) and associated with plasma concentrations of around 0.65 μg/mL. 
During maintenance of anaesthesia plasma concentrations of remimazolam are normally in the range 
of 1 µg/mL when remifentanil was co-administered. Time to fully alert was 10 min for 0.075 mg/kg of 
remimazolam.  
Remimazolam can cause anterograde amnesia after administration, which prevents patients from 
remembering events occurring during the procedure. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of remimazolam was based on two pivotal studies CNS7056-022 and ONO-2745-05 in 
adult patients (aged 20 to 91 years) with ASA-PS I-IV who were undergoing mixed elective surgeries. 
The database for remimazolam additionally comprised additional propofol-controlled clinical trials in 
cardiac surgeries (CNS7056-010 and CNS7056-011).  
ONO-2745-05: This was a phase IIb/III multicenter, randomized, parallel-group trial of remimazolam 
compared with propofol in surgical patients rated as ASA class I or II undergoing general anaesthesia 
conducted in Japan. Remimazolam was administered at a dose of 6 (n=158) or 12 mg/kg/h (n=156) by 
continuous intravenous infusion until loss of consciousness. After loss of consciousness, continuous 
intravenous infusion at a dose of 1 mg/kg/h was started, after which the infusion rate was adjusted as 
appropriate (maximum allowed dose, 2 mg/kg/h) based on monitoring of the general condition of 
individual subjects until the end of the surgery. 
CNS7056-022: This was a European, confirmatory trial to establish non-inferior efficacy and superior 
haemodynamic stability of remimazolam compared with propofol for induction and maintenance of 
general anaesthesia during elective surgery in patients rated as ASA class III or IV. Patients were 
randomly assigned to the remimazolam (n=270) or the propofol arm (n=95). Remimazolam was 
administered at a dose of 6 mg/min for 3 min, followed by 2.5 mg/min for 7 min and 1.5 mg/min for 
an additional 10 min. Thereafter general anaesthesia was maintained with an infusion rate of 1 mg/min 
with adjustments between 0.7-2.5 mg/min based on monitoring of the general condition of individual 
subjects until the end of surgery. 
The primary endpoints in the pivotal clinical trials, were defined as : 
•  Percentage of general anaesthesia maintenance time with Narcotrend index (NCI) ≤60 
(CNS7056-022) 
•  Functional capability as a general anaesthetic as assessed by a composite of 3 variables: 
“intraoperative awakening or recall”, “requirement of rescue sedation with other sedatives” 
and “body movement.” (ONO-2745-05). 
The primary endpoint was reached in both clinical trials (see table 3). All doses of remimazolam were 
non-inferior to propofol.

In CNS7056-022, haemodynamic stability, assessed as absolute or relative hypotension and 
vasopressor use, was a key secondary endpoint. This was assessed during the period before start of 
surgery and is summarised in table 4. Remimazolam treated patients had fewer events of mean arterial 
pressure (MAP) of 1 min below 65 mmHg and fewer vasopressor dosing events.

The onset and recovery profile of remimazolam was characterised by time-to-event secondary 
endpoints assessed in the pivotal clinical trials. In each trial, time to recovery endpoints were slightly 
longer in the remimazolam groups than in the propofol group (table 5).

Clinical Safety 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in the propofol-controlled trials was 90.7% in the 
low induction dose remimazolam groups, 83.7% in the high induction dose remimazolam groups and 
92.5% in the propofol groups. Particularly the incidence of haemodynamic adverse events was lower 
for the remimazolam dose groups as compared to the propofol groups (table 6).

The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Byfavo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the condition of general anaesthesia (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Remimazolam is administered intravenously. 
Distribution 
Remimazolam has a mean distribution half-life (t1/2α) of 0.5 to 2 min. Its volume of distribution (Vd) is 
0.9 L/kg. Remimazolam and its main metabolite (CNS7054) show moderate (~90%) binding to plasma 
proteins, predominantly albumin.  
Biotransformation 
Remimazolam is an ester drug that is rapidly converted into a pharmacologically inactive carboxylic 
acid metabolite (CNS7054) by CES-1, mainly located in the liver.  
The main route of metabolism of remimazolam is via conversion to CNS7054, which is then to a small 
extent further metabolized by hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Conversion to CNS7054 is mediated 
by liver carboxylesterases (primarily type 1A), with no meaningful contribution by cytochrome P450 
enzymes.  
In vitro studies have shown no evidence that remimazolam or CNS7054 inhibit cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. There is no 
induction of the main inducible P450 isoenzymes 1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 in man. In vitro studies showed 
no clinically relevant influence of CES inhibitors and substrates on the metabolism of remimazolam. 
Remimazolam was not a relevant substrate of a panel of human drug transporters (OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, BCRP, and MDR1 (=P-glycoprotein)). The same is true of CNS7054, tested for MRP2-4. 
By contrast, CNS7054 was found to be a substrate of MDR1 and BCRP. No or no relevant inhibition 
of the human drug transporters, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2-K, 
BCRP, BSEP, or MDR1, was seen with remimazolam or CNS7054. 
Elimination 
Remimazolam has a mean elimination half-life (t1/2ß) of 7 to 11 minutes. The simulated context 
sensitive half-time after an infusion of 4 h is 6.6 ± 2.4 minutes. Clearance is high (68 ± 12 L/h) and not 
related to body weight. In healthy subjects at least 80% of the remimazolam dose is excreted in urine 
as CNS7054 within 24 hours. Only traces (<0.1%) of unchanged remimazolam are detected in urine.  
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Linearity 
Remimazolam dose versus remimazolam maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and total exposure 
(AUC0-∞) suggested a dose-proportional relationship in human volunteers in the dose range 
0.01-0.5 mg/kg. 
Special population 
Elderly 
There is no significant effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of remimazolam were not altered in patients with mild to end stage renal 
disease not requiring dialysis (including patients with a GFR < 15 mL/min) (see section 4.2).  
Hepatic impairment 
Severe impairment of hepatic function resulted in a reduced clearance and, as a consequence, a 
prolonged recovery from sedation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
The following adverse reaction was not observed in clinical studies, but was seen in animals infused 
with the dosing solution of concentrations similar to those used in clinical practice: primary lesions 
due to a mechanical irritation of the vessel wall during the puncture procedure can be aggravated by 
concentrations of remimazolam above 1 to 2 mg/mL (infusion) or above 5 mg/mL during bolus 
administration. 
Reproduction and development 
Reproductive toxicity studies performed at the maximum tolerated dose level revealed no influence on 
male or female fertility and on reproductive function parameters. In embryotoxicity studies in rats and 
rabbits, even at the highest dose levels, which displayed maternal toxicity, only marginal embryotoxic 
effects were observed (reduced foetal weight and slightly increased incidences of early and total 
resorptions). Remimazolam and its main metabolite are excreted in breast milk of rats,rabbits and 
sheeps. The inactive main metabolite CNS7054 was detected in the plasma of suckling rabbit kits. In 
suckling lambs, oral administration of remimazolam spiked milk resulted in negligable bioavalibility.

Incompatibilities 
Incompatibilities between Byfavo and co-administered solutions may result in precipitation/turbidity 
which may cause occlusion of vascular access site. Byfavo is incompatible with lactated Ringer’s 
solution (also known as compound sodium lactate solution or Hartmann’s solution), acetated Ringer’s 
solution, and bicarbonated Ringer’s solution for infusion and other alkaline solutions since the 
solubility of the product is low at pH of 4 or higher.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Byfavo is and what it is used for 
Byfavo is a medicine that contains the active substance remimazolam. 
Remimazolam is one of a group of substances known as benzodiazepines. 
Byfavo is a sedative given before a medical test or procedure to make you feel relaxed and sleepy 
(sedated). 
2. 
What you need to know before you are given Byfavo  
You must not be given Byfavo if: 
- 
you are allergic to remimazolam or other benzodiazepines (such as midazolam) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
you have an unstable form of a condition called myasthenia gravis (weakness of muscles) in 
which your chest muscles that help you breathe get weak 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Byfavo if you have any severe illness or condition and in 
particular if:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have very low or very high blood pressure or tend to faint 
you have heart problems especially a very slow and/or irregular (arrhythmic) heart rate 
you have any breathing problems including shortness of breath 
you have severe liver problems. 
you have a condition called myasthenia gravis in which your muscles are weak 
you regularly take recreational drugs or you have had problems with drug use in the past. 
Byfavo can cause temporary loss of memory. Your doctor will assess you before you leave the 
hospital or clinic and give you necessary advice. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Children and adolescents  
Byfavo should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because it has not been tested in 
children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Byfavo 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, in particular 
about: 
- 
opioids (including painkillers such as morphine, fentanyl and codeine or certain cough medicines 
or medicines for use in drug substitution therapy) 
antipsychotics (medicines to treat certain psychiatric illnesses) 
anxiolytics (tranquilizers or medicines that reduce anxiety) 
- 
- 
-  medicines that cause sedation (for example temazepam or diazepam) 
- 
- 
- 
antidepressants (medicines to treat depression) 
certain antihistamines (medicines to treat allergies) 
certain antihypertensives (medicines to treat high blood pressure) 
It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking other medicines, as using more than one at 
the same time can change the effect of the medicines involved. 
Byfavo with alcohol 
Alcohol can change the effect of Byfavo. Tell your doctor or nurse: 
- 
how much alcohol you drink regularly or if you have had problems with alcohol use; 
Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before you are given Byfavo. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
You should not use Byfavo if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Tell your doctor or 
nurse if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.  
If you are a breastfeeding mother, do not breastfeed for 24 hours after you are given this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Byfavo makes you sleepy, forgetful and affects your ability to concentrate. Even though these effects 
wear off rapidly, you must not drive and operate machinery until these effects are completely gone. 
Ask your doctor about when you can drive or operate machinery again. 
Byfavo contains dextran 40 for injection  
This medicine contains 79.13 mg of dextran 40 for injection in each vial. Rarely, dextrans can cause 
severe allergic reactions. If you have breathing difficulty or swelling or you feel faint, get medical help 
at once.  
3. 
How Byfavo is given 
Your doctor will decide on the right dose for you. 
Your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the procedure and the doctor 
will adjust the dose if needed. 
A doctor or nurse will give you Byfavo by injection into your vein (blood stream) before and during 
your medical test or procedure. Byfavo is mixed with sterile saline to make a solution before it is used. 
After the procedure 
Your doctor or nurse will check on you for a while after sedation to make sure that you feel well and 
are fit to go home.

Remimazolam must only be administered by health care professionals experienced in sedation. The 
patient should be monitored throughout by a separate healthcare professional, who is not involved in 
the conduct of the procedure, and whose sole task is to monitor the patient. All personnel must be 
trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction, hypoventilation and apnoea, including 
the maintenance of a patent airway, supportive ventilation and cardiovascular resuscitation. The 
patient´s respiratory and cardiac function must be continuously monitored. Resuscitative medicinal 
products and age- and size-appropriate equipment for restoring airway patency and bag/valve/mask 
ventilation must be immediately available. A benzodiazepine antagonist (flumazenil, a medicine for 
counteracting the effects of remimazolam) must be immediately available for use.  
Reconstitution instructions 
Note: Strict aseptic techniques must be mainted during handling, preparation and use of Byfavo. 
To reconstitute, use a sterile needle and a 10 mL sterile syringe, remove the vial cap, puncture the vial 
stopper at an angle of 90° and add 8.2 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, 
directing the stream of saline toward the wall of the vial. Gently swirl the vial until the contents are 
fully dissolved. The reconstituted solution should be clear and colourless to light yellow. The vial 
delivers a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL of remimazolam.  
The reconstituted solution must be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to 
administration. If particles or discolouration are present then the solution should be discarded.  
The reconsituted solution is for single use only, any unused portion must be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements.

5.  How to store Byfavo 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Byfavo is and what it is used for 
Byfavo is a medicine that contains the active substance remimazolam. This is one of a group of 
medicines known as benzodiazepines. Byfavo is given to make you lose consciousness (sleep) when 
you have surgery.  
2.  What you need to know before you are given Byfavo  
You must not be given Byfavo if: 
- 
you are allergic to remimazolam or other benzodiazepines (such as midazolam) or any of the 
other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
you have an unstable form of a condition called myasthenia gravis (weakness of muscles) in 
which your chest muscles that help you breathe get weak 
- 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Byfavo if you have any severe illness or condition and in 
particular if:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have very low or very high blood pressure or tend to faint 
you have heart problems especially a very slow and/or irregular (arrhythmic) heart rate 
you have any breathing problems including shortness of breath 
you have severe liver problems 
you have a condition called myasthenia gravis in which your muscles are weak 
you regularly take recreational drugs or you have had problems with drug use in the past. 
Byfavo can cause temporary loss of memory. Your doctor will assess you before you leave the 
hospital or clinic and give you necessary advice. 
Some patients undergoing surgical operations may experience sudden mental confusion (delirium) after 
the  operation.  This  is  more  common  in  patients  who  have  major  surgeries,  are  older,  have  memory 
problems, are exposed to anaesthesia/sedation which is deep and/or for a long period, or have infections. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with delirium may find it difficult to follow a conversation, be confused at some times more 
than others, become agitated and restless or sleepy and very slow, and have vivid dreams or hear noises 
or voices which do not exist. Your doctor will assess your condition and organise the necessary treatment 
to manage it. 
Benzodiazepines sometimes cause effects which are the opposite of the medication is meant to do. You 
may hear these referred to as 'paradoxical' effects. They include e.g. aggressive behaviour, agitation, 
anxiety. These are more common in older people when receiving high doses of the drug or when the 
drug is given rapidly. 
Children and adolescents 
Byfavo should not be given to patients under the age of 18 years because it has not been tested in 
children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Byfavo 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, in particular 
about: 
- 
opioids (including painkillers such as morphine, fentanyl and codeine or certain cough medicines 
or medicines for use in drug substitution therapy) 
antipsychotics (medicines to treat certain psychiatric illnesses) 
anxiolytics (tranquilizers or medicines that reduce anxiety) 
- 
- 
-  medicines that cause sedation (for example temazepam or diazepam) 
- 
- 
- 
antidepressants (medicines to treat depression) 
certain antihistamines (medicines to treat allergies) 
certain antihypertensives (medicines to treat high blood pressure) 
It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking other medicines, as using more than one at 
the same time can change the effect of the medicines involved. 
Byfavo with alcohol 
Alcohol can change the effect of Byfavo. Tell your doctor or nurse how much alcohol you drink 
regularly or if you have had problems with alcohol use. 
Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours before you are given Byfavo. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
You should not use Byfavo if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Tell your doctor or 
nurse if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.  
If you are a breastfeeding mother, do not breastfeed for 24 hours after you are given this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Byfavo makes you sleepy, forgetful and affects your ability to concentrate. Even though these effects 
wear off rapidly, you must not drive and operate machinery until these effects are completely gone. 
Ask your doctor about when you can drive or operate machinery again. 
Byfavo contains dextran 40 for injection 
This medicine contains 198 mg of dextran 40 for injection in each vial. Rarely, dextrans can cause 
severe allergic reactions. If you have breathing difficulty or swelling or you feel faint, get medical help 
at once.  
3. 
How Byfavo is given 
Your doctor will decide on the right dose for you. 
Your breathing, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored during the procedure and the doctor 
will adjust the dose if needed. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A doctor or nurse will give you Byfavo by injection into your vein (blood stream) before and during 
surgery. Byfavo is mixed with sterile sodium chloride solution to make a solution before it is used. 
You may need several medicines to keep you asleep, free from pain, breathing well with a steady 
blood pressure. The doctor will decide which medicines you need. 
Time to recovery after end of administration is expected to be 12-15 min.  
If you are given too much Byfavo 
If you are given too much Byfavo, you may have the following symptoms: 
- 
- 
- 
your blood pressure may drop 
your heartbeat may slow down 
your breathing may become slow and shallow 
Your doctor will know how to treat you. 
Ask your doctor or nurse if you have any questions about the use of this medicine.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Byfavo 50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for injection/infusion  
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
Must be reconstituted and further diluted before use with Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection 
Read the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) carefully before use.  
Remimazolam must only be given in hospitals or adequately equipped day therapy units by physicians 
trained in anaesthesia. 
Circulatory and respiratory functions should be constantly monitored (e.g. ECG, pulse oximetry) and 
facilities for maintenance of patent airways, artificial ventilation, and other resuscitation facilities 
should be immediately available at all times. 
Instructions for use 
General precautions 
Each vial is for single use only. Reconstitution and dilution of the product should be conducted using 
aseptic techniques. Once opened the contents of the vial should be used immediately (SmPC 
section 6.3). To prevent coring, the needle should be inserted at a 45–60° angle with the opening of the 
needle tip facing up (i.e., away from the stopper), sometimes referred to as “bevel up”. A small 
amount of pressure is applied, and the angle is gradually increased as the needle enters the vial. The 
needle should be at a 90° angle just as the needle bevel passes through the stopper. 
Instructions for reconstitution 
Byfavo should be reconstituted by adding 10 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection and swirled gently until the powder has entirely dissolved. Reconstituted Byfavo will be 
clear and colourless to light yellow. The solution is to be discarded if visible particulate matter or 
discolouration is observed.  
Instructions for dilution 
For administration, the reconstituted solution must be further diluted. The appropriate volume of 
reconstituted remimazolam solution must be withdrawn from the vial(s) and added to a syringe or 
infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection in order to achieve a 
final concentration of 1-2 mg/ml remimazolam (Table 2). 
Table 2 Dilution instructions 
Reconstituted solution 
5 mg/mL 
(50 mg reconstituted with 10 mL) 
Final concentration 2 mg/ml 
Dilute 10 mL of reconstituted 
solution with 15 mL of sodium 
chloride (0.9%) solution for 
injection 
Final concentration 1 mg/ml 
Dilute 10 mL of reconstituted 
solution with 40 mL of sodium 
chloride (0.9%) solution for 
injection 
Administration with other fluids 
When Byfavo is reconstituted and diluted for use in sodium chloride (0.9%) as described above, 
compatibility has been shown with: 
Glucose 5% intravenous infusion,  
Glucose 20% w/v solution for infusion,  
Sodium Chloride 0.45% w/v and Glucose 5% w/v solution for infusion,  
Sodium Chloride 0.9% intravenous infusion,  
Ringers Solution (Sodium Chloride 8.6 g/L, Potassium Chloride 0.3 g/L, Calcium Chloride dihydrate 
0.33 g/L) 
This medicinal product must not be mixed or co-administered through the same infusion line with 
medicinal products other than those fluids described in this section 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Incompatibilities  
Incompatibilities between Byfavo and co-administered solutions may result in precipitation/turbidity 
which may cause occlusion of vascular access site. Byfavo is incompatible with Lactated Ringer’s 
Solution (also known as Compound Sodium Lactate Solution or Hartmann’s Solution), Acetated 
Ringer’s Solution, and Bicarbonated Ringer’s Solution for infusion and other alkaline solutions since 
the solubility of the product is low at pH of 4 or higher. 
This medicinal product must not be mixed or co-administered through the same infusion line with 
other medicinal products except those mentioned in “Administration with other fluids”. 
In-use stability after reconstitution 
Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 20°C to 25°C.  
From a microbiological point of view , unless the method of opening/reconstitution/dilution precludes 
the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
Special precautions for storage 
Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light.

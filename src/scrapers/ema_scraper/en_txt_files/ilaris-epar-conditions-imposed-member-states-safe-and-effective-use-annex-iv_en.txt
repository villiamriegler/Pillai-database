OF MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES 
The Member States should ensure that all conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product described below are implemented: 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) shall ensure that, prior to launch, all physicians who are 
expected to prescribe/use Ilaris are provided with a physician information pack containing the 
following:

patients treated with Ilaris;

•  The need to instruct patients on proper techniques for self-administration when the patient is 
willing and capable to do so, and guidance for Health Care Professionals on how to report 
administration errors; 
•  The identified or potential risk of immunogenicity that might lead to immune-mediated 
symptoms; 
•  The need for Health Care Professionals to perform an annual clinical assessment of patients 
regarding a potential increased risk for the development of malignancies; 
•  The need to measure neutrophil counts prior to initiating treatment, after 1 to 2 months and 
periodically thereafter while receiving Ilaris as treatment with Ilaris should not be initiated in 
patients with neutropenia; 
•  The need to monitor patients for changes in their lipid profiles; 
•  The unknown safety of Ilaris in pregnant and lactating women, thus the need for physicians to 
discuss this risk with patients if they become or plan to become pregnant; 
•  The proper patient management as regards the interaction with vaccination; 
•  The possibility to include patients in the registry study to facilitate the collection of long term 
efficacy and safety data;

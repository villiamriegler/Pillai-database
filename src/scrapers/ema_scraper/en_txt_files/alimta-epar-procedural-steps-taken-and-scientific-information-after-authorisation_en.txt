type II  variation, upon request by CHMP  following the 
and PL 
assessment of the 3rd PSUR,  to update sections 4.4 and

failure.  
Serious renal events, including acute renal failure, have 
been reported with pemetrexed alone or in association with 
other chemotherapeutic agents. Many of the patients in 
whom these occurred had underlying risk factors for the 
development of renal events including dehydration or pre-
existing hypertension or diabetes. 
Further, the MAH has made an editorial change in section 
4.2 and a minor amendment to the warning regarding 
yellow fever vaccine in section 4.4 for increased clarity. 
Immunodepressed status is common in cancer patients. As 
a result, concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines 
(except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not 
recommended.

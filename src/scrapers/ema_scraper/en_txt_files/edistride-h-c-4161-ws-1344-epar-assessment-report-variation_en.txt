2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Dapagliflozin is a selective, and orally active inhibitor of the human renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 
2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin (5 mg/10 
mg) is currently approved in over 90 countries to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin has been approved in the European Union (EU) since 
November 2012 (FORXIGA procedure number: EMEA/H/C/002322, EDISTRIDE procedure number: 
EMEA/H/C/004161) and in the United States (US) since January 2014. 
The MAH now seeks marketing approval for the use of dapagliflozin in adult patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and the following indication was proposed (at time of submission of the 
application): 
Forxiga / Edistride is indicated for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in adult patients as an 
adjunct to insulin, when insulin does not provide adequate glycaemic control.  
The proposed dosing of dapagliflozin in patients with T1DM, as initially proposed, was 10 mg once 
daily. 
Background to T1DM 
T1DM is a serious disorder of chronic hyperglycaemia that results from the autoimmune destruction of 
insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. T1DM accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of all cases of 
diabetes worldwide (Daneman 2006). Approximately four fifths of patients with T1DM are diagnosed as 
children (Beck et al 2012). T1DM is therefore a disease that most patients live with for the greater part 
of their lives. 
While the life expectancy of patients with T1DM has improved considerably over the past century, it 
remains significantly reduced compared with the nondiabetic population. The loss of life expectancy in 
patients with T1DM after attaining 20 years of age has recently been estimated to be more than 10 
years compared with the general population, mainly due to the increased risk of ischaemic heart 
disease (Livingstone et al 2015). Glycaemic control is key to reducing morbidity and mortality (Distiller 
2014).  
However, HbA1c alone does not provide the complete picture; even in patients with good glycaemic 
control, T1DM is still associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with the general 
population (Lind et al 2014). Mitigating other risk factors for micro- and macrovascular complications 
apart from glycaemic control (e.g., blood pressure, body weight, and lipids) is thus also of importance 
for the long-term outcomes in this patient population. New diabetes treatments for T1DM that also 
target some of these risk factors would be of advantage. Further, despite identical mean HbA1c, 
patients can have large differences in their glycaemic variability (ie, intraday glycaemic oscillations or 
excursions) (Kilpatrick et al 2007). There is evidence that glycaemic variability in itself can contribute 
to the pathogenesis of vascular complications in diabetes (Hirsch 2015). Added to this, the quality of 
daily life of T1DM patients is highly dependent on their glucose swings (Vanstone et al 2015). 
Current treatment options 
Patients with T1DM require lifelong insulin therapy due to their inability to produce enough endogenous 
insulin. However, a large proportion of the T1DM population is unable to achieve recommended 
glycaemic levels with insulin alone (ADA 2017, Soedamah-Muthu et al 2008). There are currently no 
Assessment report

Page 8/116 
 
 
 
 
approved adjunct treatments to insulin for patients with T1DM in the EU and only 1 in the US 
(pramlintide), whose use is limited. 
While insulin treatment is lifesaving in patients with T1DM, many patients suffer from hypoglycaemic 
events as a result of the treatment, which negatively impact their daily lives and can, conversely, be 
life-threatening.  
The glycaemic variability associated with insulin treatment also negatively impacts patients’ quality of 
life (Vanstone et al 2015). Reducing swings in glucose levels is therefore of importance to prevent 
insulin-induced hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia as well as to improve the quality of life in patients with 
T1DM. 
Another risk associated with suboptimal insulin use is DKA. Clinical and registry studies have shown 
annual rates of DKA of approximately 5% to 7% in patients with T1DM (Weinstock et al 2013, Maahs 
et al 2015). In particular, T1DM patients treated with short-acting insulin via pump are at risk for DKA 
if their pumps fail as they do not have any reservoir of basal insulin (Phillip et al 2007). However, a 
meta-analysis has shown that in the context of proper education and good practice, the frequency of 
DKA is similar in patients injecting insulin and patients using insulin pumps (Weissberg-Benchell et al 
2003). 
Rationale for the proposed change 
In patients with T2DM, dapagliflozin improves glycaemic control and promotes weight loss. In patients 
with T1DM, SGLT2 inhibition by dapagliflozin was expected to produce similar glucose-lowering effects, 
as well as modest reductions in body weight, blood pressure, and, potentially, glycaemic variability, as 
the amount of glucose excreted following dapagliflozin treatment is dependent on the plasma glucose 
concentration and independent of insulin (Defronzo et al 2013).  
Success criteria for the development of dapagliflozin to treat T1DM 
For a new add-on to insulin treatment for T1DM to add value for patients, it is the MAH’s position that 
the treatment should produce a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c without increasing the risk of 
hypoglycaemia and with a manageable safety profile with respect to DKA compared with insulin 
treatment alone. The benefit-risk evaluation for dapagliflozin is thus primarily focused on HbA1c 
reduction, incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events and DKA in patients with T1DM. It is the MAH’s 
view that additional treatment effects, such as attenuating weight gain and reducing glycaemic 
variability, would further increase the value of a new add-on to insulin treatment. 
Development program 
The key studies demonstrating efficacy and safety in global populations are studies MB102229 and 
MB102230, which included subjects in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. The studies included 24-week 
short-term (ST) double-blind treatment periods, on which the efficacy analyses were primarily based. 
The studies also include 28-week long-term (LT) extension periods; the LT extension of MB102229 is 
completed, while the LT extension of MB102230 is ongoing. 
Studies D1695C00001 and MB102072 provide PK/PD data for subjects with T1DM as well as additional 
safety data. Integrated analyses and comparisons with PK/PD data from studies in subjects with T2DM 
were also used for the characterisation of the PK/PD of dapagliflozin in subjects with T1DM. 
Compliance with regulatory guidance 
Treatment and regulatory authority guidance considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 9/116 
 
 
 
 
The following guidelines were considered in the design and conduct of studies MB102229 and 
MB102230: 
•  Standards of medical care in diabetes 2014 (ADA 2014) 
•  Notes for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus (CPMP 2002, CHMP 2012) 
•  Diabetes mellitus: developing drugs and therapeutic biologics for treatment and prevention – 
draft guidance for industry (FDA 2008) 
The designs of studies MB102229 and MB102230 are in accordance with the recommendations of these 
guidelines regarding, eg, statistical methodology, choice of efficacy endpoints, safety assessments, and 
choice of comparator. 
Scientific advice 
Key advice from the EMA on programme design was as follows: 
• 
The conduct of 2 similar confirmatory studies, lead-in period and treatment period duration, 
choice of dapagliflozin doses, choice of comparator, and inclusion criterion of HbA1c ≥8.0% 
were endorsed. 
•  A drop in HbA1c of no more than 0.5% between enrolment and randomisation was initially 
recommended. 
• 
• 
The use of PK and PD data from T2DM patients can be used to support an indication in T1DM, 
and the different EC50 values observed between T1DM and T2DM patients should be discussed. 
Insulin treatment during the studies should be optimised to achieve best possible glycaemic 
control. 
•  Hypoglycaemia as the most important secondary endpoint was encouraged, and a combined 
response variable for glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia secondary variable was 
recommended (eg, a predefined decrease in Hb1Ac and without relevant hypoglycaemic 
event). 
In accordance with the scientific advice, subjects whose HbA1c changed ≥0.5% between enrolment 
and randomisation were initially excluded from study MB102229. However, because this criterion 
accounted for approximately 80% of subjects being ineligible for randomisation after completing the 
lead-in period, the MAH sought renewed advice from the EMA and removed the criterion after 
agreement that doing so was appropriate. 
Paediatric investigational plan 
A waiver has been granted which applies to the paediatric population from birth to less than 2 years on 
the grounds that the medicinal product is likely to be unsafe in this population. 
Thus the subset of the paediatric population concerned by the paediatric development in T1DM is 
children from 2 years to less than 18 years of age. The development plan includes the development of 
an age appropriate dosage form, two clinical studies in children from 10 to 18 years and children from 
2 to 18 years as well as a modelling and simulation study for dose selection in children from 2 to 18 
years.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A re-evaluation of the Environmental Risk Assessment was conducted and submitted in the type II 
variation assessed in the current report. No new tests were performed. In the initial application, a 
refined market penetration factor (Fpen) was used to calculate the predicted environmental 
concentration (PEC). In the re-evaluated ERA the default value of Fpen was used (0.01) resulting in 
higher PEC values and PEC/PNEC ratios. The updated PEC/PNEC ratios for microorganisms, ground 
water, surface water, and sediment are, as in the initial application, below the trigger values.

In the initial assessment of the environmental risk of dapagliflozin, it was concluded from the results of 
the aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems that dapagliflozin is persistent 
in sediments. In the submitted ERA however, dapagliflozin was considered not persistent. Since no 
new data was submitted, the initial assessment remains applicable, i.e. dapagliflozin is considered 
persistent. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new indication leads to a significant 
increase in environmental exposure further to the use of dapagliflozin.  
Considering the above data, dapagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The complete pharmacokinetic profile of dapagliflozin was presented in the original dapagliflozin 
submission for T2DM (FORXIGA procedure number: EMEA/H/C/002322, EDISTRIDE procedure 
number: EMEA/H/C/004161), which summarised the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) characteristics of tofacitinib from relevant in vitro and in vivo studies. 
The following is a summary of the PK characteristics of dapagliflozin: 
•  After oral administration, systemic exposure of dapagliflozin increases in a dose proportional 
manner. 
• 
The mean plasma terminal half-life for dapagliflozin is 12.9 hours following a single oral dose of 
dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. The mean total systemic clearance of dapagliflozin 
administered intravenously is 207 ml/min. 
•  Dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed and has an absolute bioavailability (BA) of 78% after oral 
administration. 
•  Approximately 91% of circulating dapagliflozin is bound to plasma proteins. 
•  Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, mainly mediated by UGT1A9, to inactive metabolites. 
Special populations 
Population Pharmacokinetics in Patients with T1DM 
The PK of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients is based upon pooled population PK analysis of plasma 
concentrations from 1 phase IIa study (MB102072), and 2 phase III studies (MB102229 and 
MB102230). The objectives of this analysis were: (a) to describe pharmacokinetic properties of 
dapagliflozin in T1DM patients including individual covariate effects on the PK parameters, (b) to 
calculate individual dapagliflozin AUC estimates for exposure-response analyses, (c) and to 
descriptively compare dapagliflozin PK properties between T1DM and T2DM patients.

In study MB102072 patients were treated with placebo or dapagliflozin (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg) once daily 
for 14 days. PK samples were taken pre-dose and up to 24 h post-dose on day 7. In studies MB102229 
and MB102230 patients with inadequate glycemic control (defined as HbA1c≥7.5%) were treated for 
24 weeks with 5 mg or 10 mg dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to insulin. Dapagliflozin concentrations 
at Day 1 up to Week 24 were used for the analysis. In total, 5797 samples with quantifiable 
concentrations from 1151 subjects were used for the analysis. Data exclusions; 122 (1.9%) 
concentrations were below the lower limit of quantification, 10 (0.16%) samples had missing sampling 
time, 170 samples (2.7%) had wrong/missing dosing time, and 270 (4.3%) concentrations were 
judged as post- rather than pre-dose concentrations. The PK sampling characteristics for the three 
studies have been summarised in Table 2.

Hanover, Maryland, USA). Model fitting was performed in a Linux environment (CentOS 5, equivalent 
to Redhat Enterprise Linux 5) with GFortran FORTRAN Compiler, version 4.7.3 (Gnu Compiler 
Collection, GCC). Xpose4, version 4.5.3 (xpose.sourceforge.net), PsN, version 4.4.8 
(psn.sourceforge.net) and R, version 3.2.4 (R-project, www.r-project.org) were used for the 
exploratory analysis, executing NONMEM runs and post-processing of NONMEM output, for example to 
assess goodness-of-fit. The estimation routine was FOCE with interaction. 
The modelling steps are summarised in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Overview of Population PK analysis of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients. 
Base model 
The previously developed dapagliflozin structural model was a linear 2-compartment model with first 
order absorption and lag time. This model was used as the basis for model development. The model 
was initially estimated using only data from the phase 2 study (MB102072), before the phase 3 data 
was added (MB102229 and MB102230). The sampling schedule did not allow for estimation of the 
absorption rate constant which was fixed to the previous parameter estimate. No further disposition 
models were evaluated. The random effect model was based on the T1DM patient data.  
Stepwise covariate model development 
Graphical covariate screening was performed to evaluate the potential influence of pre-specified 
covariates on selected PK parameters (Table 3). For continuous covariates, scatter plots of random 
effects against covariates overlaid with a non-parametric smoother and/or regression line were used to 
help identify potentially important relationships. For categorical covariates, box and whisker plots of 
individual (post-hoc) pharmacokinetic parameters for each of the groups were used to identify 
differences between groups. 
Pre-specified covariates listed in Table 3 were selected based on physiological plausibility and prior 
knowledge. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was derived using the Modification of Diet in 
Renal Disease (MDRD, Levey et al. 2007) formula. The proposed list of covariates was intended to be 
included in covariate testing if the available data support the planned evaluation. 
Table 3 List of covariates investigated for their potential impact on the 
pharmacokinetic parameters 
Covariates were identified using a stepwise covariate modelling (SCM) procedure. Stepwise testing of 
linear and power relationships was performed in a forward inclusion (ΔOFV of 6.63, p <0.01 for 1

degrees of freedom) and backward exclusion (ΔOFV of 10.8, p <0.001 for 1 degrees of freedom) 
procedure. In case of categorical covariates, ΔOFV at the respective p - values may be different 
depending on the degrees of freedom. Retaining the covariate relationships identified by SCM was 
based on the reliability of the parameter estimate describing the covariate relationship (%RSE < 40). 
The impact of all pre-specified covariates not identified in the SCM procedure was investigated using 
the full covariate approach. Only covariates with a correlation coefficient ≤|0.4| were added to the 
model. The effect on CL/F (i.e. AUC) was of interest for the current analysis. The precision in the 
covariate effects or relationship was based on the variance-covariance matrix generated by NONMEM. 
The influence, or lack of influence, of the covariates on primary PK parameters was illustrated 
graphically in forest plots. 
Final model 
The PK of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients was described by a 2-compartment model with first order 
absorption and linear clearance. The model was parameterised in terms of first-order absorption rate 
constant, apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (Vc/F), apparent peripheral 
volume of distribution, and apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F). Exponential inter-individual 
variability (IIV) was estimated for CL/F, Vc/F, and Q/F. The residuals were described by a proportional 
error model. The final parameter estimates and the associated relative standard errors are presented 
in Table 4.

The identified covariate relationships in T1DM patients were similar to the covariate relationships 
previously reported (adult T2DM patients and healthy subjects); estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR)/creatinine clearance on CL/F (increased CL/F with higher renal function), and sex on CL/F 
(higher CL/F in males), and body weight on Vc/F (higher Vc/F with higher body weight). In addition, 
body weight was identified as a covariate on CL/F (higher CL/F with higher body weight), and sex 
(higher Vc/F for males) and age (lower Vc/F with higher age) on Vc/F. Within the studied range of 
covariates, no covariates affected systemic dapagliflozin exposure more than 25% compared to the 
reference individual (Caucasian male with body weight of 78.7 kg and eGFR of 88.6 mL/min/1.72 m2)

Comparison of dapagliflozin exposure in T1DM and T2DM patients 
Model-predicted AUC for T1DM and T2DM (from previous analysis, original submission for T2DM) for 5 
mg and 10 mg were extracted and compared descriptively. Apparent clearance in T1DM subjects (20.5 
L/h) was similar to previous estimate in patients with T2DM and healthy subjects (22.9 L/h) which 
translates into similar AUC between patient populations. Boxplots for dapagliflozin AUC stratified by 
population and dose are displayed in Figure 6. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area 
under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), and time to reach maximum concentration (tmax) 
for the 2 populations are summarized in Table 5.

Overall, the pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients was adequately described by the 
population PK model. The identified covariates in T1DM patients were similar to the covariates found in 
T2DM patients and healthy subjects, of which none are considered clinically relevant. Dapagliflozin 
systemic exposure after administration of 5 mg and 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily was dose-
proportional and was comparable in adult T1DM and T2DM patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Dapagliflozin is a selective, and orally active inhibitor of the human renal sodium-glucose cotransporter 
type 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin lowers 
plasma glucose in an insulin-independent manner by inhibiting the renal reabsorption of glucose and 
promoting its urinary excretion. 
Dapagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters important for glucose transport into peripheral 
tissues and is > 1,400 times more selective for SGLT2 versus SGLT1, the major transporter in the gut 
responsible for glucose absorption. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Study MB102072 
Study MB102072 was a randomised, double-blind, 5-arm, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 
exploratory Phase IIa trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of dapagliflozin in subjects 
with T1DM who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.0%) despite insulin use. 
Subjects received dapagliflozin 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mg, or matching placebo on a background of adjustable 
insulin for a total of 14 days and were monitored closely with regard to safety parameters, including 
vital signs, safety laboratory tests (including urinary ketones), and adverse events. 
The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of each dose of dapagliflozin. Secondary 
objectives were to assess the change from baseline in mean glucose based on 7-point central 
laboratory glucose monitoring achieved with each dapagliflozin dose versus placebo after 7 days of in-
patient treatment, and to assess the PK of dapagliflozin and its major inactive metabolite, dapagliflozin 
3-O-glucuronide, on Day 7. 
In total, 70 subjects were randomised and treated, and 62 completed the study as planned. Mean age 
was 35.3 years, 57.1% of subjects were male, 88.6% of subjects were white, mean body mass index 
(BMI) was 24.88 kg/m2, and mean HbA1c was 8.46%. 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Seven-point glucose monitoring: The 7-point glucose monitoring measured plasma glucose before and 
2 hours after each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and at bedtime. Mean 7-point glucose trended lower 
in all treatment groups compared to baseline, including the placebo group. The placebo group had a 
numerically higher mean value at baseline than the dapagliflozin groups. The placebo and dapagliflozin 
1 mg groups tended to have progressive reductions in mean 7-point glucose values over the 7-day in-
patient period. However, in the dapagliflozin 2.5, 5, and 10 mg groups, the greatest impact on mean 
7-point glucose was seen at Day 1 and this effect was reduced by Day 7. There were no differences in 
change from baseline to Day 7 of mean of 7-point glucose measurement in any dapagliflozin treatment 
groups versus placebo.

Twenty-four hour (24h) UGE and inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption (IRR): The 24h UGE and 
percent IRR were based on 24h urine collections on Days -1, 1 and 7. UGE was higher and more 
variable in the placebo group at baseline, consistent with other measures suggesting a potential 
imbalance in overall glycaemic control at baseline in this group. The dapagliflozin groups showed a 
dose-dependent increase in urine glucose and a markedly higher percentage of IRR than the placebo 
group at Day 7. The placebo group had a change from baseline in 24h UGE at Day 7 of -21.45 g. The 
dapagliflozin 1 and 2.5 mg groups had changes of 41.48 and 48.09 g, respectively. Larger increases 
were seen in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups of 71.71 and 88.02 g, respectively. The highest 
IRR values were reported in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups. 
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG): Fasting plasma glucose trended downward for all groups following 
administration of study drug, including the placebo group. Administration of dapagliflozin seemed to 
result in a numerically greater reduction in FPG at Day 1 than at Day 7. 
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): Average daily glucose from all CGM values for a 24h period was 
assessed as a measure of overall glucose control. There was a trend towards improvement in the 
placebo group, with a change from baseline in average daily glucose derived from CGM at Day 7 of -
20.25 mg/dL. Greater reductions were seen in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, with a change 
from baseline in average daily glucose at Day 7 of -29.55 and -41.27 mg/dL, respectively. Two 
different measures of glycaemic variability (standard deviation and mean amplitude of glycaemic 
excursions) were also assessed from CGM. Both showed little improvement in the placebo group, with 
more clear improvements of glycaemic variability in the dapagliflozin-treated subjects, particularly at 
the 5 mg and 10 mg doses. 
Total daily insulin dose: Dapagliflozin treatment was associated with a 11.13% to 19.31% reduction in 
total daily insulin dose from baseline to Day 7: a change of -19.31% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group 
and -16.17% in the 10 mg group. In the placebo group the mean percent change from baseline to Day 
7 was +1.66%. 
Study D1695C00001 (Part A) 
Study D1695C00001 (Part A) was a Phase I study to evaluate the PK and PD of dapagliflozin in 
combination with insulin in Japanese subjects with T1DM who had inadequate glycaemic control. The 
study was a randomised, single-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study. Subjects were 
randomised 1:1:1 to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, or placebo once daily for 7 days. 
In total 62 subjects were enrolled and 42 were randomised. All subjects were recruited in Japan and 
were Asian. On average subjects were 38.9 years old, 161.8 cm in height, and 59.55 kg in weight with 
an average BMI of 22.72 kg/m2. Approximately 24% of the subjects were obese according to Japanese 
criteria (BMI ≥25 kg/m2). Overall, 57.1% of the subjects were female: the placebo group was 78.6% 
female, the 10 mg group was 50.0% female, and the 5 mg group was 42.9% female. For all 
randomised subjects, the mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.98% with no substantial differences among 
the treatment groups. Mean baseline FPG was slightly higher in the 5 mg group than in the 10 mg 
group and the placebo group. 
Subjects self-monitored their blood glucose at least 7 times per day (generally before and after 
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime) during the treatment period and contacted investigators in the 
event of an unusually high or low value.

Pharmacodynamic results 
UGE: Similar increases of UGE from baseline to Day 7 were seen for the dapagliflozin 5 mg group 
(96.55 g/24h) and the 10 mg group (101.28 g/24h). During the same time interval a small decrease 
was seen in the placebo group with a mean change of -6.16 g/24h.  
Daily insulin dose: At Day 7 the mean change from baseline in total insulin dose was -36.86%, -
39.13%, and -4.97% in the 5 mg, 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. After Day 7 (during 
follow-up), a quick return to baseline was observed in both dapagliflozin groups. By Day 10, in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, the mean total insulin dose had returned to baseline. 
FPG: Mean FPG was reduced in both dapagliflozin treatment groups at Day 7 compared to baseline 
while increases over baseline occurred for the placebo group at Day 7. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Effect of dapagliflozin on UGE in subjects with T1DM compared to subjects with T2DM 
Objectives 
A model-based analysis was performed to characterise the relationship of dapagliflozin exposure and 
UGE in subjects with T1DM and compare it to data from subjects with T2DM. 
Data and methods 
The models were created using data from 1 study in T1DM subjects (MB102072) and data from 3 
studies in T2DM subjects (MB102003, MB102007, and MB102025). Non-linear mixed effects models 
were developed to characterise the relationship between dapagliflozin exposure and UGE, and to 
evaluate the effects of baseline covariates on the UGE response. The base model also included subject 
type as a covariate on both Emax and half maximal effective concentration (EC50). To evaluate the 
effects of baseline FPG, UGE, and eGFR, these covariates were evaluated in the final model on both 
Emax and EC50. Table 6 provides the average UGE levels (g/24h) reported in studies MB102072, 
MB102003, MB102007, and MB102025 across dose levels.

Table 6 Urinary glucose excretion in subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes 
The analysis of UGE response was performed using steady-state average plasma concentration (Cavg) 
of dapagliflozin and longitudinal 24-hour UGE (Day 0 to Day 14) versus time data from T1DM subjects 
and T2DM subjects. Data from 160 subjects were available for this analysis: 70 with T1DM (study 
MB102072) and 90 with T2DM (studies MB102003 [N=46], MB102007 [N=8], and MB102025 [N=36]). 
Eight subjects were excluded from the analysis because of missing steady-state AUC measurements, 
resulting in a total of 152 subjects available for characterising the relationship between Cavg and 
change in UGE vs. time. The baseline covariates assessed in the analysis were UGE, FPG, and eGFR 
(Table 7).

The MCMC Bayesian algorithm in NONMEM version 7.2 was used for model development. To evaluate 
convergence of three independent MCMC chains, Gelman and Rubin diagnostics were examined, and 
the plots of the three MCMC chains vs. iteration were visually inspected.  
The structural model was defined as: 
where UGE0 is the estimated UGE at Day = 0, Emax is the maximum UGE at steady state, Cavg is the 
observed dapagliflozin average concentration at steady state, EC50 is the Cavg at which half of Emax is 
achieved, Kdrg is the rate constant for reaching the steady-state UGE response, and Day is the time in 
days. Separate population parameters were estimated for each patient type (T1DM or T2DM). Baseline 
covariates were evaluated on Emax and EC50. An additive inter-individual (IIV) variability model was 
used for Emax and an exponential IIV model was tested for baseline UGE, Kdrg and EC50. 
Results 
The Emax model described the relationship between steady-state dapagliflozin exposure and 24h UGE 
reasonably well although some apparent outliers are present in the T2DM population. The exposure-
response relationship and model performance is visualised in Figure 7. 
Figure 7 Prediction-corrected visual predictive check. 
Prior to adding covariates, the potency of dapagliflozin appeared to be greater in T1DM (EC50 = 2.72 
ng/mL) than in T2DM (EC50 = 12.24 ng/mL). Following normalisation for individual baseline values of 
FPG, eGFR and UGE, the potency of dapagliflozin was very similar in the 2 populations (T1DM EC50 = 
8.12 ng/mL; T2DM EC50 = 7.75 ng/mL) (Figure 8), as well as the maximum effect (T1DM Emax = 
71.1 g/24h; T2DM Emax = 76.8 g/24h). Whereas the rate constant to reach steady-state UGE 
response differs between the 2 populations (T1DM Kdrg = 2.98 1/day; T2DM Kdrg = 14.9 1/day) 
(Figure 9).

before and after normalisation for baseline covariates 
Figure 9 Observed and Final Model-Predicted Population Mean Urinary Glucose 
Excretion vs. Time by Dose of Dapagliflozin 
Prediction of UGE response after long term treatment with dapagliflozin suggests that the 5 and 10 mg 
doses would be predicted to have median UGE responses of 80 g/24h (90% CI: 61-96 g/24h) and 86 
g/24h (90% CI: 71 - 102 g/24h), respectively. 
Overall, taking the individual baseline values UGE, FPG, and eGFR into account, the underlying 
exposure-response relationship is similar for subjects with T1DM and T2DM.

Objectives 
The Japanese Exposure-Response Report developed a model characterising the relationship between 
dapagliflozin AUC and UGE in Japanese and non-Japanese T1DM subjects and evaluated the effect of 
covariates on this relationship. 
Data and methods 
The model was developed using pooled Day 7 UGE data from 2 clinical studies: 1 study in Japanese 
T1DM subjects (D1695C00001 [Part A]) and 1 study in non-Japanese T1DM subjects (study 
MB102072). The final exposure-response model was designed according to data-driven decisions 
guided by statistical and heuristic rules. A nonlinear mixed effect modelling approach (NONMEM 7.3.0 
software) was used to estimate the exposure-response parameters, their variances, and the effects of 
covariates. Investigated covariates included; baseline covariates age, body weight BM1, eGFR, FPG, 
HbA1c, total insulin and SMBG, as well as day 7 measurements of basal insulin, bolus insulin, total 
insulin, change from baseline SMBG, day 7 FPG and day 7 SMBG. The final model considered 
covariates that impact 24h UGE response: baseline eGFR, mean SMBG at Day 7, and change (%) from 
baseline in total insulin dose. 
Results 
The Emax model successfully described the relationship between steady-state dapagliflozin exposure 
and 24h UGE at Day 7. The exposure-response relationship and model performance is visualised in 
Figure 10. 
Figure 10 Visual predictive check plot, 24 hour UGE 
Exposure of dapagliflozin for matching doses was similar between study D1695C00001 and MB102072 
(Figure 11). For dose-response measured by 24h UGE, the data showed a difference between the 
studies. In study MB102072 the average 24h UGE in the 5 mg group was 83.6 g/24h and in the 10 mg 
group was 90.9 g/24h. In study D1695C00001 (Part A), the difference in average 24h UGE between 
the 5 mg and 10 mg arms was smaller (115.9 g/24h vs 118.1 g/24h). Figure 12 presents the 
exposure-response data from both studies.

The modelling results indicate the apparent differences in dose-response between Japanese and non-
Japanese subjects (Figure 13) are caused primarily by the differences in daily glycaemic control: 
insulin dose reductions and average SMBG levels.

Figure 13 Population dose-response (experimental values and model predictions) 
at Day 7 in Japanese and non-Japanese T1DM subjects 
The lack of difference in UGE between the 5 mg and 10 mg groups in the Japanese population may be 
explained by higher SMBG levels, likely resulting from greater insulin reductions at Day 7 in study 
D1695C00001. Compared with study MB102072 (average reductions: 19.31% and 16.17%), the 
degree of insulin dose reduction for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups was much higher in study 
D1695C00001 (averaging 36.86% and 39.13%, respectively). 
The results from this report and the prior UGE analysis (see section on “Effect of dapagliflozin on UGE 
in subjects with T1DM compared to subjects with T2DM”) are consistent in terms of predicting the 
effect of 5 mg and 10 mg doses of dapagliflozin from study MB102072. The UGE effect predicted by 
the model presented here (77 g/24h and 85 g/24h for 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively, see 
Figure 13) is similar to the effect predicted in the previous UGE analysis (80 g/24h and 86 g/24h for 5 
mg and 10 mg doses, respectively, see also Figure 8). 
Effect of dapagliflozin on HbA1c in subjects with T1DM 
Objectives 
In the Dose-Response and Exposure-Response (HbA1c) Report, pharmacometric analyses were 
performed to (1) graphically assess the effect of dapagliflozin on HbA1c in subjects with T1DM, (2) 
describe the relationships between dapagliflozin dose/exposure and HbA1c change over time and at 24 
weeks, and (3) to explore the impact of covariates on those relationships. 
Data and methods 
These analyses included (a) graphical exploration and (b) modelling using pooled individual 
longitudinal HbA1c data from the short-term treatment periods of 2 Phase III studies in T1DM subjects 
(MB102229 and MB102230). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 30/116 
 
 
 
 
 
In both Phase III studies, HbA1c was measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter during the 
24-week ST treatment period. The longitudinal HbA1c data were used in the analyses. Individual AUCs 
were estimated for each subject from the PopPK model fitted to pooled data from studies MB102072, 
MB102229, and MB102230. A mixed-effect model repeated measure with dose-response and 
exposure-response components described with an E max function was used to describe the longitudinal 
data in T1DM. 
The following covariates were assessed during the modelling: baseline HbA1c, eGFR, reduction in total 
insulin dose (reduction at Week 24 relative to baseline insulin dose), age, baseline glucose levels from 
CGM, gender, race (Asian or non-Asian), and method of insulin administration (multiple daily injections 
or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]). 
The covariates were selected base on previous exposure-response models developed for dapagliflozin 
in subjects with T2DM as well as exposure-response models developed for UGE in T1DM patients. 
Differences between the T1DM and T2DM clinical study designs precluded a robust comparison of the 
effect of dapagliflozin on HbA1c in the T1DM versus T2DM studies. 
These differences included dissimilar lead-in periods (2 weeks in T2DM Phase II and III versus 8 weeks 
in T1DM Phase III) and varying rules on insulin dose adjustment (continuous adjustments in T1DM 
studies but not in T2DM studies). Therefore, the Dose-Response and Exposure-Response (HbA1c) 
Report does not explore a T1DM versus T2DM comparison for HbA1c response. 
The software package NONMEM, version 7.3.0 was used in this analysis. PsN, version 4.2.0 and R, 
version 3.0 were used for the exploratory analysis and post-processing of NONMEM output, for 
example to assess goodness-of-fit. 
Results 
The dose-response and exposure-response models fit data from subjects with T1DM well (Figure 14 
and Figure 15, respectively). The mean placebo-corrected HbA1c reductions at Week 24 predicted by 
the dose-response model for 5 mg and 10 mg doses were -0.38% (95% CI: -0.46%, -0.30%) and -
0.43% (95% CI: -0.51%, -0.35%), respectively. For exposure-response model predicted HbA1c 
reductions at Week 24 (placebo-corrected change from baseline) in T1DM patients were: -0.40% (95% 
CI -0.50, -0.31) and -0.43% (95% CI -0.53, -0.34) for 5 mg and 10 mg doses, respectively. The dose-
response model and exposure response model predictions aligned well with the mean observed effects 
in MB102229 (-0.42% and -0.45% in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively and in MB102230 (-
0.37% and -0.42%, respectively) (Figure 16).

The final covariate analysis demonstrated that method of insulin administration had an impact on 
HbA1c reductions (patients using CSII had approximately 20% larger HbA1c reductions), however it 
was not deemed to be clinically relevant. None of the other covariates assessed during the modelling 
could be estimated with precision to have a significant impact on HbA1c response.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Adequate model development and evaluation approaches have been used in the population PK 
analysis. Data under the limit of detection has been excluded from the analysis which is considered 
acceptable due to the low extent of such data. The visual predictive checks indicate that there is some 
model misspecification the absorption phase and description of maximum concentration, however this 
behaviour is considered acceptable since clearance (CL/F) is well described and it is the overall 
exposure (AUC or Caverage) that is more closely related to the effect. Furthermore, there is low 
shrinkage in the distribution of the individual Bayes estimates of CL/F which warrants for adequate 
prediction of individual AUC values.  The provided VPCs were somewhat difficult to interpret due to low 
visibility in the early PK time-profile (see Figure 4) and the MAH is kindly asked to provide VPCs with 
greater detail in future applications. 
Overall, the PK of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients is sufficiently described and displays no major 
deviation from the PK described in T2DM patients. However, the predicted distribution of exposure 
(AUC) is wider in the T1DM patient group, i.e. higher exposures are predicted (Figure 6). This result is 
likely due to demographic differences in the patient populations, where it is expected that the T1DM 
patients have a lower body weight which would lead to higher exposure.

Pharmacodynamics 
No new data on the mechanism of action for dapagliflozin has been provided. This is acceptable since 
the mechanism of action has been adequately described in the original file supporting the MAA in the 
treatment of T2DM and these data may be extrapolated to the T1DM population. 
In order to characterise the pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in patients with T1DM, data from two 
placebo-controlled studies (MB102072 and D1695C00001, Phase A) have been presented. The two 
studies were of comparable design. Study MB102072 tested four dapagliflozin doses (1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 
mg and 10 mg) in patients with T1DM. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of 
each dose but effects on glucose, UGE and total insulin dose were also assessed. PK data was also 
collected. Study D1695C00001, Phase A, was designed to investigate the PK of dapagliflozin in 
Japanese subjects with T1DM. Effects on FPG, UGE and total insulin dose were also assessed. In 
contrast to study MB102072, only two dapagliflozin doses were studied (5mg and 10 mg). In both 
studies the insulin doses were to be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator in order to avoid 
hyper- or hypoglycaemias. Thus there was no titration guidance in place.  
In study MB102072, the insulin dose was essentially unchanged in the placebo-treated group at Day 7 
whereas a decrease in insulin doses ranging from -11% to -19% was observed in the dapagliflozin 
treated groups. There was no evident dose dependent change in insulin dose. In study D1695C00001, 
a mean change of -39.13% in total insulin dose was seen in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group and of -
36.86% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group. The mean change in the placebo group was -4.97%. Thus the 
reduction in total insulin dose was about twice that observed in study MB102072. Since the reduction 
of insulin dose was made at the discretion of the investigator, this may have affected the outcome, 
especially in study D1695C00001 which was single-blinded. The changes in insulin doses may affect 
the outcome of the endpoints such as FPG and CGM and to some extent also UGE. 
A dose-dependent increase in urinary glucose excretion (UGE) was observed in both studies. An 
increased UGE was observed also at the lowest dose of 1 mg. The UGE was numerically higher in study 
D1695C00001, which only included Japanese subjects, than in study MB102072 (see modelling data). 
Study MB102072 also investigated the inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption (IRR) which also showed 
a dose dependent increase. 
Both studies investigated the effect of treatment on FPG. In study MB102072, there was a greater 
decrease in FPG in the dapagliflozin treated groups at Day 1 compared to placebo, but this pattern was 
less evident at Day 7. There was no apparent dose dependent decrease. In study D1695C00001, FPG 
was reduced in both dapagliflozin-treated groups with no apparent dose dependency, whereas FPG had 
increased in the placebo-treated group. This was observed in spite of the rather large reduction in 
insulin doses in the dapagliflozin-treated groups. 
Study MB102072 also investigated the effect of dapagliflozin on the 7-point glucose curve. Although 
there was a trend towards a greater reduction of the 7-point glucose curve Day 1 at the higher doses 
of dapagliflozin, no differences were observed at Day 7. The CGM data showed a trend towards less 
variability in the glucose measurements with dapagliflozin treatment compared to placebo.  
The data provided support that dapagliflozin exerts a dose dependent effect on UGE in T1DM, further 
analysis of the data show that this effect is comparable to the effect observed in patients with T2DM. 
The data also indicate that, in patients with T1DM, dapagliflozin may lower blood glucose variability.  
The effect on FPG is difficult to assess since insulin titration was not performed in a standardised 
manner, but a decrease in FPG was observed with dapagliflozin across all doses compared to placebo.

PK/PD modelling 
Effect of dapagliflozin on UGE in subjects with T1DM compared to subjects with T2DM 
In general, the model development procedure is acceptable and the goodness-of-fit diagnostic indicate 
a reasonable model fit although some outliers are present in the T2DM population. 
The estimated rate constant to reach steady-state UGE response (Kdrg) differs between the two 
patient populations. However, the calculations show that 95% of steady-state UGE is reached within 
the first day for both patient populations. 
Effect of dapagliflozin on UGE in Japanese subjects with T1DM and non-Japanese subjects with T1DM 
The model development procedure is acceptable. According to the goodness-of-fit diagnostics and 
visual predictive checks the model describes the data fairly well. Although the model results indicate 
reasonable description of data the presented model of the Japanese/non-Japanese patients display 
substantial differences in the covariate relationship compared to the T1DM/T2DM model. The 
differences are mainly due to differences in the covariate model building procedure and model 
parametrisation, and the differences are not deemed clinically relevant. Furthermore, in the model to 
compare T1DM and T2DM patients, observed Cavg was used as the exposure metric, whereas in the 
exposure-response model for Japanese patients AUC have been used as a driver of the effect. Although 
the two exposure metrics are essentially the same, the unit of the EC50 parameter will differ and for 
comparative reasons it is encouraged to standardise the exposure metric in future analyses exposure-
UGE analyses. The MAH is encouraged to harmonise the exposure-UGE models for future applications. 
Effect of dapagliflozin on HbA1c in subjects with T1DM 
Standard model development and evaluation approaches have been used in the analysis of the 
dose/exposure-HbA1c relationships. Predicted AUC (see section on Pharmacokinetics) has been used 
as the exposure metric in the analysis which is acceptable. The HbA1c models describe the data well 
and the results are adequate to support dose selection. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin in subjects with T1DM has been sufficiently well described. The 
results display no major deviation from the pharmacokinetics in subjects with T2DM, and therefore the 
PK findings from the T2DM development programme can therefore be applied to the T1DM population. 
However, a wider distribution of exposure is seen in the T1DM patients, likely due to differences in 
demographics between the two patient populations. 
The pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin in subjects with T1DM has been adequately described. The 
data show that an effect on UGE is observed across the doses investigated although a limited 
difference is detected in between the therapeutic doses 5 mg and 10 mg. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study was performed. In both Phase III studies, the study treatments 
were either dapagliflozin 5 mg once daily, dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, or placebo, all as add-on to 
insulin therapy. The 5 mg and 10 mg once daily dapagliflozin doses were chosen based on data from a 
Phase II T1DM study (MB102072) that showed the exposure response relationship in terms of urinary 
Assessment report

glucose excretion is very similar in subjects with T1DM and T2DM. Dapagliflozin 5 mg has been 
established as the minimally effective dose in T2DM patients and dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg are 
each approved in multiple countries worldwide for the treatment of T2DM. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
Two key Phase III efficacy studies were included in the dapagliflozin T1DM development programme: 
studies MB102229 and MB102230.  
Methods 
Studies MB102229 and MB102230 had similar designs. Both studies were multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase III studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
dapagliflozin when added to ongoing insulin therapy in subjects with T1DM. The studies included an 8-
week lead-in period, a 24-week short-term (ST) treatment period, and a 28-week long-term (LT) 
extension (LT extension was still ongoing for study MB102230 at the time of submission but the data 
was submitted during the procedure). The primary and secondary efficacy analyses are based on the 
24-week results, with selected analyses repeated for the 52-week results as exploratory analyses of LT 
efficacy. The safety analyses are based on the 24-week and 52-week results. The design of the 2 
studies is illustrated in Figure 17. 
Figure 17 Design of studies MB102229 and MB102230 
During the 8-week lead-in period the diabetes management was optimised based on individual subject 
challenge to glycaemic control (including hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, and erratic meal/exercise 
patterns) and the variability in blood glucose profiles and frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes at 
baseline was assessed.

Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) 
At the entry into the lead-in period, subjects received a glucose and ketone meter. Subjects were to 
self-monitor their blood glucose at least 4 times per day (generally before breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 
bedtime), and in the occurrence of hypoglycaemic symptoms, and to contact the Investigator in the 
event of an unusually high or low blood glucose value. In addition, study subjects should comply with 
site’s instructions with regard to self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin adjustments accordingly 
and should report to the site blood glucose values and/or signs and symptoms suggestive of a 
hypoglycaemia episode.  
Self-Monitored Blood Ketone Testing and Guidance on Management and Reporting of Diabetic 
Ketoacidosis Episodes 
Subjects were advised to measure their blood ketones when they had potential symptoms/signs of 
DKA, and/or during acute illness. Blood ketone test results, symptoms potentially associated with DKA 
and relevant risk factors (e.g. missed insulin injection, insulin pump malfunction, infection, heart 
attack, etc.) should be recorded in the subject diary. 
Study participants 
In both studies, the target population was subjects with T1DM aged ≥18 to ≤75 years who were on 
ongoing insulin treatment for at least 12 months and who had inadequate glycaemic control, with 
central laboratory HbA1c at the Week -1 visit of ≥7.5% to ≤10.5%. 
Subjects were excluded from the study if they had been admitted to a hospital because of hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia or had experienced diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring medical intervention within 
1 month of the screening visit. Subjects were also excluded from the study if they had significant 
concurrent disease such as cardiovascular events within the prior 6 months, malignancy within the 
past 5 years (with the exception of treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma), or renal/hepatic 
insufficiency.  
Treatments 
In both studies, the study treatments were either dapagliflozin 5 mg once daily, dapagliflozin 10 mg 
once daily, or placebo, all as add-on to insulin therapy. 
Ongoing insulin therapy 
After the first dose of study drug, it was recommended that Investigators reduce daily insulin dose by 
up to 20% to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia. The timing and degree of any reduction was at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Insulin reductions of >20% from baseline at any time during the study 
were not recommended. Following any initial reduction in insulin dose, attempts were to be made to 
titrate insulin back to the baseline level. 
Subjects were are not allowed to change their insulin administration methods (MDI or CSII) during the 
study unless a subject using an insulin pump needed to replace the pump, in which case the subject 
could temporarily use MDI but should restart CSII administration as early as feasible.

Objectives 
The primary objective in both study MB102229 and MB102230 was to: 
•  Compare dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg plus adjustable insulin versus placebo plus adjustable 
insulin for the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of double-blinded treatment. 
The secondary objectives in both study MB102229 and MB102230 were to: 
1.  Compare the percent change from baseline in total daily insulin dose with dapagliflozin 5 mg or 
10 mg plus adjustable insulin versus placebo plus adjustable insulin after 24 weeks of double-
blinded treatment. 
2.  Compare the percent change from baseline in body weight with dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg 
plus adjustable insulin versus placebo plus adjustable insulin after 24 weeks of double-blinded 
treatment. 
3.  Compare the change from baseline in the mean value of 24-hour glucose readings obtained 
from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg plus adjustable 
insulin versus placebo plus adjustable insulin after 24 weeks of double-blinded treatment. 
4.  Compare the change from baseline in mean amplitude of glucose excursion (MAGE) of 24-hour 
glucose readings obtained from CGM with dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg plus adjustable insulin 
versus placebo plus adjustable insulin after 24 weeks of double-blinded treatment. 
5.  Compare the change from baseline in the percent of 24-hour glucose readings obtained from 
CGM that falls within the target range of >70 mg/dL and ≤180 mg/dL with dapagliflozin 5 mg 
or 10 mg plus adjustable insulin versus placebo plus adjustable insulin after 24 weeks of 
double-blinded treatment. 
6.  Compare dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg plus adjustable insulin versus placebo plus adjustable 
insulin for the proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c reduction from baseline to Week 24 
visit ≥0.5% without severe hypoglycaemia events. 
The studies also included several exploratory efficacy objectives, including an objective to assess the 
maintenance of effect of dapagliflozin after up to 52 weeks of treatment. All efficacy analyses at/up to 
Week 52 were exploratory.

Sample size 
To detect a difference in means of 0.35% in HbA1c at Week 24 between each dapagliflozin treatment 
group and placebo at the 2-sided 0.0262 significance level (based on Dunnett and Tamhane step-up 
procedure), and assuming a standard deviation of 1.1%, 243 subjects were needed in each treatment 
group in studies MB102229 and MB102230 to provide an approximately 90% power. Assuming that 
5% of subjects would not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of 768 subjects (256 subjects per 
treatment group) were planned to be randomised in each study in a 1:1:1 ratio to each treatment 
group.  
In study MB102229 an extra 55 patients were randomised to replace patients excluded due to a 
randomisation error. 
Randomisation 
At the screening visit each subject was assigned a unique sequential subject number by the Interactive 
Voice/Web Response System (IXRS). Following completion of the lead-in period, eligible subjects were 
randomised on Day 1 to one of the 3 double-blind treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio using a centralised 
blocked randomisation schedule. 
Randomisation was stratified by the following factors to ensure equal representation across all 
treatment groups: 
•  Current use of CGM (yes or no) (ie, an unblinded/personal device being used by the subject 
prior to enrolment, in addition to the CGM device being introduced as part of the study) 
•  Method of insulin administration at baseline (multiple daily injections [MDI] defined as 3 or 
more injections per day versus continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) 
•  Week -1 Visit (baseline) HbA1c ≥7.5% and <9.0% versus ≥9.0% and ≤10.5% 
In study MB102229, an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) randomisation system error 
affected the first 55 randomised subjects. These subjects were excluded from the full analysis set prior 
to database lock and therefore excluded from all efficacy analyses; the subjects were, however, 
included in the safety analysis set and the safety analyses. The randomisation target was increased by 
55 to maintain the power for the primary endpoint. Thus, the total number of subjects planned to be 
randomised in study MB102229 was 823. 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinded dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo was administered orally, once daily for the 24-week 
double-blinded short-term treatment period. The investigator, the MAH’s personnel, and subjects 
remained blinded to treatment allocation throughout the short-term, double-blind treatment period. 
During the 28-week long-term treatment period, subjects and sites remained blinded.

Statistical methods 
Study MB102229 and MB102230 are multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group studies. 
Analysis populations 
Two analysis sets were specified for efficacy, the full analysis set and the per-protocol analysis set. The 
efficacy analyses were based primarily on the full analysis set.  The per-protocol analysis set was to be 
used to analyse the primary endpoint only if more than 10% of the full analysis set subjects in any 
treatment group had relevant protocol deviations.  Safety analyses were based on the safety analysis 
set. 
The full analysis set consists of all randomised subjects who took at least one dose of double-blind 
study drug during the short-term double-blind period.  Subjects in the full analysis set are presented in 
the treatment group to which they were randomised at the start of the short-term treatment period 
(even if the treatment they received was different). In study MB102229 the first 55 randomized 
subjects were excluded from the full analysis dataset due to a randomisation error. 
The per-protocol analysis set is a subset of the full analysis set consisting of subjects who did not have 
relevant protocol deviations that had the potential to impact the results of the primary efficacy 
analysis.  All decisions to exclude subjects from the full analysis set were made prior to database lock.   
The safety analysis set consists of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug.  Any subjects receiving incorrect study drug for the entire course of their participation were 
summarised according to the treatment that they actually received. 
Multiplicity 
Treatment effects were determined through pair-wise treatment group comparisons: each dapagliflozin 
treatment group versus placebo. To maintain an overall Type I error rate of 5% for the endpoint, a 
Dunnett and Tamhane step-up procedure was used, which allowed for the correlation of 0.5 between 
the standard normal deviate for each comparison. Statistical significance was declared for both doses 
at the 2-sided 5% level if the 2-sided p-values from both pairwise comparisons were smaller than 5%. 
If the larger p-value among the 2 pairwise comparisons was greater than 5% and the smaller p-value 
was below 2.62%, then statistical significance would be declared for the latter comparison.  
The primary and secondary efficacy variables were analysed and statistically tested in a stepwise 
fashion in the order listed under “Outcomes/endpoints” above. For comparison of each dapagliflozin 
group versus placebo separately, if the primary endpoint was significant, the statistical tests for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints were performed. The type I error rate for comparing each dapagliflozin 
group to placebo group for each secondary efficacy endpoint was be controlled at the 0.0262 level 
(two-sided). Secondary efficacy endpoints were to be tested in the order that they appear in the 
objectives section of the protocol and protocol synopsis. Statistical tests between each dapagliflozin 
group and placebo group was to be performed only performed for a given secondary endpoint if all 
previous sequential tests for that comparison were significant. Otherwise, the testing procedure would 
stop at the secondary endpoint that did not reach statistical significance. This sequential testing 
procedure was to be implemented independently for each dapagliflozin treatment group as it is 
compared to placebo. 
P-values were calculated for all comparisons for the secondary endpoints. However, no claim is based 
on endpoints for which the statistical testing was not performed for the endpoint as per the testing 
strategy as described above. No claims are made based on these p-values.

Analysis methods 
The primary analysis of the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was based on a longitudinal 
repeated measures analysis using ‘direct likelihood’.  The SAS procedure PROC MIXED was used.  An 
unstructured matrix for the within-subject error variance-covariance was used.  The denominator 
degrees of freedom was calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method.   
Adjustment for covariates 
The model for the primary analysis included the fixed categorical effects of treatment, week, 
randomisation stratification factor (ie, one term for each combination of all stratification factors) and 
treatment-by-week interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement 
and baseline measurement-by-week interaction.  
Subgroup analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint of HbA1c was summarised for predefined subgroups and stratification 
factors: race, gender, ethnicity, baseline A1C, subject age, geographic region, method of insulin 
administration, use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and baseline Body Mass Index.  The 
subgroup by treatment interaction was assessed for the primary efficacy endpoint using a longitudinal 
repeated measures analysis model with subgroup, subgroup-by-time, and subgroup-by-time-by- 
treatment group interaction as 3 additional effects. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy variable were conducted to assess the robustness of the 
primary analysis. The sensitivity analyses included an estimation of the de facto (intention-to-treat) 
estimand for the primary efficacy variable, which had been requested by the US Food and Drug 
Administration, and which was included as a post-hoc analysis for study MB102229 and a pre-specified 
analysis for study MB102230. 
Missing data 
A sensitivity analyses using ANCOVA with LOCF was performed for the primary efficacy analysis. The 
longitudinal repeated measures model is based on a missing at random (MAR) assumption with respect 
to missing data. The proportion of missing data by visit was summarized and reasons (i.e. missing visit 
only, discontinued treatment, or discontinuation from study, including by reason for treatment or study 
discontinuation) was assessed to verify the validity of this assumption. If a substantial amount of 
missing data was observed or if imbalances occurred amongst the treatment groups, sensitivity 
analyses based on a missing not at random assumption (MNAR) assumption was to be conducted, as 
appropriate and feasible based on the observed data. Various methods such as multiple imputation, 
placebo-based imputation, or tipping point analysis were to be considered. For study MB102229 a 
tipping point analyses and a placebo based imputation were presented. 
Rules for imputing the date T1DM was diagnosed if partially missing were pre-specified in the SAP. 
For other analyses and summaries of efficacy, safety, outcome research measures, missing values 
were not imputed. 
If laboratory samples were inadvertently analysed multiple times for the same test, producing multiple 
lab results on the same collection date and time for the same subject, the selection of laboratory result 
for analysis for this subject followed AZ global standard. 
If the blood pressure measurements were taken at a wrong position, e.g., sitting instead of standing, 
then these measurements were excluded from the summary/analysis.

Conduct of the study 
Amendments 
MB102229 
Five amendments, two of which were country-specific, were made to the protocol. The first 
amendment was made before first subject enrolled, and all amendments were made before last 
subject completed. The most important changes are provided in the following. 
Amendment #3 (May 2015) concerned the removal of exclusion criteria stating that HbA1c may not 
drop more than 0.5% during the lead-in phase after consultation with EMA/SAWP (EMA/248307/2015) 
since the requirement does not reflect clinical practice and had resulted in feasibility issues. 
With amendment #5 (May 2016), the randomisation target was increased by 55 subjects due to the 
IVRS randomisation system error. In addition, recommendations on insulin reductions and other 
measures to avoid hypoglycaemia and DKA were clarified.  
MB102230 
Five amendments, two of which were country-specific, were made to the protocol. All but one 
amendment (#5) were made before first subject enrolled, and all amendments were made before last 
subject completed. The most important changes are provided in the following. 
Amendment #3 (May 2015) concerned the removal of exclusion criteria stating that HbA1c may not

With amendment #5 (May 2016), recommendations on insulin reductions and other measures to avoid 
hypoglycaemia and DKA were clarified. 
Protocol deviations 
In study MB102229, few subjects (33 [4.2%]) who were included in the full analysis set had a relevant 
protocol deviation during the 24-week treatment period. In addition, 55 subjects that were affected by 
an IVRS error were excluded from the full analysis set. The most common protocol deviation was 
randomised subjects who did not take any study drug for ≥2 consecutive weeks. Per-protocol analysis 
was not conducted due to the small number of protocol deviations. 
In study MB102230, few subjects (42 [5.2%] overall) in the full analysis set had a relevant protocol 
deviation during the 24-week treatment period. The most common protocol deviation was randomised

conducted due to the small number of protocol deviations. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups within studies 
MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 8). In study MB102229, most subjects were white (95.6%) and 
randomised at study sites in Europe (59.3%). In study MB102230, 78.4% of subjects were white and 
19.7% of subjects were Asian; most were randomised at study sites in North America or Europe 
(34.6% and 33.5%, respectively).  
Common diabetes complications were as expected for subjects with this T1DM disease duration.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variable: change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 
The primary analysis demonstrated statistically significant reductions in HbA1c with dapagliflozin 5 mg 
and 10 mg compared with placebo following 24 weeks of treatment in both study MB102229 and 
MB102230 (Table 11). 
The de facto (intention-to-treat) estimand for the primary efficacy variable was estimated as a 
sensitivity analysis in both studies. In study MB102229, the de facto estimand for the adjusted mean 
change compared with placebo in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was -0.41% for dapagliflozin 5 mg 
(95% CI: -0.55, -0.28) and -0.39% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.26) for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study 
MB102230, the de facto estimand for the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 24 was -0.32% for dapagliflozin 5 mg (95% CI: -0.45, -0.19) and -0.39% (95% CI: 
-0.52, -0.25) for dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
Table 11 Primary efficacy variable in studies MB102229/MB102230: HbA1c at 
Week 24 (full analysis set) 
In both studies, most of the reduction in HbA1c in the dapagliflozin treatment groups occurred over the 
first 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained for the duration of the ST treatment period (Figure 
20). The reduction of HbA1c appeared to be maintained up to Week 52 in the LT extension of study 
MB102229; see section “Ancillary analysis” for a detailed discussion of the ST+LT efficacy results.

Secondary efficacy variables 
Percent change in total daily insulin dose 
Statistically significant reductions in total daily insulin dose were demonstrated for each of the 
dapagliflozin doses compared with placebo at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 
12).

insulin dose at Week 24 (full analysis set) 
This image cannot currently be displayed.
In study MB102229, the proportional reductions seen for basal and bolus insulin individually were 
similar to the proportional reduction in total insulin (dapagliflozin 5 mg group, basal -12% and bolus -
14%; dapagliflozin 10 mg group, basal -14% and bolus -18%; placebo group, basal -0.6% and bolus -
4.6%). 
In study MB102230, the proportional reductions seen for basal and bolus insulin individually were 
similar in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group (-11% and -12%) whereas in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group 
there was a greater reduction in basal insulin than in bolus insulin (-17% and -8%). There was no net 
change in the placebo group (1.5% and -2.6%). 
Percent change in body weight 
Statistically significant reductions in body weight were demonstrated for each of the dapagliflozin 
doses compared with placebo at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 13). 
Each dapagliflozin group in the 2 studies exhibited continuous weight loss over the 24-week ST 
treatment periods (Figure 22 and Figure 23).

Change in mean value of 24-hour glucose readings 
Statistically significant reductions in mean CGM readings were demonstrated for each of the 
dapagliflozin doses compared with placebo at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 
14). 
In both studies, the effect was similar at Weeks 12 and 24.

Change in mean amplitude of glucose excursions 
Statistically significant reductions in MAGE were demonstrated for each of the dapagliflozin doses 
compared with placebo at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 15). The 
reductions in the dapagliflozin groups compared with placebo were greater in study MB102229 than in

Change in percentage of 24-hour glucose readings falling within the range of >70 mg/dL to 
≤180 mg/dL 
Statistically significant increases in the percentage of glucose readings falling within the range of >70 
mg/dL to ≤180 mg/dL were demonstrated for each of the dapagliflozin doses compared with placebo 
at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230 (Table 16). 
The increase in the percentage of readings >70 mg/dL to ≤180 mg/dL seen with dapagliflozin was not 
accompanied by any clinically relevant increase in the percentage of readings ≤70 mg/dL at Week 24. 
In study MB102229, there was a small numerical decrease in the percentage of readings ≤70 mg/dL in 
both dapagliflozin groups; adjusted mean change compared with placebo from baseline to Week 24 
was -0.43% (95% CI: -1.24, -0.38) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.47% (95% CI: -1.28, -0.34) for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study MB102230, there were no relevant changes in the percentage of 
readings ≤70 mg/dL in the dapagliflozin groups; adjusted mean change compared with placebo from 
baseline to Week 24 was +0.46% (95% CI: -0.23, 1.16) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and +0.70% (95% CI: 
0.00, 1.39) for dapagliflozin 10 mg.

Proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c reduction of ≥0.5% without severe 
hypoglycaemia events 
Statistically significant increases in the proportion of subjects achieving ≥0.5% reductions in HbA1c 
without severe hypoglycaemia events were demonstrated for each of the dapagliflozin doses compared 
with placebo at Week 24 in both study MB102229 and MB102230. In both studies, approximately twice 
as many patients experienced a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without severe hypoglycaemia events in 
the dapagliflozin groups compared with the placebo group. 
In study MB102229, the proportions of subjects experiencing a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without 
severe hypoglycaemia events were 49.6% and 50.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, 
respectively, compared with 25.3% in the placebo group. In study MB102230, the proportions of 
subjects experiencing a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without severe hypoglycaemia events were 39.5% 
and 41.6% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 20.1% in the 
placebo group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Long-term data 
Studies MB102229 and MB102230 both have 24-week ST treatment periods and LT extension periods 
of 28 weeks. The primary and secondary efficacy objectives procedure comprised variables at Week 
24. The efficacy analyses at Week 52 were exploratory, and no p-values were calculated for 
comparisons at Week 52. 
Assessment report

In study MB102229, a total of 747 subjects entered the LT extension period of the study. Similar 
proportions of subjects in each treatment group completed the 52-week ST+LT treatment period: 
84.8%, 86.1%, and 83.8% of the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The median number of days of exposure to dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, or 
placebo was 364.0 days at Week 52. 
The effect of dapagliflozin observed on the primary variable at Week 24 appeared to be maintained at 
Week 52 (Table 17). 
Table 17 HbA1c at Week 52 in study MB102229 (full analysis set) 
The secondary variables body weight and proportion of subjects achieving ≥0.5% reductions in HbA1c 
without severe hypoglycaemia events were re-analysed at Week 52 in an exploratory manner. The 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline to Week 52 was -2.95% 
(95% CI: -3.83%, -2.06%) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -4.54% (95% CI: -5.40%, -3.66%) for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg (Figure 25). The proportion of subjects achieving ≥0.5% reductions in HbA1c 
without severe hypoglycaemia events from baseline to Week 52 was 40.2%, 42.1%, and 23.7% for 
the dapagliflozin 5 mg group, the dapagliflozin 10 mg group, and the placebo group, respectively.

Figure 25 Change from baseline in total body weight over time – 52-week short-
term plus long-term treatment period (full analysis set) 
Insulin dose during the LT extension was recorded on a weekly basis, and the reduction in insulin dose 
observed at Week 24 appeared to be maintained at Week 52. Since study CGM was not used after 
Week 24, the Week 52 analyses did not include mean value of 24-hour glucose readings, mean 
amplitude of glucose excursions, or percentage of 24-hour glucose readings falling within the range of 
>70 mg/dL to ≤180 mg/dL. 
In study MB102230, a total of 717 subjects entered the LT extension period of the study. Similar 
proportions of subjects in each treatment group completed the 52-week ST+LT treatment period: 
85.2%, 83.7%, and 79.4% for the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The median number of days of exposure to dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, or 
placebo was 365.0 days at Week 52. 
The adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52 was -0.11%, -0.16%, and 0.09% for 
the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, corresponding to a 
mean change versus placebo of -0.20% (95% CI: -0.34%, -0.06%) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.25% 
(95% CI: -0.38%, -0.11%) for dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
The secondary variables body weight and proportion of subjects achieving ≥0.5% reductions in HbA1c 
without severe hypoglycaemia events were re-analysed at Week 52 in an exploratory manner. The 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline to Week 52 was -4.42% 
(95% CI: -5.19%, -3.64%) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -4.86% (95% CI: -5.63%, -4.08%) for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg. The proportion of subjects experiencing a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without 
severe hypoglycaemia events was 32.7% and 32.2% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg 
groups, respectively, compared with 20.8% in the placebo group.  
Insulin dose during the LT extension was recorded on a weekly basis, and the reduction in insulin dose 
observed at Week 24 appeared to be maintained at Week 52.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
Comparison of results in sub-populations 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the consistency of the treatment effect across 
subgroups for change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24. The prespecified subgroup categories in 
studies MB102229 and MB102230 were sex, race, ethnicity, baseline HbA1c, age, geographic region, 
method of insulin administration, use of CGM, and baseline BMI. 
Data from studies MB102229 and MB102230 were pooled to provide greater sensitivity to detect 
variations in treatment effect across subgroups. Overall, the effect on HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 
was consistent across the subgroups evaluated (Figure 26). 
The effect on HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was also consistent across subgroups when evaluated 
individually for each study. 
Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints that included only subjects randomised to US study sites 
were conducted in studies MB102229 and MB102230. The results of these US-specific analyses were 
generally consistent with the overall analyses.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical study program supporting the use of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients consists of two Phase 
III studies of similar design, MB102229 and MB102230. Both were randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group studies. The duration of the run-in (8 weeks) and treatment phases (24 
weeks and 28 weeks, short- and long-term respectively) were accepted by the CHMP in scientific 
advice given. Study MB102229 had been finalised at the time of submission, whereas data for the 28 
week extension of study MB102230 was provided with the responses to the 1st RSI.

No formal dose finding study was performed; instead the doses chosen for the Phase III studies were 
selected based on the data obtained from study MB102072 as well as from the data in T2DM. In T2DM, 
5 mg and 10 mg has been established as the minimally effective doses. The rationale for dose 
selection is adequate from an efficacy perspective. Both the 5 mg and 10 mg dose was investigated in 
the studies. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered adequate. Although patients with frequent 
hypoglycaemias and highly variable blood glucose may be a target population for treatment, it was 
accepted to exclude this population for safety reasons. Patients were to be on a total insulin dose of 
≥0.3 U/kg/day in order to reduce the risk of ketoacidosis in lean patients. Subjects were also excluded 
if they had been admitted to a hospital because of hyper- or hypoglycaemia or had experienced 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring medical intervention within 1 month of the screening visit. Study 
MB102229 initially included an eligibility criterion excluding subjects whose HbA1c changed ≥0.5% 
between enrolment and randomisation. Because this criterion accounted for approximately 80% of 
subjects being ineligible for randomisation after completing the lead-in period and did not reflect 
clinical practice, the MAH amended the study protocol to remove the criterion after consultation with 
the CHMP. 
Comparison with placebo was accepted by the CHMP and justified by the fact that the insulin dose of a 
subject could be up- or down-titrated as deemed appropriate to be consistent with good medical 
practice. Furthermore, no other medicinal products than insulin are available for the treatment of 
T1DM. 
No fixed titration schedules were used in the study. Insulin doses could be adjusted as deemed 
appropriate to be consistent with good medical practice according to SMBG readings, local guidance 
and individual circumstances. Recommendations were given on dose reductions in order to avoid 
hypoglycaemia after the first dose of study drug. Insulin dose reductions of > 20% from baseline were 
not recommended in order to avoid DKA. In case of hypoglycaemias in spite of a 20 % reduction of the 
insulin dose, the patients were recommended to increase their carbohydrate intake.  
The primary objective was to compare the effect of dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg versus placebo on 
the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients on an optimised and adjustable insulin treatment. 
Secondary objectives compared the effect on change in total insulin dose and body weight, but also on 
the effect on blood glucose variability when measured by CGM. To investigate the effect on 
hypoglycaemias in relation to HbA1c reduction, the proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c 
reduction ≥0.5% without severe hypoglycaemic events was included as a secondary endpoint. The 
objectives and endpoints were adequate and as agreed in SA. 
The sample sizes calculations were adequate. A randomisation error affected the first 55 patients in 
study MB102229. The choice to exclude these patients from the efficacy analyses is endorsed. With 
these patients excluded the randomisation error is unlikely to affect the efficacy analyses.  
The study was double-blinded although it may be questioned whether the subjects could have 
identified that they were on active therapy due to effects on blood glucose and urinary volume. 
However, there is no indication in the pattern of study discontinuation that treatment group was known 
to the subjects. In summary, the blinding is considered adequately handled.  
In summary the statistical methodology for both trials (MB102229 and MB102230) are generally 
considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint is change of HbA1c after 24 weeks analysed using a mixed model for repeated 
measures analysis (MMRM) and targeting a treatment effect as if patients adhered to treatment until 
week 24.

Missing data are a minor problem for the two pivotal studies with less (Study 29) and around 10% 
(Study 30) withdrawals and similar withdrawal patterns between the treatment arms. The primary 
efficacy analysis is based on a MAR assumption and it is not possible to know if this assumption is 
applicable. There is some indication that missing data is associated with an increased HBA1C-level 
before drop out (figure 12.1.9.5 study MB102229) and other methods, such as placebo based 
imputation, may be considered giving more adequate estimates of efficacy. Results from the placebo 
based imputation analysis presented for study MB102229 and MB102230 does however show very 
similar point estimates to the primary efficacy analysis. The LOCF sensitivity analysis did also give 
consistent results. 
While the primary efficacy target of estimation, or estimand, and type of analysis was common 
standard in studies for antidiabetic drugs in recent years, current discussions could suggest that other 
targets of estimation could be preferable. These could be targets of estimation using data regardless of 
treatment discontinuation or analyses with (multiple) imputations based on observations from patients 
of the same treatment arm discontinuing treatment, but not withdrawing from the trial. 
The Applicant adequately addressed the issue by including the analyses described above, partly 
addressing different targets of estimation. While these analyses might not be considered sensitivity 
analysis in the sense of the draft ICH E9 addendum, they demonstrate that the different effect 
estimates result in very comparable results. They also suggest that analyses for secondary endpoints, 
which are using an analysis close to the defined primary analysis, are interpretable in the same way 
and should allow robust conclusions. 
Statistical methods for secondary and exploratory endpoints are considered acceptable. Extending the 
additional “sensitivity analysis” for the primary analysis to the secondary endpoints would have been 
welcomed. However, as results of the different analyses for the primary endpoint, partly targeting a 
different target of estimation, are very similar and the secondary analyses close to the primary 
analysis method, one may indirectly conclude that “sensitivity analysis” for the secondary endpoints 
using an analysis close to the primary analysis would also have similar results. 
For the responder endpoint “proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c reduction from baseline to 
Week 24 of ≥0.5% without severe hypoglycaemia events”, a logistic regression model using LOCF 
week 24 data was applied. While the LOCF single imputation approach is not considered to have 
acceptable properties and a multiple imputation approach similar to the “de-facto estimand” for the 
primary analysis would have been preferred, it is considered most unlikely that conclusions from an 
analysis using a different imputation approach would change conclusions due to the large observed 
effect compared to placebo. 
The control of the type I error is considered acceptable. The primary and secondary efficacy variables 
were analysed and statistically tested in a pre-specified stepwise procedure. The pivotal studies use a 
standard parallel group design with two active doses compared to placebo. A Dunnett and Tamhane 
step-up procedure was chosen to control the type I error with regards to testing of the two doses. The 
Dunnett and Tamhane step-up procedure needs some assumptions about correlation and data 
structure in the two dose arms, but these are most likely fulfilled in a study setting with two doses like 
in the pivotal trial and therefore the primary analysis is acceptable. Although no interim analyses were 
performed, study MB102229 was divided into two parts, a 24 week follow up and a 52 week follow 
up with un-blinding at 24 weeks. The efficacy endpoints were however defined for the 24 week time 
point so this is not considered to inflate the type I error rate.  
The methodology for subgroups analyses to assess the homogeneity of results is considered 
appropriate. Tests for interaction to assess heterogeneity are considered informative, but there is no 
Assessment report

Page 67/116 
 
 
 
 
commonly accepted statistical method to assess homogeneity of heterogeneity of results. Exploratory 
subgroup analyses are acceptable and are considered more important than interaction tests. 
In study MB102229, there were two amendments made (#3 and #5) that could potentially influence 
the outcome and interpretation of the data. With amendment #3 the change in exclusion criteria was 
introduced as discussed above. This may have resulted in a change in the characteristics of the 
patients included after the amendment. This amendment came into effect 6 month after the enrolment 
of the first patient. Amendment #5 was introduced one year later. With this amendment the number of 
patients to be enrolled was increased by 55 to compensate for the exclusion of the patients enrolled 
before the error in the IVRS randomisation system was discovered. The MAH has clarified that only 121 
out of 778 patients were included before amendment #3 and included in the final analysis, thus the 
characteristics of the population is not expected to be affected to any greater extent. 
Both amendments were also made to the protocol for study MB102230, but only amendment #5 came 
into effect after the inclusion of the first patient in this study. Amendment #5 also included 
clarifications on how to change the insulin doses. The MAH has clarified that in study MB102229, six 
out of 778 patients, and in study MB102230, 315 out of 815 patients were included after amendment 
#5. Thus, the majority of patients in both studies were not exposed to the new recommendations at 
study start. This may have implications for the interpretation of the efficacy of the recommendations 
as a means for avoiding DKA but is not considered to have affected the outcome of the study.  
In both studies, protocol deviations were few and evenly distributed between treatment groups. There 
are no concerns with regards to the general conduct of the studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study MB10229, 91.3%, 92.2%, and 89.2% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively, completed the ST period. For the 52-week ST+LT treatment period: 
84.8%, 86.1%, and 83.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups 
completed the study. The corresponding figures for the ST period in study MB102230 were 90.0%, 
90.7%, and 87.9% for the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups. For the 52-
week ST+LT treatment period: 85.2%, 83.7%, and 79.4% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg, and placebo groups completed the study. Thus in both studies, discontinuation rates were 
generally low and balanced between groups.  In the ST period, withdrawals due to adverse events 
were rather balanced between groups. In the LT period, discontinuations due to adverse events were 
only observed in the dapagliflozin treated groups. 
Baseline demographic characteristics were generally balanced both between treatment groups and 
between studies. Mean HbA1c was comparable in both studies (8.53% and 8.43% in study MB102229 
and MB102230, respectively). Mean BMI was rather high (about 28 kg/m2) in both studies compared 
with what is typical for the T1DM patient population in European countries (approximately 25 kg/m2, 
[Stadler et al., Diabetes Obes Metab. 2017;19:1171–1178]). About 35% of subjects in both studies 
used CSII. GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was reported for about 4.1% and 3.1% of subjects in study 
MB102229 and MB102230, respectively. In study MB102229, 59% of subjects were recruited in Europe 
and in study MB102230, 34% of subjects were European. Study MB102230 also included 19% 
Japanese subjects. 
In both studies, a statistically significant but modest decrease in HbA1c from baseline was observed for 
both dapagliflozin doses. The outcome was comparable between studies and there was no apparent 
difference in between the doses. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the result. In study MB102229, the 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was -0.42% (95% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 68/116 
 
 
 
 
CI: 0.56, -0.28; p<0.0001) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.45% (95% CI: -0.58, -0.31; p<0.0001) for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study MB102230, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in HbA1c 
from baseline to Week 24 was -0.37% (95% CI: -0.49, -0.26; p<0.0001) for dapagliflozin 5 mg 
and -0.42% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.30; p<0.0001) for dapagliflozin 10 mg. The lowest HbA1c was 
observed between week 4 and week 12, after which a slight increase was observed at week 18. From 
week 18 and up to week 24, the HbA1c remained stable. It should be noted that, although the 
improvement in glycaemic control was small, it was achieved despite a concomitant reduction in insulin 
requirements.  
While reduction in insulin dose is not a recognized benefit in itself, it may reduce risk of hypoglycaemia 
and weight gain. In both studies, the total daily insulin dose was significantly decreased with both 
dapagliflozin doses compared to placebo. In spite of high HbA1c at inclusion (mean of about 8.5%), no 
increase in total insulin dose was observed in the placebo treated groups. This may be explained by 
the fact that insulin doses were increased during insulin therapy optimisation during lead-in and a 
further change (increase) in insulin dose has not necessarily to be expected during the course of the 
study. Numerically, there was almost no difference in the change in total insulin dose between 
dapagliflozin doses or between studies, the percent change from baseline ranging from -9% to -13%. 
It should be noted that more detailed recommendations on how to reduce the insulin dose was 
introduced during the course of the studies through amendment #5 of the protocol; this potentially 
affected more patients in study MB102230. There was however no apparent difference in the outcome 
between studies. In general, the proportional reductions seen for basal and bolus insulin individually 
were similar to the proportional reduction in total insulin, thus both basal and bolus insulin were 
reduced to the same extent. 
In study MB102229, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline 
to Week 24 was -3.05% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and -3.72% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study 
MB102230, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline to Week 
24 was -3.21% for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -3.74% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. A small part of this 
reduction is probably due to the diuretic effect of dapagliflozin but a reduction in fat mass has been 
clearly shown in the usually overweight patients with T2DM and can be attributed to nutrient loss 
through glucose excretion. While weight (fat) loss is not relevant and not desirable in normal weight 
patients, it can be considered beneficial in overweight/obese patients; similar to the general 
population, overweight/obesity is an increasing problem also in patients with T1DM. In the two phase 3 
studies presented here, most of the participants were overweight or obese. In absolute terms, the 
placebo-corrected weight loss was around 2 kg in the normal weight group and was up to 3.65 kg in 
obese patients receiving 10 mg dapagliflozin. In all subsets the weight loss was lower with 5 mg 
dapagliflozin than with 10 mg dapagliflozin, indicating a dose-dependent effect. 
There was a comparable and significant decrease in mean value of 24-hour glucose readings (CGM) in 
both studies. The difference from placebo was larger for the 10 mg dose compared to the 5 mg dose in 
both studies (-15 vs -18 in study MB102229 and -16 vs -20 in study MB102230). This is in line with 
the observed decrease in HbA1c. Surprisingly, the most profound glucose-lowering effect of 
dapagliflozin in combination with insulin compared to insulin alone was found to occur during the early 
morning hours. It can only be speculated that dapagliflozin counteracts what is called the dawn 
phenomenon by increasing urinary glucose excretion in response to rising blood glucose levels. 
Another possible explanation could be that renal glucose excretion continues during the night. As no 
food intake compensates for this glucose loss, blood glucose steadily decreases.  
In T1DM patients, a decreased variability in blood glucose is an important treatment target in order to 
allow optimisation of the insulin therapy. Therefore, the following secondary endpoints investigating 
the effect on blood glucose variability are considered important. The mean amplitude of glucose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 69/116 
 
 
 
 
excursions decreased significantly for both dapagliflozin doses in both studies. The decrease was more 
pronounced in study MB102229 compared to study MB102230. The percentage of 24-hour glucose 
readings falling within the range of >70 mg/dL to ≤180 mg/dL increased with both doses of 
dapagliflozin compared to placebo, with a numerically larger increase with the higher dose (9% vs 
11%). The outcome was comparable in both studies. This was achieved without any relevant change in 
the percentage of readings ≤70 mg/dL in the dapagliflozin groups in either of the studies (about 
±0.5%). Together these two secondary endpoints indicate that the variability in glucose decreased 
with dapagliflozin treatment. In order to assess whether this effect was driven by the method of insulin 
administration subgroup analyses of these two endpoints by method of administration, i.e. injections 
and CSII, was provided. The data provided does not indicate that the outcome with regards to glucose 
variability was driven by the method of administration. 
The proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c reduction of ≥0.5% without severe hypoglycaemia 
events was twice as high in the dapagliflozin treated groups compared to placebo. There was no 
relevant difference between dapagliflozin doses but the proportions were higher in study MB102229 
(49.6% and 50.8% for 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, 25.3% for placebo) than in study MB102230 
(39.5% and 41.6% for 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively, 20.1% for placebo). It is known that (the fear 
of) hypoglycaemia is the main obstacle to improving glycaemic control in this patient population. 
Therefore, this finding may be clinically relevant. HbA1c reductions of this magnitude, if maintained, 
are expected to translate into some reduction of microvascular complications. 
Exploratory data from the finalised 28 week extension phase of study MB102229 show that the 
placebo-adjusted change from baseline in HbA1c was largely maintained up to 52 weeks (-0.33% at 52 
weeks vs -0.42% at 24 weeks with dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.36% at 52 weeks vs -0.45% at 24 weeks 
with dapagliflozin 10 mg). A similar pattern was observed in study MB102230 (-0.20% at 52 weeks vs 
-0.37% at 24 weeks with dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.25% at 52 weeks vs -0.42% at 24 weeks with 
dapagliflozin 10 mg), although the attenuation of the glycaemic effect was slightly larger in this study. 
Reduction of body weight was maintained, but there did not appear to be any further decline in body 
weight after week 32. The weight reduction was more pronounced in patients treated with the 10 mg 
dose. Similar results were observed in both studies. There was a decrease in the proportion of patients 
achieving ≥0.5% reductions in HbA1c without severe hypoglycaemia events in the dapagliflozin treated 
groups at week 52 compared to week 24. The decrease ranged from 6.8% to 9.4% in the dapagliflozin 
treated groups and whereas the proportion remained more stable in the placebo treated groups (-
1.6% and +0.7%, MB102229 and MB102230, respectively). The difference versus placebo was 
however maintained. Overall the long-term data was consistent across the two studies. 
A subgroup analysis was performed on pooled data from studies MB102229 and MB102230. The 
subgroups selected were adequate. The analysis showed consistent outcomes in all subgroups with 
regards to the primary endpoint, including analysis by age and BMI. The subgroup of patients with 
GFR<60 was small and showed wide CIs. The subgroup with GFR<60 and treated with dapagliflozin 
10 mg was the only subgroup for which the 95% CI included 0.  
The MAH made efforts to identify a population which could have a higher benefit than average from 
dapagliflozin addition and to identify patients who are at particular risk for developing DKA. According 
to the analyses provided, overweight/obese type 1 diabetic patients with a high basal insulin need may 
benefit from dapagliflozin treatment. In addition, patients with highly variable blood glucose levels 
(measured as MAGE) could theoretically benefit from dapagliflozin treatment.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The application is supported by two Phase III studies of similar design. The outcomes of the studies 
are consistent and show that treatment with both doses of dapagliflozin (5 mg and 10 mg) results in a 
modest reduction in HbA1c, without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. In addition, a weight 
reduction is observed and also a decrease in blood glucose variability. The outcome of the studies 
appears robust. The effect seems to be similar in different subgroups, but patients with 
overweight/obesity are expected to benefit more from the combined effect on CV risk factors also 
considering that further increase of the insulin dose may not be adequate in these patients since that 
would lead to additional weight gain.  
There is virtually no difference in the extent of HbA1c reduction between the 5 mg and 10 mg 
dapagliflozin group. This finding was consistent in both pivotal studies. Therefore, only the 5 mg dose 
is recommended for use in the T1DM population.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Dapagliflozin, human renal SGLT2 inhibitor, inhibits the renal reabsorption of glucose, causing glucose 
to be excreted in the urine and thereby lowering plasma glucose levels in an insulin-independent 
manner. The amount of glucose excreted depends on the amount of glucose filtered by the kidney, 
which in turn depends on the plasma glucose concentration and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 
The safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin were thoroughly investigated and documented in the original 
submission for approval of dapagliflozin for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The original 
T2DM submission has been supplemented over time with updated information on the safety and 
tolerability of dapagliflozin, notably with data from a 30-month update cut-off relative to the original 
data cut and with extensive post-marketing data.  
The safety profile of dapagliflozin is characterised by an increased risk of urogenital infections and 
volume depletions related adverse reactions due to the mechanism of action which results in increased 
excretion of glucose in the urine and increased urinary volume. The inherent risk of hypoglycaemia 
with dapagliflozin is low and rather related to the background therapy used, i.e. SU or insulin. Post-
marketing, an increased risk of (euglycaemic) diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA) has been observed. 
New data 
With this application, information on the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is provided and compared with the known safety profile of dapagliflozin. Data 
primarily come from 2 Phase III global studies of dapagliflozin as add-on to insulin therapy in subjects 
with T1DM: studies MB102229 and MB102230. Data from a United States (US) Phase IIa pilot study, 
MB102072, and from a Japanese Phase I/III study, D1695C00001, are briefly summarised but are 
generally not included in the overall discussion of adverse events (AEs) or clinical laboratory 
evaluations due to one or more of their short duration, small study size, or lack of placebo control. 
Pooling strategy 
To detect potential imbalances in less common AEs and to provide an overview of the experience with 
dapagliflozin in subjects with T1DM, ST data from studies MB1020229 and MB102230 were pooled (the 
‘ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool’). Data from studies MB102072 and D1695C00001 (Part A) were 
not included in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool due to their short treatment periods and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 71/116 
 
 
 
 
limited number of subjects. Data from study D1695C00001 (Part B) were not included in the pool as 
this part of the study was not placebo-controlled. Long-term data from studies MB102229, MB102230 
and D1695C00001 (Part B) are presented separately. 
Safety variables collected and methods of evaluation 
Safety assessments in the dapagliflozin T1DM studies included the adjudication of certain events by 
blinded independent adjudication committees: 
•  Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) Adjudication Committee (DKAAC). Potential DKA events sent to 
adjudication were identified based on recorded ketone test results, symptoms potentially 
associated with DKA, and relevant risk factors in the subject diary. Over 20000 ketone (beta-
hydroxybutyrate) readings were recorded. 
•  Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee. 
•  Hepatic Adjudication Committee 
The safety analysis set for each of the dapagliflozin T1DM studies consisted of all randomised subjects 
who received at least one dose of study drug. Any subjects receiving incorrect study drug for the entire 
course of their participation were assessed according to the treatment that they actually received. 
Studies MB102229 and MB102230 
The following AEs of special interest were assessed in studies MB102229 and MB102230: 
hypoglycaemia, DKA, cardiovascular AEs, hepatobiliary AEs, genital infections, urinary tract infections, 
volume depletion, fractures, worsening renal function, and hypersensitivity. Each of these AEs of 
special interest is discussed individually in subsequent sections. 
Events of hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemic episodes, and discontinuation due to hypoglycaemia were 
recorded separately from other AEs on electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) pages for hypoglycaemia. 
Investigators reported all potential DKA events to a blinded and independent adjudication committee. 
The assessment of DKA events was based on the adjudicated outcomes. 
The assessments of the remaining AEs of special interest were primarily based pre-specified lists of 
preferred terms (PTs), coded for this SCS according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 20.0. 
Cardiovascular events and liver-related abnormalities were also subject to blinded and independent 
adjudication. The adjudicated outcomes for cardiovascular events and liver-related abnormalities 
supplemented the overall assessment of cardiovascular and hepatobiliary AEs based on pre-specified 
PTs. 
Studies MB102072 and D1695C00001 (Part A & Part B) 
The collection and assessment of safety variables was similar in studies MB102072 and D1695C00001 
(Part A and Part B) to that for studies MB102229 and MB102230, with the exception that there was no 
adjudication of potential DKA events in study MB102072. 
Patient exposure 
There were 1797 subjects randomised in the T1DM Phase III studies, of whom 1265 were treated with 
dapagliflozin. A total of 1155 subjects completed 24 weeks of treatment with dapagliflozin. The long-
term extensions of studies MB102229 and D1695C00001 (Part B) are complete: 562 subjects were

treated with dapagliflozin for >360 days. Cumulative exposure to dapagliflozin across the T1DM Phase 
III studies is 906.8 patient-years. 
Table 20 summarises the extent of exposure to study drug in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Mean exposure was similar across all treatment groups. Cumulative exposure to study drug was 
greater in the dapagliflozin treatment groups than in placebo, which was primarily due to the higher 
numbers of subjects in the dapagliflozin groups as a result of the randomisation system error in study 
MB102229.

Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pooled population, the treatment groups were generally 
balanced with respect to demographic, disease, and baseline characteristics. Table 21 summarises key 
characteristics.

Adverse events 
The primary presentations in this section are of data from the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
These data are discussed in the context of the known safety profile of dapagliflozin, as derived from 
the dapagliflozin T2DM clinical programme, and any differences from this known safety profile of 
dapagliflozin are addressed in detail. Long-term data from studies MB102229 and D1695C00001 (Part 
B) are also discussed. Only death and DKA data from studies MB102072 and D1695C00001 (Part A) 
are presented in the following. 
Overall adverse events 
Table 22 is an overall AE summary for the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. The proportion of 
subjects with any AE was higher in the dapagliflozin treatment groups than the placebo group. The 
slightly higher rates of events in the dapagliflozin treatment groups were mainly driven by known side 
effects of dapagliflozin, such as genital infections and increased urinary frequency/output. Ketone-
related events were also more frequent in the dapagliflozin treatment groups. Note that Table 22 only 
Assessment report

includes hypoglycaemia and DKA events reported as SAEs; hypoglycaemia and DKA events are 
discussed under “Adverse events of special interest”. 
Table 22 Overall adverse events summary – ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool 
(safety analysis set) 
Overall AE analyses for the ST+LT treatment period of study MB102229 were consistent with the data 
from the ST treatment period of study MB102229. Analyses of AE data from the LT period of study 
MB102229 and from study D1695C00001 (Part B) did not identify any safety concerns. 
Adverse events by system organ class and preferred term 
The most common AEs by system organ class (SOC) in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool were 
Infections and infestations and Gastrointestinal disorders. 
The higher proportion of AEs in the dapagliflozin treatment groups (70.1% and 68.6% in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively) compared to placebo (62.4%) can primarily be 
attributed to differences in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (43.1%, 41.5%, and 36.5% in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively) and Renal and 
urinary disorders (10.0%, 11.0%, and 4.5%, respectively). Genital infections and urinary tract 
infections are discussed under “Adverse events of special interest”. Increased urinary 
frequency/output, a known side effect of dapagliflozin, accounted for the majority of events in the 
Renal and urinary disorders SOC; none of these events were recorded as serious SAEs and these 
events are not discussed further in this SCS. 
The distribution of AEs by SOC and PT in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool is considered 
consistent with the known safety profile of dapagliflozin after taking into account the differing 
background rates of certain AEs between study populations, including the higher overall rate of genital 
infections in those with T1DM than T2DM (de Leon et al 2002). Table 23 presents the most common 
AEs by PT.

Table 23 Adverse event summary: adverse events by Preferred Term, ≥2% in any 
treatment group – 24-week short-term period – ST placebo-controlled Phase III 
pool (safety analysis set) 
Most AEs reported in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool were of mild intensity. Few subjects 
experienced an AE assessed as very severe in intensity: 2, 4, and 3 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019

There were more AEs assessed by the Investigator as related to study drug in the dapagliflozin 
treatment groups than the placebo group: 28.6%, 27.0%, and 11.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. As with the overall AEs, the difference can 
primarily be attributed to events associated with genital infections and increased urinary 
frequency/output. 
Data on AEs by SOC and PT from the ST+LT period of study MB102229 and from study D1695C00001 
(Part B) were consistent with the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Serious adverse event 
Table 24 is a summary of SAEs by SOC for the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. SAEs were 
reported in 6.8%, 5.5%, and 3.8% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and 
placebo treatment groups, respectively. 
SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders and were primarily 
ketone-related. DKA events are discussed under “Adverse events of special interest”. There were few 
SAEs in any other SOC and they generally occurred in similar proportions across all treatment groups.

The distribution of SAEs in the pooled T1DM studies was consistent with the known safety profile of 
dapagliflozin, except that there were more ketone-related SAEs in the pooled T1DM studies than were 
observed in T2DM studies. 
SAE data from the ST+LT period of study MB102229 and from study D1695C00001 (Part B) were 
consistent with the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Deaths 
There was 1 death, in a placebo-group subject, in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. There were 
no deaths in studies MB102072 or D1695C00001 or in the LT period of study MB102229. One 
additional subject in study MB102230 died after enrolment but before the start of the lead-in period. 
The death in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool occurred during study Week 7 in a placebo-group 
subject in study MB102229 who had previously discontinued study drug. The subject died during the 
night due to suspected hypoglycaemia.  
Adverse events of special interest 
The following event categories were included as predefined AEs of special interest in studies MB102229 
and MB102230: hypoglycaemia, DKA, cardiovascular AEs, hepatobiliary AEs, genital infections, urinary 
tract infections, volume depletion, fractures, worsening renal function, and hypersensitivity. Potential 
DKA events, and cardiovascular and hepatobiliary AEs, were adjudicated.  
Hypoglycaemia 
In studies MB102229 and MB102230, events of hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemic episodes, or 
discontinuation due to hypoglycaemia were recorded and analysed separately from other AEs on eCRF 
pages for hypoglycaemia and categorised according to ADA recommendations (ADA 2005). Subjects 
were specifically asked to report symptoms of hypoglycaemia at each visit and a diary for documenting 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia was used. The Investigator had to determine whether symptoms reported 
by the subject met the clinical definition of hypoglycaemia. Only symptoms or blood glucose values 
deemed by the Investigator to meet the definition of hypoglycaemia were to be reported on the 
hypoglycaemia eCRF pages. 
The incidence of overall hypoglycaemia events and severe hypoglycaemia events in the ST placebo-
controlled Phase III pool were similar across all treatment groups (Table 25).

Figure 27 is a Kaplan-Meier plot of time to severe hypoglycaemia AE as per ADA categorisation for the 
ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. There were 38, 42, and 40 subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, who experienced a severe hypoglycaemic 
event, corresponding to Kaplan-Meier percentages at Week 24 of 7.2%, 7.4%, and 7.4% respectively. 
Only 4 subjects, 3 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 1 in the placebo group, discontinued study drug 
due to hypoglycaemia.

The incidence of hypoglycaemia events decreased over time. During the ST+LT treatment period in 
study MB102229 there were 29, 25, and 30 subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, 
and placebo groups, respectively, who experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event, corresponding to 
Kaplan-Meier percentages at Week 52 of 10.7%, 8.9%, and 12.6% respectively. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis 
Identification and assessment of diabetic ketoacidosis events 
Study subjects were advised on how to identify potential signs/symptoms of DKA (e.g., excessive 
thirst, nausea and vomiting, fruity scented breath, and weakness or fatigue) and were provided with 
blood ketone meters (ketones were measured by daily urine ketone testing in study MB102072) and 
instructions for use. Subjects were to record symptoms potentially associated with DKA, blood ketone 
test results, and relevant risk factors in a diary and to contact the study site if their self-measured 
blood ketone reading was ≥0.6 mmol/L. 
Investigators were to identify potential DKA events based on recorded ketone test results, symptoms 
potentially associated with DKA, and relevant risk factors in the subject diary. Potential events were to 
be recorded on the DKA eCRF pages (including ketone test results and symptoms, and risk factors). 
Additionally, Investigators were asked to evaluate if AEs identified by a prespecified list PTs could be 
potential DKA events. If ‘yes’, then these events were also to be sent for adjudication. 
DKA Adjudication Committees, blinded to treatment allocation, independently adjudicated all events 
identified by Investigators as potential DKA events. Potential DKA events were adjudicated as 
‘definite’, ‘possible’, or ‘unlikely’. The DKAAC Charter specified criteria, based on the ADA consensus

statement (Kitabchi et al 2009), to be applied when ascertaining ‘definite’ DKA events. The ‘definite’ 
DKA criteria included venous pH <7.3, HCO3 ≤18 mEq/L [≤18 mmol/L], and at least one of the 
following symptoms: hyperventilation, dehydration, or depressed consciousness/confusion. Events 
adjudicated as not being DKA were to be categorised as ‘possible’ or ‘unlikely’ DKA at the Adjudicators’ 
discretion. No criteria were specified for distinguishing between ‘possible’ and ‘unlikely’ events. For 
events adjudicated as ‘definite’ DKA, Adjudicators were to assess severity according to the ADA 
consensus statement and to identify a primary cause and contributing factors. For completeness, both 
those potential DKA events adjudicated as DKA (i.e., ‘definite’ DKA events) as well as those 
adjudicated as not DKA (i.e., ‘possible’ and ‘unlikely’ DKA events) are presented below. 
Overview of diabetic ketoacidosis events 
Data presentations in the following sections include ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool data, followed 
by ST+LT data from studies MB102229 and D1695C00001 (Part B). 
The MAH considers DKA events adjudicated as ‘definite’ DKA events to be clinically confirmed DKA 
events; the presentations following this overview section will therefore focus on these events. 
Table 26 presents an overview of adjudication outcomes in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Overall, there were more events sent for adjudication in the dapagliflozin groups than in the placebo 
group. 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, 11 (2.0%), 11 (1.9%) and 3 (0.6%) subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as 
a ‘definite’ DKA event (see Table 26). 
Table 26 Summary of subjects with adjudicated diabetic ketoacidosis events – ST 
placebo-controlled Phase III pool (safety analysis set) 
In the ST+LT period of MB102229, 11 (4.0%), 10 (3.4%) and 5 (1.9%) subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 
mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as a ‘definite’ 
DKA event (Table 27).

DKA event (Table 28). 
Table 28 Summary of subjects with adjudicated diabetic ketoacidosis events – 
MB102230 52-week ST+LT treatment period (safety analysis set) 
There were no potential DKA events reported in studies MB102072 or D1695C00001 (Part A). In the 
non-placebo controlled study D1695C00001 (Part B) there were 3 ‘definite’ DKA events in 2 subjects in 
the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 1 subject in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. There was also 1 
‘possible’ DKA event in a subject in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group. 
Diabetic ketoacidosis events adjudicated as ‘definite’ 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, 11 (2.0%), 11 (1.9%) and 3 (0.6%) subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as 
Assessment report

a ‘definite’ DKA event. Study drug was discontinued in 14 subjects, 9 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg 
treatment group and 5 in the dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group, due to AEs of ketoacidosis or 
diabetic ketoacidosis. No subject experienced more than 1 ‘definite’ DKA event. Adjudicators classified 
19 of the 25 events as either mild or moderate severity. 
Treatment consistent with standard practice (i.e., insulin and intravenous fluids) was documented for 
18 of the 25 events, while most of the remaining events were treated with additional insulin. All 
subjects recovered. 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, missed insulin dose and insulin pump failure were the 
most common primary causes and occurred in 15 of the 25 cases (Table 29). In 5 cases there was no 
primary cause identified. Alcohol was a factor in 6 of the events. More events occurred in subjects 
using insulin pumps (16 in subjects using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and 9 in subjects 
using MDI); this observation applied both to the dapagliflozin treatment groups and to the placebo 
group. For 5 of the ‘definite’ events, 2 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg treatment group and 3 in the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group, there were recorded glucose values in the euglycaemic range (p-
glucose <250 mg/dL [<13.875 mmol/L]).

Table 29 Summary of primary cause, contributing factors, and risk factors 
associated with diabetic ketoacidosis events adjudicated as ‘definite’ – ST placebo-
controlled Phase III pool (safety analysis set) 
The ‘definite’ DKA events in the LT studies had similar characteristics to those in the ST placebo-
controlled Phase III pool. Compared to the ST pool, the incidence rate per 100 patient-years was 
increased (9.87, 7.58 and 4.40 for dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg and placebo respectively), 
based on a total of 27 events. Across the entire programme, most events in all treatment groups were 
precipitated by a temporary insufficiency in insulin, whether accidental (e.g., missed dose or pump 
failure) or due to situational increased insulin demand (i.e., some subjects showed signs of infection or 
other serious disease, or had alcohol intake in association with the DKA event). One subject in the LT 
period of study MB102229 had a recurrent ‘definite DKA’ event.

A thorough review of individual events with a focus on identifying potential risk factors for DKA 
associated with use of dapagliflozin did not identify any clear factors (e.g., baseline HbA1c, baseline 
insulin dose per kilogram, insulin dose changes during the study, insulin administration method, 
region) that could prospectively identify those at higher risk of DKA when treated with dapagliflozin. 
Pooled data for the ST+LT periods of studies MB102229 and MB102230 (Figure 28), show that the 
occurrence of ‘definite’ DKA events was evenly distributed over time, and no time point could be 
identified as being of particular risk for the occurrence of DKA.

Diabetic ketoacidosis events adjudicated as ‘possible’ 
Events adjudicated as ‘possible’ DKAs did not qualify as DKAs based on the ADA criteria. There was no 
confirmed acidosis in any of the ‘possible’ cases. Of the 31 ‘possible’ events, 7 events resulted in visits 
to a medical facility, and of these, 3 events resulted in documented treatment for DKA consistent with 
standard practice. 
Risk of DKA in subgroups 
The risk of DKA was analysed by different cut-offs for baseline BMI and baseline total insulin dose. In 
the overall ST+LT population the risk difference vs placebo was 2.64%. In patients with BMI 
≥25kg/m2, the risk difference was 1.88% and in patients with a total insulin dose of ≥0.6IU/kg, the 
risk difference was 1.91%. 
Cardiovascular events 
There were few cardiovascular events in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 2 (0.4%), 5 (0.9%), 
and 2 (0.4%) in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, none of 
which resulted in death. There were no cardiovascular DAEs. The incidence of cardiovascular AEs in LT 
studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Hepatobiliary 
There were few hepatic AEs in any treatment group in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 7 
(1.3%), 8 (1.4%), and 9 (1.7%) in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups,

respectively. The incidence of hepatic AEs in LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled 
Phase III pool. 
There were 3 subjects with adjudicated liver-related abnormalities in the ST placebo-controlled Phase 
III pool. Two dapagliflozin 10 mg-treated subjects in study MB102229 had aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >10X upper limit of normal (ULN) and the events were 
adjudicated as having a ‘possible’ causal relationship to study drug. In both of these cases other 
aetiologies were considered likely: alcoholic liver disease in 1 case and association with a ‘definite DKA 
event’ in the other case. There was 1 placebo-treated subject in study MB102230 with adjudicated 
liver-related abnormalities during the short-term treatment period. This subject had 2 events of 
elevated liver tests sent for adjudication; both events were adjudicated as having ‘unlikely’ causal 
relationship to study drug.  
There were no subjects in the LT extension of study MB102229 with adjudicated liver-related 
abnormalities. There was 1 subject in study D1695C00001 (Part B) with an adjudicated liver-related 
abnormality: an event of AST >10X ULN in a dapagliflozin 5 mg-treated subject was adjudicated as 
having 'unlikely' causal relationship to study drug. 
Genital infections 
Genital infection AEs were more frequent in the dapagliflozin treatment groups than the placebo group 
in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 11.1%, 9.5%, and 2.3% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
A similar proportion of subjects in each treatment group with AEs of genital infection received 
antimicrobial treatment. Few subjects had recurrent events, though more frequently in the 
dapagliflozin treatment groups than the placebo group. However, a lower proportion of subjects with 
events in the dapagliflozin treatment groups than in the placebo group needed additional treatment 
due to inadequate response to the initial course. 
Genital infection AEs were more common in women than men: 15.8% versus 5.1% in the dapagliflozin 
5 mg group, 14.3% versus 4.4% in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group, and 4.3% versus 0% in the placebo 
group. 
Most genital infections were of mild intensity and no genital infection SAEs were reported in any of the 
treatment groups. There were few genital infection DAEs: 3 due to genital infection fungal in the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg group, 2 due to genitourinary tract infection (1 in each of the dapagliflozin 5 mg 
and placebo groups), and 1 due to vulvovaginitis in the placebo group. 
As expected, given the observed higher colonisation rate (odds ratio: 3.4) of Candida species in those 
with T1DM compared to those with T2DM (de Leon et al 2002), the overall proportion of subjects with 
AEs of genital infection was higher in all treatment groups than has been previously observed in 
dapagliflozin studies in subjects with T2DM. However, the relative ratio of genital infection in 
dapagliflozin-treated subjects to those receiving placebo was similar to previous dapagliflozin 
experience in T2DM. 
The incidence of genital infection AEs in the LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled 
Phase III pool, though with somewhat fewer events. 
Urinary tract infections 
The greatest proportion of subjects with AEs of urinary tract infection (including kidney infections) in 
the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool was in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and the lowest proportion 
in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group: 6.8%, 3.7%, and 4.7% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10

mg, and placebo groups, respectively. There were no meaningful differences in the proportions of 
subjects in each treatment group with AEs of urinary tract infection having recurrent events, though 
more subjects in the dapagliflozin treatment groups received antimicrobial treatment and received 
additional treatment due to inadequate response to the initial course. 
Urinary tract infection AEs were more common in women than men: 11.3% versus 0.8% in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg group, 6.5% versus 0.7% in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group, and 7.8% versus 1.2% 
in the placebo group. 
There were 4 urinary tract infection SAEs reported (1 pyelonephritis and 3 urinary tract infections): 3 
in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 1 in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. There were 6 urinary tract 
infection DAEs: 3, 1, and 2 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. 
The incidence of urinary tract infection AEs in LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-
controlled Phase III pool. 
Volume depletion 
There were few AEs of volume depletion in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 8 (1.5%), 3 
(0.5%), and 4 (0.8%) in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. There were no SAEs or DAEs of volume depletion. The incidence of AEs of volume 
depletion in LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Renal impairment/failure 
Worsening renal function was investigated based on a prespecified list of PTs relating to renal 
impairment and renal failure. There were few AEs of renal impairment and renal failure in the ST 
placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 6 (1.1%), 2 (0.4%), and 0 in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 
10 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Of these 8 AEs, 6 were assessed as mild intensity 
and the remaining 2 were reported as SAEs: 1 was obstructive uropathy (reported as an SAE) and 1 
was acute prerenal failure (reported as an SAE and DAE and resolved following fluid resuscitation). The 
incidence of worsening renal function in LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled 
Phase III pool. There were no events of renal impairment or failure in study D1695C00001 (Part B). 
Fractures 
There were few AEs of fracture in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 8 (1.5%), 6 (1.1%), and 5 
(0.9%) in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The incidence 
of fracture AEs in LT studies was similar to that in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool with 4, 6, 
and 8 events in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
Hypersensitivity 
Potential hypersensitivity events in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool were investigated based 
on a prespecified list of PTs. These AEs occurred in 30 (5.5%), 23 (4.1%), and 19 (3.6%) of subjects 
in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. None of these AEs 
were recorded as SAEs; the majority were mild, skin-related events such as rash, dermatitis, and 
eczema. The incidence of AEs related to hypersensitivity in LT studies was similar to that in the ST 
placebo-controlled Phase III pool.

Laboratory findings 
The section presents data from the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. Clinical laboratory data from 
the ST+LT period of study MB102229 and from study D1695C00001 (Part B) were consistent with the 
ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Marked abnormalities 
Overall, marked abnormalities (MAs) and elevated liver tests were rare in the ST placebo-controlled 
Phase III pool. 
Key findings with regards to the proportions of subjects with MAs of laboratory values (except liver 
tests) in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool are summarised below: 
•  High haematocrit (>0.55 vol) levels were reported in 2.2%, 1.3%, and 0.6% of subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
•  High creatinine (≥1.5 baseline) was reported in 1.5%, 1.8%, and 1.0% of subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
• 
Few subjects had MAs of serum electrolytes, with similar proportions across the treatment 
groups. 
Key findings with regards to the proportions of subjects with elevated liver tests during the ST period 
of the pooled studies are summarised below: 
• 
• 
Elevated liver tests were observed in 3.3%, 3.9%, and 4.5% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 
mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
There were no subjects with ALT or AST >3X ULN and total bilirubin >1.5X ULN within 14 days 
on or after ALT/AST elevation. 
Changes in clinical laboratory evaluations over time 
Overall, there were no meaningful changes in clinical laboratory parameters from baseline to Week 24 
in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, with the exception of urinary glucose which, as expected, 
was increased in the dapagliflozin treatment groups. 
Vital signs and electrocardiograms 
The section presents data from the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. Data from the LT treatment 
period of study MB102229 and from Part B of study D1695C00001 were consistent with the data from 
the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Vital signs 
The mean change from baseline at Week 24 in seated SBP in the pooled studies was -3.8 
mmHg, -2.8 mmHg, and -0.5 mmHg in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo 
groups, respectively. The mean change from baseline at Week 24 in seated DBP was -1.5 mmHg, -1.4 
mmHg, and 0.1 mmHg, respectively. 
A small decrease in mean seated heart rate from baseline to Week 24 was noted in the dapagliflozin 
treatment groups in the pooled studies: -0.3, -0.8, and 1.6 beats per minute in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.

Electrocardiograms 
For most subjects in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, the ECG assessment did not change 
from baseline to Week 24 (LOCF). Proportions of subjects with a change in ECG assessment from 
normal to abnormal and from abnormal to normal were balanced across all treatment groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Age 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool the proportion of subjects with at least 1 AE increased in all 
treatment groups with increased age. In the <35 years age group 65.7%, 65.0%, and 59.9% of 
subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, experienced 
an AE whereas in the ≥50 years group the respective proportions were 72.3%, 70.4%, and 65.8%. 
The overall analysis of AEs by age did not reveal any relevant findings. 
Gender 
There was a larger proportion of AEs in female subjects (71.1%, 72.7%, and 65.5% in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively) than male subjects (68.8%, 
64.1%, and 59.0%, respectively), again primarily driven by AEs in the SOC Infections and infestations 
and genital infections in particular. The overall analysis of AEs by sex did not reveal any relevant 
findings. 
Race 
There was a larger proportion of AEs in Asian subjects across all treatment groups (74.6%, 79.5%, 
and 70.0% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively) than in 
white subjects (69.6%, 67.3%, and 61.7%, respectively). There were too few subjects of other races 
to allow for meaningful comparisons and therefore these data should be interpreted with caution. The 
overall analysis of AEs by race did not reveal any relevant findings. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Dapagliflozin has not been studied in pregnant women or nursing mothers. Pregnancies and breast 
feeding were rare during the T2DM clinical programme and in postmarketing experience. This limited 
experience has not given rise to any safety concerns. 
Pregnant subjects were excluded from participation in the T1DM studies. There were 6 pregnancies 
identified during the ST periods of studies MB102229 and MB102230, of which 3 were in subjects 
treated with dapagliflozin and 3 with placebo, and 2 in the LT period of study MB102229, both in 
subjects treated with dapagliflozin. Study drug was discontinued in the event of pregnancy. 
Table 30 lists the pregnancies reported in subjects treated with dapagliflozin. Subject MB102- 229-
0035-00826 had a premature delivery (Week 36) and the baby was born with respiratory depression, 
poor perfusion, jaundice, ankyloglossia, as well as a clavicle fracture due to birth trauma.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions between dapagliflozin and other drugs or food were addressed in the original dapagliflozin 
T2DM clinical programme. No new information is available on the potential impact on safety of such 
interactions in subjects with T1DM. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 31 is a summary of DAEs by PT for the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. 
Discontinuations due to AEs occurred in 4.2%, 3.5%, and 3.8% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively.

Post marketing experience 
Dapagliflozin was first approved for treatment of patients with T2DM in Australia on 05 October 2012 
and it is currently approved in over 90 countries. The most recent PBRER, with a data lock of 04 
October 2017 and including approximately 2 995 081 patient-years of post-marketing exposure, 
concluded that a comprehensive review of clinical studies and post-marketing experience revealed no 
new information to alter the overall positive benefit-risk profile for dapagliflozin in the approved 
indication (T2DM). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
With this application, information on the safety and tolerability of dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is provided and compared with the known safety profile of dapagliflozin. Data

primarily come from 2 Phase III global studies of dapagliflozin as add-on to insulin therapy in subjects 
with T1DM: studies MB102229 and MB102230. Data from the Phase IIa pilot study, MB102072, and 
from a Japanese Phase I/III study, D1695C00001, are briefly summarised but are generally not 
included in the overall discussion of adverse events (AEs) or clinical laboratory evaluations due to one 
or more of their short duration, small study size, or lack of placebo control. 
The pooling strategy is adequate and acceptable. The selection of AEs of special interest is considered 
relevant based on the knowledge of the safety profile of dapagliflozin in T2DM as well as knowledge of 
the mechanism of action.  The methods of evaluation were adequate. Notably adjudication committees 
were in place for DKA, CV-events and hepatic events. 
The ST-pool provides 24 week data in about 1 000 T1DM patients exposed to dapagliflozin. The extent 
of exposure to randomised study drug is considered adequate to characterise the general safety profile 
of dapagliflozin in T1DM, taking into consideration that the safety profile of dapagliflozin has been well 
characterised in patients with T2DM. The differences in exposure data between treatment groups are 
small. In addition, 52 week data is available for 490 patients in study MB102229 and 457 patients in 
study MB102230. 
In the pooled ST-data set, demographic characteristics were well balanced between treatment groups. 
More patients in the dapagliflozin-treated groups reported AEs (70%, 69% for the 5 mg and 10 mg 
dose respectively) than in the placebo-treated group (62%). The imbalance in AEs between 
dapagliflozin treated groups and placebo is attributable to a higher reporting of AEs related to the 
known safety profile of dapagliflozin, i.e. pollakiuria, thirst, nausea, polyuria, vulvovaginal and genital 
(genital infections only reported for dapagliflozin) mycotic infections. Notably, urinary tract infections 
were reported at a similar rate in all treatment groups. Further analysis of the higher reporting of GI 
events in the dapagliflozin treated groups could not relate these events to developing ketoacidosis. 
Most AEs were of mild intensity; severe AEs were few and reported at a similar rate in all treatment 
groups. AEs considered related to treatment were more than twice as common in the dapagliflozin 
treated      groups compared to placebo (28.6%, 27.0%, and 11.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). There were no apparent differences in the LT 
data compared to the ST data. 
SAEs were reported in 6.8%, 5.5%, and 3.8% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Out of these, 2.7% and 2.1% vs 0.6% were deemed 
as related to treatment in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders and 
were primarily ketone-related. SAEs in SOCs GI, Eye and Renal/Urinary disorders were only reported in 
the dapagliflozin treated groups. Except for metabolic events, most SAEs were few, thus imbalances 
are difficult to interpret. The distribution of SAEs in the pooled T1DM studies was consistent with the 
known safety profile of dapagliflozin, except that there were more ketone-related SAEs in the pooled 
T1DM studies than were observed in T2DM studies. 
There was 1 death, in a placebo-group subject, in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool. The subject 
had previously discontinued study drug and died during the night due to suspected hypoglycaemia. 
Numerically, no difference in the rate of hypoglycaemic events or severe hypoglycaemic events was 
observed between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier plot show no apparent difference in the time to first 
severe hypoglycaemia between groups, with Kaplan-Meier percentages at Week 24 of 7.2%, 7.4%, 
and 7.4% for dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo, respectively. Only 4 subjects, 3 in 
the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 1 in the placebo group, discontinued study drug due to 
Assessment report

Page 92/116 
 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia.       The incidence of hypoglycaemia events decreased over time with Kaplan-Meier 
percentages at Week 52 of 10.7%, 8.9%, and 12.6% respectively. 
The major safety issue with the use of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients is the risk of DKA. In the Art 20 
referral procedure on SGLT2-inhibitors and DKA (EMA/PRAC/50218/2016) the occurrence of DKA in 
predominantly T2DM patients was assessed and the procedure resulted in the introduction of warnings 
and recommendations in the SmPCs for all SGLT2-inhibitors. The data available in the referral could 
not clarify whether there was and actual increase in the risk but rather a different presentation of the 
DKA (euglycaemic DKA) since the background incidence is not known for T2DM. There are however 
plausible theories which indicate that treatment with SGLT2-inhibitors could precipitate DKA through 
its mechanism of action. Therefore, DKA was specifically investigated in the studies and measures 
were taken to reduce the risk. In both studies, patients were repeatedly educated on the symptoms of 
DKA and were provided with blood ketone meters. The patients were also told to record symptoms and 
contact the study site if their self-measured blood ketone reading was ≥0.6 mmol/L. 
In the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, 11 (2.0%), 11 (1.9%) and 3 (0.6%) subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as 
a ‘definite’ DKA event. In 18 of the 25 cases, treatment with insulin and intravenous fluids was 
documented, i.e. the patients would have been treated in hospital. In the ST+LT placebo-controlled 
Phase III pool, 22 (4.0%), 20 (3.5%) and 6 (1.1%) subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as a ‘definite’ DKA event. 
In the ST pool, the incidence rate of DKA was about three times higher in the dapagliflozin treated 
groups (4.55 and 4.36 per 100 PYs) compared to placebo (1.29 per 100 PYs). The incidence rate in the 
placebo-treated group was considerably lower than reported in the literature (5-7% annual rate). In 
the ST+LT data the incidence rate per 100 PY was twice as high as in the ST pool (9.87 and 7.58 per 
100 PYs) and the placebo-treated group showed an incidence rate closer to that reported in the 
literature (4.4 per 100 PYs). The occurrence of ‘definite’ DKA events was evenly distributed over time 
in the ST+LT pool, and no time point could be identified as being of particular risk for the occurrence of 
DKA. There was no major difference between the two doses. 
Well known precipitating factors such as pump failure or missed insulin dose, were equally common in 
all groups (about 30% each). However, in about 30% of cases either no cause could be identified or 
the event was related to “other” causes.  
In addition to the DKA events adjudicated as definite, 31 possible events were identified. The 
distribution between treatment groups was similar to that observed for definite events. 
Analyses made by the MAH could not identify any potential risk factors for DKA that could 
prospectively identify patients at higher risk of DKA when treated with dapagliflozin. However, the 
reduction in insulin dose after addition of dapagliflozin was more pronounced in the patients 
experiencing DKA than in subjects not developing DKA. Thus, a marked reduction in insulin dose after 
addition of dapagliflozin could indicate an increased risk for DKA, and a recommendation to reduce the 
insulin dose with caution (when dose reduction would be needed to prevent hypoglycaemia) has been 
included in the SmPC.  
Factors such as age, diabetes duration, baseline HbA1c, HbA1c prior to the event or change in insulin 
dose prior to the event, were not found to be associated with an increased risk of DKA while on 
dapagliflozin treatment. 
In contrast, for baseline insulin dose there was a clear accumulation of DKA cases in patients receiving 
low insulin doses at baseline. Particularly in the 5 mg dapagliflozin group it became obvious that nearly 
all dapagliflozin cases had an insulin need at baseline below the study population mean (around 0.75 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 93/116 
 
 
 
 
IU/kg); only in two patients with DKA the insulin need was slightly above the population mean. When 
the risk of DKA was analysed by different cut-offs for total insulin dose, the risk difference versus 
placebo was decreased from 2.64% (overall population) to 1.91% when a cut-off of ≥0.6 IU/kg was 
applied. 
A similar phenomenon was observed for BMI: most DKA cases occurred in patients whose BMI was 
below the population mean. This finding is plausible since higher BMI is correlated with insulin 
resistance and hence with higher insulin need. When the risk of DKA was analysed by different cut-offs 
for BMI, the risk difference versus placebo was decreased from 2.64% (overall population) to 1.88% 
when a cut-off of ≥25 kg/m2 was applied.  
It is biologically highly plausible that patients with low insulin need at baseline are vulnerable to DKA. 
Low insulin doses mean that there is virtually no insulin resistance and that the amount of injected 
insulin can be considered essential substitution therapy. Under these circumstances there is little room 
for insulin dose reduction, and any attempts to save insulin by addition of dapagliflozin can lead to 
insulin deficiency which manifests itself as DKA. The SmPC includes recommendations not to use 
dapagliflozin in patients with low insulin need. 
Monitoring of blood ketone levels may be a valuable RMM tool, especially in the presence of other risk 
factors. As a measure to prevent DKA, the MAH employed blood ketone self-measurement. However, 
no actions to be taken were defined in case a high ketone reading was reported by the patient. A 
problem is that it is not known which patients with ketosis actually develop DKA. For precaution, 
actions could be taken in all patients with marked ketosis, e.g. administration of an additional insulin 
dose (together with carbohydrates if needed) and interruption of dapagliflozin treatment. The MAH has 
provided a treatment algorithm which is included in the SmPC and the educational material. This 
algorithm is based on current knowledge on DKA associated with the use of SGLT2i and is deemed 
adequate. 
Genital infection AEs were among the AEs of special interest. Genital infections were more frequent in 
the dapagliflozin treatment groups than the placebo group in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool: 
11.1%, 9.5%, and 2.3% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The overall proportion of subjects with AEs of genital infection was higher in all treatment 
groups than has been previously observed in dapagliflozin studies in subjects with T2DM. However, the 
relative ratio of genital infection in dapagliflozin-treated subjects to those receiving placebo was similar 
to previous dapagliflozin experience in T2DM. 
UTI was most common in the 5 mg dapagliflozin treated group and least common in the 10 mg 
dapagliflozin treated group; 6.8%, 3.7%, and 4.7% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively. As may be expected, UTI was more common in women. There were no 
meaningful differences in the proportions of subjects in each treatment group with AEs of urinary tract 
infection having recurrent events, though more subjects in the dapagliflozin treatment groups received 
antimicrobial treatment and received additional treatment due to inadequate response to the initial 
course, showing that the UTI in the dapagliflozin treated groups were more difficult to treat. There was 
also an overrepresentation of UTI SAEs in the dapagliflozin treated groups (4 events vs none in the 
placebo treated group).  
AEs related to worsening of renal function/renal impairment were only reported in the dapagliflozin 
treated groups (1.1% and 0.4% for 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively). The two SAEs reported appears, 
however, not to have been directly related to treatment. One case of obstructive uropathy may have 
been worsened/precipitated by increased urine volumes. The other case reported prerenal failure and 
was hospitalized due to progressive nausea and vomiting, but the information on the case is limited.

AEs of volume depletion were few and only slightly overrepresented in the dapagliflozin treated group 
(1.5% and 0.5% vs 0.8%). In this context it should be remembered that the mean age in the study 
population was lower than in the T2DM population, thus patients may be less sensitive to volume 
depletion. 
Cardiovascular events were few in the ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool and although the events 
were not evenly distributed, no safety concerns arise. Hepatic events were also few and but evenly 
distributed across treatment groups. There was a slight imbalance in the number of fractures with the 
highest rate reported in the 5 mg dapagliflozin group. The majority of fractures in all treatment groups 
were foot/ankle fractures. There was a slight imbalance in the number of events due to potential 
hypersensitivity with the highest rate reported in the 5 mg dapagliflozin group. The majority of events 
were mild and skin-related. High haematocrit and high creatinine was reported at a higher rate in 
dapagliflozin treated patients compared to placebo, in line with the mechanism of action of 
dapagliflozin and with previous observations in patients with T2DM. There was no difference in the 
reporting rate of elevated liver tests between active treatment and placebo and no patient showed a 
concomitant increase in ALT or AST and total bilirubin within 14 days on or after ALT/AST elevation. 
There were no meaningful changes in clinical laboratory parameters from baseline to Week 24 in the 
ST placebo-controlled Phase III pool, with the exception of urinary glucose. This is consistent with the 
known safety profile of dapagliflozin. 
A decrease in both SBP (-3.8 mmHg, -2.8 mmHg, and -0.5 mmHg in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively) and DBP (-1.5 mmHg, -1.4 mmHg, and 0.1 
mmHg, respectively) was observed in the dapagliflozin treated groups, whereas the blood pressure 
remained unchanged in the placebo treated group. There was also a small decrease in mean seated 
heart rate, less than 1 beat per minute, in the dapagliflozin treated groups, while the heart rate 
increased slightly in the placebo treated group. There were no relevant changes in the ECG 
assessment.  
The mean age in the study population was lower than in previous studies with T2DM patients. The age 
of the patients included ranged from 18 to 75 years, and only 5% of subjects were older than 65 
years. In spite of this, the duration of disease ranged from 0 to 66 years. When using an age cut-off of 
≥50 years, a higher reporting of AEs was observed compared to patients <35 years age. This increase 
was balanced between all treatment groups and possibly reflects a higher co-morbidity/vulnerability in 
the older age group. AEs were more common reported by female patients than by male patients. This 
was mainly driven by a higher reporting of genital infections. Notably the pattern was comparable for 
all treatment groups. Across treatment groups, there was a higher reporting of AEs in Asian patients 
compared to white patients. 
Pregnancies have been rare in the T2DM population, possibly due to the age distribution in this 
population. Notably 6 pregnancies were identified in the T1DM program. The outcome is not known in 
2 of the cases. In one case, an unhealthy baby was born; however, the description of the condition is 
compatible with the complications known to occur in babies born to diabetic mothers. In 2 of the cases 
the pregnancy was either terminated early or resulted in a spontaneous abortion. Should the use of 
dapagliflozin be approved for the T1DM population, there will probably be an increased risk of exposure 
during pregnancies. The SmPC however includes adequate information, and dapagliflozin is not 
recommended for use in the second and third trimester based on non-clinical findings. 
No new data regarding interactions have been provided. This is acceptable since the T1DM and T2DM 
are not considered different in this respect. Thus, the data concerning interactions in T2DM subjects 
may be extrapolated to the T1DM population.

Discontinuations due to AEs were evenly distributed between groups (4.2% and 3.5% vs 3.8), whereas 
SAEs leading to discontinuations were twice as common in the 5 mg group (2.7%) compared to both 
the 10 mg group (1.2%) and placebo (1.1%). DKA was the most common cause for discontinuation in 
the study with 8 events in the 5 mg dapagliflozin treated group and 3 events in both the 10 mg 
dapagliflozin treated group and in the placebo group.  In addition, 5 patients in the dapagliflozin 
treated groups discontinued due to ketoacidosis/ketosis (none in the placebo group). Discontinuations 
due to genital or urinary tract infections were only observed in the dapagliflozin treated groups (5 
patients). Not different in the ST+LT data. 
Post-marketing experience in T2DM patients is by now rather extensive with almost 3 million PYs of 
exposure. The safety profile in this population is well known. 
Report from the Ad Hoc expert Group (AHEG) meeting held on 21 November 2018 
CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field of endocrinology 
and diabetology, as well as from patient representatives, on the issues of clinical relevance of observed 
treatment effects, risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and a potential target population of patients with 
T1DM that could benefit from treatment with dapagliflozin. Questions were addressed to the ad hoc 
expert group. The corresponding answers are presented below: 
Question 1 
What is the AHEG opinion on the clinical relevance of the treatment effects observed with 
dapagliflozin, esp. with regard to reduction of HbA1c, insulin doses, body weight and 
glucose variability? 
Efficacy outcomes from studies MB102229 and MB102230 were presented to the experts. With regard 
to individual aspects they had the following view: 
The absolute reductions of HbA1c in the treatment groups by 0.36 to 0.48 % (mean absolute change 
from baseline) were seen as positive and by several experts also as clinical relevant, although the 
majority of the experts with unrestricted participation considered the reduction only of borderline 
clinical relevance.  
The experts did not see an obvious benefit in the observed reduction of the average insulin doses (both 
basal and post prandial); one expert pointed out that insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) is a hormone replacement therapy, therefore, conceptually, a lowering of the insulin 
dose may not be a goal at all (at least in non-overweight patients). 
The reduction of body weight by 3.00 to 3.65% (mean absolute percent change from baseline) was 
considered of minor benefit, but nevertheless was considered to be beneficial for some patients, 
according to some of the experts. 
The studies also demonstrated a reduction of the variability of plasma glucose. This was seen by the 
experts in general as a relevant goal, in particular as it did not result in an increase of hypoglycaemic 
events. The company was asked whether benefits of a reduction in glucose variability were reflected by 
improvements of patient reported outcomes, which was not the case (no data to support this), 
however it was acknowledged by the experts that this might be difficult to capture. Another benefit, 
mentioned by patients, is that such an improvement helps to simplify insulin dose calculations.  
The AHEG had a split view whether the totality of the efficacy outcomes demonstrated in studies 
MB102229 and MB102230 would represent a clinically important benefit overall for patients with T1DM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 96/116 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of the experts with unrestricted participation were of the view that this add-on treatment 
may provide only a small benefit.  
Considering this to be a potentially lifelong treatment for T1DM, some experts and patients suggested 
the need for the generation of more data with long-term treatment, such as renal outcomes, and 
safety outcomes in general. 
Question 2  
The risk of DKA was considerably higher in the dapagliflozin treated groups compared to 
placebo despite careful information to patients and monitoring including measurements of 
ketones. 
a.  Please discuss the acceptability of this risk in clinical practice 
All experts agreed that DKA represents a substantial and important risk. The experts also noted that 
the incidence of DKA in the real world is considerably higher than the incidence seen in the control 
group of the studies, presumably due to the measures implemented during the trial to mitigate this 
risk. Nevertheless, the experts noted that cases of DKA where reported with similar frequency at all 
time points during the studies.  
The experts stated that education and awareness of the problem, including the occurrence of DKA with 
only slightly elevated plasma glucose levels, is of foremost importance to reduce the risk. 
The AHEG had split views on the acceptability of this risk. A majority of experts considered that the 
risk might be manageable in a restricted subpopulation (in particular in patients well trained and well-
educated in treatment of T1DM). The majority of experts with unrestricted participation were of the 
opinion that the expected extent of DKA could constitute an unacceptable risk in clinical practice.  
The risk of DKA with the use of dapagliflozin maybe different in different health care systems as, 
according to experts, once available, the product could be expected to be prescribed also by less well-
trained generalists in some member states. 
b.  Risk minimisation measures such as a guide for health care professionals and 
patients, as well as a Patient Alert Card have been proposed in order to mitigate the 
risks. What is the AHEG view on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the 
proposed measures in clinical practice? 
The experts, including the 2 patients, raised some concerns with regard to the suitability of the 
proposed materials for a broad spectrum of health care professionals and patients, intended to 
mitigate the risk of DKA: Some experts found that the material for doctors might not be very user 
friendly, would be demanding (e.g. to “establish a personal action plan” for the patient etc.), and may 
not address sufficiently risks such as patients not complying with ketone testing or the situation of 
insulin pump users. Patients felt it would put quite a high responsibility on them, and may, to some 
degree, over-burden them.  
c.  Please discuss any additional potential measures that could be introduced to 
decrease the risk of DKA. 
As the product information recommends that patients should be able to monitor blood ketone levels 
themselves, ketone measurements were discussed extensively. It was acknowledged that ketone 
measurements by patients could represent an important contribution to the safe use of the product. It 
was pointed out, however, that this was not easily available in some member states, and even if this 
was the case, whether this was practical to measure on a frequent base and would achieve high 
acceptance by patients was questioned. Also, experience with this seems to indicate that slight 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 97/116 
 
 
 
 
increases for various causes (e.g. diet) may cause frequent follow-ups by health care professionals. 
From the patients’ perspective the acceptance of another frequently to be self-measured laboratory 
parameter beyond glucose was questioned.  
The AHEG emphasized that general awareness and education of DKA (in particular also euglycaemic 
DKA), both with patients and health care professionals, is of high importance to reduce the risk. There 
was also the unanimous view that to mitigate the risk treatment and prescription of this therapy 
should be exclusively by specialists. 
The experts had no further proposals for risk mitigation. 
Question 3 
Please discuss which patients, if any, with T1DM could relevantly benefit from treatment 
with dapagliflozin, i.e. what could be a potential target population in clinical practice? Could 
restrictions with respect to BMI and insulin requirements be of relevance? 
The experts found any benefit in patients with T1DM could be expected to be most relevant in patients 
who are overweight, who are well educated and trained in T1DM, and who have large glucose 
variability. While it was acknowledged that the risk of DKA seemingly is higher in patients treated with 
insulin pump therapy, it was also said that those patients may particularly benefit as often suffering 
from high glucose variability in the first place, and in any case represent an increasing and important 
proportion of the T1DM population.  
The experts were asked to discuss possible parameters indicative of an improved benefit/risk ratio. The 
total daily insulin dose as one possible parameter was discussed. While it was acknowledged that 
patients with low insulin requirements may be of somewhat increased risk of DKA, the experts were 
sceptical of a specific cut off value for treatment (e.g. to treat only patients with a total daily insulin 
dose > 0.6 IU/kg), as under some circumstances even patients with low insulin requirements may 
benefit, a cut off value would be very difficult to define based on available data, and because insulin 
requirements may be the consequence of other underlying circumstances which should be taken into 
account. The experts thought that a low HbA1c value should not constitute an exclusion criterion per 
se, but that highly elevated HbA1c should, also considering that the latter may reflect a low degree of 
patient compliance. The experts also thought that body weight could be a relevant parameter, as the 
safety profile would improve with a higher BMI. One expert emphasized the importance of C-peptide 
levels, as an important marker of residual beta-cell function relevant for definition of the most 
appropriate target population to define an indication.  
The experts agreed that the general T1DM population is in any case a too broad target population. 
They further agreed that proper patient education and compliance is very essential and, if approved for 
T1DM, the product should exclusively be prescribed in specialist centres, or at least by specialists, i.e. 
diabetologists or endocrinologists.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The general safety profile of dapagliflozin when used in patients with T1DM does not differ when 
compared to what is known from the use of dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM. However, treatment 
with dapagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of DKA in spite of repeated education of the 
patients and monitoring of ketones. There was no apparent difference in the risk by dose of 
dapagliflozin and the DKA events increase steadily over time, suggesting that DKA risk is not limited 
e.g. to treatment initiation but unrelievedly present throughout SGLT2 therapy. Considering that DKA 
Assessment report

Page 98/116 
 
 
 
 
is a serious condition, additional measures to minimise this risk are considered necessary and warnings 
and recommendations have been included in the SmPC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
Based on the inclusion of a new population (T1DM) at a higher risk of DKA in the indication, the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for dapagliflozin needs to be amended 
as follows: The frequency of PSUR submission should be revised to 6 months. The next PSUR should 
cover the period from 05 October 2018 to 04 October 2019 and be submitted within 70 days of the 
data lock point. The following PSUR should cover the period from 05 October 2019 to 04 April 2020 
and be submitted within 70 days of the data lock point in accordance with the updated list of Union 
reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
3.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 16 and subsequent versions up to 16.7 within this 
procedure. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 16.7 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 16.7 with the following content:

4.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated to include 
information on the use of dapagliflozin in T1DM. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all proposed changes to the Product Information (SmPC, 
Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet (changes highlighted) of Forxiga 5mg film-coated tablet, as a 
relevant example with changes highlighted as adopted by the CHMP on 31 January 2019).  
4.1.1.  User consultation 
The WSA has submitted the results of a user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet that meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label 
and package leaflet of medicinal products for human. The user test report is considered acceptable. For 
detailed evaluation, see appendix 3. 
5.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
5.1.  Therapeutic Context 
5.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The current application seeks to extend the indication of dapagliflozin to also include treatment of 
patients with T1DM: 
“Forxiga / Edistride is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled

• 
type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise

type 1 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 , when 
insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin 
therapy. 
For clinical trial results with respect to populations studied, effects on glycaemic control and 
combinations with other medicinal products see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 104/116 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In patients with T1DM, SGLT2 inhibition by dapagliflozin is expected to produce glucose-lowering 
effects, as well as modest reductions in body weight, blood pressure, and, potentially, glycaemic 
variability, as the amount of glucose excreted following dapagliflozin treatment is dependent on the 
plasma glucose concentration and independent of insulin. 
5.1.2.    Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with T1DM require lifelong insulin therapy due to their inability to produce enough endogenous 
insulin. However, a large proportion of the T1DM population is unable to achieve recommended 
glycaemic levels with insulin alone. 
There are currently no approved adjunct treatments to insulin for patients with T1DM in the EU. 
While insulin treatment is lifesaving in patients with T1DM, many patients suffer from hypoglycaemic 
events as a result of the treatment, which negatively impact their daily lives and can, conversely, be 
life-threatening. Unwanted increase of body weight may also be a problem when insulin doses are 
increased. The glycaemic variability associated with insulin treatment also negatively impacts patients’ 
quality of life. Reducing swings in glucose levels is therefore of importance to prevent insulin-induced 
hypoglycaemia/hyperglycaemia as well as to improve the quality of life in patients with T1DM. Another 
risk associated with suboptimal insulin use is DKA. 
5.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two key Phase III efficacy studies were included in the dapagliflozin T1DM development programme: 
studies MB102229 and MB102230. 
Both studies were multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase III 
studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg when added to ongoing 
insulin therapy in subjects with T1DM. The studies included an 8-week lead-in period, a 24-week short-
term (ST) treatment period, and a 28-week long-term (LT) extension (LT extension ongoing for study 
MB102230). The primary and secondary efficacy analyses are based on the 24-week results, with 
selected analyses repeated for the 52-week results as exploratory analyses of LT efficacy. The safety 
analyses are based on the 24-week and 52-week results.   
The target population was subjects with T1DM aged ≥18 to ≤75 years who were on ongoing insulin 
treatment for at least 12 months and who had inadequate glycaemic control, with central laboratory 
HbA1c at the Week -1 visit of ≥7.5% to ≤10.5%. 
In total, 1591 patients were randomised 1:1:1 and included in the primary analysis. The ST-pool from 
these studies provides 24 week safety data in about 1 000 T1DM patients exposed to dapagliflozin. In 
addition, 52 week safety data is available for 490 patients in study MB102229 and 457 patients in 
study MB102230. 
5.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary efficacy variable was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24. In study MB102229, the 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 was -0.42% (95% 
CI: -0.56, -0.28; p<0.0001) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -0.45% (95% CI: -0.58, -0.31; p<0.0001) for 
dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study MB102230, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in HbA1c 
from baseline to Week 24 was -0.37% (95% CI: -0.49, -0.26; <0.0001) for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -
0.42% (95% CI: - 0.53, -0.30; <0.0001) for dapagliflozin 10 mg. This was supported by a significant 
Assessment report

decrease in the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in 24-hour CGM values from baseline to 
Week 24 in both studies. 
In both studies, most of the reduction in HbA1c in the dapagliflozin treatment groups occurred over the 
first 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained for the duration of the ST treatment period.  
The percent change in total daily insulin dose was a secondary endpoint. In study MB102229, the 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in total daily insulin dose from baseline to Week 24 
was -8.80% for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -13.17% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study MB102230, the 
adjusted mean change compared with placebo in total daily insulin dose from baseline to Week 24 was 
-10.78% for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -11.08% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In general, the proportional 
reductions seen for basal and bolus insulin individually were similar to the proportional reduction in 
total insulin, thus both basal and bolus insulin were reduced to the same extent.  
In study MB102229, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline 
to Week 24 was -3.05% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and -3.72% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study 
MB102230, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in body weight from baseline to Week 
24 was -3.21% for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -3.74% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
The effect on blood glucose variability was investigated by two secondary endpoint, 1) change in mean 
value of 24-hour glucose readings (MAGE) and 2) change in percentage of 24-hour glucose readings 
falling within the range of >70 mg/dL to ≤180 mg/dL. 
In study MB102229, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo inMAGE from baseline to Week 
24 was -17.30 mg/dL in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group and -18.93 mg/dL for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In 
study MB102230, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in MAGE from baseline to Week 
24 was -9.85 mg/dL for dapagliflozin 5 mg and -9.36 mg/dL for dapagliflozin 10 mg. 
In study MB102229, the adjusted mean change compared with placebo in the percentage of glucose 
readings falling between >70 mg/dL and ≤180 mg/dL from baseline to Week 24 was 9.11% in the 
dapagliflozin 5 mg group and 10.65% for dapagliflozin 10 mg. In study MB102230, the adjusted mean 
change compared with placebo in the percentage of glucose readings falling between >70 mg/dL and 
≤180 mg/dL from baseline to Week 24 was 9.02% for dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10.70% for dapagliflozin 
10 mg. 
In study MB102229, the proportions of subjects experiencing a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without 
severe hypoglycaemia events were 49.6% and 50.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, 
respectively, compared with 25.3% in the placebo group. In study MB102230, the proportions of 
subjects experiencing a ≥0.5% reduction in HbA1c without severe hypoglycaemia events were 39.5% 
and 41.6% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 20.1% in the 
placebo group. 
A decrease in both SBP (-3.8 mmHg and 2.8 mmHg) and DBP (-1.5 mmHg and -1.4 mmHg) was 
observed in the dapagliflozin treated groups, whereas the blood pressure remained unchanged in the 
placebo treated group. 
Subgroups analyses showed consistent outcomes in all subgroups with regards to the primary 
endpoint. 
Long-term treatment up to 52 weeks shows a slight attenuation of the effect on HbA1c compared to 
the outcome at week 24, whereas the effect on body weight is maintained. The findings in both Phase 
III studies were consistent.

Since there were only marginal differences in efficacy between the two doses, only the lower dose of 
5 mg is acceptable as a precautionary measure. 
5.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The outcome of the two Phase III studies showed consistent results and there are no important 
uncertainties with regards to the favourable effects.   
Regarding the potential mechanisms by which dapagliflozin might improve glycaemic control, it can be 
assumed that the SGLT2 inhibitor blunts the post-prandial glucose excursion since a higher blood 
glucose level will lead to a higher glucose excretion. However, a clear effect of dapagliflozin on 
postprandial blood glucose was not observed, which suggests that dapagliflozin does not exert an 
additional effect to prandial insulin. Instead, dapagliflozin on top of insulin lead to markedly decreased 
blood glucose levels during the night, especially in the early morning hours. Therefore, dapagliflozin 
may counteract the so-called “dawn-phenomenon”. 
Data from the DCCT trial has shown that a decrease in HbA1c is correlated with a decrease in mortality 
in patients with T1DM. However, the long-term effect of stabilised blood glucose levels is less well 
documented, thus the clinical significance of the decrease in the glucose variability observed in the 
studies is uncertain. 
5.4.  Unfavourable effects 
More patients in the dapagliflozin-treated groups reported AEs (70%, 69% for the 5 mg and 10 mg 
dose respectively) than in the placebo-treated group (62%). The imbalance in AEs between 
dapagliflozin treated groups and placebo is attributable to a higher reporting of AEs related to the 
known safety profile of dapagliflozin, i.e. pollakiuria, thirst, nausea, polyuria, vulvovaginal and genital 
mycotic infections. 
SAEs were reported in 6.8%, 5.5%, and 3.8% of subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg, and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Out of these, 2.7% and 2.1% vs 0.6% were deemed 
as related to treatment in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The distribution of SAEs in the pooled T1DM studies was consistent with the known safety 
profile of dapagliflozin, except that there were more ketone-related SAEs in the pooled T1DM studies 
than were observed in T2DM studies. 
Genital infections were more frequent in the dapagliflozin treatment groups than the placebo group: 
11.1%, 9.5%, and 2.3% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, 
respectively. The overall proportion of subjects with AEs of genital infection was higher in all treatment 
groups than has been previously observed in dapagliflozin studies in subjects with T2DM. However, the 
relative ratio of genital infection in dapagliflozin-treated subjects to those receiving placebo was similar 
to previous dapagliflozin experience in T2DM. 
UTI was most common in the 5 mg dapagliflozin treated group and least common in the 10 mg 
dapagliflozin treated group; 6.8%, 3.7%, and 4.7% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively. As may be expected, UTI was more common in women. There was an 
overrepresentation of UTI SAEs in the dapagliflozin treated groups (4 events vs none in the placebo 
treated group). 
AEs related to worsening of renal function/renal impairment were only reported in the dapagliflozin 
treated groups (1.1% and 0.4% for 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 107/116 
 
 
 
 
Numerically, no difference in the rate of hypoglycaemic events or severe hypoglycaemic events was 
observed between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier plot show no apparent difference in the time to first 
severe hypoglycaemia between groups, with Kaplan-Meier percentages at Week 24 of 7.2%, 7.4%, 
and 7.4% for dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo, respectively. The incidence of 
hypoglycaemia events decreased over time with Kaplan-Meier percentages at Week 52 of 10.7%, 
8.9%, and 12.6% respectively. 
Other AEs of special interest such as cardiovascular events, hepatic events, volume depletion, 
fractures and events due to potential hypersensitivity were few and although there were some 
imbalances, no new safety concerns arise from these data. High haematocrit and high creatinine was 
reported at a higher rate in dapagliflozin treated patients compared to placebo, in line with the 
mechanism of action of dapagliflozin and with previous observations in patients with T2DM. 
Most AEs were of mild intensity; severe AEs were few and reported at a similar rate in all treatment 
groups. AEs considered related to treatment were more than twice as common in the dapagliflozin 
treated      groups compared to placebo (28.6%, 27.0%, and 11.8% in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). There were no apparent differences in the LT 
data compared to the ST data. 
The major safety issue with the use of dapagliflozin in T1DM patients is the risk of  diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA). In the Art 20 referral procedure on SGLT2-inhibitors and DKA 
(EMA/PRAC/50218/2016) the occurrence of DKA in predominantly T2DM patients was assessed and the 
procedure resulted in the introduction of warnings and recommendations in the SmPCs for all SGLT2-
inhibitors. DKA was specifically investigated in the studies and measures were taken to reduce the risk.  
In the short term pooled data, 11 (2.0%), 11 (1.9%) and 3 (0.6%) subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 
dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had an event adjudicated as a ‘definite’ DKA 
event. In the short term+long term placebo-controlled Phase III pool, 22 (4.0%), 20 (3.5%) and 6 
(1.1%) subjects in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and placebo groups, respectively, had 
an event adjudicated as a ‘definite’ DKA event. 
The occurrence of ‘definite’ DKA events was evenly distributed over time in the ST+LT pool, and no 
time point could be identified as being of particular risk for the occurrence of DKA. There was no major 
difference between the two doses. 
Well known precipitating factors such as pump failure or missed insulin dose, were equally common in 
all groups (about 30% each). However, in about 30% of cases either no cause could be identified, or 
the event was related to “other” causes.  
Attempts have been made to identify patients with an increased risk of DKA. However, the reliability of 
those analyses is questioned due to few events. There was however a higher number of DKA cases in 
patients receiving low insulin doses at baseline. When the risk of DKA was analysed by different cut-
offs for total insulin dose, the risk difference versus placebo was decreased from 2.9% (overall pooled 
phase 3 population receiving 5 mg dapagliflozin) to 1.6% when a cut-off of ≥0.6 IU/kg was applied in 
this population. A similar phenomenon was observed for BMI: most DKA cases occurred in patients 
whose BMI was below the population mean. When the risk of DKA was analysed by different cut-offs 
for BMI, the risk difference versus placebo was decreased from 2.9% (overall population) to 0.7% 
when a cut-off of ≥27 kg/m2 was applied. However, all subgroup analyses concerning risk of DKA 
should be interpreted with caution due to low number of events.

5.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with an increased risk of DKA in spite of repeated 
education of the patients and monitoring of ketones. 
Despite confirmation of ketosis in the study, development of ketoacidosis obviously could not always 
be prevented. The SmPC now includes detailed warnings and recommendations and additional risk 
minimisation measures will be provided in the form of an educational material. Compared to the 
clinical studies, risk minimisation measures have been strengthened. Therefore, a post-approval safety 
study will be conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures taken. 
The mean age in the study population was lower than in previous studies with T2DM patients. The age 
of the patients included ranged from 18 to 75 years, and only 5% of subjects were older than 65 
years. In spite of this, the duration of disease ranged from 0 to 66 years. When using an age cut-off of 
≥50 years, a higher reporting of AEs was observed compared to patients <35 years age. AEs were 
more commonly reported by female patients than by male patients. This was mainly driven by a higher 
reporting of genital infections. Notably the pattern was comparable for all treatment groups.  
Pregnancies have been rare in the T2DM population, possibly due to the age distribution in this 
population. Notably 6 pregnancies were identified in the T1DM program. The SmPC includes adequate 
warnings.

5.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
5.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
T1DM is characterised by insulin deficiency due to destruction of the insulin-producing cells. Insulin 
treatment aims at normalising blood glucose levels in order to avoid acute symptoms of 
hyperglycaemia and to minimise the risk of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. 
Optimal treatment requires that the patient monitors blood glucose levels and make insulin dose 
adjustments on a daily basis. Thus, the management of T1DM has a large impact on the patient’s daily 
life. Currently only insulin is approved for the treatment of T1DM in the EU. In spite of improvements 
in insulins, methods of administration and monitoring of blood glucose, normalisation of glucose levels 
is difficult, and the treatment is associated with hypo- and hyperglycaemia as well as weight increase. 
Thus, there is a need for new therapies as an adjunct to insulin therapy, in order to alleviate the 
negative effects of insulin treatment in order to reach treatment targets. However, it should be 
acknowledged that treatment of T1DM carries an inherent risk of DKA since interruption of treatment 
or an excessive increase in insulin need will result in the development of DKA. 
The data provided with this application show that dapagliflozin, when added to optimised insulin 
therapy, results in a moderate decrease in HbA1c without a subsequent increase in the risk of 
hypoglycaemias compared to placebo. In addition, decrease of body weight and blood pressure was 
documented and blood glucose measurements were less variable. Previous knowledge from the DCCT 
trial show that a decrease in HbA1c has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality, whereas the 
long-term benefits of stabilisation of blood glucose are less well documented.  
The general safety profile of dapagliflozin is well known and most of these issues such as urogenital 
infections are easily identified and can be handled. The safety profile is not different in the T1DM 
population compared to the T2DM population with one important exception which is the increased risk 
of DKA observed in the studies.

In 2015, an Art 20 referral procedure on SGLT2-inhibitors and DKA (EMA/PRAC/50218/2016) was 
initiated due to an increased reporting of DKA in T2DM patients. At the time of the procedure data was 
not sufficient to conclude whether SGLT2-inhibitors increased the risk of DKA. However, based on the 
knowledge about the pharmacodynamic effect of SGLT2-inhibition, it is plausible that treatment with 
SGLT2-inhibitors could promote DKA development.  
The data presented with this application did indeed show that, in spite of the precautionary measures 
taken, there was a considerable increase in the risk of DKA compared to placebo in T1DM patients. 
This lends support to a direct promoting effect of dapagliflozin on the development of DKA. The 
increased risk is of concern, taking into consideration that DKA is a condition which is potentially life-
threatening. 
The CHMP has taken the position that the benefit risk balance is negative when considering  the total 
study population (type 1 diabetes mellitus,which would also include lean and slightly overweight 
patients),  as well as when considering T1D patients with a BMI above 25 (proposal for a restricted 
target population as presented during the oral explanation). Therefore, the MAH made further efforts 
to identify a subgroup with a potentially positive benefit/risk balance based on the results from the 
pivotal studies. However, it should be emphasized that general knowledge about the pathophysiology 
of the disease and DKA by the patient are also of relevance in such an exercise. The subsequently 
proposed target population consisted of patients with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 and total daily insulin dose ≥0.7 
IU/kg. This subgroup constitutes almost 30% of the overall study population (145/548). 
The main benefit of treatment with dapagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes is a combined effect 
on glycaemic control, weight reduction and effects on blood pressure. One additional benefit that was 
emphasised by some members of the ad hoc expert group was the reduced glucose variability. Based 
on study data, the benefits of treatment in the proposed target population seem to be rather similar to 
the total population. However, the unmet need in patients with high overweight/obesity is very 
different compared to patients with normal weight considering that the alternative treatment, i.e. 
increase of insulin dose, will lead to additional weight gain which subsequently may increase the risk of 
cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the expected benefit is higher in the  target population (overweight 
or obese) compared to the total type 1 diabetes population. 
Since no remarkable gain in efficacy parameters was observed with the 10mg daily administration, 
only the 5mg strength is granted approval for use in type1 diabetes ; the recommended dose in this 
indication is 5mg once daily. 
When considering the risk of DKA, the incidence rate in the proposed target population  with BMI ≥27 
kg/m2 and total daily insulin dose ≥0.7 IU/kg was comparable to the corresponding subgroup on 
placebo treatment. Since this population is rather limited and the DKA events are few, these analyses 
are uncertain. In addition, the CHMP was concerned that the inclusion of total daily insulin (IU) in the 
indication could create confusion, since patient´s insulin doses may change, sometimes on a daily 
basis. Finally, during the January CHMP discussion, the indication wording was agreed as follows: 
“Forxiga / Edistride is indicated in adults for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 1 diabetes 
mellitus as an adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2, when insulin alone does not provide 
adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy”. However, since there are indications that 
a low insulin dose indeed may increase the risk of DKA, this information is included in the warning 
section of the SmPC. 
The MAH has proposed a comprehensive risk minimisation plan which includes the provision of 
additional risk minimisation measures (educational materials) as such: healthcare professionals guide 
including a prescriber’s guide, patient’s/carer’s guide and a patient alert card. The objectives of these 
additional risk minimisation measures are: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213138/2019  
Page 111/116 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
to provide healthcare professionals with specific guidance on the signs, symptoms, risks and 
treatment of DKA including events with atypical presentation in patients prescribed 
dapagliflozin for type 1 diabetes.  
To provide specific guidance to patients/carers being prescribed dapagliflozin for type 1 
diabetes on the signs, symptoms and risks of DKA including events with atypical presentation.  
The Patient Alert Card, which the patients will be carried at all times, will ensure that patients/carer 
hold at all times information about dapagliflozin and the signs, symptoms and risk of DKA. The 
information can be made available to relevant healthcare professionals (e.g., emergency room 
physicians) when needed.  
Moreover, in order to estimate the incidence of DKA in T1DM dapagliflozin users following 
implementation of risk minimisation measures in Europe and assess their effectiveness, the MAH will 
conduct and submit the results from an imposed category 1 observational cohort study using existing 
data sources in European countries where dapagliflozin will be launched for T1DM. 
To minimise the risk of DKA, dapagliflozin use will be restricted for initiation and supervision by 
specialists in type 1 diabetes only, and   it is of outmost importance that only motivated and educated 
type 1 diabetes patients are identified for treatment with dapagliflozin. In addition to being 
overweight/obese and having an inadequate glycaemic control, the patient should be able and 
committed to monitor their ketones levels and have a close contact with a specialist doctor or nurse. 
Patients should be educated on how to recognise DKA risk factors, signs or symptoms, and how and 
when to monitor ketone levels and what actions to take when elevated ketone readings occur. As such 
an educational session by the specialist in type 1 diabetes with the patient will take place prior 
initiation of treatment, in which the educational materials will be given to patients. It will also be 
important that insulin dose reduction during treatment should only be done when needed to prevent 
hypoglycaemia and should be done cautiously to avoid ketosis and DKA. Marked reductions of insulin 
should be avoided; when necessary, this should prompt discontinuation of dapagliflozin. It should be 
noted that overall these actions are more stringent than the risk minimisation measures that were 
used in the pivotal studies submitted for this application.  
Thus, dapagliflozin will be a treatment alternative only for a limited number of patients with type 1 
diabetes, but in some patients, e.g. those with substantial problems with glucose variability and for 
those where an increase of the insulin dose would not be appropriate, it would be a valuable addition 
to insulin treatment. 
5.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance of Forxiga/Edistride in the proposed indication “ type 1 diabetes mellitus as an 
adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 , when insulin alone does not provide adequate 
glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy”, is considered as positive since the benefits are 
considered to outweigh the risks. 
5.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
An AHEG meeting was held on 21 November 2018. The discussions from this meeting are present in 
the section 2.5.1 of this report.

type 1 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to insulin in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2, when insulin alone 
does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimal insulin therapy, in each Member State, 
the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational 
materials, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the 
programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The educational materials are aimed at providing guidance on how to manage risk of diabetic 
ketoacidosis (DKA) in patients with type 1 diabetes. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where dapagliflozin is marketed for type 1 diabetes, 
all healthcare professionals and patients/carers who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use the 
product have access to: 
•         Guide for Health Care Professionals including a prescriber’s checklist 
•         Patient’s/Carer’s Guide 
•         Patient Alert Card 
The guide for healthcare professionals including the prescriber’s checklist should contain the following 
key elements: 
•         Dapagliflozin is not a substitute for insulin (and does not alter insulin-sensitivity). 
•         The risk of DKA is increased with dapagliflozin treatment.

•         If treated with dapagliflozin, glucose levels will not adequately reflect insulin needs, and DKA may 
occur in patients treated with dapagliflozin even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/l (250 
mg/dl). Therefore, glucose monitoring must be supplemented by ketone monitoring.  
•        Patients with euglycaemic DKA may need glucose in addition to standard of care treatment for DKA 
and dapagliflozin should be discontinued if DKA occurs. 
•        Guidance to the physician for assessing whether the patient is eligible for dapagliflozin 
prescription, e.g. patient selection criteria including adherence to insulin treatment and insulin 
thresholds, patient’s beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) < 0.6 mmol/L or urine ketones < 1+, BMI ≥ 27 
kg/m2, absence of DKA risk factors. 
•         Guidance to the physician for assessing whether the patient is prepared and engaged to perform 
self-ketone testing before and during therapy. 
•        Summary of the recommendations for patients, particularly regarding blood ketone measurement 
and managing sick days.  
•         For pump users: restrict dapagliflozin prescription to patients experienced in pump use, common 
trouble-shooting strategies when interruptions of insulin delivery via pump occur in case of pump 
failure. 
•         Counsel the patient and evaluate their adherence to ketone monitoring while establishing their 
baseline ketone level 1 to 2 weeks before treatment initiation and ensure the patient: 
o  Has received education/training in ketone testing, and interpreting/acting upon test results 
o 
o 
Is willing/able to perform ketone testing as prescribed 
Is adequately informed about managing sick days 
•         Ensure the patient is on optimal insulin therapy prior to initiation of dapagliflozin treatment. 
•         Dapagliflozin treatment should be temporarily stopped before surgical procedures or in case of 
hospitalisation for acute serious illness. 
•         If addition of dapagliflozin leads to marked reduction of insulin need, discontinuation of 
dapagliflozin should be considered to avoid high risk of DKA. 
The patient’s/carer’s guide should contain the following key elements: 
•         Dapagliflozin is not a substitute for insulin 
•         DKA may occur in patients treated with dapagliflozin even if blood glucose levels are below 14 
mmol/l (250 mg/dl), i.e. an explanation of the concept of euglycaemic DKA 
•        Signs/symptoms of DKA - if not adequately managed DKA can be severe and fatal.  
•         How to measure ketones, how to interpret the results and what to do in case of 
hyperketonaemia/DKA (contact HCP immediately if BHB > 0.6 mmol/L with symptoms or if BHB > 
1.5 mmol/L with or without symptoms) 
•         Insulin dose reduction during treatment should only be done when needed to prevent 
hypoglycaemia and should be done cautiously to avoid ketosis and DKA 
•         Do not start caloric restriction or carbohydrate restriction while treated 
The patient alert card should contain the following key elements: 
•         The Patient Alert Card should be presented to any HCP consulted. 
•         DKA may occur in patients treated with dapagliflozin even if blood glucose levels are below 14 
mmol/l (250 mg/dl). 
•         Signs/symptoms of DKA. 
•         Patients with euglycaemic DKA should receive glucose, insulin and fluids for DKA, dapagliflozin 
should be discontinued. 
•         Dapagliflozin should be temporarily stopped before surgical procedures or hospitalisation for acute 
serious illness. 
•         Contact details of the dapagliflozin prescriber’ and ‘Name of patient’. 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures:

dapagliflozin users following implementation of RMMs in Europe, the MAH should 
conduct and submit the results from an observational cohort study using existing 
data sources in European countries where dapagliflozin will be launched for T1DM. 
7.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication to include new indication for the treatment of insufficiently controlled type 1 
diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to insulin, when insulin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic 
control, for Forxiga and Edistride 5 mg film-coated tablets; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 
4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated accordingly. 
The RMP has also been updated to version 16.7.   
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
to SmPC, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Seffalair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years 
and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting β2 
agonists.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Patients should be  advised to take Seffalair Spiromax every day, even when asymptomatic. 
If symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be used for 
immediate relief. 
When choosing the starting dose strength of Seffalair Spiromax (12.75/100 micrograms medium inhaled 
corticosteroid [ICS] dose or 12.75/202 micrograms high ICS dose), the patients’ disease severity, their 
previous asthma therapy including ICS dose as well as the patients’ current control of asthma symptoms 
should be considered.  
Patients should be regularly reassessed by a doctor, so that the strength of the salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate they are receiving remains optimal and is only changed on medical advice. The dose should be 
titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is maintained.   
Note that the delivered  doses for Seffalair Spiromax are different from other salmeterol/fluticasone 
containing products on the market. The different dose strengths (medium/high doses of fluticasone) for 
different products do not necessarily correspond to each other, thus the products are not interchangeable 
based on the corresponding dose strengths.

Adults and adolescents 12 years and older. 
One inhalation of 12.75 micrograms salmeterol and 100 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily. 
or 
One inhalation of 12.75 micrograms salmeterol and 202 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily. 
Once control of asthma is attained, treatment should be reviewed and consideration given as to whether 
patients should be stepped down to salmeterol/fluticasone propionate containing a lower dose of the inhaled 
corticosteroid, and then, ultimately, to an inhaled corticosteroid alone. Regular review of patients as 
treatment is stepped down is important. 
If an individual patient should require dosages outside the recommended regimen, appropriate doses of β2 
agonist and/or inhaled corticosteroid should be prescribed. 
Special populations 
Elderly (>65 years) 
There is no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients  
Renal impairment 
There is no need to adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment 
There are no data available on the use of Seffalair Spiromax in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population  
The posology in patients 12 years of age and older is the same posology as in adults. The safety and efficacy 
in paediatric patients below 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Inhalation use.  
The device is a breath actuated, inspiratory flow-driven inhaler, which means that the active substances are 
delivered into the airways when the patient inhales through the mouthpiece.  
Required training 
This medicinal product should be used correctly in order to achieve effective treatment. As such, the patients 
should be advised to read the patient information leaflet carefully and follow the instructions for use as 
detailed in the leaflet. All patients should be provided with training by the prescribing Health Care 
Professional on how to use this medicinal product. This is to ensure that they understand how to use the 
inhaler correctly, and so that they understand the need to breathe in forcefully when inhaling to obtain the 
required dose. It is important to inhale forcefully to ensure optimal dosing. 
The use of this medicinal product follows 3 simple steps: open, breathe, and close, which are outlined below. 
Open: Hold the device with the mouthpiece cover at the bottom and open the mouthpiece cover by folding it 
down until it is fully opened when 1 click is heard. 
Breathe: Breathe out fully. Do not breathe out through your inhaler. Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and 
close your lips tightly around it. Breathe in forcefully and deeply through the mouthpiece. Remove the 
device from the mouth and hold the breath for 10 seconds or as long as comfortable for you. 
Close: Breathe out gently and close the mouthpiece cover. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should not block the air vents at any time, or breathe out through the device when they are preparing 
the “Breathe” step. Patients are not required to shake the inhaler prior to use.  
Patients should also be advised to rinse their mouths with water and spit the water out, and/or brush their 
teeth after inhaling (see section 4.4). 
Patients may notice a taste when using this medicinal product due to the lactose excipient. 
Patients should be advised to keep their inhaler dry and clean at all times by gently wiping the mouthpiece 
with a dry cloth or tissue as needed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Deterioration of disease 
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms for which a fast- and 
short-acting bronchodilator is required. Patients should be advised to have their rescue inhaler available to be 
used for relief in an acute asthma attack at all times. 
Patients should not be initiated on salmeterol/fluticasone propionate during an exacerbation, or if they have 
significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. 
Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with 
salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice 
if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation on salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. 
Increased requirements for use of reliever medication (short-acting bronchodilators), or decreased response 
to reliever medication indicate deterioration of asthma control and patients should be reviewed by a 
physician. 
Sudden and progressive deterioration in control of asthma is potentially life-threatening and the patient 
should undergo urgent medical assessment. Consideration should be given to increasing inhaled 
corticosteroid therapy.  
Cessation of therapy 
Treatment with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should not be stopped abruptly in patients with asthma due 
to risk of exacerbation. Therapy should be down-titrated under physician supervision.  
Coexisting conditions 
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should be administered with caution in patients with active or quiescent 
pulmonary tuberculosis and fungal, viral, or other infections of the airway. Appropriate treatment should be 
promptly instituted, if indicated. 
Cardiovascular effects 
Rarely, salmeterol/fluticasone propionate may cause cardiac arrhythmias e.g., supraventricular tachycardia, 
extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation, and a mild transient reduction in serum potassium at high therapeutic 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doses. Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular 
disorders or heart rhythm abnormalities and in patients with thyrotoxicosis,. 
Hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia 
Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalaemia in some patients, possibly through 
intracellular shunting, which has the potential to product adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease in 
serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation. Clinically significant changes serum 
potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate at 
recommended doses (see section 4.8). There have been infrequent reports of increases in blood glucose 
levels (see section 4.8) and this should be considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes 
mellitus. 
Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, uncorrected 
hypokalaemia, or patients predisposed to low levels of serum potassium.  
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after 
dosing and may be life-threatening (see section 4.8). This should be treated immediately with a short-acting 
inhaled bronchodilator. Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate should be discontinued immediately, the patient 
assessed, and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. 
Βeta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists 
The pharmacological effects of β2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, palpitations, and headache, have been 
reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. 
Systemic effects 
Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long 
periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects 
include Cushing’s syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in bone mineral density, 
cataract and glaucoma, and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including 
psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, or aggression (particularly in children) (see 
Paediatric population sub-heading below for information on the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids in 
children and adolescents). It is important, therefore, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of 
inhaled corticosteroid is reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. 
Visual disturbance 
Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with 
symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to 
an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases 
such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical 
corticosteroids. 
Adrenal function 
Prolonged treatment of patients with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids may result in adrenal suppression 
and acute adrenal crisis. Very rare cases of adrenal suppression and acute adrenal crisis have also been 
described with doses of fluticasone propionate between 500 micrograms and less than 1000 micrograms. 
Situations, which could potentially trigger acute adrenal crisis include trauma, surgery, infection, or any 
rapid reduction in dosage. Presenting symptoms are typically vague and may include anorexia, abdominal 
pain, weight loss, tiredness, headache, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, decreased level of consciousness, 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypoglycaemia, and seizures. Additional systemic corticosteroid treatment should be considered during 
periods of stress or elective surgery. 
The benefits of inhaled fluticasone propionate therapy should minimise the need for oral steroids, but 
patients transferring from oral steroids may remain at risk of impaired adrenal reserve for a considerable 
time. Therefore, these patients should be treated with special care and adrenocortical function regularly 
monitored. Patients who have required high dose emergency corticosteroid therapy in the past may also be at 
risk. This possibility of residual impairment should always be borne in mind in emergency and elective 
situations likely to produce stress, and appropriate corticosteroid treatment must be considered. The extent of 
the adrenal impairment may require specialist advice before elective procedures. 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Ritonavir can greatly increase the concentration of fluticasone propionate in plasma. Therefore, concomitant 
use should be avoided, unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid 
side effects. There is also an increased risk of systemic undesirable effects when combining fluticasone 
propionate with other potent CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5). 
Concomitant use of systemic ketoconazole significantly increases systemic exposure to salmeterol. This may 
lead to an increase in the incidence of systemic effects (e.g., prolongation in the QTc interval and 
palpitations). Concomitant treatment with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors should therefore 
be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risk of systemic undesirable effects of 
salmeterol treatment (see section 4.5). 
Paediatric population 
This medicinal product is indicated for use in adolescents 12 years and older (see section 4.2). However, it 
should be noted that children and adolescents less than 16 years taking high doses of fluticasone propionate 
(typically ≥1000 micrograms/day) may be at particular risk. Systemic effects may occur, particularly at high 
doses prescribed for long periods.  Possible systemic effects include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid 
features, adrenal suppression, acute adrenal crisis and growth retardation in children and adolescents and more 
rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, 
anxiety, depression, or aggression.  Consideration should be given to referring the child or adolescent to a 
paediatric respiratory specialist.  It is recommended that the height of children receiving prolonged treatment 
with inhaled corticosteroids is regularly monitored. The dose of inhaled corticosteroid should always be 
reduced to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. 
Oral infections 
Due to the fluticasone propionate component, hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat 
and, rarely of the oesophagus, can occur in some patients (see section 4.8). Both hoarseness and the 
incidence of candidiasis of the mouth and throat may be relieved by rinsing the mouth with water and 
spitting the water out and/or brushing the teeth after using the product. Symptomatic candidiasis of the 
mouth and throat can be treated with topical anti-fungal therapy whilst still continuing with 
salmeterol/fluticasone propionate. 
Lactose contents 
This medicinal product contains lactose (see section 4.3). Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. The excipient lactose may contain small amounts of milk proteins which may cause allergic 
reactions in  those with severe hypersensitivity or allergy to milk protein. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interactions with beta blockers 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beta adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of salmeterol. Both non-selective and selective 
β blockers should be avoided unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Potentially serious 
hypokalaemia may result from β2 agonist therapy (see section 4.4). Particular caution is advised in acute 
severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, 
and diuretics. 
Salmeterol 
Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of ketoconazole (400 mg orally once daily) and salmeterol (50 micrograms inhaled twice 
daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure (1.4-
fold Cmax and 15-fold AUC). This may lead to an increase in the incidence of other systemic effects of 
salmeterol treatment (e.g. prolongation of QTc interval and palpitations) compared with salmeterol or 
ketoconazole treatment alone (see section 4.4). 
Clinically significant effects were not seen on blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, and blood potassium 
levels. Co-administration with ketoconazole did not increase the elimination half-life of salmeterol or 
increase salmeterol accumulation with repeat dosing. 
The concomitant administration of ketoconazole should be avoided, unless the benefits outweigh the 
potentially increased risk of systemic effects of salmeterol treatment. There is likely to be a similar risk of 
interaction with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir). 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Co-administration of erythromycin (500 mg orally 3 times a day) and salmeterol (50 micrograms inhaled 
twice daily) in 15 healthy subjects for 6 days resulted in a small but non-statistically significant increase in 
salmeterol exposure (1.4-fold Cmax and 1.2-fold AUC). Co-administration with erythromycin was not 
associated with any serious adverse effects. 
Fluticasone propionate 
Under normal circumstances, low plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate are achieved after inhaled 
dosing, due to extensive first pass metabolism and high systemic clearance mediated by cytochrome P450 
3A4 in the gut and liver. Hence, clinically significant drug interactions mediated by fluticasone propionate 
are unlikely. 
In an interaction study in healthy subjects with intranasal fluticasone propionate, ritonavir (a highly potent 
cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor) administered 100 mg twice daily increased the fluticasone propionate 
plasma concentrations several hundred-fold, resulting in markedly reduced serum cortisol concentrations. 
Information about this interaction is lacking for inhaled fluticasone propionate, but a marked increase in 
fluticasone propionate plasma levels is expected. Cases of Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression have 
been reported. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of 
systemic glucocorticoid undesirable effects (see section 4.4). 
In a small study in healthy volunteers, the slightly less potent CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole increased the 
exposure of fluticasone propionate after a single inhalation by 150%. This resulted in a greater reduction of 
plasma cortisol as compared with fluticasone propionate alone. Co-treatment with other potent CYP3A 
inhibitors, such as itraconazole, and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as erythromycin, is also expected to 
increase the systemic fluticasone propionate exposure and the risk of systemic undesirable effects. Caution is 
recommended and long-term treatment with such drugs should, if possible, be avoided. 
Co-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, including cobicistat-containing products, is expected to increase the 
risk of systemic side-effects. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased 
risk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic 
corticosteroid effects. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interaction with P-glycoprotein inhibitors 
Fluticasone propionate and salmeterol are both poor substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Fluticasone did not 
show P-gp inhibition potential in in vitro studies. No information is available on salmeterol P-gp inhibition 
potential. No clinical pharmacology studies with a specific P-gp inhibitor and fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol have been conducted. 
Sympathomimetic medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of other sympathomimetic medicinal products (alone or as part of combination 
therapy) can have a potentially additive effect.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300 to 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicates no 
malformative or foeto/neonatal toxicity of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate. Animal studies have shown 
reproductive toxicity after administration of β2 adrenoreceptor agonists and glucocorticosteroids (see section 
5.3). 
 This medicianl product should only be used during pregnancy if the expected benefit to the patient justifies 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether salmeterol and fluticasone propionate/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
Studies have shown that salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and their metabolites, are excreted into the 
milk of lactating rats.  
A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue salmeterol/fluticasone propionate therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
There are no fertility data in humans. However, animal studies showed no effects of salmeterol or fluticasone 
propionate on fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
This medicinal product has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
As this medicinal product contains salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, the type and severity of adverse 
reactions associated with each of the active substance may be expected. No increased incidence of adverse 
reactions has been seen following concurrent administration of the two compounds. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (6.3%), headache (4.4%), cough (3.7%) 
and oral candidiasis (3.4%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Specific β2 agonist treatment effects 
The pharmacological effects of β2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, palpitations and headache, have been 
reported, but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. 
Paradoxical bronchospasm 
Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after 
dosing (see section 4.4).  
Inhaled corticosteroid treatment effects 
Due to the fluticasone propionate component, hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat and, 
rarely, of the oesophagus, can occur in some patients (see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Seffalair Spiromax in paediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been 
established.  
Inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone propionate, a component of Seffalair Spiromax, may cause a 
reduction in growth velocity in adolescents (see section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). 
The growth of paediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate, should be monitored routinely. To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled 
corticosteroids, including salmeterol/fluticasone propionate titrate each patient’s dosage to the lowest dosage 
that effectively controls his/her symptoms. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There are no data available from clinical trials on overdose with Seffalair Spiromax, however data on 
overdose with both active substances are given below: 
Salmeterol 
The signs and symptoms of salmeterol overdose are dizziness, increases in systolic blood pressure, tremor, 
headache and tachycardia. If salmeterol/fluticasone propionate therapy has to be withdrawn due to overdose 
of the β2 agonist component of the medicinal product, provision of appropriate replacement steroid therapy 
should be considered. Additionally, hypokalaemia can occur and therefore serum potassium levels should be 
monitored. Potassium replacement should be considered. 
Fluticasone propionate  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Acute  
Acute inhalation of fluticasone propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary 
suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a 
few days, as verified by plasma cortisol measurements. 
Chronic overdose  
Adrenal reserve should be monitored and treatment with a systemic corticosteroid may be necessary. When 
stabilised, treatment should be continued with an inhaled corticosteroid at the recommended dose. (see 
section 4.4: “Adrenal function”).  
In cases of both acute and chronic fluticasone propionate overdose, salmeterol/fluticasone propionate therapy 
should be continued at a suitable dose for symptom control.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for obstructive airway diseases, Adrenergics in combination with 
corticosteroids or other drugs, excl. anticholinergics, ATC code: R03AK06 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Seffalair Spiromax contains salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, which have differing modes of action. 
The respective mechanisms of action of both active substances are discussed below. 
Salmeterol is a selective long-acting (12 hour) β2 adrenoceptor agonist with a long side chain which binds to 
the exo-site of the receptor. 
Fluticasone propionate given by inhalation at recommended doses has a glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory 
action within the lungs. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Seffalair Spiromax Asthma clinical trials  
The safety and efficacy of Seffalair Spiromax were evaluated in 3004 patients with asthma.  The 
development program included 2 confirmatory trials of 12-weeks duration, a 26-week safety trial and 3 dose-
ranging trials. The efficacy of Seffalair Spiromax is based primarily on the the confirmatory trials described 
below. 
Six doses of fluticasone propionate ranging from 16 mcg to 434 mcg (expressed as metered doses) 
administered twice daily via multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) and an open-label fluticasone propionate 
dry powder comparator (100mcg or 250mcg) were evaluated in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled 12-week trials. Trial 201 was conducted in patients who were uncontrolled at baseline and had 
been treated by short-acting β2 agonist alone or in combination with non-corticosteroid asthma medication. 
Low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) patients may have been included after a minimum of 2 weeks 
washout. Trial 202 was conducted in patients who were uncontrolled at baseline and had been treated with 
high dose ICS with or without a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). The metered doses for fluticasone 
propionate Spiromax [Fp MDPI] (16, 28, 59, 118, 225, and 434 mcg) used in Trial 201 and Trial 202 are 
different from the metered doses for the comparator products (fluticasone inhalation powder) and the Phase 3 
investigational products which are the basis of the label claim metered dose (, 113, and 232 mcg for 
fluticasone propionate). The changes in doses between Phase 2 and 3 resulted from optimisation of the 
manufacturing process. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The efficacy and safety of 4 doses of salmeterol xinafoate were evaluated in a double-blind, 6-period 
crossover study compared with single dose fluticasone propionate Spiromax and open-label fluticasone 
propionate/salmeterol 100/50 mcg dry powder inhaler as a comparator in patients with persistent asthma. The 
salmeterol doses studied were 6.8 mcg, 13.2 mcg, 26.8 mcg, and 57.4 mcg in combination with fluticasone 
propionate 118 mcg delivered by MDPI (expressed as metered dose). The metered doses for salmeterol (6.8, 
13.2, 26.8, and 57.4 mcg) used in this study are slightly different from the metered doses for the comparator 
products (fluticasone/salmeterol inhalation powder) and the Phase 3 investigational products which are the 
basis of the label claim metered dose  (113, and 232 mcg for fluticasone propionate and 14 mcg for 
salmeterol).  
As a consequence of optimisation of the manufacturing process, the Phase 3 and commercial products better 
match the strengths of the comparator products. Plasma for pharmacokinetic characterization was obtained at 
each dosing period.  
Adult and Adolescent Patients Aged 12 Years and Older:  
Two Phase 3 clinical trials were conducted; 2 trials comparing the fixed-dose combination with fluticasone 
propionate alone or placebo (Trial 1 and Trial 2). 
Trials comparing Seffalair Spiromax (FS MDPI) with fluticasone propionate alone or placebo 
Two double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials, Trial 1 and Trial 2, were conducted with FS MDPI in 1375  
adult and adolescent patients (aged 12 years and older, with baseline FEV1 40% to 85% of predicted normal) 
with asthma that was not optimally controlled on their current therapy. All treatments were given as 1 
inhalation twice a day from the Spiromax inhaler, and other maintenance therapies were discontinued.  
Trial 1: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, efficacy and safety trial compared Fp 
MDPI 55 mcg and 113 mcg (1 inhalation twice a day) with FS MDPI (14/55 mcg and 14/113 mcg (1 
inhalation twice a day) and placebo in adolescents (aged 12 years and older) and adult patients with 
persistent symptomatic asthma despite low-dose or mid-dose inhaled corticosteroid or inhaled 
corticosteroid/LABA therapy. Patients received single-blinded placebo MDPI and were switched from their 
baseline ICS therapy to beclomethasone dipropionate inhalation aerosol 40 mcg twice daily during the run-in 
period. Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or mid-strength dose treatments as follows: 130 
received placebo, 130 received Fp MDPI 113 mcgand 129 received FS MDPI 14/113 mcg. Baseline FEV1 
measurements were similar across treatments groups. The primary endpoints for this trial were the change 
from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 for all patients and standardized baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h 
at week 12 analyzed for a subset of 312 patients who performed post-dose serial spirometry.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Seffalair 
Spiromax in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of asthma (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
For pharmacokinetic purposes each component can be considered separately. 
Salmeterol 
Salmeterol acts locally in the lung therefore plasma levels are not an indication of therapeutic effects. In 
addition, there are only limited data available on the pharmacokinetics of salmeterol because of the technical 
difficulty of assaying the drug in plasma due to the low plasma concentrations at therapeutic doses 
(approximately 200 picogram/mL or less) achieved after inhaled dosing. 
Fluticasone propionate 
The absolute bioavailability of a single dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate in healthy subjects varies 
between approximately 5% to 11% of the nominal dose depending on the inhalation device used. In patients 
with asthma a lesser degree of systemic exposure to inhaled fluticasone propionate has been observed. 
Absorption 
Systemic absorption occurs mainly through the lungs and is initially rapid then prolonged. The remainder of 
the inhaled dose of fluticasone propionate may be swallowed but contributes minimally to systemic exposure 
due to the low aqueous solubility and presystemic metabolism, resulting in oral availability of less than 1%. 
There is a linear increase in systemic exposure with increasing inhaled dose.  
Distribution  
The disposition of fluticasone propionate is characterised by high plasma clearance (1150 mL/min), a large 
volume of distribution at steady-state (approximately 300 L), and a terminal half-life of approximately 8 
hours. Plasma protein binding is 91%. 
Biotransformation 
Fluticasone propionate is cleared very rapidly from the systemic circulation. The main pathway is 
metabolism to an inactive carboxylic acid metabolite, by the cytochrome P450 3A4. Other unidentified 
metabolites are also found in the faeces.  
Elimination 
The renal clearance of fluticasone propionate is negligible. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted in urine, 
mainly as metabolites. The main part of the dose is excreted in faeces as metabolites and unchanged drug. 
Paediatric population 
A pharmacokinetic analysis of patients aged 12 through 17 was performed. Although the subgroups were 
small, systemic exposure of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol for the 12 to 17 years and ≥18 years 
subgroups in all treatments was not markedly different to the overall study population. The apparent 
elimination half-life (t½) was not impacted by age. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The only safety concerns for human use derived from animal studies of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate 
given separately were effects associated with exaggerated pharmacological actions. 
Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac 
arrhythmias and sudden death (with histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis) when beta-agonists and 
methylxanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. 
In animal reproduction studies, glucocorticosteroids have been shown to induce decreased foetal body 
weight and/or malformations (cleft palate, skeletal malformations) in rats, mice, and rabbits with 
subcutaneously administered maternal toxic doses. However, these animal experimental results do not seem 
to be relevant for man given recommended doses and fluticasone propionate administered via inhalation to 
rats decreased foetal body weight, but did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose less than the 
maximum recommended human daily inhaled dose on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis. Experience with 
oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than 
humans. Animal studies with salmeterol have shown embryo foetal toxicity only at high exposure levels. 
Following co-administration, increased incidences of transposed umbilical artery and incomplete ossification 
of occipital bone were found in rats at doses associated with known glucocorticoid-induced abnormalities.

Package leaflet: Information for the patient 
Seffalair Spiromax 12.75 micrograms/100 micrograms inhalation powder 
salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even if 
their signs of illness are the same as yours.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. This includes any possible side 
effects not listed in this leaflet. See section 4.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Seffalair Spiromax is and what it is used for 
Seffalair Spiromax contains 2 active substances: salmeterol and fluticasone propionate: 
•  Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators help the airways into the lungs to stay open. 
This makes it easier for air to get in and out. The effects of salmeterol last for at least 12 hours. 
•  Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid which reduces swelling and irritation in the lungs. 
Seffalair Spiromax is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
Seffalair Spiromax helps to prevent breathlessness and wheeziness coming on. You should not use it to 
relieve an asthma attack. If you have an asthma attack, use a fast-acting reliever (rescue) inhaler, such 
as salbutamol. You should always have your fast-acting rescue inhaler with you. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Seffalair Spiromax  
Do not use Seffalair Spiromax 
- 
if you are allergic to salmeterol, fluticasone propionate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Seffalair Spiromax if you have: 
•  Heart disease, including an irregular or fast heart beat 
•  Overactive thyroid gland 
•  High blood pressure 
•  Diabetes (Seffalair Spiromax may increase your blood sugar) 
•  Low potassium in your blood  
•  Tuberculosis (TB) now or have had in the past, or have other lung infections 
Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. 
Children and adolescents 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not give this medicine to children or adolescents under the age of 12 years because it has not been studied 
in this age group. 
Other medicines and Seffalair Spiromax 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking or, have recently taken or might use any other 
medicines. Seffalair Spiromax may not be suitable for use with some other medicines.  
Tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines, before starting to use Seffalair Spiromax: 
•  Beta blockers (such as atenolol, propranolol and sotalol). Beta blockers are mostly used for high blood 
pressure or heart conditions such as angina. 
•  Medicines to treat infections (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole and erythromycin). Some of 
these medicines may increase the amount of salmeterol or fluticasone propionate in your body. This can 
increase side effects with Seffalair Spiromax, including irregular heartbeats, or may make side effects 
worse. 
•  Corticosteroids (by mouth or by injection). Recent use of these medicines might increase the risk of 
Seffalair Spiromax affecting your adrenal glands by reducing the amount of steroid hormones produced 
by the glands (adrenal suppression). 
•  Diuretics, medicines that increase urine production and are used to treat high blood pressure.  
•  Other bronchodilators (such as salbutamol).  
•  Xanthine medicines such as aminophylline and theophylline. These are often used to treat asthma. 
Some medicines may increase the effects of Seffalair Spiromax and your doctor may wish to monitor you 
carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
It is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, check with your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Seffalair Spiromax is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Seffalair Spiromax contains lactose 
Each dose of this medicine contains approximately 5.4 milligrams of lactose. If you have been told by your 
doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
3. 
How to use Seffalair Spiromax 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one inhalation twice a day. 
•  Seffalair Spiromax is for long-term regular use. Use it every day to keep your asthma under control. Do 
not use more than the recommended dose. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not 
sure. 
•  Do not stop taking Seffalair Spiromax or reduce the dose without talking to your doctor or nurse first. 
•  Seffalair Spiromax should be inhaled through the mouth. 
Your doctor or nurse will help you to manage your asthma. The doctor or nurse will change your inhaler 
medicine if you need a different dose to control your asthma properly. However, do not change the number 
of inhalations your doctor or nurse has prescribed without talking to your doctor or nurse first. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your asthma or breathing gets worse tell your doctor straight away. If you feel more wheezy, your 
chest feels tight more often, or you need to use more of your fast-acting ‘reliever’ medicine, your asthma 
may be getting worse and you could become seriously ill. Continue to use Seffalair Spiromax but do not 
increase the number of inhalations you take. See your doctor at once as you may need additional treatment. 
Instructions for use 
Training 
Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should train you on how to use your inhaler, including how to 
inhale a dose effectively. This training is important to ensure you receive the dose you require. If you 
have not received this training please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to show you how to use 
your inhaler properly before you use it for the first time.   
Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should also check from time to time that you are using the Spiromax 
device properly and as prescribed. If you are not using Seffalair Spiromax properly or you are not breathing 
it in forcefully enough, you may not be getting enough medicine into your lungs. This means that the 
medicine will not help your asthma as well as it should. 
Preparing your Seffalair Spiromax  
Before using your Seffalair Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: 
•  Check the dose indicator to see that there are 60 inhalations in the inhaler. 
•  Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label on the inhaler. 
•  You do not need to shake your inhaler before you use it. 
How to take an inhalation 
1.  Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover at the bottom.  
2.  Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until you hear a loud click. This will measure out one 
dose of your medicine. Your inhaler is now ready for use. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. 
4.  Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips tightly around it. Take care not to block the air 
vents. 
Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can.  
  Note that it is important that you breathe in forcefully. 
5. 
 Remove your inhaler from your mouth. You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation. 
6.  Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can.  
7.  Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler).  
8.  Close the mouthpiece cover.  
43 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  After each dose, rinse your mouth with water, and spit it out or brush your teeth before rinsing.  
•  Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover.  
•  The cover is fixed to your inhaler and must not be taken off.  
•  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has come apart from your 
Spiromax. 
•  Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your inhaler. 
Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your inhaler dry and clean. 
If necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your inhaler after use with a dry cloth or tissue. 
When to start using a new Seffalair Spiromax 
•  The dose indicator on the rear of the device tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your 
inhaler, starting at 60 when it is full and ending with 0 (zero) when it is empty.  
•  The dose indicator shows the number of inhalations remaining as even numbers. The spaces between the 
even numbers represent the odd number of remaining inhalations. 
•  When 20 or fewer are left, the numbers are shown in red on a white background. When the red numbers 
appear in the window, you should see your doctor or nurse to get a new inhaler. 
Note:  
•  The mouthpiece clicks even when your inhaler is empty.  
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
If you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still register it 
as a count. This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next inhalation is due. It is 
impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in 1 inhalation.  
If you use more Seffalair Spiromax than you should 
It is important that you take the dose that your doctor or nurse has prescribed. You should not exceed the 
prescribed dose without medical advice. If you accidentally take more doses than recommended, talk to your 
nurse, doctor or pharmacist. You may notice your heart beating faster than usual and that you feel shaky. 
You may also have dizziness, a headache, muscle weakness and aching joints. 
If you have repeatedly used too many doses of Seffalair Spiromax for a long time, you should talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice. This is because using too much Seffalair Spiromax can reduce the amount of 
steroid hormones produced by your adrenal glands.  
If you forget to use Seffalair Spiromax 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. If it is nearly time for your next dose just take your next dose at the usual time. 
If you stop using Seffalair Spiromax 
It is very important that you take your Seffalair Spiromax every day as advised. Keep taking it until your 
doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop or suddenly reduce your dose of Seffalair Spiromax. This could 
make your breathing worse. 
In addition, if you suddenly stop taking Seffalair Spiromax or reduce your dose of Seffalair Spiromax this 
may (very rarely) cause problems due to your adrenal glands producing reduced amounts of steroid hormone 
(adrenal insufficiency) which sometimes causes side effects. 
These side effects may include any of the following: 
•  Stomach pain 
•  Tiredness and loss of appetite, feeling sick 
•  Sickness and diarrhoea 
•  Weight loss 
•  Headache or drowsiness 
•  Low levels of sugar in your blood 
•  Low blood pressure and seizures (fits) 
When your body is under stress such as from fever, accident or injury, infection, or surgery, adrenal 
insufficiency can get worse and you may also have the side effects listed above. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. To prevent these symptoms, your doctor may 
prescribe extra corticosteroids in tablet form (such as prednisolone). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. To reduce the 
chance of side effects your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose of this combination of drugs to control your 
asthma. 
Allergic reactions: you may notice your breathing suddenly gets worse immediately after using 
Seffalair Spiromax. You may be very wheezy and cough or be short of breath. You may also notice itching, 
a rash (hives) and swelling (usually of the face, lips, tongue or throat), or you may suddenly feel that your 
heart is beating very fast or you feel faint and light headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consciousness). If you get any of these effects or if they happen suddenly after using Seffalair 
Spiromax, stop using Seffalair Spiromax and tell your doctor straight away. Allergic reactions to 
Seffalair Spiromax are uncommon (they may affect up to 1 in 100 people).  
Other side effects are listed below: 
Common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people) 
•  A fungal infection (thrush) causing sore, creamy-yellow, raised patches in the mouth and throat, as well 
as a sore tongue, hoarse voice and throat irritation. Rinsing your mouth with water and spitting it out 
immediately or brushing your teeth after each inhalation may help. Your doctor may prescribe an anti-
fungal medicine to treat the thrush.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Seffalair Spiromax is and what it is used for 
Seffalair Spiromax contains 2 active substances: salmeterol and fluticasone propionate: 
•  Salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators help the airways into the lungs to stay open. 
This makes it easier for air to get in and out. The effects of salmeterol last for at least 12 hours. 
•  Fluticasone propionate is a corticosteroid which reduces swelling and irritation in the lungs. 
Seffalair Spiromax is used to treat asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
Seffalair Spiromax helps to prevent breathlessness and wheeziness coming on. You should not use it to 
relieve an asthma attack. If you have an asthma attack, use a fast-acting reliever (rescue) inhaler, such 
as salbutamol. You should always have your fast-acting rescue inhaler with you. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Seffalair Spiromax  
Do not use Seffalair Spiromax 
- 
if you are allergic to salmeterol, fluticasone propionate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Seffalair Spiromax if you have: 
•  Heart disease, including an irregular or fast heart beat 
•  Overactive thyroid gland 
•  High blood pressure 
•  Diabetes (Seffalair Spiromax may increase your blood sugar) 
•  Low potassium in your blood  
•  Tuberculosis (TB) now or have had in the past, or have other lung infections 
Contact your doctor if you experience blurred vision or other visual disturbances. 
Children and adolescents 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not give Seffalair Spiromax to children or adolescents under the age of 12 years because it has not been 
studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Seffalair Spiromax 
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking or, have recently taken or might use any other 
medicines. Seffalair Spiromax may not be suitable for use with some other medicines.  
Tell your doctor if you are taking the following medicines, before starting to use Seffalair Spiromax: 
•  Beta blockers (such as atenolol, propranolol and sotalol). Beta blockers are mostly used for high blood 
pressure or heart conditions such as angina. 
•  Medicines to treat infections (such as ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole and erythromycin). Some of 
these medicines may increase the amount of salmeterol or fluticasone propionate in your body. This can 
increase side effects with Seffalair Spiromax, including irregular heartbeats, or may make side effects 
worse. 
•  Corticosteroids (by mouth or by injection). Recent use of these medicines might increase the risk of 
Seffalair Spiromax affecting your adrenal glands by reducing the amount of steroid hormones produced 
by the glands (adrenal suppression). 
•  Diuretics, medicines that increase urine production and are used to treat high blood pressure.  
•  Other bronchodilators (such as salbutamol).  
•  Xanthine medicines such as aminophylline and theophylline. These are often used to treat asthma. 
Some medicines may increase the effects of Seffalair Spiromax and your doctor may wish to monitor you 
carefully if you are taking these medicines (including some medicines for HIV: ritonavir, cobicistat). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.  
It is not known if this medicine can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, check with your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Seffalair Spiromax is not likely to affect your ability to drive or use machines. 
Seffalair Spiromax contains lactose 
Each dose of this medicine contains approximately 5.4 milligrams of lactose. If you have been told by your 
doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
3. 
How to use Seffalair Spiromax 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one inhalation twice a day. 
•  Seffalair Spiromax is for long-term regular use. Use it every day to keep your asthma under control. Do 
not use more than the recommended dose. Check with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are not 
sure. 
•  Do not stop taking Seffalair Spiromax or reduce the dose without talking to your doctor or nurse first. 
•  Seffalair Spiromax should be inhaled through the mouth. 
Your doctor or nurse will help you to manage your asthma. The doctor or nurse will change your inhaler 
medicine if you need a different dose to control your asthma properly. However, do not change the number 
of inhalations your doctor or nurse has prescribed without talking to your doctor or nurse first. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If your asthma or breathing gets worse tell your doctor straight away. If you feel more wheezy, your 
chest feels tight more often, or you need to use more of your fast-acting ‘reliever’ medicine, your asthma 
may be getting worse and you could become seriously ill. Continue to use Seffalair Spiromax but do not 
increase the number of inhalations you take. See your doctor at once as you may need additional treatment. 
Instructions for use 
Training 
Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should train you on how to use your inhaler, including how to 
inhale a dose effectively. This training is important to ensure you receive the dose you require. If you 
have not received this training please ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to show you how to use 
your inhaler properly before you use it for the first time.   
Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist should also check from time to time that you are using the Spiromax 
device properly and as prescribed. If you are not using Seffalair Spiromax properly or you are not breathing 
it in forcefully enough, you may not be getting enough medicine into your lungs. This means that the 
medicine will not help your asthma as well as it should. 
Preparing your Seffalair Spiromax  
Before using your Seffalair Spiromax for the first time, you need to prepare it for use as follows: 
•  Check the dose indicator to see that there are 60 inhalations in the inhaler. 
•  Write the date you opened the foil pouch on the label on the inhaler. 
•  You do not need to shake your inhaler before you use it. 
How to take an inhalation 
1.  Hold your inhaler with the semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover at the bottom.  
2.  Open the mouthpiece cover by folding it down until you hear a loud click. This will measure out one 
dose of your medicine. Your inhaler is now ready for use. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Breathe out gently (as far as is comfortable). Do not breathe out through your inhaler. 
4.  Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips tightly around it. Take care not to block the air 
vents. 
Breathe in through your mouth as deeply and as hard as you can.  
  Note that it is important that you breathe in forcefully. 
5.  Remove your inhaler from your mouth. You may notice a taste when you take your inhalation. 
6.  Hold your breath for 10 seconds or as long as you comfortably can.  
7.  Then breathe out gently (do not breathe out through the inhaler).  
8.  Close the mouthpiece cover.  
53 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
After each dose, rinse your mouth with water, and spit it out or brush your teeth before rinsing.  
•  Do not try to take your inhaler apart, remove or twist the mouthpiece cover.  
•  The cover is fixed to your inhaler and must not be taken off.  
•  Do not use your Spiromax if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has come apart from your 
Spiromax.  
•  Do not open and close the mouthpiece cover unless you are about to use your inhaler. 
Cleaning your Spiromax 
Keep your inhaler dry and clean. 
If necessary you may wipe the mouthpiece of your inhaler after use with a dry cloth or tissue. 
When to start using a new Seffalair Spiromax 
•  The dose indicator on the rear of the device tells you how many doses (inhalations) are left in your 
inhaler, starting at 60 when it is full and ending with 0 (zero) when it is empty.  
•  The dose indicator shows the number of inhalations remaining as even numbers. The spaces between the 
even numbers represent the odd number of remaining inhalations. 
•  When 20 or fewer are left, the numbers are shown in red on a white background. When the red numbers 
appear in the window, you should see your doctor or nurse to get a new inhaler. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:  
•  The mouthpiece clicks even when your inhaler is empty.  
• 
If you open and close the mouthpiece without taking an inhalation the dose indicator will still register it 
as a count. This dose will be securely held inside the inhaler for when the next inhalation is due. It is 
impossible to accidentally take extra medicine or a double dose in 1 inhalation.  
If you use more Seffalair Spiromax than you should 
It is important that you take the dose that your doctor or nurse has prescribed. You should not exceed the 
prescribed dose without medical advice. If you accidentally take more doses than recommended, talk to your 
nurse, doctor or pharmacist. You may notice your heart beating faster than usual and that you feel shaky. 
You may also have dizziness, a headache, muscle weakness and aching joints. 
If you have repeatedly used too many doses of Seffalair Spiromax for a long time, you should talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice. This is because using too much Seffalair Spiromax can reduce the amount of 
steroid hormones produced by your adrenal glands.  
If you forget to use Seffalair Spiromax 
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However do not take a double dose to make up 
for a forgotten dose. If it is nearly time for your next dose just take your next dose at the usual time. 
If you stop using Seffalair Spiromax 
It is very important that you take your Seffalair Spiromax every day as advised. Keep taking it until your 
doctor tells you to stop. Do not stop or suddenly reduce your dose of Seffalair Spiromax. This could 
make your breathing worse. 
In addition, if you suddenly stop taking Seffalair Spiromax or reduce your dose of Seffalair Spiromax this 
may (very rarely) cause problems due to your adrenal glands producing reduced amounts of steroid hormone 
(adrenal insufficiency) which sometimes causes side effects. 
These side effects may include any of the following: 
•  Stomach pain 
•  Tiredness and loss of appetite, feeling sick 
•  Sickness and diarrhoea 
•  Weight loss 
•  Headache or drowsiness 
•  Low levels of sugar in your blood 
•  Low blood pressure and seizures (fits) 
When your body is under stress such as from fever, accident or injury, infection, or surgery, adrenal 
insufficiency can get worse and you may also have the side effects listed above. 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. To prevent these symptoms, your doctor may 
prescribe extra corticosteroids in tablet form (such as prednisolone). 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. To reduce the 
chance of side effects your doctor will prescribe the lowest dose of this combination of drugs to control your 
asthma. 
55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Allergic reactions: you may notice your breathing suddenly gets worse immediately after using 
Seffalair Spiromax. You may be very wheezy and cough or be short of breath. You may also notice itching, 
a rash (hives) and swelling (usually of the face, lips, tongue or throat), or you may suddenly feel that your 
heart is beating very fast or you feel faint and light headed (which may lead to collapse or loss of 
consciousness). If you get any of these effects or if they happen suddenly after using Seffalair 
Spiromax, stop using Seffalair Spiromax and tell your doctor straight away. Allergic reactions to

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures, 
which  have  been  finalised  before  1  February  2004.  For  scientific  information  on  procedures 
after this date please refer to module 8B.

Introduction 
Metalyse  is  a  new  thrombolytic  agent  containing  the  active  substance  tenecteplase  (TNK  tPA).  It  is 
intended  for  fibrinolytic  treatment  in  the  acute  phase  of  myocardial  infarction,  and  should  be 
administered as an intravenous bolus over approximately 10 seconds in a weight-adjusted dose range 
from  30  to  50  mg.  The  clinical  benefits  of  fibrinolytic  therapy  in  patients  with  acute  myocardial 
infarction (AMI) are well documented, and a close correlation between early treatment and survival is 
established. The rationale for the development of TNK-tPA was to find a fibrinolytic substance close 
to the native t-PA, which can be administered as a rapid, single bolus injection. 
TNK-tPA  is  an  enzyme  (serine  protease)  that  converts  plasminogen  to  plasmin,  primarily  in  the 
presence  of  fibrin.  TNK-tPA  also  binds  to  fibrin  in  a  thrombus  and  selectively  converts  thrombus-
bound  plasminogen  to  plasmin.  This  initiates  local  proteolysis  of  the  fibrin  matrix  of  the  thrombus. 
Tenecteplase  is  a  glycoprotein  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technique  using  Chinese  Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cells. It is a modified form of the naturally occurring human plasminogen activator. The 
molecule exhibits a well-known pronounced domain structure. Three sites of the molecule have been 
modified  using  site  directed  mutagenesis,  thus  tenecteplase  has  different  pharmacokinetic  properties 
from those of r-tPA.  
Metalyse is presented as a lyophilised powder in a 20-ml glass vial with a rubber stopper and a vial 
cap with an integrated reconstitution device. It is available in three doses, 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg. 
The powder is reconstituted with water for injections from a pre-filled syringe.

Development  pharmaceutics:  The  choice  of  composition  has  been  explained  and  is  supported  by 
results  from  the  pharmaceutical  development.  Three  vial  strengths  are  manufactured  from 
formulations that differ only in their amount of TNK-tPA.  
An overfill for the three different dosage forms intended to ensure that the withdrawable contents of 
the vials are not less than the labelled contents has been sufficiently justified. 
The  manufacturing  process  is  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  adequately  validated  with  overall 
consistent results for the three dosage forms.  
Active substance 
The test procedures and validation reports are included in the dossier and have been clearly presented. 
As regards the choice of the routine tests it is considered that the list of quality characteristics to be 
tested is justified.   
Potential  impurities  arising  from  the  expression  system  include  CHO-proteins.  The  removal  of  host 
cell derived DNA has been addressed by validation data. The “validation approach” as such appears 
justified. Thus, the absence of the quality characteristic “residual DNA” in the bulk specification for 
routine testing is considered to be acceptable.  
Development Genetics 
A  mutant  CHO  cell  line  was  used.  This  cell  line  had  a  long  history  of  changes  as  it  was  already 
established from a subclone of the original cell line. A clone of this CHO cell line was selected and 
transfected with the TNK-tPA expression plasmid and co- transfected with a DHFR selection vector. 
Both plasmids are described in sufficient detail.  
A detailed map of both plasmids and sequencing data are provided.  
Cell Bank System 
The master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB) and end-of-production cells (EOP) have been 
adequately  characterised.  The  absence  of  adventitious  agents,  viral  and  non-viral  contaminants  has 
been confirmed by several methods.  
The genetic stability of the MCB was examined. The specific productivity of EOP cells of 4 validation 
runs  was  compared  to  the  specific  productivity  measured  during  the  cell  bank  stability  study.  Data 
with regard to TNK-tPA cell banks, from various thawings over a period of storage exceeding 4 years 
2/22 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have shown that the length of storage has no negative effect on the viability of the cells. Additionally, 
information  on  the  viability  of  individual  cell  banks  (MCB  and  WCBs)  used  for  manufacturing  has 
been provided. In this context it should also be mentioned that whenever a new cell bank is prepared a 
variation should be filed to the EMEA. 
Fermentation and Harvesting 
The  fermentation  is  generally  started  from  the  released  WCB’s,  but  exceptionally  the  applicant  has 
confirmed that the fermentation may start using the MCB. The fermentation process is performed in 
three stages, a seed train, an inoculum train and a production culture.  
The in-process controls for each step are provided and appear sufficient to control the process.  
The only ingredient of animal origin is hydrolised peptone. This raw material is of bovine, porcine 
and equine origin. The starting material for the peptone comes from the USA, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand. Certificates for all countries of origin have been submitted. Steam sterilisation 
of hydrolised peptone is performed at 121oC for 20 minutes. A risk evaluation has been performed 
and is satisfactory. 
Extensive data on the validation of the fermentation are provided. 
Purification 
A single batch of harvest cell culture fluid is produced from each 12,000 l fermenter and purified. The 
purification comprises chromatography steps, a viral inactivation step and a number of filtration steps. 
Sufficient details have been provided on reagents, columns and purification conditions. 
Characterisation 
Tenecteplase  (TNK-tPA)  is  a  mutated  variant  of  recombinant  tissue  plasminogen  activator  alteplase 
(rt-PA).  It  is  a  multidomain  protein  involved  in  the  regulation  of  the  fibrinolytic  pathway  of 
haemostasis.  Tenecteplase  (TNK-tPA)  was  developed  as  a  second  generation  molecule  in  which  6 
amino  acids  (out  of  527)  were  mutated.  Tenecteplase  results  from  the  modification  of  alteplase  at  3 
specific sites: T (Thr 103 to Asn), N (Asn 117 to Gln) and K (Lys-His-Arg-Arg (296-299) to Ala-Ala-
Ala-Ala). These amino acid substitutions have resulted in significant differences in the carbohydrate 
moiety  of  the  molecule.  The  presence  of  3  proteolytic  cleavage  products  previously  observed  in 
alteplase  was  confirmed  by  N-terminal  analysis.  The  amino  acid  sequence  has  been  unequivocally 
determined. The observed amino acid sequence of tenecteplase has been shown to be consistent with 
the intended sequence as predicted by the DNA sequence by a combination of methods. 
Analytical Development 
Full details on the various tests used have been provided and are satisfactory. 
Since  there  is  no  international  reference  material  for  TNK-tPA  available,  Boehringer  Ingelheim 
developed  and  qualified  a  respective  in-house  reference  material  for  in-process-,  bulk  and  release 
testing of TNK-tPA.  
Process validation 
Testing  EOP  cultures  for  sterility,  mycoplasma  contamination,  endotoxin  level,  retroviruses  and 
adventititious  viruses  has  shown 
there  are  no  contaminating  adventitious  microorganisms. 
Measurement  of  RVLP  in  EOP  cells  results  in  RVLP  concentrations  typical  for  CHO  cell  lines  and 
infectivity tests were always negative. 
Process validation has been carried out for growth parameters. 
Purification process 
The process qualification requirements and acceptance criteria studies were conducted on 3 batches.  
Data on the capacity to remove impurities are provided for each step of the purification process. The 
reduction of these impurities has been demonstrated. Re-use studies for the columns are provided and 
a cycle number has been established for each column.

Impurities 
Detailed information on the impurity profile and the removal of impurities has been provided. These 
data  demonstrate  that  the  purification  process  produces  active  substance  with  acceptable  residual 
impurities. 
CHO  proteins  are  the  only  impurity  that  is  routinely  tested  in  the  active  substance.  For  all  other 
impurities,  including host  cell  DNA, a  validation approach is used. The validation approach  as such 
appears  justified  on  the  basis  of  the  results  of  the  studies  submitted  on  the  removal  of  DNA.  The 
omission of a specification limit for DNA in the bulk drug substance is acceptable, provided that an 
IPC for DNA is performed for a certain number of batches. 
Whenever  changes  in  the  manufacturing  process  are  made  the  removal  of  the  impurities  should  be 
considered  and  a  revalidation  performed  if  relevant,  especially  for  those  impurities  for  which  a 
validation approach was used. 
Batch Analysis 
Batch analyses of the bulk active substance have been performed on 4 batches produced at the 12,000-
l  scale  at  Boehringer  Ingelheim.  The  bulks  were  derived  from  4  different  fermentation  runs.  These 
batches include the process validation batches. The assays for bulk analysis have been described.  
The test results on 4 Batches of Bulk Drug Substance manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim met the 
specifications.  The  company  further  provides  a  batch  data  assessment  in  which  the  results  are 
summarised  separately  for  each  parameter.  The  results  are  also  satisfactory.  Product  consistency  for 
the batches from this process can therefore be established.  
Control of the finished product 
The finished product release specification for the 30, 40 and 50 mg dosage forms and test procedures 
have  been  provided.  The  results  from  batch  analysis  are  satisfactory.  Product  consistency  can  be 
established. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability tests on the active substance   
The  stability  testing  of  the  Bulk  active  Substance  of  TNK-tPA  was  performed  on  3  batches 
manufactured at the 12000 l scale and the data support the claimed shelf life.  
Stability tests on the finished product 
A  total  of  10  batches  of  the  lyophilisate,  comprising  30,  40  and  50  mg  preparations,  all  of  them 
manufactured  at  Boehringer  Ingelheim,  have  been  investigated  in  stability  trials.  Satisfactory  3-year 
stability data are now available. On this basis, a shelf-life of 3 years can be granted. The recommended storage 
temperature is up to 30°C. 
Virological Documentation 
The viral validation studies were performed in accordance with the appropriate ICH guidelines. 
The  MCB  and  EOP  cells  have  been  extensively  investigated  for  contamination  with  viral  agents. 
Particular  attention  was  paid  to  the  investigation  of  potential  retrovirus  contamination  of  the  MCB, 
WCB  and  EOP  cells.  No  infectious  retrovirus  was  found.  In  vitro  assays  for  adventitious  viral 
contaminants have been  performed on the MCB,  WCB and EOP  cells. To  date  no evidence of viral 
contamination has been observed. 
The in-vivo assay for adventitious viral contaminants (test for the presence of inapparent, latent virus) 
was conducted with adult and suckling mice, guinea pigs and embryonated eggs. 
Hamster and mouse antibody production test (HAP, MAP) were performed with the MCB, WCB and 
EOP cells. 
In  concentrated  culture  fluids  from  the  WCB  including  EOP  cells  reverse  transcriptase  activity  was 
detected, indicating the presence of particles containing reverse transcriptase, which is usual for CHO 
cells.  Since  the  CHO  cells  used  for  the  production  contain  endogenous  retrovirus-like  particles  it  is 
4/22

important that the purification process should remove or inactivate these viruses as demonstrated with 
the X-MuLV model virus.  
Purification process 
BI  to  demonstrate  the  capacity  of  the  purification  process  to  eliminate  viruses  performed  viral 
clearance studies. Full details of scale-down and the spiking experiments of the relevant purification 
steps have been provided. The choice of the model viruses in the BI study appears reasonable. 
Solvent 
The  prefilled  syringes  with  water  for  injections  are  manufactured  at  Abbott  Laboratories,  North 
Carolina  27801,  USA.  10  ml  propylene  plastic  syringes  (Ansyr)  are  used.  Three  different  fill 
volumes  are  specified,  6  ml,  8  ml,  and  10  ml.  A  short  description  of  the  product  preparation  is 
provided. The product is terminally sterilised. The specifications meet Ph Eur requirements. 
The quality control testing and release of the prefilled water for injections syringes is performed at BI 
Pharma KG, Biberach, Germany. 
Stability data are submitted for 3 batches representing the 10 ml, 8 ml and 6 ml volumes. The given 
shelf-life specifications meet the Ph Eur requirements in the monograph water for injection. Based on 
the provided data, the shelf life of 24 months as proposed by the company is acceptable. 
Statement on GMP 
The  finished  product  is  manufactured  and  released  in  the  EU  by  Boehringer  Ingelhein  KG, 
Birkendorfer  Strasse  65,  D-88397  Biberach  an  der  Riss,  Germany.  A  copy  of  the  current 
manufacturing licence has been provided. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The substance is well characterised and the consistency of the product and the production process is 
deemed sufficient. The dossier takes into account current directives and guideline requirements as well 
as demonstrating that the medicinal product is made in compliance with the CPMP Note for Guidance 
on  minimising  the  risk  of  transmitting  animal  spongiform  encephalopathy  agents  via  medicinal 
products.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
• 
In vitro studies  
Results of in vitro studies demonstrated that clot lysis activity in human plasma induced by TNK-tPA 
was similar to that observed for tPA. At least a 10-fold higher fibrin specificity and an 80-fold higher 
resistance to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1 were found for TNK-tPA compared 
to tPA. 
In vivo studies  
• 
Thrombolytic  efficacy,  possible  side  effects  as  systemic  fibrinolysis  and  bleeding  tendencies  were 
investigated in various animal models. It was shown that TNK-tPA was more potent in clot lysis than 
tPA.  Furthermore,  TNK-tPA  decreased  systemic  fibrinolytic  parameters  to  a  lesser  extent  than  tPA. 
The  increased  fibrin  specificity  of  TNK-tPA  reduces  the  propensity  for  causing  peripheral  bleeding 
and ameliorates the risk of cerebral haemorrhages in a rabbit model of embolic stroke. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics  of  TNK-tPA  are  highly  consistent  across  animal  species  and  humans.  The  initial

volume of distribution of TNK-tPA (V

that  TNK-tPA  immediately  distributes  throughout  the  plasma  compartment  and,  over  time,  exhibits 
limited extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding.

Dose-independent  kinetics  were  observed  in  rats  over  the  range  of  doses  from  0.3 to  50  mg/kg. 
However,  in  beagle  dogs,  kinetics  appeared  to  be  dose-dependent  from  0.3  to  30  mg/kg.  At  a  dose 
level of 0.3 mg/kg, dogs have a TNK-tPA clearance similar to that in mice and rats (approximately 4 
to  5  ml/min/kg)  and  approximately  twice  that  observed  in  rabbits  and  monkeys  at  this  dose  level 
(2.0 to 2.4 ml/min/kg). Kinetics in humans were linear in the restricted dose range used in Phases II 
and III, but exhibited some nonlinearity over the wide dose range used in Phase I.  
Possible  effects  of  glycosylation  on  clearance  mechanism  of  TNK-tPA  were  investigated  in  rats. 
TNK-tPA, like tPA is a glycoprotein, but with differing oligosaccharide structures. Indirect evidence 
suggests that the hepatic mannose receptor, which is important for tPA elimination, is not involved in 
TNK-tPA elimination, as TNK-tPA does not contain high mannose oligosaccharide. The hepatic low-
density receptor related protein (LRP) could be involved in the clearance of both, TNK-tPA and tPA. 
Furthermore,  the  hepatic  asialoglycoprotein  receptor,  which  binds  terminal  galactose,  may  mediate 
TNK-tPA clearance. 
In  a  whole  body  autoradiography  study  conducted  in  rats  the  tissue  distribution  following  a  single 
intravenous  bolus  injection  of  TNK-tPA,  compared  to  t-PA.  was  assessed.  The  results  clearly 
demonstrated  that  the  liver  was  the  major  clearance  organ  for  both  [
I]tPA.  It 
appeared that TNK-tPA was distributed to similar tissues as tPA, but with different kinetics.

Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies in rats rabbits and dogs using up to 36 times the intended clinical dose of 
Metalyse  induced  no  effects  other  than  the  expected  pharmacological  changes  of  the  coagulation 
system, primarily characterised by a transient decrease of α2-antiplasmin and fibrinogen. 
Repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rats  and  dogs  with  daily  intravenous  doses  of 
Metalyse  for  two  weeks.  Toxicological  signs  were  related  to  the  exaggerated  pharmacodynamic 
properties of Metalyse, i.e. the fibrinolytic action (haemorrhages at the injection site). No test article-
related  intercurrent  deaths  or  unexpected  toxicity  occurred  at  doses  up  to  10  mg/kg,  as  long  as 
antibody-formation did not confound the toxicological evaluation. The pharmacodynamic changes of 
the  coagulation  system  observed  in  Metalyse-dosed  dogs  were  similar  in  timing  and  magnitude  to 
those produced by alteplase. 
Reproductive  toxicity  was  studied  in  the  rabbit  as  a  sensitive  species  during  the  period  of 
organogenesis. Because antibody towards Metalyse are detectable at day 7, the period of treatment in 
the main embryofetal development study was divided into three equal periods. In a preliminary study 
single  doses  of  5  mg/kg,  approximately  10  fold  the  clinical  dose,  did  not  show  any  bleeding 
complications  when  applied  on  either  day  14,  15,  16  or  17  of  pregnancy.  The  same  holds  true  for 
repeated  dosing  during  the  period  of  early  organogenesis  in  the  main  study.  Pregnant  Rabbits  of  all 
groups given Metalyse after gestation day 10, showed perivaginal bleeding, abortion and consecutive 
maternal  death,  with  a  high  incidence.  The  results  indicate  that  later  stages  of  embryofetal 
development  in  rabbits  appear  to  be  more  susceptible  than  earlier  stages.  Effects  of  Metalyse  on 
fertility  and  on  the  perinatal  and  postnatal  period  were  not  studied.  This  is  supported  by  the  short 
duration of exposure, the mechanism of action and available data of such studies for alteplase, which 
were considered to be representative for this group of substances. 
In conclusion, a comparison with other plasminogen activators shows that tenecteplase does not pose a 
higher  risk  to  pregnant  women  than  the  other  substances  of  this  group.  The  results  of  reproductive 
toxicity testing are expressed adequately in the SPC. 
Genotoxicity  and  carcinogenicity  studies  were  not  conducted.  This  is  justified  by  the  literature,  not 
describing  any  genotoxic  or  carcinogenic  potential  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator  as  well  as  the 
single dose administration to humans. 
Local  tolerance  studies  in  rabbits  and  rats  after  intravenous,  intraarterial  and  paravenous 
administration of Metalyse did not elicit irritation or bleeding at the injection site.

Objective 
Phase I single-dose study on 
pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety and 
tolerance of TNK-tPA in AMI 
Phase II randomised angiographic trial 
on patency of infarct related artery 
(IRA), TIMI flow, effects on 
coagulation factors, fibrinogenolysis 
and pharmacokinetics, with AMI 
within 12 hours of symptom onset. 
Phase II randomised trial on safety of 
TNK-tPA in AMI 
Phase III trial on mortality of a single-
bolus TNK-tPA vs. accelerated rt-PA 
in AMI 
The  clinical  pharmacology  of  TNK-tPA  was  investigated  in  TIMI  10A  and  TIMI  10B  studies 
involving 993 patients evaluating the pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic behaviour of the 
compound. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Data on coagulation and fibrinogenolysis were obtained during TIMI 10A study (n=79) and TIMI 10B 
study  (n=159)  in  patients  with  acute  myocardial  infarction,  treated  concomitantly  with  ASA  and 
heparin. 
The  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  TNK-tPA  in  TIMI  10A  study  were  assessed  by  measuring  the 
responses  of  coagulation  parameters  to  treatment  and  by  evaluating  patency  of  the  infarct  related 
artery  using  coronary  angiography.  TNK-tPA  showed  slight,  not  dose-dependent  decrease  of 
fibrinogen  and  plasminogen  levels  indicating  a  high  degree  of  fibrin  specificity.  Coagulation 
parameters indicate an increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation at both 1 hour and 3 hours 
after administration which was consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. 
In  TIMI  10B,  patency,  coagulation  parameters  as  well  as  pharmacokinetics  of  TNK-tPA  were 
investigated and compared with accelerated alteplase. The core coagulation laboratory data indicated 
that TNK-tPA had less impact on systemic clotting factors thanalteplase, i.e. was more fibrin specific 
than  alteplase  (e.g.  less  decrease  of  fibrinogen  and  plasminogen  levels).  Unlike  accelerated  rt-PA 
fibrinogen  levels  decreased  by  <  15%  and  plasminogen  decreased  by  <  25%  3  hours  after 
administration of TNK-tPA. Median levels of plasmin/α2-antiplasmin were affected 3-5 times less by 
TNK-tPA than byalteplase.  
TIMI  10B  confirmed  the  results  of  TIMI  10A  and  showed  comparable  results  of  the  coagulation 
parameters  for  the  30  mg,  40  mg  and  50  mg  dose  groups,  indicating  reproducible  and  consistent 
effects.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of TNK-tPA were studied in a total of 179 patients with acute myocardial infarction 
during the TIMI 10A (n=80) and TIMI 10B (n=99) trials. Comparative data with rt-PA were obtained 
in additional 53 patients. All formulations administered to patients consisted of a powder and solvent

(sterile  water)  for  solution  for  injection  (for  intravenous  use).  The  pharmacokinetic  parameters 
indicated a dose-related increase in the TNK-tPA concentrations following i.v. bolus administration.  
In TIMI 10A the concentration decreased in a biphasic manner following a bolus injection of TNK-
tPA. The initial phase had a half-life of 11-20 minutes and the terminal phase had a half-life of 41-138 
minutes for doses of 5-50 mg. The mean plasma clearance of TNK-tPA across the doses of 5-50 mg 
was  151  ml/min,  ranging  from  216  ml/min  at  a  dose  of  5  mg  to  125  ml/min  at  a  dose  of  50  mg, 
indicating  moderate  non-linear  pharmacokinetics  in  the  lower  dose  range.  The  plasma  clearance  of 
TNK-tPA  was  2- to  4-fold slower  than  that reported  for rt-PA. The initial  volume  of distribution  of 
TNK-tPA approximated the plasma volume.These PK results indicated that TNK-tPA administered as 
a bolus should result in a plasma concentration profile similar to that of the 90-minute accelerated rt-
PA infusion.  
In  the  TIMI  10  B,  the  determined  PK  parameters  showed  that  the  average  maximum  TNK-tPA 
plasma  concentration  (Cmax)  is  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner  (7.52-11.6  µg/ml)  following 
i.v. bolus administration in the 30 - 50 mg dose range. The initial volume of distribution (V1) ranged 
from 4.2 to 5.4 litres, approximating plasma volume, and was highly variable. The steady-state volume 
of  distribution  (Vss)  ranged  from  6.1  -  8  L  and  was  slightly  larger  than  V1,  suggestive  of  some 
extravascular distribution or tissue binding. The mean residence time in the body was approximately 1 
hour. The plasma clearance (CL) was approximately 100 ml/min and was similar for the 30-, 40- and 
50  mg  doses.  TNK-tPA  has  a  4-  to  5-fold  slower  plasma  clearance  compared  to  alteplase  (453 
ml/min).  Following a bolus dose the  plasma  concentrations in  most subjects  decreased in a biphasic 
manner.  The  initial  and  terminal  phase  half-lives  were  approximately  22  and  90-129  minutes 
respectively. 
The  TIMI  10B  study  showed  comparable  results  to  TIMI  10A.  In  the  group  of  patients  for  which 
complete  PK  and  demographic  data  (e.g.  age,  weight,  sex)  were  available  (n=96),  data  showed  that 
plasma clearance increased with increasing weight and decreasing age (weight accounted for 19% of 
the variability in plasma clearance of TNK-tPA).  
The  PK  data  of  TNK-tPA  differed  from  those  of  alteplase  (longer  half-life,  approx.  4-fold  slower 
plasma clearance, approx. 2-fold greater plasma exposure according to AUC) and support the intended 
single bolus administration.  
formal 
interaction  studies  have  been  performed 
to  evaluate  pharmacodynamic  and 
No 
pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  TNK-tPA  and  other  drugs  commonly  administered  for  the 
treatment  of  AMI  (e.g.  nitrates,  heparin,  platelet  inhibitors,  ß-blockers,  ACE-inhibitors,  etc.).  No 
clinical trials were performed to investigate the pharmacokinetics (and Pharmacodynamics) of TNK-
tPA in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. 
Clinical efficacy 
In total 12,364 patients were exposed to TNK-tPA  in the submitted phase II and III clinical studies. 
The  phase  II  programme  included  more  than  4,000  patients  and  more  than  3,700  of  them  received 
TNK-tPA  (582  patients  were  treated  between  6  to  12  hours).  The  phase  III  study  was  conducted  in 
approx.  17,000  patients.  The  active  comparator  in  the  clinical  trial  programme  wasalteplase, 
administered as the accelerated regimen. 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Dose response studies 
The dose-response relationship was investigated in three trials including a total of 4228 patients with 
AMI up to 12 hours from symptoms onset.  
In TIMI 10 A, 113 patients (< 70 years) with ST-segment elevation AMI presenting within 12 hours 
after symptom onset were treated with a single intravenous bolus of TNK-tPA over 5-10 seconds in a 
dose  of  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  15  mg,  20  mg,  30  mg,  40  mg  and  50  mg.  The  patients  received 
concomitantly  ASA  (325  mg),  and  unfractionated  heparin  (i.v.  bolus  of  5000  U,  followed  by  an 
infusion at 1000 U/hour for 48-72 hours, adjusted to maintain an aPTT of 55-85 seconds). Endpoints 
included  the  effect  on  coagulation  parameters,  evaluation  of  PK,  angiographic  assessment  by  TIMI 
grade flow, TIMI frame count, to quantify coronary flow objectively, and safety.

The  percentage  of  patients  achieving  TIMI  grade  3  flow  at  90  minutes  in  the  infarct  related  artery 
(IRA) was higher in patients treated with doses of 30, 40 and 50 mg as compared with lower doses. 
Statistical differences in the 30 mg, 40 mg and 50 mg doses were not apparent in this small trial. 
Based on this pilot data and assuming a plateau-like effect of TIMI grade 3 flow from the 30 mg dose, 
the  doses  of  30  mg  and  50  mg  were  selected  for  the  subsequent  phase  II  studies  (TIMI  10B  and 
ASSENT-I). 
In  the  TIMI  10B  study  (March  1996-April  1997)  the  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the 
percentage of subjects with TIMI grade 3 flow in the IRA 90 minutes after the start of treatment with 
bolus TNK-tPA compared with acceleratedalteplase. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of 
the  effects  of  TNK-tPA  on  coagulation  factors  and  fibrinogenolysis  as  well  as  the  evaluation  of  the 
pharmacokinetics  (as  described  in  previous  sections),  safety  and  clinical  efficacy  of  TNK-tPA. 
Moreover,  the  reocclusion  rate  at  18-36  hours  after  treatment  initiation  and  of  the  formation  of 
antibodies against TNK-tPA were to be evaluated. 
Initially this trial was designed to evaluate coronary patency rates with 2 doses of TNK-tPA (30 mg 
and  50  mg),  administered  as  i.v.  bolus  injections  over  5-10  seconds  as  compared  to  a    90-minute 
accelerated infusion regimen of alteplase. In September 1996, the initial phase of the recruitment, the 
study  protocol  was  amended  (discontinuation  of  the  50  mg  dose  and  replacement  with  40  mg  dose, 
adjustment  of  heparin  dose,  and  age  limit  of  80  years  as  an  inclusion  criterion)  following 
recommendation  of  the  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  because  3  patients  experienced  intracranial 
haemorrhage (3/78).   
Study  population:  880  patients  presenting  with  AMI  were  enrolled  in  this  study  and  877  were 
randomised.  In  general,  patients  were  comparable  across  treatment  groups  with  respect  to 
demographic  and  baseline  characteristics.  The  mean  time  for  MI  symptom  onset  to  study  drug 
initiation  was  3.5  hours.  Approximately  87%  of  patients  were  treated  within  6  hours  of  symptom 
onset. The percentage of patients with >6 hours to 12 hours time from symptom onset to study drug 
initiation ranged from 11.6-13.2% in the different treatment groups. 
The comparator treatment alteplase was administered as an accelerated, 90 minutes infusion regimen. 
Concomitant medication: 
ASA (150 mg -325 mg, p.o.) and i.v. heparin were given concomitantly, beginning at study entry.  
A  total  of  362  patients  was  recruited  before  the  (September  1996)  protocol  amendment  mandating 
changes in heparin dosing and 518 patients were recruited thereafter. In addition, the company showed 
that  the  initial  heparin  use  was  comparable  between  the  treatment  groups.    Other  important 
concomitant  medications  were  ß-blockers,  calcium  antagonists,  nitrates  and  ACE-inhibitors  with  no 
relevant differences between treatment groups. 
Results: 
With regard to the primary endpoint TIMI grade 3 flow in the IRA 90  minutes the only statistically 
significant result was 30 mg TNK-tPA versus alteplase with a lower percentage of patients with TIMI 
grade 3 flow in the patients with 30 mg TNK-tPA (p=0.035).

In general, a shorter duration of time from symptom onset to treatment was associated with a higher 
percentage  of  subjects  with  TIMI  grade  3  flow.  It  seems  to  be  appropriate  to  use  the  conclusions 
drawn from the overall study as the basis for the justification of the dose regimen for the investigated 
patient population in the pivotal trial (AMI patients within 6 hours of symptom onset). 
Furthermore,  additional  exploratory  analyses  -  not  pre-specified  in  the  study  protocol  -  were 
conducted  to  evaluate  the  relationship  between  weight-adjusted  dose,  TIMI  grade  flow,  and  TIMI 
frame counts. 
A  logistic  regression  model  (Cox  proportional  hazard  model)  was  used  with  TIMI  grade  as  the 
dependent variables. 
Significant  predictors  for  TIMI  grade  3  flow  were  log  (dose/weight),  age  and  infarct  location.  The 
percentage of patients with TIMI grade 3 flow seemed to increase with increasing dose per weight.  
Furthermore, TIMI grade 3 flow after 90 minutes was assessed relative to systemic exposure of TNK-
tPA over the first  90  minutes (AUC2-90)  showing  a trend toward  an increased  percentage  of patients 
who achieved TIMI grade 3 flow when AUC was greater.    
In  the  safety  study  ASSENT  I  an  exploratory  analysis  showed  that  mortality  was  directly  related  to 
dose/weight and, independently, inversely related to weight (i.e. an increase in dose/weight as well as 
a decrease in weight resulted in increased mortality). 
It was determined on the basis of and integrated analysis of Phase I and Phase II data that the optimal 
regimen for TNK-tPA should be a weight-adjusted dose of approximately 0.53 mg/kg.  
Main study 
The  ASSENT-II  Study  was  conducted  to  demonstrate  efficacy  and  safety  in  patients  with  acute 
myocardial  infarction. This trial  started on  October 21,  1997, involving  29 countries (1,022  centres) 
and the enrolment of 17,005 patients was completed by December 29, 1998. 
Study design: 
The  ASSENT-II  Study  is  a  multicentre,  randomised,  rt-PA-controlled,  double-blind,  double-dummy 
study  in  patients  with  AMI  presenting  within  6  hours  of  symptom  onset.  The  patients  were  either 
treated with a bolus of TNK-tPA or the accelerated regimen of alteplase. 
Patients 18 years and older who presented acute (≤ 6 hours) symptoms and prespecified ECG signs of 
myocardial infarction were included. 
Dose  regimens:  The  dose  of  TNK-tPA  was  a  weight-adjusted  rapid  intravenous  bolus  over  5-10 
seconds. 
Subject weight 
TNK-tPA dose 
< 60 kg 
≥ 60 kg and <70 kg

≥ 90 kg 
   30 mg 
   35 mg 
   40 mg 
   45 mg 
   50 mg 
The accelerated dose regimen of the comparator alteplase was also weight-adjusted (not to exceed 100 
mg). For patients weighing:  
>  67  kg:  15  mg  as  an  IV  bolus,  followed  by  50  mg  infused  over  the  first  30  minutes,  then  35  mg 
infused over the next 60 minutes. 
≤  67  kg:  15  mg  as  an  IV  bolus,  followed  by  0.75  mg/kg  infused  over  the  first  30  minutes  not 
exceeding 50 mg, then 0.50 mg/kg up to 35 mg infused over the next 60 minutes, not to exceed 35 mg. 
10/22 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Concomitant therapy: 
ASA (150 – 325 mg) immediately upon study entry. Alternatively, if the patient was unable to ingest 
tablets,  an  initial  dose  of  100-250  mg  ASA  may  have  been  given  intravenously  (in  countries  where 
this regimen is approved). Patients who had taken ASA within 12 hours before randomisation started 
ASA the next day. 
Heparin was administered on a weight-adjusted basis as soon as possible after study entry for 48-72 
hours. 
For patients weighing ≤ 67 kg: 4000 U as bolus, 800 U/hour initial infusion rate 
For patients weighing > 67 kg: 5000 U as bolus, 1000 U/hour initial infusion rate 
The heparin infusion was adjusted to maintain an aPTT of 50-75 seconds. 
The use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists was discouraged during the first 24 hours after randomisation.  
The  primary  efficacy  objective  was  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  in  30-day  mortality 
between the TNK-tPA and alteplase dose regimens. 
Secondary efficacy objectives: 
• “net clinical” benefit, defined as the absence of mortality and non-fatal stroke at 30 days. 
•the rate of the following non-fatal major cardiac in-hospital events: 
  Recurrent MI, sustained hypotension, occurrence of pulmonary oedema and/or cardiogenic shock, major 
arrhythmias, invasive cardiac procedures, pericarditis, acute mitral regurgitation, pulmonary embolism, and 
tamponade 
• 30-day mortality and net clinical benefit at 30 days according to age (≤ 75 y vs. > 75 y), time to 
treatment (0-2 hrs, >2-4 hrs, >4 hrs), infarct location (anterior vs. non- anterior) and history of previous MI 
(yes vs. no) 
Statistical analysis 
The  primary  endpoint  (30-day  mortality)  was  defined  as  death  at  or  before  30  days  after 
randomisation/enrolment.  The  upper  bound  of  the  two-sided  90  %  confidence  intervals  for  the 
absolute difference and the relative risk between the TNK-tPA and accelerated alteplase groups was 
used to demonstrate a clinical equivalence of 30-day mortality between the two treatment groups by 
showing  that  the  30-day  mortality  after  TNK-tPA  does  not  exceed  the  30-day  mortality  after 
accelerated alteplase by more than 1 % or that the relative risk in 30-day mortality after TNK-tPA over 
accelerated alteplase does not exceed 14 %, whichever is smallest. 
Three different analyses were performed for this trial: intent-to-treat, as treated, and randomised and 
treated.  The  protocol  specified  that  the  primary  analysis  of  this  study  was  to  be  performed  on  the 
intent-to-treat population. Therefore, efficacy and safety results are presented for this population only. 
The efficacy analysis of the intent-to-treat population included five prespecified covariates: age, Killip 
class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and infarct location. 
Study populations/accountability of patients 
(b) 
From  21  October  1997  to  29  November  1998,  17,005  patients  were  enrolled  at  1,022  sites  in  29 
countries. Out of the 17,005 patients enrolled, 16,949 were randomised: 8,461 patients to TNK-TPA 
and 8,488 to alteplase. 445 patients were randomised but did not receive study drug (236 in the TNK-
tPA and 209 in the alteplase group).  
There were 16,557 patients in the as-treated population: 16,504 subjects were randomised according to 
baseline characteristics (e.g. sex, age, weights, medical history) and treated and 53 subjects were not 
randomised  but  treated.  The  analyses  of  this  population  were  performed  according  to  the  treatment 
actually  received.  Of  the  16,949  intent-to-treat  patients,  16,943  (99.96  %)  completed  the  30-day 
follow-up.  There  was  no  significant  difference  between  the  two  treatment  groups  with  respect  to 
baseline  variables  and  medical  history,  being  in  addition  very  similar  to  the  baseline  characteristics 
recorded in previous thrombolytic studies such as GUSTO I and GUSTO III.

(*) Covariates used are age, infarct location, Killipp class, SBP and heart rate 
Therapeutic equivalence could be demonstrated on the basis of the prespecified limit of 14 % for the 
relative risk and the prespecified boundary of 1 % for the absolute difference in all-cause mortality up 
to 30 days after initiation of study drug. The primary analysis as well as the additional analyses show 
similar results. According to the ICH 9 Guideline, the additionally calculated upper limit of the 95% 
CI  for  the  nonparametric  adjusted  relative  risk  ratio  (primary  analysis)  was  1.124  and  thus,  non-
inferiority with respect to the non-inferiority margin of 14% can be concluded. 
The  mortality  rates  found  in  ASSENT  II  (approx.  6.2  %  for  both  TNK-tPA  and  alteplase)  are 
comparable to those of accelerated rt-PA in GUSTO I (6.3 %).

The incidence of death or nonfatal stroke tended to be slightly higher in the TNK-tPA group compared 
to thealteplase group (7.11% vs 7.04%). 
In-Hospital Events 
During the in-hospital phase of the study, no significant difference between the two treatment groups 
was  seen regarding reinfarction, sustained  hypotension,  pulmonary edema,  cardiogenic  shock,  major 
arrthythmias,  pericarditis,  acute  mitral  regurgitation,  pulmonary  embolism,  or  tamponade.  The 
incidence  of  invasive  cardiac  procedures  during  the  in-hospital  phase  was  similar  in  both  treatment 
groups for PTCA, stent placement, and IABP.  
Additional In-Hospital Events (Exploratory Variables) 
No  significant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  were  seen  for  “death  or  non-fatal  ICH”, 
“death  or  nonfatal  disabling  stroke”,  “death  or  non-fatal  disabling  ICH”,  recurrent  angina,  acute 
ventricular septal defect, or TIA. Anaphylaxis occurred in 6 patients (0.07%) of the TNK-tPA group 
and  in  16  patients  (0.19%)  of  the  alteplase  group  (p=0.0523).  Anaphylaxis  was  considered  possibly 
related to study drug in 1 out of 6 patients treated with TNK-tPA and in 8 out of 16 patients treated 
with alteplase.  
In  the  TNK-tPA  group  more  patients  were  in  Killip  Class  I  than  in  the  alteplase  group  (93.91%  vs. 
93.03%, p=0.0255). In the TNK-tPA group fewer patients were in Killip Class IV than in the alteplase 
group (2.07% vs. 2.58%, p=0.032). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to 
patients presenting Killip Class II or Class III. 
Conclusion on the efficacy results:   
The  intent-to-treat  analysis  (relative  risk)  demonstrated  therapeutic  equivalence  for  TNK-tPA  and 
alteplase  in  30-day  mortality.  The  mortality  rate  of  6.2  %  in  both  groups  corresponds  to  that  of 
alteplase  in  the  GUSTO-I  study  (6.3  %,  30-day  outcome).  Risk  groups  have  been  identified  and 
addressed in the SPC.

Clinical safety 
Antibody formation: 
Results of antibody formation were available for 543 TNK-tPA treated patients (at 30 days) in TIMI 
10B. One patient had a positive titer antibody test, which was subsequently negative at 90 days. The 
observed titers were low and close to the detection limit of the assay.  
This was in accordance to the respective data in TIMI 10A.  Overall, the data on antibody formation 
that TNK-tPA does not seem to induce antibody formation. 
Safety study ASSENT I 
ASSENT I (Assessment of the safety of a new thrombolytic: TNK-tPA) was a randomised open-label 
uncontrolled safety study and included 3235 patients ≥ 18 years of age with AMI within 12 hours from 
symptom  onset.  This  trial  was  performed  at  the  same  time  as  TIMI  10B  and  although  there  was  no 
formal protocol amendment for this trial, the changes recommended by the DSMB (e.g. regarding the 
concomitant heparin dosage) were implemented at the same time that TIMI 10B was amended. In this 
study the dose regimen was not weight-adjusted and the patients were treated with fixed doses of 30, 
40 or 50 mg TNK-tPA. 
The  primary objective was to evaluate the overall safety profile of TNK-tPA and the  primary target 
variable was the rate of intracranial haemorrhages (ICH). Secondary target criteria were rates of death, 
total  stroke  (haemorrhagic  and  non-haemorrhagic),  recurrent  MI,  cardiac  revascularisation, 
cardiogenic shock, anaphylaxis, pulmonary oedema, and serious, life-threatening bleeding and the rate 
of  death  plus  nonfatal  strokes.  Stroke  events  were  reviewed  by  an  Event  Review  Committee  which 
classified events as ICHs or non-ICHs. 
The  study  population  consisted  of  patients  ≥  18  years  with  AMI  who  presented  within  12  hours  of 
symptom onset.

The mean time from symptom onset to treatment was 3.8 hours. 16% of patients were treated >6 hours 
from symptom onset (30 mg: 14.8%, 40 mg: 17.1%, 50 mg: 21.9%). 
Concomitant  therapy:  Patients  were  to  be  treated  with  150-325  mg  of  oral  ASA  once  daily 
(alternatively, an initial i.v. dose of 100-250 mg ASA was acceptable). Patients who had taken ASA 
within 24 hours prior to randomisation were to start ASA the next day. 
Intravenous heparin was administered as soon as possible after study entry. Other medications (e.g. ß-
blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, nitrates, etc.) were used at the discretion of the treating 
physician.  There  were  no  relevant  differences  seen  between  the  study  groups  regarding  important 
comedication. 
Results: 
A  total  of  25  patients  experienced  an  intracerebral  haemorrhage  (ICH)  within  30  days  post 
treatment (0.9% in the 30 mg group, 0.6% in the 40 mg group and none in the 50 mg group). In both 
treatment  groups  patients  with  time  to  treatment  of  0-6  hours  had  a  lower  rate  of  ICH  (0.6%)  as 
compared to patients with time to treatment > 6 hours (1.2%). Furthermore, the ICH rates tended to be 
lower after the protocol change time point: they were 1.6% before and 0.8% after the amendment in 
the 30 mg TNK-tPA group. 
In addition, after the September 1996 protocol change the event rates were lower for the 30 mg group 
also for death (6.5% vs. 8.9%), death or non-fatal stroke (7.5% vs. 9.7%), serious bleeding (2.7% vs. 
3.2%) and total stroke (1.4% vs. 2.4%).

There  were  no  significant  differences  regarding  the  rates  of  death,  total  stroke,  pulmonary  oedema, 
cardiogenic shock, and anaphylaxis among the treatment groups. Fewer re-infarctions within 30 days 
occurred in the 40 mg TNK-tPA group compared with the 30 mg TNK-tPA group (5.9% vs. 8.2%, not

The rate of death or non-fatal stroke was not different across the treatment groups. 
A  total  of  90  out  of  3235  patients  (2.8%)  had  at  least  one  serious  bleeding  event  (2.8%,  2.7%  and 
4.1% in the 30, 40 and 50 mg groups, respectively).  
The majority of bleedings were non-instrumented site bleedings (86.2%). 43.6% of these events were 
probably related, and 27.7% were possibly related to the study drug.  
At  least  one  non-serious  bleeding  event  (most  frequently  haemorrhage  at  the  injection-site  or  at  the 
catheter site, ecchymosis, epistaxis, haematuria) was reported in 32.9% of the patients (31.4%, 33.8% 
and 47.9% in the 30, 40 and 50 mg groups, respectively).  
The percentage  of patients experiencing at least one serious non-bleeding adverse event was 26.4%, 
25.4% and 26.0% in the 30, 40 and 50 mg groups, respectively. 
80-90% of all patients reported at least one non-serious, non-bleeding adverse event.  
Platelet  counts  decreased  in  13-15%  of  all  patients  at  24-48  hours  after  initiation  of  study  drug  but 
returned to baseline levels at hospital discharge.

(*) Including haemorrhagic conversion 
The incidence of total stroke tended to be higher in the TNK-tPA group (1.78 %) than in the alteplase 
group  (1.66  %).  The  incidence  of  total  stroke  is  consistent  with  the  incidence  observed  in  previous 
large-scale  mortality studies, particularly for alteplase: 1.55  % in  GUSTO  I,  and 1.79  %  in  GUSTO 
III. Primary ICHs occurred in 0.93 % of patients in the TNK-tPA group and 0.94 % of patients in the 
alteplase group, being virtually identical. When compared with the ICH rates in the accelerated rt-PA 
group in GUSTO I (0.72 %), GUSTO III (0.87 %), and COBALT (0.8 %), the rate for alteplase and 
TNK-tPA  in  ASSENT-II  was  slightly  higher.  This  increase  may  be  due  to  a  better  detection  due  to 
brain imaging. Another reason might be that the study did not have an upper age limit.

In  subgroups  results,  the  stroke  rates,  both  total  and  ICHs,  are  higher  in  patients  with  a  low  body 
weight.  These  findings  apply  to  both  treatments  and  are  in  line  with  the  results  of  the  weight-
subgroups for 30-day mortality. However, the total stroke and primary ICH rates tended to be higher 
in the alteplase group compared to the TNK-tPA group in patients with a low body weight. 
A reason for the increased stroke rates in patients with low body weight might be the inclusion of risk 
groups in the low weight subgroup such as elderly or (light weight) females.

Significantly fewer major bleeding events occurred in the TNK-tPA group than in the alteplase group 
(p=0.0002). The difference in total bleeding events was also statistically significant (p=0.0003).  
The  site  of  major  bleeding  was  most  commonly  identified  by  investigators  as  haematoma,  and  next 
common  was  gastrointestinal  tract  bleeding,  regardles  of  which  thrombolytic  was  used.  Bruises, 
catheter  site  bleeding,  and  unspecified  bleeding  site  made  up  the  majority  of  the  remaining  major 
bleeds in both treatment groups. 
Overall,  about  95  %  of  the  enrolled  patients  did  not  need  blood  transfusions  during  the  in-hospital 
period.  Significantly  fewer  patients  treated  with  TNK-tPA  needed  blood  transfusions  than  patients 
treated with alteplase (p=0.0113). 
In all body weight classes, there was less bleeding in the TNK-tPA group compared to the alteplase 
group. These differences were statistically significant for the subgroups < 60 kg and between 60 and 
70 kg. As already seen for the mortality and stroke results the number of patients with bleedings was 
higher in patients with low body weight. However, the difference was not as pronounced as seen for 
the mortality and stroke results.  
Overall adverse events 
d) 
Overall,  6305  patients  (74.5  %)  in  the  TNK-tPA  group  and  6406  patients  (75.5  %)  in  the  alteplase 
group experienced adverse events.  
Adverse  events  classified  by  organ  system  class  included:  application-site  disorders  (1.4  %  in  both 
groups); cardiovascular disorders (general) (21 % in both groups); heart rate and rhythm disorders (42 
%  in  both  groups);  liver  and  biliary  system  disorders  (TNK-tPA  0.3  %,  alteplase  0.4  %);  metabolic 
and nutritional disorders (TNK-tPA 3.4 %, alteplase 3.9 %); platelet, bleeding, and clotting disorders 
(TNK-tPA 23.5 %, alteplase 25.4 %); respiratory symptom disorders (TNK-tPA 15.6 %, alteplase 16.2 
%); urinary system disorders (TNK-tPA 7.7 %, alteplase 8.8 %).  
The number of anaphylactic reactions was 6 under TNK-tPA and 16 under alteplase.

The events were mainly cardiac failure and hypotension. There was no difference between TNK-tPA 
and alteplase.  
Causes of Deaths 
f) 
During  ASSENT-II,  a  total  of  1045  patients  died,  940  during  the  in-hospital  phase  and  105  after 
discharge until Day 30. 
The  cause  of death is  available for 938 out  of  940  patients (99.8%) who  died during  the  in-hospital 
period.  The  table  below  shows  the  causes  of  death,  by  classes,  of  patients  who  died  in-hospital

Not unexpectedly, the in-hospital causes of death are mainly due the acute myocardial infarction and 
haemorrhagic stroke. These in-hospital causes of death are consistent both in nature and percentages 
with the 30 day phase II ASSENT-I safety trial.  
The  death  rate  and  time  to  death  were  virtually  identical,  and  causes  of  death  were  very  similar  for 
TNK-tPA treated patients as compared to those treated with alteplase. 
ECG 
g) 
In  a  relatively  small  number  of  cases  the  investigator  determined  an  ECG  finding  to  represent  an 
adverse event, and reported the ECG interpretation along with the rest of the AE information: 35 cases 
on  TNK-tPA,  and  27  cases  on  alteplase.    Of  these  events,  for  both  treatment  groups  approximately 
two-thirds (24/35 on TNK-tPA and 18/27 on alteplase) were related to ST segment changes (elevation 
or depression). Eight were deemed SAEs in TNK-tPA treated patients, as were 5 events in alteplase 
treated patients.   
TNK-tPA does not increase the incidence of ECG-related adverse events in comparison to alteplase.  
Conclusion on the safety results: 
The  safety  of  TNK-tPA  and  alteplase  in  the  ASSENT-II  study  was  comparable  with  respect  to  the 
incidence  of  ICH  (0.93  %  vs.  0.94  %).  TNK-tPA  does  not  increase  the  risk  of  stroke    (1.78%  vs 
1.65%). The stroke rates, both total and ICH, were higher in patients with a low body weight in both 
treatment groups which is in line with the results seen for 30-day mortality. The death rate and time to 
death  were  virtually  identical,  and  causes  of  death  were  similar  for  TNK-tPA  treated  patients  as 
compared to those treated with alteplase. 
There were significantly fewer subjects with bleeding events, and blood transfusions in the TNK-tPA 
group  compared  with  the  alteplase  group.  Major  bleeds  occurred  less  frequently  in  patients  treated 
with TNK-tPA than in those treated with alteplase (4.7% vs. 5.9%, p=0.0002).

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
In general  the  substance  is  well characterised and  the consistency of the product  and the  production 
process is deemed sufficient. The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to 
the  uniform  clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a 
satisfactory way. 
Viral  Safety  and  batch  consistency  have  been  documented  and  the  relevant  tests  will  be  performed 
according to the agreed specifications. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  tenecteplase  induced  clot  lysis 
activity  in  human  plasma  as  well  as  in  various  animal  models.  An  increased  fibrin  specificity  was 
demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies. 
Safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
changes  of  the  ECG,  but  this  occurred  at  multiple  exposures  that  were  considerably  higher  than  the 
clinical  exposure.  Pharmacokinetic  data  showed  that  animals  exhibit  a  reduction  in  clearance  of 
tenecteplase relative to t-PA that is closely similar to that observed in humans, and a close similarity 
of other important pharmacokinetic parameters to humans. 
Single and multiple dose toxicity studies in various animal species demonstrated dose dependant and 
reversible  alterations  of  the  coagulation  parameters  with  local  haemorrhages  at  the  injection  site, 
which was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. With regard to 
the indication and single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity testing was restricted to 
embryo foetal development in rabbits, as highly sensitive species. Most likely after repeated dosing at 
later gestation stages, pregnant rabbits showed bleeding and abortion with consecutive maternal death.

From these data it can be concluded that treatment with tenecteplase will subject pregnant women to 
an  increased  risk  as  compared  to  non  pregnant  women  due  to  bleeding  complications  that  are  most 
likely of placental origin. In addition, the continuation of the pregnancy could be at risk during certain 
susceptible phases. However, a comparison with other plasminogen activators shows that tenecteplase 
does not pose a higher risk to pregnant women than other substances of this group. 
Efficacy 
The  pharmacodynamic  properties  relevant  to  the  indication  sought  for  have  been  sufficiently 
evaluated. Study results concerning haemostasis and fibrinolysis parameters showed good consistency 
through the studies. The fibrin specificity of TNK-tPA is higher than that of alteplase.  
to  AUC)  and  support 
Adequate pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
The results of pharmacokinetic studies were sufficiently consistent. The PK data of TNK-tPA differed 
from those of alteplase (longer half life, approx. 4-fold slower plasma clearance, 2-fold greater plasma 
intended  single  bolus  administration.  No

pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with renal or liver impairment. Even though 
laboratory  data  with  respect  to  renal  and  hepatic  function  were  not  collected  systematically,  the 
ASSENT-II study revealed no differences between TNK-tPA and alteplase with respect to the adverse 
events linked to the system organ classification for the kidney and biliary system/liver. Nevertheless, 
due to the fact that TNK-tPA is metabolised by the liver, it is appropriate to consider severe hepatic 
impairment as a contra-indication to TNK-tPA treatment, as already mentioned in the SPC. 
No  clinical  studies  were  aimed  specifically  at  interactions  between  TNK-tPA  and  other  medicinal 
drugs. However, in view of the relatively large data base of patients in the ASSENT-II study, grouped 
according to the concomitant medications, the conclusion of the Applicant that no relevant differences 
between TNK-tPA and alteplase can be detected regarding major clinical outcomes can be accepted. 
Dose-finding  was  performed  in  three  studies:  two  angiographic  studies  (TIMI  10A,  TIMI  10B)  and 
one  safety  study  (ASSENT-I).  In  these  trials  a  total  of  4228  patients  with  AMI  were  included.  The 
TIMI  flow  and  TIMI  frame  count  data  indicate  that  there  are  dose-related  effects  of  TNK-tPA.  The 
percentage of patients with TIMI grade 3 flow and TIMI grade 2 or 3 flow at 90 minutes appeared to 
increase  with  increasing  dose  of  TNK-tPA.  The  30  mg  dose  appeared  to  be  less  effective  than  the 
other doses and was significantly less effective than alteplase in achieving higher grades of TIMI flow. 
The 40 and 50 mg doses were comparable to alteplase. 
The risk of serious bleeding events is related to the dose of TNK-tPA. 
The open uncontrolled safety study (ASSENT-I) shows no statistically significant differences between 
the  dose  regimens  (30  mg,  40  mg  and  50  mg)  with  respect  to  ICH  rate,  death,  non-fatal  stroke  or 
death, and serious bleeding. Mortality tended to decrease with increasing dose. The dose selection for 
the phase  III trial was  mainly based on results and additional  exploratory analyses of  the  TIMI 10B 
study,  taking  into  account  the  safety  data  of  ASSENT-I.  It  was  shown,  that  the  factors  body  weight 
and dose per weight are predictors of TIMI grade 3 flow. In a subset of patients TIMI grade 3 flow 
tended  to  increase  with  increased  systemic  exposure  of  TNK-tPA.  Since  pharmacokinetic  analyses 
demonstrated  that  patient's  body  weight  influenced  the  plasma  clearance  of  TNK-tPA  and 
consequently the systemic exposure, it was concluded to use a weight-adjusted dose of TNK-tPA in 
order to achieve a systemic exposure which should result in a greater likelihood of TIMI grade 3 flow. 
Moreover,  the  fact  that  no  specific  safety  problems  arose  in  the  large-scale  phase  III  trial  the 
recomendation  of  the  proposed  weight-adjusted  dose  regimen  is  acceptable,  although  not  formally 
studied in phase II. 
Efficacy was investigated in one pivotal confirmatory study (ASSENT-II). A total of 17,005 patients 
was  exposed to TNK-tPA or to the comparator alteplase. Both dose regimens were weight-adjusted. 
Therapeutic equivalence could be demonstrated as predefined in the study protocol regarding 30-day 
mortality  between  a  single  bolus  regimen  of  TNK-tPA  and  accelerated-infusion  of  alteplase.  The 
mortality rates found in ASSENT-II (6.2 % in both groups) are comparable to those of accelerated rt-
PA in GUSTO-I (6.3 %).  
In summary, the results of the submitted clinical trials support the approved indication.

Safety 
The safety profile of TNK-tPA in the weight-adjusted regimen compared to alteplase was investigated 
in  particular  in  the  ASSENT-II  study.  The  incidence  of  ICH  was  comparable  in  the  two  treatment 
groups (0.93 % vs. 0.94 %). TNK-tPA does not increase the risk of stroke and ICH. The stroke rates, 
both total and ICH, were higher in patients with a low body weight in both treatment groups which is 
in line with the results seen for 30-day mortality.  
The death rate and time to death were virtually identical, and causes of death were similar for TNK-
tPA  treated  patients  as  compared  to  those  treated  with  alteplase.  There  were  significantly  fewer 
subjects  with  bleeding  events  and  blood  transfusions  in  the  TNK-tPA  group  compared  with  the 
alteplase group. Major bleeds occurred less frequently in patients treated with TNK-tPA than in those 
treated with alteplase (4.7% vs. 5.9%, p=0.0002).  
Thus,  the  safety  profile  compared  to  alteplase  seems  to  be  in  favour  of  TNK-tPA.  No  clinical 
circumstances have been identified where there is an excess risk attributable to TNK-tPA. Risk groups 
were identified and considered in the SPC. 
There  was  no  report  of  serious  drug-related  convulsions.  Since  convulsions  are  seen  with  other 
thrombolytic agents, a cumulative review of cases should be provided in the next PSUR to assess the 
risk of convulsions in patients receiving TNK-tPA. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Metalyse  was  favourable.  Therefore,  the  CPMP  recommended  the 
granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  for  Metalyse  indicated  for  the  thrombolytic  treatment  of 
suspected  myocardial  infarction  with  persistent  ST  elevation  or  recent  left  Bundle  Branch  Block 
within 6 hours after the onset of AMI symptoms.

Post authorisation  
In November 2001 the MAH informed the EMEA of 4 cases involving Metalyse which suggested that 
the  instructions  for  use  of  the  product  may  not  have  been  followed  appropriately.  It  was  decided  to 
change the instructions for use and handling in the SPC and labelling by means of an Urgent Safety 
Restriction. The MAH subsequently sent a letter to healthcare professionals followed the publication 
of a statement on the EMEA website. 
Adverse Drug reactions 
Death and permanent disability have been reported in patients who have experienced stroke (including 
intracranial bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes. 
Isolated  events  related  to  the  nervous  system  (e.g.  somnolence,  aphasia,  convulsion)  have  been 
reported.  Ischaemic  or  haemorrhagic  cerebrovascular  events  may  be  contributing  or  underlying 
conditions. 
In  January  2004  the  contraindication  in  diabetic  patients  (section  4.3  of  the  SPC)  was  deleted 
following  the  publication  of  a  CPMP  position  statement  concerning  the  use  of  iv  fibrinolytics  in 
diabetic patients. In addition, the term eye haemorrhage was aded to section 4.8 of the SPC.

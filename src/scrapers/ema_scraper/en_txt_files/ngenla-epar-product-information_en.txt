CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ngenla is indicated for the treatment of children and adolescents from 3 years of age with growth 
disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and monitored by physicians who are qualified and experienced in the 
diagnosis and management of paediatric patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 0.66 mg/kg body weight administered once weekly by subcutaneous 
injection.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Each pre-filled pen is capable of setting and delivering the dose prescribed by the physician. Dose may 
be rounded up or down based on the physician’s expert knowledge of the individual patient needs. 
When doses higher than 30 mg are needed (i.e. bodyweight > 45 kg), two injections have to be 
administered. 
Starting dose for patients switching from daily growth hormone medicinal products 
For patients switching from daily growth hormone medicinal products, the weekly therapy with 
somatrogon may be initiated at a dose of 0.66 mg/kg/week on the day following their last daily 
injection. 
Dose titration 
Somatrogon dose may be adjusted as necessary, based on growth velocity, adverse reactions, body 
weight and serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations. 
When monitoring for IGF-1, samples should always be drawn 4 days after the prior dose. Dose 
adjustments should be targeted to achieve average IGF-1 standard deviation score (SDS) levels in the 
normal range, i.e. between -2 and +2 (preferably close to 0 SDS). 
In patients whose serum IGF-1 concentrations exceed the mean reference value for their age and sex 
by more than 2 SDS, the dose of somatrogon should be reduced by 15%. More than one dose 
reduction may be required in some patients.  
Treatment evaluation and discontinuation 
Evaluation of efficacy and safety should be considered at approximately 6 to 12 month intervals and 
may be assessed by evaluating auxological parameters, biochemistry (IGF-1, hormones, glucose 
levels) and pubertal status. Routine monitoring of serum IGF-1 SDS levels throughout the course of 
treatment is recommended. More frequent evaluations should be considered during puberty. 
Treatment should be discontinued when there is evidence of closure of the epiphyseal growth plates 
(see section 4.3). Treatment should also be discontinued in patients having achieved final height or 
near final height, i.e. an annualised height velocity < 2 cm/year or a bone age > 14 years in girls or 
> 16 years in boys. 
Missed dose 
Patients should maintain their regular dosing day. If a dose is missed, somatrogon should be 
administered as soon as possible within 3 days after the missed dose, and then the usual once weekly 
dosing schedule should be resumed. If more than 3 days have passed, the missed dose should be 
skipped and the next dose should be administered on the regularly scheduled day. In each case, 
patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. 
Changing the dosing day 
The day of weekly administration can be changed if necessary as long as the time between two doses 
is at least 3 days. After selecting a new dosing day, the once weekly dosing should be continued. 
Special populations 
Elderly  
The safety and efficacy of somatrogon in patients over the age of 65 years have not been established. 
No data are available. 
Renal impairment 
Somatrogon has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. No dose recommendation can be 
made.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Somatrogon has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose recommendation can 
be made.  
Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of somatrogon in neonates, infants and children less than 3 years of age have 
not yet been established. No data are available.  
Method of administration  
Somatrogon is administered by subcutaneous injection. 
Somatrogon is to be injected in the abdomen, thighs, buttocks or upper arms. The site of injection 
should be rotated at each administration. Injections to the upper arms and buttocks should be given by 
the caregiver. 
The patient and caregiver should receive training to ensure understanding of the administration 
procedure to support self-administration. 
If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, each injection should be 
administered at a different injection site. 
Somatrogon is to be administered once weekly, on the same day each week, at any time of the day. 
Ngenla 24 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The pre-filled pen delivers doses from 0.2 mg to 12 mg of somatrogon in increments of 0.2 mg 
(0.01 mL). 
Ngenla 60 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The pre-filled pen delivers doses from 0.5 mg to 30 mg of somatrogon in increments of 0.5 mg 
(0.01 mL). 
For instructions on the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and at the end of the 
package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to somatrogon (see section 4.4) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Somatrogon must not be used when there is any evidence of activity of a tumour based on experience 
with daily growth hormone medicinal products. Intracranial tumours must be inactive and antitumour 
therapy must be completed prior to starting growth hormone (GH) therapy. Treatment should be 
discontinued if there is evidence of tumour growth (see section 4.4). 
Somatrogon must not be used for growth promotion in children with closed epiphyses. 
Patients with acute critical illness suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal 
surgery, multiple accidental trauma, acute respiratory failure or similar conditions must not be treated 
with somatrogon (regarding patients undergoing substitution therapy, see section 4.4).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability  
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hypersensitivity 
Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported with 
daily growth hormone medicinal products. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, use of 
somatrogon should be immediately discontinued; patients should be treated promptly per standard of 
care and monitored until signs and symptoms resolve (see section 4.3). 
Hypoadrenalism 
Based on published data patients receiving daily growth hormone therapy who have or are at risk for 
pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of 
central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for 
previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses 
following initiation of somatrogon treatment (see section 4.5). Patients should be monitored for 
reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increases in those with known 
hypoadrenalism (see section 4.5).  
Thyroid function impairment 
Growth hormone increases the extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 and may unmask incipient 
hypothyroidism. Patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism should be treated accordingly prior to the 
initiation of treatment with somatrogon as indicated based on clinical evaluation. As hypothyroidism 
interferes with the response to growth hormone therapy, patients should have their thyroid function 
tested regularly and should receive replacement therapy with thyroid hormone when indicated (see 
sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
Prader-Willi syndrome  
Somatrogon has not been studied in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome. Somatrogon is not indicated 
for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically 
confirmed Prader-Willi syndrome unless they also have a diagnosis of GHD. There have been reports 
of sudden death after initiating therapy with growth hormone in paediatric patients with Prader-Willi 
syndrome who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway 
obstruction or sleep apnoea, or unidentified respiratory infection. 
Glucose metabolism impairment 
Treatment with growth hormone medicinal products may reduce insulin sensitivity and induce 
hyperglycaemia. Additional monitoring should be considered in patients treated with somatrogon who 
have glucose intolerance, or additional risk factors for diabetes. In patients treated with somatrogon 
who have diabetes mellitus, hypoglycaemic medicinal products might require adjustment (see section 
4.5).  
Neoplasm 
In patients with previous malignant disease, special attention should be given to signs and symptoms 
of relapse. Patients with pre-existing tumours or growth hormone deficiency secondary to an 
intracranial lesion should be examined routinely for progression or recurrence of the underlying 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disease process. In childhood cancer survivors, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been 
reported in patients treated with somatropin after their first neoplasm. Intracranial tumours, in 
particular meningiomas, in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm, were the 
most common of these second neoplasms. 
Benign intracranial hypertension 
Intracranial hypertension (IH) with papilledema, ataxia, visual changes, headache, nausea and/or 
vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with growth hormone medicinal 
products. Funduscopic examination is recommended at the initiation of treatment and as clinically 
warranted. In patients with clinical or funduscopic evidence of IH, somatrogon should be temporarily 
discontinued. At present there is insufficient evidence to give specific advice on the continuation of 
growth hormone treatment in patients with resolved IH. If treatment with somatrogon is restarted, 
monitoring for signs and symptoms of IH is necessary.  
Acute critical illness 
In critically ill adult patients suffering complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, 
multiple accidental trauma or acute respiratory failure mortality was higher in patients treated with 
5.3 mg or 8 mg somatropin daily (i.e. 37.1 – 56 mg/week) compared to patients receiving placebo, 
42% vs. 19%. Based on this information, these types of patients should not be treated with 
somatrogon. As there is no information available on the safety of growth hormone substitution therapy 
in acutely critically ill patients, the benefits of continued somatrogon treatment in this situation should 
be weighed against the potential risks involved. In all patients developing other or similar acute critical 
illness, the possible benefit of treatment with somatrogon must be weighed against the potential risk 
involved. 
Pancreatitis 
Although rare in patients treated with growth hormone medicinal products, pancreatitis should be 
considered in somatrogon-treated patients who develop severe abdominal pain during treatment. 
Scoliosis 
Because somatrogon increases growth rate, signs of development or progression of scoliosis should be 
monitored during treatment. 
Epiphyseal disorders  
Epiphyseal disorders, including slipped capital femoral epiphysis may occur more frequently in 
patients with endocrine disorders or in patients undergoing rapid growth. Any paediatric patient with 
the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during treatment should be carefully evaluated. 
Oral oestrogen therapy  
Oral oestrogen influences the IGF-1 response to growth hormone. If a female patient taking 
somatrogon begins or discontinues oral oestrogen containing therapy, IGF-1 value should be 
monitored to determine if the dose of growth hormone should be adjusted to maintain the serum IGF-1 
levels within the normal range (see section 4.2). In female patients on oral oestrogen-containing 
therapy, a higher dose of somatrogon may be required to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.5).

Excipients  
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free.’ 
Metacresol 
Myositis is a very rare adverse event that may be related to the preservative metacresol. In the case of 
myalgia or disproportionate pain at injection site, myositis should be considered and if confirmed, 
other growth hormone medicinal products without metacresol should be used. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions studies in paediatrics have been performed.  
Glucocorticoids 
Concomitant treatment with glucocorticoids may inhibit the growth-promoting effects of somatrogon. 
Patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency should have their glucocorticoid 
replacement therapy carefully adjusted to avoid any inhibitory effect on growth. Therefore, patients 
treated with glucocorticoids should have their growth monitored carefully to assess the potential 
impact of glucocorticoid treatment on growth. 
Growth hormone decreases the conversion of cortisone to cortisol and may unmask previously 
undiscovered central hypoadrenalism or render low glucocorticoid replacement doses ineffective (see 
section 4.4). 
Insulin and hypoglycaemic medicinal products 
In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring medicinal product therapy, the dose of insulin and/or 
oral/injectable hypoglycaemic medicinal products may require adjustment when somatrogon therapy is 
initiated (see section 4.4). 
Thyroid medicinal products  
Treatment with daily growth hormone may unmask previously undiagnosed or subclinical central 
hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement therapy may need to be initiated or adjusted (see section 4.4).  
Oral oestrogen therapy 
In female patients on oral oestrogen-containing therapy, a higher dose of somatrogon may be required 
to achieve the treatment goal (see section 4.4). 
Cytochrome P450 metabolised products 
Drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with somatrogon. Somatrogon has been shown 
to induce CYP3A4 mRNA expression in vitro. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Studies 
with other human growth hormone (hGH) receptor agonists performed in growth hormone deficient 
children and adults, and healthy elderly men, suggest that administration may increase the clearance of 
compounds known to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, especially CYP3A. The 
clearance of compounds metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. sex steroids, corticosteroids, anticonvulsants 
and ciclosporin) may be increased and could result in lower exposure of these compounds.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of somatrogon in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Ngenla is not 
recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether somatrogon/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from somatrogon therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for 
the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The risk of infertility in females or males of reproductive potential has not been studied in humans. In 
a rat study, the fertility in males and females was not affected (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ngenla has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The commonly reported adverse reactions after treatment with somatrogon are injection site reactions 
(ISRs) (25.1%), headache (10.7% ) and pyrexia (10.2%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Safety data are derived from the phase 2, multi-centre safety and dose-finding study, and the pivotal 
phase 3, multi-centre non-inferiority study in paediatric patients with GHD (see section 5.1). The data 
reflect exposure of 265 patients to somatrogon administered once weekly (0.66 mg/kg/week). 
Table 1 presents the adverse reactions for somatrogon within the system organ class (SOC). The 
adverse reactions listed in the table below are presented by SOC and frequency categories, defined 
using the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) or frequency not known 
(cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are 
presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reaction 
In the phase 3 clinical study, reporting of ISRs was actively solicited during the course of the study. In 
the majority of cases, local ISRs tended to be transient, occurred mainly in the first 6 months of 
treatment and were mild in severity; ISRs had a mean onset on the day of the injection and a mean 
duration of < 1 day. Among them, injection site pain, erythema, pruritus, swelling, induration, 
bruising, hypertrophy, inflammation and warmth were reported in 43.1% of patients treated with 
somatrogon compared to 25.2% of patients administered daily injections of somatropin.  
In the long-term OLE of the clinical phase 3 study, local ISRs were similar in nature and severity, and 
reported early in subjects switching from somatropin to somatrogon treatment. ISRs were reported in 
18.3% of patients originally treated with somatrogon in the main study and continuing treatment in the 
OLE portion of the study, and likewise, 37% were reported among patients originally treated with 
somatropin that were switched in the OLE portion of the study to treatment with somatrogon. 
Immunogenicity 
In the pivotal safety and efficacy study, among 109 subjects treated with somatrogon, 84 (77.1%) 
tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). There were no clinical or safety effects observed with 
the formation of antibodies. 
Other adverse drug reactions for somatropin may be considered class effects, such as: 
•

Neoplasms benign and malignant: (see section 4.4). 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: diabetes mellitus type 2 (see section 4.4). 
Nervous system disorders: benign intracranial hypertension (see section 4.4), paraesthesia. 
Musculoskeletal, connective tissue, and bone disorders: myalgia. 
Reproductive system and breast disorders: gynaecomastia. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: skin rash, urticaria and pruritus. 
General disorders and administration site conditions: peripheral oedema, facial oedema. 
Gastrointestinal disorders: pancreatitis (see section 4.4). 
Metacresol 
This medicinal product contains metacresol which may contribute to painful injections (see section 
4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Single doses of somatrogon higher than 0.66 mg/kg/week have not been studied. 
Based on experience with daily growth hormone medicinal products, short-term overdose could lead 
initially to hypoglycaemia and subsequently to hyperglycaemia. Long-term overdose could result in 
signs and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly consistent with the effects of growth hormone 
excess.  
Treatment of overdose with somatrogon should consist of general supportive measures.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Pituitary and hypothalamic hormones and analogues, somatropin and 
somatropin agonists, ATC code: H01AC08. 
Mechanism of action 
Somatrogon is a glycoprotein comprised of the amino acid sequence of hGH with one copy of the of 
C-terminal peptide (CTP) from the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the N-
terminus and two copies of CTP (in tandem) at the C-terminus. The glycosylation and CTP domains 
account for the half-life of somatrogon, which allows for weekly dosing. 
Somatrogon binds to the GH receptor and initiates a signal transduction cascade culminating in 
changes in growth and metabolism. Consistent with GH signalling, somatrogon binding leads to 
activation of the STAT5b signalling pathway and increases the serum concentration of IGF-1. IGF-1 
was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner during treatment with somatrogon partially 
mediating the clinical effect. As a result, GH and IGF-1 stimulate metabolic changes, linear growth 
and enhance growth velocity in paediatric patients with GHD.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical studies, somatrogon increases IGF-1. Pharmacodynamic evaluations performed 
approximately 96 hours after dose administration in order to assess the mean IGF-1 standard deviation 
score (SDS) over the dosing interval showed IGF-1 values normalised in treated subjects at one month 
of treatment. 
Water and mineral metabolism 
Somatrogon induces the retention of phosphorus. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The safety and efficacy of somatrogon for the treatment of children and adolescents from 3 years of 
age with GHD were evaluated in two multi-centre randomised, open-label controlled clinical studies. 
Both studies included a 12-month main study period that compared once weekly somatrogon to 
somatropin administered once daily followed by a single arm OLE period during which all patients 
were administered somatrogon once weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was 
annualised height velocity (HV) following 12 months of treatment. Other endpoints reflective of 
catch-up growth such as change in height SDS from baseline and height SDS were also evaluated in 
both studies. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pivotal phase 3 multi-centre non-inferiority study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
0.66 mg/kg/week dose of somatrogon compared to 0.034 mg/kg/day of somatropin in 224 pre-pubertal 
paediatric patients with GHD. The mean age across the treatment groups was 7.7 years (min 3.01, 
max 11.96), 40.2% of patients were > 3 years to ≤ 7 years, 59.8% were > 7 years. 71.9% of patients 
were male and 28.1% were female. In this study, 74.6% of patients were White, 20.1% were Asian; 
0.9% were Black. Baseline disease characteristics were balanced across both treatment groups. 
Approximately 68% of patients had peak plasma GH levels of ≤ 7 ng/mL, and the mean height was 
below -2 SDS. 
Once weekly somatrogon was non-inferior based on HV at 12 months compared to somatropin 
administered once daily (see Table 2). Once weekly somatrogon also produced an increase in IGF-1 
SDS values, from a mean of -1.95 at baseline to a mean of 0.65 at 12 months.

In the open-label extension of the pivotal phase 3 study, 91 patients received 0.66 mg/kg/week of 
somatrogon for at least 2 years and provided height data. A progressive gain in height SDS from 
baseline was observed at 2 years [cumulative change in height SDS mean (SD) = 1.38 (0.78), 
median = 1.19 (range: 0.2, 4.9)]. 
In the phase 2, multi-centre safety and dose-finding study, 31 patients received up to 0.66 mg/kg/week 
of somatrogon for up to 7.7 years. At the last assessment, height SDS [mean (SD)] was -0.39 (0.95) 
and cumulative change in HT SDS [mean (SD)] from baseline was 3.37 (1.27). 
Treatment burden  
In a phase 3 randomised, open-label, crossover study in 87 paediatric patients with GHD, the impact 
of somatrogon administered once weekly (0.66 mg/kg/week) on treatment burden was compared to 
daily somatropin. Somatrogon administered once weekly demonstrated significant improvement 
(reduction) in treatment burden for the patient, improved (reduced) treatment burden for the caregiver, 
greater patient convenience, greater intent to comply and greater patient preference.  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Ngenla in all subsets of the paediatric population for the long-term treatment of paediatric patients 
with growth disturbance due to insufficient secretion of growth hormone (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Somatrogon pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for somatrogon in 
42 paediatric patients (age range 3-15.5 years) with GHD. 
Absorption 
Following subcutaneous injection, serum concentrations increased slowly, peaking 6 to 18 hours after 
dosing.  
In paediatric patients with GHD, somatrogon exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner for 
doses of 0.25 mg/kg/week, 0.48 mg/kg/week and 0.66 mg/kg/week. There is no accumulation of 
somatrogon after once weekly administration. In paediatric patients with GHD, the population PK 
estimated steady-state peak concentrations following 0.66 mg/kg/week was 636 ng/mL. Patients who 
tested positive for ADA had an approximately 45% higher steady-state average concentration. 
Distribution 
In paediatric patients with GHD, the population PK estimated apparent central volume of distribution 
was 0.728 L/kg and apparent peripheral volume of distribution was 0.165 L/kg.  
Biotransformation 
The metabolic fate of somatrogon is believed to be classical protein catabolism, with subsequent 
reclamation of the amino acids and return to the systemic circulation. 
Elimination 
In paediatric patients with GHD, the population PK estimated apparent clearance was 0.0317 L/h/kg. 
Patients who tested positive for ADA had an approximately 25.8% decrease in apparent clearance. 
With a population PK estimated effective half-life of 28.2 hours, somatrogon will be present in the 
circulation for about 6 days after the last dose. 
Special populations 
Age, race, gender, body weight 
Based on population PK analyses, age, sex, race and ethnicity do not have a clinically meaningful 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of somatrogon in paediatric patients with GHD. The exposure of 
somatrogon decreases with an increase in body weight. However, the somatrogon dose of 
0.66 mg/kg/week provides adequate systemic exposure to safely achieve efficacy over the weight 
range evaluated in the clinical studies. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology and repeat-dose toxicity. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in rats with somatrogon 
administered subcutaneously at doses up to 30 mg/kg (associated with exposures levels approximately 
14 times the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC).  
Somatrogon induced an increase in oestrous cycle length, copulatory interval, and number of corpora 
lutea in female rats but no effects on mating indices, fertility or early embryonic development. 
No effects of somatrogon were observed on embryo-foetal development.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a pre-postnatal development study somatrogon elicited an increase in first generation (F1) mean 
body weights (both sexes) as well as an increase in the mean copulatory interval in F1 females at the 
highest dose (30 mg/kg), which was consistent with a longer oestrous cycle length; however, there 
were no associated effects on mating indices.

permanently sealed in a plastic pen, contains 1.2 mL of somatrogon. The cartridge is closed at the 
bottom with a rubber stopper (Type I rubber closures) shaped as a plunger and at the top with a rubber 
stopper (Type I rubber closures) shaped as a disc and sealed with an aluminium cap. The pen cap, dose 
button and label on the pen are coloured blue.  
Pack size of 1 pre-filled pen. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
The solution should appear clear and colourless to slightly light yellow solution and be free of 
particles. Do not inject the medicinal product if it is cloudy, dark yellow, or contains particulate 
matter. Do not shake, shaking can damage the medicinal product. 
Each Ngenla pre-filled pen is for use by a single patient. A Ngenla pre-filled pen must never be shared 
between patients, even if the needle is changed. 
The pre-filled pen should only be used up to 28 days after first use and before the expiry date.  
Do not freeze the medicinal product. Do not expose to heat (above 32 °C). Do not use Ngenla if it has 
been frozen or exposed to heat, discard. 
Dose preparation  
The pen may be used straight from the refrigerator. For a more comfortable injection, the pre-filled 
pen containing the sterile solution of somatrogon may be allowed to reach room temperature up to 
32 °C for up to 30 minutes. The solution in the pen should be inspected for flakes, particles and 
colouration. The pen should not be shaken. If flakes, particles or discolouration are observed, the pen 
should not be used. 
Administration  
The designated injection site should be prepared as instructed in the Instructions for Use. It is 
recommended to rotate the injection site at each administration. When in use, always replace the pen 
cap on the pre-filled pen after each injection. Return Ngenla to the refrigerator again after each use. A 
new needle must always be attached before use. Needles must not be re-used. The injection needle 
should be removed after each injection and the pen should be stored without a needle attached. This 
may prevent blocked needles, contamination, infection, leakage of solution and inaccurate dosing. 
In the event of blocked needles (i.e. liquid does not appear at the needle tip), patients must follow the 
instructions described in the Instructions for Use accompanying the package leaflet.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sterile needles are required for administration but are not included. Ngenla can be administered with a 
needle from 4 mm to 8 mm and 31 or 32G. 
Instructions for the preparation and administration of the product are given in the package leaflet and 
Instructions For Use.  
Disposal  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. If the pre-filled pen is empty, has been exposed to temperatures higher than 32 °C, has 
been removed from the refrigerator for more than 4 hours with each use, has been used 5 times, or it 
has been more than 28 days after first use, it should be disposed of even if it contains unused 
medicinal product. A small amount of the sterile somatrogon solution may remain in the pen after all 
doses have been correctly given. Patients should be instructed not to use the remaining solution, but to 
properly discard the pen.

6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ngenla is and what it is used for 
Ngenla contains the active substance somatrogon, a modified form of human growth hormone. Natural 
human growth hormone is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your fat and muscle 
tissues to develop in the right amounts. Ngenla is used to treat children and adolescents from 3 years 
of age who do not have enough growth hormone and are not growing at the normal rate. 
The active substance in Ngenla is made by 'recombinant DNA technology'. This means that it is grown 
in cells that have been modified in the laboratory so that they can produce it. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ngenla  
Do not use Ngenla  
- 
- 
- 
- 
If you or the child in your care are allergic to somatrogon (see Warnings and precautions) or any 
of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you or the child in your care have an active tumour (cancer). Tell your doctor if you or the 
child in your care have or have had an active tumour. Tumours must be inactive, and you or the 
child in your care must have finished your anti-tumour treatment before starting treatment with 
Ngenla. 
If you or the child in your care have stopped growing because of closure of the growth plates 
(closed epiphyses) meaning that you or the child in your care have been told by your doctor that 
your bones have stopped growing. 
If you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open 
heart surgery, abdominal surgery, acute respiratory failure, multiple accidental trauma or similar 
conditions). If you or the child in your care are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that 
you use growth hormone. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ngenla:  
- 
If you or the child in your care develop a serious allergic reaction, stop using Ngenla, talk to 
your doctor right away. Sometimes serious allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity, including 
anaphylaxis or angioedema (difficulties breathing or swallowing, or swelling of the face, lips, 
throat or tongue) have occurred. If you or the child in your care have any of the following 
symptoms of a serious allergic reaction:  
breathing problems 
swelling of your face, mouth, and tongue 
hives (nettle rash, lumps rising under the skin) 
rash 
fever

If you or the child in your care have replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids) you or the child in your care should consult your doctor regularly as you or the 
child in your care may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. 
Your doctor should check at intervals how well the thyroid gland is working in you or the child 
in your care and if necessary may prescribe treatment or adjust the dose of existing treatment as 
this may be needed for Ngenla to work properly.  
If you or the child in your care have Prader-Willi syndrome, you or the child should not be 
treated with Ngenla unless you or the child in your care has growth hormone deficiency. 
Your doctor should monitor you or the child in your care for high blood sugar levels 
(hyperglycaemia) during treatment with Ngenla. If you or the child in your care are treated with 
insulin or other diabetes medicines, your doctor may need to adjust the insulin dose. If you or 
the child in your care have diabetes and associated severe/worsening eye disease you or the 
child in your care should not be treated with Ngenla. 
If you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour (cancer). 
If you or the child in your care experience changes in vision, severe or frequent headaches, 
associated with feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, or experience lack of muscle control or 
coordination of voluntary movements, such as walking or picking up objects, difficulty with 
speech, eye movement or swallowing, especially at the start of treatment, tell your doctor 
immediately. These could be signs of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain 
(intracranial hypertension).  
If you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open 
heart surgery, abdominal surgery, acute respiratory failure, multiple accidental trauma or similar 
conditions). If you or the child in your care are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or 
go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that 
you or the child in your care use growth hormone. 
If you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Ngenla as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas. 
If you or the child in your care notice a sideways curvature in your spine (scoliosis), you or the 
child in your care will need to be checked often by your doctor.  
If during growing you or the child in your care develop a limp or hip or knee pain, you or the 
child in your care should consult your doctor right away. These could be symptoms of bone 
disorders in your hip as this may happen during periods of rapid growth. 
If you or the child in your care are taking or stop taking oral contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy with oestrogen, your doctor may recommend the dose of Ngenla to be 
adjusted. 
Other medicines and Ngenla 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or 
might use any other medicines.  
- 
If you or the child in your care take replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids), as these may reduce the effect of Ngenla on growth. You or the child in your 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
care should consult your doctor regularly, as you or the child in your care may need adjustment 
of your glucocorticoid dose. 
If you or the child in your care are treated with insulin or other diabetes medicines, you should 
consult with your doctor as you or your doctor may need to adjust the dose. 
If you or the child in your care are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones, your doctor may 
need to adjust the dose. 
If you or the child in your care are receiving oestrogen taken orally, you should consult your 
doctor as you or the child may need to adjust your dose of Ngenla. 
If you or the child in your care are receiving ciclosporin (a medicine that weakens the immune 
system after transplantation), you should consult your doctor as your doctor may need to adjust 
the dose. 
If you or the child in your care are receiving medicines to control epilepsy (anticonvulsants), 
you should consult your doctor as your doctor may need to adjust the dose.

- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you or the child in your care are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you or the child in your care may 
be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. 
Ngenla has not been tested in pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your 
unborn baby. It is therefore preferable to avoid Ngenla during pregnancy. If you are able to get 
pregnant, you should not use Ngenla unless you are also using reliable contraception. 
It is not known whether somatrogon can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor or the doctor of the 
child in your care, if you or the child in your care are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will 
then help you or the child in your care decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking 
Ngenla, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Ngenla to you or the 
child in your care. 
Driving and using machines 
Ngenla does not affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Ngenla contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Ngenla contains metacresol 
Ngenla contains a preservative called metacresol. In very rare cases the presence of metacresol can 
cause inflammation (swelling) in muscles. If you or the child in your care experience muscle pain or 
pain at the injection site, inform your doctor.  
3. 
How to use Ngenla 
This medicine will only be prescribed by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment 
and who has confirmed your diagnosis or that of the child in your care. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure.  
The dose of Ngenla to be injected will be decided by your doctor.  
How much to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose of Ngenla from your body weight in kilograms. The 
recommended dose is 0.66 mg per kg body weight and is given once weekly. If you or the child in 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your care have been previously treated with daily growth hormone injections, your doctor will tell you 
to wait before taking the first dose of Ngenla until the day after your last daily injection and then 
continue with Ngenla once each week. 
Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to.

Ngenla is available as a pre-filled pen in 2 different sizes (Ngenla 24 mg and Ngenla 60 mg). 
Based on the recommended dose your doctor or the doctor of the child in your care will 
prescribe the most appropriate pen size (see section 6 “Contents of the pack and other 
information”). 
Before you or the child in your care use the pen for the first time, your/their doctor or nurse will 
show you how to use it. Ngenla is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) 
using a pre-filled pen. Do not inject it into a vein or muscle.  
The best place to give Ngenla is in the abdomen (belly), thighs, buttocks or upper arms. 
Injections to the upper arms and buttocks should be given by the caregiver. 
Change the site of injection on your body, or on the body of the child in your care, each time a 
dose is administered.  
If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, each should be administered at 
a different injection site.

When to use Ngenla 
You or the child in your care should use this medicine once a week on the same day each week.

it has been at least 3 days since you or the child in your care had your/their last injection. After 
selecting a new dosing day, continue giving yourself or the child in your care the injection on that day 
each week. 
If you use more Ngenla than you should 
If you or the child in your care have injected more Ngenla than you should have been given, contact 
your doctor straight away as your/their blood sugar levels may need to be checked.  
If you forget to use Ngenla 
If you or the child in your care forgot to inject a dose and: 
- 
- 
It is 3 days or less since you or the child in your care should have used Ngenla, use it as soon as 
you remember. Then inject your/their next dose on your/their usual injection day. 
It is more than 3 days since you or the child in your care should have used Ngenla, skip the 
missed dose. Then inject your/their next dose as usual on your/their next scheduled day. A

Instructions for use 
Ngenla 24 mg Pen 
Injection for subcutaneous (under the skin) use only 
Keep this leaflet. These instructions show step-by-step 
directions on how to prepare and give a Ngenla injection. 
Important information about your Ngenla pen 
  Ngenla for injection is a multi-dose pre-filled pen containing 24 mg of medicine.  
  Ngenla for injection can be given by a patient, caregiver, doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Do not 
try to inject Ngenla yourself until you are shown the right way to give the injections and read 
and understand the Instructions for Use. If your doctor, nurse or pharmacist decides that you 
or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Ngenla at home, you should receive 
training on the right way to prepare and inject Ngenla. It is important that you read, 
understand, and follow these instructions so that you inject Ngenla the right way. It is 
important to talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to be sure you understand your Ngenla 
dosing instructions. 
  To help you remember when to inject Ngenla, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Call 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you or your caregiver have any questions about the right 
way to inject Ngenla.  
  Each turn (click) of the dose knob increases the dose by 0.2 mg of medicine. You can give 
from 0.2 mg to 12 mg in a single injection. If your dose is more than 12 mg, you will need to 
give more than 1 injection. 
  A small amount of the medicine may remain in the pen after all doses have been correctly 
given. This is normal. Patients should not try to use the remaining solution but get rid of the 
pen in the correct way. 
  Do not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give 
other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. 
  Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This will reduce the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of medicine, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose. 
  Do not shake your pen. Shaking can damage the medicine. 
  The pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the assistance 
of a person trained in the proper use of the product.

scars or skin conditions. 
  Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab. 
  Allow the injection site to dry.

39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3 Check medicine

(‘Yes: Go to new pen set up’ has an arrow directing to ‘New pen set up (priming)’ and ‘No’ 
has an arrow directing to ‘Setting your prescribed dose’) 
New pen set up (priming) – for the first use of a new pen only 
You must set up each new pen (priming) before using it for the first time 
  New pen set up is done before each new pen is used for the first time. 
  The purpose of setting up a new pen is to remove air bubbles and make sure you get the 
correct dose. 
Important: Skip Step-A through to Step-C if you have already set up your pen. 
Step-A: Set knob to 0.4 
  Turn the dose knob to 0.4. 
Note: If you turn the dose knob too far, you can turn it back. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step-B: Tap cartridge holder 
  Hold the pen with the needle pointing up so that the air bubbles can rise. 
  Tap the cartridge holder gently to float any air bubbles to the top. 
Important: Follow Step-B even if you do not see air bubbles. 
Step-C: Press button and check for liquid 
  Press the injection button until it cannot go any further and “0” is shown in the dose 
window. 
  Check for liquid at the needle tip. If liquid appears, your pen is set up. 
  Always make sure that a drop of liquid appears before you inject. If liquid has not 
appeared, repeat Step-A through to Step-C. 
o 
If liquid does not appear after you have repeated Step-A through Step-C 
five (5) times, attach a new needle and try one (1) more time. 
Do not use the pen if a drop of liquid still does not appear. Contact your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist, and use a new pen. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Setting your prescribed dose 
Step 7 Set your dose 
  Turn the dose knob to set your dose. 
o  The dose can be increased or decreased by turning the dose knob in either direction. 
o  The dose knob turns 0.2 mg at a time. 
o  Your pen contains 24 mg of medicine but you can only set a dose of up to 12 mg for a 
single injection. 
o  The dose window shows the dose in mg. See Examples A and B. 
  Always check the dose window to make sure you have set the correct dose. 
Important: Do not press the injection button while setting your dose. 
What should I do if I cannot set the dose I need? 
If your dose is more than 12 mg you will need more than 1 injection. 
 
  You can give from 0.2 mg to 12 mg in a single injection. 
o 
If you need help dividing up your dose the right way, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist. 
o  Use a new needle for each injection (See Step 4: Attach needle). 
o 
If you normally need to give 2 injections for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second dose. 
What should I do if I do not have enough medicine left in my pen? 
 
 
If your pen contains less than 12 mg of medicine, the dose knob will stop with the remaining 
amount of medicine shown in the dose window. 
If there is not enough medicine left in your pen for your full dose, you may either: 
o 
inject the amount left in your pen, then prepare a new pen to complete your dose in 
full. 
Remember to subtract the dose you have already received. For example, if the dose is 
3.8 mg and you can only set the dose knob to 1.8 mg, you should inject another 
2.0 mg with a new pen. 
o  or get a new pen and inject the full dose. 
44

  Press the injection button until it cannot go any further and “0” is shown in the dose 
window. 
45

full dose of medicine to be given. 
  After counting to 10, let go of the injection button and slowly remove the pen from the 
injection site by pulling the needle straight out.

dose you just received. 
Step 11 Attach outer needle cover 
  Carefully place the outer needle cover back on the needle. 
  Press on the outer needle cover until it is secure. 
Caution: Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may prick yourself 
with the needle. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 12 Remove the needle 
  Unscrew the capped needle from the pen. 
  Gently pull until the capped needle comes off. 
Note: If the needle is still on, replace the outer needle cover and try again. Be sure to apply 
pressure when unscrewing the needle. 
Dispose of your used pen needles in a sharps container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist and in accordance with local health and safety laws. Keep the sharps container out 
of the reach of children. Do not reuse needles. 
Step 13 Replace the pen cap 
  Replace the pen cap back onto your pen.

1.  What Ngenla is and what it is used for 
Ngenla contains the active substance somatrogon, a modified form of human growth hormone. Natural 
human growth hormone is needed for bones and muscles to grow. It also helps your fat and muscle 
tissues to develop in the right amounts. Ngenla is used to treat children and adolescents from 3 years 
of age who do not have enough growth hormone and are not growing at the normal rate.

in cells that have been modified in the laboratory so that they can produce it.

If you or the child in your care have replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids) you or the child in your care should consult your doctor regularly as you or the 
child in your care may need adjustment of your glucocorticoid dose. 
Your doctor should check at intervals how well the thyroid gland is working in you or the child 
in your care and if necessary may prescribe treatment or adjust the dose of existing treatment as 
this may be needed for Ngenla to work properly.  
If you or the child in your care have Prader-Willi syndrome, you or the child should not be 
treated with Ngenla unless you or the child in your care has growth hormone deficiency. 
Your doctor should monitor you or the child in your care for high blood sugar levels 
(hyperglycaemia) during treatment with Ngenla. If you or the child in your care are treated with 
insulin or other diabetes medicines, your doctor may need to adjust the insulin dose. If you or 
the child in your care have diabetes and associated severe/worsening eye disease you or the 
child in your care should not be treated with Ngenla. 
If you or the child in your care have ever had any kind of tumour (cancer).

associated with feeling sick (nausea), vomiting, or experience lack of muscle control or 
coordination of voluntary movements, such as walking or picking up objects, difficulty with 
speech, eye movement or swallowing, especially at the start of treatment, tell your doctor 
immediately. These could be signs of a temporary increase in pressure within the brain 
(intracranial hypertension).  
If you or the child in your care are seriously ill (for example, complications following open 
heart surgery, abdominal surgery, acute respiratory failure, multiple accidental trauma or similar 
conditions). If you or the child in your care are about to have, or have had, a major operation, or 
go into hospital for any reason, tell your doctor and remind the other doctors you are seeing that 
you or the child in your care use growth hormone. 
If you or the child in your care develop a severe stomach ache during treatment with Ngenla as 
this could be a symptom of inflammation of the pancreas. 
If you or the child in your care notice a sideways curvature in your spine (scoliosis), you or the 
child in your care will need to be checked often by your doctor.  
If during growing you or the child in your care develop a limp or hip or knee pain, you or the 
child in your care should consult your doctor right away. These could be symptoms of bone 
disorders in your hip as this may happen during periods of rapid growth. 
If you or the child in your care are taking or stop taking oral contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy with oestrogen, your doctor may recommend the dose of Ngenla to be 
adjusted. 
Other medicines and Ngenla 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you or the child in your care are using, have recently used or 
might use any other medicines.  
- 
If you or the child in your care take replacement therapy with corticosteroid medicines 
(glucocorticoids), as these may reduce the effect of Ngenla on growth. You or the child in your 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
care should consult your doctor regularly, as you or the child in your care may need adjustment 
of your glucocorticoid dose.

consult with your doctor as you or your doctor may need to adjust the dose. 
If you or the child in your care are receiving treatment with thyroid hormones, your doctor may

- 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
If you or the child in your care are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you or the child in your care may 
be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this 
medicine. 
Ngenla has not been tested in pregnant women and it is not known if this medicine can harm your 
unborn baby. It is therefore preferable to avoid Ngenla during pregnancy. If you are able to get 
pregnant, you should not use Ngenla unless you are also using reliable contraception. 
It is not known whether somatrogon can pass into breast milk. Tell your doctor or the doctor of the 
child in your care, if you or the child in your care are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will 
then help you or the child in your care decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking 
Ngenla, considering the benefit of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Ngenla to you or the 
child in your care. 
Driving and using machines 
Ngenla does not affect the ability to drive and use machines. 
Ngenla contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Ngenla contains metacresol 
Ngenla contains a preservative called metacresol. In very rare cases the presence of metacresol can 
cause inflammation (swelling) in muscles. If you or the child in your care experience muscle pain or 
pain at the injection site, inform your doctor.  
3. 
How to use Ngenla 
This medicine will only be prescribed by a doctor who has experience with growth hormone treatment 
and who has confirmed your diagnosis or that of the child in your care. 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse if you are not sure.  
The dose of Ngenla to be injected will be decided by your doctor.  
How much to use 
Your doctor will work out your dose of Ngenla from your body weight in kilograms. The 
recommended dose is 0.66 mg per kg body weight and is given once weekly. If you or the child in 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
your care have been previously treated with daily growth hormone injections, your doctor will tell you 
to wait before taking the first dose of Ngenla until the day after your last daily injection and then 
continue with Ngenla once each week. 
Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. 
How Ngenla is given 
- 
Ngenla is available as a pre-filled pen in 2 different sizes (Ngenla 24 mg and Ngenla 60 mg). 
Based on the recommended dose your doctor or the doctor of the child in your care will 
prescribe the most appropriate pen size (see section 6 “Contents of the pack and other 
information”). 
Before you or the child in your care use the pen for the first time, your/their doctor or nurse will 
show you how to use it. Ngenla is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) 
using a pre-filled pen. Do not inject it into a vein or muscle.  
The best place to give Ngenla is in the abdomen (belly), thighs, buttocks or upper arms. 
Injections to the upper arms and buttocks should be given by the caregiver. 
Change the site of injection on your body, or on the body of the child in your care, each time a 
dose is administered.  
If more than one injection is required to deliver a complete dose, each should be administered at 
a different injection site.

each week. 
If you use more Ngenla than you should 
If you or the child in your care have injected more Ngenla than you should have been given, contact

Instructions for use 
Ngenla 60 mg Pen 
Injection for subcutaneous (under the skin) use only 
Keep this leaflet. These instructions show step-by-step 
directions on how to prepare and give a Ngenla injection. 
Important information about your Ngenla pen 
  Ngenla for injection is a multi-dose pre-filled pen containing 60 mg of medicine.  
  Ngenla for injection can be given by a patient, caregiver, doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Do not 
try to inject Ngenla yourself until you are shown the right way to give the injections and read 
and understand the Instructions for Use. If your doctor, nurse or pharmacist decides that you 
or a caregiver may be able to give your injections of Ngenla at home, you should receive 
training on the right way to prepare and inject Ngenla. It is important that you read, 
understand, and follow these instructions so that you inject Ngenla the right way. It is 
important to talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist to be sure you understand your Ngenla 
dosing instructions. 
  To help you remember when to inject Ngenla, you can mark your calendar ahead of time. Call 
your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you or your caregiver have any questions about the right 
way to inject Ngenla. 
  Each turn (click) of the dose knob increases the dose by 0.5 mg of medicine. You can give 
from 0.5 mg to 30 mg in a single injection. If your dose is more than 30 mg, you will need to 
give more than 1 injection. 
  A small amount of the medicine may remain in the pen after all doses have been correctly 
given. This is normal. Patients should not try to use the remaining solution but get rid of the 
pen in the correct way. 
  Do not share your pen with other people, even if the needle has been changed. You may give 
other people a serious infection, or get a serious infection from them. 
  Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This will reduce the risk of contamination, 
infection, leakage of medicine, and blocked needles leading to the wrong dose. 
  Do not shake your pen. Shaking can damage the medicine. 
  The pen is not recommended for use by the blind or visually impaired without the assistance 
of a person trained in the proper use of the product.

New pen set up (priming) – for the first use of a new pen only 
You must set up each new pen (priming) before using it for the first time 
  New pen set up is done before each new pen is used for the first time. 
  The purpose of setting up a new pen is to remove air bubbles and make sure you get the 
correct dose. 
Important: Skip Step-A through to Step-C if you have already set up your pen. 
Step-A: Set knob to 1.0 
  Turn the dose knob to 1.0. 
Note: If you turn the dose knob too far, you can turn it back.

Step-B: Tap cartridge holder 
  Hold the pen with the needle pointing up so that the air bubbles can rise. 
  Tap the cartridge holder gently to float any air bubbles to the top. 
Important: Follow Step-B even if you do not see air bubbles. 
Step-C: Press button and check for liquid 
  Press the injection button until it cannot go any further and “0” is shown in the dose 
window. 
  Check for liquid at the needle tip. If liquid appears, your pen is set up. 
  Always make sure that a drop of liquid appears before you inject. If liquid has not 
appeared, repeat Step-A through to Step-C. 
o 
If liquid does not appear after you have repeated Step-A through Step-C 
five (5) times, attach a new needle and try one (1) more time. 
Do not use the pen if a drop of liquid still does not appear. Contact your doctor, 
nurse or pharmacist, and use a new pen.

Setting your prescribed dose 
Step 7 Set your dose 
  Turn the dose knob to set your dose. 
o  The dose can be increased or decreased by turning the dose knob in either direction. 
o  The dose knob turns 0.5 mg at a time. 
o  Your pen contains 60 mg of medicine but you can only set a dose of up to 30 mg for a 
single injection. 
o  The dose window shows the dose in mg. See Examples A and B. 
  Always check the dose window to make sure you have set the correct dose. 
Important: Do not press the injection button while setting your dose. 
What should I do if I cannot set the dose I need? 
If your dose is more than 30 mg you will need more than 1 injection. 
 
  You can give from 0.5 mg to 30 mg in a single injection. 
o 
If you need help dividing up your dose the right way, ask your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist. 
o  Use a new needle for each injection (See Step 4: Attach needle). 
o 
If you normally need to give 2 injections for your full dose, be sure to give your 
second dose. 
What should I do if I do not have enough medicine left in my pen? 
 
 
If your pen contains less than 30 mg of medicine, the dose knob will stop with the remaining 
amount of medicine shown in the dose window. 
If there is not enough medicine left in your pen for your full dose, you may either: 
o 
inject the amount left in your pen, then prepare a new pen to complete your dose in 
full. 
Remember to subtract the dose you have already received. For example, if the dose is 
21.5 mg and you can only set the dose knob to 17 mg, you should inject another 
4.5 mg with a new pen. 
o  or get a new pen and inject the full dose.

Injecting your dose 
Step 8 Insert the needle 
  Hold your pen so you can see the numbers in the dose window. 
 
Insert the needle straight into your skin. 
Step 9 Inject your medicine 
  Keep holding the needle in the same position in your skin. 
  Press the injection button until it cannot go any further and “0” is shown in the dose 
window.

Step 10 Count to 10 
  Continue to press the injection button while counting to 10. Counting to 10 will allow the 
full dose of medicine to be given. 
  After counting to 10, let go of the injection button and slowly remove the pen from the 
injection site by pulling the needle straight out. 
Note: You may see a drop of medicine at the needle tip. This is normal and does not affect the 
dose you just received. 
Step 11 Attach outer needle cover 
  Carefully place the outer needle cover back on the needle. 
  Press on the outer needle cover until it is secure. 
Caution: Never try to put the inner needle cap back on the needle. You may prick yourself 
with the needle.

Step 12 Remove the needle 
  Unscrew the capped needle from the pen. 
  Gently pull until the capped needle comes off. 
Note: If the needle is still on, replace the outer needle cover and try again. Be sure to apply 
pressure when unscrewing the needle. 
  Dispose of your used pen needles in a sharps container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or 
pharmacist and in accordance with local health and safety laws. Keep the sharps container out 
of the reach of children. Do not reuse needles. 
Step 13 Replace the pen cap 
  Replace the pen cap back onto your pen. 
  Do not recap the pen with a needle attached. 
 
If there is any medicine left in your pen, store in the refrigerator between uses. (See section 5 
“How to store Ngenla” of the Ngenla 60 mg pre-filled pen Package Leaflet).

Step 14 After your injection 
  Press lightly on the injection site with a clean cotton ball or gauze pad, and hold for a few 
seconds. 
  Do not rub the injection site. You may have slight bleeding. This is normal. 
  You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed. 
 
If your pen is empty or it has been more than 28 days after first use, throw it away even if it 
contains unused medicine. Throw away your pen in the sharps container.  
  To help you remember when to dispose of your pen you can write the date of first use on the 
pen label and below: 
Date of first use ______ / ______ / ______

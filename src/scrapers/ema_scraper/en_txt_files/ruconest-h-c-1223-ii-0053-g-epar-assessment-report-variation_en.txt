RMP - Other variation 
Extension of indication to include children in the treatment of acute angioedema attacks with hereditary 
angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. This is based on results from Study C1 1209 in 
children. In addition, final efficacy and safety data from the OLE phases of Studies C1 1304 and 1205 and 
the completed Study C1 1310 are submitted together with final study results of Studies C1 1207 and 
3201, concerning prophylactic treatment of HAE patients. Consequently, the product information has 
been updated (sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2).  
Furthermore, the company is requesting an extension for the completion of registry Study C1 1412. The 
current RMP (V 18.0) states that completion of the final study report for Study C1 1412 is anticipated 31 
March 2020. Although patient enrolment has increased, the study will not be completed on time. The MAH 
would therefore like to request an extension of the study completion date to submit the final report date 
for Study C1 1412 of 30 June 2022. In addition, as mentioned below, the RMP has also been aligned to 
RMP template version 2.0.1. 
The product information has also been updated to align with the most recent QRD template, version 10.1. 
The requested group of variations proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0343/2018 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the granting of a waiver.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0343/2018 was completed. The PDCO issued an 
opinion on compliance for the PIP EMA/PDCO/146070/2019.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rationale for the proposed change  
The proposed application represents an update of the indication to include children in the treatment of 
acute angioedema attacks with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. The 
applied indication was: Ruconest is indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults, 
adolescents, and children (aged 2 years and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 
esterase inhibitor deficiency. 
This application is based on results from Study C1 1209 performed in children of 2-13 years of age. 
Safety data from the OLE phases of Studies C1 1304 and 1205 and the completed Study C1 1310 are also 
submitted. Furthermore, the MAH provided final study results of Studies C1 1207 and 3201, investigating 
prophylactic treatment of HAE patients. Consequently, the product information has been updated.  
Furthermore, the MAH is requesting an extension of the deadline for the completion of registry Study C1 
1412. The current RMP (V 18.0) states that completion of the final study report for Study C1 1412 is 
anticipated 31 March 2020. Although patient enrolment has increased, the study will not be completed on 
time. The MAH would therefore like to request an extension of the study completion date in order to 
submit the final report date for Study C1 1412 of 30 June 2022.  
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition/clinical presentation 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has an estimated prevalence of (about) 1 out of 10,000. There is no known 
difference in prevalence across ethnic groups or gender. The European Register of Hereditary Angioedema 
reports a median age of symptom onset of 11 years and a median age of diagnosis at 26 years. In its 
most common form, hereditary angioedema presents as marked swelling of the face, mouth and/or 
airway (leading to difficulty breathing) and intestinal oedema (causing abdominal pain). Swelling can 
occur in any part of the body. Episodes may occur spontaneously or in response to triggers such as 
trauma, medications, viral illness and stress. The frequency of acute angioedema attacks varies widely 
but on average is approximately 4-5 times per year. Patients have reported as few as 0 and as many as 
50 attacks per year. C1 esterase inhibitor is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily. Its 
main function is the inhibition of the complement system to prevent spontaneous activation. Deficiency of 
C1 esterase inhibitor is associated with hereditary angioedema. In the absence of C1 inhibitor, excessive 
amounts of bradykinin are generated. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by increasing the leakage of 
fluid through the walls of blood vessels into body tissues. C1-inhibitor concentration in blood is about 
0.25 g/L. The blood concentration of C1-inhibitor is low in 85% of the cases of hereditary angioedema 
and in the remaining 15% the protein circulates in normal amounts but is dysfunctional. Mutations in the 
SERPING1 gene cause hereditary angioedema type I and type II. The SERPING1 gene provides 
instructions for making C1 inhibitor protein which blocks the activity of certain proteins that promote 
inflammation. Mutations that cause hereditary angioedema type I lead to reduced levels of C1 inhibitor in 
the blood while mutations that cause type II result in the production of a C1 inhibitor that functions 
abnormally.

Management 
The currently available treatments are described below 
Firazyr (Icatibant) is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin and is a selective 
competitive antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 receptor. Firazyr was approved by a centralised 
procedure in 2008 and received orphan designation. Firazyr is indicated for symptomatic treatment of 
acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, 
with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency. 
Berinert is an extract of human plasma that contains the active substance: human C1-esterase inhibitor. 
Berinert is indicated for management of Hereditary angioedema types I and II. Berinert was approved via 
mutual recognition procedure in 2009 in 23 European member states including Norway and Iceland. 
Cinryze contains the active substance C1 inhibitor derived from human plasma. It was approved by a 
centralized procedure in 2011. It is indicated for treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema 
attacks in adults, adolescents and children (2 years old and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
Takhzyro (Lanadelumab) is a monoclonal antibody therapy for the prevention of recurrent attacks of 
hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. It was approved by a centralised 
procedure in 2018 and received orphan designation. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ruconest (INN, conestat alfa) is the recombinant analogue of human C1 esterase inhibitor and is obtained 
from the milk of rabbits expressing the gene encoding for human C1 esterase inhibitor. The amino acid 
sequence of the recombinant form is identical to endogenous human C1 esterase inhibitor. Ruconest is 
presented as a powder for solution for injection and is intended for intravenous administration. 
Ruconest is currently indicated for treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with 
hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. There was no need to submit an updated ERA considering the population applied for in this 
extension of indication. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
Methods  
In study C1 1209 data was collected to characterize the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of 
Ruconest for children aged 2-13 years. The study is described in detail in the following section on clinical 
efficacy.  
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 11/55 
  
  
Pharmacokinetics were assessed by evaluation of functional C1INH concentrations over time for the first 
acute attack only. Functional C1INH pharmacokinetic concentrations were expressed as a percentage of 
normal, based upon a pool of plasma from healthy adult subjects (Standard Human Plasma sourced in 
Germany), which was originally set at 100%. The following PK parameters were derived (where 
appropriate) for C1INH activity in plasma from the concentration-time data using standard non-
compartmental methods: maximum plasma concentration of C1INH (Cmax) and area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from Presentation to 3 hours post-infusion (AUC0-3). 
Pharmacodynamics were assessed by evaluation of plasma concentrations of C4 over time for the first 
acute attack only. 
PK/PD was assessed using the ratio (2-4 hours post-dose: Baseline) of C4 versus the ratio (2-4 hours 
post-dose: Baseline) in functional C1INH for Attack 1 only. 
Results 
Pharmacokinetics 
For all patients who received a single iv administration of rhC1INH for the first attack, concentrations of 
functional C1INH were maximal for the majority of patients at 5 minutes post-dose with individual values 
ranging from 62% to 168% of normal. At 2 to 4 hours post-dose, functional C1INH concentrations were 
lower than 5 minutes post-dose values but above Baseline (Presentation) values for the majority of 
patients (range 28% to 81% of normal, based upon 18/20 patients). As per study inclusion criteria, all 20 
patients had concentrations of functional C1INH that were < 50% of normal at Baseline (Presentation). A 
total of 18/20 patients had concentrations of functional C1INH that were > 70% of normal (the lower 
limit of the normal range) at the 5 minutes and/or 2 to 4 hours post-dose time points. 
Functional C1INH pharmacokinetic concentrations were expressed as a percentage of normal, based upon 
a pool of plasma from healthy adult subjects (Standard Human Plasma sourced in Germany), which was 
originally set at 100%. Due to an inadequate number of sampling time points; the only PK parameters 
calculated in this study were AUC0-3 and Cmax. Upon administration of a single iv dose of rhC1INH 50 
U/kg for the first attack, arithmetic mean functional C1INH Cmax was 123.2% of normal (range 62% to 
168%), and AUC0-3 was 170.87% of normal (range 95.20% to 243.58%). 
At 2 to 4 hours post-dose, functional C1INH concentrations were lower than 5 minutes post-dose values 
but above baseline values for the majority of patients (range 28% to 81% of normal, based on 18/20 
patients. A total of 18/20 patients had concentrations of functional C1INH > 70% of normal (the lower 
limit of the normal range) at the 5 minutes and/or 2 to 4 hours post-dose time points.

Pharmacodynamics 
For all patients who received a single iv administration of rhC1INH for the first attack, arithmetic mean 
and individual patient C4 concentrations generally decreased from Baseline (Presentation) values at 5 
minutes post-dose before increasing above Baseline (Presentation) values at 2 to 4 hours post-dose, 
although individual patient data were variable. 
Mean C4 concentrations at Presentation were comparable across attacks, with the exception of an 
increased mean C4 concentration at Attack 5, which was however highly variable (73 μg/mL; 7.25 - 
187.00 μg/mL) and was measured only for 6 patients.

Set) 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Blood samples for the assessment of PK and PD were collected prior to administration, directly following 
infusion (5 minutes post-infusion) and one sample between 2 and 4 hours post-infusion. For each sample 
for PK C1INH activity and for PD C4 were measured. C4 data was additionally collected at presentation of 
each subsequent acute HAE attack. For PK, only for the first attack, Cmax and AUC0-3 were calculated.

Pharmacokinetics 
For the assessment of PK the functional C1INH activity was reported as percentage of normal based on a 
pool of plasma from healthy adult subjects which was originally set at 100%. The MAH clarified during the 
P46 procedure that a commercial standardized product was used (Standard Human Plasma sourced in 
Germany) and not a pool of samples from studies in healthy volunteers. The same standard was used for 
the analysis of PK samples in the adult studies.  
The collected data showed an increase to 123% (62-168%) 5 minutes post dose and values approaching 
baseline at 2-4 h post dose (Table 11-8). These findings are consistent with the results for adult and 
adolescent patients, where the 50 U/kg dose also restored the C1INH level to normal for about 2 hours. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The data for a single dose indicate that the C4 concentrations decrease from baseline towards 5 minutes 
post-dose and then increase above baseline at 2-4 hours post-dose. The measurements are, however, 
very variable. Nevertheless, the results are comparable to the previously presented data for adult and 
adolescent patients. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the results presented for the paediatric population are in accordance with the results obtained for 
the adult and adolescent patient population. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response studies were submitted. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The grouped variation is based on information obtained from different studies. The change of indication is 
based only on the results of study C1 1209 which is discussed in this section. All other submitted studies 
are briefly discussed in the introduction. Respective parts are discussed later in the clinical safety of this 
report as they only concern changes to the SmPC, Labelling or PL with regards to safety information and 
changes to the obligations and conditions of a marketing authorisation, including the RMP. 
Title: Study C1 1209: Open-label, Phase 2, single arm study to evaluate the safety, 
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of recombinant human C1 inhibitor for the 
treatment of acute attacks in paediatric patients with hereditary angioedema, from 2 up to and 
including 13 years of age 
Methods 
This study was an open-label, Phase 2, non-comparative, multinational, multicenter clinical study in 
paediatric patients from 2 up to and including 13 years of age, with a confirmed diagnosis of HAE. 
Patients were eligible for treatment with rhC1INH if they presented to the clinic within 5 hours of onset 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

with an acute attack of at least moderate severity (Investigator score [IS] of at least three) without signs 
of spontaneous regression.  
Patients received rhC1INH at a dose of 50 U/kg body weight up to a maximum of 4200 U. The 
reconstituted solution was administered as a slow intravenous (iv) injection over approximately 5 
minutes. The patients remained in hospital and were closely monitored in the study center for at least 4 
hours after study medication administration. 
At the discretion of the Investigator and depending upon the patient’s clinical response, an additional 
dose may have been given to patients following their initial dose as specified above. Not more than two 
doses were to be administered within 24 hours. 
The minimum observation period was 4 hours, after which the patient could leave if the Investigator 
judged the patient's condition well enough for discharge from the hospital. The Investigator scheduled a 
telephone contact at 24 hours (± 4 hours) after study medication administration. Follow up visits were 
planned at Day 28 (± 3 days) and Day 90 (±7 days). 
Patients could be treated for a maximum of 10 attacks, provided there was a minimum 24-hour interval 
between subsequent treated attacks, and as long as anti-rabbit epithelium (dander) immunoglobulin 
(Ig)E testing remained negative. 
Safety (including immunogenicity), PK/PD, and efficacy variables were assessed at regular time points 
before and after administration of study medication.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint:  
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 16/55 
  
  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to beginning of relief based on the Overall visual analog 
scale (VAS) score, where time of beginning of relief was assessed as the first time point at which the VAS 
score decreased by at least 20 mm at any eligible anatomical location compared to Baseline, with 
persistence of the decrease at the next time point. 
Secondary Endpoint:  
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms based on the Overall VAS, defined 
as the time, in minutes, from time of infusion to minimal symptoms (i.e. the time at which the Overall 
VAS score fell below 20 mm for all locations where VAS Scores were recorded). 
Exploratory Endpoints: 
• Time to beginning of relief based on IS 
• Time to minimal symptoms based on IS 
• Time to beginning of relief based on the treatment effect questionnaire (TEQ) 
• Time to minimal symptoms based on TEQ 
• Time to complete resolution 
• Therapeutic failure 
• Receipt of a second dose 
Sample size 
63 patients were screened: six of these patients were considered screen failures and 57 patients were 
eligible for treatment and included in the Screening Analysis Set. 20 patients have been treated. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study therefore no randomisation or blinding was performed. 
Statistical methods 
The following analysis sets were defined: 
-  Screening Analysis Set: All patients screened for the study, who at Screening were eligible for 
treatment 
-  Safety Analysis Set: The set of patients who received at least one dose of the study 
medication 
- 
- 
Intention to Treat Analysis Set (ITT): The set of patients who received at least one dose of 
the study medication, and for whom any efficacy data was available 
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: All patients in the ITT Analysis Set that had at least one attack 
without any major protocol violation that affected the efficacy assessments. Only data from 
the attacks without major protocol violations that affected the efficacy assessments were 
included for these patients. 
- 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Concentration Set: The subset of the Safety 
Analysis Set that had at least one PK/PD concentration measured 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 17/55 
  
  
- 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analysis Set: The subset of the Safety Analysis 
Set that had sufficient plasma concentration data. A patient was seen as having sufficient 
plasma concentration data if at least the Cmax could have been calculated 
For all continuous variables, summary statistics included the number of patients, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values. For categorical variables, per category, the 
absolute counts (n) and percentages (%) of patients with data, and if appropriate, the number of patients 
with missing data, were presented. 
Efficacy: The Intention to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set was the primary analysis set of interest in all efficacy 
analyses, and the primary, secondary, and exploratory efficacy analyses were repeated on the Per 
Protocol (PP) Analysis Set. Kaplan Meier (KM) analyses were performed for each of the time to event 
endpoints (time to beginning of relief and time to minimal symptoms defined using Overall VAS, IS, and 
TEQ, and time to complete resolution). Kaplan Meier analyses for time to beginning of relief and time to 
minimal symptoms using the Overall VAS score were repeated for first and last attacks. Kaplan Meier 
analyses for time to beginning of relief (IS and TEQ), time to minimal symptoms (IS and TEQ), and time 
to complete resolution were repeated for each attack. A bar chart was also presented to summarize 
therapeutic failure for both first and last attacks. 
Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD): PK (C1INH) and PD (C4) concentrations were 
summarized, listed, and presented in boxplots panelled by nominal time, and grouped by weight and 
panelled by nominal time. The ratio (2-4 hours: Baseline) in C4 versus the ratio (2-4 hours: Baseline) in 
functional C1INH was also summarized graphically.  
Safety: AEs were summarized by attack for the Safety Analysis Set and were categorized by System 
Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Laboratory parameters were summarized at each evaluation 
time point and as a change from Baseline. ECG, vital signs, diagnostic assay, and immunogenicity 
findings were summarized. Physical examination findings were listed.

Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
This was a multicenter study performed at 18 sites in the US, Israel. Italy, Poland, Romania, Germany, 
Macedonia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. 
First patient recruited: 17 January 2012 (first patient first visit) 
Last patient completed: 17 July 2017 (last patient last visit) 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration 
of Helsinki and in compliance with the protocol, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations and the applicable regulatory requirements, including the ICH-E11 
guideline "Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Paediatric Population". 
Amendments 
Four general protocol amendments have been implemented and one specific to the study sites in the 
Czech Republic. 
Protocol Amendments 1 (ensure consistent evaluation of the VAS and TEQ efficacy parameter and Anti-
rabbit IgE Ab testing was added to the immunology test panel at Day 28) and Protocol Amendment 2 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 19/55 
  
  
 
(correct the IS to reflect the more redefined analysis of attack locations and Anti-rabbit IgE Ab testing 
was added to the analysis section for consistency with the change made in Protocol Amendment 1) were 
implemented before study initiation.  
Protocol Amendment 3 (stipulate that pregnancies were to be reported as an SAE) was implemented after 
study initiation, and two patients were treated for a total of nine attacks under this protocol amendment 
only.  
Protocol amendment 4 consisted in a) update of assessments made during the 4-5 hour period after 
Presentation of an attack to ensure any medications previously reported as taken on an as needed basis 
were re-assessed and recorded since the onset of symptoms, b) addition of a time window for completion 
of the VAS and TEQ questionnaires at the 8 hour (window = 1 hour) and 24 hour (window = 4 hours) 
time points after Presentation of the attack. C) other changes in time windows for telephone contact and 
follow up visit, d) Definitions for relapse and spontaneous regression were added. 
One patient was treated under both Protocol Amendment 3 (four attacks) and Protocol Amendment 4 
(two attacks). The remaining patients in the study were treated under Protocol Amendment 4 for a total 
of 58 attacks, of these, two patients were also treated under local Protocol Amendment 1 (Czech Republic 
patients only) for five of the 58 attacks. 
Local amendment for the Czech Republic:  
This amendment was introduced upon request of the Czech Republic Competent Authorities (SUKL) and 
includes country specific updates in the sections of blood sampling procedures to ensure compliance with 
the guidelines, extension of the reasons for withdrawal and the usage of contraception is removed 
because sexual intercourse between persons under the age of 15 is illegal in the Czech Republic. 
Protocol deviations 
All twenty patients (100%) in the Safety Analysis Set reported at least one protocol deviation during the 
study. The majority of reported protocol deviations were considered minor. The most common protocol 
deviations in the Safety Analysis Set included deviations in study procedures (20 [100%] patients) and 
deviations in the visit schedule (16 [80%] patients), all of which were considered minor (Table 10-2).  
Major protocol deviations included:  
- 
- 
- 
not completing the VAS at a particular time point for an eligible attack location (five patients),  
failure to verify inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to study treatment (two patients),  
inadvertent disclosure of patient identity or private information by the study site to 
unauthorized persons/agencies (one patient),  
-  SAE not reported in a timely manner (one patient),  
- 
use of a disallowed concomitant medication/therapy (one patient). 
Six patients reported major protocol deviations that caused HAE attack data to be excluded from the PP 
Analysis Set.

Table 4: Summary of Protocol Deviations (Safety Analysis Set) 
Baseline data 
In the Safety Analysis Set, patient age at Presentation of Attack 1 ranged from 5 to 14 years, with a 
mean age of 8.20 years. There was a similar proportion of female (9/20 [45.0%]) and male (11/20 
[55.0%]) patients, and the majority of patients were Caucasian (95.0%) compared to one (5.0%) Black 
patient. As patient age increased with increasing number of attacks, mean height, weight, and Tanner 
stage generally increased across attacks in the Safety, ITT, and PP Analysis Sets.

A total of 63 patients gave informed consent (parental/legal guardian permission) to enter the study: six 
of these patients were considered screen failures as they failed to meet an inclusion criteria or met an 
exclusion criteria for study entry, and 57 (90.5%) were eligible for treatment and included in the 
Screening Analysis Set. Twenty (31.7%) of these patients received at least one dose of study medication 
and were included in the Safety Analysis and ITT Analysis Sets. Of these 20 patients, 18 (28.6%) patients 
were included in the PP Analysis Set. Two (3.2%) patients were excluded for the following reasons: One 
patient only received one study treatment (Attack 1) and reported a major protocol deviation that 
affected the efficacy assessments (Attack 1, Day 0 VAS/TEQ 8 hr post-dose assessment was not 
performed as the patient was asleep). The second excluded patient only received one study treatment 
(Attack 1) and reported a major protocol deviation that affected the efficacy assessments (Attack 1, 
VAS/TEQ 8 hr post-dose assessments were not completed). 
Six patients in the Safety and ITT Analysis Sets had study treatment data that were excluded from the PP 
Analysis Set due to major protocol deviations that affected the efficacy assessments. However, four of 
these patients were included in the overall PP Analysis Set as they had at least one other attack without a 
major protocol deviation that affected the efficacy assessments. 
The PK/PD Concentration Set included 20 (31.7%) patients and the PK/PD Analysis Set included 19 
(30.2%) patients (one patient was excluded as the 5 minutes post-dose C1INH and C4 assessment 
results were missing). 
Exposure: 
The planned volume of rhC1INH (50 U/kg body weight up to a maximum of 4200 U) was administered at 
every HAE attack administration and exposure to study medication was comparable across attacks.  
A total of 3/73 attacks were treated with a second dose of rhC1INH during the study: attacks requiring a 
second dose were reported by 2/20 (10.0%) patients in the ITT Analysis Set (one patient received a 
second dose of rhC1INH for Attacks 3 and 8, and one patient received a second dose of rhC1INH for 
Attack 3). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Evaluation 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms with persistence for the ITT Analysis Set estimated 
using KM analysis, based on Overall VAS decrease ≥ 20 mm, was approximately 60 minutes post-dose 
across repeated attacks. Results were generally similar in the PP Analysis Set. See table below.

Secondary Efficacy Evaluation 
The median time to minimal symptoms for the ITT Analysis Set estimated using KM analysis, based on 
Overall VAS decrease ≥ 20 mm, was approximately 120 minutes post-dose across repeated attacks. PP 
Analysis Set results were generally similar, with the exception of an increased median time to minimal 
symptoms for Attack 2 for the PP Analysis Set compared to the ITT Analysis Set (181.0 minutes versus 
122.0 minutes). (refer to tale below)

Ancillary analyses 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms based on IS for the ITT Analysis Set estimated using 
KM analysis, was approximately 60.0 minutes post-dose across repeated attacks. However, median 
values were lower for Attack 2 (median: 30.0 minutes [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.0 to 65.0 
minutes]) and Attack 3 (median: 39.0 minutes [95% CI 30.0 to 75.0 minutes]), and higher for Attack 7 
(median: 90.0 minutes [95% CI 60.0 minutes, upper limit of the 95% CI for the median not estimable]). 
Similar results were observed in the PP Analysis Set. 
Table 8 : Median Time (Minutes) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for Time to Beginning of 
Relief Based on Investigator Score (IS) (ITT Analysis Set) 
The median time to minimal symptoms based on IS for the ITT Analysis Set estimated using KM analysis 
varied across repeated attacks. The median time was approximately 120 minutes post-dose for Attacks 2, 
3, 4, 5, 9, and 10; 180 minutes post-dose for Attacks 7 and 8; and 240 minutes post-dose for Attacks 1 
and 6. PP Analysis Set results were generally similar, with the exception of an increased median time to 
minimal symptoms based on IS for Attack 2 for the PP Analysis Set compared to the ITT Analysis Set 
(183.5 minutes versus 127.0 minutes).

Table 9 Median Time (Minutes) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for Time to Miminal 
Symptoms Based on Investigator Score (IS) (ITT Analysis Set) 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms based on TEQ for the ITT Analysis Set estimated 
using KM analysis varied across repeated attacks. The median time was approximately 60 minutes post-
dose for Attacks 1, 3, 4, and 5; approximately 120 minutes post-dose for Attacks 2, 6, 8, 9, and 10; and 
180.5 minutes post-dose for Attack 7. PP Analysis Set results were generally similar, with the exception 
of an increased median time to minimal symptoms based on TEQ for Attack 4 for the PP Analysis Set 
compared to the ITT Analysis Set (90.0 minutes versus 65.0 minutes). 
Table 10: Median Time (Minutes) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) for Time to Beginning of 
Relief Based on Treatment Effect Questionnaire (TEQ) (ITT Analysis Set) 
The median time to minimal symptoms based on TEQ for the ITT Analysis Set estimated using KM 
analysis varied across repeated attacks. The median time was 66 minutes post-dose for Attack 4; 
approximately 120 minutes post-dose for Attacks 2, 3, 9, and 10; approximately 180 minutes post-dose 
for Attacks 1 and 8; and approximately 240 minutes post-dose for Attacks 5, 6, and 7. PP Analysis Set 
results were generally similar, with the exception of increased median time to minimal symptoms based 
on TEQ for the PP Analysis Set compared to the ITT Analysis Set for Attack 1 (241.0 minutes versus

The median time to complete resolution based on diary results for the ITT Analysis Set estimated using 
KM analysis varied across repeated attacks, with median values ranging from 100.0 minutes post-dose at 
Attack 9 to 1167.5 minutes post-dose at Attack 1. PP Analysis Set results were generally similar, with the 
exception of increased median time to minimal symptoms based on diary results for the ITT Analysis Set 
compared to the PP Analysis Set for Attack 1 (1167.5 minutes versus 270.0 minutes), Attack 4 (295.0

A total of 3/20 (15.0%) patients for 3/73 (4.1%) of attacks in the ITT Analysis Set had therapeutic failure 
during the study:  
• 
Two patients at Attack 1 due to the VAS time to beginning of relief of symptoms occurring 
later than 4 hours after Baseline,  
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 26/55 
  
  
 
 
• 
one patient at Attack 2 due to taking a disallowed concomitant medication (paracetamol) 
within 45 minutes before administration of rhC1INH, which was noted as a protocol 
deviation.  
None of the other patients in the ITT Analysis Set experienced therapeutic failure at any attack during the 
study. The majority of patients (90.0%) in the ITT Analysis Set did not receive a second dose of rhC1INH 
as treatment for any single HAE attack during the study. A total of 3/73 attacks were treated with a 
second dose of rhC1INH during the study: attacks requiring a second dose were reported by 2/20 (10%) 
patients in the ITT Analysis Set (one patient received a second dose of rhC1INH for Attacks 3 and 8, and 
one patient received a second dose of rhC1INH for Attack 3).

Supportive study(ies) 
The additional supportive studies are briefly described later in the safety part of this report. In this 
grouped variation, they are mainly supporting additional changes related to safety in the SmPC. The 
SmPC amendments will be described in the later sections of this report (Safety and Product information). 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study Design 
The presented study C1 1209 is the only study planned to study paediatric patients between 2 and 13 
years of age. It is an open-label, single arm study. Patients were treated with a single dose after 
presentation with an acute attack at the study centre. The patient remained in the study centre for close 
monitoring for at least 4 hours after study medication administration. Follow up was planned of at least 
90 days or until a subsequent HAE attack occurred (reset of follow-up for additional 90 days). Patients 
could be treated for a maximum of 10 attacks. The general design is considered adequate.

Paediatric patients received rhC1INH at a dose of 50 U/kg body weight up to a maximum of 4200 U, 
which is according to the SmPC. It is the same dose that is recommended for adults and adolescents. No 
specific dose adjustment for paediatric patients is intended nor was any adjustment applied. The study 
continued until at least 20 patients had been treated with Ruconest for at least one acute HAE attack. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria for paediatric patients were in general similar to the phase III studies 
in adult patients and are overall acceptable.  
However, one difference was noted: Only patients were included with an acute attack of at least 
moderate severity. This was defined by a so-called Investigator score [IS] of at least three. In contrast, 
the severity of the attack was estimated in the adult studies based on the VAS score (overall severity of 
angioedema symptoms of ≥ 50 mm at least 1 anatomical location at the time of evaluation (Time -1 
hours). Upon request during the preceding P46 procedure, the MAH clarified that the IS score was 
selected because it was regarded as more objective to assess the severity at presentation in the 
paediatric population.  
This explanation cannot be followed entirely as the VAS score has been applied successfully to paediatric 
patients before and the MAH used patient/parent(s)/legal guardian(s)-reported VAS scores for the 
primary endpoints. Further CHMP request, a comparison between IS (3 and 4 (no patients with IS 5 
enrolled)) and VAS (≥50mm) for all attacks was provided. All patients with IS 4 had also a VAS ≥50mm. 
Considering all attacks, 70% of patients with IS 3 had also a VAS ≥ 50mm, with similar results over 
individual attacks.  
In conclusion, the data indicate that both criteria are relatively comparable but patients with a minimal IS 
of 3 represent a slightly less severe affected population than based on the VAS criterion, which is 
considered acceptable to CHMP in this study setting. 
Objectives and Endpoints 
The primary objective was to evaluate the clinical safety and tolerability including immunogenicity in 
paediatric patients from 2 up to and including 13 years of age for the treatment of acute attacks of 
hereditary angioedema. Secondary objectives include the assessment of pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics and efficacy of Ruconest in this population.  
The chosen endpoints for the assessment of clinical safety (AEs, clinical laboratory parameters, vital 
signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination), tolerability (immunogenicity), Pharmacokinetics 
(Ruconest concentrations, Cmax and AUC 0-3) and Pharmacodynamics parameters (C4 level) are 
acceptable. Please refer to the respective sections.  
The endpoints for the efficacy assessment were grouped in primary, secondary and exploratory 
endpoints:  
The primary endpoint was time to beginning of relief based on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score. The 
secondary endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms also based on the Overall VAS score. Both 
endpoints correspond to those chosen in the adult studies, where also the VAS score was used and the 
criteria were considered clinically relevant. The VAS score has also been used and was accepted in the 
evaluation of treatment of HAE attacks in other applications for marketing authorisation. 
The exploratory endpoints besides time to complete resolution, therapeutic failure, and receipt of a 
second dose, measure also the time to the same events as the primary and secondary endpoints 
(beginning of relief, minimal symptoms) but are based on different scores: The Investigator Score (IS) 
and the treatment effect questionnaire (TEQ), which were both not applied in the adult studies. The MAH 
explained upon request during the preceding P46 procedure that due to the lack of an objective clinical or 
laboratory assessment method, the inclusion of different scores, combining patient reported outcomes 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 29/55 
  
  
focussing on different aspects (VAS, TEQ) and an Investigator assessment tool (IS), should effectively 
measure the severity of an attack and any improvement induced by therapy.  
The general study design is comparable to the studies in adult and adolescent patients and is considered 
acceptable for the objectives of the study. 
Population characteristics 
Height and weight are in a normal range for the screened and treated age group. Both increased with the 
number of treated attacks, which is in accordance with normal growth in children. Similar numbers of 
female (9) and male patients (11) were included which correspond to the general distribution between 
gender. Although no significant differences in incidence of HAE by race or ethnicity are known, only one 
patient was not Caucasian in the screening and the treated dataset. Also in the adult studies only a few 
non-Caucasian patients were included. 
Age 
The MAH intended to recruit children between 2 and 13 years of age. The 20 recruited and treated 
patients were however between 5 and 14 years old (mean 8.20) at presentation of attack 1. In the 
screening dataset patients’ age ranged from 2-13 years.  
The MAH discussed why no children between 2 and 4 years were treated. 20 children were enrolled in this 
age range but none were treated for events during the study. Only two presented in a study centre with 
untreated attacks at the age of 4 but did not meet the treatment criteria for this attack. No information is 
given on how many children between 2 and 4 years had events or their severity and if and how they were 
treated otherwise. The MAH explained that some parents had home treatment available and argued that 
this was preferable over a long drive to the centre. However, it is not clear how often this occurred or 
which alternative treatments have been used. Therefore, no treatment data is available for 2 to 4 year old 
patients.  
However, the need for treatment of acute HAE attacks is also present for 2 to 4 year old patients. This is 
also reflected by the PIP requirement to conduct a study in paediatric patients from 2 years of age and 
above. It is acknowledged that feasibility of a study in this age group is limited. The availability of 
patients is limited in this orphan setting, other approved products for the treatment of HAE attacks in 
patients from 2 years of age are available and complying with all requirements in clinical trials might be 
an additional burden for the parents/caregivers. This might be especially true for very young children, as 
indeed observed in study C1 1209 (screened patients in this age group but no treatment data available). 
The MAH was requested to address the lack of data in children 2 to 4 years of age and discuss the lower 
age limit of 2 years in the intended indication. A respective discussion has been presented by the MAH 
upon request including an additional literature review and popPK model with respective simulations: 
Although the documentation of the literature search is missing, the review seems to be comprehensive 
and includes relevant data for this application and supports the difficulties to recruit patients in the age 
range of 2 to 4 years of age. Although episodes occur already at this age, attack frequency increase 
between 3 and 6 years of age and again later. Further, abdominal attacks in this age group may be more 
difficult to diagnose as the symptoms are often similar to other common paediatric diseases. It has also 
been seen in study C1 1209 that it is difficult to include this young patient population also due to existing 
treatment alternatives.  
The popPK model predicted overall similar concentrations of Ruconest for adults, adolescents and children 
after administration of the recommended dose of 50 U/kg. Although a slight decrease in children < 5 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 30/55 
  
  
years of age was predicted, this would still translate into 90% of children reaching maximum 
concentration of 0.7 U/mL. The MAH argued that in case this would lead to an insufficient clinical 
response, therefore an additional dose could still be administered. This argumentation is agreed and the 
second dose is also implemented in the SmPC.  
Given the mode of action of Ruconest as enzyme replacement and assuming similar concentrations are 
achieved (as claimed by the popPK model and seen in children of 5-13 years), it is considered reasonable 
that the efficacy data derived from children (≥5 years), adolescents and adult patients can be 
extrapolated to younger children. Further, the registry study was also modified to include respective 
patients in order to gather data in the post marketing. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All endpoints were presented combined for all attacks and for each attack separately as well as for the 
last attack of each patient. Since only five patients were treated for more than five HAE attacks, the 
results for these later attacks may be less reliable but are in general comparable to the previous attacks. 
Primary endpoint 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms based on Overall VAS decrease ≥ 20 mm, was 
approximately 60 minutes post-dose across repeated attacks. Those results are similar to the results 
achieved in the adolescent and adult patient population.  
Secondary endpoint 
The median time to minimal symptoms based on Overall VAS was approximately 120 minutes post-dose. 
The results are also consistent over repeated attacks. Similar to the primary endpoint, those results are 
similar to the results in adults and adolescents.  
Exploratory endpoints based on IS and TEQ scores 
The MAH used different scores for the exploratory endpoints to cover slightly different angles of 
evaluation (patient, investigator, different body area etc.). The results for time to beginning of relief and 
to minimal symptoms differ depending on the score. While the results based on VAS score for the 
beginning of relief are quite consistent at 60 minutes, the results based on the IS score seem to estimate 
the time in general a bit less (30-90 min) and based on TEQ score the time seems to be estimated longer 
(60 -180 min). In addition, the results for time to minimal symptoms do not correspond between the 
different scores. Therefore, the benefit of these scores for the evaluation of severity and improvement is 
rather limited, although they cover slightly different aspects. 
Exploratory endpoint: time to complete resolution 
The time to complete resolution was based on patient diaries as patients were usually released 4 hours 
after initiation of treatment. The results are highly variable, ranging from 33 to over 2000. Although the 
data are highly variable the median of different attacks suggests a time between 100 and 300 minutes 
(median over all attacks: 262.5 min), which seems consistent with the observations in the adult studies. 
Although the data are limited, neither multiple affected regions, severity (measured as VAS score at 
baseline) nor age seem to have a relation to time to complete resolution. 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 31/55 
  
  
Exploratory endpoints: Therapeutic failure, second dose. 
Exploratory endpoints included also therapeutic failure and receipt of a second dose. It was noted that the 
patients classified as treatment failure did not receive a second dose, although the protocol states that a 
second dose can be administered if necessary. The MAH clarified upon request during the preceding P46 
procedure that the respective patients showed a treatment effect after 4 hours and did therefore not 
receive a second dose.  
A second dose was administered to two patients (10%) for three attacks, which is similar to results in 
adults (9% in study 1304).  
The treatment of 3/73 attacks in three patients (15%) were considered as treatment failure: two due to 
the VAS time to beginning of relief of symptoms occurring later than 4 hours after Baseline (both at 
attack 1) and one patient due to a protocol violation (paracetamol within 45 min before treatment, during 
attack 2). The number and reasons for therapeutic failure are similar to the adult study: In the adult 
study 1304, 11% (10/90) of the patients treated with the same dose of 50 U/kg were considered as 
treatment failure at the first attack, which is similar to the rate observed in study C1 1209. The rates of 
treatment failure for subsequent attacks is much lower in children than in adults. The only treatment 
failure after attack one in children in study C1 1209 occurred at attack 2 and was due to a protocol 
deviation and not due to delayed effect. Other studies in adults showed rates of 13-22% of therapeutic 
failure for attacks 2-5, mainly due to beginning of relief occurring after 4 hours after baseline.  
The results from study C1 1209 are consistent with the findings in previous clinical studies in adults and 
adolescents and demonstrate the efficacy of rhC1INH for the treatment of repeated acute HAE attacks in 
paediatric patients.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy in children from the age of 5 years old have been demonstrated based on the clinical data. There 
was no data provided for children between 2 to 4 years of age. Extrapolation of the efficacy in children 
from the age of 2 years is accepted based on the mechanism of action, the provided population PK model 
and the available clinical data from the age of 5 years. The simulation results based on the population PK 
model were further considered acceptable to support the dose recommendation in young patients (2-4 
years).  
Additional efficacy data will be collected post marketing in the ongoing Registry Study C1 1412 in order to 
further characterise efficacy in this population. This is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Safety data for in total 20 paediatric patients was submitted from study C1 1209 to support the change of 
indication to include children between 2 and 12 years. The study was part of the paediatric investigation 
plan and was intended to include patients from 2-13 years of age. The part of the submitted variation 
procedure concerning the extension of indication is based solely on the provided data from study C1 
1209. 
Further, additional data was submitted from different clinical studies to update the safety profile and 
support the variation procedure part of this grouped variation concerning the update of the SmPC and 
PIL. The clinical studies include two open label extension (OLE) phase studies (C1 1304 OLE and 1205 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 32/55 
  
  
OLE) of studies submitted with the initial application for marketing authorization, one additional 
randomized controlled trial including an OLE phase (C1 1310 RCT, OLE) and two studies performed for 
the prophylactic treatment of HAE patients (C1 1207 and 3201), which is not part of the current 
indication for Ruconest. The general information related to each study is described below in the respective 
section. The product information has been updated according to the new safety data.  
The presented data for both variations, update of the safety part of the SmPC and extension of indication 
is discussed separately below.  
2.5.2.  Safety results for paediatric patients (study C1 1209) 
Patient exposure 
20 patients were treated for a total of 73 attacks. This was the first study including the paediatric 
population below 12 years of age using the same posology as the one recommended for adolescents and 
adults. Patients could be treated for a maximum of 10 attacks with a minimal interval between attacks of 
24 hours. 
Adverse events 
Overall, in the Safety Analysis Set, 11 patients (55.0%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) after treatment with rhC1INH. The majority of TEAEs were of mild or moderate 
intensity, and not related to study treatment. Two patients (10.0%) reported TEAEs of severe intensity 
after study treatment for Attack 1 (abdominal pain [one patient] and vomiting [one patient]), and two 
patients (10.0%) reported TEAEs considered possibly related to study treatment (abnormal lymphocyte 
morphology events after study treatment for Attacks 1 and 2 [one patient] and Attack 4 [one patient]).  
The only possibly related TEAE was “abnormal lymphocyte morphology events“ and was reported four 
time for two patients after three attacks on a total of four occasions (attack 1,2 and 4 (twice)). The MAH 
clarified upon request during the preceding P46 procedure that all events occurred not immediately after 
treatment but a couple of days after (earliest 10 days) and that three of the four events occurred more 
than 30 days after treatment (31, 38, 55 days).  
There was no evidence of an increase in the TEAE frequency across attacks, although a higher proportion 
of patients experienced TEAEs after study treatment for Attack 1 (8/20 patients [40.0%]) and Attack 4 
(3/7 patients [42.9%]) compared to following treatment for the remaining attacks.  
Eight patients (40%) experienced a subsequent attack that required treatment before completing the 
follow-up visits. The number of subsequent attacks ranges from 1 up to 9.  
A total of 10/20 patients (50.0%) experienced TEAEs within 24 hours of completion of rhC1INH infusion 
and 8/20 patients (40.0%) experienced TEAEs within 28 days of completion of rhC1INH infusion. The 
most common TEAEs across all attacks were in the SOCs of infections and infestations (7/20 patients 
[35.0%]), gastrointestinal disorders (4/20 patients [20.0%]), and investigations (3/20 patients [15.0%]), 
and included nasopharyngitis, vomiting, viral infection, and abnormal lymphocyte morphology. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths during the study.  
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 33/55 
  
  
Overall, in the Safety Analysis Set, three patients experienced nine treatment-emergent SAEs (TESAEs) 
that occurred after study treatment for Attacks 1, 2, or 4. The most common TESAEs were grouped as 
SOC infections and infestations and included bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and viral infection.  
No AEs of special interest were reported during this study (such as type I hypersensitivity reactions 
against IgE, type III hypersensitivity reactions against rhC1INH, induction of acquired angioedema, or 
thromboembolic complications). 
Laboratory findings 
Treatment with rhC1INH did not result in any significant trends in routine clinical laboratory safety 
parameter data across attacks. For two patients clinically significant abnormalities during the study were 
reported (one patient had a high value for erythrocyte sedimentation rate at Day 28 after treatment for 
Attack 3, and one patient had a high value for monocytes and low value for white blood cell count on Day 
28 after treatment for Attack 10).  
Two patients (10.0%) in the Safety Analysis Set reported TEAEs of abnormal lymphocyte morphology that 
were considered possibly related to rhC1INH (one patient after study treatment for Attacks 1 and 2, and 
one patient at two occasions after study treatment for Attack 4). The MAH clarified upon request that all 
events occurred not immediately after treatment but a couple of days after (earliest 10 days) and that 
three of the four events occurred more than 30 days after treatment (31, 38, 55 days). 
Most abnormal physical examination findings reported during the study were related to HAE or unrelated 
to study drug (e.g. caries).  
Most patients had normal ECG results at Presentation of attack and post-infusion. Abnormal but not 
clinically significant ECG results were detected for four patients. The ECG values returned to normal for all 
but one patient, which experienced slight sinus tachycardia which was also present at Presentation of 
attack. 
There were no further clinically meaningful changes in any of the vital signs parameters during the study. 
As patient age increased with increasing number of attacks, mean weight at Presentation generally 
increased across attacks. 
Immunogenicity 
Hypersensitivity to host related impurities (HRI) is an identified risk for Ruconest, also included in the 
SmPC. Therefore, patients were excluded if a history of allergy to rabbits or rabbit-derived products was 
known. An additional assessment of immunogenicity reaction was also performed in study C1 1209. The 
assessment of immunogenicity reactions was performed based on the blood samples collected also for the 
PK and PD analysis. The samples were tested for anti- C1INH and anti-HRI antibodies (Abs). Sporadic, 
transient immune responses to rhC1INH and HRI were observed, but with no associated clinical findings. 
Two patients had confirmed Abs against C1INH at screening or presentation of attack. Eight patients 
experienced confirmed anti-HRI Abs. None of the patients developed neutralizing Abs to C1INH and no 
impact of immunogenicity on clinical efficacy or safety was observed. No AEs concerning anaphylactic 
reactions were observed by any patient in this study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to TEAEs during the study. 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 34/55 
  
  
Five patients discontinued the study prematurely; all withdrew their consent. The reported reasons 
include: too old for the study, no longer interested to continue, left the country, personal reasons and 
preferred to treat attacks otherwise. 
2.5.3.  Safety results from additional studies  
Data from studies C1 1304 OLE, C1 1205 OLE and from the completed Study C1 1310 (RCT and OLE) 
have been submitted for this variation procedure. Additional safety data are included from Studies C1 
1207 and 3201 for the prophylactic treatment of HAE patients, which are not included in the current 
indication for Ruconest. The product information has been updated accordingly. 
All studies are described briefly below.  
a) Study C1 1304 OLE: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Phase 3 Study Of The 
Efficacy And Safety Of Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor For The Treatment Of Acute Attacks In 
Patients With Hereditary Angioedema: Open Label Extension (OLE) phase.  
Of note the results of the double-blind phase have been assessed during the initial marketing 
authorization. In this application, the MAH is providing in this application the open label phase for review. 
Methods 
The study was performed in Italy, Spain, UK, Israel, Romania and Argentina from 06 September 2007 
until 13 October 2009 (First patient treated - Last patient completed). 
The open label extension study included 57 patients ≥ 16 years of age that have received in total 194 OLE 
treatments. 
Study objective 
The objectives of the OLE phase of the study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy as well 
as pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of rhC1INH in the open-label treatment of 
subsequent attacks of HAE. 
Study participants/Inclusion criteria 
During the double-blind phase of the study, hereditary angioedema (HAE) patients screened and found to 
be eligible, were randomized to receive either rhC1INH or Saline in a ratio of 1:1 when they presented 
with an eligible acute angioedema attack. After the double-blind phase of the study, HAE patients with 
subsequent eligible acute angioedema attacks could be treated repeatedly with open-label rhC1INH in the 
OLE phase of the study. In addition, screened patients with an eligible acute angioedema attack who had 
not previously participated in the double-blind phase of the study could be treated in the OLE phase. 
Treatments 
In the OLE phase, the treatment consisted of a fixed dose of 2100 U per attack with the provision to 
administer one or two additional vials within 4 hours after administration of the first vial. Patients 
received study medication by slow iv injection in 2-3 minutes. The maximum amount of rhC1INH that 
could be given to a patient for a single attack was 3 vials (6300U). 
Study endpoints 
Although the efficacy results of this study are not part of this assessment the endpoints are briefly 
described here for completeness:  
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the beginning of relief, assessed using overall 
severity visual analog scale (VAS) scores, where beginning of relief was defined as a decrease in 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 35/55 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
VAS score of ≥ 20 mm at an eligible anatomical location compared to baseline (Time = 0, just 
prior to study medication infusion). If a patient had an attack at more than one eligible location, 
the earliest relief of these locations was considered. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms, where ‘minimal symptoms’ 
was defined as an overall severity VAS score of <20 mm in severity of symptoms for all 
anatomical locations of an attack. 
The main exploratory efficacy variables were therapeutic failure and time to the beginning of 
relief based on Investigator’s score (IS). 
• 
• 
Safety and Tolerability: Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, safety laboratory 
parameters and immunogenicity. 
b) Study C1 1205 OLE: Randomized, Placebo-Controlled (saline), Double-Blind Phase II Study 
of the Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Acute 
Attacks in Patients with Hereditary Angioedema:  
The results of the double-blind phase have been a part of the data submitted for the initial marketing 
authorization.  
Methods 
The OLE phase of the study was performed in America and Canada from 01 March 2007 until 20 January 
2010 (First patient treated - Last patient completed).  
Study objectives 
The objectives of the OLE phase of the study were to assess the safety, tolerability and effects of 
rhC1INH in treating subsequent attacks of HAE. 
Study participants 
During the double-blind phase of the study, HAE patients screened and found to be eligible were 
randomized to receive rhC1INH at 50 U/kg, rhC1INH at 100 U/kg or saline in a ratio of 1:1:1 when they 
presented with an eligible acute angioedema attack After treatment in the double-blind phase of the 
study, patients with subsequent eligible HAE attacks could be treated on an unlimited number of 
occasions with open-label rhC1INH (50 U/kg). Furthermore, after the double-blind phase of the study 
closed, the OLE phase of the study was open for HAE patients that presented with an eligible angioedema 
attack, whether or not they had participated in the randomized controlled phase of the study. New 
patients could also be screened and treated in the OLE phase.  
Treatments 
In the OLE phase, treatment consisted of rhC1INH at 50 U/kg per attack with the provision to administer 
an additional 50 U/kg dose within 4 hours after administration of the first treatment. 
Patients received study medication by slow iv injection at an approximate rate of 6mL/min. The maximum 
amount of rhC1INH that could be given to a patient for a single attack was 100 U/kg. 
This study included 62 patients ≥ 12 years that received in total 168 treatments. 
Study endpoints 
Although the efficacy results of this study are not part of this assessment the endpoints are briefly 
described here for completeness:  
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to the beginning of relief, assessed using overall 
severity visual analog scale (VAS) scores, where beginning of relief was defined as a decrease in

VAS score of ≥20 mm (with persistence of the decrease at the next assessment time) at an 
eligible anatomical location compared to Baseline (Time 0, just prior to study medication 
infusion). If a patient had an attack at more than 1 (eligible) location, the earliest relief/resolution 
of these locations was considered 
• 
• 
The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms, where ‘minimal symptoms’ 
was defined as an overall severity VAS score of <20 mm in severity of symptoms for all 
anatomical locations of an attack. 
The main exploratory efficacy variables were therapeutic failure and time to the beginning of 
relief based on Investigator’s score (IS). 
Safety and Tolerability: Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluation of treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, safety laboratory 
parameters and immunogenicity. 
C) Study C1 1310 RCT and OLE: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled 
Study with an Open-Label Extension Evaluating the Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of 
Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Acute Attacks of Angioedema in 
Patients with HAE. 
Methods 
This study was conducted in a total of 26 centers in 10 countries from 30 January 2011 (FPFV) until 26 
September 2012 (RCT LPLV) and 07 March 2013 (OLE LPLV). 
A total of 75 eligible patients (≥13 years of age (≥18 years for patients outside the United States or 
Canada)) were centrally randomized (3:2) to receive either intravenous (iv) rhC1INH or saline in a 
double-blind fashion (44 rhC1INH; 31 saline). 73 patients completed the scheduled visits in the RCT 
Phase (42 rhC1INH; 31 saline) and 44 patients entered the Entered OLE Phase. 
Study Objectives: 
•  To evaluate efficacy and safety of rhC1INH at a dose of 50 IU/kg when used for the treatment of 
acute angioedema attacks in patients with HAE 
•  To assess efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of rhC1INH when used for the repeat treatment of 
acute angioedema attacks in patients with HAE 
Treatment 
A dose consisted of rhC1INH 50 IU/kg for patients <84 kg, or a dose of rhC1INH 4200 IU (2 vials) for 
patients ≥84 kg administered as slow IV injection over a period of approximately 5 minutes  
Each patient started with a screening visit and was followed for at least 90 days after treatment or until 
another open-label treatment for a subsequent HAE attack. Treatment for a subsequent attack reset the 
follow-up assessment schedule for an additional 90 days. 
Rescue medication (open-label rhC1INH) may have been provided under respective circumstances. 
Study endpoints 
Although the efficacy results of this study are not part of this assessment the endpoints are briefly 
described here for completeness:  
•  Primary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to beginning of relief of symptoms 
at the primary attack location (based on Treatment Effect Questionnaire [TEQ]). 
•  Secondary Endpoint: The secondary efficacy endpoint was the time to minimal symptoms at all 
locations based on TEQ. 
• 
In addition, several exploratory endpoints were defined including evaluation based on different

scores, treatment failure etc. 
Safety: Safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory parameters, 
immunogenicity, immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing, vital signs, physical examination, change in weight, 
Wells score, and ultrasound. 
d) Study C1 1207 An Open-label exploratory Phase II study of the safety and Prophylactic 
Effect of a weekly 50 U/kg rhC1INH treatment in Asymptomatic patients with hereditary 
C1INH deficiency (HAE). 
Methods 
25 patients (≥18 years) were treated in three sites Romania, Israel and Poland from 26 August 2009 
(FPFV) until 19 April 2010 (LPLV). 
The patients received once weekly administration of rhC1INH at 50 U/kg for 8 weeks, with a 2 weeks run-
in period before the first administration and a 42 days follow-up period after the last administration. 
Study objectives 
• 
Primary objective: To evaluate the occurrence of HAE attacks under prophylactic administration of 
rhC1INH (50 U/kg, once a week) 
•  Secondary objectives: To evaluate the PK/PD parameters, safety and immunogenicity on repeated 
administration of rhC1INH 
Study endpoints 
Although the efficacy and PK/PD results of this study are not part of this assessment the endpoints are 
briefly described here for completeness:  
- 
- 
Efficacy: Incidence of documented HAE attacks during treatment period 
Pharmacokinetics/ Pharmacodynamics: - AUC0-4, Cmax and Tmax of functional C1INH, antigenic 
C1INH and C4 
Immunology: Antibodies against C1INH, host related impurities, rabbit dander and cow milk 
Safety: Safety was assessed by evaluating Adverse events, thrombogenic effects, Vital signs, Significant 
changes from baseline of routine haematology and biochemistry blood test results and recorded ECG 
data. 
e) Study C1 3201: A Phase 2 Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, 3-
Period Crossover Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor 
in the Prophylaxis of Angioedema Attacks in Patients with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) 
Methods 
32 patients (≥13 years) were treated in 12 sites in eight countries from 29 December 2014 (FPFV) until 3 
May 2016 (LPLV). Eligible patients with a history of frequent HAE attacks (≥ 4 attacks per month for 3 
consecutive months) were enrolled and randomized to one of six treatment sequences in an equal 
allocation ratio. Each patient was to receive three 4-week periods of study treatment twice weekly, 
according to the assigned treatment sequence, with a 1-week washout period between treatment periods 
Study objectives: 
- 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of recombinant human C1 inhibitor 
(rhC1INH) in the prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020

- 
The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant human C1 
inhibitor (rhC1INH) in the prophylaxis of angioedema attacks in patients with HAE. 
Treatments 
Patients received hC1INH 50 IU/kg (to a maximum of 4200 IU for patients ≥ 84 kg) or placebo (saline), 
administered as a slow IV injection at the study center over approximately 5 minutes (≤ 10 minutes), 
twice weekly according to the assigned treatment sequence. 
Study endpoints 
Although the efficacy results of this study are not part of this assessment the endpoints are briefly 
described here for completeness:  
- 
Primary Endpoint: Monthly HAE attack rate, defined as the number of HAE attacks during each 
treatment period normalized by the number of days the patient participated in that period. 
-  Secondary Endpoint: Clinical response, defined as a ≥50% reduction in the number of attacks from 
treatment with placebo to treatment with rhC1INH. The number of attacks is normalized by the 
number of days the patient participated in that period. 
- 
In addition, several exploratory endpoints were defined including reduction, duration, severity or 
absence of the attacks, etc. 
Safety: Safety was assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory parameters 
(hematology, biochemistry, coagulation), immunogenicity, vital signs, and physical examination. 
Patient exposure 
Study C1 1304 OLE: This study included 57 patients received in total 194 OLE treatments. 
Study C1 1205 OLE: This study included 62 patients that received in total 168 treatments. 
Study C1 1310 RCT: In this study, 74 patients were treated for an HAE attack (primary attack location: 
45% peripheral, 38% abdominal, 11% facial, and 7% oropharyngeal-laryngeal), with 56 patients exposed 
to rhC1INH either as randomized therapy or rescue medication. Including rescue medication, the mean 
(SD) total dose of rhC1INH administered during the RCT Phase was 52.74 (11.278) IU/kg for patients 
<84 kg and 50.00 (19.609) IU/kg for patients ≥84 kg.  
Study C1 1310 OLE: During the OLE Phase, 44 patients were treated for 224 attacks; an additional dose 
of rhC1INH was administered for nine of 224 attacks.  
In total, the safety database including the presented studies amounts to 201 symptomatic patients 
treated for 691 attacks. In addition, in the RCT trials four patients received rescue medication in the 
placebo group and are subsequently also included in the all safety dataset. 
In studies C1 1207 and C1 3201 25 and 32 patients received prophylactic treatment with Ruconest.  
Adverse events 
Overall, 117 (57%) patients reported at least 1 TEAE (C1 1304 OLE: 27 (47%), C1 1205 OLE: 39 (63%), 
C1 1310 RCT: 18/56 [32%] OLE: 30 (68%)). There was no increase in TEAEs with repeated treatments. 
Most events were mild to moderate in severity in all presented studies.  
Severe AEs were reported in a few patients in all studies and none were considered to be treatment 
related (C1 1304 OLE: 3 AEs in 3 patients; C1 1205 OLE: 14 AEs in 7 patients; C1 1310 RCT: 3 AEs in 3 
patients (2 Ruconest, 1 placebo); OLE: 9 AEs in 6 patients) 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 39/55 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In studies for the prophylactic treatment: 
In study C1 1207 a total of 30 treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 13 patients (52%). 
Most were mild or moderate but two events were of severe intensity: appendicitis and laryngeal edema. 
The later event resulted in the death of the respective patient. The event was judged as not related to 
study drug. Based on the narratives provided by the MAH this can be followed. 
In study C1 3201 24 TEAEs were reported for 10 patients (34.5%) during twice weekly treatment, 18 
TEAEs in 13 patients (44.8%) during once weekly treatment, and 15 TEAEs in 8 patients (28.6%) during 
placebo treatment. Almost all TEAEs were of mild or moderate severity. Two events were reported as 
severe: Abdominal pain during twice weekly treatment and Nasopharyngitis during once weekly 
treatment. 
The most frequently reported SOCs in all studies (including the studies for prophylactic treatment) were 
Gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea), Infections and infestations 
(nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection) and Nervous System Disorders (headache, dizziness). 
Those adverse events are adequately mentioned in the SmPC.  
Treatment related TEAEs 
Four (C1 1304 OLE) and eight (C1 1205 OLE) patients experienced possible related TEAE, as determined 
by the investigator, but none of them required any treatment. The reported AEs include: 
diarrhoea (3 events), nausea (2 events), paresthesia (2 events), vertigo, dysuria, vesicular rash, 
dizziness, persistent increase of gamma-GT, headache, throat irritation, abdominal discomfort and 
hypersensitivity (1 event each). 
In the RCT phase of study 1301 only one patient in the rhC1INH group experienced TEAEs assessed as 
related to treatment by the Investigator, which were headache, skin burning sensation and back pain.  
In the OLE phase, four (9%) patients experienced a total of 15 treatment-related TEAEs during the OLE 
Phase including flatulence (4 events), diarrhea (3 events), lacrimation increased (2 events), back pain, 
chills, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, pruritus, and rash (1 event each). 
Study C1 1207: four events were considered possibly drug-related by the investigator. All these events 
were of mild intensity: dry mouth, dizziness, hypotension, anxiety.  
Study C1 3201: related TEAEs (relationship possible or probable) were reported for 2 patients during 
twice weekly treatment: Fatigue (mild and possibly related) and headache (mild and possibly related). 
Overall, the described (possibly) treatment-related AEs have been currently - and are also with the 
applied changes - appropriately reflected in the SmPC.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths due to TEAEs in any of the additionally presented studies.  
One patient died in study C1 1207 (for prophylactic treatment) due to laryngeal oedema, which was 
considered as not related to study drug.  
Serious adverse events 
Study C1 1304  
Two SAEs (acute myocardial infarction 70 days post treatment and tonsillitis) were reported and both 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

Page 40/55 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were considered not related. One other significant adverse event of spontaneous abortion was considered 
unlikely related to study medication. 
Study C1 1205 
Twenty serious TEAEs were reported in 10 patients. Thirteen SAEs were HAE attacks (11 single HAE 
attacks and 2 HAE attacks combined with other SAEs) reported in 8 patients. The other 7 treatment-
emergent SAEs were reported in 4 patients included: 1 patient with severe vertigo, 1 patient with a 
severe pneumonia and peripheral oedema, 1 patient with a moderate “hypersensitivity reaction”, and 1 
patient experiencing an urinary tract infection with sepsis on two occasions (mild and severe, 
respectively). All SAEs resolved and none was related to treatment in the Investigator’s opinion except for 
the “hypersensitivity reaction”, which was deemed to be possibly-related to treatment. Laboratory data 
suggest that the event was not an IgE-mediated reaction. 
Study C1 1310 RCT 
Three patients experienced a total of five SAEs during the RCT Phase, only one of which was treatment-
emergent (severe abdominal hernia 79 days after administration of study medication). The event was 
assessed as not related to the study drug by the Investigator. 
Study C1 1310 OLE 
One patient experienced a serious TEAE of a new HAE attack approximately 25 days after the last 
administration of rhC1INH (for Attack 13). The attack was moderate in severity, required hospitalization 
and resolved after 52.5 hours. The Investigator considered the event to be not related to study drug. 
Study C1 1207 
Two serious adverse events were reported in two patients: laryngeal oedema and acute appendicitis. The 
reported SAE of laryngeal oedema was fatal. Both SAEs events were considered as not related to study 
drug. Based on the narratives provided by the MAH this can be followed.  
Study C1 3201 
A single treatment-emergent SAE was reported during twice weekly treatment (Phimosis), and was 
judged as being unrelated to the study drug. The event was an SAE due to a brief hospitalization. 
AEs of special interest 
AEs of special interest were defined as type I hypersensitivity reactions against IgE, type III 
hypersensitivity reactions against rhC1INH, induction of acquired angioedema, or thromboembolic 
complications. No such events occurred in any of the presented studies. 
Laboratory findings 
Treatment with rhC1INH did not result in clinically relevant mean changes in vital signs, ECG, and routine 
clinical laboratory safety parameters in all studies. Occasional clinically relevant changes were reported 
but all considered as not related to study drug. 
In Study 1310, D-dimer concentrations were measured at Baseline, 2 h, and Day 7 following study drug 
administration in the RCT and OLE Phases of the study. In the RCT Phase of Study 1310, Baseline and 2-h 
D-dimer concentrations were elevated in both the rhC1INH and saline groups. By Day 7, median values 
decreased in both groups. Similar trends were observed in the ongoing OLE Phase of this study. As 
reported in the literature, the early high D-dimer concentrations likely reflect the ongoing HAE attack, 
which is associated with activation of both coagulation and fibrinolysis. Finally, no thromboembolic events 
were reported in the study.

Immunogenicity 
In the integrated immunosafety analysis, antibodies against conestat alfa, plasma-derived C1-INH, and 
HRI were assessed in samples collected from 205 patients with HAE treated for 704 acute attacks 
participating in Studies C1 1202/1203, and the RCT and OLE phase of C1 1304, 1205, and 1310. Of the 
1784 planned samples (excluding placebo-treated attacks), 1696 samples (95%) were collected and 
analyzed. 
It showed that the frequency of initial ELISA results above cut-off for antibodies against C1-INH was low 
and was similar for pre-exposure (Attack 1 at screening: 2%, Attack 1 at baseline: 1%) and post-
exposure (1-3%) samples. Results above cut-off tended to be isolated or transient occurrences. 
Although no information in the SmPC was updated based on immunogenicity data the data from from 
studies C1 1207 and C1 3201 in asymptomatic patients is added here for completeness:  
C1 1207: Occasional antibodies to C1INH were observed, but no neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies to 
Host Related Impurities were found at any point in time in 11/25 patients without associated 
clinical symptoms. 
Study C1 3201: For anti-HRI, positive results were observed for 19 patients (67.9%) at the last study 
visit (follow-up), of which 18 were confirmed.  
None of the results for IgE against rabbit epithelium were positive. 
For rhC1INH-specific IgG, positive results were observed 4 patients at follow-up (14.3%, all confirmed). 
For rhC1INH-specific IgM, no positive results were observed at follow-up.  
No neutralizing antibodies were observed. Observed anti-C1INH and anti-HRI antibodies were not 
associated with adverse clinical findings. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no discontinuations due to adverse events in the study. 
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety in children (study C1 1209) 
Study C1 1209 included 20 paediatric patients between 5 and 14 years. Although children between 2 and 
4 years of age were screened, none were treated during the study resulting in a lack of data for this 
population. The need for treatment of acute HAE attacks is also present for 2 to 4 years old patients. This 
is also reflected by the PIP requirement to conduct a study in paediatric patients from 2 years of age and 
above. It is acknowledged that feasibility of a study in this age group is limited. 
Upon further request the MAH provided arguments why data derived from older patients (>5 years) could 
be extrapolated to the young children (2-4 years). Although such extrapolation might be possible for 
efficacy of Ruconest, some safety concerns remain which could not be derived from older patient 
populations. The MAH agreed that it is not possible to determine the risk and potential clinical 
presentation of hypersensitivity to rabbit antigens in children (2-4 years) due to the lack of data. Further, 
there is no literature to support any assumption in this matter.  
However, the immunogenicity results of children between 5 and 14 years of age were consistent with the 
data observed in previous studies in adults and adolescents. Only sporadic, transient immune responses 
to rhC1INH and HRI were observed, but with no associated clinical findings. Hypersensitivity to host 
related impurities (HRI) is already an identified risk for Ruconest and included in the SmPC in section 4.4.  
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 42/55 
  
  
 
 
 
Consequently, it is agreed with the MAH to introduce additional recommendations of monitoring of 
potential hypersensitivity reactions in all children, including also those between 2 and 5 years of age 
during and after the treatment, considering the absence of clinical data in this population. This is also in 
line with current recommendations for the adult and adolescent populations.  
Patients could be treated for subsequent attacks before the follow up visits were completed, resulting in 
the reset of the follow up schedule based on the most recent treatment. This procedure had no influence 
on efficacy and safety data, since no trends have been observed across attacks. However, the available 
data is rather limited with eight patients and no definite conclusion can be drawn.  
Adverse events (AEs) 
11 patients (55.0%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) most of mild or 
moderate intensity, and not related to study drug. Only two were reported as of severe intensity 
(abdominal pain and vomiting). These TEAEs have also been observed in similar frequency in the adult 
studies and have already been included in the SmPC.  
The only possibly related TEAE that occurred in study C1 1209 was “abnormal lymphocyte morphology 
events“. In total four events were reported for two patients. The event was not reported in the adult 
studies, however, it is not clear whether lymphocyte morphology was investigated. A few cases of low 
lymphocyte counts were reported in the adult studies but balanced between treatment arms and all were 
considered not clinically significant. All events occurred not immediately after treatment but at least 10 
days later. Overall, the MAH´s evaluation that these events are not related to treatment is supported.  
No deaths occurred during the study. Nine SAEs were reported for a total of three patients which were 
mainly infections and infestations, e.g. bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and viral infection.  
AEs of special interest were defined according to the known safety profile of Ruconest but none occurred 
during the study. 
Discontinuations 
Five patients discontinued the study prematurely; all withdrew their consent. No patients discontinued 
due to TEAEs.  
Additional data provided for patients who stated that they withdrew their consent indicated that the 
treatment was effective and no AEs occurred around the time of their decision. Therefore, no concern 
arises that their withdrawal of consent was related to safety or signs of lack of efficacy.  
Laboratory values 
No clinically relevant changes possibly related to study drug in vital signs or physical examinations were 
observed during the study and no trends in laboratory values were observed across attacks. 
Immunogenicity 
Hypersensitivity to host related impurities (HRI) is an identified risk for Ruconest, also included in the 
SmPC. Therefore, patients were excluded if a history of allergy to rabbits or rabbit-derived products was 
known. In study C1 1209 sporadic, transient immune responses to rhC1INH and HRI were observed, but 
with no associated clinical findings. Furthermore, none of the patients developed neutralizing Abs to 
C1INH and no impact of immunogenicity on clinical efficacy or safety was observed. No AEs concerning 
anaphylactic reactions were observed by any patient in this study. 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 43/55 
  
  
Overall, the reported safety profile observed in the paediatric population is consistent with the known 
safety profile for adult patients. 
Update of safety data based on additional data from other studies 
In this grouped variation procedure, amendments to the product information based on updated safety 
data were introduced. For this purpose, data from two open label extension (OLE) phases of randomized 
controlled studies presented at the initial marketing authorization procedure and from an additional study 
(RCT with OLE) have been submitted. Additional safety data are included from two studies for the 
prophylactic treatment of HAE patients, which are not included in the current indication for Ruconest.  
With the above safety data, the total safety database increased to 205 patients treated for 691 attacks.  
In addition, 57 asymptomatic patients received prophylactic treatment with Ruconest.  
One patient died in study C1 1207 (for prophylactic treatment) due to laryngeal oedema, which was 
considered not related to study drug. Overall, the occurrence of SAEs is limited and both frequency and 
AEs are consistent with the previously presented safety profile.  
Minor changes of the SmPC were considered necessary resulting from the above submitted data: 
dizziness has been added to the list of uncommon adverse events and included in section 4.7. Other 
changes related to the frequency of nausea (change from uncommon to common) and headache (change 
from common to uncommon) in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
In addition to the changes of frequencies of adverse events in section 4.8 of the SmPC, the MAH updated 
the number of treated patients and attacks in section 5.1 of the SmPC.   
In addition, minor update in the figures for study C1 1205 were introduced in the SmPC section 5.1 by 
the MAH which are agreed upon. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Extension of indication 
The presented study C1 1209 was appropriately designed for the intended objectives and the presented 
results indicate similar efficacy and a similar safety profile in children compared to the results observed in 
adult and adolescent patients 
The safety data in children from the age of 5 years support an approval in this patient population. 
Extrapolation of the safety data to younger patients (2-4 years) can be accepted provided that further 
safety data will be provided post approval, to which the MAH agreed. The registry protocol of Study C1 
1412 has been appropriately modified to include collection of data in children from 2 to 4 years.  
The need for monitoring of safety in patients from 2 to 4 years of age is essential considering the absence 
of safety data in this population.  
Information on the lack of clinical data in children less than 2 years is also introduced in section 4.2 of the 
SmPC. 
Variation to update the safety data in section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
The additional safety data presented for adult and adolescent patients are consistent with the data 
presented for the initial marketing authorization. No new or unexpected safety concerns have been 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020

identified. The requested amendments on the frequency of ADRs in the SmPC section 4.8 and correction 
of figures and update of information in section 5.1 are acceptable.  
Additionally the delay in submission of the final study results of the registry study C1 1412 is agreed. 
Final results will be submitted by June 2022. 
2.5.6.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the indication in the children population and on the basis of the limited safety data, the CHMP is 
of the opinion that the already existing entry in the EURD list for conestat alfa needs to be amended as 
follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a half-yearly cycle. The next data lock 
point will be 28/10/2020.  
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 19.2 is acceptable. The PRAC endorsed 
PRAC Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Variation C.1.6: Extension of indication in children from the age of 2 years and above 
This application includes an update on the indication to introduce the use of Ruconest in paediatric 
patients with acute angioedema attacks from the age of 2 years. As a consequence of this new indication, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated.  The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
Variation C.1.4: Final study results of adult and adolescent clinical data. 
An update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to amend frequencies of selected adverse drug reactions is 
introduced together with correction on figures and updated of information in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Variation C.1.11 
The delay in submission of the final study results of the registry study C1 1412 is agreed. Final results will 
be submitted by June 2022. 
Changes were also made to the Product Information to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD 
template version 10.1, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage 
conditions, Braille, etc…], which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet

has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ruconest. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has 
been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hereditary angioedema (HAE) has an estimated prevalence of (about) 1 out of 10,000. There is no known 
difference in prevalence across ethnic groups or gender. The European Register of Hereditary Angioedema 
reports a median age of symptom onset of 11 years and a median age of diagnosis at 26 years. In its 
most common form, hereditary angioedema presents marked swelling of the face, mouth and/or airway 
(leading to difficulty breathing) and intestinal oedema (causing abdominal pain). Swelling can occur in 
any part of the body. Episodes may occur spontaneously or in response to triggers such as trauma, 
medications, viral illness and stress. The frequency of acute angioedema attacks varies widely but on 
average attacks occur approximately 4-5 times per year. Patients have reported as few as 0 and as many 
as 50 attacks per year. C1 esterase inhibitor is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily. 
Its main function is the inhibition of the complement system to prevent spontaneous activation. 
Deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor is associated with hereditary angioedema. In the absence of C1 
inhibitor, excessive amounts of bradykinin are generated. Bradykinin promotes inflammation by 
increasing the leakage of fluid through the walls of blood vessels into body tissues. C1-inhibitor 
concentration in blood is about 0.25 g/L. The blood concentration of C1-inhibitor is low in 85% of the 
cases of hereditary angioedema and in the remaining 15% the protein circulates in normal amounts but is 
dysfunctional. Mutations that cause hereditary angioedema type I lead to reduced levels of C1 inhibitor in 
the blood while mutations that cause type II result in the production of a C1 inhibitor that functions 
abnormally. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Ruconest is approved for treatment of treatment of acute angioedema attacks in adult and adolescent 
patients  
Several other therapies are available in the European Union for the treatment of acute HAE attacks in 
patients from 2 years of age: 
Firazyr is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin and is a selective competitive 
antagonist at the bradykinin type 2 receptor. Firazyr is currently indicated for symptomatic treatment of 
acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, 
with C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency. 
Berinert is an extract of human plasma that contains the active substance: human C1-esterase inhibitor. 
Berinert is currently indicated for management of hereditary angioedema types I and II. 
Cinryze contains the active substance C1 inhibitor derived from human plasma. It is currently indicated 
for treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents and children (2 
years old and above) with hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 49/55 
  
  
Takhzyro (lanadelumab) is a monoclonal antibody therapy approved for the prevention of recurrent 
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients aged 12 years and older. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical data from study C1 1209 were submitted for the paediatric population. It was an open-label, 
Phase 2, single arm study to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 
recombinant human C1 inhibitor for the treatment of acute attacks in paediatric patients with hereditary 
angioedema, from 2 up to and including 13 years of age. 20 patients were treated for a total of 73 
attacks from 5 years of age. No dose modification was introduced compared to the posology 
recommended in the SmPC for adolescents and adults. However clarification on the timing of the second 
dose administration is introduced in section 4.2. Patients could be treated for a maximum of 10 attacks 
with a minimal interval between attacks of 24 hours. 
Updated safety data for the adolescent and adult population were provided in order to support the 
update of section 4.8 of the SmPC. Data from two open label extension (OLE) phases of randomized 
controlled studies presented at the initial marketing authorization procedure and from an additional study 
(RCT with OLE) have been submitted. Additional safety data were included from two studies investigating 
the use as prophylactic treatment of HAE patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The following favourable effects have been observed in study C1 1209 in the paediatric population: 
The median time to beginning of relief of symptoms with persistence based on Overall VAS decrease ≥ 20 
mm was 60 minutes (mean) post-dose across repeated attacks. This was the primary endpoint in study 
C1 1209. Time to beginning of relief of symptoms has also been included as exploratory endpoint 
measured based on Investigator score (IS) (60 minutes) and treatment effect questionnaire (TEQ) (60 – 
180 minutes at different attacks). 
The median time to minimal symptoms based on Overall VAS decrease ≥ 20 mm was approximately 120 
minutes post-dose across repeated attacks. This was defined as the primary endpoint in study C1 1209. 
Time to minimal symptoms has also been included as exploratory endpoint measured based on 
Investigator score (IS) (120-180 minutes) and treatment effect questionnaire (TEQ) (60 – 180 minutes at 
different attacks). 
The median time to complete resolution based on diary results varied across attacks, with median values 
ranging from 100.0 minutes post-dose at Attack 9 to 1167.5 minutes post-dose at Attack 1.  
A total of 3/20 (15.0%) patients for 3/73 (4.1%) of attacks in the ITT Analysis Set had therapeutic failure 
during the study: Two patients due beginning of relief of symptoms occurring later than 4 hours after 
treatment and one patient due a protocol deviation (disallowed concomitant medication).  
A total of 3/73 attacks were treated with a second dose of rhC1INH during the study. These attacks 
requiring a second dose were reported for 2/20 (10%) patients.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No placebo control arm was implemented in the study. 
The primary and secondary endpoints (time to beginning of relief of symptoms and time to minimal 
symptoms) have been measured with the overall visual analog scale (VAS) and additionally as 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report  
EMA/193472/2020 
Page 50/55 
  
  
exploratory endpoints with two different scores covering different aspects of treatment and possible 
benefit. Although the different perspectives are endorsed in general, all three scores are based on the 
patients’ subjective perception and the results differ between 60 and 180 minutes depending on the 
score. However, the overall VAS score has also been applied in the adult population with similar results to 
the paediatric population. 
The time to complete resolution was based on patient diaries and the results are highly variable, ranging 
from 33 to over 2000. Nevertheless, the data appear consistent with the variable disease manifestations 
(location, severity) and with the results observed in the adult and adolescent patients. 
Uncertainties as to whether the efficacy will wane on long term repeated administration in subjects who 
develop antibodies against rhC1INH data is addressed by an ongoing registry as described in the RMP.   
The ongoing registry study has been updated to gather data on this population in the post marketing. 
Extrapolation of the efficacy data to the younger patients of 2 to 4 years of age is considered acceptable 
based on the mechanism of action and existing knowledge in the literature, the provided PK analysis 
including a population PK model and the provided clinical data in older children. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The following unfavourable effects have been observed in study C1 1209 in the paediatric population: 
Three patients experienced nine serious adverse events (SAEs). The most common SAEs were grouped as 
SOC infections and infestations including bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, and viral infection.  
Eleven patients (55.0%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) after 
treatment with rhC1INH. There was no evidence of an increase in the TEAE frequency across attacks. Two 
patients (10.0%) reported TEAEs of severe intensity after study treatment (abdominal pain and 
vomiting). Two patients (10.0%) reported three events of abnormal lymphocyte morphology, which were 
considered possibly related to study treatment. No other events were reported as possibly treatment 
related. The most common TEAEs were infections and infestations (7/20 patients [35.0%]), 
gastrointestinal disorders (4/20 patients [20.0%]), and investigations (3/20 patients [15.0%]). 
The immunogenicity results of children between 5 and 14 years of age were consistent with the data 
observed in previous studies in adults and adolescents. Only sporadic, transient immune responses to 
rhC1INH and HRI were observed, but with no associated clinical findings. Hypersensitivity to host related 
impurities (HRI) is already an identified risk for Ruconest and included in the SmPC in section 4.4.  
In the additional studies performed in the adult and adolescent population the presented results for 
adverse events, laboratory findings as well as the immunogenicity results were consistent with the safety 
profile presented at the initial marketing authorization.  
One patient died in study C1 1207 (for prophylactic treatment) due to laryngeal oedema, which was 
considered not related to study drug. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety database for the paediatric population is limited with 20 patients treated for 73 
attacks. No safety data in children 2 to 4 years of age are available,  
Although no concerns due to antibody formation were evident, no data is available for long term repeated 
administration. However, this is addressed by the ongoing registry C1 1201 as described in the RMP 
which will collect further data post marketing.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary and secondary endpoints (time to beginning of relief of symptoms and time to minimal 
symptoms) are adequate to reflect a clinically relevant benefit for the patient suffering an attack. The 
exploratory endpoint time to complete resolution is also considered relevant in this context. Both 
exploratory endpoints – treatment failure and second dose – are adequately chosen to reflect other 
important aspects of the treatment related to HAE attacks. 
Although the efficacy and safety data presented for the paediatric population are limited with 20 patients 
aged 5 to 14 years old treated for 73 attacks, since HAE is an orphan disease, they are considered 
sufficient to support authorisation. The efficacy and safety results submitted in the children population 
have been consistent with the results in the adult and adolescent populations. 
No data are available in patients 2 to 4 years of age. The MAH tried to included patients in this age group 
but the availability of patients is limited in this orphan setting. In addition, other approved products for 
the treatment of HAE attacks in patients from 2 years of age are available and complying with all 
requirements in clinical trials might be an additional burden for the parents/caregivers.

In order to support the extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from older children to younger children 
aged 2 to 4 years where no clinical data are available the pharmacokinetic parameters of Ruconest in 
children were analysed and a population PK analysis presented. The results of the PK analysis as well as 
the predictions of the model are consistent with the results in adults and adolescents. The presented 
population PK model. predicted overall similar concentrations of Ruconest for adults, adolescents and 
children after administration of the recommended dose of 50 U/kg. Although a slight decrease in children 
< 5 years of age was predicted, this would still translate into 90% of children reaching maximum 
concentration of 0.7 U/mL. In case of an insufficient clinical response, an additional dose could be 
administered as recommended in the SmPC. 
The uncertainties discussed for the favourable effects concerning the size of the safety database and the 
minimal age of paediatric HAE patients also apply to the unfavourable effects.  
The reported adverse events are manageable and consistent with the safety profile established for the 
adult and adolescent populations. Further, no new safety concerns have been identified with the safety 
data provided in children from the age of 5 years.  
Remaining uncertainties concerning efficacy and safety due to antibody development with long term 
repeated treatment are addressed by an ongoing registry as described in the RMP. Due to the absence of 
clinical safety data in the 2 to 4 years of age population, it is important to closely monitor symptoms of 
hypersensitivity during and after administration of Ruconest. This is requested in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
for all patients. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
No direct evaluation of the treatment benefit in children 5-14 years of age can be performed since the 
presented study was performed as an open label single arm study. Nevertheless, the obtained results are 
consistent with the results observed in adult and adolescent populations. Given the mode of action of 
Ruconest as enzyme replacement and assuming similar concentrations are achieved, it is acceptable to 
consider that efficacy data derived from children (≥5 years), adolescents and adult patients could be 
extrapolated to younger children from the age of 2 years. 
Taking into account available data on efficacy and safety in patients 5 years and above, the presented 
popPK data, the mode of action, appropriate modifications to the SmPC and the proposed measures for 
gathering post marketing data, it is considered acceptable to amend the indication to include children 
from 2 years of age. Clarification is introduced in section 4.2 with regards to the timing of administration 
of a second dose if needed, this is supported by the PK data in children and in adult/adolescents. 
The safety profile in the paediatric population is manageable and overall consistent with the safety profile 
established for the adult and adolescent populations. 
Remaining uncertainties concerning efficacy and safety due to antibody development with long term 
repeated treatment are addressed by the ongoing registry study C1 1412 as described in the RMP. 
Monitoring of potential hypersensitivity reactions for all patients during and after the treatment is 
recommended in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Several studies providing additional safety data for the adolescent and adult population consistent were 
also submitted in this grouped variation supporting the requested update of section 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Additionally, the submission of the final study results of the ongoing registry study C1 1412 has been 
delayed up to June 2022.

Extension of indication to include the population of children from 2 years of age for the treatment of acute 
angioedema attacks with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. This 
indication is based on results from Study C1 1209 in the children population.  
Final efficacy and safety results from the Open Label Extension phases of Studies C1 1304, C1 1205, C1 
1310 for treatment of HAE attacks and studies  C1 1207 and C1 3201, investigating prophylactic 
treatment of HAE patients are also submitted to support update of sections 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the submission of the final report for Registry Study C1 1412 included in the RMP is 
extended to 30 June 2022. The RMP has also been aligned to RMP template version 2.0.1. 
Additionally, the product information has been updated to align with the most recent QRD template, 
version 10.1. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I, II, IIIA and IIIB 
and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Group of variations including an extension of indication assessment report

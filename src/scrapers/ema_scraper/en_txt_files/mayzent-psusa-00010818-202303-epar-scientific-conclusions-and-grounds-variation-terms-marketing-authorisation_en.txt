Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for siponimod, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of new data available on Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) from clinical 
trial(s), the PRAC considers that the frequency of PML in section 4.8 of the SmPC should be updated 
accordingly to the frequency in clinical trials. Therefore, the frequency should be “rare” instead of the 
current frequency “unknown”. 
In view of available data on bradyarrhythmic events risk(s) (specially the cases with atrioventricular 
block) from clinical trial(s) and the supportive cases from spontaneous reports, the PRAC concluded 
that the product information of products containing siponimod should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for siponimod the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing siponimod is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The

open label, 2 arm study aiming to demonstrate the 
superiority of NexoBrid treatment over SOC 
treatment in paediatric patients (aged 0 to 18 years) 
with deep partial thickness (DPT) and full thickness 
(FT) thermal burns of 1% to 30% of total body

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 
4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The 
Annex II and Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to remove 
the black triangle from the SmPC and the package 
leaflet, combine the SmPCs and introduce minor 
editorial corrections to the product information.

MW2010-03-02 (DETECT) category 1 study; a 
multicentre, multinational, randomized, controlled,

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
23/06/2022 
12/08/2022 
SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
NexoBrid in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Based on interim results from study MW2010-03-02 
6.6 of the SmPC based on literature references and 
on interim results from study MW2010-03-02 
(DETECT) listed as an obligation in the Annex II; this 
is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, 
controlled, assessor blinded, three-arm study 
performed in subjects with thermal burns, to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of NexoBrid 
compared to Gel Vehicle and compared to Standard 
of Care. The submitted Clinical Study Report includes 
data of Acute Phase and 12 months Follow Up Period 
including sub-studies on PK parameters, 
immunogenicity and cardiac ECG testing. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to revise the due date 
of the final study report for study MW2010-03-02 as 
agreed in procedure EMEA/H/C/002246/IB/0054. 
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest 
QRD template version 10.2. The Package Leaflet was 
updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
(DETECT) and on literature references, SmPC sections 4.2, 
4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.2 and 6.6 were updated. The package 
leaflet was updated accordingly.  The MAH initially 
proposed to extend the treatable wound area from 1 x 15% 
TBSA to 2 x 15% TBSA i.e. doubling the wound area for 
treatment to 30% TBSA in two treatment sessions. 
However, this was not agreed by CHMP as the safety 
database is currently considered insufficient and the 
submitted additional PK data are considered of minor 
relevance to support the extension of the treatable wound 
area from 1 x 15% TBSA to 2 x 15% TBSA. Thus, as stated 
in SmPC section 4.2, NexoBrid should not be applied to 
more than 15%.

Product Characteristics.

The results from study MW2013-06-01 has achieved its 
MW2013-06-01, listed as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. This is an international, observational 
retrospective, data-collection study assessing 
efficacy of applied risk-minimisation measures in 
burn patients treated with NexoBrid. In addition, the 
primary goal and thus, the effectiveness of the 
implemented risk minimisation measures (RMMs) is 
considered shown. Even though only limited conclusions 
with respect to the extrapolation of the study results to 
non-participating EU countries are possible, the study

are expected to yield important new safety data which 
could impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product.

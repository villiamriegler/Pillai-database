2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance in Eylea is aflibercept (also referred to as VEGF Trap or VTE), a recombinant fusion 
protein consisting of ligand binding regions within the extracellular domains of the human vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin 
IgG1. More specifically, aflibercept comprises immunoglobulin domain 2 from VEGFR1 fused to Ig domain 
3 from VEGFR2, which in turn is fused to the constant region of a human IgG1.  
VTE binds multiple isoforms of VEGF-A and placental growth factor-2 which are members of the VEGF 
family of angiogenic factors that act as potent mitogenic, chemotactic, and vascular permeability factors 
for endothelial cells, producing pathological neovascularization, excessive vascular permeability, and 
vascular inflammation. 
Eylea has been approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area through the centralised 
procedure by Commission Decision on 22 November 2012. The initial indication granted was for the 
treatment of adult patients with neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The 
indication was later extended by Commission Decision on 26 August 2013, 6 August 2014 and 24 
February 2015 to include treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to macular oedema

secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), and 
secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), respectively.  
Eylea is a solution for injection available in vials or pre-filled syringes. The recommended dose is 2 mg 
aflibercept equivalent to 50 microlitrers given intravitreally (IVT). 
Eylea is administered no more frequent than on a monthly basis. For AMD and DME, three and five initial 
consecutive doses are recommended, respectively. For RVO, initially, three or more consecutive monthly 
doses may be needed. 
Present application 
With  this  application,  the  MAH  proposed  to  extend  the  indication  for  adults  to  treatment  visual 
impairment  due  to  myopic  choroidal  neovascularisation  (myopic  CNV  or  mCNV),  i.e.  CNV  secondary  to 
pathologic myopia (PM). In this new indication, it is proposed to initiate treatment with a single injection 
and  then,  additional  injections  are  given  as  needed  only  when  there  are  signs  of  disease  activity.  The 
application is supported by the results of a single Phase III randomized controlled trial, MYRROR, in East-
Asian  mCNV  patients,  as  well  as  an  evaluation  of  the  ethnical  insensitivity  of  VTE  in  Asians  and 
Caucasians. 
Problem statement 
PM or high myopia, defined as refractive error ≥ -6 diopters (D), is a leading cause of blindness as it is 
associated  with  myopic  retinopathy  and  other  complications.  It  is  the  most  severe  form  of  myopia  that 
affects 2% of all myopic eyes. Both environmental factors and genetic factors are known to contribute to 
myopia development.  
CNV is one of the most common vision-threatening complications of pathologic myopia, a leading cause of 
blindness. 
CNV is one of the most common vision-threatening complications of PM. In contrast to CNV secondary to 
neovascular  AMD,  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  visual  impairment  due  to  mCNV  may  be  even  more 
devastating  as  it  typically  affects  young  individuals  in  the  working  age  group  (Cohen  et  al.,  1996),  and 
occurs about one decade earlier than other common blinding eye diseases. 
Among Caucasians in Australia and the United States, approximately 20% of the population has (simple) 
myopia while in many Asian countries the incidence exceeds 20%. The incidence of high myopia among 
Asians has been reported to be around 2.3 times greater than among Caucasians. The prevalence of CNV 
in  individuals  with  PM  was  reported  to  be  5.2%-11.3%  with  a  prevalence  of  visual  impairment  due  to 
pathologic  myopia  ranging  from  0.1%-0.5%  in  European  studies  and  from  0.2%-1.4%  in  Asian  studies. 
Most  eyes  progress  to  20/200  or  worse  within  5  to  10  years  after  onset.  During  the  natural  course  of 
mCNV,  patients  progressively  lose  VA  at  a  rate  of  approximately  10  to  15  letters  (2  to  3  lines)  over  2 
years. 
The  increased  prevalence  of  pathological  myopia  among  Asian  adults  compared  to  American  and 
European  adults  is  attributed  to  a  number  of  factors  including  urbanization,  intensive  studying,  high 
educational attainment, lack of outdoor activities, and longer axial length in young individuals. In Japan, 
pathological  myopia  is  the  leading  cause  of  unilateral  and  bilateral  blindness  (Iwase  et  al.,  2010). 
According to some literature reports (Williams KM et al., Ophthalmology 2015) the prevalence of myopia 
is also increasing in Europe. 
Myopia can be classified as simple or pathologic (synonyms: progressive, degenerative). Eyes with simple 
myopia  are  elongated  proportional  to  the  refractive  error  (usually  0.3  mm/diopter  [D]),  but  lack 
pathologic  fundus  changes,  even  if  the  refractive  error  is  high.  PM  encompasses  the  condition  of  the 
abnormal elongation of the axial length of the eyeball (> 26 mm) associated with high myopia refractive

errors,  usually  ≥  -  6.0  D,  and  have,  in  addition,  pathologic  tissue  alterations  such  as  retinal  pigment 
epithelial  thinning  and  defects,  lacquer  cracks  and  Bruch’s  membrane  ruptures,  CNV,  subretinal 
haemorrhage, and choroidal thinning and atrophy, which ultimately lead to central macular degeneration 
and macular scarring.  
Morphologically,  mCNV  appears  as  a  flat,  small,  grayish  subretinal  membrane  beneath  or  in  close 
proximity to the fovea. The mechanisms of CNV formation in pathologic myopia are still not fully clarified. 
Hypoxia in the outer retina due to choroidal stretching and thinning is considered part of the pathological 
pathway and has been suggested to stimulate VEGF secretion.  
The  visual  prognosis  of  mCNV  patients  is  generally  poor  without  treatment.  Following  an  early 
stabilization of vision, visual acuity gradually and progressively decrease over time primarily.  
The most common treatment of choice for non-subfoveal CNV lesions is laser photocoagulation. However, 
it  is  associated  with  permanent  loss  of  vision  within  the  treated  area,  as  well  as  formation  of  new 
abnormal  vasculature.  Photodynamic  therapy  (PDT)  with  verteporfin  (vPDT)  has  been  used  for  treating 
mCNV in the past decade in Europe, the United States, Hong Kong, Singapur,  Taiwan and  South Korea, 
but  not  Japan.  The  available  data  suggest  that  PDT  might  reduce  the  risk  of  visual  loss  compared  to 
placebo,  but  no  improvement  in  mean  visual  acuity  was  observed.  Therefore,  maintenance  of  VA  is,  at 
the very best, the expected benefit of treatment with vPDT.  
More  recently,  IVT  anti-VEGF  agents  have  been  used  to  treat  visual  impairment  in  patients  with  mCNV. 
Ranibizumab  was  approved  in the  EU  by  Commission  Decision  in  July  2013.  Efficacy  of  IVT  ranibizumab 
compared  to  vPDT  was  established  in  a  phase  III,  randomized,  double-masked,  multicenter,  active-
controlled  study.  Over  12  months,  individualized  ranibizumab  treatment  was  effective  in  improving  and 
sustaining visual acuity and was generally well tolerated in patients with mCNV. 
Rational for proposed change 
VTE,  like  ranibizumab,  acts  by  binding  and  inhibiting  VEGF.  Patients  with  active  mCNV  have  elevated 
levels of VEGF in the aqueous humor of the concerned eye(s). Similar to wet AMD, by inactivating VEGF, 
VTE  is  thought  to  inhibit  neovascular  growth  and  associated  exudation,  with  subsequent  suppression  of 
CNV growth. Based on previous experience with other anti-VEGF agents in mCNV patients, treatment with 
VTE is expected to have a direct and immediate clinical effect of visual improvement.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In line with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1), since aflibercept is a protein and unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment, Eylea is exempted from an environmental risk assessment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The objective of the clinical pharmacology program for VTE in patients with mCNV was to characterize the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and systemic exposure of VTE after IVT administration in patients with mCNV and 
to compare the PK and the systemic exposure with that observed in patients with neovascular AMD or 
CRVO. 
Sparse samples were collected in all patients enrolled in the clinical Phase III study MYRROR. Additionally, 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 8/72 
 
  
  
 
dense sampling has been performed in a limited sub-group of patients.  
Analytical Methods 
Free VTE and bound VTE plasma concentrations were measured using validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. The assay for bound VTE is calibrated using standards for the 
complex VEGF:VTE standards and the results are reported for bound VTE as weight per volume of the 
complex. Therefore, the concentration of the bound complex is to be adjusted by multiplying with a factor 
of 0.717 to account for the VEGF present in the complex (referred to as adjusted bound VTE). The lower 
limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for the free and adjusted bound assays is 0.0156 mg/L and 0.0315 mg/L, 
respectively. 
Sample collection, sample handling, and analytical methods were identical to previous PK analyses in 
other indications, allowing for comparability across programs. 
Results 
•  Dense sampling data 
Dense sampling was performed in a sub-set of 8 patients treated with VTE in the MYRROR study. Non-
compartmental analysis was only done for patients with concentrations >LLOQ and no more than 
2 subsequently missing concentrations. Samples were taken at Baseline (pre-dose) and 4 h, 8 h, 1 d, 2 d, 
3 d, 4 d, 7 d, 14 d and 28 d after the first dose. 
A plasma concentration-time profile for free VTE valid for non-compartmental analysis was observed in 
only one subject. In the other 7 subjects, none or maximal 2 plasma samples had free VTE 
concentrations >LLOQ. However, even these quantifiable concentrations were close to the analytical 
limits and were no more than about 4-fold higher than the LLOQ (with the exception of one subject where 
it was 7-fold higher). Cmax could only be calculated for one subject (27.3 μg/L) and was reached after 
94.4 hours. The mean concentration-time profile of free VTE over all 8 subjects of the PK sub-study 
showed concentrations >LLOQ in 1 or 2 subjects per time points from 4 hours to 7 days post-dose. Two 
weeks after the first administration of VEGF-Trap Eye all plasma concentration values for free VEGF-Trap 
were <LLOQ. 
Exploratory subgroup analyses with respect to age, sex, BMI, creatinine clearance, hepatic impairment, 
and geographical region was not conducted because nearly all free VEGF Trap plasma concentrations in 
the samples for the general PK assessment of trough concentrations were below LLOQ. 
The mean Cmax of adjusted bound VTE was around 130 μg/L as measured after a single IVT 
administration of VTE 2 mg. In studies in healthy volunteers with intravenous administrations of up to 
4 mg/kg submitted and assessed in a previous application for AMD, mean maximum adjusted bound 
concentrations of 2000 to 3000 μg/L were found, with bound concentrations showing only minor 
increases with doses above 2 mg/kg. It was, therefore, assumed that substantial binding of endogenous 
VEGF is attained at doses of 2 mg/kg and above. The concentrations of bound VTE as measured using 
dense sampling in MYRROR are, thus, approximately 4% to 7% of those measured in the studies with 
intravenous VTE. The value of 7% may be regarded as a rough estimate for the maximum endogenous 
VEGF that was bound under the study conditions. Taking this into account, the present data suggest that 
only a minor fraction of the available systemic endogenous VEGF is expected to be bound to VTE. 
•  Sparse sampling data 
Blood samples for the general PK assessment (sparse sampling schedule) of systemic trough 
concentrations of free and bound VTE were collected before dose administration at Weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 
36, and at any time at Week 48 from all (91) patients in MYRROR. 
IVT administration of VTE 2 mg resulted in pre-dose plasma concentrations (after repeated 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 9/72 
 
  
  
administrations) of free VTE that were below the LLOQ for the vast majority of subjects. Mean trough 
concentrations of free VTE were only measurable in a few patients, mainly at the Day 1, 1-4h post-dose 
time point. This result was expected because VTE is absorbed slowly from the eye into the systemic 
circulation, where it binds to endogenous VEGF. 
Mean trough concentrations of adjusted bound VTE were 104 μg/L at Week 4 and declined until Week 48 
to 39.3 μg/L. All individual patients (from the mandatory sparse sampling PK assessment of trough 
concentrations and the PK sub-study) had adjusted bound VTE plasma concentrations <331 μg/L at all 
time points. Exploratory sub-group analysis of adjusted bound VTE suggested higher systemic distribution 
of VTE in Japanese patients (63.1±83.1 µg/L) compared to non-Japanese patients (15.8±41.0 µg/L). 
Further investigation by the MAH in response to a CHMP request showed that the increase in Japanese 
patients at week 24 was not present at week 12. Considering the variability and scarcity of the data the 
finding at week 24 was considered to be likely an artefact. The sub-group analyses did not reveal any 
clinically relevant differences.  
Repeated administration of VTE 2 mg every 4 weeks did not result in any accumulation of the compound 
in plasma. Therefore, the PK results suggest no increased risk of systemic side effects with longer 
treatment duration. 
•  Comparison of data across studies: 
Analytical techniques and sampling schedule in mCNV (MYRROR Study), CRVO (GALILEO Study), and 
neovascular AMD (VGFT-OD-0702.PK and VIEW 2) were similar, thus eliciting a reliable inter-study 
comparison. 
While small numerical differences were observed between in the PK parameters, the data did not suggest 
a meaningful difference in systemic exposure following a 2 mg IVT administration of VTE in patients with 
mCNV compared with patients with neovascular AMD or CRVO. The arithmetic mean Cmax values for free 
VTE in mCNV, CRVO, and AMD patients were low, and were only approximately 1 to 3 times the LLOQ 
(15.6 μg/L) of the assay. Notable, as previously mentioned, the Cmax value for free VTE after single 
administration in mCNV was based on only one evaluable subject. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of VTE were discussed as part of the initial approved marketing application 
for treatment of subjects with wAMD. See also section 2.1. for a summary of the mode of action. 
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) information was collected in the MYRROR study from all subjects. A total of 4 
samples from 2 subjects (both in the VTE 2 mg group) had positive responses in the ADA assay. Both 
subjects exhibited positive assay results at Baseline. One of them had a Baseline titer level of 240, a 
Week 24 titer level of 480 and a Week 48 titer level of 120. Since the post-treatment titer levels did not 
increase more than 4-fold over Baseline levels, the assay results in this subject were attributed to pre-
treatment immunoreactivity. The other subject had a Baseline titer level of 30 (the assay minimal titer) 
and was negative at the Week 24 and 48 time points, suggesting the subject was negative for ADA. None 
of the samples demonstrated neutralizing activity.  
Mean systolic blood pressure and mean diastolic blood pressure varied only slightly during the course of 
the study compared to baseline values. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The analytical techniques used for PK sampling in the mCNV study were the same as those previously 
used and assessed for other indications.   
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 10/72 
 
  
  
Based on dense sampling in a small subgroup of 8 subjects in MYRROR with a single dose of 2 mg VTE, 
generally low free VTE plasma concentrations were observed. As expected, most of the VTE in the 
systemic circulation is bound to the endogenous VEGF. Additional data from sparse sampling showed no 
accumulation of free or adjusted bound VTE after repeated administration. Exploratory sub-group analysis 
of adjusted bound VTE suggested higher systemic distribution of bound VTE in Japanese patients 
compared to non-Japanese patients at Week 24. However, this finding was considered to be likely an 
artefact as no increase was observed at week 12 and in light of the small samples size and high 
variability of the data.  
Cross study comparison revealed no marked differences in systemic exposure between patients groups 
(mCNV, AMD and CRVO). However, some of the PK parameters were estimated from small patient 
numbers of patients, thus limiting the interpretability.  
ADA assays resulted only in few positive samples, which were not treatment-emergent, exhibited low 
titers, and did not demonstrated any neutralizing activity. There was also no effect on mean blood 
pressure associated with increased blood pressure after IVT administration in the Asian population tested 
in the MYRROR study.  
Generally, the CHMP was of the view that the effects of Eylea in non-Japanese patients should be 
evaluated based on clinical efficacy and safety data. Of note, the impact of the ethnic intrinsic factor on 
the PK profile of IVT VTE administration is summarised in section 2.4.   
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Taking into account all available data, neither the difference in study population demographics, nor 
difference in disease-related pathology resulted in any clinically meaningful difference in the systemic 
exposure to free or bound forms of VTE in the mCNV subjects as compared to wAMD or CRVO subjects 
previously studied. No signs of immunogenicity or blood pressure increases were observed. Overall, the 
CHMP was of the opinion that the data provided were sufficient to support the application for Eylea for an 
extension of the indication in the treatment of adults with visual impairment due to mCNV. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical development program of Eylea for the treatment of mCNV consisted of a single phase III 
study (MYRROR) conducted in 20 centers in Japan (15), Hong Kong (1), Singapore (1), South Korea (1) 
and Taiwan (2). The MYRROR Phase III trial aimed at investigating if VTE will improve visual acuity (VA) 
in subjects with choroidal neovascularization secondary to pathologic myopia and whether there will be 
other potential advantages, such as prevention of moderate vision loss, associated with the use of VTE.  
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dedicated dose response studies were carried out by the MAH. 
The rationale for the final dose selection of 2 mg IVT injections of VTE was based on the safety and 
efficacy results from the phase III clinical trials conducted for AMD and CRVO. No new data were 
generated specifically for mCNV. 
The dosing regimen in the MYRROR study was chosen based on expert advice as well as publicly available 
data from studies of other anti-VEGF agents, which suggested that single IVT administration of an anti-
VEGF drug was sufficient to cause CNV blockade (disappearance of leakage in fluorescein angiography) 
and visual improvement in the majority of tested patients with mCNV (Hayashi et al., Am J Opthalmol. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 11/72 
 
  
  
2009). Besides, no significant difference was seen in the improvement of visual acuity achieved with 
initial 3-monthly doses followed by additional dosing, and a single dose followed by additional dosing 
(Wakabayashi et al., Retina 2011). Thus, subjects in the MYRROR study were treated with a dose of 2 mg 
VTE administered by a single injection at study start (or at Week 24 for the control group, which had only 
sham treatment through week 20) and followed by additional doses in case of persisting or recurring 
disease, based on pre-defined re-treatment criteria (see Section 2.4.2. for details). 
At the time of starting the MYRROR study, no anti-VEGF therapy had been approved in this indication 
anywhere in the world. However, some peer-reviewed publications of previous non-controlled studies 
suggested that anti-VEGF may become the new standard therapy in the treatment of CNV secondary to 
pathologic myopia. However, confirmation of this assumption by appropriate studies was still missing. In 
some Asian countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea) vPDT was approved in the 
treatment of CNV secondary to pathologic myopia but not in Japan, where most of the study sites for 
MYRROR were planned. Therefore,  Sham was selected as control in MYRROR. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
MYRROR: Phase-3, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-masked, Sham-controlled Study of the 
Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Intravitreal VEGF Trap-Eye in Subjects with Choroidal 
Neovascularization Secondary to Pathologic Myopia 
Methods 
Study participants 
Subjects eligible for this study were adult males and females with active mCNV as defined by leakage on 
fluorescein angiography (FA), and with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 73 to 35 letters (ETDRS 
equivalent of 20/40 to 20/200). A Central Reading Centre confirmed the eligibility of a subject. Based on 
the medical judgment of the investigator, the subject’s decrease in vision was primarily the result of 
current active mCNV.  
Only one eye was designated as the study eye. However, safety of the fellow eye was monitored also, 
and all systemic adverse events (AEs) were collected. For subjects who met eligibility criteria in both 
eyes, the eye with the worst VA was selected as the study eye. If both eyes had equal VA, the eye with 
the clearest lens and ocular media and least amount of subfoveal scarring or chorioretinal atrophy was 
selected. If there was no objective basis for selecting the study eye, factors such as ocular dominance, 
other ocular pathology, and subject preference was considered in making the selection. 
The main inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarised below. 
Main inclusion criteria: 
1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age. 
2. Myopia ≥-6 diopter or axial length ≥ 26.5 mm.

Treatments 
Eligible subjects were enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, 
active or Sham.  
VTE: Patients randomized to the VTE group received an IVT injection of 2 mg VTE at Visit 2 (Day 1). 
Additional active injections were allowed in subjects who, upon assessment, met one or more of the study 
re-treatment criteria, up to and including Week 44.  
Sham+VTE: Patients randomized to the control group (Sham) were to receive Sham injections every 
4 weeks from Visit 2 (Day 1) to Visit 7 (Week 20). Patients underwent assessment for re-treatment 
criteria (in order to maintain masking) but did not receive VTE injections regardless of the outcome of this 
assessment. At Week 24, subjects were assessed against the study re-treatment criteria (in order to 
maintain masking). They received a mandatory active injection with VTE 2 mg regardless of the outcome 
of the re-treatment assessment. They then received VTE 2 mg injections in the study eye, if protocol re-
treatment criteria were fulfilled until Week 44. 
Figure 1 – Study design 
Subjects who received therapy with another investigational agent to treat mCNV or any other condition 
were excluded from the study. If the fellow eye had mCNV, this eye was allowed to receive any approved 
treatment (i.e., not investigational treatment) other than the study drug, other anti-VEGF therapies, or 
steroids. The fellow eye was not considered an additional study eye. 
Retreatment were at maximum every 4 weeks. At all visits when the re-treatment criteria were not met, 
the subject received a Sham injection in order to maintain masking. 
Re-treatment criteria: 
Retreatment criteria aimed at determining recurrence or persistence of mCNV. 
At least one of the following criteria was to be met for re-treatment with VTE: 
•  Reduction in VA by ≥5 letters from the previous ETDRS examination. 
•  CRT increases by more than 50 ìm from the time of the previous examination. 
•  New or persistent cystic retinal changes, subretinal fluid, or pigment epithelial detachment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 14/72 
 
  
  
 
 
•  New or persistent CNV or bleeding. 
•  As deemed necessary by the investigator based on his/her clinical impression and/or diagnostics 
performed in the context of standard medical care. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of intravitreal (IVT) administration of VTE in comparison to 
Sham treatment on the mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 24 in patients with CNV secondary 
to pathologic myopia (myopic CNV). 
Secondary objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the safety and tolerability of IVT administration of VTE in subjects with mCNV. 
To assess the efficacy of IVT administration of VTE on vision related quality of life (QoL) as 
assessed using the National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). 
To assess changes in leakage at the CNV site as seen on FA. 
To describe the systemic exposure to study drug by PK investigations. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Variable: Mean change from Baseline in BCVA as measured by ETDRS at Week 24. 
Secondary Efficacy Variable: Proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters in BCVA at Weeks 24. 
Additional Efficacy Variables: 
•  Mean change from baseline in BCVA as measured by ETDRS at each visit and at Week 48. 
•  Vision gains and losses ≥ 5, 10, or 15 letters at each visit and at Week 24 and 48. 
•  Change in central retinal thickness (CRT) (µm) from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48. 
•  Change in CNV lesion size (DA) from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48. 
•  Change in area of leakage (DA) from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48. 
•  Change in total NEI-VFQ-25 score from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48. 
•  Change in EQ-5D score from baseline at Weeks 24 and 48. 
• 
Proportion of subjects who withdrew from study drug by Week 24 and Week 48. 
•  Ad  hoc  analysis  of  exposure:  Number  of  injections  administered  in  total  and  per  quarter  of 
treatment period (i.e., within Weeks 0 to 8, Weeks 12 to 20, Weeks 24 to 32, and Weeks 36 to 
44). 
The assessment of BCVA was performed by site personnel who have been trained and certified for 
assessment using the ETDRS chart by a qualified training centre. OCT images were read locally by site 
personnel who have been trained and certified by the Central Reading Centre. The results of FA and 
fundus photography (FP) were evaluated centrally by the Central Reading Centre. 
Sample size 
One hundred-twenty subjects (90 active and 30 Sham) were planned to be randomized. The assumptions 
made in the calculation of the sample size were based on the following: 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 15/72 
 
  
  
 
• 
• 
The difference between treatment groups in the changes in BCVA from Baseline to Week 24 will 
be 10 letters. 
The changes in BCVA from Baseline will be normally distributed with a common standard 
deviation of 14 letters. 
•  A t-test with a one-sided alpha level of 0.025 will be used to demonstrate statistical significance. 
Based on these assumptions, 112 evaluable subjects in total were calculated to provide 90% power to 
show statistical significance for the primary endpoint. To be conservative, i.e. estimating that 5% of the 
randomized subjects will not be eligible for the primary analysis, 120 subjects were to be randomized 
from all participating study sites. 
Randomisation 
Subjects eligible for the study were randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to either the VTE or control (Sham-
injection) group. Randomization was stratified by country. Assignment into a treatment group was done 
using an Interactive Voice Response System or an Interactive Web Response System. 
Blinding (masking) 
All study-site personnel (except for those performing designated unmasked roles) remained masked to 
treatment assignment of all subjects in order to ensure an unbiased assessment of VA, safety, and 
ancillary study measures. An independent monitor responsible for pharmacy site visits was unmasked to 
study treatment. Patients, all other study personnel, and Steering Committee members remained masked 
to treatment assignment. 
At all visits patients were assessed for re-treatment criteria and received either active of Sham injections 
in order to maintain masking. In the active arm, even when the re-treatment criteria were not met, the 
subject received a Sham injection; in the Sham arm, even when the re-treatment criteria were met, the 
subject received a Sham injection until 24 Week. 
The masked principal investigator was responsible to assess AEs, perform the masked assessment of 
efficacy, and assess re-treatment criteria at Visits 3 through 13. Other masked study site personnel 
performed the masked assessments of VA, FA and fundus photography, and OCT, as well as other non-
ophthalmic assessments. 
Statistical methods 
Populations for analysis 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized subjects who received any study drug and have a 
Baseline and at least one post-baseline BCVA assessment. The FAS will be analysed as randomized. 
The per protocol set (PPS) included all subjects in the FAS who attended at least two scheduled visits 
during the first 24 weeks of the study, with the exception of those subjects who are excluded because of 
major protocol violations, where the violation is one that may affect the interpretation of study results 
(e.g., missing two consecutive injections). The PPS also included subjects who were deemed to be 
treatment failures at any time during the first 24 weeks of the study. The PPS will be analysed as treated. 
The safety analysis set (SAF) included all subjects who received any study drug. The safety analysis set 
was analysed as treated. 
Statistical methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 16/72 
 
  
  
The primary efficacy analysis compared the change in BCVA from Baseline to Week 24 between treatment 
groups by calculating a two-sided 95%-confidence interval (CI) of the between-group treatment 
difference using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, including "treatment group" and "country" as 
fixed effects and "baseline BCVA" as covariate. If the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 0, then 
superiority of VTE to Sham injection was established. This superiority testing was conducted with the FAS.  
Additional analysis of the primary endpoint was also performed on the PPS to support the FAS. 
A last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for the primary analysis and an observed case 
analysis (OC) for both the FAS and the PPS as sensitivity analysis were chosen at first. However, during 
the actual study conduct, several dropouts were recorded. Therefore, to further explore the robustness of 
the pre-specified primary analysis and assess the impact of missing data on the efficacy evaluation more 
comprehensively, further sensitivity analyses were added before database lock and unmasking of the 
study data including multiple imputation analysis of missing values and a mixed model for repeated 
measurements. Additional sensitivity analysis of the confirmatory secondary efficacy variable were also 
introduced. This analysis used worst case imputation, i.e., subjects prematurely discontinuing treatment 
before Week 24 were considered as failures for this analysis. 
During the period from baseline to W24, all other visual and anatomic criteria were analysed as 
exploratory including CRT. All efficacy and safety analyses performed at Week 48 were similar to the 
analyses performed at Week 24 and all considered exploratory. The difference between treatment groups 
and a corresponding two-sided 95% CI was estimated for a descriptive purpose. 
The continuous variables, including the mean change from baseline to Week 48 in BCVA, CRT, CNV lesion 
size, EQ-5D score, NEI VFQ-25 total score and leakage measured by FA, were assessed using an ANCOVA 
model, including treatment groups and country (country designations) as fixed effects and Baseline 
measurement as a covariate.  
The categorical variables, including the proportion of subjects who gained/lost ≥ 5, 10, or 15 letters and 
who were withdrawn by Week 48, were analyzed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method, 
weight-adjusted for country (country designations), from which the difference in proportions of subjects 
between treatment groups and a corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval were estimated. 
Subgroups 
All subgroup analyses, except the by-country analysis were for descriptive purposes only. These variables 
are summarized below: 
•  Country (Japan, Other): statistical tests repeated for Japanese subjects  
•  Sex (Male, Female) 
•  Age group (<45, 45-<55, 55-<65, 65-<75, ≥75) 
•  Baseline BCVA > 20/200 (letters read ≥ 35) and BCVA ≤ 20/200 (letters read ≤ 34) 
•  Duration of disease (< 2 months, ≥ 2 months) 
•  Renal impairment, classified by creatinine clearance (CrCl) at baseline (Normal: CrCl > 80 
mL/min, Mild: 50 < CrCl ≤ 80 mL/min, Moderate: 30 < CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min, o Severe: CrCl ≤ 30 
mL/min or requiring dialysis) 
•  Hepatic impairment (Yes, No) 
In the VEGF Trap-Eye group, the descriptive summary of efficacy variables was also calculated by number 
of active injections.

Table 2 - Disposition of Subjects at 24 and 48 weeks in MYRROR Study and Reasons for 
Premature Discontinuation (All patients All randomized subjects) 
During the 24 weeks of the study, in the FAS, the mean of compliance value was 97.41% and 88.71%, in 
the VTE 2 mg group and the Sham group, respectively. A total of 95.6% of patients in VTE 2 mg group 
and 83.9% in the Sham group received 80% to 100% of all scheduled treatments. 
Recruitment 
The MYRROR study was conducted in approximately 20 study sites, in Japan (15), in South Korea (1), in 
Singapore (1), in Taiwan (2), in Hong Kong (1). The first subject's first informed consent was on 
17 December 2010 and last subject's last visit was on 15 August 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol of MYRROR Study is dated 16 September 2010. There were 2 global amendments 
(dated 8 Mar 2011 and 30 Nov 2011) and 1 local in Japan (dated 23 May 2012). 
Amendment no 1 clarified the inclusion criteria.  
• 
Loss of vision in the study eye: The original protocol stated that the onset of symptoms of mCNV 
(i.e. vision loss in the study eye) must not have occurred earlier than 6 months prior to the 
signing of the informed consent form (i.e., Screening/Visit 1). This stipulation was removed and 
replaced with the instructions that the investigator, based on his/her medical judgment, would 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 19/72 
 
  
  
 
 
determine if the loss of vision in the study eye was primarily the result of the current active 
mCNV. 
The specifics of the subject’s myopia (i.e., ≥-6 Diopter with axial length ≥ 26.5 mm) was 
modified to state that eligible subjects would have myopia ≥ -6D OR axial length ≥ 26.5 mm. 
Juxtafoveal lesions was defined as those within 1 to 199 ìm of the center of the fovea. The 
criterion was further clarified to state that if exact location of the lesion could not be determined 
by the study site, the Central Reading Center would be responsible to classify the lesion as 
subfoveal or juxtafoveal. 
The ECG should be performed before (after was removed and replaced) study drug injection or PK 
sample collection. 
• 
• 
• 
It was clarified that the reference to China included both China mainland and Hong Kong (see below). 
Amendment no 2 was made to allow partial collection of pharmacokinetic samples from subjects who 
were unable to perform all visits required for the PK sub-study. Furthermore, the total sample size was 
reduced because no Clinical Trial Permit to conduct the study in the People’s Republic of China could be 
obtained. 
Amendment no 3 allowed part of the subjects in Japan to begin a participation in the PK sub-study at Visit 
8/Week 24. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and Baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 3 and Table 4.  
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 20/72 
 
  
  
Table 3 – Demographic Characteristics of All Study Subjects in MYRROR (FAS) 
The majority of subjects were female (n=92; 76.0%), all were Asian (n=121; 100%) with about 74% 
Japanese. The total population ranged in age from 27 to 83 years (mean 58.2 +/-13.3 years). 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 21/72 
 
  
  
 
Table 4 - Baseline Disease Characteristics of the Study Eye in MYRROR (FAS) 
In both groups, the majority of subjects had a disease duration of < 2 months (the mean duration of 
disease was about 5 months). Most subjects had a Baseline BCVA of ≥20/200 (≥35 letters); the mean 
baseline BCVA letter score was approximately 56.5 letters. The mean baseline CRT was about 
350 microns.  
All but one subject in the Sham group had a classic CNV type of lesion diagnosed at screening. The 
location of CNV was central (subfoveal) in the majority of subjects of the two groups. Some numerical 
differences in the mean CNV lesion size were noted (0.4086 ± 0.5028 DA in the VTE 2 mg group versus 
0.3334 ± 0.3413 DA in the Sham+VTE 2 mg group, whereas medians were similar with 0.2535 DA and 
0.2450 DA, respectively). 
Baseline axial length was similar with 28.79 mm (SD 1.52) in the VTE 2 mg group and 28.61 mm (SD 
1.70) in the Sham group. The majority of subjects in both treatment groups (>97% in each group) had a 
leakage present. 
Baseline vital signs in MYRROR Study were balanced across groups (SAF). 
The most common ocular medical and surgical history findings in the study eye were choroidal 
neovascularization (all subjects, 100.0%), pathologic myopia (120 subjects, 98.4%), cataract 
(24 subjects, 19.7%), and cataract operation (24 subjects, 19.7%).

Table 5 - Most common (at least 2 subjects in either group) ocular medical history findings in 
the study eye by MedDRA PT (SAF) 
The most frequent non-ocular medical history findings were in the MedDRA SOCs Vascular Disorders with 
the PT hypertension in 27.9% overall (31.9% in the VTE 2 mg group and 16.1% in the Sham group). 
There was a somewhat higher proportion of subjects in the VTE 2 mg group than in the Sham group with 
medical/surgical history findings reported for the SOCs Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders (20.9% vs. 
9.7%), Psychiatric Disorders (13.2% vs. 6.5%), Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (9.9% 
vs. 3.2%), Immune System Disorders (8.8% vs. 3.2%), and Gastrointestinal Disorders (13.2% vs. 
6.5%). Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) were more frequent in the 
Sham group with 9.7% vs. 4.4% in the VTE 2 mg group. Differences ≥ 5% in the occurrence of effects 
(PTs) which were more frequent in the VTE 2 mg group included insomnia (9.9% vs. none in the Sham 
group), allergic rhinitis with 5.5% and no subject in the Sham group, hyperlipidemia (8.8% in the VTE 2 
mg group, 3.2% in the Sham group). 
The  most  commonly  used  concomitant  medications  were  in  the  classes  ‘Ophthalmologicals’  (91  [100%] 
VTE  group,  30  [96.8%]  Sham  group)  and  ‘Cardiovascular  system’  (49  [53.8%]  VTE  2  mg;  12  [38.7%] 
Sham+VTE  2  mg  with  calcium  channel  blockers  [24.6%  overall],  serum  lipid  reducing  agents  [21.3% 
overall], and agents acting on the renin angiotensin system [18.0% overall]). 
Numbers analysed 
All of the 122 randomized subjects (91 in the VTE 2 mg group and 31 in the Sham group) received at 
least one study treatment (i.e., VTE or Sham injection).

Table 6 – Overview of analyses sets (all randomised patients) 
a: The analysis set for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) testing consisted of all 122 randomized subjects for whom serum 
samples were taken pre-dose at Baseline and at Week 48. 
b: All 25 subjects in the sham group who switched to active treatment from Week 24 onwards. 
c: These 6 subjects were not analyzed for PK, since they never received active VTE (discontinued treatment before 
Week 24). 
A total of 7 (5.7%) subjects had major protocol deviations [5 (5.5%) in the VTE 2 mg group and 2 
(6.5%) in the Sham group]. The most common major protocol deviation was inclusion/exclusion criterion 
not met, which occurred with 4 subjects in total (3 subjects in the VTE 2 mg group and one subject in the 
Sham+VTE 2 mg group). 
A total of 22 subjects (15 subjects in the VTE 2 mg group and 7 subjects in the Sham+VTE 2 mg group) 
were involved in any events of unmasking. In the Sham+VTE 2 mg group, one subject required 
premature emergency unmasking because of a non-ocular, non-serious AE ‘impetigo contagiosa’.

Table 7 - Subjects by number of active injections and study period through Week 48 (FAS) 
Regarding the number of active injections for the VTE group, in the first part of the study, from Baseline 
to Week 20, 73.3% of patients in the VTE group needed ≤ 3 active injections. This was reflected by the 
median number of active injections (3 injections) and the mean number of active injections (2.9 
injections) for the overall VTE population. In the second period of the study, the mean number of active 
injections decreased to less than 1.5 injections in the VTE group (median=1 injection). The mean number 
of active injections applied to the Sham+VTE group in the second period of the study was slightly higher 
than the number applied to the VTE group from Baseline to Week 24 (3.9 vs 3) with a median of 
3 injections. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 25/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The mean interval between injections in subjects who had received at least 2 injections was 37.1 days in 
the Sham+VTE 2 mg group versus 46.5 days in the VTE 2 mg group whereas the mean interval between 
first and second injection was 47.2 days in the Sham+VTE 2 mg group versus 54.1 days in the VTE 2 mg 
group. 
Data were also analyzed by quarters of the treatment length (ie, Baseline to Week 8, Weeks 12 to 20, 
Weeks 24 to 32, and Weeks 36 to 44). According to this analysis, most of the injections were 
administered in the first quarter of the study, with less frequent re-injections over the subsequent 
3 quarters. 
The maximum number of active injections in the VTE 2 mg group was 12 through the 48 weeks period of 
treatment and 6 in the Sham+VTE group through the same period. Six subjects in the VTE group (6.7%) 
received 12 injections, while 13 subjects (14.4%) were treated with only 1 injection during the entire 
study period (FAS). In the Sham+VTE 2 mg group, 6 subjects (19.4%%) were not exposed as they had 
discontinued study treatment before Week 24, 2 subjects (6.5%) had received 1 injection, and 9 subjects 
(29.0%) had received the maximum number of 6 active injections (FAS). 
The reasons for retreatment were mainly ‘new or persistent CNV or bleeding’, and ‘deemed necessary by 
the investigator’. A total of 96.7% of subjects who fulfilled retreatment criteria also received an active 
VTE injection. 
• 
Primary Efficacy Variable: Change in BCVA Score from Baseline until Week 24 
Mean BCVA at Baseline was comparable in the VTE group and in the Sham group. At Week 24, the mean 
change from Baseline in the VTE group was 12.1 letters and -2.0 letters in the Sham group.  
Using the ANCOVA model, after adjusting country effect and Baseline BCVA measurement, the difference 
between treatment groups in Least Square (LS) mean changes from baseline to Week 24 was 
14.1 ETDRS letters, with a 95% CI of 10.8-17.4 and a p-value < 0.0001.  
Table 8 - Change in BCVA letter score from Baseline until Week 24, ANCOVA (FAS, LOCF) 
The results when reproduced in the PPS showed a very similar trend. 
Sensitivity analyses (OC, Mixed Model for Repeated Measurements and Multiple Imputation) were 
consistent with the primary analysis.

Results in subgroups (country, sex, age groups, Baseline BCVA score, duration of target disease, renal 
impairment, hepatic impairment, number of active injections and antibody status) were all favouring the 
VTE groups over the Sham groups and were consistent for the FAS and PPS. In the VTE subjects receiving 
1, 2, 3 and > 3 active injections, the mean changes from Baseline in BCVA were 11.8 letters (n=19), 
14.4 letters (n=25), 13.8 letters (n=22) and 8.3 letters (n=24), respectively.  
The mean change from Baseline at Week 24 in BCVA score in Japanese was compared to non-Japanese. 
Using the LOCF approach (FAS), in the VTE 2 mg group, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 
24, was 10.9 letters vs 15.6 letters, in Japanese (n=67) and non-Japanese Asian subjects (n=23), 
respectively. In the Sham group, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline at Week 24, was -3.7 letters 
versus 2.8 letters in Japanese (n=23) and in non-Japanese subjects (n=8), respectively. Using the 
ANCOVA model with baseline BCVA measurement adjustment (LOCF, FAS), difference between treatment 
groups in LS mean changes from baseline to Week 24 was 14.8 letters (95% CI [10.8-18.8], p-value < 
0.0001) and 11.8 letters (95% CI [5.8-17.9], p-value=0.0004) for Japanese and non-Japanese Asian 
subjects, respectively. This differences was primarily driven by one single subject in the sham group of 
the non-Japanese group who was withdrawn from study treatment due to a serious adverse event but 
subsequently treated with 2 injections of ranibizumab leading to a gain of 10 letters of BCVA at Week 24. 
LOCF analysis excluding this patient from the sham group result in BCVA gains at a similar level for 
Japanese and non-Japanese Asians (14.8 versus 13.2). 
Results for Week 48 and over time 
The mean changes in BCVA score at Week 48 compared to Baseline (FAS, LOCF) were 13.5 letters and 
3.9 letters in the VTE 2 mg group and Sham+VTE 2 mg group, respectively. The between-group 
difference of 9.5 letters (LS mean) was statistically significant (p<0.0001). 
Mean changes at Week 48 when compared to the Week 24 results (time point corresponding to the 
‘active treatment Baseline’ for the Sham patients who completed the primary endpoint assessment at 
Week 24) were 1.4 letters and 7.9 letters in the VTE 2 mg group (N=83) and Sham+VTE 2 mg group 
(N=25), respectively. The improvement in the Sham+VTE 2 mg group from Week 24 to Week 48 was not 
as marked as previously observed in the VTE 2 mg group from Baseline to Week 24. 
Sensitivity analyses (OC) showed a similar trend as FAS, LOCF.  
When analysing data by dosing subgroups, the mean BCVA changes from Baseline in the VTE subjects for 
1, 2, 3 and >3 injections were 16.7; 15; 14.5 and 11.1 letters gain respectively. In a post-hoc analysis, 
in the VTE 2 mg group, results were as follows for patients receiving 1-3 active injections: 15.2 ± 8.0 
letters, 4-6 active injections: 13.8 ± 8.8 letters, 7-9 active injections: 10.3 ± 10.9 letters, and 10-12 
active injections: 4.9 ± 5.8 letters. Therefore with a higher number of injections, gains in VA were more 
limited similarly to what was observed at Week 24. 
With regards to changes in BCVA over time, in the VTE group, the mean change in BCVA from Baseline 
increased as early as Week 4 (+ 7.4 letters) compared to a mean change of -1.9 letters in the Sham 
group (see Figure 2).

•  Secondary Efficacy Variable: Proportion of patients with ≥15 letter gain in BCVA from Baseline 
until Week 24 
An overview of categorical changes in BCVA over time is provided in Table 9. At Week 24, the proportion 
of VTE 2 mg subjects who had gained at least 15 letters in BCVA was 38.9% (35/90) whereas in the 
Sham group, this proportion was clearly lower with 9.7% (3/31). After weight-adjusting by country using 
two sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, the difference between treatment groups was 29.2% in 
favour of VTE with a 95% CI of 14.4%-44.0% and a p-value of 0.0001.   
Sensitivity analyses (OC, worst case imputation) were consistent with the FAS, LOCF analysis.

Exploratory Efficacy Variables: 
Mean change from baseline in BCVA as measured by ETDRS at each visit and at Week 48 
Results are summarised with the primary variable (see above). 
Vision gains and losses ≥ 5, 10, or 15 letters at each visit and at Week 24 and 48 
During the first 24 weeks, a rapid increase in the percentage of patients gaining at least 15 letter in BCVA 
was observed in the VTE group as early as Week 4 and Week 8 (see Figure 3). Thereafter, the percentage 
of letter gains progressed slowly (from 32.2% at Week 12, to 38.9% at Week 24). A similar tendency was 
also observed for the gains of at least 10 or 5 letters (see Table 9).

Week 48 (FAS, LOCF) 
Table 9 – Overview of Proportion of Subjects with BCVA Gains/Loss of ≥5, ≥10, or ≥15 ETDRS 
Letters over Time through Week 24 (FAS) 
At Week 48, the differences in the proportion of subjects who gained ≥15 letters still favoured VTE (50%) 
over Sham+VTE (29%), with a CMH-adjusted difference of 21.0%;  95% CI [1.9; 40.1] (p=0.0308). This 
was not replicated when using the FAS, OC analysis (difference of 50% in the VTE group versus 37.5% in 
the Sham+VTE group, with a CMH-adjusted difference of 13.1%; 95% CI [-9.4; 35.6], (p=0.2541). 
These results again reflecting the improvement of the Sham+VTE group from Week 24 with the initiation 
of the VTE active treatment. Similar results at Week 48 were obtained for the proportion of subjects who 
gained either ≥10 or ≥5 letters.

Vision losses remained very limited in the VTE groups compared to the Sham groups. Deterioration by 
≥15, ≥10 or ≥5 letters occurred only sporadically in the VTE 2 mg group, while such events were 
consistently more frequent in the Sham+VTE 2 mg group with a trend to decrease after Week 24. 
By Week 48, nominally significant differences were found in the FAS, LOCF analyses for ≥5 (p=0.0012) 
and ≥10 letter (p=0.035) losers, but not for ≥15 letter losers (p=0.2446). Using the OC analysis no 
significant differences between groups were seen in either score loss (≥15 letters, p=0.4975; ≥10 letters, 
p=0.1002; ≥5 letters, p=0.1014).

The difference in CRT reduction between the VTE and Sham groups at Week 24 favoured active treatment 
(p<0.0001). Using the OC analysis, similarly, results favoured the VTE group. The difference between 
treatment groups was -67.7 µm; 95% CI [-94.3, -41.1], p <0001. 
The VTE group showed a rapid reduction in CRT beginning at Weeks 4 and 8 post-Baseline, which 
stabilized through Week 24 (see Figure 4). At Week 48, subjects in the VTE group maintained their 
improvement in CRT (-83.1μm) whereas in the Sham+VTE group, with the initiation at Week 24 of the 
VTE active treatment, an improvement in CRT was observed, mainly perceptible between Week 24 and 
Week 32 (-56.7 ± 119.0 μm from Baseline). The between-group difference at Week 48 was -29.3 μm 
(p=0.0650, LOCF). 
The results of the analyses of Japanese subjects using the LOCF method were similar to those for the 
entire study population.

Change in CNV lesion size (DA) from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 
The Baseline CNV lesion size was lower in the Sham group (0.3401 DA vs 0.4346 DA). Using ANCOVA to 
adjust for country and Baseline values, the difference observed at Week 24 in CNV lesion size between 
treatment groups was significantly in favour of VTE (see Table 11). Using the FAS, OC analysis results 
displayed a similar trend with a difference between treatment groups of -0.50 DA, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.37], 
p<0.0001. 
By Week 48, the LOCF analysis for the (smaller compared to Week 24) adjusted treatment difference of -
0.1346 DA still showed a nominally significant difference between treatment groups, while the analysis of 
observed cases did not.

Change in area of leakage (DA) from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 
Using an ANCOVA model, after adjusting country effect and Baseline values, the difference observed 
between treatment groups in area of leakage at Week 24 was significantly in favour of VTE. The FAS OC 
results displayed a similar trend with a treatment difference of -0.647 DA, 95% CI [-0.803,-0.492], 
p <0001. The between-group difference diminished, but remained statistically significant by Week 48 for 
both the LOCF and the OC analyses.

Change in total NEI-VFQ-25 and EQ-5D score from Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 
The National Eye Institute 25-item Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) was used to assess the 
efficacy of IVT administration of VTE on vision related quality of life (QoL) [NEI VFQ-25 total score 
assessed bilateral functional vision and range from 0 (worse possible state) to 100 (best possible state)].  
The total NEI-VFQ-25 mean score showed a slight increase from Baseline at Week 24 in the VTE group 
and a slight decrease in the Sham group (see Table 13). The difference between treatment groups was 
5.21 points (LOCF), favouring VTE, p=0.0104. This was not replicated for the OC analysis with a 
difference of 2.92 points, p=0.1610. Similar results were obtained for Week 48.

The EQ-5D questionnaire was used to assess the overall health status of the subject. 
At Week 24, as shown in Table 14, after adjusting the Baseline values, the comparison of mean change of 
EQ-5D score between groups did not show any significant difference either in the LOCF or OC analysis 
(difference between groups: -0.0020, 95% CI [-0.0607, 0.0566], p=0.9451). At Week 48, the mean 
change from Baseline was 0.0154 score points in the VTE group and -0.0252 in the Sham+VTE group. 
The adjusted treatment difference between groups was 0.0517 score points (95%-CI: [0.0022; 0.1011],

Proportion of subjects who withdrew from study drug by Week 24 and Week 48 
Through Week 24, a total of 13 subjects discontinued study treatment including 7 (7.7%) in the 
VTE group and 6 (19.4%) in the Sham group: Six subjects with efficacy data after Baseline of each 
treatment group (6.7% in VTE group vs. 19.4% in Sham group) were included in this analysis. One 
subject in the VTE group who dropped out after the first injection but without any post-baseline BCVA 
measurement was not considered. A 2-sided CMH test adjusted by country showed no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups (p=0.1012).

Clinical studies in special populations 
The development program for Eylea in mCNV was based on one pivotal trial (MYRROR) that, owing to the 
high prevalence of mCNV in subjects of Asian race, was conducted exclusively in East-Asian countries 
(Japan, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan). Therefore, the Applicant has conducted 
an evaluation of the ethnical insensitivity of VTE in Asians and Whites including intrinsic factors and 
extrinsic factors in line with International Conference on Harmonization ICH E5 guidance, in order to 
justify extrapolation of data from MYRROR to other ethnicities and geographic regions, in particular 
European patients. 
For  the  main  analysis  of  ethnical  insensitivity,  clinical  trials  conducted  with  VTE  in  other  approved 
indications  were  considered.  Statistical  evaluation  of  comparisons  included  descriptive  statistics  and 
regression  analyses.  The  main  efficacy  results  used  for  comparison  were  based  on  the  assessment  of 
BCVA and CRT improvements. 
The  data  pooling  of  the  bridging  report  included  1104  subjects.  Among  them,  the  majority  were 
Caucasian (884, i.e. 80%) including 536 AMD, 156 CRVO and 385 DME patients (see Table 16). 
Table 16 – Sample Size of Asians and Whites by Indication/Study and Treatment Group 
Absolute treatment differences between Asians and Whites showed generally similar efficacy trends 
between treatment groups. This was confirmed by consistent overlaps of the corresponding 95%

Impact of intrinsic factors 
The assessment of the impact of intrinsic factors was mainly based the systematic review of intrinsic 
factors originating from the Phase III trial data of VTE in Asians and Whites (see above), as well as 
published literature. 
Extrinsic factors 
Extrinsic  factors  are  factors  associated  with  environment  and  culture,  which  may  differ  between 
geographic region and which may impact efficacy and safety of a drug.  
The analyses of extrinsic factors included the following: 
• 
• 
IVT administration of VTE in retinal diseases in East Asia as compared to Europe (North America 
and Australia) 
The medical practice of the diagnosis and treatment of mCNV in East Asia as compared to Europe, 
North America and Australia 
These analyses did not identify any extrinsic factors that would indicate the potential for ethnical 
sensitivity of VTE in East Asia as compared to Europe (or other geographic regions with a mainly White 
population including North America and Australia). 
PK results 
Exploratory subgroup analyses did not reveal any relevant influence of age, sex, BMI, renal function, 
medical history of hepatic impairment, or geographic region (Europe/Japan, Japan/non-Japan) on the 
plasma concentrations of free or bound aflibercept.  
See section 2.3.2. for results from MYRROR. 
Safety results

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy assessment of this application was based on the results of the pivotal, randomized, Sham-
controlled phase III study MYRROR including 122 Asian adult subjects with visual impairment due to 
mCNV who were followed over a period of 48 weeks. In addition, the MAH presented the result of a 
systematic review to support ethnic insensitivity of VTE treatment based on existing clinical data for Eylea 
in wet AMD, CRVO and DME patients. 
No  dose-response  study  was  conducted.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  the  choice  of  a  2  mg  dose 
appropriate as this was the same dose shown effective in all existing indications.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  design  of  the  pivotal  MYRROR  study  was  considered  generally  acceptable  by  the  CHMP,  albeit  the 
study  size  was  limited.  The  3:1  ratio  of  randomisation  adds  further  limitation  to  the  size  of  the 
comparator arm (Sham) and subgroup analyses.  
The choice of Sham as comparator was accepted by the CHMP, since, as explained by the MAH, vPDT was 
not  an  approved  treatment  in  Japan,  where  the  majority  of  subjects  were  recruited  into  the  study. 
However, since in Europe, ranibizumab has been approved for treatment of vision impairment secondary 
to mCNV in 2013, potential future studies would be expected to use it as active comparator. 
The  population  studied  in  MYRROR  included  only  Asian  patients,  the  majority  of  which  were  Japanese. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  results  of  MYRROR  alone,  no  conclusions  for  the  European  population  could  be 
drawn.  Additional  data  supporting  the  extrapolation  of  MYRROR  to  other  ethnicities  and  geographic 
regions are discussed below. 
The  inclusion-exclusion  criteria  were  appropriate  to  select  subjects  with  Baseline  characteristics 
representative  of  a  severe  myopic  population  naïve  to  treatment,  with  subfoveal  or  juxtafoveal  mCNV. 
Patients with extrafoveal lesions and those who had previously undergone treatment with vPDT were not 
included and the CHMP considered that this should be reflected in SmPC section 4.4.  
The  study  protocol  specified  an  initial  mandatory  injection  in  the  active  treatment  arm  followed  by 
additional  VTE  injections  as  needed,  based  on  pre-defined  retreatment  criteria  to  be  applied  by  the 
treating  specialist.  This  approach  was  considered  acceptable  given  the  experience  with  other  VEGF 
inhibitors. 
The choice of efficacy variables and endpoints at Week 24 and 48 were also considered suitable by the 
CHMP, whereby patients in the Sham group switched to active treatment as of Week 24.  
Demographic  and  disease  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
groups. The majority of subjects were female (n=92; 76.0%) and PM is known to occur more frequently 
in  women  than  in  men.  The  majority  of  the  patients  recruited  had  a  recent  diagnosis  of  mCNV  (i.e. 
disease duration of <2 months) which was in line with the recommended management of mCNV to avoid 
an irreversible degradation of vision over time. The CHMP furthermore noted the large range of age from 
27 to 83 years.  
Nevertheless, there was a marked difference in the incidence of cataract in the study eye history between 
active  and  control  patients  with  a  higher  incidence  in  the  VTE  2 mg  group  (24.2%)  compared  to  the 
Sham+VTE  2 mg  group  (6.5%).  However,  the  difference  was  considerably  reduced  when  applying  the 
standardized  MedDRA  query  (57.1% in  the  VTE  group  versus  38.7%  for  Sham)  rather  than  only  the  PT 
‘cataract’.  Furthermore,  the  occurrence  of  active  cataracts  (i.e.  not  resolved  before  study  enrolment  or 
data  missing)  was  broadly  similar  in  both  treatment  arms  (38.5%  in  the  VTE  group  versus  25.8%  for 
Sham). Therefore, and since both VA and CRT were similar in both treatment arms, the CHMP concluded 
that there was no meaningful difference between the two treatment groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 43/72 
 
  
  
The CHMP also noted that the non-ocular medical and surgical history profile of patients was not balanced 
between  the  treatment  groups  with  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  VTE  group  with  prior  or 
concomitant medications for treatment of the cardiovascular or neurological systems. However, data from 
a  post-hoc  efficacy  analysis  showed  a  favorable  outcome  both  in  the  entire  study  population  and  in 
individual  subgroups.  The  subgroups  with  prior  or  concomitant  medications  for  treatment  of 
cardiovascular  or  neurological  systems  generally  had  slightly  smaller  numerical  improvements  in  BCVA 
compared to the overall population. Therefore, any imbalances with regard to the history of patients did 
not pose a risk of overestimating efficacy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  at  Week  24  showed  that  the  treatment  with  Eylea  was  associated  with  a 
statically and clinically relevant beneficial effect, superior to Sham treatment. The mean change in BCVA 
from  Baseline  was  12.1  letters  in  the  VTE  group  and  -2.0  letters  in  the  Sham  group,  resulting  in  a 
difference  of  14  letters  between  groups  (p<0.0001).  With  VTE  treatment,  a  rapid  increase in  BCVA  was 
observed  as  early  as  Week  4  that  still  progressed  through  24  weeks,  but  more  modestly  later  on. 
Between  Week  24  and  48,  the  level  of  improvement  was  maintained  or  slightly  improved  in  the  VTE 
group. Similarly, there was an improvement in BCVA by 7.9 letters in the Sham+VTE group at Week 48 
compared to Week 24, when patients in the Sham group started to receive active treatment. Notably, this 
improvement was less pronounced than in the VTE  group at Week 24 compared to Baseline, suggesting 
that patients benefit from early treatment, while if mCNV is left untreated irreversible damage may occur. 
This is in line with previous findings for anti-VEGF agents and current mCNV treatment recommendations. 
The  results  of  the  primary  analysis  were  supported  by  the  findings  for  the  secondary  endpoint,  a 
responder analysis defining a group of patients with a clinically meaningful gain of 15 or more letters. The 
difference  in  responder  rates  between  treatment  groups  at  Week  24  was  29.2%  demonstrating  a 
significant superiority of VTE over Sham with a p-value of 0.0001. Analyses at Week 48 still favoured the 
VTE group, but the difference was less pronounced (CMH adjusted difference of 21%, p=0.0308), which 
can be ascribed to the beneficial effect of VTE treatment as of Week 24 in the Sham+VTE group.  
An effect of VTE treatment was also demonstrated for anatomical outcomes. VTE treatment resulted in a 
reduction of CRT by -85.7 μm at Week 24 compared to Baseline, while CRT remained unchanged in the 
Sham  group  (-7.8  μm).  The  between-group  difference  of  77.9  µm  in  CRT  was  statistically  significant  in 
favour of active treatment (p<0.0001). Similar to the improvement in BCVA over time, there was a rapid 
reduction CRT in the VTE arm beginning at Week 4 which thereafter stabilized through Week 24 and was 
maintained until the end of the study at Week 48. As for BCVA, with the initiation of active treatment at 
Week  24,  patients  in  the  Sham+VTE  group  experienced  an  improvement  in  CRT  mainly  perceptible 
between  Week  24  and  Week  32  (-56.7  μm  from  Baseline).  However,  the  improvement  was  less 
pronounced than in the VTE arm during the first 6 months. 
Additional  exploratory  variables  (change  in  CNV  lesion  size  and  in  area  of  leakage,  as  well  as  quality  of 
life)  also  showed  results generally  supportive  of  a  beneficial  effect of  VTE  treatment  consistent  with  the 
primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Only very few patients in the VTE group lost 5 or more letters 
by Week 24 and no patients worsened by 10 letters and beyond, while this was the case for a quarter of 
all patients in the Sham group. 
Sensitivity analyses generally confirmed the results on the FAS, LOCF. 
Notably,  14%  of  patients  in  the  VTE  group  only  required  1  injection  in  the  48-week  study  period,  and 
nearly 60% required no more than 3 injections. The most common reasons for re-treatment were new or 
persistent  CNV  or  bleeding,  and  investigator’s  discretion.  Overall,  the  mean  number  of  active  injections 
needed  in  the  VTE  arm  over  the  total  period  of  study  was  low  with  <  4.5  injections  (3  for  the  first  6 
months  and  thereafter  only  1.5).  An  increased  number  of  injections  over  the  24  or  48  weeks  did  not

seem to result in higher improvements in VA, but quite the opposite with more limited gains in VA. These 
data  showed  that in  some  patients the  disease  may  be  controlled  with  a  single  injection.  Therefore, the 
recommended  dosing  regimen  of  an  initial  injection  followed  by  additional  doses  as  needed,  based  on 
visual  and/or  anatomic  outcomes,  at  intervals  of  no  less  than  4  weeks,  was  agreed  by  the  CHMP. 
However, the CHMP noted that this regimen differed from the recommendation for the others indications 
as  no  initial  repeated  monthly  dosing  was  required.  Drug  exposure  and  number  of  IVT  injections  would 
therefore be considerably less in mCNV patients compared to other target populations of Eylea. In order 
to better understand drug use in European clinical practice including frequency of injections in the mCNV 
population  compared  to  the  other  approved  indications,  the  MAH  proposed  to  include  mCNV  patients  in 
the  planned  observational  post-authorisation  safety  study  (PASS).  Primary  objectives  will  include  the 
utilization  of  intravitreal  aflibercept  in  real-world  clinical  practice  including  injection  frequency  by 
indication. It is planned to enroll 20,000 patients (i) with a macular disease for any indication approved in 
the EU, (ii) who are naïve to treatment with steroids and anti-VEGF drugs and (iii) for whom the decision 
was  made  to  initiate  IVT  treatment  with  aflibercept.  Patients  will  be  followed  over  an  individual 
observation  period  of  3 years.  This  proposal  was  acceptable  to  the  CHMP,  though  it  was  noted  that  the 
study protocol was still being reviewed at the time of this report. 
In  order  to  extrapolate  the  data  from  MYRROR  which  included  only  Asian  patients,  to  the  European 
population,  the  MAH  carried  out  a  systematic  review  of  ethnic  insensitivity  of  VTE  following  the  ICH  E5 
guidance.  The  methodology  used  by  the  MAH  was  considered  appropriate  with  regards  to  the  choice  of 
criteria  among  Asian  and  Caucasian  populations  and  the  data  from  previous  VTE  studies  in  AMD,  CRVO 
and  DME  patients.  The  level  of  efficacy  was  broadly  comparable  between  Asian  and  Caucasian  patients 
across the three indications. While there was some variability in the results possibly due to the fact that 
some  of  the  sample  sizes  were  rather  small,  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  systematic  difference  between 
Asian  and  Caucasian  patients.  There  were  also  no  major  differences  between  the  ethnic  groups  with 
regards to PK and safety outcomes (see section 2.5.1. for the discussion on safety). There was a certain 
degree  of  descriptive  heterogeneity  when  comparing  the  responses  to  treatment  within  the  same 
indication  (punctual  assessment)  in  the  two  selected  populations,  albeit  not  reaching  statistical 
significance.  The  finding  was  discussed  in  detail  and  found  to  be likely  attributable to  random  variation. 
Furthermore,  when  considering  the  course  of  the  entire  period  of  treatment,  the  data  were  rather 
favoring  the  VTE  Caucasian  groups  in  either  indication  which  was  reassuring.  Overall,  there  was  no 
reason  to  suspect  that  intrinsic  or  extrinsic  factors  such  as  diagnostic  methodology,  environmental  or 
cultural factors will affect the efficacy of Eylea in either group. It was reasonable to assume that the same 
applies  to  the  mCNV  indication  and  therefore,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  results  of  the  MYRROR  study 
could be extrapolated to the EU population. Nevertheless, the CHMP was of the view that the absence of 
data  in  non-Asian  patients  should  be  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  The  CHMP  further  noted  that  inclusion  of 
mCNV patients in the drug utilization study, while not primarily designed for efficacy, should contribute to 
further document the effects of Eylea in Caucasians. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered that the available data were sufficient to support the application for use of Eylea in 
the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to mCNV. The pivotal MYRROR study provided 
highly  convincing  clinical  and  statistical  findings  for  both  visual  and  morphologic  outcomes  in  the  Asian, 
treatment-naïve  population.  Extrapolation  of  the  study  data  to  the  European  population  was  considered 
acceptable  based  on  a  systematic  review  conducted  by  the  MAH  suggesting  that  VTE  treatment  is  not 
sensitive to Asian versus non-Asian race. 
In  order  to  better  understand  the  use  of  Eylea  including  frequency  of  injections  in  European  clinical 
practice, the MAH proposed to include mCNV patients in the planned observational PASS.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This evaluation of safety of VTE for the treatment of mCNV was mainly based on the 48 weeks data from 
the  pivotal  phase  III  study  MYRROR.  In  addition,  post-marketing  safety  data  for  VEGF  Trap-Eye  were 
presented with a cut-off date of 31 January 2014. 
Further  supportive  data  were  available  from  the  clinical  development  program  of  existing  indications  of 
Eylea  (AMD,  RVO  and  DME).  This  includes  a  large  clinical  safety  database  of  2230  AMD  subjects,  291 
CRVO subjects, 578 DME subjects and 91 BRVO subjects who had received Eylea.  
In MYRROR, adverse events (AEs) were classified as 
•  Drug related: if there was a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study drug. A 
possible example of a drug-related AE would be a hypersensitivity reaction. 
• 
• 
Injection related: if there was a reasonable possibility that the event occurred as a result of the 
IVT injection or sham procedure. A possible example of an injection-related AE would be eye pain 
at the site of the injection  
Procedure  related:  if  there  was  a  reasonable  possibility  that  the  event  occurred  as  a  result  of 
participation in the study but was not associated with the injection (i.e., VTE/sham) procedure. A 
possible example of a procedure-related AE would be bruising at the site of a blood draw. 
Patient exposure 
The SAF of MYRROR included all patients who received any study treatment (VTE or Sham). A total of 122 
Asian subjects were randomized including 91 in the VTE group and 31 in the Sham+VTE group. Subjects 
were evaluated at 4-week intervals for safety.  
As expected because of the treatment schedule with a planned longer exposure period in the VTE 2 mg 
group  starting  at  Baseline,  mean  and  median  duration  of  exposure,  mean  cumulative  amount  of 
administered  VTE,  and  mean  injection  volume  were  higher  in  VTE  group  compared  to  the  Sham+VTE 
group (see Table 20). In the Sham+VTE 2 mg group, subjects did not receive their first active injection 
until Week 24. 
Table 20 – Extent of Exposure through Week 48 in MYRROR (SAF) 
During  the  first  24  weeks  of  treatment,  the  mean  total  exposure  to  VTE  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 46/72 
 
  
  
 
5.8 mg  (standard  deviation,  SD=3.3),  over  a  mean  duration  of  163  days  (SD=24.8)  and  none  in  the 
Sham group.  
Exposure by number of active injections is summarised in section 2.4.2. (Table 7) for the FAS. 
During the first 24 weeks of the MYRROR study, 22% (20/91) of subjects in the VTE group (SAF) received 
only 1 active injection (at Baseline), and 74% of VTE subjects received 3 or fewer active injections. Over 
the  whole  duration  of  the  study,  59%  (54/91)  of  VTE  subjects  received  1-3  active  injections,  while  this 
number was 45% (14/31) for the Sham+VTE 2 mg group, where active treatment only started at Week 
24. By the end of the study, 75 subjects (82.4%) in the VTE 2 mg group and 24 subjects (77.4%) in the 
Sham+VTE 2mg group had received the complete set of 12 injections (i.e., active or sham). 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups completed the treatment for the first 24 weeks of the 
study,  including  83  (91.2%)  subjects  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  and  25  (80.6%)  in  the  Sham  group  (see 
section 2.4.2. and Table 2 for disposition of study subjects). A total of 14 (11.5%) subjects discontinued 
the  study  treatment  prior  to  Week  24.  The  most  frequently  reported  primary  reasons  for  premature 
discontinuation of the study drug in the first 24 weeks were adverse events in 3 (3.3%) subjects of the 
VTE 2 mg group and 2 (6.5%) in the Sham group. 
Demographic  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment  groups  and  are 
summarised in section 2.4.2. (Table 3) for the FAS.  
Adverse events 
The majority of patients (69.7%, n=85) in both treatment groups experienced AEs: 71.4% (n=65) in the 
VTE 2 mg group and 64.5% (n=20) in the Sham+VTE group (see Table 21). 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  any  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  up  to  Week  48  was  67.2%.  The 
incidence of TEAEs was lower in the Sham+VTE group (58.1%) than in the VTE 2 mg group (70.3%). This 
difference  between  treatment  groups  was  mainly  due  to  non-ocular  TEAEs,  which  were  reported  for 
38.7%  of  the  Sham+VTE  group  compared  with  58.2%  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group.  This  difference  between 
treatment groups already exists in the analysis conducted on the Week 24 data, with an incidence of non-
ocular TEAEs of 44.0% in the VTE 2 mg group vs. 32.3% in the Sham+VTE group.  
Injection related TEAEs were reported slightly more frequently in the VTE 2 mg group (same as at Week 
24), with 20% versus 13 % in the Sham+VTE group. Procedure related TEAEs occurred exclusively in the 
VTE 2 mg group, with 13% (n=12) compared with none in the Sham+VTE group.

Ocular TEAEs 
By  Week  48,  ocular  TEAEs  had  been  reported  in  37%  of  VTE  2  mg  subjects  compared  with 39%  in  the 
Sham+VTE group. In both treatment groups, the incidence of ocular TEAEs was higher in the study eye 
than the fellow eye. The overall incidence of ocular TEAE in the study eye was 33% compared with 20% 
in the fellow eye. An overview of ocular TAEs at Week 24 and 48 is provided in Table 23 and Table 24. 
After initiation of active treatment in the Sham+VTE group at Week 24, the incidence of ocular TEAEs in 
the study eye at Week 48 was similar between groups or even slightly lower in the VTE 2 mg group (from 
Week 24 to Week 48: 32% VTE 2 mg group vs. 36% Sham+VTE group; from Baseline to Week 24: 23% 
VTE 2 mg group vs. 19% Sham group). 
As judged by the investigator, ocular TEAEs in the study eye were considered to be related to study drug 
in  6.6%  of  the  subjects  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  compared  with  3.2%  of  the  subjects  in  the  Sham+VTE 
group.  In  both  treatment  groups,  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye  were  about  twice  as  often  considered 
related  to  the  injection  procedure  than  the  study  drug.  Injection-related  TEAEs  at  Week  48  were  still 
reported slightly more frequently in the VTE 2 mg group with 19.8% (Week 24: 16.5%) vs. 12.9 % in the 
Sham+VTE  group  (the  latter  incidence  remained  unchanged  compared  to  Week  24).  Procedure-related 
ocular TEAEs occurred exclusively in the VTE 2 mg group through Week 48 with 6.6% (Week 24: 5.5%) 
compared with none in the Sham+VTE group.  
All  but  one  ocular  TEAE  were  mild  (34.4%)  or  moderate  (2.5%)  in  severity.  One  (0.8%)  severe  ocular 
TEAE in the study eye (macular hole, VTE 2 mg group) was also categorized as a serious adverse events 
(SAE)  due  to  the  need  for  hospitalization.  It  was  the  only  SAE  assessed  as  related  to  study  drug,  to  a 
protocol-required  procedure,  and  to  the  injection  procedure.  This  event  occurred  in  the  second  study 
period.

Non-ocular TEAEs 
The  incidence  of  non-ocular  TEAEs  at  Week  24  was  44.0%  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  and  32.3%  in  the 
Sham+VTE  group.  From  Week  24  to  Week  48,  the  incidence  was  33.0%  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  and 
12.9% in the Sham+VTE group. The proportion of subjects experiencing at least one non-ocular TEAE by 
Week 48 was still higher in the VTE 2 mg group with 58.2% versus 38.7% in the Sham+VTE With regard 
to SOC, the highest incidences of non-ocular TEAEs were seen for ‘infections and infestations’ (26.4% in 
the VTE 2 mg group and 25.8% in the Sham+VTE group), followed by ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (15.4% 
in the VTE 2 mg group and 6.5% in the Sham+VTE group) and ‘nervous system disorders’ (16.5% in the 
VTE  2  mg  group  and  3.2%  in  the  Sham+VTE  group).  Most  of  the  non-ocular  TEAEs  were  reported  as 
single events.  
The  most  commonly  reported  non-ocular  TEAEs  occurring  in  ≥5%  of  all  subjects  were  nasopharyngitis 
(18.7% VTE 2 mg; 9.7% Sham+VTE group),  headache (6.6% VTE 2 mg; 3.2% Sham+VTE group), and 
nausea (7.7% VTE 2 mg; 0.0% Sham+VTE group). 
Four  subjects  overall  experienced  a  non-ocular  TEAE  considered  to  be  related  to  the  study  drug 
(3 subjects in the VTE 2 mg treatment group and one subject in the Sham group). No non-ocular TEAEs 
were considered to be related to the injection. Eight subjects, all in the VTE  2 mg group, experienced a 
procedure-related, non-ocular TEAE. One subject in the VTE 2 mg treatment group was reported to have 
had  a  severe  non-ocular  TEAE,  a  cerebral  haemorrhage  that  occurred  in  the  first  study  period  and  was 
also categorized as SAE because of the need for hospitalization.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
In  the  VTE  2  mg  group,  7  of  the  91  patients  (7.7%)  experienced  a  treatment-emergent  SAE,  including 
3 patients (3.3%) with ocular and 4 patients (4.4%) with non-ocular SAEs. 
Three  (3)  events  were  reported  during  the  first  24  weeks  of  the  study,  but  not  considered  related  to 
study  treatment.  These  were  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  cerebral  haemorrhage  and 
depression.  
The case of severe cerebral haemorrhage occurred in a subject in the VTE 2 mg treatment group 3 weeks 
after the third injection of Eylea during the first study period and was categorized as SAE because of the 
need for hospitalization. The patients was a 58-year old woman without relevant medical history, who at 
the same time developed hypertension of moderate intensity. Both events were not considered as related 
to study drug. The idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura of moderate intensity occurred in a subject with 
history  of  Sjogren’s  syndrome  and  required  prolonged  hospitalization.  The  case  of  mild  depression 
required prolonged hospitalization and recovered after 10 days.   
Between  Week  24  and  Week  48  of  the  MYRROR  study,  SAEs  were  reported  in  additional  4  subjects, 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 52/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including  CNV  secondary  to  pathologic  myopia,  macular  hole  (2  subjects),  and  Moraxella-positive 
pneumonia.  
One of the ocular SAEs (macular hole) occurred in the study eye, the other 2 ocular SAEs (macular hole 
and CNV) occurred in the  fellow eye. The severe macular hole in the study eye was also categorized as 
SAE due to the need for hospitalization. It occurred 1 month after the first injection and was the only SAE 
assessed  by  the  investigator  as  related  to  study  drug,  to  a  protocol-required  procedure,  and  to  the 
injection  procedure  and  required  vitrectomy.  Both  subjects  with  the  SAEs  macular  hole  continued 
treatment,  but  the  subject  with  CNV  in  the  fellow  eye  was  discontinued.  However,  the  case  of  macular 
hole in the study eye led to study drug interruption. The subject was recovering thereafter. For all other 
ocular  SAEs,  the  investigators  did  not  suspect  any  causal  relationship  in  connection  with  the  subjects’ 
study participation. 
Bacterial pneumonia was considered to be of moderate intensity and led to the subject’s hospitalization. 
The subject recovered within 4 weeks. The SAE was not considered to be related to study drug treatment, 
but the treatment was temporarily interrupted. There were no non-ocular drug-related SAEs reported in 
any subject in either treatment group through week 48. 
In the Sham+VTE group, the only SAE reported was ‘visual acuity reduced’ in one patient, which occurred 
in the study eye and was considered unrelated to treatment or injection. 
Deaths 
No subjects died during the entire study period of 48 weeks. 
Adverse events of interest 
AEs of interest were reviewed in line with the safety concerns in the risk management plan (RMP). 
•  Endophthalmitis (important identified risk ) 
No endophthalmitis cases were reported in the MYRROR study through Week 48. 
•  Any intraocular inflammatory eye reactions regardless of suspected aetiology (important identified 
risk in the RMP) 
One patient experienced an intraocular inflammation in MYRROR. This patient belonged to the VTE 2 mg 
group.  The  underlying  event  (PT:  Anterior  chamber  cell)  was  non-serious,  of  mild  severity  and  had 
resolved.  
• 
Transient intraocular pressure (IOP) increase (important identified risk) 
No  AE  of  increased  IOP  in  the  study  eye  were  reported  in  MYRROR.  Mean  pre-injection  IOP  was 
considered to be normal at Baseline in both treatment groups (15.3 ± 2.7 mmHg in the VTE 2 mg group 
and 15.8 ±2.8 mmHg in the Sham+VTE group). There were no relevant mean changes from Baseline at 
Week 48 in either treatment group. None of the study subjects experienced an increase by ≥10 mmHg in 
pre-dose  IOP  compared  to  Baseline  or  had  reported  an  absolute  IOP  value  of  ≥35  mmHg  at  any  time. 
The  number  of  subjects  with  an  absolute  pre-dose  IOP  measurement  of  >21  mmHg  was  small  at  each 
visit  in  either  treatment  group,  and  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  over  time  or  imbalances  between 
treatment groups were observed. 
•  Retinal pigment epithelium tears or rips (important identified risk) 
No cases of retinal pigment epithelium tears were reported in MYRROR. 
•  Retinal tear / detachment (important identified risk) 
TEAEs  pertaining  to  the  group  retinal tear  /  detachment  were  reported  in one  patient  in  the  Sham+VTE 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 53/72 
 
  
  
group (PT: retinal detachment) and in one patient in the VTE 2 mg group (PT: retinal tear). Both events 
were mild and non-serious; retinal tear was reported as resolved. 
•  Cataract, especially of traumatic origin (important identified risk) 
One  patient  experienced  cataract  in  MYRROR.  This  patient  was  treated  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group.  The 
underlying  event  (PT:  Cataract  subcapsular)  was  non-serious  and  had  a  mild  severity,  but  was  not 
resolved. No injection-related (i.e., traumatic) cataracts were reported in MYRROR through Week 48. 
•  Hypersensitivity and immunogenicity (important identified risk) 
No hypersensitivity cases were reported in the MYRROR study. 
Samples  for  the  assessment  of  ADAs  were  collected  prior  to  treatment  on  Day  1,  at  Week  24,  and  at 
Week 48. The results are described in section 2.3.3.  
By  Week  48,  in  both  treatment  groups  combined,  5  subjects  experienced  ocular  TEAEs  referring  to  the 
medical  entity  "non-infectious  inflammatory  eye  reactions  due  to  immunogenicity"  (PTs:  conjunctivitis, 
conjunctivitis allergic, eye allergy, and keratitis). In 4 subjects the event occurred in the study eye. These 
were 1 case each of conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, and keratitis (all in the VTE 2 mg group), and 1 
case of eye allergy in the Sham+VTE group. 
•  Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE, important potential risk) 
There was one TEAE during the study classified as an ATE. The subject in the VTE 2 mg group developed 
a  severe  cerebral  haemorrhage  resulting  in  prolonged  hospitalization  (serious  event).  The  subject  was 
reported  as  recovering  at  the  time  of  database  lock.  At  the  same  time,  this  subject  developed 
hypertension of moderate intensity that was reported on the same day (but not adjudicated as ATE). The 
study  drug  was  withdrawn  and  the  subject  was  reported  as  recovering  at  the  time  of  database  lock. 
Neither event was considered related to study drug. 
•  Venous thromboembolic events (important potential risk) 
No venous thromboembolic events were reported in the MYRROR study. 
•  Hypertension (important potential risk) 
Hypertension was reported in 4 subjects (4%) in the VTE 2 mg group compared with 1 subject (3.2%) in 
the  Sham  group  by  Week  48.  None  of  the  reported  events  remained  unresolved.  The  reported 
hypertension events were of mild or moderate intensity and no events were regarded as severe. 
Mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  values  in  the  MYRROR  study  did  not  change  to  a  clinically 
relevant extent from Baseline to Week 48 in either treatment group. 
• 
Proteinuria (important potential risk) 
One  case  of  proteinuria  occurred  in  the  VTE  2  mg group.  The  event  was  regarded  as  mild,  non-serious, 
and resolved. 
•  Non-ocular haemorrhage (important potential risk) 
By study end, 2 subjects in the VTE 2 mg group had experienced a TEAE pertaining to the group of non-
ocular  haemorrhage.  The  Anti-Platelet  Trialists'  Collaboration  ATE  event  cerebral  haemorrhage  was 
considered  serious  and  severe,  while  contusion  was  reported  to  be  non-serious  and  mild.  The  2  events 
were recovering/resolving and recovered/resolved, respectively. 
•  Medication error and misuse (important potential risk) 
No cases of medication error and misuse were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 54/72 
 
  
  
•  Off-label use (important potential risk) 
There were no reports of off-label use. 
•  Embryo-fetotoxicity (important potential risk) 
There were no reports of embryo-fetotoxicity. 
•  Retinal haemorrhage (important potential risk) 
One  case  of  retinal  haemorrhage  in  the  study  eye  was  reported  in  MYRROR.  This  event  occurred  in  the 
VTE 2 mg group, was considered non-serious and mild, and was resolved. 
Immunogenicity 
See above and section 2.3.3.  
Laboratory findings 
Several  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  and  urinalysis  parameters  were  tested  at  Screening,  Week  12, 
Week 24, Week 36, and Week 48. No safety concerns emerged from laboratory findings in the MYRROR 
study.  Laboratory  abnormalities  and  other  general  safety  parameters  were  determined  to  be  consistent 
with the patients' underlying disease and medical history. One patient prematurely discontinued the study 
due  to  impaired  liver  function  7  months  after  the  last  active  injection.  The  event  was  non-serious  and 
considered by the investigator as not related to the study drug. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsinc factors  
Several  subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  the  following  demographic  and 
disease variables on safety, including race (Japanese vs. non-Japanese), gender, age, visual impairment, 
duration of disease, renal and hepatic impairment as well as medical history (diabetes mellitus, cataracts, 
hypertension, cerebrovascular, myocardial infarction). 
•  Race/ethnicity 
MYRROR (mCNV) 
Overall,  there  was  a  higher  total  incidence  of  TEAEs  reported  for  Japanese  subjects  (90)  with  71.1% 
compared  to  non-Japanese  subjects  (32)  with  56.3%.  However,  less  Japanese  than  non-  Japanese 
subjects experienced ocular TEAEs in the study eye (31.1% vs. 37.5%) and in the fellow eye (14.4% vs. 
34.4%). However, the percentage of Japanese subjects with non-ocular TEAEs was markedly higher than 
in non-Japanese subjects (60.0% vs. 34.4%). 
The  incidences  of  drug-related  TEAEs,  procedure-related  TEAEs  and  injection-related  TEAEs  were 
consistently lower in Japanese than in non-Japanese subjects. 
Other indications 
In  order  to  support  the  claim  of  ethnical  insensitivity  of  VTE  and  thus  extrapolation  of  the  results  of 
MYRROR from the Asian population recruited to European mCNV patients, the MAH performed a systemic 
review  of  efficacy,  safety  and  PK  results  from  previous  clinical  trial  sin  existing  indications  (AMD,  CRVO 
and DME).  
With regard to the general safety of VTE in the existing indications in Asians compared with Non-Asians, it 
was noted that the Asian subgroups were consistently smaller (see section 2.4.2. and Table 16 for an 
overview of the sample sizes). Thus, the probability of detecting less frequent AEs in the Asian subgroups 
was a priori more limited if compared to the Caucasian subgroup. 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 55/72 
 
  
  
For any TEAE, Asian and White subjects with AMD and DME showed largely similar frequencies. For CRVO, 
TEAE frequencies showed a trend to lower frequencies in the Asian as compared to the White subgroup 
(69.2% vs. 85.9%); however, the sample size especially in the Asian subgroup was small. 
For any TEAE of severe intensity, frequencies were largely similar per indication in the White and Asian 
subgroups. For any SAEs, frequencies were lower in Asian than in White subjects for AMD and DME, but 
higher in Asian than in White subjects for CRVO. 
For drug-related TEAEs, frequencies were lower in Asian than in White subjects for AMD and CRVO, but 
higher in Asian than in White subjects for DME. For injection-related TEAEs, frequencies were higher in 
Asian than in Caucasian subjects for AMD and DME, but lower in Asian than in White subjects for CRVO. 
Discontinuations due to AEs were more frequently recorded for Asian than for White subjects for all three 
indications. 
•  Gender 
With the exception of a higher incidence of ocular TEAEs in the fellow eye (all were unrelated to the study 
drug,  injection  or  study  procedures)  in  men  (30)  than  in  women  (92)  with  30.0%  vs.  16.3%, 
respectively, the TEAE experience did not markedly differ between these subgroups. 
•  Age 
Age  subgroups  were  analysed  as  follows:  <45  years  (N=22),  ≥45  to  <55  years  (N=24),  ≥55  to  <65 
years (N=34), ≥65 to <75 years (N=31) and ≥75 years (N=11). 
There was a numerical trend towards slightly higher incidences of TEAEs in subjects older than 65 years. 
With regard to drug-, procedure-, or injection-related TEAEs, this trend was slightly reverse. 
All  age  subgroups  had  a  comparable  proportion  of  subjects  with  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  study  eye.  The 
proportions  of  subjects  with  ocular  TEAEs  in  the  fellow  eye  ranged  from  9.7%  in  the  age  group ≥65 to 
<75 years to 27.3% in both the youngest and the oldest age groups. 
As for all TEAEs, there was a trend toward higher incidences of non-ocular TEAEs with age. 
Extrinsinc factors 
No extrinsic factors were analyzed in the MYRROR study. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
No information was available regarding the safety of VTE in breast-feeding women, or in pregnant women 
and their foetuses. No pregnancies were reported during the entire course of the MYRROR study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been performed in the mCNV clinical development program. 
Patients investigated in MYRROR received treatment for a variety of diseases common to this study 
population including diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, glaucoma, renal disease, pulmonary 
disease, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 3 subjects (3%) discontinued study drug treatment due to TEAEs before Week 24. Of these, 2 
subjects  were  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  (idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura  and  cerebral  haemorrhage) 
and 1 subject in the Sham group (impetigo contagiosa). By Week 48, a total of 5 subjects (4%) including 
4 in the VTE 2 mg group and 1 in the Sham+VTE group, had discontinued treatment because of TEAEs. 
Additional cases between Week 24 and Week 48 (both in the VTE 2 mg group) included one case each of 
mild CNV in the fellow eye, and of mild abnormal hepatic function.

Integrated analysis of clinical trials data 
For  the  determination  of  ADRs  and  related  frequency  assessment,  the  MAH  provided  an  integrated 
analysis using data from pivotal clinical trials with VTE as follows: 
•  AMD: VIEW 1 (100 weeks of treatment) and VIEW 2 (96 weeks of treatment) 
•  CRVO: COPERNICUS (100 weeks of treatment) and GALILEO (76 weeks of treatment) 
•  DME: VISTA DME and VIVID DME (52 weeks of treatment in each study) 
•  BRVO: VIBRANT (52 weeks of treatment) 
•  Myopic CNV: MYRROR (48 weeks of treatment). 
In the pooled dataset, a total of 3073 patients had been exposed to VTE. The following table summarises 
relevant TEAEs and their incidence estimated from the integrated analysis.

Post marketing experience 
Eylea  has  been  commercially  available  in  the  United  States  since  November  2011  and  in  the  European 
Union since November 2012, and in a number of other countries from 2012 onwards.  
Based  upon  sales  information  through  31  December  2013,  the  number  of  vials  sold  worldwide  was 
estimated to be 1,709,923. Each vial sold was considered to represent a single drug administration. 
A  total  of  1382  spontaneous  ADRs  have  been  reported  starting  on  the  date  of  product  availability  in 
countries  where  Eylea  has  been  commercially  available  until  31  January  2014.  Of 
these 
1382 spontaneous case reports, 1166 were medically confirmed reports by health care professionals and 
216 were not medically confirmed. Out of the 1166 medically confirmed case reports, a total of 816 cases 
were serious. A total of 2482 AEs were reported (one case report may include more than one AE). 
The  MedDRA  SOC  with  the  greatest  number  of  both  serious  and  non-serious  ADRs  was  Eye  Disorder 
system  (1382  events,  or  approximately  55.7%  of  all  AEs  reported);  followed  by  General  Disorders  and 
Administration Conditions (225 events, 9.1%), and Infections and Infestations (215 events, 8.7%). 
When looking at serious AEs only, eye disorders accounted for 58.8% of reported serious AEs followed by 
Infections and Infestations (15.1%) and Nervous System disorders (7.7%). 
At  the  time  of  the  receipt  of  this  application  the  PSUR  covering  the  period  from  1  June  2014  to 
30 November  2014  was  under  assessment  by  the  Pharmacovigilance  Risk  Assessment  Committee  (PRAC). 
At the time of this report, the assessment was concluded and the PRAC was of the view that the overall 
benefit-risk  balance  of  Eylea  in  the  approved  indications  (AMD,  CRVO  DME,  BRVO)  remained  positive. 
Cumulative  data  up  to  30  November  2014  for  relevant  events  occurring  in  mCNV  patients  included 
8 ADRs  of  macular  hole  from  post-marketing  sources  and  5  from  company  sponsored  clinical  trials,  and 
9 serious  post-marketing  cases  of  cerebral  haemorrhage,  which  represents  the  third  most  frequent 
reported PT among non-ocular haemorrhage cases. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  clinical  safety  of  Eylea  in  the  treatment  of  visual  impairment  in  adult  mCNV  patients  was  mainly 
supported  by  data  collected  over  a  period  of  48  weeks  in  the  pivotal  phase  III  MYRROR  study.  Within 
MYRROR,  for  a  comparative  analysis  of  the  safety  data  between  groups,  the  24  week  period  was  of 
greater  value  as  by  this  point  in  time,  patients  in  the  Sham+VTE  group  had  not  yet  received  their  first 
active  injection.  Additional  data  supporting  the  safety  of  Eylea  IVT  treatment  was  available  from  the 
clinical development program in AMD, RVO and DME as well as from post-marketing experience. 
The CHMP noted that the total number of mCNV patients studied in MYRROR was rather limited (n=122), 
especially for the control (Sham) arm (n=31). According to international guidelines (ICH E1), a minimum 
of 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year period is considered acceptable. The sample size was 
further reduced by about 20% of non-completers by the end of the study, precluding the identification of 
rare  events.  Furthermore,  no  safety  data  were  generated  in  mCNV  patients  after  the  first  year  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 58/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
treatment  with  VTE  (last  Visit  in  MYRROR  at  Week  48).  Thus,  no  definite  conclusion  could  be  drawn  on 
the safety of VTE long-term treatment, and therefore the CHMP requested that mCNV patients should be 
included in the PASS program. The risk management plan (RMP) was updated accordingly. 
The  MYRROR  study  only  generated data in  the  East-Asian  populations.  However,  based on  the  available 
evidence at the time of this report, including the results of a systematic review of ethnic (in-)sensitivity of 
Eylea  treatment  in  Asian  versus  non-Asian  patients,  there  was  no  basis  to  assume  that  intrinsinc  or 
extrinsinc factors would cause differences in safety between ethnic subgroups. Thus, the CHMP was of the 
view  that  the  safety  data  from  MYRROR  could  be  extrapolated  to  European  patients.  Nevertheless,  the 
fact that only Asian people were studied should be reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
The majority of patients in both treatment groups experienced AEs and TEAEs. The proportion of subjects 
with  any  TEAEs  up  to  Week  48  was  67.2%.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  lower  in  the  Sham+VTE  group 
(58.1%)  than  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  (70.3%).  This  difference  between  treatment  groups  was  mainly 
driven  by  non-ocular  TEAEs.  However,  some  baseline  imbalances  in  terms of  medical  history  findings to 
the  disadvantage  of  the  VTE  2  mg  group,  such  as  hypertension,  and  the  relatively  small  size  of  the 
Sham+VTE  2  mg  group  have  to  be  considered  in  the  safety  assessment  and  interpretation  of  AE 
frequencies.  
Injection  related  TEAEs  were  reported  slightly  more  frequently  in  the  VTE 2 mg  group  than  in  the 
Sham+VTE  group,  and  procedure  related  TEAEs  occurred  exclusively  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group.  Similar 
observations were made at Week 24 and 48. Overall, the CHMP considered that a presentation of TEAEs 
by  number  of  previous  active  injections  and  by  time  to  onset  from  first  and  last  injection  would  have 
allowed for a more accurate analysis of the possible impact of the injections on TEAEs occurrence. Such 
presentation should be included in the next PSUR. 
Ocular TEAEs were reported in both treatment groups to a similar extent, and, as expected, the incidence 
was higher in the study eye than the fellow eye. In both treatment groups, ocular TEAEs in the study eye 
were about twice as often considered by the investigator related to the injection procedure than the study 
drug. Ocular TEAEs in the study eye were all mild or moderate in intensity, except one severe and serious 
case  of  macular  hole,  which  was  considered  by  the  study  investigator  related  to  study  drug,  to  the 
procedure  as  well  as  to  the  injection.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  high  myopia  is  a  risk  factor  for 
macular hole, which could also have caused the event. However, a causal relationship to the use of Eylea 
could not be entirely excluded in this case due to the temporal relationship, whereby the event occurred 
one month after Eylea injection. Based on this single report of macular hole, however, no firm conclusions 
could be drawn. Therefore, the CHMP considered that this AE should be further analysed in the next PSUR 
based on a cumulative review of the available data to decide if section 4.8 of the SmPC, serious adverse 
reactions related to the injection procedure, should be updated.  
Other reported ocular events in MYRROR were expected, particularly those considered ADRs (conjunctival 
haemorrhage,  eye  pain,  punctate  keratitis,  corneal  erosion,  ocular  hyperaemia,  cataract  subcapsular, 
retinal  tear,  vitreous  floaters),  based  on  the  known  safety  profile  of  Eylea.  Except  for  punctate  keratitis 
(common in the SmPC versus very common in the MYRROR study), the ADR frequencies observed in the 
study  were  generally  in  accordance  with  the  SmPC.  Based  on  an  integrated  analyses  of  the  available 
clinical  data  from  all  indications  at  the  time  of  this  report,  the  CHMP  furthermore  agreed  that  ADR 
frequencies  in  SmPC  section  4.8  and  package  leaflet  (PL)  section  4  should  be  updated  from  common  to 
uncommon  for  cataract  cortical  and  corneal  oedema  and  from  uncommon  to  rare  for  blindness  and 
uveitis.  
With regard to non-ocular TEAEs, the highest incidences were seen for the MedDRA SOCs ‘infections and 
infestations’ (nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection), ‘gastrointestinal disorders’ (nausea) and 
‘nervous system disorders’ (headache). These non-ocular TEAEs did not raise a safety concern. However, 
the serious case of cerebral haemorrhage, while not considered related to study drug, triggered a request 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 59/72 
 
  
  
by the CHMP  for close monitoring of this AE in next PSURs. The SmPC of  Eylea already included a class 
warning regarding an increased risk of bleeding events possibly related to systemic VEGF inhibition.  
The CHMP furthermore noted 2 cases of hypertension that occurred in in the VTE 2 mg group and  were 
considered related to study drug by the investigator. As hypertension is an important potential risk in the 
RMP  of  Eylea,  and  may  be  caused  by  systemic  VEGF  inhibition,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this  event 
should continue to be closely monitored in the next PSURs. 
Finally, as done for other  indications, the MAH updated the safety information in SmPC section 4.8 with 
the incidence of arterial thromboembolic events in mCNV patients, which was agreed by the CHMP.  
The  results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  appeared  broadly  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  entire  study 
population, however, the sample sizes were mostly too small to allow robust conclusions. The numerical 
trend  towards  slightly  higher  incidences  of  TEAEs  in  subjects  older  than  65 years  was  not  considered 
clinically meaningful. 
Overall, the safety data from the MYRROR study did not give rise for new safety concerns with VTE in the 
treatment of  mCNV  compared  to  the  existing  indications.  In  terms  of  exposure,  as  previously  discussed 
(see section 2.4.3. ), mCNV patients would be expected to receive fewer injections of Eylea compared to 
other target populations.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available safety data at the time of this report, the CHMP considered that the safety profile 
of Eylea in mCNV subjects was generally consistent with the known safety profile in other, approved 
target populations. The product information (PI) was updated in line with the data from MYRORR as well 
as an integrated analysis of all available clinical safety data. In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that 
the avilable data were sufficient to support the safety of Eylea in the treatment of adult patients with 
visual impairment due to mCNV. 
Nevertheless, due to the lack of safety data for long-term treatment beyond 1 year, the CHMP considered 
that mCNV patients should be included in the ongoing PASS program. 
In addition, the MAH should closely monitor reports of AEs of cerebral haemorrhage and hypertension and 
submit with the next PSUR a cumulative review of cases of macular hole in order to discuss addition of 
this AE in section 4.8 of the SmPC among serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure. 
Furthermore, a presentation of AEs by number of previous active injections and by time to onset from 
first and last injections should be provided with the next PSUR. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next PSUR should be submitted in accordance with the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, the warning on populations with limited data has been updated to include non-
Asian and non-treatment naïve mCNV patients as well as mCNV patients with extrafoveal lesions. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
The main changes to sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC are shown below (new text is shown in bold, 
deleted text as strike-through): 
SmPC section 4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Eylea is indicated for adults for the treatment of  
•  neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
• 
• 
visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (branch RVO or 
central RVO) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1)., 
•  visual impairment due to myopic choroidal neovascularisation (myopic CNV) (see 
section 5.1). 
SmPC section 4.2 
Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
(…) 
Myopic choroidal neovascularisation 
The recommended dose for Eylea is a single intravitreal injection of 2 mg aflibercept 
equivalent to 50 microlitres.  
Additional doses may be administered if visual and/or anatomic outcomes indicate that the 
disease persists. Recurrences should be treated as a new manifestation of the disease. 
The schedule for monitoring should be determined by the treating physician. 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month.

Populations with limited data 
(…) 
In myopic CNV there is no experience with Eylea in the treatment of non-Asian patients, 
patients who have previously undergone treatment for myopic CNV, and patients with 
extrafoveal lesions.  
The full PI including all changes is appended to this report. 
In addition, changes related to sections 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated to further condense 
the description of the pharmacodynamic effects and to amend the instructions for use including improved 
pictograms. Annex II was amended to ensure distribution of an updated physician information pack after 
introduction of the new indication, Some minor editorial and typographical amendments were also 
introduced throughout the SmPC and PL. 
Finally, it was noted by the CHMP that SmPC section 5.1 was rather extensive whereas the SmPC 
guideline recommends a concise summary of relevant evidence from studies supporting the indications. 
Therefore, the CHMP recommended that the MAH should submit a proposal to shorten SmPC section 5.1 
at the time of the next submission affecting the Annexes. The pharmacodynamic effects could be 
summarised with all indications in a single table. For efficacy, it should be considered if both tables and 
figures are necessary. In any event, the text should be reviewed, which should not be redundant with the 
tables. Footnotes should be limited to the essential.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to the Eylea PL version of the vial presentation adopted with a 
previous variation introducing BRVO as a new indication. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
CNV  secondary  to  PM  is  one  of  the  major  causes  of  visual  impairment  in  young  adults  worldwide.  The 
visual  prognosis  of  mCNV  patients  is  generally  poor  without  treatment.  Recent  findings  with  anti-VEGF 
agents have shown promising results in that IVT treatment not only helped prevent disease progression 
but also led to relevant vision recovery. 
The  benefits  of  Eylea  in  the  treatment  in  mCNV  were  investigated  in  a  single  phase  III  trial  (MYRROR) 
over a period of 12 months (6 month for the primary efficacy assessment) using Sham as comparator. In 
this  study,  an  initial  injection  of  2  mg  VTE  followed  by  additional  injections  based  on  pre-defined  re-
treatment  criteria  up  to  6  months  (24  weeks)  resulted  in  clinically  relevant  visual  improvements  with 
patients  receiving  active  treatment  being  able  to  read  on  average  14  letters  more  on  a  standard  vision 
Assessment report  
EMA/758988/2015 
Page 66/72 
 
  
  
 
chart  compared  to  the  Sham  group.  Furthermore,  while  35  out  of  the  90  patients  (38.9%)  in  the  VTE 
group responded to treatment with a vision gain of ≥ 15 letters, only 3 of the 31 patients (9.7%) in the 
Sham group were responders. VTE treatment also reduced CRT while it remained increased under Sham, 
with  difference  between  treatment  arms  of  80  μm  by  Week  24.  Overall,  all  visual  and  morphologic 
endpoints in the study showed a similar trend of superiority of VTE over Sham.  
The study furthermore showed that beneficial effects occurred early after treatment initiation and reached 
a  plateau  during  the  first  6 months.  Both  visual  and  anatomic  improvements  were  maintained  over  the 
course of the study until its end by Week 48.  
The  proposed  dosing  regimen  of  an  initial  dose  of  2  mg  VTE  IVT  followed  by  additional  injections  as 
needed, based on visual and/or anatomic outcomes, at intervals of no less than 4 weeks, was considered 
appropriate  by  the  CHMP  as  it  was  in  line  with  the  regimen  used  in  MYRROR.  Indeed,  the  clinical  data 
suggested that some patients may be controlled with a single injection. In the active treatment arm, 14% 
of  subjects  required  only  a  single  injection  in  the  48-week  study  period,  and  nearly  60%  required 
between 1 and 3 injections.  
Taken together, the data from MYRROR convincingly demonstrated a clinically relevant benefit within the 
study  population,  which  was  representative  of  a  severe  treatment-naïve  myopic  population  with  sub-  or 
juxtafoveal mCNV. The study was conducted in Asia and the vast majority of patients were Japanese. The 
selection  of  the  Asian  population  was  justified  by  the  MAH  by  a  higher  frequency  of  PM  in  Asians. 
Nevertheless,  the  prevalence  of  myopia  appears  to  be  increasing  in  Europe  and  the  CHMP  noted  that 
other recent studies with VEGF inhibitors included both Asian and non–Asian patients. In order to be able 
to  extrapolate  the  data  from  the  Asian  population  to  the  EU  population,  the  MAH  carried  out  a 
comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  ethnic  (in-)sensitivity  of  VTE  in  Asians  and  Caucasians  based  on  the 
available clinical data for Eylea in AMD, CRVO and DME. Overall, the analyses performed found no major 
difference  between  Asians  and  non-Asians  and  therefore  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  results  of  MYRROR 
could be considered representative for patients in Europe as well. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  MYRROR  study  did  neither  include  patients  with  extrafoveal  lesions,  nor  those  who  had  previously 
undergone treatment with Visudyne photo-dynamic therapy (vPDT) and thus had recurrent mCNV. These 
limitations  were  reflected  in  sections  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  as  was  the  fact  that  all  patients  were  of  Asian 
origin.  
The  majority  of  patients  were  recruited  into  the  study  less  than  2  months  after  diagnosis.  Such  early 
intervention is in line with the recommended management of mCNV to avoid irreversible degradation of 
vision  over  time.  This  was  also  shown  in  MYRORR,  where  patients  in  the  Sham+VTE  group,  who  had  a 
delayed in the start of active treatment, experienced less pronounced visual and anatomic improvements. 
Nevertheless, the data suggested a beneficial effect also with later onset of IVT VTE treatment. 
The CHMP furthermore noted that drug exposure and number of IVT injections might be considerably less 
in  mCNV  patients  compared  to  other  target  populations  of  Eylea.  In  contrast  to  AMD,  RVO  and  DME, 
patients  with  mCNV  may  only  require  a  single  injection  to  control  the  disease.  No  initial  fixed  monthly 
dosing is required. In order to better understand drug use including frequency of injections in European 
clinical  practice,  mCNV  patients  will  be  included  in  the  planned  observational  study,  which  will  evaluate 
drug  utilization  of  intravitreal  aflibercept  in  real-world  clinical  practice  including  injection  frequency  by 
indication. This was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Finally,  MYRROR  recruited  exclusively  Asian  patients  and  while,  overall,  the  evaluation  of  the  ethnical 
insensitivity  found  no  major  difference  between  Asians  and  non-Asians,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that 
the lack of data in non-Asian patients should be reflected in the SmPC. Inclusion of mCNV patients in the 
Assessment report

planned drug utilization study, while not primarily designed for efficacy, should also contribute to further 
document the effects of Eylea in Caucasians. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  data  from  the  pivotal  phase  III  study  MYRROR  suggested  that  the  safety  profile  of  Eylea  in  the 
treatment  of  mCNV  patients  was  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  previously  reported  in  other  target 
populations, i.e. AMD, DME, and RVO patients. The most common ocular ADRs reported were conjunctival 
haemorrhage,  punctate  keratitis  and  eye  pain,  which  were  already  known  adverse  reactions  listed  in 
SmPC  section  4.8  of  Eylea.  No  cases of  endophthalmitis  have  been  reported in  MYRROR.  Also  similar to 
previous  studies  with  Eylea  in  AMD,  DME  and  RVO,  the  most  common  non-ocular  TEAEs  were 
nasopharyngitis, nausea and headache.  
PK/PD  data  likewise  showed  no  marked  differences  in  systemic  exposure  between  patients  groups,  i.e. 
mCNV, AMD and CRVO. There was also no sign of immunogenicity. 
Concerning  arterial  thromboembolic  events,  no  case  was  reported  in  the  VTE  2  mg  group  in  MYRROR 
excepted  for  one  case  of  cerebral  haemorrhage,  but  this  event  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator 
related to study drug. The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events was reflected in SmPC section 4.8, 
in line with what has been done in the other indications. 
Based on an integrated analysis of the safety data across the clinical trials programs, the CHMP agreed to 
change the ADR frequency for cataract cortical and corneal oedema from common to uncommon and for 
blindness and uveitis from uncommon to rare. SmPC section 4.8 was updated accordingly. 
While  MYRROR  only  recruited  patients  from  Asia,  there  was  no  evidence  supporting  a  difference  in  the 
safety  profiles  in  Asian  and  non-Asian  subjects.  Thus,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  the  safety  data  could  be 
extrapolated  to  European  patients.  Nevertheless,  the  fact  that  only  Asian  people  were  studied  was 
reflected in SmPC section 4.8. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The number of patients with safety data in the new target population was rather limited with 122 patients 
including  91  patients  treated  with  Eylea.  This  limited  sample  size  precluded  detection  of  rare  adverse 
events.  Furthermore,  no  data  were  generated  for  long-term  treatment  beyond  1  year.  Therefore,  the 
CHMP  considered  that  additional  data  should  be  generated post-authorisation and  requested that  mCNV 
patients should be included in the ongoing PASS program in the RMP. 
While the vast majority of ocular adverse events in MYRROR was mild or moderate, there was one severe 
and  serious  case  of  macular  hole  with  a  temporal  relationship  to  the  administration  of  Eylea  injection. 
With  high  myopia  being  a  risk  factor  for  macular  hole,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  this  single  case 
report was not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions on causality. Therefore, a cumulative review should 
be  provided  with  the  next  PSUR.  Furthermore,  a  presentation  of  AEs  by  number  of  previous  active 
injections and by time to onset from first and last injections should be provided with the next PSUR. The 
CMHP  also  requested  close  monitoring  of  AEs  in  the  next  PSUR  based  on  one  case  of  cerebral 
haemorrhage  not  considered  related  to  study  drug  and  2  cases  of  hypertension  considered  related  to 
study drug, as these events could be linked to potential risks of systemic VEGF inhibition.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the management of mCNV, both recovery of vision and prevention of further vision loss are important 
treatment objectives. Similar to what has been described for other anti-VEGF agents, IVT treatment with 
Eylea  resulted  in  highly  convincing  findings  for  both  visual  and  anatomic  criteria  supporting  a  clinically 
meaningful treatment benefit for mCNV patients, which may be achieved already with a single injection in 
some  patients.  Both  the  average  gain  in  vision  as  well  as  the  rate  of  responders  clearly  favoured  Eylea 
over  Sham  and  the  findings  were  clinically  relevant  with  treatment  differences  of  14  letters  and  30% 
responders (BCVA gain ≥15 letters) between study arms.  
Adverse events were mainly ocular and mild to moderate in intensity. No new safety concern arose. The 
safety profile of Eylea in mCNV patients appeared to be generally in line with the known safety profile in 
other target populations.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefits  of  Eylea  in  the  treatment  of  mCNV  have  been  convincingly  demonstrated  based  on  visual 
and  anatomic  finding  showing  that  Eylea  can  prevent  disease  progression  and  help  regain  vision  to  a 
Assessment report

clinically meaningful degree. The safety profile remained largely unchanged and the CHMP concluded that 
the benefits of Eylea in the treatment of adult patients with visual impairment due to mCNV outweighed 
its risks. Thus, the benefit-risk balance was considered to be favourable.  
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
In light of the available reports for other VEGF inhibitors in mCNV, the efficacy findings for Eylea were not 
unexpected.  At  the  time  of  this  report,  anti-VEGF  agents  had  already  become  gold  standard  in  the 
treatment  of  mCNV,  with  ranibizumab  being  the  first  in  class  approved  in  this  indication  in  the  EU  in 
2013.  
Notably, the study population recruited in MYRROR was limited to Asians who were treatment-naïve and 
had subfoveal or juxtafoveal CNV. This was reflected in the SmPC. Furthermore, the safety database for 
mCNV  patients  was  rather  limited  and  no  data  for  long-term  treatment  beyond  1 year  were  available. 
Therefore, the CHMP required that mCNV patients be included in the ongoing PASS program for Eylea as 
per the RMP. Furthermore, the inclusion of mCNV patients in the planned observational study will help to 
gain data on drug use in European clinical practice including frequency of injections in the new indication 
compared to the existing ones. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the MAH should closely monitor reports of AEs of cerebral 
haemorrhage and hypertension and submit the following safety data with the next PSUR:

last injections. 
4.  Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change:

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated, including the 
warning on populations with limited data to inform healthcare professionals that no data were available 
for non-Asian and non-treatment naïve myopic CNV patients as well as patients with extrafoveal lesions. 
In addition, sections 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated to further condense the description of 
the pharmacodynamic effects and to clarify the instructions for use including improved pictograms. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Annex II was amended to indicate that an updated 
physician information pack should be distributed after introduction of the new indication. Minor editorial 
and typographical amendments were made throughout the product information.

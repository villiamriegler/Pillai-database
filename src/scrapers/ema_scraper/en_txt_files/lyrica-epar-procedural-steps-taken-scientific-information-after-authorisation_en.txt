The results from the pregnancy outcomes study provided

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Submission of an updated RMP (version 13.2) to 
include results from recently completed PASS 
studies, namely: 1) study A0081359: a population-
based cohort study of pregabalin to characterize 
pregnancy outcomes; 2) study A0081106: a 12-
month open-label study to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy in 
paediatric subjects 1 month to 16 years of age with 
partial onset seizures and paediatric and adult 
subjects 5 to 65 years of age with primary 
additional information concerning the risks of pregabalin 
treatment during pregnancy; supporting that pregabalin 
should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly 
necessary and women of childbearing potential have to use 
effective contraception based on the new data on major 
congenital malformations. In addition, the data support 
that pregabalin may cross the human placenta.

Product Characteristics.

A0081042: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicentre study of the efficacy and 
safety of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy in children 
1 month through <4 years of age with partial onset 
seizures; 4) study A0081105: a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre 
trial of pregabalin as adjunctive therapy in paediatric 
and adult subjects with primary generalized tonic-
clonic seizures. In addition, information on 
A0081096: a prospective randomized 12-week 
controlled study of visual field change in subjects 
with partial seizures receiving pregabalin or placebo 
has been updated as well as A0081365: a phase 4, 
randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- 
and active-controlled, single-dose, six-way crossover 
study to evaluate the potential for abuse with 
pregabalin. However, further issues noted with the 
RMP should be updated at the next regulatory 
opportunity. 
In the light of the results from the pregnancy 
outcomes study, section 4.6 of the SmPC is being 
updated concerning the risks of pregabalin treatment 
during pregnancy, indicating that women of 
childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception, pregabalin may cross the human 
placenta and the description of major congenital 
malformations (MCM). In addition, section 4.4 is 
updated to highlight that pregabalin should not be 
used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and 
women of childbearing potential have to use effective 
contraception based on the new data on MCM.

least a 50% reduction in partial onset seizures as compared 
to baseline was 40.6% of subjects treated with pregabalin 
10 mg/kg/day (p=0.0068 versus placebo), 29.1% of 
subjects treated with pregabalin 2.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.2600

and behaviour in association with the use of antiepileptics, 
available data from randomized placebo controlled trials 
and from the post-marketing phase for this class of 
medicines was considered by the CHMP. 
Overall, despite the small number of events seen in the 
clinical trials and the lack of a statistically significant 
increased risk of suicidal behaviour, the analysis of 
randomized placebo controlled trials of antiepileptic drugs 
did not exclude the possibility of an increased risk. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered it necessary to update 
section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the PL with 
information regarding suicidal ideation and behaviour.

urinary retention and the Stevens Johnson syndrome were

cardiovascular and respiratory disorders remains a concern 
and the warning in section 4.4 of congestive heart failure 
should be strengthened. The MAH therefore submitted on 
10 September 2007 the present variation which includes 
amendements to the sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC with

retention respectively. The relevant section of the Package

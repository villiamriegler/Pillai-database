Brief description of the product
Chemical class:  Humanized monoclonal antibody of the 
immunoglobulin (IgG) 1 subclass
Summary of mode of action:  Risankizumab selectively 
binds with high affinity (< 29 pM) to the p19 subunit of 
human IL-23 cytokine and inhibits its interaction with 
the IL-23 receptor.
Important information about its composition:  The 
active substance, risankizumab, is produced in a 
mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] 
cells) using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
technology.  The product is currently supplied as a 
solution in pre-filled pen, pre-filled syringe, or pre-filled 
cartridge for subcutaneous injection.  Each 150 mg 
pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe contains 1 mL 
solution (150 mg/mL formulation).  Each 75 mg pre-
filled syringe contains 0.83 mL solution (90 mg/mL 
formulation).  The 150 mg strength will eventually 
replace the 75 mg strength in the marketplace.  For 
CD, each 600 mg liquid vial contains 10.0 mL solution 
(60 mg/mL formulation).  The intravenous (IV) 
formulation is qualitatively the same as the 150 mg/mL 
10
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
formulation.  In addition to a different route of 
administration, the 600 mg liquid vial is quantitatively 
different, as the concentration of the active ingredient 
in the IV presentation is 60 mg/mL, which is different 
from that of both SC PFS presentations described 
above.  The 2.4 mL (360 mg) of the 150 mg/mL 
formulation is administered by SC injection using an 
OBI with a cartridge.

Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target 
Population(s)
Indication:  Plaque Psoriasis
Incidence:  The incidence of psoriasis (per 100,000 person-years) in adults ranged from 129 to 
172 in the United Kingdom (UK) (Springate 2017), from 104 to 181 in Denmark (Egeberg 
2017), and from 230 to 321 in Italy (Vena 2010).  In the United States (US), the incidence of 
psoriasis in women was approximately 91 per 100,000 person-years (Kumar 2013).
Prevalence:  In Europe, the prevalence of psoriasis ranged from 1.21% (Croatia) to 11.43% 
(Norway) in adults (World Health Organization 2016).  The proportion of adults with moderate 
to severe psoriasis was 2.9% in the UK (Gelfand 2007), 12.1% in Sweden (Svedbom 2015), 
and 15.3% in Denmark (Egeberg 2017).  In the US, approximately 6.7 million adults (3.1%) 
aged 20+ years have psoriasis (Helmick 2014).  In patients with plaque psoriasis, 
approximately 80% have mild to moderate disease and 20% have moderate to severe disease 
(Menter 2008).  It appears that the prevalence of psoriasis is highest in Northern Europe and 
lowest in East Asia (Gupta 2014).  There appears to be an increasing prevalence of psoriasis in 
Norway (Danielsen 2013).
Demographics of the target population:  Psoriasis incidence and prevalence are similar in both 
sexes (Helmick 2014, Kurd 2009).  Psoriasis prevalence peaks in patients aged 30 to 60 years 
of age (Ferrándiz 2001, Helmick 2014).  In the US, psoriasis prevalence is higher in people 
categorized as Caucasian/non-Hispanic white compared with people categorized as African-
American/non-Hispanic black or Hispanic/other (Gelfand 2005, Helmick 2014).
Risk Factors:  High body mass index (BMI), exposure to tobacco smoke at home, and stressful 
life events may be risk factors for paediatric psoriasis, and alcohol consumption and smoking 
may be risk factors for adult psoriasis (Brenaut 2013, Li 2012, Ozden 2011).  Genetic 
predisposition (e.g., human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-Cw*06) and high latitude are also 
important risk factors (Springate 2017, Wu 2011).
The main treatment options:  Treatment depends on the extent of disease.  The traditional 
treatment paradigm in managing psoriasis patients is that those with limited disease are 
treated with topical agents such as corticosteroids, calcipotriene, or dithranol.  In moderate to 
severe cases, or where topical therapy has proven ineffective, phototherapy or systemic 
treatment are available options.  Exposure to ultraviolet B phototherapy may be effective but is 
12
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
often inconvenient due to the frequency of treatments, which are usually administered in a 
physician's office.  Exposure to psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy is also effective but has been 
associated with the development of melanoma and of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  
Chronic therapy with traditional systemic treatments for moderate and severe psoriasis, 
including oral retinoids, methotrexate, fumaric acid esters, and cyclosporine, can be limited by 
lack of efficacy or precluded by dose dependent side effects.  Oral retinoids can cause 
hypertriglyceridemia and hepatitis; methotrexate can cause bone marrow suppression, 
pneumonitis, and cirrhosis; cyclosporine can cause hypertension (HTN) and renal toxicity; and 
fumaric acid esters can cause gastrointestinal toxicity and flush.  Due to the toxicity of 
systemic agents, these medications are generally administered in rotation to avoid long-term 
or cumulative toxicities (Menter 2008, Menter 2010, Menter 2009a, Menter 2009b).
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) antagonists, including adalimumab, etanercept, and 
infliximab, are also used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  Other approved and/or 
recommended drugs for psoriasis include an interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 inhibitor 
ustekinumab, IL-17A inhibitors (secukinumab and ixekizumab), an IL-17 receptor A antagonist 
(brodalumab), IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab and tildrakizumab), and a phosphodiesterase 4 
inhibitor apremilast (Food and Drug Administration 2017, Nast 2015).
While anti-TNFs have long provided an important therapeutic option for patients with moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis, and newer entrants such as IL-17 and IL-12/23 inhibitors have 
added incremental clinical benefit, marked reduction in the extent and severity of disease, 
there remains an unmet medical need for adult patients with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis (Kragballe 2014).  Patients can relapse because of nonadherence or treatment 
discontinuation due to safety risks, or inadequate treatment of symptoms such as pain or 
itching, leaving many patients with moderate to severe psoriasis undertreated.  Plaque 
psoriasis is a chronic life-long disease, and patients require multiple therapeutic options 
including medications that are more convenient (or have longer dosing interval), and are safe 
and more effective (Boehncke 2017, Feldman 2016, Lambert 2018).
Natural history of psoriasis in the population, including mortality and morbidity: Plaque 
psoriasis is usually chronic with intermittent remissions.  In addition to cutaneous involvement, 
plaque psoriasis may be associated with arthritis and extra-articular manifestations such as 
ocular manifestations (conjunctivitis, corneal lesions and uveitis) (Basko-Plluska 2012).  
Mortality in psoriasis patients ranges from 11.9 to 26.0 per 1000 patient-years (PYs) 
(Abuabara 2010, Gelfand 2007, Lee 2017, Masson 2017, Ogdie 2014, Stern 2011, Svedbom 
2015).  Compared with patients without psoriasis, severe psoriasis was associated with 
increased all-cause mortality, with hazard ratio ranging from 1.5 to 1.8, whereas mild psoriasis 
was found to have variable association with all-cause mortality (Gelfand 2007, Ogdie 2014, 
Svedbom 2015).

Indication:  Psoriatic Arthritis
Incidence:  The pooled psoriatic arthritis incidence from nine population-based studies 
conducted in Europe, the US, and Argentina was 8.3 per 100,000 PY (Scotti 2018).  In Europe, 
the incidence of psoriatic arthritis per 100,000 PY has ranged from 3.0 in Greece to 41.3 in 
Norway (Hoff 2015, Scotti 2018).  The incidence per 100,000 PY in other European countries 
was 3.6 in the Czech Republic (Hanova 2010), 8.0 in Sweden, 23.1 in Finland (Scotti 2018), 
and 7.3 to 27.3 in Denmark (Egeberg 2017).
The incidence of psoriatic arthritis has been reported to increase over the last decades with 
some geographic differences.  In the US, the incidence rates increased from 3.6 per 
100,000 PY between 1970 - 79, to 6.6 per 100,000 PY between 1982 - 91, to 9.8 per 
100,000 PY between 1990 - 2000 (Shbeeb 2000, Wilson 2009).  In Denmark, the incidence 
estimate increased from 7.3 to 27.3 per 100,000 PY from 1997 to 2010 (Egeberg 2017).  In 
other geographic areas, the incidence of psoriatic arthritis remained stable (Eder 2018).
The incidence of psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis is higher than in the general 
population (Solmaz 2018).  Across observational and clinical studies, the incidence of psoriatic 
arthritis among patients with psoriasis ranged from 270 per 100,000 PY in the US and UK, to 
2,700 per 100,000 PY in Canada (Alinaghi 2019), and up to 7,400 per 100,000 PY in Europe 
(Christophers 2010).
Prevalence:  The pooled psoriatic arthritis prevalence from 26 population-based studies 
conducted in different countries around the world was 133 per 100,000 population (Scotti 
2018).  By geographic areas, the highest prevalence was reported in Asia (200 per 
100,000 population), followed by Northern Europe (172 per 100,000 population), North 
America (138 per 100,000 population), South America (122 per 100,000 population), and 
Southern Europe (99 per 100,000 population).  The prevalence per 100,000 population in 
European countries ranged from 20 in Sweden to 670 in Norway (Scotti 2018).  Prevalence 
estimates in the US have ranged from 0.06% to 0.25% (Ogdie 2015).
Approximately 1 in 4 patients with psoriasis has psoriatic arthritis (Alinaghi 2019).  Across 266 
observational and clinical studies, the pooled prevalence of psoriatic arthritis among patients 
with psoriasis (all ages) was 19.7%; the psoriatic arthritis prevalence was 22.7% in European 
patients with psoriasis and 19.5% in North American patients with psoriasis (Alinaghi 2019).  
Among patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, the pooled prevalence of psoriatic arthritis 
was 24.6%.
Demographics of the target population:  Psoriatic arthritis has a mean age of onset occurring in 
the fourth decade of life and affects men and women approximately equally (Koolaee 2013), 
with prevalence estimates of 150 in men and 133 in women per 100,000 population, 
respectively (Scotti 2018).  The prevalence of psoriatic arthritis in African American patients 
has been found to be lower than in Caucasians (30% versus 65%, respectively) (Kerr 2015).

Risk Factors:  Potential nonmodifiable risk factors for psoriatic arthritis include a family history 
of/genetic predisposition for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis-related factors (age of onset, 
severity, nail dystrophy/lesions, psoriasis lesions located on the scalp or intergluteal/perianal 
regions) (Ogdie 2015, Solmaz 2018).
The main treatment options:  Psoriatic arthritis patients require treatment of the entire 
spectrum of disease manifestations.  The primary goal of treating patients with psoriatic 
arthritis is to maximize long-term health-related quality of life through control of symptoms, 
prevention of structural damage, normalization of function and social participation, and 
abrogation of inflammation.
Specific recommendations differ slightly between European League Against Rheumatism 
(EULAR), Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), and 
American College of Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation (ACR/NAPF) organizations; 
however, recommendations for therapeutic choice are made based on a patient's clinical 
presentation as some manifestations of psoriatic arthritis, such as skin, enthesitis, dactylitis, 
and axial disease respond differently to specific therapies.  Initial treatment of musculoskeletal 
symptoms is composed of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local 
corticosteroid injections, while topical therapies are used for the initial treatment of psoriasis.  
For psoriatic arthritis patients who experience toxicity or lack of efficacy with these measures, 
both the EULAR (Gossec 2020) and GRAPPA (Coates 2016) recommend systemic therapy with 
conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (methotrexate, 
leflunomide, or sulfasalazine), followed by biologic therapy (TNF, IL-17, or IL-12/23 inhibitors) 
in patients who do not respond adequately to csDMARDs.  EULAR recommends continuing 
methotrexate with a biologic in patients already taking and tolerating this drug; however, the 
csDMARDs have limited efficacy and specific risks (e.g., aplastic anemia and hepatotoxicity 
including liver failure).  The ACR/NAPF recommends anti-TNFs primarily as initial treatments 
(Singh 2019).  Primary or secondary non-response or intolerance to adverse effects of these 
available therapies; however, leaves many patients with an unmet medical need.  The 
development of other target-specific biologic therapies (e.g., IL-23 inhibitors) or targeted 
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (such as Janus kinase [JAK] 
inhibitors) have provided additional therapy options for psoriatic arthritis patients.
The primary goal of treating patients with psoriatic arthritis is to maximize long-term health-
related quality of life, and treatment should be aimed at reaching the target of remission or, 
alternatively, low disease activity, by regular disease activity assessment and appropriate 
adjustment of therapy (Gossec 2020).  However, across randomized clinical trials with different 
advanced therapies, the achievement of a minimal disease activity state (MDA), or remission of 
disease only occurs in a minority of patients.  In addition, shared decision making between the 
patient and the health care provider, considering efficacy, safety and costs, is consistently 
recommended across EULAR, GRAPPA and American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/National 
Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) organizations.  Therefore, there is a need for additional therapeutic 
16
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
options in psoriatic arthritis that improve outcomes across multiple manifestations, are well 
tolerated, and provide convenient administration (including monitoring).
Despite the beneficial results achieved with currently available biologic agents, approximately 
40% of patients who receive a biologic do not have at least a 20% improvement in ACR scores 
(ACR20) (Cosentyx 2016, Stelara 2014, Enbrel 2015, Remicade 2015, Humira 2019, 
Cimzia 2016, and Simponi 2016 package inserts).  Importantly, all currently available drugs 
fail to induce a state of remission or minimal disease activity in the majority of psoriatic 
arthritis patients and do not adequately treat all disease manifestations.  Thus, there remains a 
clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in psoriatic arthritis for patients with 
inadequate response to or intolerance to currently available therapies.
Natural history of the indicated disease/condition in the population, including mortality and 
morbidity:  Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease classified as a 
sub-type of spondyloarthritis and characterized by the association of arthritis and psoriasis.  
Psoriatic arthritis can develop at any time, but for most people it appears between the ages of 
30 and 50, and it affects men and women equally.  The course of psoriatic arthritis is usually 
characterized by flares and remissions.  Left untreated, patients with psoriatic arthritis can 
have persistent inflammation, progressive joint damage, disability, and a reduced life 
expectancy (Duarte 2012, Gladman 2011).  In the majority of patients (60% – 70%), the 
diagnosis of psoriasis precedes psoriatic arthritis (Kerschbaumer 2016).  In 15% – 20%, 
arthritis precedes the onset of psoriasis, and in 15% - 20% of patients, both musculoskeletal 
and skin manifestations occur within a period of 1 year (Kerschbaumer 2016).
Patients with psoriatic arthritis experience varying combinations of disease manifestations 
affecting the synovium, tendons, entheses, skin, and bone.  These manifestations of disease 
range in prevalence with peripheral arthritis (mono-, oligo-, or polyarticular) and variable 
degrees of psoriasis observed in all patients at some point during their disease course, axial 
disease in 25 – 70% depending on the criteria used for diagnosis (Feld 2018), enthesitis in up 
to 72%, dactylitis in up to 59%, nail involvement in up to 92% (Pittam 2020), and anterior 
uveitis in 2 - 25% (Cantini 2015).  Additionally, psoriatic arthritis patients are more likely than 
healthy subjects to experience the comorbid conditions of cardiovascular disease, metabolic 
syndrome, obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), kidney 
disease, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, depression, and anxiety, and have decreased quality of life 
and functional impairment (Husni 2015, Lee 2010, Magrey 2013).
Some patients with psoriatic arthritis demonstrate a mild, minimally, or non-progressive 
disease that requires only symptomatic treatment, including arthralgia, low-grade inflammation 
or oligoarthritis.  The majority of patients with psoriatic arthritis will develop a progressive 
deforming arthritis with osteolysis of the digits and polyarticular involvement (Helliwell 2015).  
Patients become progressively more disabled as damaged joints are gradually accrued.  
Patients can develop joint deformity in their hands and feet.  Markers of disease progression 
17
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
include erosive disease in the peripheral joints, and new symptoms or worsening of psoriatic 
arthritis symptoms.
Among patients with rheumatologist-verified psoriatic arthritis in a population-based study in 
Denmark, 53% had mild psoriatic arthritis, 33% had moderate psoriatic arthritis, and 14% had 
severe psoriatic arthritis (Tekin 2019).  Patients with relatively mild disease tend not to 
develop significant disability; however, in patients with moderate to severe disease, psoriatic 
arthritis significantly impacts patients' function and quality of life.  The additional burden of 
psoriatic skin disease compounds rates of disability and impaired quality of life.  Patients in 
specialty care experience increased morbidity and mortality, most often attributable to 
cardiovascular disease (Helliwell 2015).
Important co-morbidities:  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) (including HTN, hyperlipidaemia, 
ischaemic heart disease, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral 
vascular disease), atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, obesity, liver 
disease, osteoporosis, IBD, uveitis, and psychological disorders (including depression and 
anxiety) (Haddad 2017, Husted 2013, Kaine 2019, Kimhi 2007, Makredes 2009, Shah 2017).

Indication:  Crohn's Disease
Incidence:  The incidence of CD worldwide has increased over the last three decades, 
particularly in newly industrialized countries.  CD incidence is highest in North America and 
Europe, with estimates of 23.8 and approximately 10 to 15 per 100,000 person-years in North 
America and Europe, respectively (Ng 2017).  In Asia and the Middle East, the incidence of CD 
is estimated to be up to 8.4 per 100,000 person-years (Ng 2017).  The incidence of pediatric-
onset CD is highest in North America (13.9 per 100,000 person-years) and in Europe (12.3 per 
100,000 person-years) (Sykora 2018).  The incidence of CD in children and adolescents has 
increased over time (Ghione 2018, Larsen 2016).  Among French adolescents aged 10-
16 years, the age-adjusted incidence rate of CD (per 100,000 person-years) has increased 
from 4.2 in 1988 to 9.5 in 2011(Ghione 2018).
Prevalence:  The burden of CD remains substantial with the highest prevalence estimates in 
Europe (322 per 100,000 persons in Germany) and North America (319 per 100,000).  In Asia 
and the Middle East, prevalence may be as high as 53.1 per 100,000 (Ng 2017).
Among US children aged 2 to 17 years, the standardized prevalence of CD (per 100,000) 
increased from 18.5 in 2007 to 45.9 in 2016; this increase was mainly driven by a surge of CD 
cases among adolescents (ages 10-17 years) (Ye 2019).
Studies conducted in various geographic regions have found an increasing trend in the 
prevalence of CD over time (Benchimol 2014, Ye 2019, Yen 2019).
Demographics of the target population:  The disease can affect persons of any age, and its 
onset is most common in the second and third decades.  Females are affected slightly more 
than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups (Loftus 2004).
Risk Factors:  Crohn's disease is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder with genetic, 
immunologic, and environmental influences.  The etiology of the condition remains unknown.  
Genome wide association studies have identified over 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
that contribute to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) susceptibility.  However, the association 
between these polymorphisms and disease development is relatively weak compared with twin 
19
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
studies and family history which suggest a stronger coefficient of heritability (Gordon 2015, Ye 
2016).  Environmental risk factors such as smoking, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
oral contraceptives may increase the risk of developing Crohn's disease – however the overall 
risk of disease onset from these factors appears to be low (Ananthakrishnan 2012, Cornish 
2008, Somerville 1984, To 2016).
The main treatment options:  The long-term goal of CD treatment is to achieve clinical 
remission and endoscopic healing (Turner 2021).  Oral 5-ASAs have not shown efficacy and are 
not recommended for moderate to severe CD.  Corticosteroids are effective for induction of CD 
remission, but they are ineffective in maintaining remission and must be used sparingly given 
their significant short-term and long-term complications.  Maintenance therapy with thiopurines 
or methotrexate may be considered, however clinical response may not be evident for up to 
12 weeks and risks include lymphoma and hepatotoxicity (Kotlyar 2015, Lemann 2000).  In 
moderate to severe CD, especially for patients with poor prognostic factors, the early use of 
TNF inhibitors may be considered.  Infliximab and adalimumab have been approved in the 
European Union (EU).  Over the past decade there is an emerging need for therapies that treat 
patients who do not respond to TNF inhibitors and ACG guidelines suggest that if patients do 
not respond to a TNF inhibitor within 2-4 weeks of initiation, drugs from another class should 
be used.
Since 2014, the EU has approved vedolizumab and ustekinumab for the treatment of patients 
with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease who have had an inadequate response or 
intolerance to either conventional therapy or a tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) antagonist.
● Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the 
α4β7 integrin and blocks its interaction with mucosal addressin cell adhesion 
molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1).  In two induction trials, clinical remission (defined as 
Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] ≤150) at Week 6 was achieved in 15% of 
vedolizumab subjects vs 7% of placebo subjects, which was statistically significant.  
In the second induction study, 19% of vedolizumab subjects and 12% of placebo 
subjects achieved clinical remission at Week 6, which was not statistically 
significant.  These results highlight the efficacy of vedolizumab, but also the 
continued need for additional treatment options for patients with Crohn's disease 
who may not respond to existing treatments.
● Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody to the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23.  In 
two induction trials (UNITI-1 and UNITI-2), 1300 patients with Crohn disease and 
nonresponse to anti-TNF therapy were assigned to intravenous (IV) ustekinumab 
(either 130 mg or 6 mg/kilogram) or placebo for eight weeks.  In both trials, 
patients treated with ustekinumab had higher clinical response rates at Week 6 
compared with placebo.  The studies demonstrate the efficacy of ustekinumab in 
the induction of clinical response in CD.  However, the studies also demonstrate 
20
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
that a significant unmet need continues to exist for moderate to severe Crohn's 
disease patients who are nonresponders to existing biologic treatments.
While results from approved biologics represent progress in the treatment of CD, clinical 
remission rates for moderate to severe CD remain limited.  Traditionally, the goals of 
treatment of CD centered solely on symptom control; however, it is now recognized that 
mucosal healing represents an important long term treatment goal, as it has been shown to be 
associated with better improved long-term outcomes (e.g., reduced risk of relapse, decreased 
hospitalizations rates, steroid-free remission, and decreased colonic resections) (Froslie 2007, 
Klenske 2019, Rutgeerts 2007, Sandborn 2014).
Natural history of CD in the population, including mortality and morbidity:  CD symptoms can 
be chronic and intermittent for many patients, but the disease course is variable.  Debilitating 
symptoms may be associated with inflammatory Crohn's disease activity.  Patients often suffer 
from abdominal pain, fatigue, chronic diarrhea, fecal incontinence, iron deficiency anemia, 
weight loss and malnourishment.  Patients with CD have been identified to suffer from higher 
rates of depression and anxiety (Kurina 2001).  Chronic bowel inflammation can lead to 
complications such as strictures, fistula, or abscess and may result in surgeries and 
hospitalizations.  At 20 years after diagnosis, the risk of developing intestinal complications 
among CD patients is 50 percent (Thia 2010).  CD patients with disease involving the colon 
have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (Olen 2020).  The risk of mortality in CD may be 
slightly increased.  In a metanalysis of 35 studies, the standardized mortality ratio for CD 
patients was 1.38 (95% CI 1.23-1.55) compared to the general population (Bewtra 2013).
Important co-morbidities:  asthma, arthritis, arthralgia, skin disorders like erythema nodosum 
and pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, CVD, neuropsychological disorders, osteoporosis, fatigue, 
sexual dysfunction (Argollo 2019, Baumgart 2012, Kuenzig 2019).

Module SII Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
With regard to toxicity, it is important to keep in mind that risankizumab neutralizes both 
human IL-23A as well as cynomolgus monkey (nonhuman primate [NHP]) IL-23A, but does not 
bind to rat IL-23A and binding to mouse IL-23A is significantly diminished.  Therefore, 
toxicology studies in NHP can assess both potential mechanistic (on-target) and non-
mechanistic (off-target) effects of risankizumab.

Key Safety Findings (from Non-Clinical 
Relevance to Human Usage
Studies)
Carcinogenicity
Overall, the weight of evidence assessment suggests 
Genetic toxicology or traditional carcinogenicity 
a low risk of malignancy from chronic dosing with 
studies have not been conducted with 
risankizumab in humans.
risankizumab due to the nature of the molecule 
(high specificity to its target) and species 
specificity (lack of a pharmacologically relevant 
model).  Risankizumab has no known action 
related to the cell cycle and is not expected to 
have an action which influences DNA integrity.  
As risankizumab does not bind rodent IL-23 
and is therefore not pharmacologically active in 
rodents, a two-year carcinogenicity study 
would not be informative.  The toxicology 
assessment for risankizumab has not indicated 
a potential for carcinogenicity following chronic 
administration to cynomolgus monkeys.  There 
was no evidence of 
immunotoxicity/immunosuppression, enhanced 
cellular proliferation or pre-neoplastic changes 
after six months of SC dosing to cynomolgus 
monkeys at dose levels up to 50 mg/kg/week.
Therefore, a weight of evidence approach was 
followed for the evaluation of the potential 
carcinogenicity risk of risankizumab for human 
subjects.

Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Key Safety Findings (from Non-Clinical 
Relevance to Human Usage
Studies)
No dedicated studies in rodents were conducted 
because risankizumab does not bind to rodent 
IL-23A.  In toxicology studies in monkeys, 
however, no findings for potential effects on 
the central nervous system (CNS) were 
observed at the highest dose of 50 
mg/kg/week, where exposures were ≥ 69-fold 
higher than those in plaque psoriasis patients 
based on the recommended 150 mg SC dose.  
For CD, the exposures at this dose in monkeys 
were approximately 7-fold higher than those at 
the induction dose of 600 mg IV and 28-fold 
higher than those at the maintenance dose of 
360 mg SC.
Mechanisms for drug interactions

after SC, IV and paravenous administration.  
There was no evidence for local intolerability in

Method Used to Calculate Exposure
Post-marketing exposure to risankizumab is estimated to be 87,387 patient treatment-years 
(PTY) cumulatively as of 25 March 2021.
Risankizumab post-marketing patient exposure from 26 March 2019 through 25 March 2021 
was estimated from AbbVie sales and distribution data from 01 April 2019 through 
25 March 2021 using the following formula.
Number of patient treatment years (PTY) =
Number of packages sold x number of units per package
Average daily dose (ADD) × 365.25 days per year
where the ADD is the average number of drug-units taken per day for a treatment indication.
Both 150 mg dose (2 × 75 mg) and 75 mg dose are approved for risankizumab, though 75 mg 
is approved in Japan only.
The ADD for 150 mg dose is calculated as

Therefore, one PTY is equivalent to an estimated usage of 8.6963 75 mg vials (652.2269 mg) 
for 150 mg dose and 4.3484 75-mg vials (326.1317 mg) for 75 mg dose

Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in 
the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication

● Fatigue
● Injection site reactions
● Headache 
SVII.1.2
Risks/Missing Information Considered Important 
for Inclusion in the RMP
Identified risk 1:  None
Potential risk 1:  MACE
Reason for Inclusion:  Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of MACE with risankizumab; 
however, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI] 
and stroke) among the patient populations in the approved and proposed indications for risankizumab 
(i.e., psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's Disease, etc.).
Potential risk 2:  Serious infections
Reason for Inclusion:  Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of serious infection with 
risankizumab; however, immunomodulatory products have the potential to increase the risk of 
infections.

Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Potential risk 3:  Malignancies
Reason for Inclusion:  Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of malignancy with 
risankizumab; however, there is a theoretical possibility of decreased immune surveillance against 
malignancies with alteration of immune pathways.
Potential risk 4:  Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
Reason for Inclusion:  Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity 
reactions with risankizumab; however, monoclonal antibody products carry a theoretical risk of immune 
reactions against the small nonhuman part of the antibody.
Missing Information
Information 1:  Use during pregnancy and lactation
Reason for Inclusion:  Pregnant women, nursing women, and women who planned to become pregnant 
were excluded from the clinical trials, and effective contraception was mandated.  Data in pregnant 
women in the clinical trials are limited to 60 women who became pregnant during study participation 
and were exposed to risankizumab.  The pregnancy outcomes were as follows:  22 live births without 
congenital anomalies, 11 spontaneous abortions, 13 elective terminations (no known fetal defects), 
2 elective terminations (with fetal defects), 7 subjects lost to follow-up, and 5 ongoing pregnancies.  No 
nursing women were exposed to risankizumab as women were discontinued from risankizumab upon 
knowledge of pregnancy.
Data to be Collected Post-Authorization:  Routine pharmacovigilance data.  A population-based, non-
interventional, cohort study of women with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are exposed to 
risankizumab or comparator biologic during pregnancy is ongoing (see Section III.2 for additional 
details on study design).  A non-interventional cohort study will be conducted to describe risankizumab 
exposure in pregnant patients with Crohn's disease and compare pregnancy and infant outcomes to 
pregnant patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with alternative therapies (see Section III.2
for additional details on study design).
Information 2:  Use in patients with chronic HBV or chronic HCV infection
Reason for Inclusion:  Patients with known chronic or relevant acute infections including active TB, HIV, 
or viral hepatitis were excluded from the clinical trials.  Patients with chronic HBV or chronic HCV
infection have not been evaluated with risankizumab.  Patients with chronic HBV have been observed to 
be at risk for reactivation of HBV during treatment with various immunomodulators.  Whether 
reactivation of chronic HBV infection will be a risk for biologics targeting the IL-23 pathway is not 
known.  Although HCV can currently be effectively treated, chronic HCV infection may be asymptomatic, 
and patients with untreated chronic HCV infection may be treated with risankizumab.  Missing 
information will be limited to patients with chronic HBV and chronic HCV infection.  Product labeling will 
state that patients should not receive risankizumab if they have active TB, so active TB is not 
considered missing information.  Use in patients with a history of HIV will be excluded from missing 
information since this group would include patients with known HIV infection who are receiving chronic 
anti-retroviral therapy and should have suppression of HIV replication.  Use of any immunomodulatory 
product in this setting may not be different from that of a population not infected with HIV.  A 
prescriber would need to weigh the benefits and risks of use of risankizumab in a patient whose HIV 
infection is adequately suppressed.
Data to be Collected Post-Authorization:  Routine pharmacovigilance data.

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and 
Important Potential Risks
Important Identified Risk 1:  None
Important Potential Risk 1:  MACE 
MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
Potential Mechanisms:
The rationale for a correlation between psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's Disease, and atherosclerotic 
disease is not well understood.  Although the increased prevalence of risk factors for CVD (obesity, 
HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and cigarette smoking) in patients with psoriasis and 
psoriatic arthritis likely contributes to the elevated risk for atherosclerosis, the role of chronic 
inflammation in the pathogenesis of these disorders may also be a key factor (Argollo 2019, Reich 
2012).
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:
Adjudicated MACE in the integrated risankizumab clinical trial was used to assess the risk with 
risankizumab therapy.
44
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Characterization of the Risk:
Psoriasis:  Evaluating the long-term safety of all subjects with plaque psoriasis who received 
risankizumab treatment at any dose or time, the exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE was 
0.5 events per 100 PYs (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25 – 0.90).  It is in the range of MACE 
incidence rates (0.37 – 0.84 events per 100 PY) reported for other non-TNF biologic products at the 
time of their initial submission:  brodalumab (0.7, 22 events/3373 PY, 95% CI 0.43 – 1.02) (Food and 
Drug Administration [FDA] 2017), ixekizumab (0.72, 31 events/4322 PY, 95% CI 0.5 – 1.02) 
(Therapeutic Goods Administration 2017), secukinumab (0.37, 10 events/2725 PY, 95% CI 0.18 –
0.68) (Novartis 2014), ustekinumab (0.61, 9 events/1467 PYs, 95% CI 0.28 – 1.16) (Centocor 2008), 
and guselkumab (0.84, 10 events/1191 PYs, 95% CI 0.4 – 1.54) (Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research [CDER] 2017).  Further, this rate is consistent with the incidence rate of MACE in Psoriasis 
Longitudinal Assessment and Registry (PSOLAR), 0.33 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.28 – 0.39), with 
the rate for non-biologics being 0.47 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.32 – 0.65) (Papp 2015).  As of 
25 March 2021, the incidence rate is 0.51 events per 100 PY (90 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL formulations) 
in clinical trials, which remains within the reference benchmarks.  Data from clinical studies conducted 
with the 150 mg/mL formulation did not change characterization of the risk.
Psoriatic Arthritis:  In the placebo-controlled periods of the Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis studies, 
1 subject receiving risankizumab experienced a MACE of non-fatal stroke and no subjects receiving 
placebo experienced a MACE.  In the Phase 3 long-term analysis set, 2 MACE events of non-fatal MI 
were reported with long-term risankizumab exposure.  All 3 cases were considered unrelated to 
risankizumab, since the events occurred in subjects with known coronary artery disease or were 
confounded with cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, obesity, hypertension, smoking, and 
hyperlipidemia.  The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of MACE was 0.3 events per 100 PYs, consistent 
with the reported rate of MACE for the patient population (0.46 per 100 PY) (Li 2015), and within the 
range of adjudicated MACE rates of 0.6 events per 100 PYs with ixekizumab (Combe 2020) and 
0.4 events per 100 PYs with secukinumab Phase 3 long-term exposure in psoriatic arthritis 
(Deodhar 2019).  No pattern with regards to time to event onset was identified (range of 45 to 
332 days since first risankizumab exposure).
Crohn's Disease:
Considering the rarity of CV events across the risankizumab CD program (i.e., all doses, induction, 
maintenance) and the latency of CV events, patients exposed to any risankizumab was considered the 
most appropriate for this assessment.  Across the CD clinical studies, a total of 4 subjects had a MACE 
and the incidence rate of MACE (0.2/100PY) and this was not higher than the background rate for this 
patient population based on published estimates (0.82/100 PY) (Kristensen 2013).  All subjects who 
had a MACE had cardiovascular risk factors or a history of CV disease.
In a Danish population-based study, compared to disease-free adults, the rate of CV events was 
marginally increased in CD, with adjusted rate ratios estimated to be 1.35 (95% CI: 1.03 – 1.77) for 
myocardial infarction (MI), 1.37 (95% CI: 1.10-1.72) for stroke, and 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36 – 1.95) for CV 
death (Kristensen 2013).  Major adverse cardiac events, defined as a composite measure of MI, stroke 
and CV death, had an incidence rate of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72 – 0.93) per 100 PY and an incidence rate 
ratio of 1.48 (95% CI: 1.28 – 1.70) (Kristensen 2013).  Among patients with CD, the incidence rate 
(per 100 PY) was 0.22 for MI, 0.32 for stroke, and 0.52 for CV death (Kristensen 2013).

Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Patients with traditional cardiac risk factors, i.e., age, sex, family history of premature coronary artery 
disease (CAD), current smoking, HTN, low high-density lipoprotein, are at higher risk of CAD.  Other 
risk factors include DM (insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated blood glucose are associated 
with atherosclerotic CVD) (Kannel 1979a, Kannel 1979b, Almdal 2004, Zavaroni 1989, Gerstein 1999), 
chronic kidney disease (increased coronary heart disease [CHD] risk in patients with end-stage renal 
disease has been well described, but there is now clear evidence that mild to moderate renal 
dysfunction is also associated with a substantial increase in CHD risk) (Gansevoort 2013), other lifestyle 
factors (lack of exercise, psychosocial factors), and metabolic syndrome.
Preventability:
As is known for the general population, interventions geared towards the modifiable cardiac risk factors 
cited above (HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking) can be influential in reducing the MACE/CV 
risk.  
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
With appropriate risk minimization measures, the risk benefit balance remains positive.
Public Health Impact:
MACE is a well-recognized co-morbidity with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.  Given the 
comparable incidence rates of MACE with other biologics at the time of their initial submission and 
consistency of long-term rates with real world data, long-term epidemiologic data from literature within 
the approved and proposed indications of risankizumab, no adverse public health impact due to 
risankizumab is anticipated.
Important Potential Risk 2:  Serious infections 
MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
Potential Mechanisms:
Binding of risankizumab to IL-23 p19 inhibits the action of IL-23 to induce and sustain T helper (Th) 17 
type cells, innate lymphoid cells, γδT cells, and natural killer cells responsible for tissue inflammation, 
destruction and aberrant tissue repair.  Due to the immunomodulatory effects of risankizumab, there is 
a risk for serious infections. 
Evidence Source and Strength of Evidence:
Integrated risankizumab clinical trial data was used to assess the risk with risankizumab therapy, and 
epidemiologic data were used to contextualize the risankizumab data.
Characterization of the Risk:
Psoriasis:  Evaluating the safety of subjects with plaque psoriasis during 16 weeks of the double-blind 
phase of the Phase 2 and 3 trials, 0.4% of subjects in the risankizumab 150 – 180 mg treatment 
groups experienced at least 1 event of serious infection compared to 0.3% of subjects in the placebo 
group.  The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious infections in this analysis cohort is 1.7 events 
per 100 PYs in the risankizumab 150 – 180 mg treatment groups compared to 1.1 events per 100 PYs 
in the placebo group.  When comparing risankizumab to ustekinumab at 52 weeks, the exposure-
adjusted incidence rate of serious infections is 1.8 events per 100 PYs in the risankizumab 150 mg 
treatment group compared to 2.5 events per 100 PYs in the ustekinumab treatment group.  Thus, the 
rates of serious infections are comparable in subjects treated with risankizumab compared to placebo or 
46
 
Risankizumab

Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
an approved product for plaque psoriasis (ustekinumab) in short and longer term exposure.  The 
incidence rate for serious infections with risankizumab treatment in plaque psoriasis patients was in the 
range (1.02 – 2.0 events per 100 PYs) reported for other non-TNF biologics at the time of their initial 
submission:  brodalumab (1.3, 95% CI 1.02 – 1.62) (European Medicines Agency 2017), ustekinumab 
(1.02, 95% CI 0.57 – 1.69) (Centocor 2008), ixekizumab (2.0, 95% CI 1.53 – 2.51) (Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research 2016a, TALTZ  2017), secukinumab (1.47, 95% CI 1.05 – 2.01) (van de 
Kerkhof 2016), and guselkumab (1.17, 95% CI 0.56 – 2.16) (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 
2016b).  As of 25 March 2021, the long-term (long-term all risankizumab psoriasis exposure) exposure-
adjusted incidence rate of serious infections in clinical trials has remained consistent at 1.2 events per 
100 PY.
Psoriatic Arthritis:  In the placebo-controlled periods of the Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis studies, the 
percentage of subjects with serious infections in the risankizumab group (1.0%) was comparable to the 
placebo group (1.6%), with an event rate of 2.7 per 100 PYs.  The only serious infections reported in 
≥ 2 subjects in a group was cellulitis (2 subjects) in the risankizumab group and pneumonia 
(2 subjects) in the placebo group.  In the Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis long-term analysis set, the 
exposure-adjusted incidence rate of serious infections was 2.6 events per 100 PY for subjects treated 
with risankizumab 150 mg.  It should be noted that approximately 60% of subjects were on 
concomitant methotrexate and the majority of the psoriatic arthritis Phase 3 study periods were 
conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The most common (≥ 0.1 events per 100 PY) serious 
infections with long-term risankizumab exposure were pneumonia and COVID-19 followed by cellulitis.  
There was 1 treatment-emergent death reported due to urosepsis in an elderly patient with dementia 
and multiple other comorbidities.  No case of active TB was reported in subjects treated with 
risankizumab.  The rate of serious infections associated with long-term risankizumab exposure 
(2.6 events per 100 PY) is within the expected range for this patient population based on published 
estimates (3.98 events per 100 PY) (Shah 2017).  The types of serious infections reported were 
consistent with those anticipated in a population of patients with psoriatic arthritis.
Crohn's Disease:
12-Week Induction
In the induction period, serious infections were reported at a lower percentage and rate among subjects 
in the risankizumab group (0.9%, 3.4 E/100 PY in the 600 mg IV group) compared to subjects in the 
placebo group (3.6%, 16.7 E/100PY).  The higher rate of serious infections in the placebo group was 
driven primarily by more events of gastrointestinal abscess.  None of the serious infections reported in 
risankizumab subjects were reported in more than one subject and none led to discontinuation of study 
drug.
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks
The rate of serious infection was 6.0 E/100 PY and 5.0 E/100 PY for the risankizumab 360 mg SC arm 
and the withdrawal (placebo SC) arm, respectively.  None of the serious infections in risankizumab 
treated subjects led to study drug discontinuation.  There were no specific patterns in types of serious 
infections with risankizumab treatment.
47
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Any Risankizumab
The rate of serious infection in patients exposed to any risankizumab was 3.2 E/100PY and not higher 
than the expected range for this patient population based on published estimates.  The most common 
serious infections were appendicitis (0.3 E/100 PY, 5 events) and peritonitis (0.3 E/100 PY, 4 events).  
Overall, 2 subjects discontinued study drug due to serious infection.
CD is associated with increased risk of infection (Irving 2021).  In a nationwide population based study 
conducted in France, incidence rate (per 100 PY) among patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD), including CD and ulcerative colitis, was 0.94 for serious infections (Kirchgesner 2018).
Treatment of CD may be associated with an increased risk of serious infection (Kirchgesner 2018).  This 
risk may differ by treatment option.  The incidence rate of serious infections (per 100 PY) varied by 
treatment options with 0.84 in patients with IBD unexposed to thiopurines and anti-TNFs, 1.89 in those 
treated with anti-TNF monotherapy, and 2.24 in patients treated with thiopurine/anti-TNF combination 
therapy (Kirchgesner 2018).  In a nationwide population-based study in Denmark, using a broader 
definition of serious infection, the incidence rate (per 100 PY) for serious infections was 8 and 6 among 
patients with IBD exposed and unexposed to anti-TNF, respectively, within a year of treatment start 
(Nyboe Andersen 2015).  Integrated safety analyses of ustekinumab Phase 2/3 CD studies found that 
the rate of serious infections through 1 year follow-up was similar across treatment groups:  6.64 per 
100 PY in placebo and 6.06 per 100 PY in the ustekinumab-treated group (Sandborn 2021).  The most 
common serious infections in IBD patients (both treated and untreated) affected the lungs (24.2%) 
with pneumonia being the most prevalent diagnosis (20.2%) (Kirchgesner 2018).
Overall, the data did not suggest an increased risk of serious infection with risankizumab treatment in 
subjects with CD.  The types of serious infections reported were consistent with those anticipated in a 
population of patients with CD.  The rate of serious infection was not higher than the rate observed in 
published studies for this patient population
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
The elderly and patients with other risk factors compromising immunity such as diabetes or chronic 
renal insufficiency are at increased risk.
Preventability:
Early detection of serious systemic infection can improve outcomes.  There are no laboratory correlates 
such as white blood cell or neutrophil counts that can influence early detection/ prevention.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
With appropriate risk minimization measures, the risk benefit balance remains positive.
Public Health Impact:
Serious infections evolving to sepsis can be associated with major morbidity and mortality.  Adequate 
precautions have been outlined in the labeling for early identification and mitigation of serious 
infections.  Therefore, a significant impact on public health is not anticipated.
Important Potential Risk 3:  Malignancies
MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
Potential Mechanisms:
Inflammation is now accepted as a hallmark and an enabling characteristic of cancer (Langan 2012).  
Upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with anti-bacterial responses, particularly in a 
48
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
chronic inflammation setting, has been shown to be contributing factors to tumorigenesis (Voiculescu 
2014).  Chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis through the activation of the nuclear factor 
(NF)-kB (NF-kB) and signal transducer and activator transcription (STAT)3 pathways (Azfar 2012, 
Qureshi 2009).  Prolonged STAT3 signaling in malignant cells controls survival and proliferation through 
upregulation of Bcl-Xl, Mcl1 and c-Myc levels (Gelfand 2006).  In the local tumor environment, STAT3 
activation leads to the expression of IL-23, and elevated levels of IL-23 can be found in several human 
carcinomas and correlated with a poor prognosis (Aratari 2008, Gelfand 2006, Huerta 2007).  
Moreover, genome-wide association studies identified two variants of IL-23R that may increase the risk 
of cancer development (Ahlehoff 2012).
While the pro-tumorigenic role of IL-23 has been shown in a number of studies, there are also reports 
supporting a tumor suppressive function of IL-23.  One possible explanation is that the amount of IL-23 
expressed in the tumor environment might determine the pro- or anti-tumorigenic role of the cytokine.  
In the latter case, blocking IL-23 could potentially increase the risk of carcinogenesis.  Furthermore, 
IL-23 is unlikely to increase the risk for cancer, as expression of IL-23 is increased in human tumors.  
Preclinical data have, moreover, demonstrated beneficial effect of IL-23 p19 inhibition in animal 
models, both for pre-existing and tumor-induction models (Langowski 2006).
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:
Integrated risankizumab clinical trial data was used to assess the risk with risankizumab therapy.  
Characterization of the Risk:
Psoriasis:
Evaluating the long-term safety of all subjects with plaque psoriasis that received risankizumab 
treatment at any dose or time, the exposure-adjusted incidence rates of malignancies and malignancies 
excluding NMSC are 1.3 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.89 – 1.91) and 0.5 events per 100 PYs 
(95% CI 0.22 – 0.84), respectively.  When comparing risankizumab to ustekinumab at 52 weeks, the 
exposure-adjusted incidence rates of malignancies appear similar, with 0.5 events per 100 PYs for each 
treatment arm (150 mg risankizumab 95% CI 0.10 – 1.42, ustekinumab 95% CI 0.01 – 2.76).  The 
rates for malignancies excluding NMSC were 0 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.00 – 0.48) in subjects 
treated with 150 mg risankizumab, and 0.5 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.01 – 2.76) in subjects 
treated with ustekinumab.  The incidence rate of malignancies for risankizumab in the plaque psoriasis 
population (1.3 events per 100 PYs) is in the range (0.81 – 1.3 events per 100 PYs) of that reported for 
other non-TNF biologics in psoriasis population at the time of their initial submission:  brodalumab 
(0.81, 95% CI 0.59 – 1.06) (FDA 2016), ustekinumab (1.3, 95% CI 0.78 – 2.03) (Centocor 2008), 
ixekizumab (0.97, 95% CI 0.71 – 1.27) (CDER 2016a), secukinumab (0.96, 95% CI 0.63 – 1.4) 
(Van de Kerkhof 2016), guselkumab (0.93, 95% CI 0.43 – 1.63) (CDER 2016b).  Likewise, the 
incidence rate of malignancies excluding NMSC for risankizumab in the plaque psoriasis population 
(0.5 events per 100 PYs) is in the range (0.31 – 0.49 events per 100 PYs) of that reported for other 
non-TNF biologics (brodalumab rate not publicly available) in psoriasis population at the time of their 
initial submission:  ustekinumab (0.34, 95% CI 0.11 – 0.7) (Centocor 2008), ixekizumab (0.49, 
95% CI 0.31 – 0.70) (CDER 2016a), secukinumab (0.48, 95% CI 0.25 – 0.82) (Van de Kerkhof 2016), 
guselkumab (0.31, 95% CI 0.06 – 0.90) (CDER 2016b).  Further, these rates are consistent with the 
incidence rate in the PSOLAR; the incidence rates of malignancies excluding NMSC in subjects treated 
with ustekinumab, infliximab, and other biologics are 0.48 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.37 – 0.61), 
0.79 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.57 – 1.05), and 0.73 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 0.6 – 0.86) 
respectively (Papp 2015).  As of 12 October 2020, the long-term (long-term all risankizumab psoriasis 
exposure) exposure-adjusted incidence rates of malignancies and malignancies excluding NMSC has 
49
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
remained consistent at 1.2 events per 100 PYs (95% CI 1.03 – 1.50) and 0.6 events per 100 PYs 
(95% CI 0.44 – 0.76), respectively.
Psoriatic Arthritis: In the placebo-controlled periods of the Phase 3 psoriatic arthritis studies, 1 NMSC 
of basal cell carcinoma was reported in the risankizumab group and 1 NMSC of Bowen's disease was 
reported in the placebo group.  No malignancies excluding NMSC were reported in the risankizumab 
group and 2 were reported in the placebo group (breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer).  With 
long-term risankizumab exposure, 2 events of malignancies excluding NMSC (acral lentiginous 
melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer) were observed.  In the Phase 3 long-term analysis set, the 
long-term exposure-adjusted event rate of malignancies excluding NMSC was low with long-term 
risankizumab exposure (0.2 events per 100 PYs) and is within the epidemiologic reference rate in the 
psoriatic arthritis population (0.48 events per 100 PYs) (Vaengebjerg 2020).  The rate of NMSC with 
long-term risankizumab exposure was 0.6 events per 100 PYs and is within the epidemiological 
reference rate in the psoriatic arthritis population (0.61 events per 100PY) (Vaengebjerg 2020) and 
within the rates of NMSC in the ixekizumab Phase 3 long-term exposure in psoriatic arthritis (0.3 events 
per 100 PY; 95% CI, 0.1–1.0 for year 1 data) (Combe 2020).
Crohn's Disease:
12-Week Induction
In the induction periods there were no events of malignancy in the risankizumab 600 mg IV group.
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks 
In the maintenance period, the incidence rates of malignancies were low, with 1 event of breast cancer 
(0.6/100 PY) in the 360 mg arm and 1 event of basal cell carcinoma (0.6/100 PY in the withdrawal 
[placebo SC] arm).  Both subjects had risk factors and the events were considered to have no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug by the investigator.
Any Risankizumab
The incidence rate of malignancies in patients exposed to any risankizumab was 0.5/100 PY.  There 
were a total of 12 events in patients exposed to any risankizumab reported in 11 subjects (including 
3 events of lung cancer and 3 events of breast cancer).
Patients with CD have a modestly increased risk of cancer overall partially due to an increased risk of 
gastrointestinal cancers, especially colorectal cancer (Lo 2021, Long 2012).  Long-lasting exposures to 
immunosuppressive therapies, underlying disease, and lifestyle factors may contribute to the 
development of cancer in patients with CD (Taborelli 2020).  In a population-based cohort study 
conducted in northeastern Italy linking local healthcare databases and the cancer registry from 1995 to 
2013, with a total follow-up time of 10,558 PY for CD, incidence rate (per 100 PY) was 1.33 for overall 
cancer, 0.98 for cancer excluding NMSC, and 0.36 for NMSC among patients with CD; standardized 
incidence ratio was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.01-1.41) for overall cancer, 1.07 (95% CI: 0.87-1.30) for cancer 
excluding NMSC, and 1.86 (95% CI: 1.32-2.55) for NMSC (Taborelli 2020).  Another population-based 
cohort study conducted in Denmark and Sweden found that the incidence rate (per 100 PY) of 
colorectal cancer was 0.08 in patients with CD and 0.06 in the general population, resulting in an 
adjusted hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.27-1.53) (Olen 2020).  Gastrointestinal cancer risk in CD, 
particularly colorectal cancer, has been decreasing over time partly due to earlier and more frequent 
use of immunosuppressive agents and biologics, which may be more effective in controlling 
inflammation (Kappelman 2014).
The rate of malignancy in the risankizumab-treated CD population is within the expected range for this 
patient population based on published estimates.  The types of malignancies reported in the CD 
program (i.e., breast and lung cancer) were consistent with the most common cancers reported in the 
50

Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
general population and do not suggest an increased risk of malignancies with risankizumab treatment 
(Ferlay 2021, Sung 2021).
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Multiple factors may contribute to an increased rate of malignancy in patients using immunosuppressive 
or immunomodulatory therapies, which are used in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.  The 
traditional systemic therapies, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, and mycophenolate mofetil, may be 
associated with an increased risk of lymphoproliferative disorders during treatment, demonstrated in 
clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease documented in case reports.  
However, the majority of studies examining this carcinogenic risk suggest that tumor necrosis factor-
alpha inhibitors may cause a slightly increased risk of cancer, including non-melanoma skin cancer and 
hematologic malignancies.
Preventability:
Routine standard of care for early detection of malignancy can be followed.  In addition, patients may 
be under close care of dermatologists, skilled towards early detection of skin cancers.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
With appropriate risk minimization measures, the risk benefit balance remains positive.
Public Health Impact:
Given the comparable incidence rates of malignancies and malignancies excluding NMSC with other 
biologics at the time of their initial submission and consistency of long-term rates with real world data 
and epidemiologic reference data, no adverse public health impact due to risankizumab is anticipated.
Important Potential Risk 4:  Serious hypersensitivity reactions 
MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
Potential Mechanisms:
Biological drugs have been reported to cause hypersensitivity reactions (Corominas 2014).  The 
hypersensitivity reactions might be immediate onset (possible IgE mediated) or delayed onset (due to 
IgG formation, and T-cell mediated).  Immediate reactions appear during the first hours after 
administration and are very heterogeneous in etiology and presentation (nausea, vomiting, skin 
reactions, respiratory symptoms, hypotension).  Some reactions involve release of cytokines by 
immune system cells due to activation by the drug itself, other cases involve the participation of an 
IgE-mediated mechanism.  Delayed hypersensitivity reactions can appear between 1 to 2 hours and 
14 days after administration, often with serum sickness–like symptoms.  As a biologic protein, systemic 
or subcutaneous administration of risankizumab may be associated with immunogenicity 
(i.e., development of anti-drug antibodies) as well as hypersensitivity reactions.
Evidence Sources and Strength of Evidence:
The risk varies depending on the biologic used and is reflected in the individual biologic labels.  
Integrated risankizumab clinical trial data was used to assess the risk with risankizumab therapy.

Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Characterization of the Risk:
Psoriasis:  As of 12 October 2020, the rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions was < 0.1 events per 
100 PY and none of the events had a causal relation with risankizumab, as assessed by the sponsor in 
subjects treated across the development program.  
Psoriatic Arthritis:  In the Phase 3 long-term analysis set, no cases of serious hypersensitivity 
reaction were reported.  In a Phase 2 psoriatic arthritis trial, 1 subject had a serious hypersensitivity 
reaction of anaphylactic reaction.  The subject did not experience respiratory symptoms, facial swelling, 
pruritus, or urticaria and did not require epinephrine or steroids.  Based upon the reported symptoms, 
AbbVie does not consider the details of this case to be consistent with an IgE-mediated anaphylactic 
reaction.
Crohn's Disease:
12-Week Induction
Serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported at 0.2%, 0.6 E/100 PY in the 600 mg IV group.
Maintenance up to 52 Weeks
There were no events of serious hypersensitivity reactions or adjudicated anaphylactic reactions across 
the treatment arms.
Any Risankizumab
The rate of serious hypersensitivity reactions across any risankizumab exposure (<0.1 E/100 PY) was 
low.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Several factors influence the propensity towards development of hypersensitivity reactions including 
degree of humanization of the antibody, cell line from which the drug is obtained (CHO produces 
virtually no 1,3-galactosyltransferase, resulting in a glycosylation pattern much different from that of 
other drugs such as cetuximab [derived from the murine cell line SP2/O], thereby reducing the risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions) and the excipients used (Corominas 2014).  Host factors include the 
indication for the treatment (e.g., atopic tendencies in patients with asthma), patient's immune status, 
and concomitant medications.
Preventability:
A patient should not be rechallenged with the drug in the case of a systemic hypersensitivity reaction 
judged related to the product.
Impact on the Risk-Benefit Balance of the Product:
With appropriate risk minimization measures, the risk benefit balance remains positive.
Public Health Impact:
Biologics, being proteins, are known to have a risk of hypersensitivity.  Though non-systemic reactions 
including rash and urticaria have been reported with risankizumab, they were predominantly non-
serious and in rare instances led to treatment discontinuation.  A significant impact on public health is 
not anticipated.

MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
•
Population in need of further characterization
Pregnant women, nursing women, and women who planned to become pregnant were excluded from 
the clinical trials.  Further characterization of pregnancy outcomes in women who become pregnant 
while receiving risankizumab will be needed.  Routine pharmacovigilance data will be collected.  A 
population-based, non-interventional, cohort study of women with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who 
are exposed to risankizumab or comparator biologic during pregnancy is ongoing (see Section III.2 for 
additional details on study design).  A non-interventional cohort study will be conducted to describe 
risankizumab exposure in pregnant patients with Crohn's disease and compare pregnancy and infant 
outcomes to pregnant patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with alternative therapies.
Missing information 2:  Long-term safety 
MedDRA terms:  See Annex 1.
•
Population in need of further characterization
Long-term risankizumab clinical safety data are currently limited.  Psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and 
Crohn's Disease are chronic diseases requiring long-term treatment.  Therefore, further characterization 
of the safety profile is needed for events with a low frequency and/or long latency.  Data from routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and data from multiple long-term cohort studies in real world settings are 
being/will be collected, as are data from the long-term extension portions Phase 3 trials in subjects with 
Plaque Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis.

Post-Authorization Safety Studies)
III.1
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection 
include:
● Biweekly line listing review of all post-marketing reports, serious and nonserious, 
received from all sources (including literature) and includes serious adverse events 
from clinical trials.
● Quarterly review of data mining scores generated from FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System database.
● Periodic reports to agencies (e.g., periodic safety update reports, development 
safety update reports, periodic adverse drug experience reports) with inclusion of 
sections outlining findings for adverse events of interest.  These will occur per 
mandated timelines.
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for pregnancy:
AbbVie has a standardized global process for the use of follow-up questionnaires within the 
pharmacovigilance system as part of post-marketing surveillance.  This process includes 
contact to the healthcare professional (HCP) or reporter using the questionnaire via phone, fax 
or send letter/form.  The follow-up to consumer will include an attempt to obtain consent to 
contact the HCP.  A minimum number of queries are made depending on the seriousness of the 
case; medical judgment or local regulations are applied to determine if further attempts (above 
the minimum) should be made.  Data collection using the questionnaires will be done for 
pregnancy as described in Annex 4.
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities:

Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities
Additional pharmacovigilance studies are proposed to evaluate safety risks including 
malignancies, MACE, serious infections, serious hypersensitivity reactions, and use in 
pregnancy.
Long-Term Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Psoriasis in Real World Setting
Study Short Name and Title:  A long term registry-based prospective cohort study of long-term 
safety of risankizumab in Denmark and Sweden (Study P19-633)
54
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Rationale and Study Objectives:  Clinical trials of risankizumab did not allow us to fully 
characterize the risk of malignancies, MACE, serious infections and serious hypersensitivity 
reactions.  Therefore, they are considered potential risks.  These potential risks will be studied 
via a post-marketing long term cohort comparison study.  The aim of the study is to estimate 
the risks of malignancy, MACE, serious infections, and serious hypersensitivity reactions, 
among individuals who were exposed to risankizumab for the treatment of psoriasis, relative to 
comparative cohorts, that is, similar patients treated with:  i) TNF-α inhibitors; ii) other IL 
inhibitors; and iii) non-biological systemic treatments.
Study Design:  A cohort study will be carried out utilizing linked data from the Danish and 
Swedish national registers to estimate rates of malignancy, MACE, serious infections, and 
serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with risankizumab for psoriasis and to 
estimate event risks relative to those treated with other systemic therapies.
Study Population:  All psoriasis patients (which includes patients with arthropathic psoriasis 
(PsA) [ICD-10-CM L40.5x]) who have filled at least one prescription of a biological drug 
(IL-inhibitors [L04AC] and/or TNF-α inhibitors [L04AB]), or have been administrated a 
biological drug in the hospital (e.g., infliximab), as well as all psoriasis patients who have filled 
at least one prescription of non-biological systemic treatment (methotrexate, ciclosporin, and 
acitretin) or have been treated with phototherapy (procedure codes from the patient registers) 
will be identified from the prescription and other databases in Denmark and Sweden from 
January 01, 2020 and enrolled for a prospective follow-up.  The study will accrue patients from 
April 2019 through 31 December 2024 and then follow up the patients through 31 December 
2032.  Based on the use of ustekinumab and secukinumab within the Danish and Swedish 
databases, the estimated number of patients with psoriasis identified as risankizumab users 
will range from 1656 to 3384 over a 12-year period.
Using an exploratory analysis of these Danish and Swedish databases from 2006 to 2013, it is 
expected that at minimum, the number of PsA patients will be one-third of all psoriasis 
patients.  This will result in a range of 552 to 1128 patients with PsA exposed to risankizumab.  
The main statistical analysis for each outcome as defined in the P19-633 protocol will also be 
conducted for this subset of individuals with PsA.

Long-Term Comparative Cohort Study in Patients with Crohn's Disease in a Real 
World Setting
Study Short Name and Title:  A comparative cohort study of long-term safety of risankizumab 
in patients with Crohn's disease (Study P23-654)
Rationale and Study Objectives:  The clinical trial program was not able to fully characterize 
the safety profile of risankizumab in the Crohn's disease population.  Additional long-term data 
are needed from the real-world experience of patients with Crohn's disease treated with 
risankizumab to assess product potential risks.
Study Design:  A comparative cohort study will be conducted to estimate rates of malignancy 
(malignancy excluding NMSC, NMSC), serious infections, serious hypersensitivity reactions, and 
MACE in risankizumab treated patients with Crohn's disease, relative to alternative systemic 
therapies (e.g., biologics).  The study will be conducted within the Swedish Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Register (SWIBREG) and the National Registers of Sweden and Denmark.  
Validated disease and outcome definitions, and appropriate methods for confounding control 
will be utilized.
Study Population:  All patients with Crohn's disease (with age per labeled indication) who have 
filled at least one prescription for risankizumab or comparator treatment will be identified in 
the data source after a specified start date and included in the study.
Milestones:
● Start data collection period:  Q4 2024
● Interim report:  Q4 2029
● End data collection period:  Q4 2032
● Final report:  Q2 2034
Pregnancy Exposure and Outcomes for Women with Psoriasis Treated with 
Risankizumab
Study Short Name and Title:  Pregnancy Exposures and Outcomes in Women with Psoriasis 
Treated with Risankizumab:  A Cohort Study Utilizing Large Electronic Healthcare Databases 
with Mother-Baby Linkage in the United States (Study P16-751)
Rationale and Study Objectives:  Available clinical trial data is inadequate to assess whether 
there is a risk for women receiving risankizumab while pregnant.  Based on available data 
regarding the number of pregnant women who have received other biologic treatments 
including adalimumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, the Sponsor 
predicts that use of risankizumab by women who become pregnant will be rare.  Therefore, a 
56
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
traditional pregnancy registry will not afford an adequate assessment of pregnancy outcomes.  
This study will compare pre-specified pregnancy, birth and infant outcomes among women 
exposed to risankizumab versus comparators during pregnancy (anti-TNF-α, interleukin [IL]-17 
biologics or their biosimilars [comparator biologic-exposed group] for moderate to severe 
psoriasis).
Study Design:  The study will be a population-based, non-interventional, cohort study of 
women with moderate-to-severe psoriasis who are exposed to risankizumab or comparator 
biologic during pregnancy.  The study will leverage the longitudinal nature of healthcare 
databases that have complete longitudinal capture of medical encounters and prescription 
medication exposures for large cohorts.  Pregnancies with outcomes occurring during the 
period 01 May 2019 to 31 December 2026, and infant outcomes identified from these 
pregnancies for a 1-year period ending in Q4 2027 (i.e., the end of the study period for infant 
outcomes will be Q4 2027) will be included, with a provision to extend the period with 
additional years of data to reach the desired sample size.
Study Population:  Adult women of child-bearing age with psoriasis or arthropathic psoriasis 
(PsA) will serve as the study population.  There will be two specific cohorts of women included 
in this study:  1) women exposed to risankizumab but not exposed to other biologic therapies 
at any time during pregnancy (risankizumab-exposed cohort); and 2) women exposed to an 
anti-TNF-α, IL-17 biologics or their biosimilars for moderate-to-severe psoriasis at any time 
during pregnancy (comparator biologic-exposed cohort).  In addition, women with psoriasis 
unexposed to treatment under investigation will serve as a frame of reference and be included 
for descriptive analysis only to provide context to the rates of outcomes observed in the 
risankizumab-exposed and comparator biologic-exposed groups.  Women with PsA will be 
captured and analyzed in a subgroup analysis.
Milestones:  Approximate dates for important milestones for this study are listed below.  
Additionally, annual surveillance (ie, progress) reports will be submitted within the PSUR.

Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
Rationale and Study Objectives:  The clinical trial programs did not assess the safety of 
risankizumab use during pregnancy.  In addition to the study of risankizumab exposure in 
psoriasis patients, a study of pregnancy outcomes in patients with Crohn's disease who are 
exposed to risankizumab, compared to alternative biologic treatments, will be conducted.
Study Design:  A comparative cohort study will be conducted to describe risankizumab 
exposure in pregnant patients with Crohn's disease and compare pregnancy and infant 
outcomes to pregnant patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with alternative 
therapies (e.g., biologics).  In addition, descriptive analyses of pregnancy outcomes in Crohn's 
disease patients without exposure to any treatments under investigation will also be 
conducted.
Study Population:  Women of child-bearing age with Crohn's disease will comprise the study 
population.  Patients (with age per labeled indication) who have filled at least one prescription 
for risankizumab or comparator treatment and are considered to be exposed to treatment 
during pregnancy will be included in the study.  The study will be conducted within the network 
of administrative claims data with mother-baby linkage within the FDA Sentinel Distributed 
Database.

Risankizumab Psoriasis Study
Study Title:  A multicenter, open Label study to assess the safety and efficacy of rIsankizuMab 
for MaInTenance in moderate to severe pLaquE type pSoriaSis (LIMMITLESS) (Study M15-997)
Rationale:  To establish the long-term safety and efficacy of risankizumab.
Objectives:  The primary objective of Study M15-997 is to investigate long-term safety 
(including the safety concerns e.g., MACE, malignancies, serious infections and serious 
hypersensitivity reactions) and tolerability of risankizumab in subjects with psoriasis who have 
completed one of the preceding Phase 2/3 studies.  The secondary objective of Study M15-997 
is to investigate the long-term efficacy of risankizumab in the treatment of psoriasis.
Study Design:  This is a Phase 3, single-arm, multicenter open-label extension study designed 
to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of 150 mg risankizumab in the treatment of 
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  Approximately 2200 subjects who meet the entry 
58
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
criteria are planned to be enrolled in this study, rolling over from the preceding Phase 2/3 
studies.
During this study, all subjects will receive risankizumab 150 mg subcutaneously every 
12 weeks for 252 weeks.  Study visits will occur every 12 weeks starting from Baseline until 
the Week 156 visit.  From Week 156 until the End of Treatment, subject visits will occur every 
24 weeks.  At Weeks 168, 192, 216, and 240, subjects or caregivers will self-administer 
risankizumab at home after having been instructed at Week 156 by site staff on how to self-
inject via the pre-filled syringe.  Alternatively, subjects may receive the study drug at 
Weeks 168, 192, 216, and 240 at the study site.  Subjects will return to the clinic for an End-
of-Observation (EOO) visit 20 weeks after their last administered dose of risankizumab.  Study 
completion is defined as a subject having completed the EOO visit.
In order to recognize any safety signals as early as possible, an independent data-monitoring 
committee (DMC) will monitor unblinded data from all studies where subjects are receiving 
risankizumab.  As the sponsor has comprehensive safety monitoring measures in place to 
enable signal detection in open-label studies, monitoring by the independent DMC will no 
longer be in effect for this open-label study.  Routine pharmacovigilance surveillance will 
continue to be conducted.  An independent adjudication committee will be adjudicating all 
observed cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular events, including MACE, in a blinded manner.  
In addition, an independent committee will adjudicate all serious hypersensitivity reactions.
Milestones:
● Original protocol approved:  22 September 2016
● Current protocol amendment 7 approved:  17 November 2020
● Estimated final report approval:  Q4 2024
Risankizumab Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Study Title:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Study Comparing Risankizumab to Placebo 
in Subjects with Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Who Have a History of Inadequate Response to 
or Intolerance to at Least One Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) Therapy 
(KEEPsAKE 1) (Study M16-011)
Rationale:  To evaluate the treatment of moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis in 
subjects who have a demonstrated inadequate response (lack of efficacy after a minimum 
12-week duration of therapy) or intolerance to at least 1 csDMARD therapy (csDMARD-IR).
Objective:  The primary objective in Period 1 is to compare the efficacy of risankizumab 
150 mg versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis in 
subjects with active psoriatic arthritis who have a history of inadequate response to or 
intolerance to at least one DMARD therapy.  The objective in open-label Period 2 is to evaluate 
59
 
Risankizumab

Version 4.6 / Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg in subjects with 
psoriatic arthritis who have completed Period 1.
Study Design:  Phase 3, 2-period, multicenter study designed to investigate the long-term 
safety and efficacy of 150 mg risankizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active 
psoriatic arthritis.  Nine hundred sixty-four subjects were randomized in Study M16-011.
During double-blind, placebo-controlled Period 1, study visits occurred at Week 0, Week 4, 
Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, and dosing in Period 1 occurred at Week 0, Week 4, and 
Week 16.  During open-label Period 2, all subjects receive risankizumab 150 mg 
subcutaneously every 12 weeks from Week 28 and for the remaining dosing visits (to 
Week 208).  For all subjects continuing to participate in Period 2, the open-label portion of the 
study, dosing visits will be scheduled to Week 208 unless they discontinue study drug or study 
participation earlier in the study.  The Follow-up Period consists of a completion visit 12 weeks 
after the last study drug dose.  An additional follow-up phone call will occur 8 weeks later, 
20 weeks after last study drug dose, to determine the status of any ongoing adverse 
events/serious adverse events or the occurrence of any new adverse events/serious adverse 
events.
An independent adjudication committee will adjudicate all observed cardio-vascular and 
cerebro-vascular events, including MACE, in a blinded manner.  In addition, an anaphylactic 
adjudication committee will adjudicate any serious hypersensitivity reactions.

Summary of the Risk Management Plan
Summary of risk management plan for Skyrizi® (risankizumab)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Skyrizi.  The RMP details important 
risks of Skyrizi, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Skyrizi's risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Skyrizi's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Skyrizi should be used.
73
 
Risankizumab
Core/EU Risk Management Plan 
Version 4.6/ Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
This summary of the RMP for Skyrizi should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which 
are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Skyrizi's 
RMP.
I
The Medicine and What it Is Used For
Skyrizi is authorized for treatment of 
● Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults
● Psoriatic arthritis alone or in combination with methotrexate in adults 
● Moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in adults
See the SmPC for the full indication statements.  Skyrizi contains risankizumab as the active 
substance and is given by subcutaneous (SC) injection and IV infusion.
Further information about the evaluation of Skyrizi's benefits can be found in Skyrizi's EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine's 
webpage.
II
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities 
to Minimize or Further Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Skyrizi, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Skyrizi's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
● Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
● Important advice on the medicine's packaging;
● The authorized pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
● The medicine's legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed so that immediate action can be taken, as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.

If important information that may affect the safe use of Skyrizi is not yet available, it is listed 
under "missing information" below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Skyrizi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Skyrizi.  Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with traditional cardiac risk factors, i.e., age, sex, family 
history of premature coronary artery disease (CAD), current 
smoking, hypertension (HTN), low high-density lipoprotein, are at 
higher risk of CAD.  Other risk factors include DM (insulin 
resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated blood glucose are 
associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [CVD]) 
(Almdal 2004, Gerstein 1999, Kannel 1979a, Kannel 1979b, 
Zavaroni 1989), chronic kidney disease (increased coronary heart 
disease [CHD] risk in patients with end-stage renal disease has 
been well described, but there is now clear evidence that mild to 
moderate renal dysfunction is also associated with a substantial 
increase in CHD risk) (Gansevoort 2013), other lifestyle factors 
(lack of exercise, psychosocial factors), and metabolic syndrome.

immune function, resulting in a risk of serious infection.  In patients 
with psoriasis not treated with biologics, the incidence rates of 
serious infections ranged from approximately 0.3 to 2.1 per 100 Pys 
(Gottlieb 2014, Reich 2015).  In patients with psoriatic arthritis, the 
incidence rate of serious infections was (3.98 events per 100 PY) 
(Shah 2017).  Among patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD), including CD and ulcerative colitis, the incidence rate (per 
100 PY) was 0.94 for serious infections (Kirchgesner 2018).  
Integrated risankizumab clinical trial data was used to assess the 
risk with risankizumab therapy, and epidemiologic data were used 
to contextualize the risankizumab data.
Risk factors and risk groups
The elderly and patients with other risk factors compromising 
immunity such as diabetes or chronic renal insufficiency are at 
increased risk.

risk with risankizumab therapy.
Risk factors and risk groups
Multiple factors may contribute to an increased rate of malignancy 
in patients with psoriasis and/or Crohn's Disease, including the 
effects of immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies.  
Psoralen and ultraviolet A, when given long term, is associated with 
increased risks of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and 
malignant melanoma.  Reviews of studies on ultraviolet B, both 
narrowband and broadband, do not indicate any increased risk of 
non-melanoma skin cancer or melanoma (Patel 2009).  The 
traditional systemic therapies, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, and 
mycophenolate mofetil, may be associated with an increased risk of 
lymphoproliferative disorders during treatment, demonstrated in 
clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's 
disease documented in case reports concerning psoriasis patients 
The risk of malignancy with biologic therapy is still unclear.  
However, the majority of the studies examining this carcinogenic 
risk suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors may cause a 
slightly increased risk of cancer, including non-melanoma skin 
cancer and hematologic malignancies.

the individual biologic labels.  Integrated risankizumab clinical trial 
data was used to assess the risk with risankizumab therapy.
Risk factors and risk groups
Several factors influence the propensity towards development of 
hypersensitivity reactions including degree of humanization of the 
antibody, cell line from which the drug is obtained (Chinese hamster 
ovary [CHO] cells produce virtually no 1,3-galactosyltransferase,

resulting in a glycosylation pattern much different from that of other 
drugs such as cetuximab [derived from the murine cell line SP2/O], 
thereby reducing the risk of hypersensitivity reactions) and the 
excipients used (Corominas 2014).  Host factors include the 
indication for the treatment (e.g., atopic tendencies in patients with 
asthma), patient's immune status, concomitant medications.

Long-Term Prospective Cohort Study in Patients with Psoriasis in Real World Setting
A prospective cohort study of population-based patients in the real-world is being conducted to 
monitor the incidence of safety outcomes coincident with exposure to risankizumab in patients 
with psoriasis (which includes patients with arthropathic psoriasis [ICD-10-CM L40.5x]) in 
two European national registers with linkage data from national quality registers.  The aim of 
Study P19-633 is to estimate the risks of overall malignancy excluding NMSC, NMSC, MACE, 
serious infections, and serious hypersensitivity reactions among individuals who were exposed 
to risankizumab for the treatment of psoriasis, relative to similar patients on other systemic 
treatments (biologics and non-biologics).  In addition, a separate cohort study will be 
conducted (synopsis below) to assess pregnancy exposures and outcomes utilizing large 
electronic healthcare databases with mother-baby linkage in the United States.
Pregnancy Exposure and Outcomes in Women with Psoriasis Treated with 
Risankizumab
A population-based, non-interventional, cohort study of women with moderate-to-severe 
psoriasis (which includes patients with arthropathic psoriasis [ICD-10-CM L40.5x]) who are 
exposed to risankizumab or comparator biologic during pregnancy is ongoing.  The specific 
objectives of Study P16-751 are (1) to evaluate the rate of major congenital malformations in 
infants born to women exposed to risankizumab during pregnancy compared to those exposed 
to comparator treatments (primary outcome for sample size estimation); (2) to evaluate and 
compare pregnancy outcomes (i.e., live birth, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, 
stillbirth) among women exposed to risankizumab versus comparators during pregnancy; and 
(3) to assess and compare additional infant outcomes (premature birth, small for gestational 
age, neonatal deaths, serious infections up to 6 months of age) among infants born to women 
exposed to risankizumab during pregnancy compared to those exposed to other biologic 
treatments.  Adult women of child-bearing years with moderate-to-severe psoriasis will serve 
as the study population.  There will be 3 specific cohorts of women included in this study:  
1) women exposed to risankizumab but not exposed to other biologic therapies at any time 
during pregnancy (risankizumab-exposed cohort);  2) women exposed to an anti-TNF, IL-17 
79

Version 4.6/ Data Lock Point 20 May 2021
biologics or their biosimilars for moderate-to-severe psoriasis at any time during pregnancy 
(comparator biologic-exposed cohort); and, 3) women with psoriasis who received no psoriasis 
therapy, or treatment for psoriasis other than risankizumab or comparator biologics (e.g., 
phototherapy or nonbiologic therapy).  This untreated psoriasis group was chosen to serve as a 
frame of reference and provide context to the rates of outcomes observed in the risankizumab-
exposed and comparator biologic-exposed groups.  This study will be conducted using 
administrative claims data in the Innovation in Medical Evidence Development and Surveillance 
System (IMEDS) Distributed Databases (IMEDS-DD).
Risankizumab Long-Term Extension Study (Psoriasis)
A multicenter, open-label study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of risankizumab in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing.  The primary objective of 
Study M15-997 is to investigate long-term safety (including the safety concerns e.g., MACE, 
malignancies, serious infections and serious hypersensitivity reactions) and tolerability of 
risankizumab in subjects with psoriasis who have completed one of the preceding Phase 2/3 
studies.  The secondary objective of Study M15-997 is to investigate the long-term efficacy of 
risankizumab in the treatment of psoriasis.
Risankizumab Psoriatic Arthritis Studies
Study M15-998 is a 2-part, multicenter study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of 
risankizumab in subjects with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis who have a 
history of inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1 disease-modifying anti-rheumatic 
drug or to biologic therapy(ies).  The primary objective of the open-label period of the study is 
to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg in subjects 
who have completed the double-blind period of the study.
Study M16-011 is a 2-part, multicenter study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of 
risankizumab with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis who have a history of 
inadequate response to or intolerance to at least 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug 
therapy.  The primary objective of the open-label period of the study is to evaluate the long-
term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg in subjects who have completed 
the double-blind period of the study.

exposure in pregnant patients with Crohn's disease, and compare pregnancy and infant 
outcomes to pregnant patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with alternative 
therapies.  In addition, descriptive analyses of pregnancy outcomes in patients with Crohn's 
disease without exposure to any treatments under investigation will also be conducted.
Study Population:  Women of child-bearing age with Crohn's disease will comprise the study 
population.  Patients (with age per labeled indication) who have filled at least one prescription 
for risankizumab or comparator treatment and are considered to be exposed to treatment 
during pregnancy will be included in the study.  The study will be conducted within the network 
of administrative claims data with mother-baby linkage within the FDA Sentinel Distributed 
Database.
Long-Term Comparative Cohort Study in Patients with Crohn's Disease in a Real 
World Setting
Study Short Name and Title:  A comparative cohort study of long-term safety of risankizumab 
in patients with Crohn's disease (Study P23-654)
Rationale and Study Objectives:  The clinical trial program was not able to fully characterize 
the safety profile of risankizumab in the Crohn's disease population.  Additional long-term data 
are needed from the real-world experience of patients with Crohn's disease treated with 
risankizumab to assess product potential risks.
Study Design:  A comparative cohort study will be conducted to estimate rates of malignancy 
(malignancy excluding NMSC, NMSC), serious infections, serious hypersensitivity reactions, and 
MACE in risankizumab treated patients with Crohn's disease, relative to alternative systemic 
therapies (e.g., biologics).  The study will be conducted within the Swedish Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Register (SWIBREG) in Sweden and the National Registers within Sweden and 
Denmark.  Validated disease and outcome definitions, and appropriate methods for 
confounding control will be utilized.
Study Population:  All patients with Crohn's disease (with age per labeled indication) who have 
filled at least one prescription for risankizumab or comparator treatment will be identified in 
the data source after a specified start date and included in the study.

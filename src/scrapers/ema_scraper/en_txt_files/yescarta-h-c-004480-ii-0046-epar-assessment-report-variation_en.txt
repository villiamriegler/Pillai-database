2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  
Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) represents a subset of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) 
and includes both diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (including DLBCL not otherwise specified 
[NOS]) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is proposed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B cell lymphoma (HGBL). 
Following the first round of responses to the RfSI, the MAH modified the intended indication as follows: 
Yescarta is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who 
are refractory or have relapsed within 12 months from completion of first-line therapy. 
EMA/804955/2022

Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) comprises a heterogeneous group of cancers originating primarily in B 
lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, in T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. NHL is the most prevalent 
hematological malignancy and is the seventh most common new cancer, accounting for 4% of all new 
cancer cases and 3% of cancer related deaths in the US. In Europe, NHL is the 12th most common new 
cancer, accounting for 3% of all new cancer cases and 3% of cancer related deaths. 
LBCL is an aggressive subset of B-cell NHL, representing 30% to 40% of NHL cases. The most common 
LBCL subtype is DLBCL (including DLBCL not otherwise specified [NOS]), which accounts for more than 
80% of LBCL cases. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced HGBL as a new category 
of LBCL. HGBL represents up to 13% of LBCL cases. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
LBCL subtypes include DLBCL NOS (defined by exclusion of unique features and further divided 
according to cell of origin types, germinal center B cell [GCB] and activated B cell [ABC]), and other 
disparate DLBCL entities with unique clinical and pathological features such as primary DLBCL of the 
central nervous system (CNS); primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type; Epstein Barr virus positive (EBV+) 
DLBCL NOS; EBV+ mucocutaneous ulcer; DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation; and T 
cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL. LBCL also includes DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (FL), but this 
subtype is not included in the WHO 2016 categorization due to the classification being based on the 
investigator’s assessment of the clinical history of FL and not solely on histopathology. HGBL comprises 
2 subcategories: 1) HGBL with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements, which is also known as 
double- or triple-hit lymphoma and excludes FL or lymphoblastic lymphoma; and 2) HGBL NOS, which 
includes LBCL that are “high-grade” and would be previously characterized as B cell lymphoma 
unclassifiable, and lack genetic features of double- or triple hit lymphomas. 
Management 
The  current  standard  of  care  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  DLBCL  is  the  chemotherapeutic  regimen 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) in combination with the anti-CD20 
monoclonal antibody rituximab (R-CHOP). Treatment with this regimen resulted in 5-year and 10-year 
event-free survival (EFS) rates of 47% and 35%, respectively, and 5-year and 10-year overall survival 
(OS) rates of 58% and 44%, respectively in patients 60 to 80 years of age. For patients 18 to 60 years 
of age treated with R-CHOP, 3-year EFS and OS rates are 79% and 93%, respectively. While R-CHOP 
has improved outcomes for patients with DLBCL overall, about 10% to 15% of patients have primary 
refractory disease and a further 20% to 40% of patients have disease that relapses. 
The optimal therapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HGBL has not been established. A dismal 
prognosis  has  been  reported  for  patients  with  HGBL  treated  with  various  chemoimmunotherapy 
regimens,  and  there  is  no  consensus  whether  regimens  more  intensive  than  R-CHOP  are  required. 
Retrospective  data  with  more  intensive  regimens  such  as  dose-adjusted  rituximab  plus  etoposide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (DA-EPOCH-R)  have shown benefit, and 
have  also  been  reported  as  first-line  treatment  for  HGBL.  A  recent  retrospective  analysis  suggests 
rituximab plus etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisolone (R-EPOCH) may 
not  improve  survival  outcomes  compared  with  R-CHOP  (4-year  OS  rates  of  49.6%  and  54.5%, 
respectively). 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 10/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Standard  second-line  therapy  in  the  curative  setting  for  LBCL  is  comprised  of  rituximab  and 
platinum-containing salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem 
cell transplant (auto-SCT) for those who are eligible. Five-year EFS rates of 46% and OS rates of 53% 
in patients with r/r NHL have been reported for subjects who received the definitive treatment (salvage 
chemotherapy and HDT-auto-SCT). The efficacy of this regimen has not been fully assessed for HGBL 
due to conflicting data from several studies. 
While  HDT-auto-SCT  has  curative  potential,  only  half  of  patients  respond  to  second-line  salvage 
chemotherapy and are able to proceed to auto-SCT. Other reasons for not undergoing HDT-auto-SCT 
include failure to mobilize CD34+ stem cells for auto-SCT, poor performance status, organ dysfunction, 
comorbidities,  unresolved  treatment-emergent  toxicities,  or  age  (HDT-auto-SCT  is  typically  only 
recommended  for  patients  younger  than  60  to  70 years  of  age,  depending  on  regional  guidelines). 
Furthermore, disease progression can occur at any point preparing for or after auto-SCT and an increased 
risk  of  death  is  associated  with  auto-SCT  due  to  early  transplant-related  mortality.  Secondary 
malignancies,  including  treatment-related  myelodysplastic  syndrome  and  treatment-related  acute 
myeloid leukemia, are also associated with HDT-auto-SCT. 
Outcomes are particularly poor for patients who have primary refractory disease or early relapse after 
first-line  therapies;  further,  most  of  these  patients  are  not  eligible  for  transplant  due  to  their 
chemotherapy-resistant  disease.  Published  objective  response  rates  (ORRs) 
to  second-line 
chemotherapy in patients with refractory or early relapse disease range from 14% to 55%. For patients 
who  do  not  respond to  salvage  chemotherapy,  a  median  OS of  4.4 months has  been  reported  in  one 
study. 
Outcomes are also poor for patients with higher second-line age-adjusted International Prognostic Index 
(sAAIPI) scores. Studies have reported significantly higher 3-year EFS for patients with an sAAIPI of 0 
or  1 factors  compared  with  those  who  had  2  or  3 factors  (40%  versus  18%,  respectively),  and 
significantly improved OS and progression-free survival (PFS). A retrospective study demonstrated 4-
year  PFS  rates  for  patients  with  low  risk  (0 factors),  intermediate  risk  (1 factor),  and  high-risk  (2  or 
3 factors) sAAIPI of 70%, 39%, and 16%, respectively, and 4-year OS rates of 74%, 49%, and 18%, 
respectively. 
More  recently,  2  therapies  were  conditionally  approved  in  the  EU  for  treating  transplant-ineligible 
patients with r/r DLBCL, and although these new treatment options offer incremental improvements in 
response  rates  for  selective  patients,  neither  therapy  has  demonstrated  curative  outcome.  These 
therapies  are  tafasitamab,  an  anti-CD19  antibody,  in  combination  with  lenalidomide,  with  conditional 
approval based on results from a Phase 2 study and polatuzumab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate 
comprising a monoclonal antibody against CD79b conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E, in combination 
with bendamustine and rituximab, with conditional approval based on results from a Phase 1b/2 study.  
In summary, many patients do not benefit from current standard of care second-line therapy. Although 
higher risk is associated with disease that is refractory or relapses within 12 months of first-line 
therapy, only 10% of all patients with r/r LBCL are estimated to have long-term survival following 
auto-SCT in the rituximab era. Thus, a need remains for alternative second-line therapies, including 
those with a mechanism of action independent of chemotherapy sensitivity. 
2.1.1.  About the product 
Axicabtagene  ciloleucel  is  an  anti-CD19  chimeric  antigen  receptor  (CAR)  T-cell  product  manufactured 
from a patient’s own T cells that are obtained by leukapheresis and transduced with a murine γ retroviral 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 11/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
vector to deliver an anti-CD19 CAR transgene, resulting in expression of the anti-CD19 CAR protein on 
the surface of the patient’s engineered T cells. These engineered T cells are then introduced back into 
the patient via a single intravenous infusion and target the B cell marker, CD19. 
The anti-CD19 CAR consists of a murine single-chain antibody fragment that specifically binds human 
CD19; the partial extracellular domain (hinge) and complete transmembrane and intracellular signaling 
domains of human CD28, a lymphocyte costimulatory receptor that plays an important role in optimizing 
T-cell survival and function; and the cytoplasmic portion, including the signaling domain, of human CD3ζ, 
a component of the T-cell receptor complex. After engagement of the anti-CD19 CAR with CD19+ target 
cells, the CAR intracellular domains trigger a dual signaling cascade that leads to CAR T-cell activation, 
proliferation,  and  secretion  of  cytokines,  chemokines,  and  other  molecules  that  recruit  and  activate 
additional antitumor immune cells and results in tumor cell lysis. 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel has demonstrated the capacity to prolong survival as a third-line treatment for 
heavily  pretreated  patients  whose  disease  was  refractory  to  second-line  therapy,  and  may  present  a 
favorable efficacy and tolerability profile as a second-line therapy. Since patients with r/r LBCL who are 
refractory to or relapse early after first-line chemotherapy may also be resistant to second-line or beyond 
chemotherapy, they may benefit from receiving therapies such as CAR T-cell therapy that have different 
mechanisms  of  action  earlier  in  their  treatment.  Thus,  administration  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  as  a 
second-line therapy may result in further improvement in its efficacy and tolerability profile in patients 
with disease that failed first-line therapy, and particularly for patients with prognostic factors indicating 
they might respond poorly to second-line standard of care therapy (SOCT). 
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In the EU, in accordance with Article 3(1) − Indent 1a − Advanced therapy medicinal product as defined 
in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007, axicabtagene ciloleucel falls within the mandatory scope 
of the centralized procedure. Eligibility to the centralized procedure was confirmed by the Committee for 
Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (CHMP)  on  26 May 2016  and  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  assigned 
the product reference H0004480. 
Protocol assisstance for axicabtagene ciloleucel has been sought from the CHMP on 4 occasions, which 
are listed below. In general, CHMP advice has been followed throughout the development program.

2.1.3.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
No changes have been proposed as part of this extension of indication for manufacturing of the 
medicinal product. The product specifications remain the same.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CAT. The environmental risk of axicabtagene ciloleucel is not affected by the proposed extension of

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells), pharmacodynamics (levels of serum analytes), 
other biomarkers, and product characteristics of axicabtagene ciloleucel were included as exploratory 
endpoints of ZUMA-7. 
Methods 
Subject samples were collected on the protocol-specified study visits (ie, Treatment days 0, 1, 3, and 
7, with days relative to the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel on Treatment day 0; and on Study Days 
50, 100, and 150 postrandomization, with days relative to the day of randomization on Study Day 0). 
Results were mapped to assessment time points that more accurately characterize pharmacokinetic 
and pharmacodynamic profiles and associations with clinical outcomes after treatment rather than 
EMA/804955/2022

after randomization to the study (ie, Treatment days 0, 1, 3, and 7, Weeks 2 and 4, and Months 3, 6, 
9, 12, 18, and 24 post-treatment).  
The pharmacokinetic profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in blood was assessed by means of measuring 
the presence, expansion, and persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells at multiple time points after cell 
infusion. Serial blood samples were taken after cell infusion and subjected to a validated quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for the measurement of levels of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The 
qPCR assay was based on the method developed by Kochenderfer and colleagues {Kochenderfer 2012, 
Kochenderfer 2015, Kochenderfer 2017a} and was further optimized and validated by the University of 
Rochester Medical Center, Central Laboratory Services (University of Rochester Medical Center, Central 
Lab Services).  
The maximum observed number of anti-CD19 CAR T cells/μg (ie, peak anti-CD19 CAR T cells/μL), the 
area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the level of anti-CD19 CAR T cells from infusion to Week 4 postinfusion 
(AUC0-28), time-to-peak for anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and the persistence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells over 
time in blood were determined for subjects with evaluable samples. Due to the timing of samples 
collected after infusion, the calculated values for peak, AUC0-28, and time-to-peak are considered 
estimates. The lower limit of detection (the sensitivity of quantitative detection of CAR T-cell signal 
above background at a level of precision acceptable for quantitation) was established at 1 anti-CD19 
CAR T cell equivalent per 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) was established at 8 to 110 cell equivalents per 100,000 PBMCs depending on 
DNA sample load. 
Analyses of the pharmacokinetics assessments were performed on samples from subjects randomized 
to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel and who received at least 1 dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel (safety 
analysis set). 
Pharmacokinetics results 
Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood 
Anti-CD19 CAR T cells were measurable in the peripheral blood of 162 evaluable subjects within the 
first 28 days after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 
25.84 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) and median AUC0-28 was 236.23 cells/μL•days (range: 
0.00 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days). The median time-to-peak was calculated as 8 days (range: 2 to 233 
days) (ie, 7 days after the day of axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion). By Month 3, median levels of anti-
CD19 CAR T cells decreased towards baseline in evaluable subjects (0.35 cells/μL; range: 0.00 to 
28.44 cells/μL) but were still detectable in 12 out of 30 evaluable subjects until 24 months post 
treatment.

1. 
Data cutoff date = 18MAR2021. 
Abbreviations: CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; Q, quartile. 
Note. Only subjects in axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included. 
One subject had a time-to-peak of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level 233 days after the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion. The late peak calculated for this subject was due to there being no sample available 
between Day 1 and Month 3. The value of CAR T cells/μL of blood at 233 days for this subject was low 
(< 1 cell/µL) and consistent with the overall pharmacokinetic profile across the study. 
Special populations 
ZUMA-7 was not designed to test for differences between subgroups and formal comparisons were not 
prespecified. The statistical results of the subgroup analyses are considered descriptive only. Subjects 
in which peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 could not be derived were excluded from the 
respective summary statistics.  
Age 
Per protocol, all subjects were age ≥ 18 years. A total of 121 subjects were < 65 years of age and 
49 subjects were ≥ 65 years of age.  
Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 23.45 cells/μL (range: 0.09 to 622.50 cells/μL) in subjects 
< 65 years of age and 34.80 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in subjects ≥ 65 years of age. 
The median AUC0-28 was 218.84 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) in subjects < 65 
years of age and 445.11 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in subjects ≥ 65 
years of age. The median time-to-peak was 8 days for both subjects < 65 and ≥ 65 years of age. 
Sex 
A total of 106 subjects were male and 64 subjects were female.

The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 25.84 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 622.50 cells/μL) in 
female subjects and 25.70 cells/μL (range: 0.30 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in male subjects. The median 
AUC0-28 was 243.60 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) in female subjects and 
236.23 cells/μL•days (range: 4.02 × 10-3 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in male subjects. The median 
time-to-peak was 8 days for both female and male subjects. 
Race 
A total of 138 subjects were White, 11 subjects were Asian, 9 subjects were Black or African American, 
and 12 subjects self-reported their race as other (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American 
Indian or Alaska Native, and “other” according to the electronic case report form).  
Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 83.11 cells/μL (range: 8.41 to 622.50 cells/μL) in Asian 
subjects, 53.04 cells/μL (range: 0.41 to 276.28 cells/μL) in subjects self-reporting as other, 40.39 
cells/μL (range: 0.55 to 198.99 cells/μL) in Black or African American subjects, and 22.68 cells/μL 
(range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in White subjects. The median AUC0-28 was 1059.21 cells/μL (range: 
67.01 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) in Asian subjects, 586.03 cells/μL•days (range: 5.30 to 3759.66 
cells/μL•days) in subjects self-reporting as other, 534.55 cells/μL (range: 0.01 to 2564.74 
cells/μL•days) in Black or African American subjects, and 192.81 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 
1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in White subjects. The median time-to-peak was 8 days for all race groups. 
Ethnicity 
A total of 159 subjects were not Hispanic or Latino and 8 subjects were Hispanic or Latino. Subjects 
with ethnicity data not reported were excluded from the analysis. 
Median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 26.24 cells/μL (range: 2.75 to 276.28 cells/μL) in 
Hispanic or Latino subjects and 25.52 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in not Hispanic or 
Latino subjects. The median AUC0-28 was 421.40 cells/μL•days (range: 22.38 to 3759.66 cells/μL•days) 
in Hispanic or Latino subjects and 232.38 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in 
not Hispanic or Latino subjects. The median time-to-peak was 8 days for both ethnicity groups. 
Baseline tumor burden 
Tumor burden was defined as the sum of the product of the longest diameters (SPD) of selected nodes 
or lesions using central assessment. Subjects without baseline tumor burden measurement were 
excluded from the analysis.  
The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 values were similar between quartiles. The 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 23.46 cells/μL in the first (lowest) tumor burden 
quartile, 33.72 cells/μL in the second quartile, 27.11 cells/μL in the third quartile, and 30.71 cells/μL in 
the fourth (highest) quartile. Median values for AUC0-28 were 276.50 cells/μL•days in the first quartile, 
248.53 cells/μL•days in the second quartile, 314.73 cells/μL•days in the third quartile, and 240.08 
cells/μL•days in the fourth quartile.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized for 2 subgroups of subjects (n=77 per group) with 
baseline tumor SPD ≤ median as compared to subjects with SPD > median. The median peak anti-
CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 25.52 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 459.76 cells/μL) in subjects with baseline 
tumor SPD ≤ median and 29.03 cells/μL (range: 0.55 to 1173.25 cells/μL) for subjects with baseline 
tumor SPD > median. The median AUC0-28 was 264.68 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 
6223.76 cells/μL•days) for subjects with baseline tumor SPD ≤ median and 281.45 cells/μL•days 
(range: 0.01 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) for subjects with baseline tumor SPD > median. The median 
time-to-peak was 8 days for all subgroups.

both subjects with an ECOG score of 0 and 1. 
Response to first-line therapy (refractory/relapsed subgroup) 
Using data derived from the clinical database for response to first-line therapy, 124 subjects were 
primary refractory to the first-line therapy, 26 subjects relapsed ≤ 6 months of completion of first-line 
therapy, and 20 subjects relapsed > 6 and ≤ 12 months of completion of first-line therapy.  
Median peak anti -CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 27.38 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in 
subjects who were primary refractory to the first-line therapy, 15.66 cells/μL (range: 0.55 to 276.28 
cells/μL) in subjects who relapsed ≤ 6 months of completion of first-line therapy, and 25.14 cells/μL 
(range: 0.41 to 459.76 cells/μL) in subjects who relapsed > 6 and ≤ 12 months of completion of 
first-line therapy. The median AUC0-28 was 279.16 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 1.65 × 104

expressor lymphoma, and. The median time-to-peak was 8 days in subjects with HGBL double-hit or 
triple-hit, double-expressor lymphoma, and MYC rearrangement. 
CD19 positive status 
A total of 136 subjects were CD19 IHC positive (CD19+) and 13 subjects were CD19 IHC negative 
(CD19−). CD19+ is defined as having an H-score ≥ 5. Subjects with missing CD19 H-scores were 
excluded from the analysis. 
The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were 25.52 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 622.50 cells/μL) in 
CD19+ subjects and 22.62 cells/μL (range: 1.50 to 1173.25 cells/μL) in CD19- subjects. The median 
AUC0-28 was 222.51 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) in CD19+ subjects and 
300.90 cells/μL•days (range: 5.17 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in CD19- subjects. The median time-
to-peak was 8 days in both subgroups (CD19+ and CD19− subjects). 
CD19 positive/negative status after disease progression was reported for 7 subjects. Three of 
7 subjects were CD19− after disease progression.

Association between pharmacokinetic profile and clinical response outcomes 
Event-free survival 
The primary efficacy endpoint was event-free survival (EFS) with progression events and censoring 
using blinded central assessment. EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of 
disease progression per Lugano Classification {Cheson 2014}, commencement of new lymphoma 
therapy, or death from any cause.  
Of the 81 subjects who had > median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels, 44 subjects (54%) had an EFS 
event and 37 subjects (46%) were censored (did not have an EFS event or were lost to follow-up). Of 
the 81 subjects who had ≤ median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 52 subjects (64%) had an EFS event 
and 29 subjects (36%) were censored.  
A possible association between peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and EFS was observed when peak 
anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were categorized as ≤ median versus > median (hazard ratio 
[HR] stratified: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.99; stratified 1-sided log-rank 
p = 0.0210). A trend was also observed between AUC0-28 and EFS (HR stratified: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.51, 
1.16), but the stratified 1-sided log-rank p-value was 0.1010. 
Objective response 
Among 170 subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, 149 subjects were responders (CR or partial 
response [PR]) and 21 subjects were nonresponders (stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]).  
Responders had numerically higher median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 levels compared 
with nonresponders. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 28.94 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 
1173.25 cells/μL) for responders versus 10.45 cells/μL (range: 0.09 to 622.50 cells/μL) for 
nonresponders (p = 0.0224). The median AUC0-28 was 292.86 cells/μL•day (range: 0.00 to 1.65 × 104

Data cutoff date 18MAR2021. Abbreviation: AUC, area-under-the-curve; CAR, chimeric antigen 
receptor.  
Notes: Responders are defined as subjects experiencing best response of partial or complete response; 
nonresponders are defined as subjects experiencing best response of stable or progressive disease. 
Peak is defined as the maximum number of CAR T cells in blood measured after the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion. AUC is defined as the AUC in a plot of number of CAR T cells in blood against 
scheduled visit from Treatment day 0 to Week 4 post-treatment. Values of 0.001 in the Y-axis indicate 
values of zero. Only subjects in axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included.  
Best overall response 
Among 162 evaluable subjects, 109 subjects achieved a best response of CR, 33 subjects achieved a 
best response of PR, and 20 subjects had a best response of SD or PD (nonresponders).  
Subjects whose best response was CR had numerically higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 
levels compared with subjects whose best response was PR or subjects who were nonresponders. The 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 32.33 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 276.28 cells/μL) for 
subjects who achieved CR, 22.30 cells/μL (range: 0.41 to 1173.25 cells/μL) for subjects who achieved 
PR, and 10.45 cells/μL (range: 0.09 to 622.50 cells/μL) for nonresponders (p = 0.0501). The median 
AUC0-28 was 322.18 cells/μL•day (range: 0.00 to 3759.66 cells/μL•days) for subjects who achieved CR, 
279.16 cells/μL•day (range: 5.30 to 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) for subjects who achieved PR, and 
70.14 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) for nonresponders (p = 0.0201).  
Boxplots for peak level and AUC0-28 by best response category (CR, PR, or nonresponders) are

Data cutoff data = 18MAR2021. Abbreviation: AUC, area-under-the-curve; CAR, chimeric antigen 
receptor; CR, complete response; PR, partial response. 
Notes: Nonresponders are defined as subjects experiencing best response of stable or progressive 
disease. Peak is defined as the maximum number of CAR T cells in blood measured after the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. AUC is defined as the AUC in a plot of number of CAR T cells in blood 
against scheduled visit from Treatment day 0 to Week 4 post-treatment. Values of 0.001 in the Y-axis 
indicate values of zero. Only subjects in axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included.  
Ongoing response 
Among 154 evaluable subjects, 70 subjects were in ongoing response (defined as ongoing or complete 
or partial responses at data cutoff), 64 subjects had relapsed, and 20 subjects had no response.  
Comparable anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 levels were observed between subjects who were 
in ongoing response and subjects who had relapsed, while the values were lower in subjects with no 
response. Specifically, the median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 29.68 cells/μL (range: 0.55 to 
276.28 cells/μL) in subjects with ongoing response, 27.44 cells/μL (range: 0.04 to 1173.25 cells/μL) 
for relapsed subjects, and 10.45 cells/μL (range: 0.09 to 622.50 cells/μL) in subjects with no response. 
The p-value for the overall comparison of peak values was p = 0.0713. The median AUC0-28 was 
276.88 cells/μL•days (range: 4.02 × 103, 3759.66 cells/μL•days) in subjects with ongoing response, 
313.23 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00, 1.65 × 104 cells/μL•days) in relapsed subjects (p = 0.7190), and 
70.14 cells/μL•days (range: 0.00 to 8541.63 cells/μL•days) in subjects with no response. The p-value 
for the overall comparison of AUC0-28 values was p = 0.0205. Notably, AUC0-28 was associated with 
ongoing response compared with nonresponse (p = 0.0250) and with relapsed disease compared with 
nonresponders (p = 0.0199).  
OS 
Of the 81 subjects who had > median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels, 31 subjects (38%) had an OS 
event (ie, death) per central assessment and 50 subjects (62%) were censored (did not have an OS 
event or were lost to follow-up). Of the 81 subjects who had ≤ median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 31 
subjects (38%) died and 50 subjects (62%) were censored.  
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 21/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
No association between peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and OS was observed when peak anti-CD19 
CAR T-cell levels were categorized as ≤ median versus > median (HR stratified: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.51, 
1.40; stratified 1-sided log-rank p = 0.2537). Also, no association was observed between AUC0-28 and 
OS (HR stratified: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.46; stratified 1-sided log-rank p = 0.3018).  
Modified EFS 
Modified EFS (mEFS) was defined the same way as EFS, except that SD as the best response by the 
Study Day 150 assessment was not considered an event. 
Of the 81 subjects who had > median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 43 subjects (53%) had an event and 
38 subjects (47%) were censored (did not have an event or were lost to follow-up). Of the 81 subjects 
who had ≤ median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 49 subjects (60%) had an event, and 32 subjects 
(40%) were censored.  
An association between peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and mEFS was observed when peak anti-
CD19 CAR T-cell levels were categorized as ≤ median versus > median (HR stratified: 0.70; 95% 
CI: 0.46, 1.07; stratified 1-sided log-rank p = 0.0471). A similar trend was observed between AUC0-28 
and mEFS (HR stratified: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.24), although the stratified 1-sided log-rank p-
value was 0.1682. 
Progression-free survival 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the randomization date to the date of 
disease progression or death from any cause per blinded central assessment. Subjects not meeting the 
criteria by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date 
prior to the data cutoff date or new lymphoma therapy start date (including stem cell transplant in the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm or retreatment of axicabtagene ciloleucel), whichever was earlier.  
Of the 81 subjects who had > median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 40 subjects (49%) had an event and 
41 subjects (51%) were censored (did not have an event or were lost to follow-up). Of the 81 subjects 
who had ≤ median anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level, 43 subjects (53%) had an event, and 38 subjects 
(47%) were censored.  
An association between peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and PFS was observed when peak anti-CD19 
CAR T-cell levels were categorized as ≤ median versus > median (HR stratified: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.44; 
1.06; stratified 1-sided log-rank p = 0.0443). However, an association was not observed between 
AUC0-28 and PFS (HR stratified: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.26; stratified 1-sided log-rank p = 0.1737). 
Association between pharmacokinetics and safety outcomes 
Association of pharmacokinetic parameters with CRS 
Among 170 subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, 11 subjects had Grade 3 or higher CRS (10 
subjects with evaluable samples for peak CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 analyses) and 159 subjects had 
Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS (152 subjects with evaluable samples for peak CAR T-cell levels and 
AUC0-28 analyses).  
Numerically higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 levels were observed with Grade 3 or higher 
CRS, although there was no strong association. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 2.08-
fold higher for subjects with Grade 3 or higher CRS compared with subjects with Grade 2 or lower CRS 
(52.05 versus 25.04 cells/μL; p = 0.2040). The median AUC0-28 was 1.77-fold higher for subjects with 
Grade 3 or higher CRS compared with subjects with Grade 2 or lower CRS (402.41 versus 
227.45 cells/μL•days; p = 0.2494).

Association of pharmacokinetic parameters with neurologic events 
Among 170 subjects who received axicabtagene ciloleucel, 36 subjects had Grade 3 or higher 
neurologic events (33 subjects with evaluable samples for peak CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 
analyses), and 134 subjects had Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events (129 subjects with 
evaluable samples for peak CAR T-cell levels and AUC0-28 analyses).  
Higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell peak and AUC0-28 levels were associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
events. The median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell level was 2.60-fold higher for subjects with Grade 3 or 
higher neurologic events compared with subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic events 
(57.93 versus 22.30 cells/μL; p = 0.0006). The median AUC0-28 was 3.43-fold higher for subjects with 
Grade 3 or higher neurologic events compared with subjects with Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic 
events (601.99 versus 175.44 cells/μL•days; p = 0.0004).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Methods 
Serum analytes: 
The serum analytes evaluated are known to be involved in mediating the antitumor activity of CAR 
T cells and treatment-related toxicity {Brudno 2018, Kochenderfer 2013, Kochenderfer 2017a, Neelapu 
2017}. Levels of analytes (proinflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines, chemokines, effector 
molecules, and angiogenesis and acute phase proteins) were evaluated in serum samples at multiple 
time points. If the subject experienced a Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related toxicity 
such as Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurologic event, one additional blood draw for 
cytokines was to be taken at the time of the Grade 3 or higher axicabtagene ciloleucel-related toxicity 
and upon resolution of the event. Due to the timing of samples collected after infusion, the calculated 
values for peak, AUC, and time-to-peak are considered estimates. 
Levels of the following 29 serum analytes are presented: 
•  Homeostatic/proliferative: interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, and IL-15 
• 
Inflammatory/immune-modulating: IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα), 
IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 P40, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 
(GM-CSF) 
•  Chemokine: C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) 10 (also known as interferon [IFN]-γ -induced protein-
10 (IP-10), IL-8, IL-17, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 (also known as C-C motif 
chemokine ligand [CCL]2), MCP-4, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), macrophage 
inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) 
• 
Immune effector: granzyme B, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α 
•  Acute phase proteins: C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and serum amyloid A (SAA) 
•  Other analytes: intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-
1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
• 
IL-23 was evaluated but had no detectable values within the quantitative range and is therefore 
not described 
Exploratory associations described are based on nominal Wilcoxon rank-sum p ≤ 0.05. Multiplicity 
adjustment was not performed; therefore, p-values do not indicate statistical significance but rather a 
trend in association between analytes and treatment-related toxicity.

CFS analytes: 
Levels of analytes (proinflammatory and immune-modulating cytokines, chemokines, effector 
molecules, and angiogenesis and acute phase proteins) were evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
samples collected when subjects had new onset Grade 2 or higher neurologic symptoms after 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. Due to the timing of samples collected after infusion, the calculated 
values for peak, AUC, and time-to-peak are considered estimates. 
Postbaseline levels of the following 40 CSF analytes are presented: 
•  Homeostatic/proliferative: IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 
• 
Inflammatory/immune-modulating: eotaxin (also known as CCL11), eotaxin-3 (also known as 
CCL26), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2Rα, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 P40, IL-12 P70, IL-13, IL-16, 
IL-17, GM-CSF, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1), soluble Fas ligand, and 
TNF-β 
•  Chemokine: CXCL10 (IP-10), IL-8, MCP-1 (also known as CCL2), MCP-4, MDC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, 
and TARC (also known as CCL17) 
• 
Immune effector: granzyme A, granzyme B, IFN-γ, perforin, and TNF-α 
•  Acute phase proteins: CRP, ferritin, and SAA 
•  Other analytes: ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 
B-cell evaluations: 
To monitor the on-target/off-tumor effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel on CD19-expressing B cells, the 
presence and percentage of CD19+, CD20+, or CD19+CD20+ B cells in cryopreserved PBMCs were 
evaluated by a flow cytometry assay. Results are presented as the percentage of B cells in viable 
CD45+ leukocytes. The limit of detection and LLOQ were determined to establish the sensitivity of the 
assay. This assay does not distinguish between normal and malignant CD19+ B cells. 
Product T cell phenotype and Markers of T-cell exhaustion in product: 
T cell phenotype (CCR7 Vs CD45RA) and exhaustion markers (e.g. PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) with respect to 
both CAR+/- populations were assayed in the products. Viable CD3+ T cells from cryopreserved 
preinfusion axicabtagene ciloleucel product retains were immunophenotyped at the single cell level, 
using specific antibody panels in multiparametric flow cytometry.  
Pharmacodynamics results 
Pharmacodynamics in serum 
Key observations included the following:  
•  On Treatment day 0, after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and on the day of the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion, median serum levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 increased by ≥ 2-fold and median 
serum levels of granzyme B, IL-12 P40, IL-17, and MDC decreased by ≥ 2-fold relative to baseline 
levels. Median serum levels of the other 23 analytes had < 2-fold change after lymphodepletion 
relative to baseline. 
•  On Treatment day 1 after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, median serum levels of 6 of 29 
analytes had ≥ 2-fold increase from Treatment day 0: IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17. 
Also, 9 of 29 analytes had a ≥ 2-fold increase on Treatment day 1 relative to baseline (IFN-γ, IL-2, 
IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and SAA), while granzyme B and MDC had a ≥ 2-fold 
decrease on Treatment day 1 relative to baseline. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 24/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
•  On Treatment day 3 after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, median serum levels of 18 of 29 
analytes had < 2-fold change relative to baseline, while 10 analytes were elevated by ≥ 2-fold 
relative to baseline (CRP, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and SAA). On 
Treatment day 3, MDC was decreased by ≥ 2-fold relative to baseline, but this was likely due to 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Also, compared with Treatment day 0, median serum levels on 
Treatment day 3 had < 2-fold change in 19 of 29 analytes, while 11 analytes were elevated by 
≥ 2-fold (CRP, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 P40, IL-17, SAA, and TARC). 
•  On Treatment day 7 after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, median serum levels of 14 of the 29 
analytes had < 2-fold change relative to baseline, while 14 analytes were elevated by ≥ 2-fold 
relative to baseline (CRP, CXCL10, ferritin, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2 Rα, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-10, IL-15, SAA, and TARC). On Treatment day 7, MDC was decreased by ≥ 2-fold relative to 
baseline, but this was likely due to lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Also, compared with Treatment 
day 0, median serum levels on Treatment day 7 had < 2-fold change in 16 of 29 analytes, while 13 
analytes were elevated by ≥ 2-fold (CRP, CXCL10, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2 Rα, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, SAA, and TARC). On Treatment day 7, MCP-1 was decreased by ≥ 2-fold 
relative to Treatment day 0. 
• 
The median time-to-peak for 19 of 29 analytes was 8 days (ie, 7 days after infusion of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel). The median time-to-peak was 1 day for IL-4; 2 days for GM-CSF, IL-2, 
IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and MIP-1β; 4 days for SAA; and 5 days for MCP-4. Most analytes were 
elevated by ≥ 2-fold at peak compared with baseline in ≥ 50% of subjects (exceptions: ICAM-1, 
IL-4, IL-7, IL-12 P40, MCP-4, MDC, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF-α, VCAM-1, and VEGF). 
•  By Week 4 post-treatment, the majority of the serum analytes had returned to near baseline 
levels; 9 of 29 analytes remained elevated by 2-fold or more in ≥ 20% of subjects (CXCL10, 
ferritin, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-17). 
Pharmacodynamics in CSF 
Analytes in the CSF were analyzed following treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel in subjects who 
had Grade 2 or higher neurologic events (n = 13).  
All subjects had detectable levels of the following CSF analytes: CRP, CXCL10, eotaxin-1, ferritin, 
ICAM-1, IL-1 RA, IL-2Rα, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1β, PD-L1, TARC, TNF-α, and VCAM-1. Eight of the 40 
analytes were below the limit of quantification (granzyme A, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12 P40, IL-12 P70, 
IL-13, MDC and TNF-β). 
B-cell recovery in blood 
In the safety analysis set, 81 of 141 tested subjects had detectable B cells at baseline (before initiation 
of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion), with a median B-cell level of 
0.27% of viable leukocytes (range: 0.02% to 32.18%). At Month 3, the first time point at which B cells 
were measured after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, 52 of 138 tested subjects had detectable B cells, 
and the median B-cell level was 0.37% (range: 0.02% to 24.51%). With limited evaluable samples (n 
= 17), there was an indication of some B-cell recovery at Month 6, when the majority of samples still 
had undetectable B cells, but among the 7 subjects with detectable B cells, the median value was 
4.02% (range: 0.04% to 23.00%). B cell recovery was clearer at Month 9 with the majority of subjects 
presenting detectable B-cell levels and a median detectable level of 9.79%. Recovery continued 
through Month 24, at which time 22 of 26 evaluable subjects had detectable B cells.

•  Other CAR+ subsets reported values < 1% of total T-cell populations. 
Association of serum pharmacodynamic parameters with CRS 
Of the 29 serum analytes, the peak levels for the following analytes were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) 
among subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS (n = 11) versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS 
(n = 159) after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CXCL10, ferritin, GM-CSF, granzyme B, ICAM-1, IL-
2Rα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and VCAM-1. The following analytes presented nominally higher 
(p ≤ 0.05) in AUC values among subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or higher CRS versus Grade 2, 
Grade 1, or no CRS after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: ferritin, GM-CSF, granzyme B, IL-2Rα, IL-
6, IL-15, IL-17, and VCAM-1. CXCL10, ICAM-1, MCP-1, and IL-10 had nominally higher peak levels but 
not nominally higher AUC values. In addition, VEGF presented nominally higher in AUC, but not 
nominally higher in peak levels in subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS. 
At baseline, the serum levels for the following analytes were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) among 
subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS after infusion of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel: IL-2Rα, IL-15, TNF-α, and VCAM-1. 
At Treatment day 0, the serum levels for the following analytes were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) 
among subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS after 
infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: IL-2Rα, MCP-4, MDC, and VCAM-1. 
The 3 analytes with the greatest fold change in median peak serum levels by grade of CRS were: 
• 
IL-6 (median ratio: 3.5) 
•  GM-CSF (median ratio: 3.4) 
• 
IL-10 (median ratio: 3.0) 
Association of serum pharmacodynamic parameters with neurologic events 
Of the 29 analytes, the median peak levels for the following analytes were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) 
among subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or higher neurologic event (n = 36) versus Grade 2, 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 28/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Grade 1, or no neurologic event (n = 134) after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CXCL10, ferritin, 
GM-CSF, granzyme B, ICAM-1, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2Rα, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and VCAM-1. The 
following analytes presented nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) in AUC values among subjects who 
experienced a Grade 3 or higher neurologic event versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic event 
after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CXCL10, ferritin, GM-CSF, granzyme B, ICAM-1, IFN-γ, IL-
2Rα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, and VCAM-1. IL-2 and IL-5 had nominally higher peak levels but not nominally 
higher AUC values. 
At baseline, the serum levels of only VCAM-1 were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) among subjects who 
experienced a Grade 3 or higher neurologic event versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic event 
after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
At Treatment day 0, the serum levels for the following analytes were nominally higher (p ≤ 0.05) 
among subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or higher neurologic event versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no 
neurologic event after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CRP, ICAM-1, IL-2Rα, IL-15, SAA, and 
VCAM-1. 
The 4 analytes with the greatest fold change in median peak serum levels by grade of neurologic 
events were: 
• 
• 
IL-6 (median ratio: 2.4) 
IL-10 (median ratio: 2.3) 
•  GM-CSF (median ratio: 2.2) 
• 
IL-5 (median ratio: 2.2) 
Association of CSF pharmacodynamic parameters with neurologic events 
Levels of 40 analytes in the CSF were evaluated for potential associations with grade of neurologic 
events following treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel. CSF Samples and data were available for only 
13 subjects (6 subjects who had Grade 3 or higher neurologic events and 7 subjects who had Grade 2 
or lower neurologic events). Accordingly, there is limited insight from the results.  
The following CSF analytes had median values that were ≥ 2-fold higher among subjects who 
experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic event versus subjects who experienced Grade 2, Grade 1, or 
no neurologic event after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel: CRP, ferritin, granzyme B, IFN-γ, IL-2Rα, 
MCP-1, and SAA. Also, CRP, ferritin, granzyme B, IFN-γ, and IL-2Rα had a maximum value that was 
higher among subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic event compared with subjects 
who experienced a Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic event.  
Association of product characteristics and clinical efficacy 
A possible trend towards higher ORR (95% versus 80%, respectively) was observed for subjects whose 
products had a higher percentage (> the median value) of CD3+ cells compared with those whose 
products had a lower percentage (≤ the median percentage) of CD3+ cells. The reverse trend was 
observed for the percentage of CD3− cells, with a lower ORR (80% versus 95%, respectively) observed 
for subjects whose products had a higher percentage of CD3− cells compared with those whose 
products had a lower percentage CD3− cells. 
A possible trend towards higher best overall response of CR (78% versus 57%, respectively) was 
observed for subjects whose products had a higher percentage (> the median value) of CD3+ cells 
compared with those whose products had a lower percentage (≤ the median percentage) of CD3+ cells. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 29/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The reverse trend was observed for the percentage of CD3− cells, with a lower best overall response of 
CR (57% versus 78%, respectively) observed for subjects whose products had a higher percentage of 
CD3− cells compared with those whose products had a lower percentage of CD3− cells. 
Across all other product characteristic subgroups, the median best overall response of CR ranged from 
59% to 76% and were generally consistent with the median best overall response of CR of 68% for the 
overall population. 
A possible trend towards higher ongoing response rate at data cutoff (55% versus 31%, respectively) 
was observed for subjects whose products had a higher percentage (> the median value) of Tnaïve cells 
compared with those whose products had a lower percentage (≤ the median percentage) of Tnaïve cells. 
The reverse trend was observed for the percentage of Tem cells, with a lower ongoing response rate at 
data cutoff (32% versus 55%, respectively) observed for subjects whose products had a higher 
percentage of Tem cells compared with those whose products had a lower percentage of Tem cells. 
Across all other product characteristic subgroups, the ongoing response rates ranged from 35% to 
52% and were generally consistent with the ongoing response rate of 44% for the overall population at 
data cutoff.  
Association of product characteristics and safety outcomes 
Preinfusion product characteristics were evaluated in subgroup analyses for the following treatment-
emergent AE (TEAE) categories within the safety analysis set: all TEAEs, serious TEAEs, TEAEs and 
serious TEAEs deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel, CRS, neurologic events, serious neurologic 
events, cytopenias by lineage (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia), infections, and serious 
infections. 
The following key trends were observed for associations of product characteristics with TEAEs of 
interest: 
•  A higher incidence of Grade 3 or higher CRS was observed in subjects who received products that 
produced higher levels of IFN-γ (12% versus 1%, respectively). 
•  Higher incidences of Grade 3 or higher CRS or neurologic events were observed in subjects who 
were infused with a higher total number of Tem plus Teff (CCR7−) cells (31% versus 14%) or 
products that produced higher levels of IFN-γ (33% versus 15%). 
•  Higher incidences of Grade 3 or higher neurologic events were observed in subjects who were 
infused with a higher total number of Tem cells (27% versus 13%), a higher total number of Tem 
plus Teff (CCR7−) cells (30% versus 10%), or products that had a higher percentage of Teff cells 
(27% versus 13%). 
•  Higher incidences of Grade 3 or higher serious neurologic events were observed in subjects who 
were infused with a higher total number of CD3 cells (19% versus 8%), a higher total number of 
CD8 cells (19% versus 8%), a higher total number of Tem plus Teff (CCR7−) cells (22% versus 6%), 
or products that produced higher levels of IFN-γ (21% versus 9%). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results on axicabtagene ciloleucel measurables and clinical 
parameters on safety and efficacy are in line with current scientific knowledge on the pharmacology of 
CAR T cells. The pharmacokinetic profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel in the ZUMA-7 trial presents a rapid 
expansion of CAR T cells peaking on Day 8 followed by a rapid contraction up to Week 4 and subsequent 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 30/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
low level persistence up to 18 to 24 months, consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile observed in the 
other trials with these CAR-T cells. The median time-to-peak was 8 days for all subgroup populations. 
CAR T-cell expansion was associated with efficacy endpoints, and the pharmacokinetic associations with 
toxicity are consistent with previous observations with axicabtagene ciloleucel. There is no sex or age 
related difference in the median time-to-peak of 8 days. In addition, the median peak anti CD19 CAR T-
cell levels are similar and not influenced by age or sex. Interestingly, there is no significant difference in 
median peak anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels and median time-to-peak between CD19 positive and negative 
patients. 
Higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were associated with subjects who were responders compared with 
subjects who were nonresponders. Median anti-CD19 CAR  T cell peak and AUC0-28 were numerically 
higher in subjects whose best response was CR compared with subjects whose best response was PR. 
Higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels in blood were associated with Grade 3 or higher neurologic events. 
Higher anti-CD19 CAR T-cell levels were observed in subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS. 
Quantification of serum analytes revealed a rapid and transient increase in several proinflammatory and 
immune-modulatory analytes following infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel, which is consistent with the 
known  mechanism  of  action  of  anti-CD19  CAR  T-cell  therapy.  The  median  time-to-peak  for  19  of  29 
serum analytes was 8 days (ie, 7 days after the day of the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion). The median 
time-to-peak was 1 day  for IL-4; 2 days for GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and MIP-1β; 4 
days for SAA; and 5 days for MCP-4. By Week 4 post-treatment, the majority of the serum analytes had 
returned to near baseline levels. Of the 29 serum analytes, the peak levels for the following analytes 
were nominally higher (nominal Wilcoxon rank sum p ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced Grade 3 
or higher CRS (n = 11) versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no CRS (n = 159) after infusion of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel: CXCL10, ferritin, GM-CSF, granzyme B, ICAM-1, IL-2Rα, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1, and 
VCAM-1.  Of  the  29  serum  analytes,  the  peak  levels  for  the  following  analytes  were  nominally  higher 
(nominal Wilcoxon rank sum p ≤ 0.05) among subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or higher neurologic 
event (n = 36) versus Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic event (n = 134) after infusion of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel: CXCL10, ferritin, GM-CSF, granzyme B, ICAM-1, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-2Rα, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, 
and  VCAM-1.  CSF  levels  of  CRP,  ferritin,  granzyme  B,  IFN-γ,  IL-2Rα,  MCP-1,  and  SAA  were  ≥  2  fold 
higher among subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher neurologic event (n = 6) versus subjects who 
experienced Grade 2, Grade 1, or no neurologic event (n = 7) after infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Before lymphodepleting chemotherapy and axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion (baseline), B-cell levels were 
generally low (possibly due to first-line therapy, R-CHOP) with median levels < 1% of total leukocytes 
(median  =  0.27),  but  detectable  in  the  majority  of  subjects  (81  of  141  tested  subjects).  After 
axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion, at Month 3, B-cell levels were undetectable in most subjects (86 of 138 
tested subjects) and generally demonstrated recovery by Month 9 in subjects with evaluable samples. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results are presented extensively throughout the 
documentation. These results correlate well to previous observations with axicabtagene ciloleucel and 
are in line with the current scientific knowledge for the pharmacology characteristics of CAR T cells.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
A  Phase  3,  Randomized,  Open-Label  Study  Evaluating  the  Efficacy  of  Axicabtagene  Ciloleucel  versus 
Standard of Care Therapy in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (ZUMA-
7) 
Methods 
ZUMA-7 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel  versus  SOCT  in  adult  subjects  with  r/r  LBCL.  Adult  subjects  with  r/r  LBCL  after  first-line 
rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene 
ciloleucel or SOCT. Randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, 
relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy, or relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and sAAIPI 
(0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening. 
For subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, treatment consisted of lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
followed by a single intravenous infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Bridging therapy of corticosteroids 
was  allowed  prior  to  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  for  subjects  with  high  disease  burden,  at  the 
discretion of the investigator. For subjects in the SOCT arm, treatment consisted of a single protocol-
defined,  platinum-based  salvage  chemotherapy  regimen  as  selected  by  the  treating  investigator. 
Subjects who responded to salvage chemotherapy were to proceed to HDT with or without total body 
irradiation (TBI), followed by auto-SCT. 
Disease  response  and  progression  were  evaluated  per  the  Lugano  Classification  {Cheson  2014},  by 
blinded central assessment and by the investigator. Subjects in both treatment arms were to be assessed 
for response and progression at the same times relative to randomization (Study Day 0): Study Days 
50, 100, 150, and Month 9, then every 3 months thereafter until Month 24, and then every 6 months 
from Months 30 to 60. For a subject who completed the long-term follow-up period, the study was to 
take  approximately  5  or  15  years  to  complete  as  determined  by  randomization  to  the  SOCT  or 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arms, respectively. 
The  primary  analysis  of  EFS  was  conducted  on  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  defined  as  all  randomized 
subjects,  and  according  to  the  randomized  treatment  regardless  of  whether  study  treatment  was 
received, when all subjects had the opportunity to be followed for the Month 9 disease assessment (ie, 
the Month 9 timepoint had passed for all subjects) and 250 EFS events by blinded central assessment 
had been observed. 
Study participants 
Approximately 350 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or SOCT. 
Randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, relapse ≤ 6 months 
of first-line therapy, or relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted 
IPI (0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening. 
Key eligibility criteria included the following: 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 32/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Histologically  proven  LBCL  including  the  following  types  defined  by  the  WHO  in  2016  {Swerdlow 
2016}: 
  DLBCL not otherwise specified (including ABC/GCB)

  Relapsed disease defined as complete remission to first-line therapy followed by biopsy-proven 
disease relapse ≤ 12 months of therapy. 
  Refractory  disease  defined  as  no  complete  remission  to  first-line  therapy;  subjects  who  were 
intolerant to first-line therapy were excluded. 
•  Received adequate first-line therapy including at a minimum: 
  Anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  unless  the  investigator  determined  the  tumor  was  CD20 
negative, and 
  An anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen 
•

•  Had radiographically documented disease 
•  No known history or suspicion of central nervous system involvement by lymphoma 
•  At least 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever was shorter, had elapsed since any prior systemic cancer 
therapy at the time the subject provided consent 
•  Age 18 years or older at the time of informed consent 
Treatments 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel arm:  
Axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  administered  after  a  3-day  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  regimen 
consisting of fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/day, followed by 2 rest days. 
A  single  infusion  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  administered  intravenously  at  a  target  dose  of 
2 x 106 anti-CD19  CAR  T cells/kg  (minimum  dose  of  1 x 106 anti-CD19  CAR  T  cells/kg;  for  subjects 
weighing > 100 kg, the maximum flat dose was 2 x 108 anti-CD19 CAR T cells). 
Bridging  therapy  with  corticosteroids  was  allowed  prior  to  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  at  the 
discretion of the investigator for disease temporalization, but chemoimmunotherapy was not allowed as 
bridging  therapy  because  of  possible  disease-modifying  effects  that  would  confound  the  short-  and 
longterm  disease  assessments  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm.  Bridging  therapy  was  to  consist  of 
corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone at a dose of 20 to 40 mg or equivalent, either orally [PO] or IV daily 
for 1 to 4 days) administered after leukapheresis through 5 days before administration of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. 
SOCT arm:  
Protocol-defined salvage chemotherapy regimens were: R-ICE, R-DHAP/R-DHAX, R-ESHAP, or R-GDP as 
selected  by  the  treating  investigator,  administered  every  2  to  3 weeks  for  2  to  3 cycles.  Subjects 
responding  to  salvage  chemotherapy  after  2  or  3 cycles  were  to  proceed  with  HDT-auto-SCT  per 
institutional  or  regional  standards.  Subjects  not  responding  to  salvage  chemotherapy  could  receive 
additional treatment off protocol.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine if axicabtagene ciloleucel is superior to SOCT as measured by 
EFS, as determined by blinded central assessment. 
Key secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with SOCT on 
ORR  (determined  by  blinded  central  assessment),  OS,  PFS  (determined  by  investigator  assessment),

Sample size 
The study was planned to have an overall alpha of 2.5% with 1-sided testing. To preserve the overall 
significance level, statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints was to follow 
a hierarchical testing scheme of EFS, followed by ORR and then OS (see “Statistical Methods” below). 
Overall 350 subjects were planned to be randomized (175 subjects per arm). 
An EFS hazard ratio (test/control arm) of 0.67 was hypothesized in the FAS set, which corresponds to 
a median EFS of 4 versus 6 months (control vs test arm). The primary analysis was planned when 250 
EFS events had been observed; the study was been sized to achieve approximately 90% power at the 
1-sided 2.5% significance level to detect a 50% improvement in EFS. The EFS analyses was planned 
as event-driven and was to occur when the required number of events have been observed. 
For the analysis of ORR, response rates of 36% and 78% in the control and test arms were assumed. 
ORR was to be tested with a stratified (randomization factors) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test at the 
2.5% level among subjects with measurable disease at baseline.  
An OS hazard ratio of 0.73 was hypothesized in the FAS set, which corresponds to a median OS of 
15.8 versus 21.6 months (control vs test arm). The primary OS analysis was planned when 
approximately 210 deaths had been observed, but no later than 5 years after the first subject was 
randomized. Two interim analyses were planned for OS with the first interim analysis occurring at the 
time of primary EFS analysis and the second interim analysis when approximately 160 deaths have 
been observe, but no later than 4 years after the first subject was randomized. 
Randomisation 
Once eligibility into the study had been confirmed, subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or investigator choice of standard of care chemotherapy as assigned by 
the interactive voice/web response system (IXRS). Randomization was to be stratified by response to 
first-line therapy (primary refractory, vs relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy vs relapse > 6 and ≤ 
12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted IPI (0 to 1 vs 2 to 3) as assessed at the 
time of screening. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  was  planned  as  an  open-label  study  where  subjects  and  investigators  were  aware  of  the 
treatment received. Disease response and progression were evaluated per the Lugano Classification, by 
blinded central assessment and by the investigator. 
Data handling procedures were to be devised to reduce potential sources of bias and maintain the 
validity and credibility of the study. These procedures were to be outlined in the study statistical 
analysis plan and Trial Integrity Document (TID). According to the TID, biostatisticians and 
biostatistical programmers from the sponsor had access to the restricted data at all time. However, 
access of the Sponsor’s team to treatment allocation (and to corresponding variables such as choice of 
standard of care treatment, leukapheresis, etc) was seemingly restricted with no exceptions for 
specific functions (“Subject level assigned treatment arm and treatment actually received (…) will be 
restricted to the sponsor”). Furthermore, medical monitors, safety monitors, clinical operations 
managers were granted access to restricted subject level data. 
The DSMB was to review safety data every 6 months from the time the first subject is randomized until 
the primary EFS analysis. Additionally, the DSMB was to review safety and efficacy data at the time of 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 35/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
the planned interim EFS analysis. The DSMB was tasked to also review SAE information and SUSARs 
on a regular basis throughout the study.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary analysis of all efficacy endpoints was to be conducted in the FAS, defined as all 
randomized subjects according to the ITT principle.  
The safety analysis set was defined as the subset of all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of axicabtagene ciloleucel or standard of care chemotherapy and a safety ASCT analysis set was 
defined as the subset of subjects randomized to the SOCT arm who underwent transplant as part of 
protocol therapy. Subjects were to be analyzed according to the treatment received. 
The primary analysis of HRQoL was to be performed on the subset of subjects in the FAS who have a 
baseline and at Day 150 post-randomization assessment.  
Primary endpoint 
EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per Lugano 
Classification (Cheson et al, 2014), commencement of new lymphoma therapy, or death from any 
cause.  For the primary analysis of EFS, disease progression events and censoring times were 
determined by blinded central review. Details for the definition of EFS events and timing, and 
censoring times were defined in the study protocol.  
A stratified (randomization stratification factors) log-rank test was to be used for the primary 
comparison of EFS. Additionally, stratified (randomization stratification factors) Cox regression models 
were to be used to provide the estimated EFS hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to SOCT. The median EFS time and event-free rates at 3-month 
intervals were to be provided.  
Sensitivity analyses were to be performed using the actual stratification factor values, in which the 
strata for relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy and relapse from 6 to 12 months of first-line therapy 
were determined based on the time of completion of the first-line therapy (rather than time of 
initiation or completion). Further sensitivity analyses of EFS were to be performed to assess 
ascertainment time bias in disease progression: Progression events that occurred between scheduled 
assessments were to be moved forward to the next schedule assessment after / before the observed 
progression, and EFS events that occurred after more than one missed visit were to be censored at the 
last evaluable disease assessment or visit prior to the observed progression. Additionally, a sensitivity 
analysis in which subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm who underwent SCT while in an 
axicabtagene ciloleucel induced response were to be considered to have had an EFS event on the date 
of SCT. EFS based on investigator disease assessments was to be analyzed with the same methods as 
EFS. 
Key secondary endpoints 
ORR was defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a partial response by the Lugano 
Classification (Cheson et al, 2014) as determined by blinded central review. All subjects who did not 
meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cutoff date were to be considered non-
responders. Disease assessments obtained after randomization and up to an observation of 
progression per Lugano Classification were to be used. Derivation of best response was to include all 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 36/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
assessments until an EFS event, including any assessments obtained after SCT for the SOCT arm. 
Testing of ORR was to be performed with a stratified (randomization factor) Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
test for the common odds ratio of response. An exact binomial 2-sided 95% confidence interval was to 
be generated for the objective response rates and best response rates for each treatment arm. 
Wilson’s score method with continuity correction will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for 
the difference in objective response rates between treatment arms (Newcombe 1998). 
OS was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Subjects who have not died 
by the analysis data cutoff date were to have survival time censored at their last date known to be 
alive. For subjects alive or dead after the data cutoff date, survival time was to be censored at the 
data cutoff date. A stratified (randomization stratification factors) log-rank test was to be used for the 
primary comparison of OS. Additionally, a stratified (randomization factor) Cox regression model was 
to be used to provide the estimated OS hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. 
Multiplicity control (over endpoints) 
To preserve the overall significance level, statistical testing of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints was to follow a hierarchical scheme (see also Figure 4). EFS was to be tested first at the 
primary EFS analysis. Conditional on a statistically significant improvement in EFS, ORR was to be 
tested at the 2.5% level at the time of the primary EFS analysis. Conditional on a statistically 
significant improvement in EFS and ORR, OS was be tested up to 3 times at an overall 1-sided alpha 
level of 2.5% (see description of interim analyses below). 
Figure 4. Study Testing Scheme 
Interim analyses 
One interim analysis of EFS and 2 interim analyses of OS were planned.  
The interim EFS analysis was for futility and was to occur when 135 EFS events had been observed. An 
O’Brien-Fleming spending function of the Lan-DeMets family was to be used to allocate the type II 
error between the interim and primary analyses. The futility stopping rule was non-binding. Under the 
null hypothesis, the probability of stopping for futility at this interim analysis was approximately 60%. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 37/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The required 135 EFS events were anticipated to occur approximately 19 months after the first subject 
was randomized. The primary analysis of EFS was to be conducted when all randomized subjects had 
had the opportunity to be followed to the Month 9 disease assessment and 250 EFS events as 
determined by blinded central review had been observed. If more than 250 EFS events were observed 
at the time of the data cutoff for the primary analysis, all observed events were to be used in the 
analysis. Prior to the primary efficacy analysis, modeling and monitoring of cumulative EFS events was 
to be performed to determine a data cutoff date to achieve the planned analysis target event goal. 
Conditional upon statistically significant tests of EFS and ORR, testing of OS was to be performed. Two 
interim analyses of OS were to occur, a first at the time of the primary EFS analysis and a second 
when approximately 160 deaths had been observed or no later than 4 years after the first subject was 
randomized. A spending function of the Rho family (Kim & DeMets 1987) with parameter (rho = 6) was 
to be used to allocate the alpha between the 2 interim analyses of OS and the primary analysis of OS. 
Approximately 110 OS events were anticipated at the time of the interim OS analysis 1, and 160 at the 
time of the second OS interim. The primary analysis of OS was to occur when approximately 210 
deaths have been observed or no later than 5 years after the first subject is randomized. The protocol 
stated that, based on the alpha spending function and projected event rates, alpha was to be allocated 
as 0.1% (IA1), 0.4% (IA2), and 2% for the primary analysis of OS. Notably, this is not in line with the 
defined spending function, which would have led to an allocation of 0.05% (IA1), 0.5% (IA2), and 
2.4% (primary analysis).

Recruitment 
Conduct of the study 
Study protocol amendments 
The original protocol, dated 22 May 2017, was amended 6 times in the US; for all other regions, the 
protocol  was  amended  5  times.  However,  no  subjects  were  treated  until  Amendment  2  (dated  21 
November  2017)  and  therefore,  changes  made  before  and  in  Amendment  2  are  not  provided  here. 
Amendment  3  was  not  submitted  to  any  IRBs  or  ECs,  as  well  as  any  ex-US  health  authorities  (HA); 
therefore, all changes made in Amendment 3 and Amendment 4 were implemented in, and described 
below  under,  Amendment  4.  Major  changes  after  protocol  Amendment  4  and  for  all  subsequent 
amendments are also summarized below. Amendment 5 was submitted to and approved by HAs, IRBs 
and ECs outside of the US; no subjects were enrolled under this amendment in the US. Amendment 5.1 
was subsequently submitted to and approved by the FDA and IRBs/ECs in the US. 
Amendment 4: 19 March 2019 
•  Broadened the definition of the time point from which the period of relapse is determined for the 
stratification factors from “relapse ≤ 6 months of initiating first-line therapy” and “relapse > 6 
and ≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to “relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy” and 
“relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation 
or completion of first-line therapy. 
•  Broadened the definition of the time point from which progression is determined for the inclusion 
sub-criterion “partial response (PR) as best response after at least 6 cycles and biopsy-proven 
residual disease or disease progression” from “≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to “≤ 
12 months of first-line therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation or completion of first-
line therapy. 
•  Broadened the definition of the time point from which the period of relapse is determined for the 
inclusion  sub-criterion  “relapsed  disease  defined  as  complete  remission  to  first-line  therapy 
followed by biopsy-proven disease relapse” from “≤ 12 months of initiating first-line therapy” to 
“≤ 12 months of firstline- therapy,” where “of” indicates either from initiation or completion of 
first-line therapy. 
•  Updated  the  inclusion  criteria  to  maintain  alignment  with  the  WHO  lymphoid  malignancy 
categories,  wherein  changes  made  in  2016  led  to  the  recognition  of  DLBCL  subtypes  of  T-
cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma, EBV+ DLBCL, and primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type 
as unique entities and the HGBL category was created {Swerdlow 2016}. Therefore, inclusion 
criteria  were  updated  from  DLBCL  including  transformation  from  FL  to  LBCL  including  DLBCL, 
NOS; HGBL with or without MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement; DLBCL arising from FL; 
T-cell/histiocyte-rich  large  B-cell  lymphoma;  DLBCL  associated  with  chronic  inflammation; 
primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg type; and EBV+ DLBCL.

•  Clarified the required duration of subject observation after axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion was 
to be aligned with country-specific requirements.  
•  Aligned requirements for initiating leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion and retreatment with the axicabtagene ciloleucel clinical study program. 
•  Clarified  the  duration  of  the  period  for  collecting  information  for  concomitant  therapy  was  to 
include targeted concomitant therapies from Study Day 150 until Month 12, and that recording 
of this information stopped at Month 12, change in lymphoma therapy, or disease progression, 
whichever came first. 
•  Updated that PET-CTs were to continue through Month 9 or until a change in lymphoma therapy 
or  disease  progression,  whichever  came  first.  Clarified  that  imaging  follow-up  was  to  be 
performed for subjects who discontinued protocol therapy due to an assessment of PD, but for 
whom there was no change in lymphoma therapy. Clarified that subjects for whom CT scans with 
contrast were contraindicated were to undergo MRI with contrast in addition to noncontrast CT 
scans. 
•  Clarified that samples of apheresis and final product were to be retained and tested to understand 
the mechanism of action and safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
•  Updated  the  SOA  tables  (for  both  treatment  arms)  to  include  respiratory  rate  as  a  vital  sign 
procedure and the WPAI:GH was added to the Therapy days –5 and 0 assessments to align with 
collection of the other PROs. The axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment arm SOA was updated with 
an additional blood draw for PBMCs at Treatment day 3 and the mini-mental state examination 
was removed as a mandatory part of the neurologic assessment. The SOCT arm SOA table was 
updated with additional blood draws at Cycle 1 and Study Days 50, 100, and 150 and for long-
term follow-up assessments at Months 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60. 
•  Added 3 timepoints for PRO assessment (Months 18, 21, and 24) to the long-term follow-up  
•  Updated the AE reporting period to post-randomization through Study Day 150 or a change in 
lymphoma therapy, whichever occurred first 
•  Updated the SAE reporting period to after signing of the informed consent through the Study 
Day  150  visit  or  until  initiation  of  a  new  lymphoma  therapy,  whichever  occurred  first.  The 
reporting period for targeted SAEs was updated to 5 years for the SOCT arm and 15 years for 
the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, or until disease progression, whichever occurred first.  
•  Described  the  reporting  requirements  for  deaths  to match  the  current  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
clinical study program 
Amendment 5 (current protocol version for ex-US HAs and IRBs/ECs): 25 June 2020 
•  Modified the primary EFS analysis event trigger from 270 to approximately 250 EFS events with 
an acceptable lower limit for the observed total EFS events of 225, which was to maintain the 
power for the primary analysis to within 5% of the targeted 90%. 
• 
Increased the required duration of follow-up for the primary analysis of EFS from the Study Day 
150 assessment to the Month 9 assessment 
•  Added a second interim OS analysis and a sensitivity analyses of OS. The second interim analysis 
of OS was to occur when approximately 160 deaths have been observed or no later than 4 years 
after  the  first  subject  is  randomized.  The  sensitivity  analyses  were  added  to  address  the 
confounding effect from treatment switching. 
•  Added  a  time  frame  for  the  primary  analysis  of  OS  so  that  it  was  to  occur  either  when 
approximately 210 deaths have been observed or no later than 5 years after the first subject 
was randomized. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 41/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
•  Added TTNT as an exploratory endpoint 
• 
Provided guidance for sites to encourage collection of a biopsy confirming disease progression 
and to submit the biopsied tissue to the central laboratory 
•  Updated  the  revised  pregnancy  and  lactation  reporting  language  to  be  consistent  with  EU 
requirements and to align across Kite programs 
•  Clarified  the  TEAE  definition  as  any  AE  that  begins on  or  after  the  first  dose study  treatment 
(axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion or standard of care salvage chemotherapy), to be in alignment 
with the definition used in other Kite studies. 
Amendment 5.1 (US only): 16 September 2020 
•  Reference to an acceptable lower limit for the observed total EFS events to trigger the primary 
analysis was removed at the request of the FDA 
•  Removed “approximately” from the 250 events required to trigger the primary analysis at the 
request of the FDA 
Changes in Planned Analyses 
The following changes in analyses or additional analyses occurred after SAP finalization: 
• 
The primary EFS analysis was planned to occur after 250 EFS events had been observed in the 
study. Because the time to reach 250 EFS events was longer than estimated, the first interim 
OS analysis was conducted at 153 events instead of the planned 110 events. As a result, the 
interim OS analysis conducted at 153 events meets the criteria for both originally planned interim 
OS analyses at 110 and 160 events. The only subsequent planned OS analysis will be the primary 
(final) OS analysis, expected to occur when 210 events are observed or no later than 5 years 
after the first subject is randomized. 
• 
PFS  based  on  central  assessment  was  analyzed  with  the  same  methods  per  investigator 
assessment, as well as in subgroups defined by the baseline characteristics in Section 7.7.10.2. 
and presented in data tables. 
•  Modifications  within  some  categories  of  baseline  characteristics  and  subgroup  covariates 
occurred. 
•  HDT-related  TEAEs  (for  the  SOCT  arm)  are  provided  in  data  tables  in  addition  to  the  SAP-
specified salvage chemotherapy-related and auto-SCT-related TEAE tables. 
The following clarifications to definitions were made after SAP finalization: 
•  Concordance between EFS determined by central and investigator assessment was determined 
using EFS events instead of progression events. 
• 
Therapy day 0 is used in select data tables and listings in the following instances: 
o  When referring to the day of administration of the first dose of salvage chemotherapy in 
the SOCT arm 
o 
In tables, listings, and narratives that use one term to refer to the day of administration 
of the first dose of either axicabtagene ciloleucel in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm or 
salvage chemotherapy in the SOCT arm. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 42/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
• 
The definition of the QoL analysis set in the data tables was aligned with the definition provided 
in the Supplemental PRO  SAP as subjects who had a baseline and at least 1 completed post-
randomization measurement through the Study Day 150 visit 
The definition of bone marrow failure was aligned with the axicabtagene ciloleucel Investigator’s 
Brochure and is therefore not identified as a potential risk of axicabtagene ciloleucel 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Subject demographics were generally comparable between the 2 treatment arms. The median age was 
59  years  (range:  21  to  81  years),  and  109  subjects  (30%)  were  ≥  65  years  of  age.  The  majority  of 
subjects were male (237 subjects, 66%) and White (297 subjects, 83%). Most subjects were randomized 
in North America (270 subjects, 75%), of whom the majority were in the US (250 subjects, 70%). Of 
the  subjects  randomized  in  Europe  (79  subjects,  22%),  most  subjects  were  in  the  Netherlands  (25 
subjects, 7%). 
Treatment  arms  were  generally  well-balanced,  but  a  difference  of  ≥  10%  was  observed  between  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms for sex (male: 61% versus 71%, respectively).

Table 2. Demographics (FAS) 
Baseline and disease characteristics 
Overall,  baseline  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  the  2  treatment  arms.  As 
categorized by the investigator, the most common disease type for subjects in both the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and SOCT arms were DLBCL, NOS (110 of 180 subjects [61%] and 116 of 179 subjects [65%], 
respectively), HGBL with or without MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement (43 subjects [24%] and 
27  subjects  [15%],  respectively),  and  large  cell  transformation  from  FL  (19  subjects  [11%]  and  27 
subjects  [15%],  respectively).  Forty-four  subjects  (24%)  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  and  35 
subjects (20%) in the SOCT arm had double-expressor lymphoma as reported by the investigator. 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 44/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disease subtypes were defined differently by the central laboratory than by the investigator; DLBCL NOS 
was considered a diagnosis of exclusion per the central laboratory; cases of incomplete evaluation (eg, 
inadequate samples or sample types, or lack of clinical history such as the location of the tumor) were 
considered  by  the  central  laboratory  to  be  DLBCL  without  further  classification  of  subtype  possible. 
Subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms were categorized as DLBCL NOS/without further 
classification  possible  (126  subjects  [70%]  and  120  subjects  [67%],  respectively);  HGBL  with  MYC, 
BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements (31 subjects [17%] and 25 subjects [14%], respectively) or HGBL, 
NOS, (1 subject [1%] in the SOCT arm); the remaining subjects were categorized under not confirmed, 
missing, or other. 
Per the randomization stratification factor of response to first-line therapy as collected in the IxRS, the 
majority  of  subjects  had  primary  refractory  disease  (133  subjects  [74%]  and  131  [73%]  in  the 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  SOCT  arms,  respectively).  Similar  percentages  of  subjects  with  primary 
refractory disease were derived from the clinical database (133 subjects [74%] and 132 subjects [74%] 
in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  SOCT  arms,  respectively)  but  the  percentages  of  subjects  whose 
disease relapsed ≤ 6 months or > 6 to ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy differed between the IxRS and 
the derived data due to a protocol change that broadened the definition of the time point from which the 
period of relapse is determined.  
Per the randomization stratification factor of sAAIPI score as collected in the IxRS, approximately half of 
subjects had an sAAIPI score of 0 or 1 (98 subjects [54%] and 100 subjects [56%] in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and SOCT arms, respectively). The percentage of subjects with sAAIPI scores of 0 or 1 were 
similar  when  derived  from  the  clinical  database  (94  subjects  [52%]  and  100  subjects  [56%]  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms, respectively). In the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms, 
the  relevant  components  of  sAAIPI  were  elevated  LDH  levels  (101  subjects  [56%]  and  94  subjects 
[53%], respectively), stage III/IV disease (139 subjects [74%] and 146 subjects [82%], respectively), 
and ECOG performance status > 1 (which did not apply to any subjects as, per protocol inclusion criteria, 
all subjects 
(100%) had an ECOG score of 0 or 1). 
In addition, 62% of subjects had extranodal disease, with some variability (≥ 10% differences) observed 
between the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms (57% versus 67%, respectively).

Baseline  characteristics  and  prior therapies  for  the  FAS  were  generally  similar  to  those  for  the  safety 
analysis set. Baseline characteristics for subjects who received auto-SCT in the SOCT arm were generally 
similar to those for subjects in the SOCT arm in the FAS, except that more subjects had CR in response 
to first-line therapy (23 subjects [37%] and 47 subjects [26%], respectively), an ECOG score of 0 (42 
subjects  [68%]  and  100  subjects  [56%],  respectively),  and  response  to  first  line  therapy  at 
randomization of relapse < 6 months and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy as derived from the clinical 
database (16 subjects [26%] 
and  24  subjects  [13%],  respectively)  and  conversely,  fewer  subjects  had  primary  refractory  disease 
(63% and 74%, respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 359 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or SOCT, 
with 180 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 179 subjects in the SOCT arm.

Notes: 437 subjects were screened. The full analysis set consists of all randomized subjects and subjects are analyzed based on 
randomized treatment arm. The safety analysis set is defined as the subset of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of axicabtagene ciloleucel as protocol therapy or standard of care salvage chemotherapy as protocol therapy, and subjects are 
analyzed by the protocol therapy they received. The safety analysis set – auto-SCT is defined as the subset of subjects who are 
randomized to the standard of care therapy arm and undergo auto-SCT as part of protocol therapy. The QoL analysis set is defined 
as the subset of subjects in the full analysis set who have a baseline and any post-baseline assessment up to Day 150 
post-randomization QoL assessment. The safety retreatment analysis set consists of subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm 
who undergo retreatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
The first subject was enrolled (ie, randomized) into ZUMA-7 on 25 January 2018 and enrollment was 
completed  on  04  October  2019;  ZUMA-7  is  currently  ongoing.  The  data  cutoff  date  for  the  primary 
analysis described in this clinical overview was 18 March 2021. 
All randomized subjects had the opportunity to be followed for at least 15 months after randomization. 
The  median  potential  follow-up  time  (from  randomization  to  the  data  cutoff  date)  was  24.94  months 
(range: 17.48 to 37.75 months). For the 180 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and the 179 
subjects in the SOCT arm, the median potential follow-up time was 25.00 months (range: 17.48 to 37.75 
months) and 24.84 months (range: 17.58 to 37.26 months), respectively; and the median actual follow-
up  time  was  20.07  months  (range:  0.59  to  37.75  months)  and  18.23  months  (range:  0.03  to  37.26 
months), respectively.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: EFS per Central Assessment 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  EFS  using  blinded  central  assessment.  To  test  the  superiority  of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel over SOCT, a log-rank test stratified by randomization factors (response to first-
line therapy and sAAIPI) was conducted.  
At  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff  (18  March  2021),  252  EFS  events  by  blinded  central  assessment  had 
occurred for 108 subjects (60%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 144 subjects (80%) in the SOCT 
arm. 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment was superior to SOCT, with a stratified HR of 0.398 (95% CI: 0.308, 
0.514;  stratified  log-rank  p  <  0.0001).  The  KM  median  EFS  time  for  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and 
SOCT arms was 8.3 months (95% CI: 4.5, 15.8 months; range: 0 to 31 months with censoring [+]) and 
2.0 months (95% CI: 1.6, 2.8 months; range: 0 [+] to 33 [+] months), respectively. 
The KM estimates of the percentage of subjects who remained event-free at 12 and 24 months after 
randomization  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  were  47.2%  (95%  CI:  39.8%,  54.3%)  and  40.5% 
(95%  CI:  33.2%,  47.7%),  respectively,  compared  with  17.6%  (95%  CI:  12.3%,  23.6%)  and  16.3% 
(95% CI: 11.1%, 22.2%), respectively, in the SOCT arm.

The median follow-up time for EFS using the reverse KM method was 23.0 months (95% CI: 20.9 to 
24.0 months) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 21.2 months (95% CI: 20.4 to 23.7 months) in the 
SOCT arm. 
The  primary  analysis  of  EFS  used  the  stratification  factors  as  collected  via  IxRS  at  randomization. 
Sensitivity  analyses  of  EFS  using  stratification  factors  derived  from  the  eCRF  and  EFS  without 
stratification also demonstrated axicabtagene ciloleucel superiority (HR: 0.406, 95% CI: 0.313, 0.525, 
log-rank p < 0.0001; HR: 0.423, 95% CI: 0.328, 0.544, log-rank p < 0.0001, respectively). 
The  most  common  EFS  events  in  either  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  or  SOCT  arm  were  disease 
progression  (82  subjects  [46%]  and  75  subjects  [42%],  respectively),  new  lymphoma  therapy  (9 
subjects [5%] and 63 subjects [35%], respectively), and death from any cause (11 subjects [6%] and 
6 subjects [3%], respectively). 
At the data cutoff date, 72 subjects (40%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 35 subjects (20%) in 
the SOCT arm were censored, with the most common reason being ongoing response (72 subjects [40%] 
and 28 subjects [16%], respectively). Of note, only 8 subjects (all in the SOCT arm) of the 359 subjects 
in the FAS were censored before Month 12.  
Twelve subjects (2 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 10 in the SOCT arm) initiated a new lymphoma 
therapy  in  the  absence  of  an  evaluable  postbaseline  disease  assessment  and  had  EFS  event  dates 
imputed as the randomization date as predefined in the statistical analysis plan. 
No subjects in the axicabtagene-ciloleucel arm underwent auto-SCT while in response.

Notes: EFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression per Lugano Classification 
{Cheson 2014}, commencement of new lymphoma therapy (including SCT in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm without 
axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced response or retreatment of axicabtagene ciloleucel), or death from any cause. The stratification 
factors are response to first-line therapy (primary refractory versus relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy versus relapse > 6 and 
≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (0 to 1 versus 2 to 3) as collected 
via interactive voice/web response system. The derived stratification factors are based on data collected on case report forms. 
Stratified (or unstratified) Cox regression models are used to provide the estimated hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% CIs for 
axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to standard of care therapy. The Breslow method is used to handle the ties for the Cox regression 
models. One-sided p-value from log-rank test is presented. Censored times are represented with “+”; censoring is indicated 
regardless of whether any uncensored events occurred at the same time. Event/censoring time was calculated as event/censoring 
date – randomization date + 1 (= days) / 30.4375 (= months).  
a.  Only 8 subjects (all in the standard of care therapy arm) of a total of 359 subjects were censored before Month 12 (m5.3.5.1, 
ZUMA-7 Primary Analysis CSR, Listing 16.2.1.1).  
b.  A total of 12 subjects (2 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 10 in the standard of care therapy arm) initiated a new 
lymphoma therapy in the absence of any post-baseline evaluable disease assessment (m5.3.5.1, ZUMA-7 Primary Analysis 
CSR, Listings 16.2.1.1 and 16.2.1.2) and had EFS event dates imputed as the randomization date as predefined in the

Subgroup Analyses of EFS 
The EFS rate for each treatment arm, using blinded central assessment of response, was further analyzed 
in  subgroups  defined  by  selected  baseline  demographic  and  disease  characteristics.  For  subgroups 
wherein few subjects were included, data should be interpreted with caution. 
Across the majority of subgroup categories, axicabtagene ciloleucel was favored over SOCT. 
For the randomization stratification factor of response to first-line therapy, trends were similar between 
IxRS data and data derived from the clinical database. Subjects with derived relapse ≤ 12 months of 
completion  of  first-line  therapy  (relapse  ≤  6  months  of  first-line  therapy  and  relapse  >  6  and  ≤  12 
months of first-line therapy subgroups were collapsed due to low subject numbers) had a median EFS 
time per central assessment in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms of not reached (NR) (95% 
CI:  14.3  months,  not  estimable;  n  =  46)  and  3.7  months  (95%  CI:  2.0,  6.5  months;  n  =  46), 
respectively; with a stratified HR of 0.306 (95% CI: 0.178, 0.528). In comparison, subjects who were 
refractory to first-line therapy had a median EFS time in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms of 
4.3 months (95% CI: 3.6, 8.0 months; n = 133) and 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.6, 2.3 months; n = 132), 
respectively; with a stratified HR of 0.443 (95% CI: 0.332, 0.591). 
For the randomization stratification factor of sAAIPI (data derived from the clinical database), median

SOCT arms was 14.3 months (95% CI: 5.1 months, not estimable; n = 94) and 2.6 months (95% CI: 
1.7,  3.4  months;  n  =  100),  respectively,  with  a  stratified  HR  of  0.439  (95%  CI:  0.306,  0.632).  In 
comparison, the median EFS time for subjects with a score of 2 to 3 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and 
SOCT arms was 4.9 months (95% CI: 3.7, 13.6 months; n = 86) and 1.7 months (95% CI: 1.6, 2.3 
months; n = 79), respectively, with a stratified HR of 0.349 (95% CI: 0.242, 0.503). 
For disease subtype as determined by the investigator, the median EFS time per central assessment for 
subjects with DLBCL, NOS, in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms was 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.9, 
14.9  months;  n  =  110)  and  1.8  months  (95%  CI:  1.6,  2.7  months;  n  =  116),  respectively,  with  a 
stratified  HR  of  0.372  (95%  CI:  0.269,  0.515).  Subjects  with  large  cell  transformation  of  FL  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 28.6 months (95% CI: 3.6 months, 
not estimable; n = 19) and 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.6, 7.3; n = 27), respectively, with a stratified HR of 
0.352  (95%  CI:  0.160,  0.773).  Subjects  with  HGBL  (with  or  without  MYC  and  BCL2  and/or  BCL6 
rearrangements) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 21.5 months 
(95%  CI:  3.7  months,  not  estimable;  n  =  43)  and  2.1  months  (95%  CI:  1.5,  6.6  months;  n  =  27), 
respectively, with a stratified HR of 0.468 (95% CI: 0.244, 0.898). 
For disease subtype as determined by the central laboratory, median EFS time per central assessment 
for subjects with DLBCL (including DLBCL, NOS, and DLBCL without further classification possible) in the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms was 5.4 months (95% CI: 3.8, 15.5 months; n = 126) and 2.3 
months (95% CI: 1.7, 3.2 months; n = 120), respectively, with a stratified HR of 0.443 (95% CI: 0.325, 
0.603).  Subjects  with  HGBL  with  or  without  MYC  and  BCL2  and/or  BCL6  rearrangements  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 21.5 months (95% CI: 3.7 months, 
not estimable; n = 31) and 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.5, 3.9 months; n = 26), respectively, with a stratified 
HR of 0.285 (95% CI: 0.137, 0.594). 
For the high-risk factor of rearrangement of or overexpression of MYC and BCL-2 and/or BCL6, double- 
or triple-hit or double-expressor status was determined by the central laboratory and median EFS was 
determined  by  central  assessment.  Subjects  with  HGBL  double-  or  triple-hit  lymphomas  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 21.5 months (95% CI: 3.7 months, 
not estimable; n = 31) and 1.6 months (95% CI: 1.5, 3.9 months; n = 25), respectively, with a stratified 
HR of 0.285 (95% CI: 0.137, 0.593). Subjects with double-expressor lymphomas in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 7.2 months (95% CI: 3.7 months, not estimable; n 
= 57) and 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.7, 3.5 months; n = 62), respectively, with a stratified HR of 0.424 
(95% CI: 0.268, 0.671). 
For the high-risk factor of older age, subjects ≥ 65 years of age in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT 
arms  had  a  median  EFS  time  per  central  assessment  of  21.5  months  (95%  CI:  5.0  months,  not 
estimable; n = 51) and 2.5 months (95% CI: 1.6, 3.2 months; n = 58), respectively, with a stratified 
HR of 0.276 (95% CI: 0.164, 0.465). In comparison, subjects < 65 years of age in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and SOCT arms had a median EFS time of 5.1 months (95% CI: 3.6, 14.7 months; n = 129) 
and 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.6, 2.9 months; n = 121), respectively, with a stratified HR of 0.490 (95%

1. ORR per Blinded Central Assessment 
ORR was higher in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm (83% of subjects) than in the SOCT arm (50% of 
subjects), with a statistically significant difference in ORR between the treatment arms of 33.1% (95% 
CI: 23.2%, 42.1%; stratified CMH p < 0.0001; odds ratio = 5.31 [95% CI: 3.08, 8.90; stratified CMH 
test  p < 0.0001).  The  CR  rate  was  also  numerically  higher  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  (65%) 
compared with the SOCT arm (32%).

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CMH, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; CR, complete response; NA, not applicable; ORR, 
objective response rate; PR, partial response.   
Notes: 95% CI for rate is from the Clopper-Pearson method, and the 95% CI for the difference in ORR (standard of care therapy 
arm as reference group) is from Wilson's score method with continuity correction. Response assessments per Lugano 
Classification {Cheson 2014}. The stratification factors are response to first-line therapy (primary refractory versus relapse 
≤ 6 months of first-line therapy versus relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted 
International Prognostic Index (0 to 1 versus 2 to 3) as collected via interactive voice/web response system. One-sided p-value 
from CMH test is presented. “Undefined/no disease” include subjects who were found to have no disease at baseline or follow-up 
by central assessment but had disease by investigator assessment. “Not evaluable” disease assessments were performed but no 
conclusion could be made. 
Concordance between the investigator and blinded central assessment of ORR was high at 89% (κ = 
0.76; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.83). Sensitivity analysis of ORR per investigator assessment was consistent with 
the ORR results based on blinded central assessment, with a difference in ORR between arms of 38.1% 
(95% CI: 28.1%, 47.0%). 
Subgroup analysis of ORR per Blinded Central Assessment 
In the majority of subgroups, differences in ORR were consistent with the FAS, favoring axicabtagene 
ciloleucel over SOCT. Data should be interpreted with caution for subgroups that included few subjects. 
Subgroup analysis of differences in CR rate were consistent with ORR subgroup analysis.

2. OS 
After significant improvement in EFS and ORR was demonstrated in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm over 
the SOCT arm, the interim analysis of OS was to assess the difference between treatment arms using 
log-rank tests stratified by randomization factors. 
After the EFS primary analysis data cutoff date, Kite obtained additional survival follow-up for subjects 
discontinued from ZUMA-7 and that was not available at the time of the interim OS analysis (which was 
conducted at the time of the EFS primary analysis) but occurred before the data cutoff date of 18 March 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 63/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2021.  At  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff,  72 subjects  (40%)  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  and 
85 subjects (47%) in the SOCT arm had died (stratified HR of 0.708 [95% CI: 0.515, 0.972]). In the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm the KM estimated median OS had not been reached with a median follow-up 
time  for  OS  (reverse  KM  approach)  of  24.7  months  (95%  CI:  23.3,  26.0).  In  the  SOCT  arm  the  KM 
estimated median OS was 25.7 months with a median follow-up time for OS of 24.4 month (95% CI: 
22.5, 25.7). 
While the data are still immature, the interim analysis of OS favored axicabtagene ciloleucel over SOCT, 
but the  difference  between  the  treatment  arms  was  not  statistically  significant  (p = 0.0159  with  a  1-
sided alpha of 0.004 allocated to the interim OS analysis).

Although  there  was  no  planned  crossover  between  treatment  arms,  subjects  who  did  not  respond  to 
SOCT could receive subsequent treatment for lymphoma deemed appropriate by the investigator, such 
as non-study specific chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted agents, as well as anti-CD19 CAR T-cell 
therapy  off  protocol.  Of  the  179 subjects  randomized  to  the  SOCT  arm,  100 subjects  (56%)  later 
EMA/804955/2022

received commercially available or investigational cell therapy as new lymphoma therapy after SOCT (ie, 
treatment switching rate). Sensitivity analyses of OS were performed to address the confounding effects 
from subsequent cell therapy in the SOCT arm. The sensitivity analysis results reinforced the positive 
trend seen for OS in the FAS.

Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
1. PFS per Investigator Assessment 
The KM median PFS time based on the investigator assessment was longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm compared with the SOCT arm (14.7 months [95% CI: 5.4, not estimable] versus 3.7 months [95% 
CI: 2.9, 5.3]) (stratified HR of 0.490 [95% CI: 0.368, 0.652]). The median follow-up time for PFS using 
the reverse KM method was 22.6 months (95% CI: 20.8, 24.0) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 
19.6 months (95% CI: 14.6, 21.2) in the SOCT arm.

The stratification factors are response to first-line therapy (primary refractory versus relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy 
versus relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (0 to 1 
versus 2 to 3) as collected via IxRS. Stratified (or unstratified) Cox regression models are used to provide the estimated hazard 
ratio and 2-sided 95% CIs for axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to standard of care. One-sided p-value from log-rank test is 
presented. Censored times are represented with “+”; censoring is indicated regardless of whether any uncensored events occurred

mEFS  was  defined  the  same  way  as  EFS,  except  that  SD  as  the  best  response  by  Study  Day 150 
assessment was not considered an event.  
Based on the blinded central assessment of mEFS,  104 subjects (58%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm and 144 subjects (80%) in the SOCT arm had had an event at the time of the data cutoff (stratified 
HR of 0.376 [95% CI: 0.290, 0.487]). The KM median mEFS was longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm (10.3 months [95% CI: 5.0, 21.5]) than in the SOCT arm (2.0 months [95% CI: 1.6, 2.8]).

axicabtagene ciloleucel-induced response or retreatment of axicabtagene ciloleucel), or death from any cause. Having SD as the 
best response by Day 150 assessment post-randomization will not be considered as an event. The stratification factors are 
response to first-line therapy (primary refractory versus relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy versus relapse > 6 and 
≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and second-line age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (0 to 1 versus 2 to 3) as collected

hazard ratio and 2-sided 95% CIs for axicabtagene ciloleucel relative to standard of care therapy. The Breslow method is used to 
handle the ties for the Cox regression models. One-sided p-value from log-rank test is presented. Censored times are represented

Notes: Therapies taken during retreatment period in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm are included. 
In Table above, percentages represent subject incidences for each therapy, regardless of lines of therapy 
that  each  subject  received,  and  if  multiple  therapies  are  included  in  the  line  of  therapy,  each  line  of 
therapy  can  be  counted  in  > 1 category  (eg,  if  salvage  chemotherapy  followed  by  high-dose  therapy 
[HDT]+auto-SCT  is  considered  a  line  of  therapy  per  investigator,  it  is  counted  under  both 
chemo[immune]therapy and HDT+auto-SCT). 
Overall, 38% of patients received chemo(immuno)therapy as any line of subsequent therapy, while 29% 
received this therapy as the first subsequent therapy after axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Data collection for subjects who received subsequent therapies was limited and did not include collection 
of  scheduled  disease  assessments.  Subsequent  therapies  were  not  protocol-defined  and,  after  new 
lymphoma therapy, disease assessments were not required at regular intervals (as was for on-protocol 
therapy) and were per standard of care and investigator discretion. 
Therefore, efficacy analyses for the 29% of subjects (n = 53) who received chemo(immuno)therapy as 
the first subsequent therapy after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion are limited to ORR, CR, time-to-
next therapy, and the percentage who proceeded to HDT-ASCT (13%; n = 7) and are summarized in 
Table below. EFS and progression-free survival (PFS) are not provided because there were no scheduled 
disease assessments after a subject received a new lymphoma therapy, which was received off-protocol, 
and the date of the last evaluable disease assessment could not be obtained for EFS and PFS censoring.

1. EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status 
Baseline (screening visit) mean EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status scores for evaluable subjects in the 
QoL analysis set were comparable between the axicabtagene ciloleucel (68.6 [95% CI: 65.6, 71.7]) and 
SOCT (70.1 [95% CI: 66.1, 74.1]) arms. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  difference  in the  mean  change of  scores 
from baseline to Study Day 100 (estimated difference 18.1 [95% CI: 12.3, 23.9]; adjusted p < 0.0001) 
in  favor  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel.  This  difference  was  also  statistically  significant  at  Study  Day 150 
(estimated  difference  9.8  [95%  CI:  2.6,  17.0];  adjusted  p = 0.0124).  Mean  estimated  scores  had

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
ZUMA-7 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel  versus  SOCT  in  adult  subjects  with  r/r  LBCL.  Adult  subjects  with  r/r  LBCL  after  first-line 
rituximab and anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene 
ciloleucel or SOCT. Randomization was stratified by response to first-line therapy (primary refractory, 
relapse ≤ 6 months of first-line therapy, or relapse > 6 and ≤ 12 months of first-line therapy) and sAAIPI 
(0 to 1, or 2 to 3), as assessed at the time of screening.  
The stratification factor for response to first line therapy was modified in the conduct of study with 
Amendment 4 and was changed from time since initiation of first line therapy to time since initiation or 
completion of first line therapy. The inclusion factor for response to first line therapy was modified in 
the same way. This led to an inclusion criterion and a stratification factor, which were not well-defined 
after Amendment 4. This change was justified by differing definitions of early relapsed disease in the 
literature and the fact that also subjects with refractory or progressive disease within 12 months after 
completion of therapy have a poor prognosis. Neither of these two reasons provide a strong or 
compelling reason to implement such a change in an ongoing, open-label trial, which is hence not 
endorsed. Upon request the applicant clarified that this broadened definition of early relapsed disease 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 83/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lead to the inclusion of only 16 additional subjects (4.5% of the total sample size). On the one hand 
this makes the necessity of broadening the inclusion criterion somewhat questionable, on the other 
hand it shows that the impact is likely to be minor. This was further substantiated by sensitivity 
analyses, which were provided upon request. They show that the treatment effect was only marginally 
impacted. At the same time they all indicate that the treatment benefit for OS and EFS in subjects who 
relapsed or were refractory after 12 months from initiation of 1L therapy was smaller compared to 
subjects who relapsed or were refractory before 12 months from initiation of 1L therapy. To 
substantiate that a treatment benefit for subjects with later relapse/refractory disease is still present 
additional subgroup analyses were requested. 
For subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, treatment consisted of lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
followed by a single intravenous infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel. Bridging therapy of corticosteroids 
was  allowed  prior  to  lymphodepleting  chemotherapy  for  subjects  with  high  disease  burden,  at  the 
discretion of the investigator. For subjects in the SOCT arm, treatment consisted of a platinum-based 
salvage  chemotherapy  regimen  as  selected  by  the  treating  investigator  from several  protocol  defined 
options. Subjects who responded to salvage chemotherapy were to proceed to HDT with or without TBI, 
followed by auto-SCT. The treatment scheme in the SOCT arm is in line with the current ESMO GL, which 
recommends  salvage  regimens  with  rituximab  and  chemotherapy  followed  by  HDT  and  ASCT.  The 
salvage chemotherapy regimens used represent current medical practice. 
The primary objective was to determine if axicabtagene ciloleucel is superior to SOCT as measured by 
EFS, as determined by blinded central assessment. 
Key secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with SOCT on 
ORR  (determined  by  blinded  central  assessment),  OS,  PFS  (determined  by  investigator  assessment), 
and DOR and duration of CR among responding subjects (determined by blinded central assessment), 
and to evaluate the safety and effect of PROs and QoL of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with SOCT. 
The analysis of EFS, ORR and OS was controlled for multiplicity using a hierarchical approach.  
The analysis of OS followed a group sequential design (i.e., with interim analyses), which was modified 
multiple times throughout the study. The first interim analysis was planned at the time the EFS analysis, 
which  was  initially  assumed  to  happen  after  140  OS  events.  With  Amendment  5  (25  June  2020)  this 
interim analysis was assumed to happen after 110 OS events and a second interim analysis after 160 
OS events was introduced. In parallel the alpha-spending function was changed from an O’Brien-Fleming 
spending function to a Kim-deMets spending function. The changes were justified by the lower number 
of expected OS events by the time of the EFS analysis and by the wish to reserve sufficient alpha for the 
final analysis in order to maintain the overall power for OS, which is considered comprehensible. Nominal 
significance levels were defined in the protocol as well, but did not match the alpha spending function 
(see Statistical Methods for details). At the time of the first interim analysis (18 March 2021) the second 
interim  analysis  was  dropped  again  as  153  events  had  accrued  by  that  time.  Upon  request  the  MAH 
clarified that the Kim-deMets alpha spending function (with ρ = 6) and one interim analysis after 153 
OS evens (IF = 73%) and a final analysis planned at 210 events is to be used. This leaves α = 2.44% 
for the final analysis. In principle this is considered acceptable. However, given the uncertainties in the 
definition of the alpha spending function and significance levels to be applied and the post hoc nature of 
this decision, this is considered to add uncertainties with respect to the robustness of the OS analyses. 
A type 1 error inflation cannot be fully excluded. 
The study was open-label, which is endorsed given the different treatment (and manufacturing) 
profiles, where blinding would have been infeasible. A DSMB was installed for safety (and efficacy) 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 84/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
reviews and a trial integrity document (TID) was in place to detail the access to (restricted) data, 
which is in principle endorsed as well.  
It can be seen from the TID, however, that not only monitors had access to subject level or 
aggregated data but that operations managers, statistical programmers and biostatisticians had 
access, the latter to full access at any time. Seemingly the access to treatment allocation was 
restricted for all sponsor’s personnel, and statisticians involved in the protocol changes were not 
identical to the study team biostatisticians/programmers and had no access to the ZUMA-7 study data. 
However, no clearly defined firewall was in place to separate individuals involved in the monitoring of 
the study from individuals involved in the conduct of the study. This is considered problematic as it 
cannot be excluded that changes have been made in the light of the accruing data (i.e., post hoc with 
an unknown and unquantifiable impact on the results especially for OS). Upon request, the MAH 
clarified that no analyses by treatment arm were conducted prior to the primary EFS analysis and that 
the decisions were not made in the light of accruing data. 
A total of 359 subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive axicabtagene ciloleucel or SOCT, 
with 180 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 179 subjects in the SOCT arm.  
In the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm 178 patients underwent leukapheresis, 65 patients received bridging 
therapy, 172 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and 170 patients received axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. 
While more male and younger subjects were enrolled, the distribution across the two treatment arms 
are similar. The distribution of patients across baseline and disease characteristics was similar in both 
arms.  While  the  distribution  between  the  two  treatment  arms  is  similar  here  as  well,  the  molecular 
subgrouping seems to be slightly different compared to the general DLBCL population: 61% GCB and 
9% ABC (55%-5% in the SOCT arm), whereas in the literature there is a prevalence of 50% vs ~35-
40% for these subtypes. This means a relative underrepresentation of the ABC subtype, although this is 
similarly present in both treatment arms.   
For  the  180  subjects  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  and  the  179  subjects  in  the  SOCT  arm,  the 
median potential follow-up time was 25.00 months (range: 17.48 to 37.75 months) and 24.84 months 
(range: 17.58 to 37.26 months), respectively; and the median actual follow-up time was 20.07 months 
(range: 0.59 to 37.75 months) and 18.23 months (range: 0.03 to 37.26 months), respectively. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  met:  at  the  primary  EFS  analysis,  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of an EFS event compared with SOCT 
(stratified HR = 0.398 [95% CI: 0.308, 0.514]; stratified log-rank p < 0.0001). 
These  EFS  data  provide  compelling  arguments  in  favour  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  the  patient 
population studied. Importantly, there seem to be no difference in efficacy for sex, and also both age 
groups below and above 65 years benefitted from the therapy.  
Of note, EFS events were imputed as the randomization date (in case of the initiation of a new lymphoma 
therapy in the absence of any evaluable disease assessment). Given the nature of the events that led to 
an imputation for an EFS event at Day 0 (in cases where a patients’ preference for another treatment 
than the assigned standard of care) and the imbalances in these events between treatment groups (N 
= 10 in SOCT and N = 2 in axicabtagene ciloleucel) this is considered problematic. It seems to be partly 
EMA/804955/2022  
Page 85/129 
 
 
 
  
 
 
based  on  patients’  preferences  in  this  open  label  study  and  results  in  bias  in  favor  of  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel. This apparently makes the derived treatment estimates for EFS anti-conservative. Despite the 
definition in the SAP this is hence not endorsed. It is acknowledged, however, that these intercurrent 
events do not impact the derivation and interpretation of OS, and should not impact EFS to an extend 
which would render the benefit questionable. 
Importantly,  there  is  no  difference  in  the  EFS  results  for  the  different  molecular  subtypes,  and 
axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment provided a benefit for both GCB-like and ABC-like disease: generally, 
ABC  DLBCL 
is  associated  with  substantially  worse  outcomes  when  treated  with  standard 
chemoimmunotherapy. Additionally, axicabtagene ciloleucel proved to be superior to SOCT for all disease 
subtypes. 
While for EFS (per central assessment), axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment was superior to SOCT when 
assessed  by  CD19  IHC-positive  status,  for  CD19  IHC-negative  subjects  (number  of  subjects:  n=13 
axicabtagene ciloleucel, n=12 SOCT), the KM median EFS was longer in the SOCT arm compared with 
the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm.  Nonetheless,  for  the  ORR  (per  central  assessment),  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel treatment was superior to SOCT when assessed by CD19 IHC-positive or IHC-negative status. 
The ORR for CD19 IHC-positive subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms was 83% and 
52%, respectively, and for CD19 IHC-negative subjects was 85% and 67%, respectively. However, the 
complete  response  data  does  not  show  a  superiority  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  treatment:  38% 
axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. 42% SOCT. It seems that the CD19 negative patients were more likely to 
have partial response as an outcome when compared to SOCT: 46% vs. 25%.  
While similar ORR findings, when comparing the outcomes of CD19 positive vs. negative patients, CD19 
positive  patients  benefitted  more  from  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  treatment,  than  the  CD19  negative 
subjects: complete response: 67% for CD19 positives vs. 38% for CD19 negatives; partial response: 
16% CD19 positives, 46% CD19 negatives. 
While there are a number of CD19 negative patients who benefitted from axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, 
a clear-cut and definite superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. SOCT cannot be established, moreover, 
outcome data are more favourable in CD19 positive patients when compared to CD19 negative subjects. 
The data are less reliable due to the lower patient numbers, yet these tendencies are clearly observable. 
More data are required to draw definite conclusions on the efficacy in CD19 negative patients. 
Since there is no definite data to prove a benefit of axicabtagene ciloleucel over SOCT in CD19- negative 
patients, this aspect needs to be included in the SmPC.  
A total of 65 patients (36%) received bridging therapy. In the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, the ORR was 
the same for the 65 subjects who received bridging therapy (83%) and the 115 subjects who did not 
receive bridging therapy (83%) The CR rate was also similar: 66% for subjects who received bridging 
therapy and 64% for subjects who did not receive bridging therapy. It can be concluded, that bridging 
therapy did not influence the outcomes measured.   
Axicabtagene ciloleucel also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR with ORR rates 
of 83% in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 50% in the SOCT arm. Given that objective response is 
a prerequisite to reach HDT-auto-SCT, the ORR translates into at least 50% of subjects in the SOCT arm 
not being able to reach definitive therapy. The CR rate was 2-fold higher in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm (65%) compared with the SOCT arm (32%).

The  ZUMA-7  interim  OS  results  (cutoff  date  18  Mar  2021)  suggested  a  trend  favouring  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel (median OS had not been reached) over SOCT (median OS of 25.7 months). While the data 
are still immature, the interim analysis of OS favoured axicabtagene ciloleucel over SOCT.  
The KM median PFS time was longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm.  Although not included in this 
AR, the PFS subgroup analysis revealed that patients with diagnosis labelled as “other”, as well as Asians 
and African Americans had no benefit beyond standard of care. The importance of this result is blurred 
by the relatively low number of patients in these subgroups. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
ZUMA-7  demonstrated  superior  efficacy  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  as  a  second-line  therapy  in  adult 
subjects with r/r LBCL compared to SOCT. The chosen SOCT arm is in line with the current ESMO GL 
and, as such, acceptable. Of note, the recruited patient population may not be fully representative of 
the population encountered in clinical practice (e.g. proportion of ABC-like disease type). Issues in the 
conduct of study result in uncertainties regarding the derived effects: Measures such as a firewall to fully 
blind the study team in charge with the conduct of study where not in place and hence decisions to alter 
the study might have been made in the light of the accrued data. Modifications to the analysis plan for 
OS render the type 1 error control for OS questionable. As the study was not powered for OS, only a 
numerical (rather than statistically significant) benefit might be derived for OS anyhow. Given the results 
for EFS, ORR and CR, this is considered acceptable.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  safety  data  analysis  set  (SAS)  is  based  on  the  main  study  KTE-C19-107  (ZUMA  7),  which  is  an 
ongoing (FU ongoing, not recruiting) Phase 3 randomized open label clinical trial in adult subjects with 
relapsed/refractory  DLBCL,  evaluating  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  compared  with  SOCT  (salvage 
chemotherapy followed by HDT-auto-SCT) as second line treatment. The primary analysis was performed 
when 250 event-free survival (EFS) events had been observed by central assessment and all subjects 
had passed the Month 9 time point. Data are provided as of DCO 18 Mar 2021 for 170 subjects who 
received axicabtagene ciloleucel and 168 subjects who received at least 1 dose of salvage chemotherapy 
in the SOCT arm (safety analysis set). 
At the date of data cutoff (18 March 2021), the ZUMA-7 study had ended for 66 subjects (37%) who 
had received axicabtagene ciloleucel and for 86 subjects (48%) who had received ≥ 1 dose of standard 
of  care  salvage  chemotherapy.  The  primary  reason  for  ending  the  study  for  subjects  who  received 
axicabtagene ciloleucel was death for 64 subjects (36%) and lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%). The 
primary reason for ending the study for subjects who received SOCT was death for 75 subjects (42%), 
withdrawal of consent for 7 subjects (4%), lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%), investigator decision 
for 1 subject (1%), and other reason for 1 subject (1%). At DCO, the median actual follow-up times of 
subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms were 19.6 months and 18.0 months, respectively; 
the median potential follow-up times were 24.1 months and 24.9 months, respectively, and the minimum 
potential follow-up times were 16.0 months and 17.2 months, respectively.

As supportive safety data for this indication extension application, the MAH submitted results from the 
ongoing (FU ongoing, not recruiting) KTE-C19-101 (ZUMA-1) study, Phase 1 and Phase 2 Cohorts 1 and 
2. The ZUMA-1 study title is “A Phase1/2 Multicenter Study Evaluation the Safety and Efficacy of KTE-
C19 in Subjects with Refractory Aggressive non-Hodgkin-Lymphoma”. Data are included and presented 
side by side and pooled with the 18 Mar 2021 as date of DCO for the analyses. The median actual follow-
up time were 23.5 months, and the minimum of potential follow-up time was 54.1 months. At DCO the 
study had ended for 63 subjects (53%) who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel. For all 63 subjects 
whose participation in the study has ended, the primary reason was death.

Exposure to lymphodepletion (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine)  
Of 170 subjects, 169 had an available BSA (body surface area). Median BSA cyclophosphamide adjusted 
dose was 1,500 mg/m2 (range: 1,211 to 1,618 mg/m2), and median BSA fludarabine adjusted dose was 
90mg/m2 (range 60 to 95 mg/m2. A total of 165/169 (98%) and 164/165 (97%) subjects received the 
planned  total  BSA-adjusted  dose  (±  10%)  of  cyclophosphamide  (1,500  mg/m2)  and  fludarabine  (90 
mg/m2), respectively.

Axicabtagene  ciloleucel  was  infused  in  an  inpatient  setting,  where  subjects  were  monitored  at  a 
healthcare facility for a minimum of 7 days. Five subjects/170 (3%) were planned as outpatient infusion 
with  subsequent  elective  submission  to  a  hospital  for  observation.    All  170  treated  subjects  were 
eventually hospitalized with a median duration of hospitalization of 16 days (range: 5 to 103 days). For 
all 170 subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm of the safety analysis set, the median total number 
of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion was 170 × 106 cells (range: 58 to 200 × 
106 cells) and the median total number of T cells infused was 301.5 × 106 (range: 88 to 633 × 106 cells). 
166/170 subjects (98%) received within 10% of the planned dose of 2 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg 
(or a flat dose of 200 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells for subjects weighing > 100 kg). For the 137 subjects 
who received axicabtagene ciloleucel and weighed ≤ 100 kg (81%), the median weight-adjusted dose

was 2 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells/kg (range: 1.0 to 2.1 × 106 cells/kg) and all 33 subjects who weighed 
> 100 kg (19%) received the planned flat total dose of 200 × 106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells.

Exposure to SOCT 
For the 168 subjects in the SOCT arm of the safety analysis set, 152 subjects (90%) received 2 or 3 
cycles as directed by the protocol, as outlined below, and 16 subjects (10%) received 1 cycle of salvage 
chemotherapy. Among the subjects who received 2 or 3 cycles of salvage chemotherapy and responded, 
defined by CR or PR per investigator assessment at Study Day 50, 64 subjects received HDT and reached 
HDT-auto-SCT, of whom 62 subjects (37% of the SOCT − safety analysis set) went on to receive auto-
SCT  on  protocol  and  2  subjects  received  auto-SCT  off  protocol.  In  the  SOCT  arm,  there  were  59 
incidences of hospitalization for administration of SCT and the median duration of hospitalization was 21 
days (range: 1 to 3 days).

Adverse events 
Methodology of assessed parameters 
ZUMA-7 
Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were to be collected from the time of randomization 
through  to  either  Day  150  after  randomization or  the  initiation of  new  lymphoma  therapy,  whichever 
came first. After Day 150, only targeted SAEs were to be reported. Targeted SAEs are those SAEs that 
are neurologic, hematologic, infections, autoimmune disorders, and secondary malignancies, and these 
are  to  be  reported  for  up  to  15  years  or  5  years  for  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  SOCT  arms, 
respectively,  or  until  disease  progression,  whichever  occurs  first.  All  subjects  are  also  followed  for 
survival data for 5 years. All AEs reported were treatment-emergent, defined as having onset date on 
or  after  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion  or  on  or  after  the  first  dose  of  standard  of  care-salvage 
chemotherapy, and were coded according to MedRA V23.1. Because AEs in the original submission for 
EMA/804955/2022 
Page 94/129 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
ZUMA-1  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  Cohorts  1  and  2  were  coded  using  MedDRA  version  19.0,  recoding  to 
MedDRA version 23.1 was performed for terms that had changed between versions 19.0 and 23.1. TEAE 
subgroups were:  
-  Age: ≥ 18 years and < 65, or ≥ 65 years 
-  Sex: male or female 
- 
- 
- 
ECOG performance status at baseline: 0 or 1 
Transduction  rate  of  the  CAR  T-cell  product:  by  quartiles  (axicabtagene  ciloleucel-treated 
subjects only) 
Total  number  of  CAR  T  cells  in  the  CAR  T-cell  product:  by  quartiles  (axicabtagene  ciloleucel-
treated subjects only). 
TEAEs  of  special  interest  with  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  include  identified  risks  (CRS,  neurologic 
events, cytopenias, infections, hypogammaglobulinemia), potential risks (TLS, secondary malignancies, 
aggravation  of  GvHD,  immunogenicity,  RCR)  and  additional  risks  (cardiac  arrhythmias/failure, 
autoimmune disorders, bone marrow failure). Prolonged cytopenias were identified as cytopenias present 
on Day 0 (day of axicabtagene infusion or SOCT first application) or Day 30 after treatment. Aggravation 
of GvHD was to comprise events that were of new onset or had worsened by 1 or more CTCAE grades 
after baseline.  
Deaths were analyzed according to time to death relative to either the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion 
or the commencement of standard of care salvage chemotherapy (within 30 days, between 31 and 92 
days, or after 92 days). 
Physical  examinations,  vital  signs,  and  electrocardiograms  (ECGs)  were  to  be  assessed  at 
screening and thereafter at regular intervals for up to 24 months and up to 150 days after randomization, 
respectively.  ECGs were to be recorded at baseline and then as clinically indicated. 
Neurological assessments were to be performed at baseline, and on Day 50 after randomization. In 
addition,  subjects  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  had  neurologic  assessments  on  the  day  of  the 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion  and  every  other  day  during  the  7-day  period  of  hospitalization 
immediately following the infusion. 
Hematology and blood chemistry: Samples were to be taken at screening, at regular intervals while 
the  subject’s  study  treatments  were  ongoing,  and  at  regular  intervals  thereafter  up  to  Day  150  after 
randomization. Regular blood samples for hematology will continue to be drawn up to Month 24 after 
randomization. 
Immunogenicity (axicabtagene ciloleucel arm only). Serum samples obtained from subjects prior 
to  leukapheresis  and  at  Day  50  after  randomization  were  to  be  tested  for  the  development  of  serum 
antibodies reactive to the anti-CD19 CAR. If either the pretreatment or Day 50 samples tested positive, 
further samples were to be taken every 3 months until the subject was either antibody negative or 12 
months had passed since the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. 
Replication-competent  retrovirus  (RCR;  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  only).  Blood  samples 
obtained from subjects prior to treatment and at Day 150 and Month 12 after randomization were to be 
tested for the presence of RCR. Additional blood samples are to be collected yearly for up to 15 years 
and will be tested if a subject tests positive at Day 150 or Month 12 after randomization. 
ZUMA-1(supportive data) 
In general the safety assessments performed were the same, although the timing of some assessments 
differed. Thus, the difference in safety follow-up between ZUMA-1 and ZUMA-7 is the duration of the 
collection  period  for  AEs  and  SAEs.  In  ZUMA-1,  AEs  were  to  be  collected  from  commencement  of 
EMA/804955/2022 
Page 95/129 
 
 
 
 
  
leukapheresis, and SAEs were to be collected from the time of informed consent. AE and SAE collection 
were to continue until Month 3 after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion. From Month 3 to either Month 
24 or PD (whichever occurred first), only serious targeted AEs were to be reported. To investigate the 
potential  impact  of  the  differences  in  the  duration  of  safety  follow-up  for  subjects  who  received 
axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  ZUMA-7  and  ZUMA-1,  ad-hoc  analyses  of  the  overall  subject  incidences  of 
TEAEs and targeted SAEs according to the TEAE or SAE start date were conducted as follows: 
- TEAE start date: ≤ 3 months (≤ 92 days) or > 3 months (> 92 days) after the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
infusion or the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. 
-  SAE  start  date:  ≤  24  months  (≤  731  days)  and >  24  months  (>  731  days)  after  the  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel infusion or the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. 
ZUMA-7 Results  
TEAEs  
Of 170 subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel in ZUMA-7, all subjects (100%) had ≥ 1 TEAE; 
155 subjects (91%) had a worst Grade 3 or higher TEAE. A total of 163 subjects (96%) had ≥ 1 TEAE 
related to axicabtagene ciloleucel, 112 subjects (66%) had ≥ 1 TEAE related to axicabtagene ciloleucel 
that was worst Grade 3 or higher, and 63 subjects (37%) had ≥ 1 SAE related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
A total of 14 subjects (8%) experienced Grade 5 TEAEs of whom 7 subjects (4%) had Grade 5 TEAEs 
that were not PD and 1 subject (1%) had a Grade 5 TEAE (hepatitis B reactivation) considered related 
to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
Of 168 subjects treated with SOCT, all subjects (100%) had ≥ 1 TEAE; 140 subjects (83%) had a worst 
Grade  3  or higher  TEAE.  A  total of  160  subjects  (95%)  had  ≥  1  TEAE  related  to  SOCT,  131  subjects 
(78%) had ≥ 1 treatment-related TEAE that was worst Grade 3 or higher. A total of 7 subjects (4%) 
experienced  Grade  5  TEAEs  of  whom  2  subjects  (1%)  had  Grade  5  TEAEs  that  were  not  PD;  both  of 
these  Grade  5  treatment-related  TEAEs  (acute  respiratory  distress  and  cardiac  arrest)  were  deemed 
related to SOCT (specifically HDT).

TEAEs by System Organ Class: 
The  3  most  common  system  organ  classes  in  which  TEAEs  were  reported  by  treatment  arm  were  as

Serious treatment-emergent neurologic events of any grade were reported for 34 subjects (20%) in the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 1 subject (1%) in the SOCT arm, including 26 subjects (15%) in the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm with a serious worst Grade 3 or higher neurologic event and 1 subject (1%) 
in the SOCT arm with a serious worst Grade 2 neurologic event. The 3 most common serious treatment-
emergent neurologic events of any grade in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm were encephalopathy (17 
subjects, 10%), aphasia (9 subjects, 5%), and confusional state (6 subjects, 4%), and the only serious 
neurologic event in the SOCT arm was encephalopathy. 
Treatment-related neurologic events were reported for 92 subjects (54%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm  and  24  subjects  (14%)  in  the  SOCT  arm,  including  35  subjects  (21%)  and  1  subject  (1%), 
respectively,  with  Grade  3  or  higher  neurologic  events.  The  most  frequently  reported  (in  ≥  10%  of 
subjects)  treatment-related  neurologic  events  of  any  grade  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  were 
tremor  (37  subjects,  22%),  confusional  state  (35  subjects,  21%),  aphasia  (35  subjects,  21%), 
encephalopathy (29 subject, 17%), and somnolence (18 subjects, 11%).  
No treatment-related neurologic events occurred with a subject incidence higher than 10% in the SOCT 
arm:  the  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  neurologic  events  in  the  SOCT  arm  were 
paresthesia (9 subjects, 5%), agitation, lethargy, cognitive disorder, depressed level of consciousness, 
delirium, and taste disorder (2 subjects each, 1%). 
Serious treatment-related neurologic events were reported for 32 subjects (19%) in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel arm, including 25 subjects (15%) with Grade 3 or higher serious neurologic events. No subject 
in the SOCT arm had a serious treatment related neurologic event. The most frequently reported (in ≥ 
2% of subjects) serious treatment-related neurologic events of any grade in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm  were  encephalopathy  (17  subjects,  10%),  aphasia  (9  subjects,  5%),  and  confusional  state, 
somnolence, and tremor (5 subjects each, 3%). 
Among  subjects  who  had  a  treatment-emergent  neurologic  event,  the  median  time  to  onset  was  7.0 
days (range: 1 to 133 days) after the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion and 23.0 days (range: 1 to 108 
days) after the first dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. 
At the data cutoff date, neurologic events had resolved in 96 of the 102 subjects in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel arm and in 32 of the 33 subjects in the SOCT arm. A total of 6 subjects in the axicabtagene 
ciloleucel arm and 1 subject in the SOCT arm had ongoing neurologic events at the data cutoff date or 
unresolved neurologic events at the time of death (source Listing 16.3.4.1.2 and Listing 16.3.7). Among 
subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm, 1 subject had ongoing neurologic events as of the data cutoff 
date and 5 subjects had neurologic events that were unresolved at the time of death, as follows: 
-  One subject had Grade 2 non-serious paresthesia of the lower limbs that started on Therapy day 
16 and Grade 1 non-serious memory impairment that started on Therapy day 17; both events 
were  ongoing  at  the  data  cutoff  date.  The  event  of  paresthesia  was  deemed  unrelated  to 
leukapheresis or study treatments and memory impairment was deemed related to axicabtagene 
ciloleucel.

-  One  subject  had  Grade  1  non-serious  tremor,  which  started  on  Therapy  day  5  and  was 
unresolved at the time of death due to PD on Therapy day 200. The event was deemed related 
to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
-  One subject had Grade 1 non-serious taste disorder, which started on Therapy day 37 and was 
unresolved at the time of death due to PD on Therapy day 240. The event was deemed related 
to lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
-  One subject had Grade 2 non-serious confusion and Grade 2 non-serious hallucination that both 
started on Therapy day 37, Grade 1 non-serious paresthesia that started on Therapy day 38, 
Grade  2  non-serious  agitation  that  started  on  Therapy  day  43,  and  Grade  4  non-serious 
depressed  level  of  consciousness  and  Grade  3  non-serious  somnolence  that  both  started  on 
Therapy day 45. These events were unresolved at the time of death due to PD on Therapy day 
46. The events were deemed unrelated to leukapheresis or study treatments.  
-  One subject had Grade 1 non-serious hypoesthesia, which started on Therapy day 77 and was-
unresolved at the time of death due to PD on Therapy day 326. The event was deemed-unrelated 
to leukapheresis or study treatments. 
-  One  subject  had  Grade  2  non-serious  tremor,  which  started  on  Therapy  day  4,  changed  to  a 
Grade  3  serious  event  on  Therapy  day  13,  and  changed  to  a  Grade  2  non-serious  event  on 
Therapy day 24 (Listing 16.3.2.1) and was unresolved at the time of death due to PD on Therapy 
day 206. The event was deemed related to axicabtagene ciloleucel. 
One subject in the SOCT arm had an ongoing neurologic event of Grade 1 non-serious paresthesia, which 
started on Therapy day 20 and was ongoing at the data cutoff date. The event was deemed related to 
SOCT (source Listing 16.3.4.1.2). 
Important Identified Risks (axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and SOCT arm) 
CRS 
CRS, an identified risk for axicabtagene ciloleucel, but not for agents used as SOCT, was reported for 
n=157/170 subjects (92%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm; 8 subjects (5%) had worst Grade 3 CRS, 
3 subjects (2%) had worst Grade 4 CRS, and no subjects had Grade 5 CRS. The most frequently reported 
CRS symptoms (in ≥ 30% of subjects with CRS) were pyrexia (155 subjects, 99%), hypotension (68 
subjects, 43%), and sinus tachycardia (49 subjects, 31%). The median time of onset was 3 days (range: 
1 to 10 days), and at DCO CRS was resolved in all subjects, with a median duration of 7 days (range: 2 
to 43 days). 
Cytopenias 
49 subjects (29%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 101 subjects (60%) in the SOCT arm had a 
prolonged worst Grade 3 or higher cytopenia event. The number of subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm who had worst Grade 3 or higher prolonged thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or anemia TEAEs were 
11 (6%), 44 (26%), and 5 (3%), respectively. The number of subjects treated with SOCT who had worst 
Grade  3  or  higher  prolonged  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anemia  TEAEs  were  78  (46%),  60 
(36%), and 57 (34%), respectively.

Infections 
In the safety analysis set, 70 subjects (41%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 51 subjects (30%) 
in  the  SOCT  arm  had  at  least  1  treatment-emergent  infection,  including  24  subjects  (14%)  and  19 
subjects  (11%),  respectively,  with  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  infections.  Three  subjects  (2%)  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 6 subjects (4%) in the SOCT arm had worst Grade 4 infections. Five 
subjects (3%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm had a Grade 5 TEAE of infection (2 subjects with COVID-
EMA/804955/2022

19, 1 subject with PML, 1 subject with hepatitis B reactivation, and 1 subject with sepsis; whereas no 
subjects in the SOCT arm had a Grade 5 TEAE of infection. 
The most frequently (in ≥ 5% of subjects) reported infection categories were unspecified infections (44 
subjects,  26%),  viral  infections  (26  subjects,  15%),  bacterial  infections  (16  subjects,  9%),  upper 
respiratory  tract  infections  (11  subjects,  6%),  and  opportunistic  infections  (8  subjects,  5%)  in  the 
axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and unspecified (40 subjects, 24%), bacterial infections (15 subjects, 9%), 
and viral infections (8 subjects, 5%) in the SOCT arm. Five subjects (3%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm  had  a  Grade  5  TEAE  of  infection  (2  subjects  with  COVID-19,  1  subject  with  PML,  1  subject  with 
hepatitis B reactivation, and 1 subject with sepsis); whereas no subjects in the SOCT arm had a Grade 
5 TEAE of infection. A Grade 1 COVID-19 infection was reported for one subject (1%) in the SOCT arm. 
Hypogammaglobulinemia 
Among subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel, 19 subjects (11%) had a hypogammaglobulinemia event, 
of  whom  all  subjects  had  TEAEs  with  a  PT  of  hypogammaglobulinemia  that  were  worst  Grade  1  (6 
subjects, 4%) or Grade 2 (13 subjects, 8%). 
Among  subjects  treated  with  the  SOCT,  1  subject  (1%)  had  at  least  one  worst  Grade  1 
hypogammaglobulinemia event (PT = hypogammaglobulinemia). 
Important Potential Risks (axicabtagene ciloleucel arm) 
No subject in either treatment arm had treatment-emergent aggravation of GVHD or treatment-related 
tumor  lysis  syndrome.  No  subject  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  tested  positive  for  RCR  or  was 
confirmed  to  be  antibody-positive  after  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  infusion,  or  had  a  new  malignancy 
considered by Kite to be secondary to axicabtagene. Cardiac symptoms, such as sinus tachycardia were 
identified.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs  
SAES were reported for 85 subjects (50%) treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel and 77 subjects (46%) 
treated with SOCT. The most frequently reported (≥ 5% of subjects) SAEs in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm were pyrexia (27 subjects, 16%), encephalopathy (17 subjects, 10%), hypotension (15 subjects, 
9%),  aphasia  (9  subjects,  5%)  and  pneumonia  (8  subjects,  5%);  and  in  the  SOCT  arm  were  febrile 
neutropenia (22 subjects, 13%), and acute kidney injury and pyrexia (8 subjects each, 5%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  (>  2%  of  subjects)  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  SAEs,  excluding  B  -cell 
lymphoma,  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  were  encephalopathy  (15  subjects,  9%),  aphasia  (8 
subjects, 5%), hypotension (7 subjects, 4%), and pneumonia (6 subjects, 4%); and in the SOCT arm 
were febrile neutropenia (22 subjects, 13%) and platelet count decreased (5 subjects, 3%). 
The most frequently reported (≥ 5% of subjects) axicabtagene ciloleucel-related SAEs were pyrexia (24 
subjects,  14%),  encephalopathy  (17  subjects,  10%),  hypotension  (15  subjects,  9%),  and  aphasia  (9 
subjects, 5%); and the most frequently reported SOCT-related SAE was febrile neutropenia (19 subjects, 
11%).

(1%) in each treatment arm with COVID-19 that occurred outside the AE reporting window. 
Laboratory findings 
Subject incidences of changes in clinical chemistry values reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in either the 
pooled axicabtagene ciloleucel population or the SOCT arm of ZUMA-7 are as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Increases  in  glucose  (90%  and  64%,  respectively),  and  decreases  in  glucose  (13%  and  8%, 
respectively), 
Increases in creatinine (83% and 77%, respectively),  
Increases in alanine aminotransferase (77% and 43%, respectively),  
Increases  in  aspartate  aminotransferase  (65%  and  33%,  respectively),  increases  in  alkaline 
phosphatase (37% and 43%, respectively), increases in bilirubin (34% and 11%, respectively), 
-  Decreases in calcium (96% and 48%, respectively),

Of  the  most  frequently  reported  changes  in  clinical chemistry  parameters  of  any  grade,  the  following 
were reported numerically more frequently (by ≥ 10%) in the pooled axicabtagene ciloleucel population 
than  in  the  SOCT  arm  of  ZUMA-7:  increases  in  glucose,  alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate 
aminotransferase,  and  bilirubin,  and  decreases  in  calcium,  albumin,  magnesium,  sodium,  potassium, 
and phosphate. 
The  subject  incidences  of  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  values  of  worst  Grade  3  or  higher  that  were 
reported in ≥ 10% of subjects in either treatment arm were as follows: increases in glucose (10% and 
5%, respectively), decreases in sodium (16% and 2%, respectively), and decreases in phosphate (23% 
and 5%).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subject discontinued treatment due to TEAE in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm. Two subjects in the 
SOCT arm discontinued treatment due to TEAEs of Grade 4 acute kidney injury and Grade 1 blood stem 
cell harvest failure. 
Post marketing experience 
Axicabtagene ciloleucel is approved under the trade name YESCARTA in 38 countries including the US, 
the European Economic Area (comprising 30 countries), United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, 
Israel, Japan, and China. 
A post-marketing risk mitigation program includes administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel at qualified 
sites that have demonstrated availability of tocilizumab for use in managing CRS and neurologic events 
and educational materials for healthcare providers and patients. A long-term post-marketing study will 
follow patients who have received YESCARTA for 15 years and will assess the long-term safety, assess 
the risk of new malignancy, further characterize important risks, and identify new signals. 
Post-marketing data are provided from the most recently available periodic safety update report/periodic 
benefit-risk  evaluation  report  for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  (source  m5.3.6).  As  of  17  April  2021,  808 
subjects  have  been  exposed  to  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  company-sponsored  interventional  clinical 
studies.  It  is  estimated  that  4,497  patients  have  been  exposed  to  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  in  post-
authorization use. No new identified or potential risks for axicabtagene ciloleucel have emerged following 
the commercialization of this product and the overall benefit-risk evaluation for axicabtagene ciloleucel 
continues to be positive. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive safety data package for DCO 18 March 2021. The number of 
patients treated in ZUMA-7 was n=170 in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and n=168 in the SOCT arm. 
The median actual follow-up times of subjects in the axicabtagene ciloleucel and SOCT arms were 19.6 
EMA/804955/2022 
Page 112/129 
 
 
 
 
  
 
months and 18.0 months, respectively. At the date of data cutoff (18 March 2021), the ZUMA-7 study 
has ended for 37% of subjects who had received axicabtagene ciloleucel, and 48% who had received ≥ 
1 dose of standard of care salvage chemotherapy. The primary reason for ending the study for subjects 
who received axicabtagene ciloleucel was death for 64 subjects (36%) and lost to follow-up for 2 subjects 
(1%). The primary reason for ending the study for subjects who received SOCT was death for 75 subjects 
(42%), withdrawal of consent for 7 subjects (4%), lost to follow-up for 2 subjects (1%), investigator 
decision for 1 subject (1%), and other reasons for 1 subject (1%).  
Generally, there are no differences observed in number and grading of TEAEs in ZUMA-7 related to the 
procedures  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  (leukapheresis,  lymphodepletion  and treatment),  when 
comparing with the other clinical trials in the axicabtagene ciloleucel treatment program. TEAEs in both 
treatment arms have been treated according to general toxicity management recommendations, were 
generally  manageable  and  resolved  as  of  DCO;  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  reported  in  either 
treatment  arm.  Regards  TEAEs  observed  in  the  SOC  arm,  which  mainly  are  pancytopenia, 
hypophosphatemia and febrile neutropenia, these can be considered specific side effect of agents in the 
permitted regimens for salvage SOCT, and there is no indication that number and/or grading of occurred 
TEAEs differ from them in the ZUMA-7 SOCT arm.  All subjects treated (100%) in both arms had ≥ 1 
TEAE. The number of grade 3 or higher TEAEs assessed related to the axicabtagene ciloleucel was n= 
112  subjects  (66%)  versus  n=131  (78%)  in  the  SOCT  arm.  In  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm,  85 
subjects (50%) had an SAE, and 72 subjects (42%) had a 3 or higher SAE. In the SOCT arm, 77 subjects 
(46%) had an SAE, and 67 subjects (40%) had a Grade 3 or higher SAE. The number of SAEs assessed 
related  to  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  and  SOCT,  respectively,  was  n=  63  subjects  (37%)  versus  n=59 
subjects  (35%).    Fatal  TEAEs  were  reported  for  7  subjects  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  and  2 
subjects in the SOCT arm. At the data cutoff date, 142 of 338 subjects (42%) in the safety analysis set 
had died, including 64 subjects (36%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm and 75 subjects (42%) in the 
SOCT arm. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
According  to  the  provided  data,  no  new  major  safety  concerns  arise  from  the  new  population  as  no 
additional  safety  issues  in  treatment  with  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  other  than  the  known  have  been 
identified.  Overall,  the  TEAEs  and  risks  are  similar  to  what  has  been  described  for  other  CAR  T  cell 
therapies and for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications, and are manageable with the current 
risk minimization measures presented in the SmPC.  
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 5.3. with this application.  
This risk management plan (RMP) is submitted with an extension of indication based on the results from 
Study  KTE-C19-107  (ZUMA-7),  a  phase  3,  randomised,  open-label  study  evaluating  the  efficacy  of 
axicabtagene ciloleucel versus standard of care therapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). 
EMA/804955/2022 
Page 113/129 
 
 
 
 
  
The  MAH  submitted  RMP  version  7.1  with  the  responses  to  questions,  sign  off  data  8  June  2022, 
addressing the assessment requests. 
The MAH took the opportunity to upversion the RMP to version 8.0 to align the annexes version with 
another similar product from the same MAH; no changes in the body of the RMP were introduced. 
The CAT received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable.  
The CAT endorsed this advice without changes. 
The CAT endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 8.0 with the following content: 
General comments  
The background for the RMP update was an update of the indication to include treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed or refractory high-grade b-cell lymphoma (HGBL). The restriction “after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy” in the indication DLBCL was removed; however, this still applies to 
PMBCL. 
Safety concerns 
Module SI. Epidemiology of the indications and target population 
Module SI ‘Epidemiology of the indication and target population’ was updated satisfactorily to include 
epidemiology data for the proposed new indication of adult patients with relapsed or refractory high-
grade B-cell lymphoma.  
Module SIII. Clinical trial exposure 
Module SIII ‘Clinical trial exposure’ was updated with regard to information from ZUMA-7 about 
demographics, e.g. follow-up time, age group, gender and ethnic origin from ongoing clinical trials. In 
addition, cumulative subject exposure by study, age and race has been presented in tabular format, 
which is endorsed. 
Module SIV. Populations not studied in clinical trials 
Module SIV ‘Populations not studied in clinical trials’ – SIV.1 was updated with the ZUMA-7 study 
exclusion criteria. Additionally, section SIV.2 and SIV.3 were updated to include data from the ZUMA-7 
study. The proposed changes are acceptable.  
Module SV Post-authorisation experience 
Module SV ‘Post-authorisation experience’ was updated with a new estimate of the post-marketing 
exposure stratified by geographic area. This is endorsed.

Module SVII. Identified and potential risks 
In the Module SVII, section SVII.3.1 ‘Presentation of important identified risks and important potential 
risks’ has been adequately updated with data from the ZUMA-7 study.  
In addition, the presentation of important identified and potential risks has been substantially revised 
and mainly shortened. The revisions are considered of editorial nature and represent an overall 
improvement of the messages in line with the RMP guidance. The changes are therefore acceptable. 
In the characterisation of the risks, data from PASS KT-EU-471-0117 has been included, which is 
endorsed.  
In section SVII.3.2 ‘Presentation of missing information’, has been updated with data from the PASS 
KT-EU-471-0117, the cumulative post-marketing surveillance and ZUMA-7, as applicable. This is 
endorsed.  
Module SVIII. Summary of the safety concerns 
No changes were proposed by the MAH to the summary of safety concerns. This is considered 
acceptable as initially no new safety concerns were identified from the submitted data.

Only editorial changes were made to the overview of on-going and planned additional 
pharmacovigilance activities, which are acceptable.  
Pending the outcome of this procedure and with the next regulatory opportunity, the MAH is reminded 
to reflect the extension of indication in future amendments of the study protocol of the imposed 
category one KT-EU-471-0117 PASS.  
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
The study(ies) in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of 
the risk minimisation measures.

The MAH updated the overview of additional risk minimisation activity with regards to the prescriber 
survey (KT-EU-471-0116) which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of HCP educational material study. 
Final results of this study were submitted in June 2021 (EMEA/H/C/004480/II/0040) and this 
procedure is still ongoing. Tentatively, pending the final outcome of this procedure, the information 
added to the RMP is considered acceptable.  
With regards to the controlled distribution programme, the MAH updated the table with data from the 
registry PASS (KT-EU-471-0117) concerning CRS, which is acknowledged.   
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
Part VI, summary of the risk management plan has been updated to include the new indication. The 
updates made in RMP Parts I through IV have been correctly reflected in the RMP summary.  
2.8.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of the extended indication, sections 4.1, 4.8, 5.1. and 5.2.of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
EMA/804955/2022 
Page 123/129 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The MAH also took the opportunity to amend the product information with minor editorial changes. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the 
addition of the adult r/r DLBCL and HGBL indication to the currently approved PIL has not introduced 
significant changes to the text or layout. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) that relapses within 12  
months from completion of, or is refractory to, first-line chemoimmunotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for the first-line treatment of DLBCL is R CHOP, which results in 5 year and 
10-year EFS rates of 47% and 35%, respectively, and 5-year and 10 year OS rates of 58% and 44%, 
respectively in patients 60 to 80 years of age. For patients 18 to 60 years of age treated with R-CHOP, 
3-year EFS and OS rates are 79% and 93%, respectively. The optimal therapy for the first-line treatment 
of  patients  with  HGBL  has  not  been  established,  and  there  is  no  consensus  whether  regimens  more 
intensive than R-CHOP are required; 4 year OS rates of 54.5% and 49.6% have been reported for R-
EPOCH and R-CHOP, respectively.  
Standard second-line therapy in the curative setting for LBCL is comprised of rituximab and platinum-
containing salvage chemoimmunotherapy followed by HDT and auto-SCT for those who are eligible. The 
efficacy of this regimen has not been fully assessed for HGBL. While HDT auto SCT has curative potential, 
only half of patients respond to second-line salvage chemotherapy and are able to proceed to auto SCT, 
and  poor  outcomes  are  observed  for  patients  who cannot  undergo  auto-SCT.  Besides  chemoresistant 
disease,  other  reasons  for  patients not  being eligible  to  receive  second  line therapy  include  failure to 
mobilize  CD34+  stem  cells  for  auto  SCT,  poor  performance  status,  organ  dysfunction,  comorbidities, 
unresolved treatment emergent toxicities, or older age. For patients who receive second-line therapy, 
outcomes are particularly poor for those with primary refractory disease or early relapse after first-line 
therapies and for patients with higher sAAIPI scores. 
More  recently,  2  therapies  (polatuzumab  vedotin  and  tafasitamab)  were  approved  for  transplant 
ineligible  patients  with  r/r  DLBCL,  and  although  these  new  treatment  options  offer  incremental 
improvements  in  response  rates,  duration  of  responses  remain  suboptimal  and  neither  therapy  has 
demonstrated curative outcome. Thus, a need remains for alternative second line therapies with curative 
intent, including those with a mechanism of action independent of chemotherapy sensitivity.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
ZUMA-7 is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of axicabtagene 
ciloleucel versus SOCT in adult subjects with r/r LBCL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
EFS (stratified HR 0.398, 95%CI 0.308, 0.514), ORR and CR data are considered favourable and indicate 
a superior efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a second-line therapy in adult subjects with r/r LBCL 
compared with SOCT. 
The  risk  of  an  EFS  event  for  subjects  in  the  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  arm  was  significantly  reduced 
compared with the SOCT arm. Median EFS time was 6.3 months longer in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm  compared  with  the  SOCT  arm.  The  KM  estimated  event-free  rate  was  higher  for  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel relative to SOCT. Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in a significant improvement 
in ORR compared with SOCT. The CR rate was 2-fold higher (65% vs 32%) in the axicabtagene ciloleucel 
arm compared with the SOCT arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Issues in the conduct of study result in uncertainties regarding the derived effects: measures such as a 
firewall to fully blind the study team in charge with the conduct of study where not appropriately pre-
specified and hence decisions to alter the study might have been potentially made in the light of the 
accrued  data.  Modifications  to  the  (interim)  analysis  plan  for  OS  (multiple  changes  to  the  timing  and 
number of interim analyses, changes and contradictions in the approach to control for multiplicity) add 
uncertainty and potentially render the type 1 error control for OS questionable. 
EFS estimates might be biased in favour of axicabtagene ciloleucel. It is acknowledged, however, that 
this does not impact the derivation and interpretation of OS, and should not impact EFS to an extend 
which would render the benefit questionable. An additional limitation is the immaturity of the OS data. 
While  there  are  a  number  of  CD19  negative  patients  who  benefitted  from  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, a clear-cut and definite superiority of axicabtagene ciloleucel vs. SOCT 
cannot be established in CD19 patients, moreover, outcome data in CD19- patients are inferior to the 
outcomes found in CD19 positive patients. The data are less reliable due to the lower patient numbers, 
yet these tendencies are clearly observable.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel are the generally known identified risks, which are CRS, 
neurotoxicity and hematotoxicity. Comparing both treatment arms in ZUMA-7, the following observations 
were made for the axicabtagene ciloleucel arm compared to the SOC-arm:  
-  Higher incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia any grade 
-  Higher incidence of infections any grade  
-  Higher incidence of laboratory abnormalities any grade 
-  Higher incidence of cardiac symptoms any grade (sinus tachycardia, possibly associated with 
CRS)

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Generally, the spectrum of the unfavourable effects of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a CAR T cell product is 
known,  and  currently  no  major  additional  issues  seem  to  arise.  The  disadvantage  and  limitation, 
respectively, is that the MAH applies for an indication extension with a rather limited follow-up time (DCO 
of 18 March 2021: median follow-up of 19.6 months for subjects treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel), 
which revealed some uncertainties.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The strength of the findings is given by the fact that the proposed new indication is based on a trial first 
of its kind in the field of CAR-T cells: a randomized trial comparing axicabtagene ciloleucel versus SOCT 
in adult subjects with r/r LBCL. The proposed indication is supported by the data obtained in the ZUMA-
7 study: ZUMA-7 demonstrated superior efficacy of axicabtagene ciloleucel as a second-line therapy in 
adult subjects with r/r LBCL compared with SOCT. The observed superiority based on EFS, ORR, CR rates 
indicate  that  clinically  meaningful  benefit  could  be  achieved  in  a  second  line  therapy  setting  in  the 
intended population of patients with r/r LBCL. The safety profile of axicabtagene ciloleucel as second-
line treatment in the intended target population appears acceptable, no new safety concerns have been 
identified.  Overall,  the  TEAEs  and  risks  are  similar  to  what  has  been  described  for  other  CAR  T  cell 
therapies and for axicabtagene ciloleucel in the other indications, and are manageable with the current 
risk minimization measures presented in the SmPC. 
The proposed new indication introduced with this extension includes HGBL. The WHO classifications from 
2016/ 2022 indicate HGBL as an independent entity within the LBCLs. Inclusion of both DLBCL and HGBL 
subtypes as disease entities are supported by the efficacy data, and mechanism of action based on the 
expression of CD19. Importantly, the sample size of patients enrolled in the ZUMA-7 trial diagnosed with 
HGBL (HGBL: 43 pts, 24%; DLBCL: 110 pts, 61%) was considered sufficient to support the inclusion of 
this indication. 
The  new  extension  of  indication  contains  a  limitation  to  patients  relapsing  within  12 months  from 
completion of first-line chemoimmunotherapy. Indeed, patients with late relapses eligible for standard 
of  care  and  higher  chance  of  definitive  treatment  with  HDT-ASCT  have  not  been  enrolled.  An 
extrapolation for later relapsing patients was not supported: while indirect comparisons for EFS and OS 
are difficult to interpret, the ORR of 88% with salvage chemotherapy (CORAL  data) in later relapsing 
patients  is  similar  to  the ORR  of  83%  with  Yescarta  in  early  relapsing  patients  indicating  comparable 
antitumour  activity.  In  order  to  accommodate  the  study  cohort  and  the  sought  indication,  the  MAH 
modified the indication to contain the 12 months limit, which was endorsed. 
In  the  ZUMA-7  study,  HDT  +  auto-SCT  were  parts  of  the  treatment  protocol  in  the  control  arm  for 
patients  intended  to  proceed  to  HDT-auto-SCT  if  there  was  a  response  to  second-line  therapy.  Even 
though  transplant  eligibility  was  not  specifically  addressed  as  criterion  for  axicabtagene  ciloleucel 
treatment eligibility it is likely that investigators only selected patients for the trial that could also be 
eligible for the SOCT arm. Thus, patients not eligible for HDT/SCT were not part of the trial population. 
From an efficacy point of view, it is acceptable to extrapolate the result from the trial to the population 
that was not included. Since safety has been established in later line settings that also included more 
advanced and likely more fragile patients extrapolation of safety is also accepted. Furthermore, there 
are  not  clearly  defined  criteria  for  transplant  eligibility  that  could  be  used  for  defining  the  target 
population. 
Some CD19 IHC negative patients seem to have benefitted from axicabtagene ciloleucel therapy, but a 
definite  superiority  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  vs.  SOCT  cannot  be  established  for  CD19  IHC  negative 
patients. On the other hand, data indicate that the outcome in CD19-negative patients may be worse 
compared to CD19-positive patients. However, due to the low patient numbers a substantial uncertainty 
on the efficacy in CD 19-negative patients remains. These findings would point to sensitivity issues of 
the IHC detection method, also known in the literature. Still, literature data clearly show that quantitative 
antigen  density  in  LBCL  assessed  by  flow  cytometry  correlates  with  outcomes  after  axicabtagene 
ciloleucel therapy. It is clear that further measures are required to address CD19 negativity in the future.

The  current  ESMO  guideline  on  DLBCL  diagnosis  (published  in  Ann  Oncol  (2015)  26  (suppl  5): v116-
v125.)  states  that:  “A  morphological  diagnosis  of  DLBCL  should  be  confirmed  in  all  cases  by 
immunophenotypic  investigations,  either  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  or  flow  cytometry  or  a 
combination  of  both  techniques”.  The  MAH  implemented/committed  to  two  measures,  which  were 
considered sufficient to address these aspects, as indicated under Section 3.7.3. below.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Benefit  indicated  by  the  data  appear  to  outweigh  the  observed  unfavourable  effects,  at  least  in  the 
majority of the patients.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Appropriate wording was added in the SmPC section 4.4 indicating that potential risks and benefits 
associated with treatment of CD19-negative patients with Yescarta should be considered. Additionally, 
the MAH committed to further study the correlation of axicabtagene ciloleucel efficacy and CD19 
expression profile, as assessed by flow cytometry and IHC at the time of relapse, by performing a 
dedicated interventional trial. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  axicabtagene  ciloleucel  for  treatment  of  r/r  DLBCL  and  HGBL  in  adult  subjects  as 
second-line treatment is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CAT considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I, IIIA and 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
IIIB 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) for Yescarta; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. Version 8.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the product information with minor editorial 
changes.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
EMA/804955/2022

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, IIIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CAT and CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Yescarta is not similar to Kymriah, Minjuvi, 
Polivy within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CAT has not considered the claim for additional market protection since an additional 
year of market protection was already granted as part of a previous variation (Yescarta II/42). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope

Elderly (75 years)
Metalyse should be administered with caution in the elderly ( 75 years) due to a higher bleeding risk 
(see information on bleeding in section 4.4 and on the STREAM study in section 5.1).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Metalyse in children (below 18 years) have not been established. No data 
are available.
Adjunctive therapy
Antithrombotic adjunctive therapy with platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants should be administered 
according to the current relevant treatment guidelines for the management of patients with 
ST-elevation myocardial infarction.
For coronary intervention see section 4.4.
Unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin have been used as antithrombotic adjunctive therapy in clinical 
studies with Metalyse. 
Acetylsalicylic acid should be initiated as soon as possible after symptom onset and continued with 
lifelong treatment unless it is contraindicated.
Method of administration
The reconstituted solution should be administered intravenously and is for immediate use. The 
reconstituted solution is a clear and colourless to slightly yellow solution.
The required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over approximately 10 
seconds.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to 
gentamicin (a trace residue from the manufacturing process). If treatment with Metalyse is 
nevertheless considered to be necessary, facilities for resuscitation should be immediately available in 
case of need.
Furthermore, Metalyse is contraindicated in the following situations because thrombolytic therapy is 
associated with a higher risk of bleeding:

Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Coronary intervention
If primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is scheduled according to the current relevant 
treatment guidelines, tenecteplase (see section 5.1 ASSENT-4 study) should not be given.
Patients who cannot undergo primary PCI within one hour as recommended by guidelines and receive
tenecteplase as primary coronary recanalization treatment should be transferred without delay to a 
coronary intervention capable facility for angiography and timely adjunctive coronary intervention 
within 6-24 hours or earlier if medically indicated (see section 5.1 STREAM study).
Bleeding
The most common complication encountered during tenecteplase therapy is bleeding. The concomitant 
use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during tenecteplase 
therapy, bleeding from recent puncture site may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy requires 
careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and venous 
puncture sites, cutdown sites and needle puncture sites). The use of rigid catheters as well as 
intramuscular injections and non-essential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment 
with tenecteplase.
Most frequently haemorrhage at the injection site, and occasionally genitourinary and gingival 
bleeding were observed. 
Should serious bleeding occur, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, concomitant heparin administration 
should be terminated immediately. Administration of protamine should be considered if heparin has 
been administered within 4 hours before the onset of bleeding. In the few patients who fail to respond 
to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. Transfusion of 
cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets should be considered with clinical and laboratory 
4
reassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is desirable with 
cryoprecipitate infusion. Antifibrinolytic agents are available as a last alternative. In the following 
conditions, the risk of tenecteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the 
anticipated benefits:
-

Systolic blood pressure > 160 mm Hg, see section 4.3
Cerebrovascular disease
Recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within the past 10 days)
High likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g., mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation
Any known recent (within the past 2 days) intramuscular injection
Advanced age, i.e. patients over 75 years
Low body weight < 60 kg
Patients receiving oral anticoagulants: The use of Metalyse may be considered when dosing or 
time since the last intake of anticoagulant treatment makes residual efficacy unlikely and if 
appropriate test(s) of anticoagulant activity for the product(s) concerned show no clinically 
relevant activity on the coagulation system (e.g. INR ≤ 1.3 for vitamin K antagonists or other 
relevant test(s) for other oral anticoagulants are within the respective upper limit of normal).
Arrhythmias
Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. Reperfusion 
arrhythmias may lead to cardiac arrest, can be life threatening and may require the use of conventional 
antiarrhythmic therapies. It is recommended that antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or 
ventricular tachyarrhythmias (pacemaker, defibrillator) is available when tenecteplase is administered.
GPIIb/IIIa antagonists
Concomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.
Hypersensitivity/Re-administration
No sustained antibody formation to the tenecteplase molecule has been observed after treatment. 
However there is no systematic experience with re-administration of tenecteplase. Caution is needed 
when administering tenecteplase to persons with a known hypersensitivity (other than anaphylactic 
reaction) to the active substance, to any of the excipients, or to gentamicin (a residue from the 
manufacturing process). If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy should be initiated. In any case, tenecteplase should not be re-
administered before assessment of haemostatic factors like fibrinogen, plasminogen and alpha2-
antiplasmin.
Paediatric population
Metalyse is not recommended for use in children (below 18 years) due to a lack of data on safety and 
efficacy.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interaction studies with tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly administered in 
patients with AMI have been performed. However, the analysis of data from more than 12 000 patients 
treated during phase I, II and III did not reveal any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal 
products commonly used in patients with AMI and concomitantly used with tenecteplase.
Drugs affecting coagulation/platelet function
Medicinal products that affect coagulation or those that alter platelet function (e.g. ticlopidine, 
clopidogrel, LMWH) may increase the risk of bleeding prior to, during or after tenecteplase therapy.
5
Concomitant use of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists increases bleeding risk.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There is a limited amount of data from the use of Metalyse in pregnant women.
Nonclinical data performed with tenecteplase have shown bleeding with secondary mortality of dams 
due to the known pharmacological activity of the active substance and in a few cases abortion and 
resorption of the foetus occurred (effects only have been observed with repeated dose administration). 
Tenecteplase is not considered to be teratogenic (please see section 5.3).
The benefit of treatment must be evaluated against the potential risks in case of myocardial infarction 
during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. 
Caution should be exercised when Metalyse is administered to a nursing woman and a decision must 
be made whether breast-feeding should be discontinued within the first 24 hours after administration 
of Metalyse.
Fertility
Clinical data as well as nonclinical studies on fertility are not available for tenecteplase (Metalyse).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Not relevant.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Haemorrhage is a very common undesirable effect associated with the use of tenecteplase. The type of 
haemorrhage is predominantly superficial at the injection site. Ecchymoses are observed commonly 
but usually do not require any specific action. Death and permanent disability are reported in patients 
who have experienced stroke (including intracranial bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antithrombotic agents, enzymes; ATC code: B01A D11
Mechanism of action
Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA 
by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus 
(blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the 
fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to 
inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA.
Pharmacodynamic effects
After administration of tenecteplase dose dependent consumption of 2-antiplasmin (the fluid-phase 
inhibitor of plasmin) with consequent increase in the level of systemic plasmin generation have been 
observed. This observation is consistent with the intended effect of plasminogen activation. In 
comparative studies a less than 15% reduction in fibrinogen and a less than 25% reduction in 
plasminogen were observed in subjects treated with the maximum dose of tenecteplase (10 000 U, 
corresponding to 50 mg), whereas alteplase caused an approximately 50% decrease in fibrinogen and 
plasminogen levels. No clinically relevant antibody formation was detected at 30 days.
8
Clinical efficacy and safety
Patency data from the phase I and II angiographic studies suggest that tenecteplase, administered as a 
single intravenous bolus, is effective in dissolving blood clots in the infarct-related artery of subjects 
experiencing an AMI on a dose related basis.
ASSENT-2
A large scale mortality trial (ASSENT-2) in approx. 17 000 patients showed that tenecteplase is 
therapeutically equivalent to alteplase in reducing mortality (6.2% for both treatments, at 30 days, 
upper limit of the 95% CI for the relative risk ratio 1.124) and that the use of tenecteplase is associated 
with a significantly lower incidence of non-intracranial bleedings (26.4% vs. 28.9%, p=0.0003). This 
translates into a significantly lower need of transfusions (4.3% vs. 5.5%, p=0.0002). Intracranial 
haemorrhage occurred at a rate of 0.93% vs. 0.94% for tenecteplase and alteplase, respectively.
Coronary patency and limited clinical outcome data showed that AMI patients have been successfully 
treated later than 6 hours after symptom onset.
ASSENT-4
The ASSENT-4 PCI study was designed to show if in 4 000 patients with large myocardial infarctions 
pre-treatment with full dose tenecteplase and concomitant single bolus of up to 4 000 IU 
unfractionated heparin administered prior to primary PCI to be performed within 60 to 180 minutes 
leads to better outcomes than primary PCI alone. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1 667 
randomised patients due to a numerically higher mortality in the facilitated PCI group receiving 
tenecteplase. The occurrence of the primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or 
congestive heart failure within 90 days, was significantly higher in the group receiving the exploratory 
regimen of tenecteplase followed by routine immediate PCI: 18.6% (151/810) compared to 13.4% 
(110/819) in the PCI only group, p=0.0045. This significant difference between the groups for the 
primary endpoint at 90 days was already present in-hospital and at 30 days. 
Numerically all of the components of the clinical composite endpoint were in favour of the PCI only 
regimen: death: 6.7% vs. 4.9% p=0.14; cardiogenic shock: 6.3% vs. 4.8% p=0.19; congestive heart 
failure: 12.0% vs. 9.2% p=0.06 respectively. The secondary endpoints re-infarction and repeat target 
vessel revascularisation were significantly increased in the group pre-treated with tenecteplase: re-
infarction: 6.1% vs. 3.7% p=0.0279; repeat target vessel revascularisation: 6.6% vs. 3.4% p=0.0041.
The following adverse events occurred more frequently with tenecteplase prior to PCI: intracranial 
haemorrhage: 1% vs. 0% p=0.0037; stroke: 1.8% vs. 0% p<0.0001; major bleeds: 5.6% vs. 4.4% 
p=0.3118; minor bleeds: 25.3% vs. 19.0% p= 0.0021; blood transfusions: 6.2% vs. 4.2% p=0.0873; 
abrupt vessel closure: 1.9% vs. 0.1% p=0.0001. 
STREAM study
The STREAM study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a pharmaco-invasive strategy 
versus a strategy of standard primary PCI in patients presenting with ST elevation acute myocardial 
infarction within 3 hours of onset of symptoms not able to undergo primary PCI within one hour of 
first medical contact. The pharmaco-invasive strategy consisted of early fibrinolytic treatment with 
bolus tenecteplase and additional antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy followed by angiography 
within 6-24 hours or rescue coronary intervention. 
The study population consisted of 1 892 patients randomised by means of an interactive voice 
response system. The primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart 
failure or re-infarction within 30 days, was observed in 12.4% (116/939) of the pharmaco-invasive 
arm versus 14.3% (135/943) in the primary PCI arm (relative risk 0.86 (0.68-1.09)).
Single components of the primary composite endpoint for the pharmaco-invasive strategy versus 
primary PCI respectively were observed with the following frequencies:

prior to dose reduction. The bounds of the confidence interval of the observed incidences prior and 
after dose reduction are overlapping.
In patients ≥ 75 years the observed incidence of the primary efficacy composite end point for the

(95% CI: 17.4-35.7) versus 25/88 (24.8%) (95% CI: 19.3-39.0). In both groups the bounds of the 
confidence interval of the observed incidences prior and post dose reduction are overlapping.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption and distribution
Tenecteplase is an intravenously administered, recombinant protein that activates plasminogen. 
Following intravenous bolus administration of 30 mg tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction, the initially estimated tenecteplase plasma concentration was 6.45 ± 3.60 µg/mL (mean ± 
SD). The distribution phase represents 31% ± 22% to 69% ± 15% (mean ± SD) of the total AUC 
following the administration of doses ranges from 5 to 50 mg.
Data on tissue distribution were obtained in studies with radioactively labelled tenecteplase in rats. 
The main organ to which tenecteplase distributed was the liver. It is not known whether and to which 
extent tenecteplase binds to plasma proteins in humans. The mean residence time (MRT) in the body 
10
is approximately 1 h and the mean (± SD) volume of distribution at the steady-state (Vss) ranged from 
6.3 ± 2 L to 15 ± 7 L.
Biotransformation
Tenecteplase is cleared from circulation by binding to specific receptors in the liver followed by 
catabolism to small peptides. Binding to hepatic receptors is, however, reduced compared to native t-
PA, resulting in a prolonged half-life. 
Elimination
After single intravenous bolus injection of tenecteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction, 
tenecteplase antigen exhibits biphasic elimination from plasma. There is no dose dependence of 
tenecteplase clearance in the therapeutic dose range. The initial, dominant half-life is 24 ± 5.5 (mean 
±SD) min, which is 5 times longer than native t-PA. The terminal half-life is 129 ± 87 min, and 
plasma clearance is 119 ± 49 ml/min. 
Increasing body weight resulted in a moderate increase of tenecteplase clearance, and increasing age 
resulted in a slight decrease of clearance. Women exhibit in general lower clearance than men, but this 
can be explained by the generally lower body weight of women.
Linearity/Non-Linearity
The dose linearity analysis based on AUC suggested that tenecteplase exhibits non-linear 
pharmacokinetics in the dose range studied, i.e. 5 to 50 mg.
Renal and hepatic impairment
Because elimination of tenecteplase is through the liver, it is not expected that renal dysfunction will 
affect its the pharmacokinetics. This is also supported by animal data. However, the effect of renal and 
hepatic dysfunction on pharmacokinetics of tenecteplase in humans has not been specifically 
investigated. Accordingly, there is no guidance for the adjustment to tenecteplase dose in patients with 
hepatic and severe renal insufficiency.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Intravenous single dose administration in rats, rabbits and dogs resulted only in dose-dependent and 
reversible alterations of the coagulation parameters with local haemorrhage at the injection site, which 
was regarded as a consequence of the pharmacodynamic effect of tenecteplase. Multiple-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and dogs confirmed these above-mentioned observations, but the study duration was 
limited to two weeks by antibody formation to the human protein tenecteplase, which resulted in 
anaphylaxis.
Safety pharmacology data in cynomolgus monkeys revealed reduction of blood pressure followed by 
changes of ECG, but these occurred at exposures that were considerably higher than the clinical 
exposure.
With regard to the indication and the single dose administration in humans, reproductive toxicity 
testing was limited to an embryotoxicity study in rabbits, as a sensitive species. Tenecteplase induced 
total litter deaths during the mid-embryonal period. When tenecteplase was given during the mid- or 
late-embryonal period maternal animals showed vaginal bleeding on the day after the first dose. 
Secondary mortality was observed 1-2 days later. Data on the foetal period are not available.
Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity are not expected for this class of recombinant proteins and 
genotoxicity and carcinogenicity testing were not necessary.
11
No local irritation of the blood vessel was observed after intravenous, intra-arterial or paravenous 
administration of the final formulation of tenecteplase.

Check that the cap of the vial is still intact.
Remove the flip-off cap from the vial.
Open the top of the vial adapter. Remove the tip-cap from the pre-filled syringe with the 
solvent. Then immediately screw the pre-filled syringe on the vial adapter tightly and penetrate 
the vial stopper in the middle with the spike of the vial adapter.
Add the solvent into the vial by pushing the syringe plunger down slowly to avoid foaming.
Keep the syringe attached to the vial adapter and reconstitute by swirling gently.
The reconstituted solution for injection results in a colourless to pale yellow, clear solution. 
Only clear solution without particles should be used.
Directly before the solution will be administered, invert the vial with the syringe still attached, 
so that the syringe is below the vial.
Transfer the appropriate volume of Metalyse reconstituted solution into the syringe, based on 
the patient’s weight.
10. Unscrew the syringe from the vial adapter.
11. A pre-existing intravenous line may be used for administration of Metalyse in sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution only. No other medicinal product should be added to the injection 
solution.
12. Metalyse is to be administered to the patient, intravenously in about 10 seconds. It should not be 
administered in a line containing glucose as Metalyse is incompatible with glucose solution.
The line should be flushed after Metalyse injection for a proper delivery.
13.
14. Any unused reconstituted solution should be discarded.
Alternatively, the reconstitution can be performed with a needle instead of the included vial adapter.
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Metalyse is and what it is used for
Metalyse is a powder and solvent for solution for injection. 
Metalyse belongs to a group of medicines called thrombolytic agents. These medicines help to 
dissolve blood clots. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator.
Metalyse is used to treat myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) within 6 hours after the onset of 
symptoms and helps to dissolve the blood clots that have formed in the blood vessels of the heart. This 
helps to prevent the damage caused by heart attacks and has been shown to save lives. 
2. What you need to know before you receive Metalyse
Metalyse will not be prescribed and given by your doctor


if you have previously had a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction (severe hypersensitivity) 
to tenecteplase, to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) or to
gentamicin (a trace residue from the manufacturing process). If treatment with Metalyse is 
nevertheless considered to be necessary, facilities for reanimation should be immediately 
available in case of need;
if you have, or have recently had, an illness that increases your risk of bleeding (haemorrhage), 
including:
 a bleeding disorder or tendency to bleed (haemorrhage)
 stroke (cerebrovascular event)
 very high, uncontrolled blood pressure
 a head injury
 severe liver disease
 a stomach ulcer (peptic ulcer)
 varicose veins in the gullet (oesophageal varices)
 abnormality of the blood vessels (e.g. an aneurysm)
 certain tumours
32
 inflammation of the lining around the heart (pericarditis); inflammation or infection of the 
heart valves (endocarditis)
 dementia;




if you are taking tablets/capsules used to ”thin” the blood, such as coumarin derivatives like
warfarin (anti-coagulants);
if you have an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis);
if you have recently had major surgery including surgery to your brain or spine;
if you have been given cardiopulmonary resuscitation (chest compressions) for more than 2 
minutes duration, in the last two weeks.
Warnings and precautions
Your doctor will take special care with Metalyse









if you have had any allergic reaction other than a sudden life-threatening allergic reaction 
(severe hypersensitive) to tenecteplase, to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) or to gentamicin (a trace residue from the manufacturing process);
if you have high blood pressure;
if you have problems with circulation of blood in the brain (cerebrovascular disease);
if you have had gastrointestinal (gut) or genitourinary bleeding within the last ten days (this may 
cause blood in stools or urine);
if you have a heart valve abnormality (e.g. mitral stenosis) with an abnormal heart rhythm (e.g. 
atrial fibrillation);
if you have had an intramuscular injection in the last two days;
if you are aged over 75 years;
if you weigh less than 60 kg;
if you have ever received Metalyse before.
Children and adolescents
The use of Metalyse in children and adolescents up to the age of 18 years is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Metalyse
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before you are given this medicine.
3.
How is Metalyse administered
The doctor calculates your dose of Metalyse according to your bodyweight, based on the following 
scheme:
Bodyweight (kg)
less than 60
60 to 70
70 to 80
80 to 90
above 90
Metalyse (U)
6 000
7 000
8 000
9 000
10 000
Your doctor will give you the medicinal product to prevent blood clotting in addition to Metalyse, as 
soon as possible after your chest pain starts.
Metalyse is given by a single injection into a vein by a doctor who is experienced in the use of this 
type of medicinal product.
33
Your doctor will give Metalyse as soon as possible after your chest pain starts as a single dose.
